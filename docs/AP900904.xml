<HEAD>Prisoner Disputes Ties to IRA; Promises to Follow Bail Conditions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Irish man imprisoned here for seven years in
an immigration dispute testified Tuesday that he's quit the Irish
Republican Army and would abide by all bail conditions if released.
   Joseph Doherty, 35, faces a life sentence in the United Kingdom
for the 1980 slaying of a British officer. Doherty escaped from a
Belfast prison in 1981 and fled to the United States on the orders
of an IRA superior. He was captured here in 1983 and has been held
in a Manhattan jail since.
   At a bail hearing, Doherty said he would return to the United
Kingdom if his bid for political asylum in the United States fails.
   ``If I were to go back to face the hangman's rope, I would go
back,'' Doherty said during four hours of testimony. ``I would pay
my own ticket and gladly go back, go back graciously on that plane
with no malice to the United States.''
   Doherty has fought extradition to Britain since his arrest.
   He has acknowledged that the British officer was killed in a
gunfight between troops and his four-man IRA unit, but claims the
fighting was political and that he would be persecuted if forced to
return.
   U.S. District Judge Miriam G. Cedarbaum is considering a request
that Doherty be freed on an $800,000 bail package pending
resolution of the asylum request.
   His say his right to due process has been violated by his
lengthy imprisonment.
   Doherty's plight has become a rallying point among
Irish-Americans here. He has been honorary grand marshal of the St.
Patrick's Day parade and has a Manhattan street named for him. The
courtroom was filled with supporters Tuesday, including three
congressman and several local politicians.
   Cedarbaum sought Doherty's testimony to help decide whether he
is a flight risk.
   The U.S. government, which opposes his release, will present
witnesses at a later hearing, after which Cedarbaum will rule.
   Doherty testified that he resigned from the IRA when he came to
the United States and has had no contact with its members.
   The armed group is fighting to wrest Northern Ireland from
British rule and unite it with the Irish Republic.
   Even if the IRA wanted him, ``I would refuse to go back to them
because of my commitment to the court and the provisions of bail
and also to these people in the back,'' Doherty said. ``My life is
minuscule compared to the Irish-American community.''
   However, U.S. Attorney Otto Obermaier sought to discredit
Doherty, stressing his use of a false passport to enter the United
States and a false Social Security number to get work.
   A federal appeals court ruled this summer that Doherty has the
right to seek asylum here.

<HEAD>Stuart Case Prosecutor Seeks Override Of Attorney-Client Privilege</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Tuesday AMs report.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The answers to the case in which a man concocted a
story about a robber shooting him and his pregnant wife may never
be known unless the state's highest court overrules attorney-client
privilege.
   The husband, Charles Stuart, has since committed suicide, and
prosecutors are asking the court to force Stuart's attorney to
disclose conversations they had before the hoax unraveled.
   It may provide the only break for prosecutors considering
charges against Stuart's brother, who says he was an unwitting
accomplice.
   Attorneys for the Stuart family will contend in hearings set for
this week that attorney-client privilege remains intact. And
although prosecutors will argue the privilege should be overridden
in the interest of justice, some legal observers say that is shaky
ground at best.
   ``There's not much precedent for this,'' said Phyllis Goldfarb,
a professor at the Boston College Law School.
   Carol Stuart, 30, was shot in the head on the night of Oct. 23,
minutes after she and her husband drove away from a prenatal class
at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
   Wounded himself, Stuart called police and guided them to his
location using his car's cellular telephone. His dramatic,
anguished plea for help over the telephone was widely broadcast.
Mrs. Stuart died hours after the attack; her prematurely delivered
son died 17 days after that.
   Stuart claimed a black man had kidnapped them, forced them to
drive to a deserted area, robbed and then shot them. Many saw the
incident as a symbol of urban crime.
   Then, on Jan. 3, Matthew Stuart went to authorities and
implicated his brother in the shooting. Charles Stuart leaped to
his death from a bridge the next day.
   Nearly a year after the crime, the grand jury investigating the
case has stalled over whether Matthew Stuart's role was really that
of an unwitting accomplice as he claimed.
   Prosecutors want the privilege broken, in order to learn whether
Stuart told his lawyer, John Dawley, that Matthew was involved in a
plot to kill Mrs. Stuart and cover up the crime by staging a fake
robbery.
   According to a judge's memorandum, the grand jury was told that
Matthew was to meet his brother at a predetermined location Oct. 23
to get items that later would be claimed to have been stolen, and
an insurance claim would be filed.
   The grand jury, according to the report, was told Matthew pulled
alongside his brother's car and talked to him, but was not aware
his brother was wounded or that Mrs. Stuart was in the car.
   Matthew told police his brother passed him several items,
including a handgun. He said he dropped the gun and a woman's
handbag into the Pines River in Revere.
   The items were later recovered and the gun was identified as the
one used to shoot the Stuarts.
   At a hearing in April, Assistant District Attorney Thomas Mundy
said Matthew Stuart was a potential target of the grand jury
investigation, and indicated Dawley's testimony could shed light on
Matthew's possible role in the case.
   On Friday, prosecutors will argue before the Supreme Judicial
Court that the public interest mandates that Dawley break his
deceased client's confidentiality and tell what he knows.
   ``We are arguing in the interests of justice,'' said Paul Leary,
first assistant district attorney for Suffolk County.
   ``We feel as though there's a compelling interest that if we can
gain whatever additional information Dawley may have, justice will
be served,'' he added.
   Nancy Gertner, a lawyer for Matthew Stuart, called that ``a
completely uphill argument.''
   Goldfarb, the professor, said attorney-client discussions could
be disclosed in some circumstances, for example, if their contents
were revealed to a third party.
   ``But I haven't found any cases where it was argued that the
public interest overrides the privilege,'' she said.
   Goldfarb said courts in most states have ruled that
attorney-client privileges survived the death of a client and went
to the next of kin.
   Gertner said she doubted the value of Dawley's testimony about
his talks with Stuart, even if the privilege was waived.
   ``Charles Stuart was capable of lying to everyone,'' Gertner
said.

<TEXT>
   When 22 members of the Graham-Harris
family assembled to sing happy birthday to the family patriarch,
their celebration site was an unlikely one: a bustling Army post
preparing for possible war.
   There was no choice. Two key family members are part of that
preparation.
   Don Graham and Henry Harris are brothers-in-law who belong to
the 265th Quartermaster Detachment, a South Carolina National Guard
unit getting ready for deployment to the Mideast.
   The water purification unit has been at Fort Stewart, training
hard since Thursday. As a reward, the men got Labor Day afternoon
off. So most of the men's families made the two-hour drive from
their homes around Allendale, S.C., where the unit is based.
   Harris' wife, sister and brothers were there. Graham had the
biggest turnout, a caravan of brothers and sisters, their children
and five of his own seven children. The guest of honor was his
father, Earnest Graham, who turned 83 on Tuesday.
   Don Graham, a 37-year-old construction supervisor, joined the
Guard with his brother-in-law 17 years ago. He accepts his
assignment to the Mideast with little emotion. ``It's something we
got to do,'' he said.
   He said he is proud of his children and wants to see them grow
up. But he said he doesn't spend time worrying about less pleasant
possibilities.
   ``You can't predict life. You could go out the door and get
killed,'' he said. ``Something like this makes you appreciate life
more.''
   Graham and the other unit members couldn't go off post, so they
gave their relatives a limited tour of the military complex: an
extended visit to the PX and lunch at a fast-food franchise.
   The families also got a glimpse of the unit's accommodations, a
long barracks of cinder block and wood built to sleep 40.
   The quarters are kindly described as spartan: no water, dim
overhead bulbs and little ventilation. It bakes during the day and
retains the heat well into the night.
   The men have spread out over the big barracks, taking bunks in
clusters that describe the dynamics of the group.
   Three sergeants occupy the far end and gather most nights to
play guts, an aptly named card game of bluffing and side bets. They
play for quarters now, but back in Allendale they are joined by
other friends each Friday night for games of much bigger stakes.
   ``Sometimes we have 10 people sitting around the table,'' said
Hullie Cohen, a burly contractor.
   The men joke with their wives about going to bed at 8 p.m. They
make tentative plans to see each other again, depending on the
unit's status. What they don't talk about is the Mideast and their
likely deployment.
   The men hardly talk about it among themselves. When they do, it
is usually to joke about the heat.
   Some have suggested landscapers be sent in ahead of the unit to
plant shade trees. Others suggest, just a little more seriously,
that they sell the water they will purify to the Saudis at prices
equivalent to gasoline.
   In conversations, some say they are eager to go. Others wish
they could go back home. There is little mention of political
issues. There is an absence of bravado.
   On their second day of mobilization the unit went to a post
orientation meeting with a larger group of Florida reservists
called up to work at the post hospital.
   As the session was ending, a lieutenant colonel asked the 265th
to stand up. These men, he told the 200 other reservists, were on
their way to the Mideast.
   ``These are your friends and neighbors just up the road,'' he
said. ``This is a great outfit.''
   The rest of the hall burst into applause. The 14 men from
Allendale exchanged grim, nervous glances. Mostly they looked down
at their feet.

<HEAD>Computer Literate Teachers Transforming Classroom Life</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teachers with computer skills are turning their
classrooms into models of education reform, tailoring lessons to
meet students' individual needs in subjects from French to science,
a new study finds.
   The first-of-its-kind survey of 608 computer-savvy teachers in
576 schools across the country found that many have learned ways to
individualize lessons and teach more sophisticated material using
computers.
   The survey, released Monday by the Bank Street College of
Education's Center for Technology in Education, found teachers
using computers in ways that go far beyond the usual
drill-and-practice.
   More than 9 out of 10 said they use word processors for writing
lessons. As many as two-thirds produced ready-made art, and more
than 70 percent used terminals for problem-solving programs,
drill-and-practice lessons, especially in math, or tutorial
programs.
   More than half the social studies teachers surveyed _ 52 percent
_ used computers to construct databases.
   ``I think that it's very clear that what these teachers have
accomplished is exactly the kinds of things people engaged in
reform are trying to accomplish,'' said Karen Sheingold, director
of the center and co-author of the report with Bank Street
researcher Martha Hadley.
   Eighty-eight percent believe their computer knowledge has
transformed classroom life. They have higher expectations of their
students, present more complex material and believe their students
are gaining better thinking skills.
   But teachers also complained of having too few computers,
printers and other hardware, and scarce time to plan and conduct
computer lessons.
   The report recommended that schools rethink their schedules so
that teachers have the time they need.
   Teachers taking part in the mailed survey conducted in the
spring of 1989 taught grades 4 through 12 in all 50 states. They
were identified as knowledgeable about computers by computer and
software companies and education groups.
   Spreading the classroom computer revolution is possible, but
only if there are enough technology, support and time for teachers
to plan lessons, and a school structure in which teachers may
experiment with new technology, the report concluded.
   The Center for Technology in Education operates under a
five-year, $4.9 million grant from the federal Office of
Educational Research and Improvement.

<HEAD>Seven Nations Agree to Work Together to Clean Up Baltic Sea</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Leaders of the seven nations on the
Baltic Sea have agreed to curb the pollution that has killed a
third of life on the sea bed. But the Eastern Europeans say they'll
need Western aid for the effort.
   ``It's a breakthrough for the ecological restoration of the
Baltic Sea,'' said Swedish Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson.
   Carlsson and Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki of Poland hosted
the two-day conference, which ended Monday with agreement that a
comprehensive plan for cleaning up the Baltic would be prepared by
the end of next year.
   Greenpeace International said the conference's declaration was
too vague. The environmental organization has already criticized
the Baltic nations for aiming too low with their 1988 plan to halve
emissions into the Baltic by 1995.
   Sweden and Denmark already have national cleanup strategies, and
the conference was seen as stepping up pressure on the Soviet Union
and former East Bloc countries to catch up.
   Eastern European delegates acknowledged that they have lagged in
pollution control, but made it clear they would need Western money
and expertise to help end environmentally damaging practices.
   ``The policy of earmarking meager financing for conservation
activities in the past is responsible for this state of affairs,''
said Vatsilu Doguzhiev, deputy chairman of the Soviet council of
ministers.
   Ecological problems ``require an enormous amount of effort and
finance,'' he said.
   According to papers presented at the conference, half of all
nitrogen emissions into the Baltic come from Poland. One of the
most serious sources of pollution is the Vistula River, which flows
into the sea.
   Several scientific studies have shown that the Baltic is
suffocating as phosphates and nitrates flood the sea, encouraging
the growth of algae that uses up the oxygen needed by plants and
fish.
   Mazowiecki stressed the need for the cleanup but said his
country's involvement may be unrealistic without significant
technological and financial support from abroad.

<HEAD>Defense Contractors: Gulf Crisis Not Enough To Turn Arms Sales

   Defense contractors at the
Farnborough International Air Show say the military buildup in the
Middle East will do little to reverse the sales decline caused by
the easing of East-West tensions.
   Industry executives meeting at this week's show to socialize and
do business say that despite Iraq's invasion of Kuwait a month ago,
long-term defense orders will continue to decrease.
   Talk of the Persian Gulf crisis fills the blue- and
white-striped tents at Farnborough, 40 miles west of London. And
there are reminders of the confrontation.
   The U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf region has
deprived the show of its expected star attraction, the F-117A
stealth fighter.
   Beneath a display of Exocet missiles, hostesses in
gold-buttoned, red knit suits welcome visitors to the exhibit of
Aerospatiale, the French manufacturer of missiles that are in the
arsenals of both sides in the crisis.
   Patrick Mercillon, spokesman for Aerospatiale's tactical
missiles division, said the crisis had given the defense industry a
psychological boost but the kick has not been felt in sales.
   Worldwide defense expenditures are expected to drop from $1
trillion to $800 billion by 1999, said a defense spokesman for
British Aerospace PLC.
   Boeing Vice President Philip Condit said the Persian Gulf crisis
had made governments more aware of the need for defense flexibility
but it would not mean an about-face on defense spending cuts.
   ``It has given us a broad awareness of the need for military
fitness,'' he said in an interview.
   Ron Howard, chairman of GEC Avionics, sounded more optimistic.
   ``Overall, the situation in the gulf has had the effect of
convincing the world that you cannot walk away from defense
commitments as originally thought because of Warsaw Pact detente,''
Howard said.
   A good outlook for commercial orders is expected to offset
drooping defense orders for firms like Boeing and McDonnell
Douglas, which supply both defense and civilian markets.
   Boeing's Condit said fuel price rises have not forced any
cancellations or delays of this year's expected record production
of 381 commercial planes.
   A $6 billion order from Asiana Airlines, a new South Korean
carrier, was confirmed by Boeing at the air show Monday morning.
   In the afternoon, Airbus Industrie announced a $350 million deal
with the Australian airliner, Ansett.
   Airbus announced its first profitable year since the European
consortium of aircraft manufacturers and engine makers was founded
in 1970.

<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dick Clay, a burly German-Irish Hoosier
with mustache and beer belly, doesn't look much like a Filipino.
But he made a daring escape from Kuwait disguised as one _ with
fake Philippine documents ingeniously forged by a loyal friend.
   Clay, 46, managed to slip across the Iraqi-Jordanian frontier
last week with 34 Filipino employees by pretending he was one of
them. His week-long flight took all the ingenuity of World War II
prisoners' flight from Stalag 17. He had to hide for three days in
the Iraqi capital _ swarming with Saddam Hussein's secret police
and their army of informers _ and tough out a heart-stopping
encounter with Iraqi border guards.
   His one-page travel document was a masterpiece of fakery. A
Filipino instrument technician spent 10 laborious days duplicating
the Philippines Embassy seal and a creating a long inscription in
tiny English characters.
   The stamp was fashioned from a rubber shower sandal; the black
ink was made royal purple by diluting it with milk.
   On paper, the American construction manager Richard Eugene Clay
became Ricardo Erazo. His hometown of Bloomington, Ind., where his
wife Claudia and three children were waiting, became Batangas City
in the Philippines.
   ``I was hiding in Kuwait until the Iraqis said they'd hang
anyone who helped shelter foreigners,'' Clay said in an interview.
``Then I figured it was time to go.''
   That was Aug. 20, almost three weeks after Iraq overran Kuwait.
By then, he was ready.
   Even with his false papers prepared, Clay's appearance posed
problems.
   Filipinos tend to be small and slender, dark-eyed and
dark-haired. But Clay's face is a great red expanse of rugged
terrain, with a prominent sunburned nose and distinctly European
eyes. And he has a large U.S. Navy tattoo on his right hand.
   He pulled a baseball cap down low over his brown hair, wore
large sunglasses and disappeared into a roomy long-sleeved shirt.
That didn't help much, but he had no choice.
   In Kuwait, Clay supervised 500 Filipino and Indian workers at
M.W. Kellogg, a U.S. contractor that maintained two oil refineries
in the emirate. He accounted for all but four and then prepared to
escape himself.
   Food and water were gathered and stashed away. Exit documents
were sought. A route was planned.
   ``When everything else was ready, I told 'em to go out and steal
two buses,'' Clay said. By then, the Filipinos were desperate to
leave the gulf state where some had worked for a decade.
   ``I know of one case where 12 Iraqi soldiers raped a Filipino
lady,'' Clay said. ``They killed her brother when he tried to help
her. That's a fact. She was still in the hospital when I left.''
   Clay left behind $85,000 in the bank and an apartment full of
belongings that he doesn't expect to see again.
   His small convoy made it to Bagdhad after two traffic accidents
and some close shaves on the border. At each roadblock, Filipino
friends stood in the bus door and passed out his papers.
   The group was stuck in Baghdad for three days, which Clay spent
huddling between the others in a car or hiding in three hotel rooms
with 128 others.
   He rented another bus for the equivalent of $5,000 for the
seven-hour drive to the Jordan border. By then, his party had grown
by 25 Filipino women.
   When Clay reached Jordan, he had to spend three days hiding
among dozens of real Filipinos under a makeshift shelter at a
squalid, desperate camp in no man's land camp past the Iraq border
before the Jordanians could process the refugees.
   There, he sent scouts to find a Westerner.
   They found Jim Nuttal of Save the Children, who saved Clay.
   But the tough part was getting out of Iraq. Clay cleared every
hurdle, finally garnering the treasured exit stamp on his false
travel document. Then, at a last check before entering Jordan, an
Iraqi guard stuck his head into the bus.
   He glared at Clay and said: ``Marine?''
   ``Filipino,'' said Clay.
   The Iraqi took him off the bus for six hours of interrogation.
   But his friends rallied around him. They piled their luggage
across the road, insisting that if Clay was returned to Baghdad,
they'd go too.
   They scuffled with Iraqi guards swinging truncheons. Finally,
one woman barged into the border office, wailing that she could not
be separated from her uncle.
   Finally, the stern-faced Iraqi handed back Clay's document and
waved him onward.
   With a trace of a smile, he said: ``Goodbye, Marine.''

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Egyptian soldiers are in Saudi Arabia,
prepared to fight if Iraq invades, but that's a thousand miles from
Cairo and life goes on as usual in the teeming metropolis of the
Middle East.
   This is mango and guava season. Decorated carts haul stacks of
the fruit into the city. Juice sellers, costumed from the pages of
the Arabian Nights, are popular attractions.
   Hawkers clog crowded sidewalks with illegal tables holding
mechanical toys and live tortoises for children, hair bows for
mothers. There are evening carriage rides along the Nile for those
with the money to pay.
   American and European teen-agers, summer vacations over, have
returned to their favorite haunts: Greasy Burger, Pizza Hut and
Roy's Goes Mexican at the Marriott Hotel.
   Nightly television includes ``Knot's Landing'' reruns. Johnny
Weissmuller swings across the screen in ``Tarzan Finds a Son.''
   A recent day's outing to the Suez Canal, past dozens of Egyptian
military installations, produced one unusual sight: a taxi tooling
down the road with a monkey on top. The bases were quiet.
   A canal-side peanut vendor watched the U.S. Navy battleship
Wisconsin and French aircraft carrier Clemenceau steam into the Red
Sea heading for the Persian Gulf. He barely glanced at the rest of
the convoy.
   ``I've seen enough ships,'' he said, ``but the helicopter escort
was great.''
   In Cairo coffeehouses, there is far more talk of how to win
peace than how to wage war.
   ``We all are praying for peace,'' a student said. ``Nobody wants
war.''
   The tension engendered by Iraq's occupation of Kuwait on Aug. 2,
which caused 4,000 Egyptian soldiers and tens of thousands of
Americans to be sent to Saudi Arabia, seems remote from most of
Cairo's 12 million residents.
   Expatriate parents speak of frantic telephone calls from abroad
urging caution.
   An American grandfather demanded that his daughter bring his
grandchildren home. ``They are home,'' she replied.
   Life in Cairo surges onward with the same chaos and madness it
has possessed through the millennium since the city was founded in
969.
   Change comes so often and so swiftly to Cairo that talk of a
possible Persian Gulf war was diluted from the start by more
immediate cares: rising prices for gasoline and food, shortages amd
gigantic sales that brought more jostling people than usual to
downtown Cairo.
   August was hot and steamy. Cairo's air quality was lousy.
   As always, the well-to-do _ including President Hosni Mubarak _
spent the month at the Mediterranean seaside of Egypt's summer
capital, Alexandria. Schools and universities will not open for
several weeks.
   Except for the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, when Egyptians
party all night and sleep until noon, August is the only time Cairo
traffic takes a break.
   This year, however, there appeared to be more fender-benders
than usual. Taxi drivers blamed an influx of drivers from the gulf.
   ``Kuwaitis can't drive in Cairo,'' one said after swerving to
avoid a collision. ``They're not used to so many cars.''
   Kuwaiti families stranded by Iraq's annexation of their country
are moving from hotels to apartments, becoming part of the calliope
that is Cairo. Kuwaiti flags fly from some cars. Others are covered
by photographs of Kuwait's deposed emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed
al-Sabah.
   Tired Egyptian workers returning from Kuwait and Iraq, many now
penniless, head for their villages in jammed taxis. They carry
tattered suitcases instead of the household appliances and
electronic goods they had always been able to bring as gifts.
   Extra security precautions in Cairo are minimal.
   Since the invasion, the government has kept four truckloads of
helmeted riot police near the Iraqi Embassy in Zamalek, a Nile
River island opposite downtown Cairo.
   At first, the trucks stood in relentless sunshine at the
treeless front of the embassy, but wearing riot gear in a covered
truck is uncomfortable business and the vehicles were moved half a
block to the protection of shade trees.
   Officers sit around square tables, drinking tea and reading
newspapers. A single truck is parked outside the Safir Zamalek, a
nearby residential hotel owned by Kuwaitis.
   Security trucks also sit near the embassies of Kuwait and Saudi
Arabia several miles away. Farther south along the Nile, less
fortunate soldiers spend their hours in hot, rickety trucks of
faded blue, halfway between Cairo and the rich suburb of Maadi
where many diplomats and wealthy Egyptians live.
   Outside the downtown offices of Iraq Airways, where long lines
of Egyptian workers once waited, two policemen lean against the
polished white facade.
   Another pair yawn through their watch guarding Kuwait Airways
offices in a suburban shopping arcade.
   To old hands, there's nothing new in all this.
   In 1942, Cairo's cabarets and swinging night life gave no hint
that the decisive battle of EL Alamein was raging 150 miles away.

<HEAD>New Law Allows for Arrest of Those With Overdue Books</HEAD>

   Drop the novel. Step away from the car. You're
under arrest for having an overdue library book.
   Starting on Thursday your overdue books could land you in police
custody. A law signed by Gov. Michael S. Dukakis in June would
allow the arrest of library scofflaws if they have received notice
that their books are 30 days overdue.
   The law also raises the maximum fine for an overdue book from
$50 to $500.
   Although the law makes no mention of a jail sentence for an
overdue book, it allows for up to five years in prison and a fine
of $25,000 for the theft of library property worth more than $250.
   Gregor Trinkaus-Randall, a collection management consultant for
the Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners, said librarians
need tough enforcement tools.
   ``Any library book that is not returned therefore has to be
replaced by the library and is money out of the town's pocket that
could be spent on other materials,'' he said.
   The town of Shrewsbury, for example, loses an estimated $12,000
a year in library materials, Trinkaus-Randall said. ``Books are not
cheap,'' he said. ``I'm not even talking about rare books. An art
book can cost $100 or more.''
   David Linsky, a defense attorney in Cambridge, criticized the
measure.
   ``I think the police are having enough trouble chasing down
murderers and rapists without having to keep up with people who
have overdue library books,'' he said.
   Trinkaus-Randall said he expects librarians will use discretion
in sending police after those with overdue books.
   ``Most libraries will go through more notification of somebody,
giving them the benefit of the doubt,'' he said. ``In most of the
cases, they are not going to say on day 31, send the police out.''
   Linsky complained that the law allows the arrest of library
scofflaws without a warrant, something that can't be done with an
offense such as assault and battery. He said the measure is
``absolutely 100 percent unenforceable.''
   ``If the police are told by an employee of the library that you
have an overdue library book, then the police can arrest you in any
public place and put the handcuffs on you,'' he said. ``That's the
real horror show of this thing.''
   Steven Crawford, a spokesman for Dukakis, said the
administration is taking another look at the law ``to determine
whether the questions that are being raised are accurate.''
   Massachusetts is not the first state to get tough on those who
keep library books at home beyond the due date.
   In Georgia, a woman was jailed overnight when she failed to
appear in court to explain why her books were not returned. The
woman said she was sure she had returned the books, and sued the
county $500,000 last year for being jailed.
   In Florida and South Carolina, police have also been put on
notice to track down those with overdue books.

<HEAD>Black Baptists Weigh Challenge to Gulf Buildup</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The nation's largest black church, which once
censured Martin Luther King Jr. for moving too fast on civil
rights, is weighing the first major religious challenge to the U.S.
troop buildup in the Persian Gulf.
   The 7.8 million-member National Baptist Convention U.S.A. Inc.
is scheduled to consider at its annual meeting a resolution
criticizing the sending of troops.
   ``We are not fighting over any principle or ideal,'' the Rev.
Theodore Judson Jemison, convention president, said at welcoming
ceremonies Monday.``Our fighting ... right now is over oil. It's
unfortunate America would become involved the way it has.''
   The action comes amid criticism that the denomination's new $10
million headquarters in Nashville is too extravagant for a church
that has long been accused of being slow to respond to social
issues. The church still owes $7 million on the headquarters, which
was dedicated last year.
   ``It (the convention) is a sleeping giant that tends to remain
asleep. When it tends to wake up, it is filled with gross
overindulgence'' such as the World Baptist Center, said Kane
Felder, a professor of New Testamament at Howard University
Divinity School.
   The church is the nation's third-largest Protestant denomination
and bills itself as the largest black organization in the world.
   More than 50,000 delegates from the denomination's 32,000
churches are expected to attend the 110th annual meeting, which
runs through Sunday.
   The agenda includes abortion, AIDS, homelessness and teen-age
pregnancy along with the Middle East. It shows the influence of
Jemison, who led one of the nation's first boycotts of segregated
busing in Baton Rouge, La., in 1953.
   Under his predecessor, the late Rev. Joseph H. Jackson, the
convention followed a gradual approach to civil rights, ousting
King from a prominent role in a bitter leadership battle in the
early 1960s.
   Jemison, who sided with Jackson during that fight but then led a
movement that ousted Jackson in 1982, has tried to take a more
aggressive political stance.
   While other major religious groups and churches, including the
National Conference of Catholic Bishops and National Council of
Churches, have been cautious not to criticize the deployment of
troops in Saudi Arabia after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Jemison
questioned the cost and morality of the action.
   ``Think of the good that the billion dollars could do for black
America and poor white America,'' he said.
   Jemison is coming under some similar criticism over the new
World Baptist Center.
   Felder said the expense is a ``travesty'' when the church faces
such problems as drug abuse and teen-age pregnancy. Others defend
the center, the first such headquarters ever built by a black
church organization.
   ``I think it's a good status symbol for our people,'' said the
Rev. Allen Stanley, a convention vice president.
   To some observers, the jury is still out on how well Jemison has
realized King's dreams of turning the institution into a force for
social change.
   ``How well this administration has been able to achieve those
ends is difficult to assess because so much has been invested in
the building of the World Baptist Center,'' said Forrest Harris,
director of the Kelly Miller Institute on the Black Church at
Vanderbilt University.

   Twenty-three years after they were
first used in Vietnam combat, ``hunter-killer'' helicopter tactics
are being updated with the latest in night-flying technology and
interservice cooperation.
   As darkness fell Monday over the desert, a small Army OH-58
Scout helicopter loaded with special gear for night operations
lifted off from an airbase runway.
   Just behind it came two of the Marine Corps' newest AH-1 Cobras,
the ``Whiskey'' model that has twice the power and three times the
lethal punch of its Indochina-era ancestor.
   Earlier in the day, the pilots sat together for a briefing on
the night's two-hour training mission.
   Together, the pilots from the Army's 82nd Airborne Division and
Marine Light Attack Squadron 269 formed a hunter-killer team
designed to destroy enemy tanks before the tanks are aware of their
presence.
   The technique was first developed in Vietnam, where army ``pink
teams,'' combined a Scout helicopter to find enemy bunker complexes
and jungle camps with a Cobra gunship to destroy them with rockets
and machine guns.
   If war with Iraq breaks out, officers said, the technique will
be applied to Baghdad's tank formations in the open desert, where
U.S. forces expect to have a wide edge in night-vision capability
and weaponry.
   ``This is a perfect environment over here . . . We 're working
specifically to fly in that environment, specifically to fly at
night, because that is probably what we're going to be called on to
do,'' said Lt. Col. Kenneth Hill of Tulsa, Okla., commander of the
Marine air unit.
   The Army helicopters are the result of years of effort to
develop an aircraft for special operations in darkness.
   They were first used for night patrol duty during the Persian
Gulf ``Tanker War'' in 1987-88.
   One pilot told then of hovering within easy view of fishing
boats whose occupants were unaware of his presence.
   ``They never look up,'' he said.
   The Cobras sitting on the Saudi flightline are the latest
models, all less than a year old.
   Their engines produce about 3,300 horsepower, twice that of the
Vietnam version. They carry laser-guided Hellfire missiles and
other weapons that were less sophisticated or non-existent in
Indochina days.

<HEAD>Jupiter's Great Red Spot May Lose Some of Its Red</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jupiter's Great Red Spot may soon lose some
of its red because of a change in the weather on the largest planet
in the solar system.
   A 6,200-mile-wide belt of clouds on the planet is starting to
change to its typical dark brown smoggy color, 13{ months after it
turned white, astronomers say. When the belt turns brown, its winds
start feeding ammonia ice crystals into the Great Red Spot, washing
out some of the color.
   The Great Red Spot is a hurricane almost twice the size of
Earth. The cloud belt, or Southern Equatorial Belt, sits just north
of the Great Red Spot.
   Several astronomers from NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility on
Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano and from other observatories around the
world reported the change to the International Astronomical Union's
Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, an astronomy reporting
agency in Cambridge, Mass.
   Scientists study weather on other planets to understand rules
governing weather on all planets, including Earth.
   In July 1989, British astronomer G.M. Hurst first noticed that
the Southern Equatorial Belt was changing from brown to white and
growing colder.
   But during the past two weeks, astronomers observed the cloud
belt starting to turn brown and get warmer, according to telegrams
sent by the Central Bureau on Aug. 22 and on Wednesday.
   The belt changes to white when Jupiter's internal heat pushes
enough ammonia ice crystals upward in the atmosphere, where winds
over 300 mph spread the crystals out to form a white deck of
light-reflecting cirrus clouds.
   The cloud belt changes to brown when violent storms mix
Jupiter's atmospheric gases, allowing sunlight to trigger reactions
by the ammonia and natural gas. That creates brownish smog in the
planet's atmosphere.
   When the cloud belt turns white, the winds diminish, reducing
the amount of ice entering the Great Red Spot and allowing it to
turn darker red.
   The cloud belt faded from brown to white in the early 1970s,
then turned brown again in 1974, remaining that way until 13{
months ago.
   The Great Red Spot faded to dim gray in 1976 but regained its
brick red color after the Southern Equatorial Belt turned white
last year.

   Two weekends of monsoon rains in
Manila and the northern provinces have killed at least 65 people,
destroying roads and flooding the homes of tens of thousands of
people, officials said today.
   Officials said the flooding in the capital, the worst in nearly
two decades, was aggravated by uncollected trash that blocked
drainage canals.
   Emilia Tadeo, a spokeswoman of the Office of Civil Defense, said
30 people died and four others were missing in floods over the
weekend. She said most of about 300,000 people whose homes were
flooded were evacuated from Manila and seven provinces north of the
capital.
   Mrs. Tadeo said 35 people were killed, including 12 children
buried in a landslide, and 27 injured during a heavy downpour a
week earlier. Floods destroyed or damaged the homes of about
250,000 people.
   Two of the latest victims died when tons of garbage crumbled and
destroyed their house at a dumpsite in the slum district of Tondo.
Thirteen others were buried under a landslide in Nueva Vizcaya
province.
   At least 52 villages in the provinces of Pampanga and Tarlac
remained isolated by floodwaters from heavy rains that began
Saturday, Mrs. Tadeo said.
   The army's 51st Engineering Brigade said landslides destroyed an
18-mile section of a highway to Nueva Vizcaya and another 1.8-mile
portion was washed away by floodwaters.
   Five other major northern highways also were blocked by
landslides and a bridge in Tarlac province was washed away by a
river that overflowed its banks.

<HEAD>Advocates Mildly Encouraged by Souter's First Amendment Views</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defenders of First Amendment rights lament the
retirement of Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan but say the
views of his prospective replacement, David H. Souter, on freedom
of speech and the press are somewhat encouraging.
   ``No one could conclude he has an ax to grind against the media
or against First Amendment claims,'' Henry Kaufman of the pro-media
Libel Defense Resource Center said of Souter. ``Arguably, we will
get a fair hearing. But he's no Brennan.''
   Brennan retired in July after a 34-year career as the high
court's leading voice of liberalism. He wrote a 1964 landmark
opinion giving the news media broad protection against libel suits
by public figures and recently authored opinions barring criminal
prosecution of those who burn the American flag in protest.
   The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to begin hearings on
Souter's nomination Sept. 13. Most of what is known of his views
have come from his writings as a New Hampshire state judge.
   President Bush named Souter to the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Boston this year.
   Some who have studied the handful of opinions Souter wrote on
First Amendment issues during his seven years on the New Hampshire
Supreme Court say they are heartened that Bush didn't choose
someone with apparent rigid ideas that could limit free expression.
   ``I think he's been very balanced on free-press issues,'' said
Claudia Haskell of the First Amendment Congress. ``He's in the
mainstream.''
   However, the advocates said they don't expect Souter to be an
ardent defender of free expression if he wins confirmation.
   Kaufman said Souter's opinions seem to reflect more interest
``in the complexity of the law ... than a passion for the
underlying rights at issue.''
   Souter's ``decisions seem to reflect a cautious craftsman whose
views are not expansive in protecting First Amendment rights,''
said Floyd Abrams, a New York lawyer whose clients include the news
media.
   ``There are so many areas of the law in which someone would want
to know Judge Souter's philosophic views that, I think in his case
more than most, the exploration of his general orientation may
indeed tell more than could be learned from particular cases,''
Abrams said. He added that his conclusions could change after
Souter testifies to the Judiciary Committee.
   Some commentators said they were encouraged that Souter had
expressed _ in cases unrelated to the First Amendment _ strong
support for Supreme Court precedent.
   Jane Kirtley, head of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of The
Press, said she was pleased that Souter appears to have little
inclination to topple key rulings.
   ``Let's face it, we've got some good court decisions sitting up
there right now,'' she said. ``I don't see anything that would
suggest (Souter) would be anti-media.''
   Here is a summary of Souter's opinions in some First Amendment
cases as a state Supreme Court judge:
   _Souter wrote for the court in 1985 when it reinstated a police
officer's libel suit against a newspaper that published a letter to
the editor accusing the officer of misconduct.
   Souter said a jury is entitled to decide whether the letter made
factual assertions, or only expressed opinions shielded from libel
attack.
   The ruling, in some respects, seems to have foreshadowed a U.S.
Supreme Court decision this year that has the news media worried.
It said statements of opinion are not automatically immune to libel
suits if arguably they contain factual assertions.
   _In 1984, Souter wrote for the court in upholding a libel
verdict against a newspaper that published an editorial about
``obscene and harassing'' telephone calls. The newspaper was sued
by a man, mentioned in the editorial, who was convicted of making
harassing but not obscene calls.
   While the newspaper had published a separate accurate account of
the case, Souter said the publication was negligent in printing an
editorial referring to obscene phone calls.
   _Souter dissented from the court's 1988 opinion that permitted a
libel suit against Hustler magazine.
   The court allowed an out-of-state resident to take advantage of
a New Hampshire law that a publication may be sued for libel for up
to six years after making a defamatory statement. Most states
allowed only three years to sue.
   Souter said the ruling encouraged the ``evil'' practice of
forum-shopping and said the state had little interest in protecting
the reputation of someone who ``never set foot in New Hampshire
prior to trial.''
   _Writing for the court last year, Souter barred a supporter of
presidential candidate Lyndon LaRouche from attaching a cardboard
sign to a tree and lamppost outside city hall in Manchester, N.H.
But Souter said the man was free to pass out leaflets there without
a permit.
   _While a trial judge in 1981, Souter ruled in favor of two
reporters for the University of New Hampshire student newspaper who
said they were trying to protect their confidential sources. The
judge barred a murder defendant from forcing the reporters to
testify.
   Souter said the defendant's claim that revealing the sources
might point to other suspects in the murder was ``sheer
speculation.''

<HEAD>Perpich Faces Crucial Vote of Confidence in Primary</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Democrat Rudy Perpich says his major
contribution over the last eight years as governor has been to
restore confidence in Minnesota. Next week, Perpich himself faces a
crucial vote of confidence.
   Backers say the 62-year-old incumbent is a visionary leader who
deserves an unprecedented fourth term, while critics call him
``Governor Goofy'' or say he's simply been around too long.
   If voters endorse the latter view in the Sept. 11
Democratic-Farmer-Labor primary, former state Commerce Commissioner
Mike Hatch will be the party's standard-bearer in November.
   The race is a dead heat, according to a recent public opinion
poll, and political observers say it could turn on any last-minute
mistakes by either campaign.
   In the Independent-Republican primary, State Auditor Arne
Carlson holds a 2-1 lead over his closest rival, businessman Jon
Grunseth, the party's endorsed candidate.
   Perpich, who first served as governor in 1977 and 1978 when he
completed the unexpired term of former Gov. Wendell Anderson, says
Minnesota is in far better shape now than it was when he returned
to the office in 1983.
   ``We are without doubt the No. 1 state in the nation,'' Perpich
said during a televised debate with Hatch last week. ``There isn't
a state that's better than we are. In 1983, we couldn't compete
with South Dakota. Today, we're beating the world.''
   Perpich also points to his experience as a plus in the event of
a recession brought on by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   ``We are ready for the oil crisis if it should happen,'' he
said. ``We are prepared to ensure that all Minnesotans will have
fuel to heat their homes, run their businesses and carry on with
their lives. We are also ready if the economy suffers. The state
budget reserve will allow us to maintain programs for the people of
Minnesota. Our strong and diverse economy will protect people's
jobs.''
   Perpich, with a boost from Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's one-day visit to Minnesota in June after the summit,
took his party's endorsement from Hatch, who served as Perpich's
commerce commissioner from 1983 through 1989.
   But the governor's June achievements did not significantly
improve his standing in public opinion polls, which continued to
show his approval rating at a near-record low.
   Perpich's summer was marred by developments involving two
once-close political associates: ex-Midwest Federal Savings and
Loan Chairman Harold Greenwood Jr., who was indicted in connection
with the S&amp;L's demise; and former Greater Minnesota Corp. President
Terry Montgomery, the governor's ex-chief of staff who faces
allegations of sexual harassment and misuse of public funds.
   Hatch, 41, says Perpich has been distracted lately. He cites the
Montgomery and Greenwood affairs and Perpich's disputes with the
news media earlier this year over his lifestyle, which led the
incumbent to propose selling the governor's mansion and giving up
his Lincoln Town Car and driver.
   ``After eight years, past mistakes and personal vanities become
the focus of an administration,'' Hatch said. ``Too many barnacles
attach to the ship of state and it simply won't steer straight.''
   Providing access to affordable health care for all Minnesotans
has been a major focus of Hatch's campaign, and it is the only
issue that has sparked a public dispute between the camps.
   Hatch has called health care policy in the state a scandal, and
Perpich has accused Hatch of distorting his record on the issue.
   The candidates hold similar views on many other issues, with the
major exception being abortion. Perpich describes himself as
anti-abortion and has said he would sign legislation that would
outlaw most abortions in the state. Hatch, who supports legalized
abortion, has pointed out the difference in campaign ads, but
neither campaign has dwelled on the issue.
   Perpich and Hatch each was supported by 46 percent of DFLers
likely to vote in the primary, according to a Star Tribune-KSTP
Minnesota Poll conducted by telephone from Aug. 12-20 among 900
adults. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.3
percentage points.
   In the Independent-Republican race, the Minnesota Poll found
Carlson, 55, with a commanding lead over Grunseth, 44, and former
federal prosecutor Doug Kelley, 43, who once served as Sen. Dave
Durenberger's chief of staff.
   Carlson was supported by 46 percent of Republicans likely to
vote in the primary, while Grunseth had the support of 24 percent
and Kelley of 8 percent.
   Party leaders have come to Grunseth's aid, claiming Carlson is
too liberal for rank-and-file Republicans on the issues of abortion
and gun control.
   Carlson supports legalized abortion and voted for the state's
gun control law as a legislator in the 1970s. Grunseth opposes
abortion and supports a state constitutional amendment guaranteeing
the right to bear arms.

of a peasant self-defense group in the central highlands hours
after fatally slashing the throat of a teen-ager the nearby
provincial capital, police say.
   Police said Ruso Huamani Alarcon, 40, was machine-gunned to
death in a field near his home in Satipo, a rural community about
65 miles northeast of the provincial capital of Huancayo.
   Huamani Alarcon was the founder of a local self-defense peasant
militia that had some 200 members.
   The group was formed five months ago and is one of many peasant
militias organized by the government to combat the Maoist-inspired
Shining Path. The peasants are often armed only with machetes,
pikes and homemade weapons.
   On Sunday night, a band of Shining Path rebels forced
17-year-old Gabriel Jesus Gonzalez Orellana from his Huancayo home,
beat him and slashed his throat, police said.
   His body was found with a sign that read `This is how we
eliminate all criminals who use the party name to rob. Long live
the people's war. Long live the people's committees.''
   Nearly 20,000 people have died in political violence since the
Shining Path took up arms in Ayacucho in 1980.

   Bread, one of the few foods Soviet consumers have
been able to obtain easily, is now in short supply in Moscow for
the first time since the early 1960s.
   Despite a record grain harvest this year, many of Moscow's bread
stores were empty on Monday, and there were long lines at others.
   Some irate consumers blamed President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
economic reforms.
   ``That's perestroika _ we're not moving forward, we're going
backward,'' said Viktor Lyubeznov, a 52-year-old electrician who
went to four Moscow bread stores before finding a loaf.
   ``Now we think freely, we speak freely, but the economic
situation is more severe than ever,'' said Irina Samoruppa, 65.
   Russians have long been accustomed to shortages of fresh
vegetables, fruits and meat. They have no microwave foods, and no
24-hour convenience stores. But heavy Russian bread, baked in
central factories and sold at subsidized prices, has always been
fresh and plentiful.
   The last time people remember long bread lines was under former
Premier Nikita Khrushchev, who was ousted in 1964.
   If the shortage continues, it will be especially hard on
retirees. Some receive pensions of just 30 to 60 rubles ($48 to
$96) a month and survive largely on bread, which costs just 15 to
25 kopecks a kilogram (11 to 18 cents a pound).
   The newspapers Moskovskaya Pravda and Izvestia blamed the
shortage on Moscow's bakeries, which they said were unable to keep
up with the sudden rise in demand when residents returned from
their traditional August vacations.
   Izvestia said the bottleneck was not the harvest, but Moscow's
central bread bakeries, which have changed little since the 1950s,
when the population was about half the current 8.8 million.
   Inside Moscow's Bread Store No. 150, tempers flared Monday as
customers accused saleswomen of saving the last few loaves of white
bread for themselves.
   ``Look, comrades, they have more left back there, they just
won't sell it,'' one woman cried.
   ``You don't know what you're talking about, so just be quiet,''
answered a husky saleswoman in a white apron.
   Outside, along busy Kutuzovsky Prospekt, customers gathered in
clusters to commiserate.
   ``Never in my life have I ever had to search for bread before,''
said Anatoly Znamensky, a 66-year-old retired taxi driver.
``Vegetables, fruit, cheese, butter, meat _ they appear and
disappear. But with bread there was never a problem, until now.''
   The lack of bread comes on the heels of a summer-long shortage
of tobacco that has led to street demonstrations in Moscow and
Leningrad, strikes in other Russian cities and a riot in a Ural
Mountains city.
   In addition, gasoline has become hard to find. Hard cheese has
virtually disappeared from stores in Moscow. And as school
reopened, shelves were bare of the notebooks children are required
to use in class.
   Of all the shortages, however, bread is potentially the most
politically troubling, if only because of its historical symbolism.
   When Lenin returned from exile to lead the revolution in 1917,
he promised Communism would bring ``Peace, Land and Bread.''

   Former dictator Jose Efrain Rios Montt has
lost another round in his campaign to defy a constitutional ban and
run for president.
   The Supreme Electoral Tribunal, a council that is the highest
electoral authority, on Monday rejected Rios Montt's appeal of its
refusal last week to allow him to run in Nov. 11 elections.
   He still can take the case to the Supreme Court and the Court of
Constitutionality. In a non-binding opinion last year, the Supreme
Court said the constitution prohibited him from running.
   The 1986 constitution prohibits from running for president or
vice president anyone who has held power as a result of a coup,
armed revolution or any other action that violated the constitution.
   Rios Montt, a retired army general, held power for about 16
months after a March 1982 military coup. The military ousted him in
an August 1983 coup that installed Gen. Oscar Humberto Mejia
Victores.
   Backed by three conservative political parties, Rios Montt tried
to register as a candidate despite the ban, was refused, and began
the series of appeals. The deadline for registration is Sept. 12.
   Rios Montt presided over an army anti-guerrilla campaign fraught
with human rights abuses and had 15 convicted leftists executed by
firing squad, some of them during a visit by Pope John Paul II.
   He is seen as a law-and-order candidate and his strong showing
in early polls was attributed to the country's increasing crime.
   President Vinicio Cerezo, whose four-year term expires Jan. 14,
cannot run for re-election.

   President Bush is sending two high-level
delegations on a global search for billions of dollars to support
the economic and military campaign against Iraq.
   But given the puny response before the missions even left, some
observers wondered whether getting the allies to contribute money
will prove almost as tough as persuading Iraq's Saddam Hussein to
leave Kuwait.
   To emphasize the importance of the mission, Bush selected two of
his closest Cabinet advisers, Secretary of State James A. Baker III
and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, to head the delegations.
   Brady was leaving today for Paris and meetings with top French
officials in a globe-trotting trip that in four days also will take
him to London, Seoul, South Korea; and Tokyo.
   Baker was expected to leave later this week for a whirlwind tour
of oil-rich Middle Eastern countries, with later stops planned in
West Germany and Italy.
   The administration has a lot riding on the Baker and Brady
plate-passing campaign. Bush hopes to quiet complaints in Congress
that rich allies such as Japan and West Germany, who are more
dependent on Persian Gulf oil than the United States, are not
shouldering their fair share of the burden.
   Even more importantly, the administration hopes the Baker and
Brady trips will provide a dramatic boost to stiffen the resolve of
countries to support the trade embargo against Iraq.
   The administration has not released a figure of how much in
financial support it wants, but published reports have put the
amount at around $25 billion in the first year.
   One proposal reviewed by the National Security Council carried a
$23 billion price tag, with $10 billion earmarked to ease the
financial pain of supporting the embargo for such countries as
Egypt, Turkey and Jordan. The rest of the money would go to support
the U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf region.
   So far, however, the amount of assistance being offered is far
below that level.
   The administration is worried that without a substantial pool of
economic assistance, countries will begin cheating on the trade
embargo, thus jeopardizing the main tool that Bush hopes to use to
force Iraq out of Kuwait.
   The president's effort has raised questions about the propriety
of a global call for donations to support the U.S. military, with
critics charging that it leaves the appearance that American
soldiers are up for hire.
   ``I don't want to leave any impression in the world that we pay
for our soldiers and our sailors if we send them into another part
of the world only through another country's money,'' said Sen.
Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. ``This is not a (for) rent military. It's not
a mercenary force.''
   Leahy said a better approach to take would be to boost taxes if
necessary to pay for the gulf buildup.
   Bush has rejected suggestions that putting pressure on the
allies for money to support the U.S. military was improper, and he
has received support from other members of Congress who said the
allies should be doing more.
   ``The Japanese have a hell of a stake in this and they ought to
pay a hell of a share,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.
   Still, private analysts saw the pledge-seeking missions as a
stark reminder of where America's global fortunes now stand. As the
world's largest debtor nation, the United States lacks the economic
wherewithal to go it alone.
   ``We are no longer the economic superpower we used to be,'' said
Lawrence Chimerine of the Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington
research organization. ``Our changing role in the world economy is
clearly in evidence here.''
   In launching the burden-sharing initiative last week, Bush
maintained that the ``shape of the post-Cold War world'' was at
stake in the gulf crisis. Some analysts agreed.
   C. Fred Bergsten, a former Treasury Department official in the
Carter administration, said Bush's effort could well serve as a
prototype for future global cooperation in which the U.S. military
would stand ready to preserve peace with financial backing from
other countries.
   ``Some Americans are not going to like that because it sounds
like we are mercenaries,'' said Bergsten, who now heads the
Institute for International Economics. ``But the fact is that the
world is an insecure place and we have the military capability to
make a difference.''

<HEAD>Movement of Commodities Said Fairly Normal Despite Mideast Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rail and barge movements of farm commodities
into market channels have been fairly normal this year and should
continue in good shape through this fall's big harvest season, an
Agriculture Department report says.
   The Mideast crisis is driving up oil prices, and analyst T.Q.
Hutchinson of the department's Economic Research Service said that
probably will boost transportation costs in the coming months.
   ``But, because railroads often hold significant inventories of
diesel fuel and obtain fuel under long-term contracts, their costs
are partly shielded from short-term fluctuations in fuel prices,''
he said.
   Rail rates have increased only slightly, reflecting declining
railroad operating costs over the past 12 months, adjusted for
productivity increases, Hutchinson said. For the third quarter of
1990, the Interstate Commerce Commission has projected costs
adjusted for productivity to be down 1 percent from the second
quarter.
   River barge operators will try to pass on higher fuel costs, but
competitive pressures may dampen attempts to raise rates.
   Writing in the September issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine,
Hutchinson said the nation's transportation services are expected
to be adequate for the remainder of the year.
   ``However, projected low water flows from the Missouri River
mean that navigation will be difficult on the Mississippi River
between St. Louis and Memphis this fall,'' he said.
   Streamflow throughout the huge Mississippi and Missouri
watersheds plummeted last year in the aftermath of the 1988 drought
and its lingering effects in the northern Great Plains.
   The Army Corps of Engineers has announced that the Missouri
River will be closed for navigation beginning Nov. 1, the same as
last year.
   That will boost the cost of grain marketing for companies that
usually depend on Missouri, but it will ``not markedly cramp'' the
distribution system's ability to handle demand, Hutchinson said.
   Looking at operations earlier this year, Hutchinson said the
Mississippi River system ``returned to its dominant role in
transporting feed grains for export.''
   In the first six months of 1990, he said, corn accounted for 77
percent of the downstream traffic on the Mississippi, and soybeans
13 percent. May shipments were a 10-year high for the month.
   Mississippi water levels were high in the spring, with March
readings at St. Louis averaging 138 percent above a year earlier
and 13 percent above the month's 44-year average.
   By July, there was a substantial lowering to 18.6 feet, although
the long-term average at St. Louis for July is only 13.4 feet,
Hutchinson said. The July 1989 average reading was 1.7 feet.
   ``Water levels are expected to fall for the remainder of the
year,'' the analyst wrote. ``Even so, towboat captains have become
experienced with low water conditions, and the new Melvin Price
lock and dam complex near Alton, Ill., is expected to greatly
reduce the number and length of backups that characterized the past
two seasons.''
   Hutchinson said that as navigation improved, barge rates to New
Orleans dropped from their peaks last December of $12.15 per ton at
Peoria, Ill., and $7.05 at St. Louis. By March, those averaged
$6.43 from Peoria and $4.92 from St. Louis.
   ``But in April, rates rose sharply in response to a 28 percent
increase in grain volume,'' he said. ``At Peoria, rates advanced 25
percent to $8.06 per ton, and at St. Louis the high was only
slightly less, 23 percent, to $6.04 per ton.''
   Hutchinson said barge rates on the Illinois and Mississippi
waterways declined in May and June and that further reductions
occurred in July, according to preliminary indications.
   Although this year's barge situation has improved, the long-run
prospects for navigation on the Mississippi are less optimistic.
   Hutchinson said that in the 1988 drought year, 60 percent to 80
percent of the total water flow at St. Louis came from the Missouri
River. And between 40 percent and 60 percent of the flow came from
the Missouri River reservoir system in Montana and the Dakotas.
   The figures for 1989 are not yet available, he said, but the
percentages are believed to be about the same as for 1988.
   ``Normally, runoff, chiefly from snowmelt, would add 25 million
acre-feet of water to the reservoirs each year,'' Hutchinson said.
``But from 1987 to 1989, only 12.5 million to 21.3 million were
added annually.''
   The forecast for 1990 was 20.5 million acre-feet of runoff for
the reservoirs, but Hutchinson said the actual runoff apparently
will be somewhat less than that.
   ``The Corps of Engineers estimates that it will take six years
of normal runoff to raise the Missouri River reservoirs to full
capacity,'' he said.
   In June, heavy rains raised the Missouri's level at Kansas City
to nearly 20 feet, up 300 percent from a year earlier. But at Sioux
City, Iowa, levels in June averaged 16.6 feet, down about one foot
from June 1989.
   Hutchinson said the Corps of Engineers decided to terminate the
navigation season on Nov. 1 and reduce the flow of water to about
82 percent of normal, suggesting that water levels will plummet in
November.
   Last November, the river's level at Sioux City averaged 10 feet
at the flood gauge, a six-foot drop from October, he said. It seems
probable that the flow from the Missouri into the Mississippi this
year will be no more _ and probably less _ than in 1989.
   ``Thus, navigation conditions on the Mississippi between St.
Louis and Cairo, Ill., should remain adequate through the summer
but could deteriorate early in the fall,'' Hutchinson said. ``Low
water might be encountered well before the winter freeze.''

   A U.S. aid official is flying to Angola this
week, hoping to win approval for emergency relief for tens of
thousands of people facing starvation because of drought and
warfare.
   The leftist Angolan government has rejected proposals for a
cross-border assistance program because of concern that the
supplies could contain U.S. weapons for anti-communist rebels.
   Andrew Natsios, director of the Office of Foreign Disaster
Assistance, is expected to arrive in the Angolan capital of Luanda
later this week to discuss the issue with government officials. The
office is an arm of the U.S. Agency for International Development.
   Natsios also plans to visit the affected areas, which cover a
broad stretch of territory along in the southern part of the
country and encompasses both government- and rebel-held zones.
   Officials believe the potential for a catastrophic famine
probably is greater in southern Angola than in any other region of
Africa.
   But the Angolan government's hard-line stance reflects a
wariness that the United States, which has been arming the UNITA
rebels since 1986, may use a cross-border relief operation to run
guns to the rebels. The most likely headquarters for a relief
program are neighboring Botswana and Namibia.
   The Bush administration derided Angola's concerns as
``absolutely ridiculous'' and said any such program would be
carried out by a trusted charitable agency, such as the
International Committee of the Red Cross.
   Over the past several weeks, U.S. and United Nations emissaries
have failed to convince Angolan authorities to show more
flexibility.
   The famine area has been afflicted both by drought and by
prolonged fighting that resulted from a government offensive
earlier this year.
   The administration is prepared to be the major contributor if
the Angolan government agrees to an international relief effort,
officials said.
   Angola has been a sore point in East-West relations for years.
While the United States has been supplying the rebels, the Soviet
Union and Cuba have provided generous backing for the government.
Cuba once had 50,000 troops in Angola but has begun a phased
withdrawal that is expected to be completed next year.
   One measure of the mistrust between the Angolan government and
UNITA was the breakdown of peace talks last week in Lisbon,
Portugal.
   The negotiations collapsed after government negotiators refused
a rebel demand for formal political recognition in advance of any
cease-fire agreement.
   ``This inflexible demand was designed intentionally to scuttle
cease-fire negotiations,'' said Manuel Pedro Pacavira, Angola's
U.N. ambassador.
   Angolan authorities contend that the rebels sabotaged the talks
in order to win congressional approval for additional U.S. military
aid.
   UNITA President Jonas Savimbi said he was surprised and
disappointed that Angolan officials were not prepared to sign an
agreement that would bring ``peace and democracy'' to Angola.
   ``As this was the purpose of this round of talks, their behavior
raises doubts about the sincerity of their intentions,'' Savimbi
said.

   The prosecutor around here spends
weekdays putting people in jail and weekends behind bars himself.
The sheriff, meanwhile, has lost his license for driving drunk.
   Law enforcement has become personal for the top cops in Wyoming
County, situated in the coal country of southwestern West Virginia.
   In Pineville, the county seat that is home to 1,100 of the
county's 36,000 residents, nearly everyone knows everyone else, so
the legal woes of Prosecutor Paul ``Butch'' Goode and Sheriff Jim
Bolt keep tongues wagging.
   ``My gut feeling is that most people don't like what they
hear,'' court clerk Jack Lambert said, calling the situation an
embarrassment.
   At the Pineville Restaurant across from the courthouse, owner
Bill Adams disagreed.
   ``I've known the Bolt family for years. His father was sheriff.
His father was chief of police. Him and his brother were raised
here. They're good people,'' Adams said.
   ``Butch Goode _ he was raised within 100 yards of my house. I
want to emphasize none of these people are crooks and I still have
respect for both of them.''
   Goode in May was placed on five years' probation and ordered to
serve 12 weekends in jail after he was convicted on federal charges
of failing to file tax returns promptly. The charges, for 1982-85,
were misdemeanors.
   Bolt was convicted in state court in June of driving under the
influence of alcohol, another misdemeanor. His license was revoked.
He faces sentencing Sept. 24.
   Under state law, misdemeanor convictions do not disqualify
public officials from holding office. Bolt and Goode were elected
and their terms run through 1992.
   Goode serves weekends in the Taylor County Jail about 200 miles
to the north. He also must pay $49,949 in back taxes and a $10,000
fine. A state Bar Association review that could result in his
disbarment is in its early stages.
   Goode, 52, did not return a call for comment. He said previously
that prosecutors singled him out because of his office, not because
of the severity of his crimes.
   Bolt, 37, was arrested in Beckley after he was spotted driving
erratically in 1988. A test showed his blood-alcohol level at 0.18
percent, nearly twice the legal limit of 0.10 percent.
   At his trial, he contended that an intestinal disorder caused
him to burp, producing a false reading from a Breathalyzer. He said
he hasn't decided whether to appeal.
   Sitting in his office, Bolt pointed out that he was elected in
1988, after his arrest, and said that he is tired of the attention
it has attracted.
   ``From the press you'd think this was Watergate,'' he said.
   Bolt can regain his license after he completes a driver training
course but he said the lack of a license hasn't hampered his
ability to do his job, which includes tax collection.
   ``Most of my work is done right here in the office or in the
treasurer's office,'' he said. ``If I need to go out on patrol,
I'll ride with one of the deputies.''
   He said that people who supported him before the arrest continue
to support him, but that opponents are quick to conclude, ``He
ought to have his toes cut off and be hung up by his thumbs.''

   U.S. strategists look down every day on
Iraq and Kuwait from a squadron of satellites that can spot tank
tracks in the desert, listen in on Iraqi military commanders and
give B-52 bombers pinpoint accuracy.
   The round-the-clock data relayed by at least 12 reconnaissance,
electronic intelligence, early-warning, meteorological and
navigation satellites orbiting high above the Persian Gulf could be
decisive if the shooting starts in the confrontation with Saddam
Hussein.
   ``It gives the Americans an astonishing technological edge over
the Iraqis, who must find it disconcerting to know they're being
watched 24 hours a day like that,'' said Don Kerr of London's
International Institute for Strategic Studies.
   There is at least one electronic intelligence satellite,
probably a shuttle-deployed Magnum, that can intercept telephone
and radio communications in Iraq and Kuwait, including those from
Saddam Hussein's headquarters to his field commanders and on down
to inter-unit contacts.
   Analysts estimate that several smaller White Cloud electronic
intelligence, or ELINT, satellites put into orbit by Titan
missiles, are being used over Iraq and Kuwait.
   Their signals are relayed through ground stations to Britain's
top-secret General Communications Headquarters in Cheltenham,
southwest England, known as the ``Puzzle Palace,'' which is linked
to the U.S. National Security Agency in Maryland.
   ``The capabilities are enormous,'' Kerr said in a telephone
interview.
   As well as satellites, the Americans have access to data
garnered by British and Israeli electronic surveillance operations
in the Middle East.
   The British have sophisticated signals intelligence, or SIGINT,
facilities on Cyprus in the eastern Mediterranean that intercept
radio and telephone traffic around the Middle East. They funnel
data back to Cheltenham headquarters for relay to the National
Security Agency.
   All this winds up at the U.S. military headquarters now
established in Saudi Arabia to provide an hour-by-hour intelligence
picture for Gen. Norman Schwartzkopf, commander of the
ever-expanding U.S. military force confronting Saddam's legions.
   Polar-orbiting ``Keyhole'' KH-11 high-resolution,
optical-imaging reconnaissance satellites gave the Americans the
first evidence of Iraqi military moves toward Kuwait in late July,
several days before the Aug. 2 invasion.
   Kerr said there is at least one KH-11 photo satellite orbiting
as low as 180 miles over the northern Persian Gulf region. It makes
several passes a day. A second satellite, believed to be a more
advanced KH-12, is also reported to be in operation.
   These satellites carry 12-foot-long cameras with enormous focal
length that Kerr said can take photos ``that provide great detail
... they can count tanks, tents and even people on the ground.''
   The images are processed and stored on board as digital signals
that are relayed to ground stations in the Pacific and Greenland
for relay to Washington.
   ``The military satellite situation isn't as good as it might
have been,'' Kerr said. ``One KH-12 launched by the space shuttle
last year broke up in orbit.''
   The Americans have a Lacrosse radar-imaging satellite at an
altitude of 495 miles, launched by a space shuttle in December
1988. Its radar can produce data in all weather, although its image
resolution is not as good as that of the optical-imaging systems.
   There are believed to be at least six communications satellites
operating in support of U.S. forces in the region that give
Schwarzkopf direct links to the Pentagon and the White House.
   ``Units in the field can talk to the Pentagon if they need to,''
Kerr noted. ``And these links are extremely difficult to jam.''
   There are Navstar navigational satellites in 12,400-mile-high
orbits that are used by U.S. warships to provide pinpoint
positioning.
   Kerr noted that, providing troops have equipment to hook into
these systems, ``they're perfect for travelling across the desert,
where navigation is difficult because of the lack of topographical
features.''
   The high-flying B-52 bombers based on the Indian Ocean island of
Diego Garcia, 2,100 miles east of the crisis zone, could be
equipped with Navstar links.
   That would in theory allow them to dump their 30-ton bombloads
with great accuracy, although they were used in the Vietnam War to
carpet-bomb targets.
   Kerr said Navstar could give B-52 navigators the capability to
``know their position to within 10 meters (33 feet) ... a great
asset in `blind bombing,' which is probably a misnomer now.''
   The Americans also have several early-warning satellites that
can detect missile launches. Analysts say at least one or two of
these systems, in geostationary orbit, are being used to keep watch
on Iraq's missile batteries.
   All these satellites produce a flood of photos and data around
the clock that has to be processed before it can be useful.
   Kerr noted that the workload for U.S. analysts in Washington
``must be enormous. They must be working flat out to sift through
this data and analyze it to get as close to real-time intelligence
as they can.

   The Children's Defense Fund says lax day-care
laws in too many states amount to an inexcusable failure to protect
the health and safety of the nation's youngsters.
   A report issued Monday by the private organization urged support
for legislation pending in Congress that would provide $1.75
billion in federal funds for child care, require states to develop
minimum requirements, expand tax credits for low-income working
families, and guarantee parents the right to make unannounced
visits.
   The fund said its national survey of child-care centers and
day-care homes found that 13 states fail to require that children
in day care be immunized against childhood diseases and 22 states
do not require periodic fire drills.
   Thirty states do not insist that children 18 months and older in
licensed child-care centers receive vaccine to protect them from
meningitis, and 24 states fail to require such centers to have
energy-absorbing surfaces as a safety feature beneath swings,
slides and structures on which children climb.
   The report said four states _ Connecticut, Idaho, Indiana and
South Carolina _ failed to require that even one of those standards
be met.
   It said 19 states allow child-care centers to operate with five
or more infants per adult, although experts cited by the fund say
one person should care for no more than three or four.
   Thirteen states, it said, allow one person to care for five or
more infants or toddlers in family day care.
   Georgia and North Carolina permit one person in a child-care
center to care for up to seven infants, while South Carolina allows
eight and Idaho sets the limit at 12, the report said.
   Thirty-three states allow one person to care for more than 10
4-year-olds. The limit is 18 in Georgia and 20 in Alabama, Florida,
North Carolina, South Carolina and Texas, the fund said.
   The report said more than 6 million children, including more
than 2 million who are younger than 3, spend part or all of their
day in out-of-home child care.
   About half of those children are cared for by people providing
family day care in their own homes.
   Most of those children are cared for in homes serving less than
six youngsters, the report said. However, it said 22 states exempt
family day-care homes from regulation, including inspections, if
they care for five or fewer unrelated youngsters.
   Twenty-nine states fully or partially exempt child-care programs
operated by public schools from regulation. Although about
one-third of child-care centers are operated by religious
institutions, 13 states fully or partially exempt such programs
from licensing.
   In 29 states, parents do not have the unqualified right to visit
their child's family day-care home unannounced, the report said.
   That denies parents ``the most meaningful opportunity to detect
potential threats to their child's health and safety, or to monitor
the quality of care their child receives,'' the fund said.
   Thirty-five states do not require any type of training for staff
in family day-care homes, and 32 do not require specific levels of
formal training for teachers in child-care centers, the fund said.
   It said only three states _ Kentucky, Minnesota and Wisconsin _
require specific levels of pre-service and in-service training for
child-care teachers and family day home providers and specify the
level of training that providers must receive in each area.

   Eleven-year-old Michael Guadiello Jr., who
uses a wheelchair because of muscular dystrophy, calls a collie
named Ashley his ``independence dog'' and wants it to help at
school.
   Administrators say no canines on campus.
   Michael has little use of his arms and legs. Ashley is a service
dog trained to help with things like opening doors, carrying
packages and retrieving dropped objects.
   The boy had attended special education classes at a school in
the Rose Tree Media School District, where the dog was barred by
administrators after Michael obtained it in April.
   District lawyer John Steuerwald said officials objected because
Michael's ``educational program did not call for a dog'' and
because there were no provisions for the animal's care. The
district has no other student with a dog.
   Complicating the fight to get Ashley admitted to the classroom
was a decision by school officials that Michael should be
``mainstreamed,'' or attend class with non-disabled students in his
home district of Chichester.
   The Guadiello family opposes that move. The boy's parents say he
needs the special education resources available only at Rose Tree.
In addition, the Chichester school is not equipped for wheelchair
users.
   On Friday, the state Department of Education issued a temporary
ruling ordering Michael's mainstreaming into Chichester's middle
school. Class begins Wednesday.
   State officials said the school must provide access to the
building through such items as wheelchair ramps and offer trained
people to help Michael twice a day in using the bathroom.
   Michael said he was ``disgusted'' that officials think they can
put his physical needs on a schedule. He said his ``independence
dog'' is all he needs.
   The boy's father and his wife, Jane, say the decision illegally
discriminates against their son. They say that if he were blind,
the school would not have barred a guide dog.
   The family is fighting the dog ban on another level because
state law prohibits discriminating against handicapped people who
use guide or service animals, and specifically outlaws it in public
schools, said the Guadiellos' lawyer, Kyle Burch.
   The Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission has tried to settle
the dispute. The case brought before it is pending and wasn't
affected by the state schools ruling, which stands until a hearing
Sept. 10.
   Ashley was trained for almost 19 months at a cost of $7,229,
according to Jean King of Independence Dogs of Chadds Ford, which
then sells the dogs for $150 to handicapped people like Michael.
   Mrs. Guadiello said she was disappointed with the state schools
ruling and would check Chichester's compliance with the order
before allowing Michael to attend.
   The collie frees Michael from relying on friends and family
members for help, his mother said. It is as necessary as Michael's
wheelchair and is not a pet, she said. That role is shared by the
family terrier and a cat.
   ``I slept on the floor of Michael's room for 10 years because he
was afraid he wouldn't be able to get out on his own if there was a
fire,'' said Mrs. Guadiello, as Ashley rescued a dropped pencil for
her son. ``But with Ashley here, I'm back in my own room.''

<HEAD>Study Says Fed Dominated by White Men</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study commissioned by the chairman of the
House Banking Committee found that the Federal Reserve has only a
handful of women or minorities serving in top policy-making jobs.
   Despite a 1977 law requiring diversity of membership and public
participation on the Fed boards, consumers, labor unions, small
business executives and farmers have little representation,
according to the committee staff report ordered by Rep. Henry B.
Gonzales, D-Texas.
   Two-thirds of the board of directors for each of the 12 regional
Fed banks are elected by commercial banks in each area that belongs
to the Fed system.
   There are only three women among the 72 directors of regional
Fed banks selected by commercial bankers in each region and all but
two of the 72 are white, the House survey reported. There is one
black and one Asian American.
   There are no representatives of consumer groups or labor
organizations among the 72 bank-elected directors. Seventy-seven
percent of those directors are either current or former commercial
bankers, the report said.
   The other one-third of the directors are appointed by the
seven-member Federal Reserve Board.
   The report said the Fed, whose members are appointed by the
president, has a disappointing record on the question of diversity.
Current Fed Governor Martha Seger is only the second woman to serve
on the Fed board and there are no minorities.
   The 36 regional board members appointed by the Fed board are
still heavily drawn from the ranks of white males with connections
to banking or big business, the report said.
   Seventy-seven percent of the Fed board's appointments are white
and 83 percent are male. Half the Fed's appointments are former
bankers, while none comes from consumer organizations or labor
unions, the study said.
   ``Most of the Federal Reserve directors are drawn from the ranks
of big business and banking,'' Gonzalez said in a statement. ``You
have to question whether people working in the highfalutin world of
high finance and business can really understand the impact higher
interest rates have on the average workers' purchasing power and
job security.''
   Federal Reserve spokesman Bob Moore said officials at the
central bank had not received the House report and would have no
comment until they had a chance to review it.
   Gonzalez, D-Texas, has been a longtime critic of the Federal
Reserve, but his elevation to committee chairman last year has
given him a powerful forum from which to direct his attack.
   The Fed's 12 regional banks are in Boston; New York;
Philadelphia; Cleveland; Richmond, Va.; Atlanta; Chicago; St.
Louis; Minneapolis; Kansas City; Dallas and San Francisco.

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraqis hardened by eight years of war with
Iran seem almost casual about the formidable buildup of U.S.
firepower across the border in Saudi Arabia.
   There is some concern about the embargo on trade with Iraq
ordered by the United Nations after Baghdad seized Kuwait, and some
suspicions about the causes of the crisis.
   But there is no smell of war along the noisy, bustling avenues
of this ancient capital.
   Instead, Iraqis willing to talk with Western reporters view the
threat of war with a mixture of bravado and Arab fatalism.
   ``What can I do about it?'' shrugged Mahdi Kathom, a 30-year-old
vegetable vendor in central Baghdad. ``If it happens, it is because
God lets it happen. There is nothing to do about it.''
   ``God willing, our president will solve this,'' said one
middle-aged woman who declined to give her name. ``Saddam Hussein
is a strong and wise man.''
   Many Iraqis question the motives of President Bush in sending
troops and warplanes to Saudi Arabia. But a few, speaking privately
in this rigidly controlled society, say they are suspicious about
their own leader and his reasons for provoking the crisis.
   Some say Saddam underestimated the U.S. reaction and a few
others voice suspicions that he triggered the crisis partly to
challenge the Americans and raise his standing in the Arab world.
   For eight years, Saddam told his people they were fighting Iran
for control over the Shatt al-Arab waterway that spills into the
northern Persian Gulf.
   Then, on Aug. 12, just 10 days after the invasion of Kuwait,
Saddam acknowledged Iran's claim to shared sovereignty over the
waterway that some Iraqis believe they bought with the blood of
their loved ones.
   Saddam's peace overture secured his vulnerable eastern border,
freeing troops to confront the U.S. buildup.
   Some Iraqis say they now wonder why Saddam gave in on the
waterway and why he chose to invade Kuwait.
   But while a few quietly mumble their suspicions, Iraqis who
spoke openly defended the invasion and occupation of the country
they have long considered a part of Iraq, wrongfully separated from
the motherland by British colonial rulers.
   ``Forget Kuwait, it is a dream. There is no Kuwait,'' said one
Baghdad taxi driver.
   A few Iraqis said they have heard frightening assessments of
American military might on foreign radio broadcasts by the British
Broadcasting Corp. and Voice of America.
   But the state-controlled press has focused on dissent in the
West against the sanctions and the troop buildup. The Iraqi press
also has disparaged the ability of U.S. troops to fight against
battle-hardened Iraqis in the desert.
   Near the center of Baghdad stands the Monument of Saddam's
Qaddissiya Martyrs, a tribute to the dead of the Iran-Iraq war,
named after Babylon's victory over the Persians in 600 B.C.
   The marble monument covered with aqua tiles is in the form of
two halves of an Islamic dome. It is split to symbolize the Islamic
tradition that the dome of the mosque opens to allow martyrs to
ascend to heaven.
   It is one of the many military monuments in Baghdad. Another is
made from the wreckage of an Iranian war plane shot down over the
city.
   Madria Nasser Abdul Al-Mishadani, a 40-year-old woman walking
near the Qaddissiya monument, said Iraqi women are not afraid their
loved ones will be killed in another war.
   ``The women are not afraid. Aren't we Iraqis? Why should we be
scared?'' she asked.
   ``Why is the United States so upset over the invasion of
Kuwait?''
   ``The United States had less right to go into Panama than we had
to go into Kuwait,'' she added. ``We have tried to get Kuwait back
for 30 years.''
   A man walking near the monument, 40-year-old Salem Kalaf, said
that during the war with Iran people got used to hardships such as
the reduced consumption that the U.N. trade embargo might bring
again.
   ``We know about war. We saw missiles hit our homes and our
stores. And we lived through that,'' he said.
   The government indicated it will start rationing the sale of
some basic foods in the next few days. But it insisted the measure
was a precaution because of the sanctions and not a response to
shortages.
   Some lines have already formed outside bakeries for bread. But
while some say privately they are worried about shortages, most
Iraqis like Kalaf say publicly they are prepared to endure more
hardships.
   ``I am not afraid. Our country is strong and we can handle
this,'' said Mohammed Hussein, a 47-year-old Baghdad resident, who
said two of his sons were with the army in Kuwait.
   ``I want to tell the American people that their president is not
listening to us. We want peace,'' said Ahmed Abdallah, a
54-year-old Baghdad resident.
   ``It appears that most people do not want a war with Iraq. If
America is a democratic country, then Bush should listen to what
the people are saying.''

   Men join the student body at tiny
Colby-Sawyer College today for the first time in more than 60 years.
   Marches, sit-ins and the seizure of an administration building
by protesters ensued after trustees voted 22-1 in April 1989 to
open the school to men.
   But a mood of acceptance prevailed as students arrived for the
start of the fall semester at the 525-student college, with many
women welcoming their 79 new male classmates.
   Maria Francesconi, a junior nursing major from Cheshire, Mass.,
said she accepts the change, although she demonstrated against it
last year.
   ``We all had the summer to adjust,'' she said. ``There's a lot
less anger here and a lot more excitement now.''
   Freshman Dean Heide of Ringoes, N.J., said he's comfortable at
his new school.
   ``My biggest fear was that we wouldn't be wanted,'' he said.
``But after talking to the girls, I'm not worried.''
   Colby-Sawyer President Peggy Stock said money worries made the
change necessary.
   ``Looking 10 years down the road at the number of women we would
be able to draw from, we said, `We're in trouble.' '' Stock said.
``It was an emotional decision, but it was the right decision for
us.''
   Colby-Sawyer, which admitted men from 1837 to 1928, plans to
have equal numbers of men and women by 1995. Twenty-nine percent of
this year's 240 freshmen are men, and 12 of 40 transfers are male.
   The school had a 120 percent increase in applicants last year
and fund-raising also is up, Stock said.
   Most alumni and students have accepted the change, she said. She
added that 91 percent of students scheduled to return did so, and
few left solely because of coeducation.
   Other schools in similar situations haven't had it so easy.
   At 1,200-student Wheaton College in Norton, Mass., which became
coeducational in 1988, some alumni took the school to court to get
back their donations. They said they wouldn't have donated if they
had known the school planned to admit men. They won, and 56 shared
a $127,300 refund.
   Last year at Mills College in East Oakland, Calif., students
crippled the school with protests and boycotts after trustees voted
to admit men as undergraduates. Two weeks later the trustees backed
down.
   Some men said they chose Colby-Sawyer because of its size,
academic reputation and picturesque campus about 40 miles from
Concord, a short drive from ski areas, lakes and mountains.
   Dan Hancock of Lancaster said he also wanted to be part of
history.
   ``I wanted to be able to look back in 20 years and know I was
part of this, that I helped build it,'' he said.

   Iraq has poured its citizens into
Kuwait to try to intimidate local residents and may settle
thousands in the captive nation, Kuwaiti government ministers say.
   The ministers said Monday that Iraq is continuing to pillage
their country but added that civil disobedience and some armed
resistance has succeeded in making the Iraqi army uneasy about
taking over certain areas.
   Planning Minister Suleiman al-Muttawa claimed Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein has bought whatever support he has in the Arab world.
   The minister accused Saddam of paying billions of dollars to
regional leaders, including Yasser Arafat of the Palestine
Liberation Organization and Jordan's King Hussein, to take his side.
   The comments came as the Cabinet of the Kuwaiti
government-in-exile prepared for a series of meetings with top
Western officials over the Persian Gulf crisis.
   British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd was expected in this
southwestern mountain resort today and is to meet Secretary of
State James A. Baker III for talks on Friday.
   Al-Muttawa said Baker would meet with Kuwait's emir, Sheik Jaber
Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, whose government-in-exile set up headquarters in
this city after Iraq overran Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The minister said the agenda for the talks was not fixed, but he
expected it to center on the multibillion-dollar bill for deploying
the massive U.S. force in the region.
   The Bush administration has indicated it expects contributions
from West Germany, Japan and the wealthy oil states of the Persian
Gulf.
   Al-Muttawa said Kuwait would make whatever military efforts it
could, but added that its most successful means of combating the
Iraqis was a civil disobedience campaign.
   ``The passive resistance is very effective,'' he said. ``There
is no cooperation by the Kuwaiti citizens with the invading forces,
which is annoying the Iraqis because they thought their soldiers
would be welcomed.''
   Al-Muttawa said a Latin American-style guerrilla movement was
not possible in his country because it has no back country to
shelter a large guerrilla force and no real military tradition.
   ``This is a flat country where anybody who walks along can be
picked up miles away,'' he said.
   But armed attacks have been useful in dissuading Iraqis from
entering residential neighborhoods out of fear they would be shot,
he said.
   The planning minister said Iraq was trying to move some of its
citizens into residential areas as part of a psychological warfare
campaign to convince Kuwaitis that their country is part of Iraq.
   He said he doubted Iraqi families would want to move into such a
hostile environment.
   Housing Minister Yahia Fahd said there was some concern that
Saddam would eventually move hundreds of thousands of Iraqis into
the country, effectively outnumbering the Kuwaiti population.
   The ministers said 240,000 Kuwaitis had fled to neighboring gulf
countries and that tens of thousands more were in other Middle
Eastern countries, Europe and North America at the time of the
invasion.
   The total number of Kuwaitis is put at about 600,000, but
foreign workers brought the country's population up to 1.7 million.
   Fahd said Saddam's plan was to hold a referendum after
large-scale Iraqi resettlement in Kuwait and then claim the Kuwaiti
people wanted to be annexed to Iraq, a move decreed Aug. 6.
   Information Minister Sheik Jaber Mubarak Al-Sabah said the
Iraqis in the past few days had dismantled television broadcast
facilities, traffic lights and even street lights and carted them
off to Iraq.
   Al-Muttawa said the government had no estimate of the value of
goods stolen from Kuwait.

   Mark Tucker's tee shot on the
dogleg par 4 third hole plopped down right where he wanted it _ in
the sand.
   The next shot was a tough one _ there was little room behind the
green and a shot too long would land out of bounds.
   But Tucker again was near perfect, dropping the ball just to the
left of the green _ in the sand.
   Welcome to golf desert style, where every shot _ or at least
every good shot _ lands in the sand.
   Even the greens _ the locals call them browns _ are sand, packed
hard by rollers and made into a clay-like substance by spraying
them with the area's most abundant substance next to sand _ oil. A
sign at the first hole warns golfers, ``No Spikes Shoes Allowed On
Greens.''
   You can't play this course with clubs and balls alone. Every
player carries a small square of plastic grass, placing it under
the ball after every shot to provide a not-so-lush green surface to
hit off.
   Tucker played a round of golf Monday with a reporter who had
spotted the course while flying over it in a helicopter. Most golf
courses are tucked into the woods or alongside a lake; this one is
between a huge military airbase and rows of oil storage tanks.
   The ``Rolling Hills Country Club'' is one of the many recreation
facilities offered to employees of Saudi Aramco, the huge oil
company in the northeast Saudi desert.
   ``It is something else, isn't it,'' Tucker said during a
nine-hole round Monday. The complex has 27 holes, split between the
East, West and South courses. These course were built in the 1970s
but there has been golf at Aramco since not long after the company
was established 50 years ago.
   There's a driving range, too, and a club where golfers, much
like their counterparts back in the states, can grab a burger and
beer after a round. Here, however, the beer is the non-alcoholic.
   Tucker, asked to compare desert golf to the game back home,
misses the beer more than the grass.
   ``It's more fun to drive around in the cart with beer'' says the
Michigan native, an Aramco land surveyor who now owns a place in
Montana he visits for about a month each year.
   The wind on the Aramco course is fierce; drives that begin
straight can get carried 20 yards or more off target. And in a game
in which concentration is said to be the key to success, a
screaming F-15 takeoff at the airbase down the hill can be more
than a bit unnerving.
   ``You get used to it,'' said Tucker.
   About the only elements of this golf course that recall other
courses of the world are the sandtraps. But even they are a bit
different.
   When Tucker dropped a shot into a trap short of the green he
didn't reach for a wedge. The sandtraps here are circled with
asphalt, providing a hardenend, ramp-like lip. So Tucker used his
putter, slapping the ball into the slope and up onto the green.
   The shot was unconventional, but effective.
   ``That's one of our only in Dhahran shots,'' Tucker said with a
grin. ``They take practice.''

   Share prices declined sharply on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange Tuesday, while the dollar was moderately higher against
the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 512.79
points, or 2.02 percent, closing at 24,907.64 points. The index
shed 557.94 points Monday.
   The dollar closed at 144.05 yen, up 0.50 yen from Monday's
finish. It opened at 143.80 yen and ranged between 143.73 yen and
144.20 yen.
   Currency dealers said there was little movement on the exchange
market in the absence of major market-affecting news.
   ``But as a whole the dollar is being bought back, especially
against European currencies,'' said Masakazu Kimura, a dealer with
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank. Kimura said the trading between the dollar
and the European currencies also affected the dollar-yen rate.
   On the stock market, local news reports that the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry would grant oil companies'
requests to raise prices because of the Persian Gulf crisis drove
share prices down, traders said.
   But trade minister Kabun Muto told a morning news conference
that his ministry will reconsider the decision.
   ``The market generally remained sagging, due partly to a decline
in stock price index futures,'' said a Nomura Securities dealer who

   Other dealers said the index's slide was promoted on small-lot

wait-and-see position over uncertainties about the Mideast
situation.

<HEAD>New Zealand Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer Resigns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Less than two months before
national elections, Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer resigned today
after polls indicated the governing Labor Party would be routed
with him at its helm.
   Labor chose External Relations and Trade Minister Mike Moore to
head the government and tackle the daunting task of turning around
the party before the Oct. 27 balloting. Palmer took office 13
months ago after defeating Moore in a party vote to replace David
Lange as prime minister.
   The latest polls show the opposition National Party with a
2-to-1 or more lead over Labor, although many voters say they have
not made up their minds.
   Under Labor leadership since 1984, New Zealand has undergone a
wide-ranging economic transformation, with many state-owned
businesses being sold off.
   But the electorate is unhappy with the ailing economy: inflation
is at 7.6 percent, short-term interest rates at nearly 15 percent
and unemployment has reached 7.3 percent.
   Moore, 41, who in recent months repeatedly denied he would seek
to unseat Palmer, told a news conference that New Zealanders wanted
a ``new direction'' and that his bid for the leadership ``in no way
is a reflection on Mr. Palmer's service to New Zealand.''
   Palmer, 48, had denied he would step down as recently as Monday.
New Zealand Press Association quoted sources as saying he had
support to stay on but that he quit because infighting would have
devastated the embattled party.
   Palmer told reporters he ``may well have had the numbers to
remain, but I took the view that to have a leadership contest on a
vote would be destructive, it would be divisive, that it was not in
the best interests of the collective.''
   ``The need for a feeling of unity is paramount at this time, and
that feeling of unity will have been restored by my decision,'' he
said.
   Asked if he thought Moore had a greater chance of winning the
election, he said: ``I certainly hope that he has.''
   Palmer apparently will leave politics altogether. He said he
would not seek re-election to Parliament, although he agreed to
stay on as environment minister, a non-Cabinet position, through
the election.
   National Party leader Jim Bolger said it was ``quite
irrelevant'' who was prime minister going into the election.
   Many Labor candidates, concerned about Palmer's dwindling
popularity hurting their chances for election, have been been
running campaign ads without the Labor logo.
   A Radio New Zealand poll in late July showed the conservative
Nationals leading by a 46 percent to 21 percent margin over Labor.
   However, polls have shown Moore leading all candidates for prime
minister and he was the clear choice in a survey of business chief
executives.
   Some political commentators say Labor is in serious danger of
losing 20 of the 56 seats it holds in the 97-seat Parliament.
   The Nationals hold 40 seats in Parliament and the breakaway
left-wing New Labor Party has one. The 5-month-old Green Party has
been running third in opinion polls.
   But many voters remained undecided, including many traditional
Labor supporters. Opinion polls in some areas have put the
undecided vote at 38 percent to 47 percent.
   Labor took power in 1984, ousting the Nationals. It won
re-election in 1987 despite losing some support because of its
deregulation policies.
   Palmer defeated Moore for the prime minister's job after Lange
resigned in August 1989 for health reasons. He had undergone heart
surgery the year before.
   Lange's leadership had also been under challenge because of
party wrangling over the pace and direction of the former Finance
Minister Roger Douglas' program of deregulating the economy.
   Lange had been one of New Zealand's most popular leaders,
particularly earning admiration for his no-nuclear stance in
refusing to allow U.S. warships to dock in New Zealand because they
would not confirm or deny whether they were carrying nuclear
weapons.
   Both Palmer and Moore represent districts in Christchurch, the
largest city on New Zealand's South Island.
   Moore became the youngest person ever elected to Parliament when
he won his first seat in 1972 at age 23. He was ousted in 1975 in
Labor's landslide loss, but returned three years later.

   Hundreds of blacks protesting alleged
discrimination blocked a highway into this casino city and
threatened to disrupt Saturday's Miss America Pageant. Twenty-three
people were arrested.
   The demonstration Monday on the Atlantic City Expressway delayed
thousands of Labor Day travelers on one of the city's busiest days.
   In meetings with Mayor Jim Whelan last week, the activists had
demanded more recreational sites and an end to alleged police
brutality. Talks broke off Friday.
   Among those arrested were the New York City activist the Rev. Al
Sharpton and Steve Young, who said they represent The Forgotten
Youth of Atlantic City.
   They promised to shut down the pageant for the first time since
it began on the Boardwalk in 1921.
   ``They might as well close it down,'' said Young, who with
Sharpton was charged with inciting to riot.
   Pageant director Leonard Horn said, ``We intend to proceed as
scheduled with all of the events that we have been planning for the
past year.'' He cited past protests against the pageant by
feminists and striking NBC technicians.
   The week's events include preliminary contests, a Boardwalk
parade Friday and live televised finals Saturday night.
   The march began in a rundown section a few blocks from the
casinos. Chanting to the rap anthem ``Fight The Power,'' the group
weaved through the city's ghettos, gathering up supporters in two
housing projects.
   The roughly 250 marchers reached the expressway, where they
blocked traffic.
   Police donned riot gear and shields when eggs and at least one
bottle were thrown from a housing project.
   The crowd marched to the police station, where those arrested
were being processed on charges including disorderly conduct and
aggravated assault.
   At least 200 demonstrators waited for two hours for Sharpton's
release as police blocked the entrance.

<HEAD>Ruling Party Promises Citizens Role in Candidate Selection</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governing party, which has run Mexico for
60 years, has pledged polticial reforms ranging from recognition of
churches to citizen participation in the selection of party
candidates.
   ``We have achieved a new democracy,'' Institutional
Revolutionary Party president Luis Donaldo Colosio said at a
closing speech Monday before 9,000 delegates to the party's
three-day 14th National Assembly.
   The party, known as PRI, has dominated Mexican politics since it
was founded in 1929. Its presidential candidates have traditionally
been chosen by their predecessors, and only in the past two
elections has there been any public discussion on the matter.
   The government has also refused to legally recognize churches,
which may not own land; clergymnen may not vote. Still,
anti-clerical laws are widely ignored in this intensely Catholic
country and the government has twice played host to Pope John Paul
II.
   In one resolution, the party called for ``separation of
religious and political affairs'' and equal treatment of all
``public manifestations of religion.''
   But the most important reforms adopted by the assembly dealt
with change in the selection of candidates at all levels, giving
control over the process to local party organizations. The reforms
did not, however, spell out how citizens would participate in
candidate selection.
   The democratic reforms had strong backing from President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari, who has described such political changes as an
essential part of his program to modernize the Mexican economy and
political system.
   Colosio told delegates that the party must adapt to a changing
Mexican society and confront the threat of electoral losses.
   ``From now on, any militant that wants to be a candidate will
have to face first the judgement of his fellow citizens,'' Colosio
told delegates.
   In 1988, Salinas won with just over 50 percent of the vote, the
smallest margin in party history, and the party suffered its first
Senate losses. Leftist parties gained ground in the central part of
the country, defeating Salinas in the Federal District and a few
states.
   In 1989, the party lost its first governor's race, conceding
victory to the conservative National Action Party in Baja
California.
   The party is preparing for crucial city elections in the state
of Mexico, which includes most of the Mexico City suburbs. It is
also readying itself for 1991 mid-term congressional elections.
   In another resolution, membership in the all-powerful Central
Committee was cut from 37 to nine, and the influence of party
peasant and labor organizations in the committee was reduced.
   The PRI also appealed to private businessmen to join in the
country's efforts at modernization.
   ``The Mexican entrepreneur,'' the party said, ``must be
innovative, take chances and work together with other sectors of
society.''
   Another reform that brought applause from delegates was a
recommendation that ``political trials be instituted for corrupt
government officials.''
   Outgoing government officials with reputations for corruption
have traditionally been exempted from legal action. In the last two
administrations, however, several officials have been jailed, the
highest of them being the director of the government oil monopoly.
   Salinas told the delegates he was ``proud to be a member of the
new'' party.
   ``The reforms are not to satisfy our enemies but to create a
better society,'' Salinas said. ``Their purpose is to maintain the
Mexican Revolution in power; they are changes to win votes
democratically; they are changes for victory, not to give away
power.''

<TEXT>
   Continuing pessimism over the Middle East situation
pushed prices sharply lower on the Tokyo Stock Exchange today,
while the dollar gained against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which fell
557.94 points Monday, shed another 512.79 points, or 2.20 percent,
closing at 24,907.64.
   A light 330 million shares changed hands on the first section,
down from the previous day's 360 million shares.
   Many institutional investors were waiting to see how the Middle
East situation would develop, securities dealers said.
   A series of arbitrage selling, in which traders seek to profit
from price gaps between the spot and futures markets, helped
accelerate losses in the afternoon, they said.
   In addition to news reports that crude oil producers would raise
prices for Japanese importers, a rumor that fighting between Iraq
and U.S.-led multinational forces might flare up within two weeks
``boosted concern'' among investors, said Sachiko Hata, a dealer
with Nikko Securities.
   ``It is a difficult market now,'' Ms. Hata said.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 144.05 yen, up 0.50
yen from Monday's finish. After opening at 143.80 yen, it ranged
between 143.73 yen and 144.20 yen.
   ``The dollar was bought back, mostly for technical reasons, in
reaction to yesterday's selling,'' said Masaya Ueno, a dealer with
Fuji Bank.
   Ueno said there were no specific incentives affecting the
exchange market.
   On the bond market, the yield of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bond edged up to 8.130 percent late today from
Monday's close of 8.105 percent. The price slipped to 82.96 points
from 83.07.
   Meanwhile, North Sea Brent crude oil for October delivery was
valued at $29.00 a barrel in Tokyo this afternoon, almost unchanged
from its closing in London Monday.

<HEAD>Eight Charged in Subway Slaying of Utah Man Who Tried to Aid
Mother</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight teen-agers accused of stealing to get
night club admission money were charged in the subway slaying of a
Utah tourist who came to the aid of his mother when she was punched
in the face, police said.
   Five were picked up for questioning at the Roseland Ballroom
after the fatal attack Sunday night, Capt. Steve Davis said. The
other three were arrested Monday.
   Killed was Brian Watkins, 22, of Provo, Utah. The former college
tennis player was in town with his family for the U.S. Open
tournament. He was stabbed once in the chest after intervening when
his mother was punched.
   He collapsed on the subway platform at 53rd Street and Seventh
Avenue after starting to chase the fleeing thieves, Davis said.
   ``Brian jumped in to help me when one of the muggers hit me in
the face,'' Karen Watkins said. She was treated for a mouth cut.
   The slaying reinforced New York's image as a hotbed of urban
crime. It was the 18th killing in the city's subways this year. In
Watkins' hometown, one homicide was recorded for all of 1989, Provo
police records secretary Bobbie Ferguson said.
   The Watkins family, tennis fans who have visited New York for
the past five years to see the U.S. Open, had spent Sunday at the
tournament and were on their way to dinner when they were attacked.
   Their hotel is near the subway station where Watkins was stabbed
and the Central Park restaurant they were headed for is located
just two subway stops away.
   Watkins was waiting for a northbound train with his father,
Sherwin, his mother, his brother Todd and Todd's wife Michelle,
when a group of young men approached, one carrying a knife, another
wielding a box cutter.
   Sherwin Watkins' pants were slashed and thieves took a money
clip containing about $200 and some credit cards. One punched Mrs.
Watkins in the face.
   The brothers interceded and one of the men stabbed Watkins,
police said. He died later at a nearby hospital. Watkins' father
was treated for a leg cut.
   The dance club is less than a block from the subway station
where Watkins was stabbed. Davis said ``most kids who get off at
that stop are going to Roseland,'' and that it was ``logical'' to
investigate there.
   Debbie Jaspering, a family friend, said she'd seen the Watkins
family at the tennis tournament several days ago, before she
returned to Provo.
   ``They were having a great time,'' Jaspering said. ``They were
sitting with the family of Brad Pearce,'' a touring pro from Provo
who lost in the first round of the Open.
   ``My sister and I had been nervous, you know, two women alone in
the city,'' she said. ``And this happens to the Watkins, with three
men there. It's crazy.''
   Manhattan detective Chief Joseph DeMartino said police recovered
several weapons, including a cardboard cutter and a folding
``butterfly knife'' believed to be the weapon used to kill Watkins.
   The motive of the crime was to get money for admission into the
night club, DeMartino said.
   Arrested was Yull Garry Morales, 18, of Queens, who police said
stabbed Watkins.
   Also arrested and booked for investigation of murder and robbery
were: Johnnie Hincaipe, Anthony Andersen, Louis Fernando Montiero,
Ricardo Lopez, Emiliano Fernandez, all of Queens; Pascual
Carpenter, of Long Island and Ricardo Nova, address unknown. All
are 18.

   Several smaller Persian Gulf states are
shedding a traditional reluctance for close military links with the
United States and allowing U.S. combat airplanes on their bases,
Pentagon sources say.
   ``It's very important to the United States that our aircraft be
able to operate out of these nations in the Persian Gulf,'' one
source said Monday.
   This source said Defense Secretary Dick Cheney was able to
negotiate ``a variety of agreements'' with the nations on the
Arabian Peninsula during his trip there last month.
   Asked to comment on the report during an appearance on ABC's
``Good Morning America,'' Cheney said today he would not go
``country-by-country'' in detailing which ones have accepted what
U.S. forces, but said all ``are participating to one degree or
another. ... The exact degree varies.''
   Cheney said some of the countries are sensitive about
acknowledging the presence of U.S. forces, but said it was fair to
say ``there is more cooperation than there has ever been before.''
   Asked whether the presence of U.S. forces amounts to an implicit
commitment to also defend those countries, Cheney said, ``I think
it does.''
   Because of the threat posed by Iraqi forces because of Saddam
Hussein's invasion of Kuwait a month ago, Saudi Arabia, the United
Arab Emirates and Qatar have allowed U.S. warplanes to operate on
their soil.
   Cheney was able to extend those relationships to include other
Persian Gulf states, such as Bahrain and Oman, as well, said the
sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The sources did not
have specifics on their aircraft deployment.
   Some nations have allowed for refueling rights, others have
allowed for the stationing of aircraft and others have allowed
cargo operations.
   Bahrain has agreed to accept Marine FA-18 attack planes, A-6
attack aircraft, AV-8 Harrier jets and EA-6 electronic jamming
planes, The New York Times reported in today's editions.
   In addition, the United States deployed a ``sizeable number'' of
F-16 fighters in the United Arab Emirates, the newspaper reported.
Also, the United States has F-15E ground attack planes based in
Oman, the Times reported.
   The United States already has acknowledged stationing a squadron
of F-16C fighter planes in Qatar.
   Cheney reached the agreement with Saudi Arabia to allow for the
stationing of U.S. troops on Saudi soil in a meeting with King Fahd
just days after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. He returned to the
Persian Gulf two weeks after the invasion to help fortify Arab
support against Iraq in discussions with the leaders of Bahrain,
Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
   Those countries warmed toward military cooperation with the
United States during the eight-year war between Iran and Iraq, when
U.S. warships protected Kuwaiti tankers from Iranian attack in the
Persian Gulf.

   An annual Labor Day pigeon shoot involving
birds released from cages was ``American as apple pie,'' one
advocate said, but dozens of animal-rights activists didn't agree
and clashed with shooters.
   Three state troopers suffered minor injuries and 25 people were
arrested during the 57th Annual Fred Coleman Memorial Shoot at
Hegins, 40 miles northeast of Harrisburg.
   Several fistfights broke out, a skunk was thrown at protesters
and a demonstrator kicked out the windshield of a car.
   Animal-rights activists from Pennsylvania, California, Maryland,
Kansas, Illinois, New Jersey, West Virginia, Virginia, Texas and
Florida picketed the all-day community fund-raiser, billed as the
largest live pigeon shoot in the world.
   Competitors using shotguns stood about 20 yards from the birds,
which were released one at a time from cages.
   After a group of birds was shot, a group of young ``trapper
boys'' ran onto the field to retrieve them. Some birds were only
wounded and the children would wring their necks or pull their
heads off. Dead birds were collected to be used in fertilizer,
shooters said.
   An estimated 4,800 birds were killed Monday, organizers said.
   ``This is as American as apple pie and Chevrolet,'' said one
burly man, wearing a Jack Daniels baseball cap. ``There's a lot
more worse things than this. Go to Saudi Arabia and protest the oil
prices.''
   ``It's deplorable that these men get their kicks out of this,''
said Paula Murphy, an elementary school teacher from Ashland.
   Fourteen animal activists with fake blood dripping from their
mouths charged onto the field at different times attempting to free
the caged birds. Spectators chanted ``shoot'' as state police tried
to handcuff the demonstrators.
   The people who rushed the field were charged with criminal
trespass. An additional 11 demonstrators were charged with
disorderly conduct.
   State police spokesman Tom Lyon said police ordered the
protesters to leave because ``It was just getting out of control.''
The event has a history of drawing protests and Lyon said 40
officers were assigned and a state police helicopter was called in
as an ``extra show of force.''
   Community members jeered, shouted obscenities and homosexual
slurs at the demonstrators. They said the activists should leave
them alone because the shoot is legal.
   Shooter Jack Keating said the shoot is simply ``killing rats
with wings.''
   Protesters carried signs that read ``Small Men, Big Guns,''
``Stop the Slaughter,'' and ``Killing for Fun is Sick.''
   Community members retaliated with T-shirts and pickets of their
own _ ``Kill them all. Let God Sort Them Out,'' and ``Let Feathers
Fly and Freedom Ring.'
   Seventh-grader Tim Leese wore a T-shirt that said: ``Save a
Pigeon. Kill a Protester.''

   New Kids on the Block member Donnie Wahlberg
scuffled with a fellow airline passenger over a seat, and he could
face charges.
   The 20-year-old pop singer fought with Benjamin Dattner of New
York on a Delta Air Lines flight after it left Salt Lake City on
Sunday, police and Delta said.
   The scuffle was ``very short-lived, and it was not necessary for
us to land the plane,'' said Delta spokesman William Berry.
   Dattner was treated for minor injuries at a hospital and
initially declined to file charges, authorities said.
   But later, in an interview with The Boston Globe, Dattner
indicated he planned to file charges.
   ``Nobody, no matter how famous, should be above the law. This
guy was an animal,'' Dattner said in a telephone interview from his
Manhattan home.
   Wahlberg, who had been sitting in the first-class section, had
gone to visit with members of his entourage in coach. He left
briefly, then returned and found the seat he had been occupying was
taken by Dattner, police said.
   A fight broke out in which Wahlberg poked the passenger in the
eye and the passenger kicked Wahlberg in the abdomen, police said.
   Calls to Wahlberg's agent went unanswered Monday and this
morning.
   It was the second Atlanta incident involving the pop group in
less than a month. On Aug. 9, a bodyguard for New Kids singer
Jordan Knight was arrested after an altercation at a nightclub.

<HEAD>Yeltsin Proposes Drastic Reduction of Kremlin Power Over Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian republic,
has come up with a plan that would give the republics control of
their economies and drastically reduce the power of the national
government.
   ``Russia gives the impulse for change to the entire country,''
Yeltsin told his legislature Monday. ``The center can no longer
ignore this and discard everything done by us.''
   If approved by the Russian republic's legislature, the proposal
would dramatically constrict the power of President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, Yeltsin's rival. Gorbachev's national government would
control only a fraction of the planned transition from communism to
a market economy.
   Yeltsin set an ambitious schedule calling for five days of
debate in the Russian legislature and a vote on the fundamental
reform Sept. 11. That agenda would leave the national legislature
in the dust because it does not open its session until Sept. 10.
   According to a copy of the 250-page plan obtained by The
Associated Press, most decisions regarding the economy would be
made by the 15 sovereign republics.
   Under it, Russia would legalize private ownership of land and
give away huge numbers of state-owned apartments and residential
lots to try to solve critical shortages of food and housing.
   Since Russia contains half of the Soviet Union's people and
three-quarters of its land mass, the national legislature would be
unable to ignore a decision by Russia to embark on a more radical
reform than favored by Gorbachev.
   But Yeltsin said Gorbachev is increasingly willing to understand
the republic's proposals and act together. A joint
Gorbachev-Yeltsin economic commission was scheduled to meet today
to try to forge a single plan that could be adopted by both the
Russian and Soviet parliaments, Yeltsin said.
   So far, Gorbachev has favored combining parts of the Russian
proposal with a purely economic program suggested by Soviet Prime
Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov.
   Pravda said today that Gorbachev has appointed Soviet Deputy
Prime Minister Lev Voronin to head a task force to deal with the
most urgent economic emergencies. The faltering Soviet economy is
plagued by shortages of everything from cigarettes to gasoline.
   Under Yeltsin's plan, the Soviet government's duties would
eventually be limited to such matters as defense, strengthening the
nearly worthless ruble and providing disaster relief. It would lose
the power to tax and would have to rely on dues from the republics.
   Yeltsin said his program has the support of the other Soviet
republics, since it would give them vast new powers. His plan is
dubbed ``500 days'' for the time it provides to switch to a market
economy. It calls for immediate action on reforms that Gorbachev's
government has only mentioned, or postponed years into the future.
   ``People will be given the opportunity to participate actively
in the economy, to buy bakeries, laundries, stores, repair shops
and other things that the future state should not bother with,''
said Russian Prime Minister Ivan Silaev in introducing the plan to
the legislature.
   Before the end of the year, the sell-off of such state-owned
businesses would begin, the plan said. Apartments and residential
lots would be given away or sold for merely symbolic prices.
   Laws that punish entrepreneurs would be eliminated, the proposal
said. Currently, it is illegal to make a profit selling an item
manufactured by someone else's labor.

   About 600 anti-logging activists
confronted 100 counterdemonstrators, but authorities reported no
violence and no arrests.
   The protest Monday was the final one of Redwood Summer, a series
of demonstrations by environmentalists who oppose clear cutting and
logging of old-growth timber.
   Logging companies urged their employees and others who back
timber interests to ignore the protesters as they marched to a
Pacific Lumber Co. mill.
   But as the demonstrators sang, hoisted banners and chanted, a
pro-timber crowd shouted derision of environmentalists and the
group Earth First!
   ``Earth First! go home,'' they yelled. ``Jobs First!'' ``The
'60s are over!''
   Although some of the demonstrators hollered back, most sat in
the roadway, singing anthems such as ``We Shall Overcome'' and
``This Land is Your Land.'' Helmeted police officers stood shoulder
to shoulder between the two groups.

<HEAD>Pope Preaches Against Witchcraft in Africa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By REID G. MILLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MWANZA, Tanzania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II today urged Africa's
Roman Catholics to abandon the ``unspeakable crime'' of witchcraft,
a practice that threatens the church's foundations on the continent.
   In his homily at an outdoor Mass on the shores of Lake Victoria,
the pope also spoke out against abortion, saying the ``dignity of
every human person from the moment of conception until natural
death'' must be respected.
   His sermon came on the fourth day of his seventh visit to
Africa, a vast continent with a declining economy and a soaring
birth rate that is expected to double its population of 500 million
within 20 years.
   Tanzania's average per capita annual income is only about $200,
making it one of the world's poorest countries. Few of sub-Saharan
Africa's 48 other nations fare much better.
   The pope also condemned artificial birth control, calling it
``contrary to the `truth' of married love by which husband and wife
become cooperators with god in giving life.''
   Concerned about their birth rates and their lack of resources to
adequately care for swelling populations, Tanzania and many other
African nations actively support birth control programs.
   John Paul said respect for human dignity also is threatened in
Africa by the practice of uchawi, or witchcraft. He said it leads
practioners into ``forms of enslavement and false worship.''
   He also criticized the traditional African custom of mahari, or
a dowry payment by a husband to the family of his bride. In the
past, these payments usually took the form of cattle, sheep and
goats. Increasingly, they involve substantial cash payments.
   The pope said there are many ``authentic and praiseworthy human
values'' associated with the dowry tradition. But he asked: ``Do
not excesses and abuses of these customs lead to attitudes which
judge the dignity and worth of persons only on the basis of wealth
and possessions?''
   The Roman Catholic Church in Africa, only a century old, faces
the problem of incorporating traditional practices in the liturgy
without overwhelming the faith's traditions and beliefs.
   The church has gone a long way in recent years in the process of
``Africanization,'' adopting the use of tribal drums, native dance
music and language in the liturgy.
   The pope has encouraged the process while warning that the basic
tenents of Catholic faith and teaching cannot be compromised. He
has stressed the church's laws on polygamy, superstition and
priestly celebacy on his current visit.
   An estimated 50,000 faithful attended the Mass on a hillside
above Mwanza, a relatively prosperous cotton-growing and
gold-mining center on the southern shores of the world's third
largest lake.
   Nineteen married couples repeated their marriage vows before the
pope. He also gave First Communion to a group of children dressed
in white finery.
   As he neared the halfway point of his 10-day trip, the pope
ended the day in Moshi, a farming and resort city on the southern
slopes of snow-capped Mount Kilimanjaro, at 18,864 feet the tallest
mountain in Africa.
   His pilgrimage will take him to tiny Burundi on Wednesday, then
on to neighboring and equally small Rwanda.
   He ends his visit on Sept. 10 in the West African nation of
Ivory Coast, where he will consecrate a massive $133 million
basilica.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prime ministers of North and South
Korea met today and prepared for historic talks intended to ease
four decades of military and political tensions. Both expressed
hopes for a new era in their relations.
   It is the highest-level contact between the rivals since the
division of the Korean peninsula in 1945, although the prime
ministers hold largely ceremonial posts and their roles in
policy-making are limited.
   ``People expect to reap much from the talks,'' South Korean
President Roh Tae-woo said today. ``But the task of national
unification should take a step-by-step approach, just like eating a
bowl of rice one spoonful at a time.''
   The visit got off to a bit of a bumpy start. Students in Seoul
staged an anti-government demonstration, and the North Korean
leader's motorcade was involved in an accident immediately after
crossing the border. He was not hurt.
   Also, the North Koreans had barely arrived when they asked to
speak to South Korean dissidents and to visit the families of two
clergymen and a student jailed for illegally traveling to the North.
   The Seoul government has taken a firm stand against allowing its
citizens to talk directly with North Korean officials, and it
brushed aside the request.
   ``They should concentrate on the talks,'' said South Korean
Unification Minister Hong Sung-chul.
   At a gala banquet on the eve of the talks, however, all was
cordial.
   ``I am so glad that you have taken the challenge of blazing an
unbeaten trail through the thicket to come here,'' South Korean
Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon told his North Korean counterpart,
Yon Hyong Muk.
   ``If only we build confidence in each other by meeting again and
again, we should be able to generate sufficient heat to thaw the
thick ice of distrust,'' said Kang, a soldier-turned-diplomat born
in the North who fled to the South before the 1950-53 Korean War.
   Yon, a Soviet-educated technocrat, said: ``After crossing the
border for the first time, I realize it's easy.''
   The North Korean was warmly greeted in the lobby of the hotel
where talks were to be held. ``Welcome,'' shouted several hundred
onlookers outside the hotel. Some waved and applauded.
   As the premier's motorcade approached the hotel, two students
managed to unfold a banner within view, but were quickly shoved
aside by police. Eight radical students were arrested trying to
take a unification banner to the border, police said.
   Another 200 radical students staged a violent anti-government
clash with combat clad riot police at Seoul's Korea University.
   ``Down with Roh Tae-woo,'' students yelled, hurling firebombs
during a two-hour fight. Police fired volleys of tear gas to drive
students inside the campus. Witnesses said the students appeared to
avoid chants which might be offensive toward North Korea. No
injuries were immediately reported.
   The North Korean leader escaped injury shortly after he crossed
the border when the car in which he was riding was involved in a
collision with three other cars on the way to the hotel.
   The accident occured when a civilian car tried to cut through
the motorcade as it drove through downtown Seoul. Two North Korean
diplomats riding in separate cars were treated for minor injuries.
One car caught fire and the windshield on the third was broken.
   The meeting marks the first time both sides recognize the
legitimacy of each other's governments, South Korean officials say.
Previously, North Korea had refused to recognize the Seoul
government.
   Most South Koreans, however, reacted coolly to the talks. South
Koreans have been disappointed by repeated failures of the Korean
governments to make progress in such encounters.
   The North Korean delegation included the prime minister, six
other official delegates to the talks, 33 aides and 50 North Korean
reporters. All wore lapel badges with pictures of North Korean
dictator Kim Il Sung.
   They smiled and waved as they walked across the border at the
truce village of Panmunjom, the first group to cross since 1985 and
only the third delegation since the end of World War II.
   Young women in colorful long traditional dresses bowed and
children presented flowers.
   If all goes well, a second round of talks is to be held in North
Korea's capital of Pyongyang in mid-October.
   The border between the Koreas remains the most heavily fortified
in the world, with more than 1.5 million armed men on either side.
There is no travel, mail or other communication between civilians
of the two sides.

<HEAD>Poll Finds Many Would Consider Leaving Massachusetts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly half the residents of Massachusetts would
consider moving out of the state if the economy got worse, a poll
indicates.
   Of 436 voters polled Aug. 26 to 30 by telephone, 50 percent said
they would not consider leaving if the economy worsens; 47 percent
said they would, and 3 percent said they did not know.
   One-third of those polled for The Boston Globe and WBZ-TV of
Boston said they are cutting back on groceries because of the
economy, and 30 percent said they worry about losing their jobs.
   There appeared to be a connection between job-loss fear and
consideration of leaving the state.
   Most of those worried about losing their jobs were young, 18 to
39, and middle-income _ $30,000 to $60,000 a year, and young and
middle-income residents were chief among those saying they would
consider moving.
   The poll also found that 61 percent thought the economy would
get worse during the next six months, while 15 percent thought it
would improve, and 42 percent blamed state policy makers for the
state of the economy compared with 24 percent who blamed the
downturn on the national economy.
   The poll was conducted by KRC Communications Research, which
said it had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 5
percentage points.

   The Customs Service detained a Kuwaiti
container ship and was examining the cargo to see if anything was
destined for Iraq, officials said today.
   The ship Al Wattyah was ordered held Monday evening, said Neil
Pitagno, a Customs agent based in Newark.
   ``The vessel has not been seized, it has been detained,'' said
Pitagno. ``There are a number of containers aboard that we are
interested in.''
   He said containers were being checked ``to see if there is any
material aboard that is going to Iraq that we want to stop.''
   He said the crew cooperated with Customs agents who boarded the
vessel, but said some containers might have to be unloaded to
determine their contents.
   ``It will take a while. It is a time-consuming process,'' said
Pitagno.
   The ship's destination was not yet known, he said.
   The vessel's last port of call was Cadiz, Spain, said Sgt.
Charles O'Neill of the Port Newark police.
   ``My understanding is that they are treating it as an Iraqi ship
due to the annexation of Kuwait by Iraq,'' he said.
   The ship is owned by United Arab Shipping Co., according to
Lloyd's Register of Shipping.

<TEXT>
   Arab League Secretary-General Chedli Klibi
has quit, highlighting a split within the organization over the
Persian Gulf crisis. League officials said today a Lebanese will
act as interim secretary-general.
   Klibi, 66, a Tunisian, announced his surprise resignation as
head of the 21-member body late Monday. He had held the job for 11
years.
   Assaad el-Assaad, a Lebanese and the 70-year-old doyen of the
Arab League's deputy chiefs, will act as interim secretary-general,
the officials said. The new secretary-general must be chosen by a
two-thirds vote among league members.
   Klibi's resignation highlights divisions within the Arab League
over the gulf crisis as well as the group's decision to move the
league headquarters from Tunis back to Cairo, its original seat.
   Klibi had been the Arab League's secretary general since 1979,
when the organization moved to Tunis. He was reappointed to the
post in March for another five-year term.
   The league has been openly divided since its Aug. 10 Arab summit
in Cairo over the Persian Gulf crisis, which was precipitated by
Iraq's Aug. 2 seizure of Kuwait.
   The summit condemned Iraq and agreed to send a token Arab force
to bolster American troops defending Saudi Arabia from any move by
Iraq to seize more territory.
   Tunisia boycotted the summit, provoking anger from Egypt and
Saudi Arabia, the most vocal Arab nations in their opposition to
the Iraqi invasion.
   While more than half the league members took what was viewed as
a pro-Western stance, others sided in varying degrees with Iraq.
   It was Klibi's job to reconcile the two camps. But at a meeting
of Arab League foreign ministers last week, Saudi minister Prince
Saud al-Faisal was sharply critical of the secretary-general.
   In addition, Klibi has been caught in a battle over the location
of the League's headquarters, which was moved to Tunis after Egypt
declared peace with Israel in 1979 and was barred from the League.
   The decision to move the headquarters back to the Egyptian
capital has provoked protests from Iraq. Iraqi Foreign Minister
Tariq Aziz criticized the move because of what he called Egypt's
``partial attitude'' against Iraq.
   Some have charged that Klibi himself has resisted the move to
Cairo.
   A meeting of Arab League ministers has been called for Sept. 10
in Cairo, where the transfer of the League's headquarters back to
Cairo will be officially announced.

<HEAD>Study Finds One in Four Households hit by Violent or Property
Crime</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About one in four U.S. households was hit by a
violent or property crime last year, a slight increase from the
previous few years but still substantially lower than the rate
during the 1970s.
   ``During the last five years, the percentage of households
victimized by crime has remained level at about 25 percent,'' said
Steven Dillingham, director of the Justice Department's Bureau of
Justice Statistics.
   ``In 1975, when this statistical series commenced, about one in
three households was struck by crime,'' he said.
   The bureau's figures come from the National Crime Survey, which
annually interviews members of 49,000 households nationwide to
determine crimes against household members who are at least 12
years old. The NCS does not check for murder, because it compiles
its information from surveys of victims.
   The portion of households that suffered from a violent or
property crime ranged from 32 percent in 1975 to 30 percent at the
start of the 1980s and gradually tapered off to a low of 24.5
percent in 1987, according to the report.
   The actual percentage of households that suffered a violent or
property crime last year was 24.9 percent, up slightly from 24.6
percent in 1988, according to the report released Sunday. The
figures include attempted as well as completed crimes.
   A total of 23.5 million households was victimized by one of the
crimes checked: rape, assault, robbery, personal theft, household
theft, burglary and motor vehicle theft.
   A total of 4.9 percent of households experienced a violent
crime, with 3.9 percent suffering assault, 1 percent robbery and
0.1 percent rape, the survey found. The year before, violent crime
had hit 4.8 percent of homes.
   Meanwhile, 17.8 percent of households suffered from some kind of
theft, 11.2 percent personal theft and 8.1 percent household theft;
5.1 percent suffered from a burglary and 1.6 percent motor vehicle
theft.
   The survey found that, as in previous years, black households,
urban households and households with higher incomes suffered a
higher percentage of crimes last year.
   A total of 29.1 percent of all black households suffered from
any NCS-surveyed crime _ a slight increase from 29 percent in 1988.
And 6.4 percent of them suffered from a violent crime, a decrease
from 6.6 percent in 1988.
   As for households headed by Caucasians, 24.3 percent suffered
from an NCS-surveyed crime, up from 23.9 percent the previous year.
And 4.7 percent were victimized by a violent crime, a slight
increase from 4.6 in 1988.
   Some 25.5 percent of the households of other races combined _
Asians, Pacific Islanders and Native Americans _ were victimized by
an NCS-surveyed crime, down from 27.4 percent in 1988. The
percentage of those homes that suffered from a violent crime also
decreased to 5.4 percent from 5.6 percent.
   A separate category for Hispanics and non-Hispanics shows that a
greater percentage of Hispanic households suffered an NCS crime
last year than in 1988. Last year, 33.8 percent of households
headed by Hispanics were victims of an NCS crime, up from 30
percent the previous year. Meanwhile, 7.3 percent of Hispanic
households suffered a violent crime, up from 6.5 percent in 1988.
   The percentage of urban households that have been victims of
crime increased from 30.3 percent to 31.2 percent. A greater number
of suburban households also were victimized _ up from 23.8 percent
to 24.2 percent. At the same time, rural households experienced
less crime, with only 17.2 percent suffering compared with 18
percent in 1988.
   The portion of households with incomes of $15,000 and above that
suffered from a crime edged downward last year while crime hit a
larger portion of households with lower incomes than it had in
1988. Still, the households with the highest target rate _ 27
percent _ were those with incomes of $25,000 or more.

   Finance Minister Yitzhak Modai said today that
if the United States goes ahead with proposals to forgive Egypt's
multibillion dollar debt, Israel will demand that most of its debt
to the Americans also be erased.
   Egypt owes the United States $6.7 billion from previous arms
sales, and Israel owes $4.6 billion. The two are the largest
recipients of U.S. foreign aid. Each year, Israel receives $3
billion and Egypt gets $2.3 billion.
   ``It doesn't make sense that Egypt gets a waiver and Israel
stays out of it,'' Modai told Israel radio. ``It is ridiculous.''
   He said he would raise the subject when he visits Washington in
two weeks.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said he hoped Israel would receive
additional economic aid from the United States.
   ``It's not a question of cancellation (of debt), but I think
that our representatives will ask the United States for finding
some ways to solve, to help us solve our economic problems,''
Shamir told reporters today.
   Bush administration officials say the president is considering
forgiving the Egyptian debt as a reward to Egypt for joining the
U.S.-led multinational force in the Persian Gulf and taking part in
the trade embargo against Iraq.
   Israel has maintained a low profile in the crisis, reportedly at
the request of the Americans who fear an Israeli role could break
up the alliance of moderate Arab states against Iraq.
   Foreign Ministry officials refused to discuss Modai's plans,
saying any comments could interfere with Foreign Minister David
Levy's trip to Washington. He is to meet Secretary of State James
A. Baker III on Wednesday.
   Modai also said he would demand substantial increases in U.S.
aid to help absorb Soviet immigrants to Israel. Some estimates say
Israel needs $30 billion to $40 billion to absorb about 1 million
immigrants over the next five years.
   Israel already has asked for $400 million in U.S. loan
guarantees to help settle the Soviets, but the request has not been
fulfilled because of American fears the money would be used to
increase Jewish settlements in the occupied territories.
   The new demands came after Israel asked Washington for
additional advanced weapons, complaining of increased danger from
the Iraqis and from new U.S. weapons expected to be supplied to
Saudi Arabia.
   The list of weapons requested by Israel reportedly includes more

<TEXT>
   Construction spending posted a slight 0.4
percent gain in July, the first advance in four months, the
government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said residential, non-residential and
government spending totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
$442.2 billion.
   Construction spending had not risen since a 0.4 percent increase
last March. It had fallen 0.9 percent in both May and June and 1.9
percent in April.
   But today's report showed spending in June was weaker than first
reported. The department initially had said spending was unchanged.
   Analysts have attributed the general weakness to high interest
rates, tight lending requirements and, in some areas, overbuilding
that resulted in major vacancies.
   The weakness has been illustrated in recent Labor Department
reports showing the loss of 100,000 construction jobs since last
fall. The latest report said payrolls fell by 50,000 in July, after
seasonal adjustment, for their fifth consecutive decline.
   Construction spending in July was 3.1 percent above that of the
same month in 1989, when it totaled $429.0 billion.
   Residential spending in July slipped 0.4 percent to $190.5
billion after posting a 3.4 percent loss in June.
   Single-family spending was down 1.3 percent to $110.2 billion
after a 1.6 percent drop a month earlier. Apartment construction
fell 1.6 percent to $18.4 billion after a 3.6 percent drop in June.
   Non-residential spending, led by industrial construction, rose
2.5 percent to $107.5 billion after a 1.8 percent gain the previous
month. Industrial building was up a strong 9.3 percent to $22.4
billion.
   Government spending edged down 0.2 percent to $108.6 billion
after rising 0.7 percent the previous month.

   Former Sen. Lawton Chiles faced
Rep. Bill Nelson for the Democratic nomination for governor today
after a bruising campaign in which Chiles was dogged by questions
about his mental stability.
   In Nevada, Gov. Bob Miller was favored to beat five Democratic
unknowns, including a man who changed his name to Rhinestone
Cowboy, and win nomination for a full term. Businessman Jim
Gallaway led the Republican field of eight.
   About one-third of Florida's 5.4 million registered voters were
expected to turn out. ``Our phones have been busy this morning, and
that's a good sign,'' Dade County Elections Supervisor David Leahy
said.
   After Florida's bitter Democratic campaign, Gov. Bob Martinez, a
virtual shoo-in for the GOP nomination, savored the damage his
rivals did to each other.
   ``I've gotten what I need out of the Democratic primary,'' said
campaign manager J.M. ``Mac'' Stipanovich.
   Chiles, 60, was questioned about his mental health, age and
tenure in Washington during the campaign. He released medical
records about his battle with depression and acknowledged taking
the controversial drug Prozac to treat it.
   Nelson's running mate, state House Speaker Tom Gustafson, was
widely criticized and finally apologized for suggesting Chiles
could be suicidal, and some polls indicated Nelson suffered a
backlash from the negative campaigning.
   Chiles, who retired from the Senate in 1989 after three terms,
held a double-digit lead over the six-term congressman in recent
polls.
   He countered Nelson's attacks by pointing to his experience and
his self-imposed $100 limit on individual campaign contributions,
which he said demonstrated his independence. Nelson raised $6
million to Chiles' $2 million.
   Chiles and Nelson, who both took part in the Fort Lauderdale
Labor Day parade, have promised to work for the Democratic nominee.
Democrats are worried, though, because a bitter 1986 primary was
credited with enabling Martinez to become Florida's second GOP
governor since Reconstruction.
   Martinez was expected to win the GOP nomination easily against
maverick state Sen. Marlene Woodson Howard, who criticized Martinez
for his support of a services tax that was later repealed and his
anti-abortion activism.
   In Nevada, Miller, as lieutenant governor, assumed the
governor's chair in 1988 when Democrat Dick Bryan jumped to the
U.S. Senate midway through his term.
   Providing a little color was Rhinestone Cowboy, 61. He changed
his name from Vernon Hall years ago to promote his line of
rhinestone-encrusted Western clothing and is a perennial candidate
for posts such as mayor and sheriff.
   On the GOP side, Gallaway was accused by another contender,
builder Charlie Brown, of trying to buy the election with slick TV
ads. Gallaway outspent Brown 4-to-1. None of the other Republican
candidates mounted a major campaign.
   A plane crash Monday seriously injured two candidates in
Nevada's primary _ Sue Wagner, running for lieutenant governor, and
Bob Seale, who is running for treasurer. Seale's wife, Judy, was
killed in the crash, authorities said.
   Five people were aboard the twin-engine plane that crashed after
takeoff from Fallon for a Labor Day parade in Carson City. Two
aides to the candidates suffered less serious injuries and were
taken to a hospital, authorities said.

   Columbia and the observatory inside
its cargo bay were pronounced trouble-free as the clock ticked on
toward a Thursday launch and NASA's first shuttle flight in more
than four months.
   It is the third countdown for the astronomy mission, which was
delayed by fuel leaks in May and telescope problems last week.
Liftoff is set for 1:20 a.m. EDT.
   ``Everybody's very comfortable,'' test director Al Sofge said
today. ``We're just proceeding down through the count, business as
usual, doing what we do best, no problems.''
   Columbia was supposed to have lifted off May 30 with the $150
million observatory, but the launch was scrubbed because of a
hydrogen leak. Atlantis was found a month later to have a similar
problem, and NASA temporarily grounded the three-shuttle fleet.
   NASA replaced Columbia's leaky hydrogen lines and rescheduled
liftoff for Saturday, but that attempt was abandoned because of
communication problems with Astro's 1,500-pound X-ray telescope.
The problem was fixed over the weekend.
   Four of Columbia's seven astronauts are astronomers who will
take turns operating Astro's three ultraviolet telescopes round the
clock. The X-ray telescope will be managed from the ground.
   The nine- to 10-day flight will be the first shuttle mission in
five years devoted entirely to scientific research.
   NASA plans to move Discovery to the other shuttle launch pad
tonight for a flight in October with the Ulysses spacecraft, which
will be sent on a five-year journey to explore the sun's polar
regions.
   That mission will be followed in November by Atlantis'
classified Pentagon flight, originally scheduled for July.
   NASA had hoped for nine shuttle missions this year but so far
has flown only three.
   The last shuttle flight was in April, when Discovery carried the
Hubble Space Telescope into orbit. The $1.5 billion observatory
later was found to have a flawed mirror that produces blurry images.
   Astronomers have been waiting 4{ years for the Astro mission.
   Columbia originally was scheduled to lift off with Astro in
March 1986 to study, among other things, Halley's comet. The
mission and all others were postponed after the Challenger disaster.
   On its revamped schedule, Astro will examine some of the hottest
objects in the universe, including a supernova and Comet Levy,
which is making its first recorded pass through the solar system.
   The observatory will remain on aboard and return to Earth for
possible re-use.

   A retired CIA agent accused of trying to hide
his Iran-Contra arms profits from U.S. tax collectors is going on
trial in a case expected to lay out the scandal's money trail.
   Thomas G. Clines, 62, of Middleburg, Va., is accused of
under-reporting earnings on his 1985 and 1986 tax returns and
failing to tell the Internal Revenue Service about overseas bank
accounts.
   Jury selection began today in federal court.
   The trial is expected to focus on profits made in the secret
network that was run by Reagan administration officials and
supplied arms to Iran and the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   Clines, who retired from the CIA in 1978 after a 29-year career,
was indicted Feb. 22. If convicted, he could get 16 years in prison
and $1 million in fines.
   ``We thought the case should never have been brought,'' said
defense attorney Paula M. Junghans.
   Prosecutors contend that in 1985 and 1986 Clines reaped about
$882,000 in commissions for helping buy and sell arms to Iran and
the Contras. Some of the money was kept in a foreign account
code-named C.Tea, according to the congressional Iran-Contra report
issued in 1987.
   Clines reported gross income of $265,000 for the tax year 1985
and $402,513 for 1986, the indictment said.
   Iranian-born businessman Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj.
Gen. Richard V. Secord, who took part in the arms network also run
by Oliver North and former national security adviser John M.
Poindexter, are expected to take the stand for the government.
   Clines was a CIA agent in Southeast Asia and was involved in the
Bay of Pigs invasion in Cuba. He became director of training in
clandestine operations.

   In a move that could undermine talks on
a U.N. plan to end the Cambodian war, the Khmer Rouge said today it
would not attend a peace conference in Indonesia unless the
Cambodian prime minister agrees to go.
   Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan said he had planned to leave
for Jakarta on Wednesday but changed his mind after hearing state
radio report that Cambodia's Premier Hun Sen would not attend the
talks, set to begin Thursday.
   He said that showed Phnom Penh and Vietnam ``are not sincere in
the search of a solution'' and did not accept the U.N. peace plan.
   Khieu Samphan said, however, he would go to Jakarta if Hun Sen
also went.
   ``If Hun Sen doesn't go, there is no point in having any
meeting,'' said another Khmer Rouge official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Fighting will continue, he said.
   ``Fighting has the aim of forcing the Vietnamese to talk,'' he
said.
   Indonesia's foreign minister, Ali Alatas, said he was
disappointed by the threat to the talks, and said he was trying to
resolve the problems.
   ``The whole world is placing its hope on the Jakarta meeting,''
he said. ``Now is the best time to try it. The Cambodian leaders
should be able to see this.''
   The Khmer Rouge has by far the most powerful guerrilla army
because of arms aid from China. Many countries say that despite the
group's brutal record when it ruled Cambodia in the 1970s, Khmer
Rouge participation in a negotiated settlement is crucial because
the guerrillas otherwise would keep on fighting.
   Prince Norodom Ranariddh, whose guerrillas are allied with the
Khmer Rouge, also said today he would not attend for the same
reason Khieu Samphan gave.
   Both Ranariddh and Hun Sen said they were sending subordinates
to the Jakarta meeting.
   Hun Sen had announced he was not attending because Prince
Norodom Sihanouk, Ranariddh's father and leader of the
three-faction guerrilla coalition, said he was not attending.
   Son Sann, who leads the third guerrilla group, the Khmer
People's National Liberation Front, is expected to participate.
   The guerrillas are allied in a coalition fighting the government
that Vietnam installed in Phnom Penh after invading the country in
late 1978.
   Hopes for a settlement were raised after the five permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council, who back different sides in
the conflict, adopted a comprehensive peace plan for Cambodia last
week. The members are the United States, the Soviet Union, China,
France and Britain.
   Their plan called for the United Nations to supervise five key
government ministries in the period before a general election. A
Supreme National Council, comprising representatives of Phnom Penh
and the guerrillas, would act as a figurehead government.
   The Khmer Rouge is composed of fanatical Communists who killed
hundreds of thousands of people when they ruled Cambodia from 1975
until Vietnam's invasion. Hun Sen and other Phnom Penh leaders held
positions of authority during the Khmer Rouge reign until they
defected under threat of purges.

   The Most Rev. Robert F. Joyce, the
retired Roman Catholic bishop of Burlington, has died at age 93
after a long illness.
   Joyce, who died Sunday night, was active in the community beyond
his church activities. He was the first clergyman elected a trustee
at the University of Vermont.
   ``He bridged various religious groups, educational institutions,
health organizations and the rich and the poor,'' said J. Warren
McClure, former publisher of The Burlington Free Press.
   ``His greatest impact on the community was in the area of being
open to people of every religion, including those who had no
religion,'' said former Mayor Francis Cain.
   Joyce was ordained a priest in 1923 and served in several
Vermont parishes. He was named by Pope Pius XII to head the church
in Vermont in 1957. He served as bishop until his retirement in
1972.
   The diocese didn't know of any surviving relatives.
   A funeral Mass was scheduled for Thursday at St. Michael the
Archangel Chapel at St. Michael's College in Colchester.

   Iraq has suggested setting up an
international ``people's court'' to try President Bush for defiling
Islam and for human rights violations.
   The state-run Iraqi News Agency said today the idea was
discussed by the nation's union for lawyers and human rights
association.
   Hamel al-Rawi, vice chairman of the lawyers association, was
quoted as saying that several prominent Arab and non-Arab figures
had been contacted to participate in the tribunal.
   They were not named, nor was any time frame given for such a
tribunal.
   The INA dispatch, monitored in Cyprus, did not give details on
specific charges against Bush, except for ``defilement of Islamic
sanctities.''
   That refers to complaints from various conservative Moslem
figures throughout the Middle East over the deployment of U.S.
forces in Saudi Arabia, the site of Islam's two holiest shrines,
Mecca and Medina.
   Iraq has repeatedly complained that the U.N.-imposed embargo
against it, in which the United States plays the largest role,
violates international law and human rights by depriving the nation
of food and medical supplies.

<TEXT>
   Jordan's crown prince today criticized the
international community for doing little to help thousands of Asian
refugees from Iraq and Kuwait, some of whom are dying from exposure
in the desert.
   International organizations trying to cope with the refugee
flood said more funds were urgently needed to tackle the crisis.
   An estimated 420,000 refugees, most of them Arabs, have poured
into Jordan across the desert since Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait
Aug. 2. Many Arabs have been repatriated, but more than 100,000
Asians _ Indians, Sri Lankans, Bangladeshis, Thais and Filipinos _
remain stranded in Jordan.
   Some are stuck in a squalid, makeshift camp in the no man's land
just inside Jordan because authorities at the border post of
Ruweishid, swamped by the human tide, has not been able to process
them.
   The Jordanians have said they cannot let them in until their
home governments guarantee aircraft or ships to evacuate them.
   Prince Hassan, brother of King Hussein, appealed for immediate
aid.
   ``We should not forget that the situation, critical as it is,
may be only the tip of the iceberg,'' he told a news conference
organized by the U.N. Disaster and Relief Agency.
   Although much attention has been given to the Westerners trapped
in Iraq and Kuwait, little has been focused on the Asians and other
refugees.
   At the desert camp at Shaalan _ 25 miles from Rusweishid, where
41,000 people await transport home _ refugees are dying from
exposure in the parching sun and chilling temperatures at night,
the aid workers said Monday.
   One doctor said he feared outbreaks of deadly diseases such as
cholera and typhus because of ``non-existent'' sanitation
conditions.
   ``Things are so bad we don't even know how many have died.
People are in awful shape,'' said Rebecca Salti, an American
settled in Jordan who works with Save the Children.
   Dick Clay, an American construction manager who spent three days
at the camp after fleeing Kuwait disguised as a Filipino, said he
thought people would start killing one another over supplies if
nothing is done to help them.
   Hassan said today that the United Nations should be helping, and
he appealed to U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to
appoint a representative to tackle the crisis.
   ``The plight of these people ... has only evoked the faintest of
responses from the world community and from a world press more
interested in war scenarios than in humantarian relief,'' he
declared.
   The Office of the U.N. Disaster Relief Coordinator, UNDRO, which
is overseeing the international relief effort, said governments had
contributed only $9.5 million toward its $60 million appeal.
   The Geneva-based International Organization for Migration said
it needed more than $23 million to help evacuate Asians whose
countries were too poor to meet transportation costs from the
Mideast.
   India said today it has chartered aircraft and is exploring the
possibilty of hiring ships to bring back stranded Indians. A
foreign ministry spokesman said India also has sent food to Amman
for the refugees.
   ``We are trying our best to bring back all those Indians who
want to come home,'' spokesman Aftab Seth said.
   A Virgin Atlantic Boeing 747 departed London today for Amman,
where it was expected to pick up 150 British citizens and 250
Egyptians. The flight left with nearly 30 tons of supplies
requested by Jordan, including 26,000 blankets, five tons of rice
and flour donated by supermarkets, and 2{ tons of antibiotics,
solutions to combat dehydration and other medicines.
   ``King Hussein of Jordan has given us a list of things he needs
which is frightening. It goes on for pages,'' said Richard Branson,
an airline executive.
   A U.N. food agency announced today it would provide 3,446 tons
of emergency food aid for refugees in Jordan. The $1.9 million food
shipment, including wheat flour, canned fish, meat and cheese will
be distributed to 120,000 people over 90 days, said the World Food
Program.
   Aid workers at the desert camp have described scenes of violence.
   In one case, refugees bashed in an Indian woman's face with a
water jug. In another, several thousand refugees beat an Indian who
volunteered to help relief workers when they suspected him of
cheating in distributing tents.
   Turkey, like Jordan, has received thousands of refugees over the
past month since Iraq invaded Kuwait, and refugees described
similarly desperate conditions at a camp on the Iraqi side of the
Turkey-Iraq frontier.
   They said at least three Pakistanis, including a woman giving
birth, have died. Pakistan's military attache in Ankara, Staff Col.
Arshad Setih, called the conditions ``deplorable.''
   The Philippines has asked the governments of its Asian neighbors
to help evacuate thousands of Filipinos in Jordan, Foreign
Secretary Raul Manglapus said today in Manila.

   U.S. Coast Guardsmen boarded an
Iraqi-flagged freighter in the Gulf of Oman today in an effort to
enforce the international embargo on Iraqi trade, naval and
shipping sources reported.
   It was the first reported case of U.S. forces boarding an
Iraqi-flagged vessel since the U.N. sanctions were clamped on Iraq
last month to punish Baghdad for invading Kuwait.
   Last week, the U.N. Security Council authorized dozens of
warships in the region to use military force to uphold the
sanctions.
   The shipping sources said the 3,549-ton Zanoobia was laden with
tea picked up in Colombo, Sri Lanka, and apparently bound for Iraq.
   The U.S. warships intercepted the vessel in the Gulf of Oman
before it could reach the Strait of Hormuz, the gateway to the
Persian Gulf, the sources said on condition of anonymity.
   U.S. Navy officials in Manama refused to give details of the
reported incident. Other reports that the vessel was seized and
taken to the Omani port of Muscat could not immediately be
confirmed.
   The only other ship that U.S. forces are reported to have
boarded and subsequently prevented from docking was the 91,478-ton
Kota Wirama, managed by the Pacific International Lines of
Singapore.
   That vessel was intercepted in the Red Sea Aug. 28, boarded and
searched, and then prevented from proceeding to the Jordanian port
of Aqaba.
   Jordan has been one of the weak links in the blockade because of
its pro-Iraqi sympathies and its relatively open northeastern
border with Iraq.
   The Pentagon has reported that more than 350 ships of various
nationalities have been challenged by U.S. warships in the Persian
Gulf and the Red Sea, and at least 10 boarded since the U.N.
Security Council decreed the embargo.
   About four dozen Coast Guard members, trained on boarding
vessels in the Caribbean to search for drugs, have been sent out to
help the Navy with cases that necessitate boarding to check ship
registers and cargo.

   A group of handicapped war veterans
and mothers of Sandinista soldiers killed fighting Contra rebels
occupied the government television network for a second day today
to demand higher pensions.
   About 30 protesters, some in wheelchairs, took over the building
early Monday evening and the network went off the air shortly
afterward.
   ``We took over the television plant to pressure the government
to increase the pensions,'' Fernando Lopez, national coordinator of
the Sandinista war handicapped said by telephone after the takeover.
   ``They are starving us by offering us a (monthly) pension of
just 21 million cordobas (about $21), while on the other hand the
government is giving the Contras who demobilized 50 million
cordobas ($50),'' he said.
   The one-time payments to hundreds of former Contra rebels were
made Monday by the International Support and Verification
Commission.
   The commission was formed to help oversee the disbanding and
relocation of the rebels under an agreement to end their
9-year-old, U.S.-backed war against the Sandinistas and to ensure a
peaceful transition of power after the Sandinistas' Feb. 25
election defeat.
   The Contra payments were part of $40 million in U.S. government
assistance for the demobilization and part of a $300 million U.S.
aid package for the government of President Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro.
   ``We will stay here until President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro
resolves the problem for us,'' Lopez said.
   Before the takeover, the group had tried to march to Mrs.
Chamorro's office to demand a meeting, but it was turned away by
police.
   Presidential spokesman Danilo Lacayo said in a radio broadcast
late Monday that he, another aide and television officials went to
the station to talk to the protesters but were attacked by people
with the veterans.
   He said police had to intervene but did not say how they were
attacked or if anyone was injured.
   Antonio Ibarra, vice minister of the presidency, said an 81.3
percent increase for 2,000 military pensioners, including the
handicapped, was agreed to in a meeting on Friday. The 21 million

   College students headed back to class
today in this fear-stricken town as investigators said the killer
stalking young women seemed to be taunting authorities by the way
he arranged evidence at the scene.
   ``In the scene, the set-up, there was a message _ to law
enforcement, to whoever,'' police Capt. R.B. Ward said Monday. ``He
was very calculated, very methodical in the way the person did
things, as well as left things.''
   Authorities would not elaborate on how evidence was arranged.
   Classes for more than 40,000 students resumed at the University
of Florida and Santa Fe Community College today after the Labor Day
weekend. UF spokesman Larry Humes said at midmorning that a spot
check with faculty members showed that a ``vast majority'' of the
student body was back in class.
   Students remained afraid amid warnings that the killer who
stabbed four women and a man in their off-campus apartments may
still be in their midst.
   Many students came back armed. University President John
Lombardi said 100 of the school's 34,000 students transferred or
dropped out.
   ``I'm really petrified, afraid,'' said Michelle, an 18-year-old
freshman from Plantation who refused to give her last name and said
she fled town after the bodies were found. ``But I bought some Mace
and a baseball bat. I'm prepared.''
   The killer stalking trim brunettes slipped in through windows or
doors in three attacks within miles of each other, police said. The
victims attended either the university or the college and were
discovered Aug. 26-28. Three were mutilated.
   ``He is spending considerable time at the scene. I don't think
any of us can say how long. We're each of the opinion it wasn't in
and out,'' said Ward, a leader of a 175-member task force
investigating the slayings.
   ``When we walked in, we saw the `play' he had set up for us,''
added J.O. Jackson, lead investigator for the Florida Department of
Law Enforcement. The messages weren't written but seemed to be
daring police to catch the killer, he said.
   Police said they have four primary suspects, including Edward
Humphrey, a mentally disturbed university freshman jailed on
charges of beating his grandmother. The 18-year-old is being held
on $1 million bail.
   Humphrey lived briefly this summer at an apartment complex where
two victims were slain and at a dormitory where a third lived,
police said.
   The Gainesville Sun, citing no sources, reported Monday that
circumstantial evidence pointing to Humphrey includes that he walks
with a limp from an accident and that one victim's leg was
mutilated. Police had no comment on the report.
   Humphrey's fingerprints and footprints and samples of his blood
have been taken, police said. His psychiatric records also were
seized.
   His apartment remained under guard over the weekend, while
officers continued searching a murky creek near the scene of the
most recent slaying.
   Defense attorney J.R. Russo said he would ask for a reduction in
bail at a hearing scheduled for Thursday morning.
   ``Are we just holding a citizen just because he fits a certain
mental psychological profile or do they have specific evidence
which justifies a million dollar bond?'' he asked. ``A lot of
improper things have taken place.''
   Some students said they felt relatively safe because of the
security in the dorms and because the slayings were off campus.
   ``I don't think we should stop our lives because of it,'' said
Laura Whitkowsky, 18, a freshman from Port St. Lucie. ``My parents
wanted me to come home, but I told them the dorm was the safest
place to be.''
   Lincoln M. Llopiz of Miami and his wife sold Mace on a street
corner near campus Monday. Business for the $7.99 canisters was
slow.
   ``There is more panic in Miami than Gainesville,'' said Llopiz,
who brought 17,000 containers but had sold fewer than 10 by early
evening.
   University freshmen Sonja Larson, 18, and Christina Powell, 17,
were found slain Aug. 26. The body of community college student
Christa Hoyt was discovered the next day. Tracey Paules, 23, and
Manuel Taboada, 23, were found dead a day later.

<TEXT>
   Laura Washington, a smoky-voiced jazz
vocalist who sang with Erskine Hawkins' orchestra on Broadway in
the 1940s and made the hit record ``I've Got A Right To Cry,'' has
died of cancer. She was 64.
   A memorial service was planned tonight for Miss Washington, who
died Thursday. Members of the Birmingham Heritage Band planned to
play an old Johnny Mercer ballad, ``Laura,'' in her memory.
   Miss Washington made her debut at the Strand Theater on Broadway
in 1946, the same year she made ``I've Got A Right To Cry.'' She
performed in the 1940s as the only woman member of Hawkins'
18-piece band.
   In New York, Miss Washington met her idol, Ella Fitzgerald, and
became friends with another Alabama native, blues singer Dinah
Washington.
   ``Her whole style was similar to Ella's,'' said Birmingham jazz
musician J.L. Lowe.
   Lowe, who discovered Miss Washington's singing talents as a
child and later recommended her to Hawkins, said she could have
become a jazz legend if she had not left her career in the 1950s to
return to Birmingham to raise a family.
   She did not sing professionally again for more than 25 years,
until her children were grown and her husband, Julian Dash, had
died. She returned in the 1980s to perform weekends at a downtown
club, Grundy's.
   ``Musicians who remembered her from the old days were astounded
to find out she still had that voice, even in her 60s,'' said Lowe.
``Her voice was like an instrument. It was a gift.''

   At least 40 blacks were killed
in savage township fighting, including 11 who died when soldiers
fired assault rifles today on a crowd at a migrant workers' hostel,
police said.
   The latest violence came as President F.W. de Klerk and African
National Congress leader Nelson Mandela toured the townships to
call for an end to the black factional fighting that has killed
more than 550 people in the past three weeks.
   The worst fighting occurred in Sebokeng, south of Johannesburg,
where police said they entered a migrant workers' hostel to
investigate the deaths of four men, believed to be township
residents abducted by the hostel dwellers.
   An armed mob of up to 5,000 gathered outside the hostel, saying
they wanted to launch a revenge attack on Zulus inside, police said.
   When the mob refused to disperse, army troops were called in and
a ``shooting incident occurred,'' said police Col. Frans Malherbe.
He said 11 bodies were found after the mob dispersed.
   Malherbe said both the police and military were investigating
the shooting.
   Township resident N. Khumalo said the soldiers ``took up a
position, cocked their guns _ I thought maybe they wanted to scare
the people.''
   ``All of a sudden there was shooting. Many of the people ran.
Some of the people fell,'' Khumalo was quoted as saying by the
independent South African Press Association.
   Police said 36 people were killed in various clashes today in
Sebokeng. They reported four deaths overnight in Vosloorus and
Katlehong, southeast of Johannesburg. Witnesses said several more
people were killed in the two townships, but the deaths could not
be confirmed.
   They also said they arrested 150 men in connection with the
earlier violence in the hostel and confiscated four AK-47 assault
rifles.
   Mandela visited Sebokeng today and said he was ``outraged''
after viewing corpses at the local mortuary.
   A SAPA reporter following Mandela into the township, Lew Elias,
said his vehicle was stoned, overturned and set alight by angry
township youths. Elias suffered only minor injuries.
   In Vosloorus, southeast of Johannesburg, witnesses said Zulus
loyal to the conservative Inkatha movement stoned houses and set
them alight Monday night. A similar attack was reported in
neighboring Katlehong. Police and witnesses reported 10 deaths in
the two townships.
   In renewed clashes in Vosloorus today, Zulus from a workers'
hostel used axes, spears, shovels and other weapons to attack
houses. Township residents, some with gas bombs, tried a
counterattack on the hostel, but police repeatedly fired tear gas
and shotguns to keep the two sides apart. Some women packed their
children and belongings in trucks and fled the area.
   Much of the recent fighting has pitted Inkatha-supporting Zulus
living in the hostels against blacks in the townships who back the
African National Congress, the country's largest opposition
movement.
   De Klerk, meanwhile, was mobbed by youths and greeted with cries
of ``Viva, de Klerk,'' as he toured the huge Soweto township
outside Johannesburg.
   At one stop, he visited a migrant workers hostel whose residents
have been involved in the recent battles. ``He's a brave man to
come here. He must be a good leader,'' said one man living in the
run-down hostel.
   Afterward de Klerk told a news conference: ``I'm glad we could
visit the hostel and that we could see ... circumstances which are
absolutely unacceptable.''
   De Klerk says the government wants to provide family housing for
all blacks, but the current housing shortage makes it impractical
to tear down existing hostels for single working men.
   The ANC and its allies blame the police for fueling the township
violence and claim the force has been siding with Inkatha.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok again denied the charges,
saying government opponents were waging an orchestrated campaign to
discredit the police. Individual policemen may have acted
improperly, but the force as a whole has been impartial and
prevented the violence from escalating, Vlok said in an interview
with government-run television.
   De Klerk has ordered Vlok to investigate the allegations of
improper police conduct.
   But Mandela said Monday there should be an independent inquiry.
   A leader of the pro-apartheid Conservative Party said Monday
that police should let black factions fight each other instead of
facing criticism for trying to intervene.
   ``The question is why do Mandela and other black leaders not
stop their own supporters ... or is it an admission that they have
lost control,'' said Moolman Mentz, the party's spokesman for law
and order.
   Mandela has repeatedly refused to meet Inkatha leader Mangosuthu
Buthelezi, an old friend.
   The ANC says Buthelezi is using the violence obtain a meeting
with Mandela and enhance his stature. Buthelezi, meanwhile, says
the ANC wants to crush all opposition and is to blame for the
fighting.
   The ANC-Inkatha feud has claimed some 5,000 lives since 1986 in
the eastern province of Natal, where most of the blacks are Zulus.

<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
today proposed an international conference on the Persian Gulf
crisis that would also take up the Arab-Israeli conflict and the
civil war in Lebanon.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir suggested Israel might
attend an international conference if invited, but only if
discussions were limited to the gulf crisis.
   In a major foreign policy address delivered in the Pacific coast
city of Vladivostok, Shevardnadze also said Sunday's superpower
summit in Helsinki, Finland, would mark ``a major milestone on the
road toward resolving the crisis in the Persian Gulf.''
   He repeated Moscow's condemnation of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait and appealed anew for a resolution by diplomatic means
rather than military force. The text of his speech was distributed
by the official Tass news agency.
   ``For the first time in history, the international community has
acted with ... unanimity and firmness in response to aggression and
in seeking to eliminate its consequences,'' Shevardnadze told an
international meeting on Asian relations.
   ``But it is essential to pursue our objective through
non-military means and in a way that would remove the military
presence of other countries,'' he said.
   In proposing the international conference on the Middle East,
Shevardnadze linked the Persian Gulf crisis to the conflict between
the Palestinians and the Israelis, as well as the civil strife in
Lebanon.
   ``Presumably, Israel's agreement to its (a conference's)
convocation could exert a positive influence on the overall
situation in the Middle East and on efforts to defuse the crisis in
the Persian Gulf,'' the Soviet foreign minister said.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has proposed that a pullout of
his troops from Kuwait be contingent upon an Israeli withdrawal
from the occupied territories. The United States and Israel
rejected the plan.
   If Israel were to participate in the conference, Shevardnadze
said, ``The Soviet Union ... might take a fresh look at the issue
of Soviet-Israeli relations.''
   The Soviet Union and Israel have not had diplomatic relations
since the 1967 Middle East War, although both countries have been
moving closer in recent months.
   In Jerusalem, Shamir said Israel would consider participating in
the Soviet-proposed international conference, although Israel has
been careful to avoid any direct involvement in the gulf crisis.
   ``I still haven't received this proposal. After we hear it and
we examine its details, we will decide,'' Shamir told reporters.
However, he reiterated the Israeli refusal to discuss the
Palestinian question at such a forum.
   Israel has vehemently opposed previous Soviet-backed ideas to
hold an international conference to resolve the Arab-Israeli
conflict, including the Palestinian issue.
   ``We have our position about an international conference around
the solution of the Israeli-Arab conflict. We will not participate
in such an international conference,'' Shamir said.
   Shevardnadze also said such a conference should not delay
efforts by the United Nations to achieve a peaceful settlement in
the Persian Gulf.
   He blamed the ``great powers'' _ a reference to the Soviet Union
and the United States _ for supplying arms in the region.
   ``Unless peace comes to the Middle East, we shall continue to
pay a huge price for its wars,'' he said. ``It is time that we
acted now in the interests of the world's integrity.''
   Shevardnadze, who traveled later to Tokyo, also proposed that
all foreign ministers from Asian countries meet in Vladivostok in
the autumn of 1993 to discuss issues relating to the region, Tass
said. He said the details could be discussed at an upcoming session
of the U.N. General Assembly.

   The most influential of five state
lawmakers charged with taking bribes pleaded guilty today to a
federal corruption charge.
   Former state Rep. Robert Brown, who resigned his seat one day
before a grand jury indicted him Aug. 24, entered the plea before
U.S. District Judge Falcon B. Hawkins.
   Brown, former chairman of the House Labor, Commerce and Industry
Committee, was the first of the five indicted legislators to appear
before a federal judge. The five were indicted as part of a
16-month-old federal investigation.
   The bribe-taking charge carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in
prison and a fine of $250,000. Neither Brown nor prosecutors would
comment immediately on whether they had made a plea bargain that
would affect Brown's sentence.
   Court officials said Brown will remain free on bond during a
pre-sentencing investigation that would take three to six weeks.
   Brown was charged with taking a $2,000 bribe from lobbyist Ron
Cobb, who was working for the FBI in a videotaped operation.
   The indictment accused the 34-year-old Democrat of voting for
and promising to work ``behind the scenes'' for passage of a bill
that would have allowed voters to decide whether to permit
pari-mutuel betting in South Carolina.
   Brown's committee passed the bill in March 1989. The full House
never considered the legislation later that year or in 1990.
   In late July, shortly after news of the investigation broke,
Brown, who had served in the House since 1983, filed an amended
campaign report that disclosed he had received $2,500 cash from
Cobb in either April or May. The reports were due in June.
   At the time, Brown denied he took the money in exchange for his
service or his vote. ``I've never taken a dime with strings
attached,'' he said.
   Rick Lee, a Republican who resigned his Senate seat a week ago,
is scheduled to appear before a federal judge Sept. 10. Lee has
said he will plead guilty to accepting a $2,000 cash bribe from
Cobb.
   State Reps. Robert Kohn, Luther Taylor and Danny Winstead, along
with Brown and Lee, were indicted under the Hobbs Act, a federal
law banning acceptance of money or gifts in return for votes or
favors. Winstead also was indicted on a second charge of
obstruction of justice.
   All five defendants were required to plead innocent last week
because federal magistrates cannot accept guilty pleas.
   Kohn, a Republican who has said he will not seek re-election,
and Taylor, a Democrat, have been suspended from the House.
Winstead, a Republican, resigned his seat on Aug. 23.
   Taylor, indicted on six counts, faces a maximum sentence of 120
years in prison and a $1.5 million fine if convicted. Winstead
faces a total of 30 years in prison and a $500,000 fine if
convicted.

<TEXT>
   A five-nation African military force
moved today to expand areas of the capital under its control, and a
few fishing boats ventured into the city's port to sell fish to
Monrovia's hungry residents.
   About 3,000 soldiers from Ghana, Nigeria, Guinea, Sierra Leone
and Gambia landed at Monrovia's port Aug. 24 under orders to end
the eight-month tribal war that has left at least 5,000 people dead.
   The troops have been attacked by rebels loyal to Charles Taylor,
but were welcomed by President Samuel Doe and a rebel faction led
by Prince Johnson.
   The African force has ``done extremely well and better than
anybody expected,'' said a Western diplomat, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   The African troops were mobbed by Monrovia residents, who have
been isolated from the outside world for more than two months.
Water and electricity were cut off and most food stocks exhausted.
   Little fighting was reported today, and the commander of the
force, Ghanaian Lt. Gen. Arnold Quainoo, left for consulations with
the Gambian president, Sir Dawda Jawara. Jawara is president of the
Economic Community of West African States, which dispatched the
force to Liberia.
   Jawara was to meet with officials of Burkina Faso, whose
government has criticized the intervention and been accused of
intervening on the side of Taylor's rebels.
   Taylor has vowed to destroy the five-nation force, and declared
himself president of Liberia. But his forces have been unable to
dislodge troops loyal to Doe in Monrovia's eastern suburbs.
   Johnson, who split with Taylor after the rebel invasion of
Liberia Dec. 24, managed to fight his way into Monrovia but also
failed to drive Doe from his heavily fortified mansion. Doe's
troops and Johnson's men appeared to be largely observing a truce
that began the day the West African force landed.
   Reports from Lagos, Nigeria, said Nigeria was sending additional
arms, equipment and medical supplies to the five-nation force by
ship today.
   The United States, meanwhile, continued to evacuate foreigners
on a first-come, first-served basis from its embassy in Monrovia,
said an embassy official who declined to be further identified. A
contingent of U.S. Marines guarded the embassy.
   Evacuees were flown by helicopters to U.S. warships off the
Liberian coast, and then on to Freetown, Sierra Leone for flights
to Europe.

   A 4-year-old boy shot to death a

   The incident occurred Sunday when the officer, Somboon

said the provincial governor, Surat Thani.
   Somboon was visiting the boy's father and had apparently laid
his pistol on a bed while inside the house. The governor said the

   Half a million gum leaves are being
collected as part of a campaign to help the koala, whose population
is at an all-time low in Australia.
   The Australian Koala Foundation national headquarters will dry
the leaves, imprint ``I SAVED A KOALA TODAY'' on each, and mount
them on pins to be sold on Oct. 20, National Koala Day.
   A foundation spokeswoman, Ann Sharp, said the last official
koala count in 1986 turned up 400,000 of the animals in Australia.
Scientists believe the figure was highly inflated because many may
have been counted more than once.
   Decimated by shooting _ 3 million pelts were exported to the
United States in 1921 _ koalas are now suffering from urban sprawl
into their natural habitat along Australia's east coast.
   ``The need for help has never been greater,'' Ms. Sharp said.
``A half a million gum leaves is a hell of a lot. But we know the
public won't let us down. We can use most of what people rake up
and burn during their weekend gardening.''

   Floods caused by torrential rains
left more than 50,000 people homeless and destroyed this year's
crop in southwestern Ethiopia, it was reported Tuesday.
   The Ethiopian News Agency said the flooding along Sudan's border
occurred last week after the Baro river and several of its
tributaries broke their banks. The news agency said the floods also
disrupted electricity, water supplies, and telephone services in
Gambella, a provincial town on the banks of the Baro.
   Tiwat Paul, the secretary of the ruling Workers Party of
Ethiopia in the region, said 300 Gambella residents and 50,000
peasant farmers in the region lost their homes. Tiwat said the
floods also threatened a nearby Sudanese refugee camp.
   The camp, run by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, is
home to about 300,000 people who have fled civil war and periodic
famine in southern Sudan.

<TEXT>
   The anti-apartheid Daily Mail
newspaper published its final edition Tuesday, ending a 2{-month
effort to establish itself in Johannesburg's competitive morning
newspaper market.
   In a front-page commentary titled ``Gone, But Not Gone
Forever,'' the newspaper said its sister publication, the Weekly
Mail, would continue to publish every Friday.
   A company spokeswoman said some Daily Mail employees would be
shifted to the 4-year-old Weekly Mail.
   The Daily Mail, launched June 20, was a strong anti-apartheid
voice in the city's saturated morning newspaper market. There are
five remaining morning newspapers _ four English and one Afrikaans
_ and several weekly newspapers.
   Reports that the Daily Mail needed more money began circulating
last week. According to news reports, the newspaper had a
circulation of about 14,000 and needed 25,000 to break even.
   ``We have not raised the money needed to continue publishing the
daily and will now revert to publishing only the Weekly Mail,''
said Tuesday's commentary. It said the Weekly Mail's circulation
exceeded 30,000.
   ``We can only express dismay that the press remains in the hands
of so few people who have so much power over the industry and so
much control over what South Africans may or may not know,'' the
commentary said.
   ``This newspaper was a brief experiment to try and change the
situation; its suspension does not bode well for attempts to create
a more diverse press, an absolute precondition for a democratic
country.''

<HEAD>Death Toll From Typhoon Abe Rises to 88</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 88 people have died in two coastal
provinces that were battered by Typhoon Abe, an official report
said Tuesday.
   Abe, which landed Friday in south Zhejiang province, rampaged
through Shanghai, China's most populous city, then headed back out
to sea Monday afternoon, the China Daily reported.
   The death toll in Zhejiang now stands at 65, with 839 injured,
660,000 stranded by floods and 40,000 left homeless, the report
said.
   Half the province's land area and one-fourth of its population _
or 10 million people _ were affected by Typhoon Abe. It was
reported to be the worst typhoon to hit the province in 34 years.
   In neighboring Jiangsu province, 23 people diede and hundreds
were injured, mostly by collapsing buildings, the paper said. An
earlier report said three people died in Shanghai, China's largest
commercial and industrial city. It was not clear if the three were
included in the latest death toll of 88.

   Construction spending edged up 0.4 percent in
July for its first gain in four months, the government said
Tuesday, but analysts expect the industry to remain weak through
the end of the year.
   The Commerce Department said spending on residential,
non-residential and government buildings totaled a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $442.2 billion.
   Analysts had said the weakness in the construction industry was
due to consumer caution, high interest rates, tight lending
requirements and, in some areas, overbuilding.
   ``Iraq made things worse,'' said David Seiders, chief economist
for the National Association of Home Builders.
   Construction spending had not risen since a 0.4 percent increase
in March. It fell 0.9 percent in both May and June and 1.9 percent
in April.
   But the latest report showed spending in May and June was even
weaker than first reported. The department initially had said
spending in May was down just 0.3 percent and in June was unchanged.
   Labor Department employment reports further illustrate the
weakness. The department has said construction employment has
declined for five straight months, including the loss of 50,000
jobs in July, after seasonal adjustment. Payrolls have fallen by
100,000 since last fall.
   Residential spending in July fell 0.4 percent, to $190.5
billion, its fourth consecutive drop, including a 3.4 percent loss
in June.
   Single-family spending was down 1.3 percent, to $110.2 billion,
for its fourth straight decline, including a 1.6 percent drop in
June. Apartment construction fell 1.6 percent, to $18.4 billion,
after a 3.6 percent drop in June. It has fallen for three months.
   ``The new structure component will continue to move down,
certainly through the end of the year,'' Seiders said, adding that
the report implies strong performance only in additions and
alterations to existing structures.
   ``This is what we usually see in down cycles,'' he said.
``People just add on to houses.''
   Non-residential spending rose 2.5 percent, to $107.5 billion,
after a 1.8 percent gain the previous month.
   ``The only truly bright spot is the industrial component,''
which was up 9.3 percent in July, Seiders said. ``But the permit
information ... has been weakening and we expect this part of the
market will lose its momentum.''
   The other two major non-residential components _ office
buildings and other commercial construction such as shopping
centers _ remains weak, Seiders said.
   Government spending edged down 0.2 percent, to $108.6 billion,
after rising 0.7 percent the previous month.
   Overall construction spending in July was 3.1 percent above that
of July 1989, when it totaled $429.0 billion.

<HEAD>Bush Will Ask Congress to Forgive Egypt's Military Debt</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Combines pvs; edits to tighten; no pickup</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush has decided to ask Congress to
forgive Egypt's entire $7 billion military debt because of its
leadership in standing up to Iraqi aggression, the White House
announced today.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said forgiving the debt
``recognizes the strategic importance of Egypt'' in the
multinational effort to enforce the United Nations' trade embargo
against Baghdad.
   ``It is a symbol of our appreciation'' for the role played by
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Fitzwater said.
   Bush consulted with congressional leaders before making the
decision, Fitzwater said. Waiving Egypt's military debt _ largely
amassed through U.S. arms sales to Cairo _ requires an act of
Congress.
   Another $6 billion in non-military Egyptian debt to the United
States would not be affected, Fitzwater said.
   The announcement came after Bush met with his Cabinet for a
post-vacation briefing on the Persian Gulf crisis.
   He hinted that other packages for other countries in the region
helping enforce the embargo, including Israel, might be forthcoming
as well.
   ``We think we will be able to put together a rather sizeable
package of support for Middle Eastern countries that are in need as
a result of this'' effort against Iraq, Fitzwater said.
   Meanwhile, Fitzwater indicated that the president might expand
his trip next weekend to meet Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
to include a visit to another country on the way home from
Helsinki, Finland.
   Bush will leave Washington on Friday night for the one-day
summit with Gorbachev on Sunday. Fitzwater said that the summit
would follow the flexible pattern set by the two leaders in their
initial meeting last December at Malta.
   Fitzwater had no details on where Bush might stop on the way
home from Finland. After the Malta summit, the president addressed
NATO allies in Brussels.
   The White House official said the principal goal of the hastily
arranged Helsinki summit was ``sowing unity and support by the two
superpowers for the common objective of stopping Saddam Hussein.''
   Although Soviet support for the U.S.-led military effort to
enforce the trade embargo against Iraq has been lukewarm, Fitzwater
said, ``I find no area of disagreement'' with the Soviets on the
current Persian Gulf crisis.
   Fitzwater, meanwhile, denied there was a dispute with the
government of Saudi Arabia on which nation controls the decision to
launch a U.S. military offensive.
   ``It's a consultation process,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``We have an excellent working relationship with the Saudi
Arabian government,'' he added.
   Fitzwater, meanwhile, confirmed news reports that U.S. Coast
Guardsman had boarded an Iraqi-flagged freighter _ loaded with tea
_ in the Gulf of Oman in an effort to enforce the international
embargo.
   ``The ship was ordered to divert. It did not divert. It was then
boarded and now has diverted. We don't have information now on
where it's being diverted to,'' he said.
   The spokesman acknowledged that some goods have been trucked
into Iraq across the Jordanian border. But, he characterized this
as a minor broaching of the embargo and said it was ``not a problem
for the overall effectiveness of the sanctions.''
   Fitzwater, summing up the status of Americans who remain trapped
in Iraq and Kuwait, said there are 2,000 American citizens left in
Kuwait, of which 1200 are women and children.
   In Iraq, there are still 250 Americans, about half of whom are
women and children, Fitzwater said.
   About 100 Americans were brought home over the weekend.
   Earlier today, Bush met with his Cabinet for a post-vacation
briefing on the gulf crisis.
   The president, returning to the capital just five days before he
holds his third summit with Gorbachev, also was dispatching two top
aides to solicit donations from wealthy allies to cover expenses of
the U.S. military operation in the gulf region.
   ``We are going to have to expect more cooperation from the 22
countries that are participating in this effort,'' Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., the chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, said today.
   Rostenkowski, who returned from Saudi Arabia Monday night, also
said on ``CBS This Morning'' that Americans are ``just going to
have to recognize the fact that sacrifice is going to be necessary.
... I think we're going to have to raise revenues, cut spending, be
a little more prudent about the way we spend our defense dollars.''
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., appearing with Rostenkowski, echoed
the call for more international support. ``We've got to focus on a
number of things and one is the burden-sharing issue. We must get
more of our allies there, in greater numbers.''
   Levin said the morale of U.S. troops ``is very, very high.'' But
he said they are in an ``extraordinarily difficult environment''
and are getting ``no mail yet, no newspapers, no cigarettes. We're
going to have to worry about rotation and relief for some of our
forces.''
   A delegation of 22 House members returned to Washington on
Monday night after touring the Persian Gulf region and inspecting
the U.S. military operation that has been rushed in since Iraq's
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., the House majority leader, told
reporters at Andrews Air Force Base, Md: ``All of us left here with
the conclusion that the president's action was a correct action.
All of us come back believing that is the case.''
   But, Gephardt added, ``We need more help, especially from our
NATO allies, to have troops on the ground with ours.'' He said the
bipartisan delegation also ``firmly believes that the financial
burden of supporting multilateral military deployments in the
Persian Gulf area must be shared equitably.''
   Baker leaves Thursday for Saudi Arabia and the gulf region to
solicit financial contributions to bolster the U.S. effort and also
to provide economic assistance to countries hard hit by the embargo
against Iraq. He also planned stops in West Germany and Italy.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady was setting out on a similar
mission today to Paris, London, Seoul and Tokyo.
   Bush announced last week that he wants to enlist the wealthy
nations of the world to help pay the $1 billion per month in U.S.
costs for military might mustered against Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.

<HEAD>Palestinian Uprising Marks 1,000 Days</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN ALT POWELL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   When an army truck broke
down recently in the middle of this West Bank town, Palestinian
teen-agers sprang into action.
   ``They trashed it,'' said an Israeli army officer who witnessed
the scene. ``They broke every window, smashed every door and
fender.''
   The incident was a reminder that the Palestinian revolt against
Israeli occupation, though eclipsed by the gulf crisis, persists as
an angry war of stones and empty bottles against well-armed Israeli
troops.
   The uprising, known in Arabic as the ``intefadeh,'' marks its
1,000th day Wednesday. The PLO-backed underground leadership of the
revolt called for the anniversary to be marked with protest marches
under the banner ``Intefadeh until a Palestinian state.''
   That goal remains illusive for the 1.7 million Palestinians in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and the character of the
struggle is changing amid a more restrained Israeli military policy
and the impact of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   Palestinian support for Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein has
disappointed the United States and other Western nations that tried
to mediate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
   ``There's no doubt that Israel is reaping political gains from
the gulf crisis,'' said Ghassan Khatib, a Palestinian professor
from this town just north of Jerusalem.
   ``There are fewer pressures on Israel from the United States to
start a dialogue with the Palestinians,'' Khatib said. ``There is
no more talk about Israeli violations of human rights in the
occupied territories.''
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Tuesday dismissed
reporters' questions about the anniversary.
   ``It doesn't have any impact on the progress of the Jewish
people and the Jewish state,'' Shamir said.
   Since the revolt began in December 1987, a total of 728
Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians. In
addition, 255 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs, most
on suspicion of collaboration with Israel. Forty-seven Israelis
have died.
   In recent months, according to both Palestinians and Israeli
army officials, there has been a marked slowdown in the uprising.
   Under Defense Minister Moshe Arens, the army since June has
reduced its forces in heavily populated areas and tightened firing
rules, sharply reducing Palestinian casualties.
   In the past three months, 11 Palestinians have died from Israeli
army gunfire. In the same period last year, the toll was 77.
   ``It reflects more experience by the army in handling the
situation,'' said an army spokesman, who cannot be identified by
name under military rules. ``Troops are positioned so there is less
friction with the local population.''
   Meanwhile, the Palestinian side shows signs of fatigue from the
almost weekly general strikes ordered by uprising leaders and
forced closures by the army.
   ``Our business barely feeds our family,'' said Zaki Musleh, a
60-year-old carpenter with a shop on Ramallah's Palestine Street.
``No one has any money.''
   Musleh's shop, like many others, is short one worker. His
28-year-old son Bassam is in army custody, one of more than 910
Palestinians held without charge or trial under military
``administrative detention'' rules.
   Some 9,015 other Palestinians also are in jail, charged or
awaiting trial or sentenced for anti-Israeli crimes, the army says.
   Palestinians remain resilient despite the revolt's failure to
achieve its main political goal of getting the Israelis out of the
territories they seized in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Palestinian journalist Daoud Kuttab said he believes the main
achievement of the intefadeh has been a change in Palestinian
attitudes.
   ``Palestinians are no longer thinking as an occupied people.
They are thinking as a people resisting occupation,'' he said.
``That is why the uprising will continue.''
   In Ramallah's Kadura refugee camp, 29-year-old truck driver Ziad
Zmekna points to greater international awareness of the
Palestinians' plight as another gain from the uprising.
   Zmekna's life is a measure of Palestinian determination. One of
his brothers is jailed, another is hiding from authorities, and
Zmekna himself has lost his driver's license for failure to pay
income taxes to the Israelis.
   He points to a photo on his wall, the wedding portrait of a
Palestinian friend killed by Israeli troops last year.
   ``The intefadeh will continue for our martyrs, it will continue
for us,'' Zmekna said. ``This is our national duty.''

   The National Institutes of Health announced
today that scientists have isolated the gene responsible for
osteoarthritis, a painful, crippling disease that affects about 16
million Americans.
   Dr. Darwin J. Prockop of Philadelphia's Thomas Jefferson
University and Dr. Roland W. Moskowitz of Case Western Reserve
University in Cleveland led the scientists who isolated a flawed
gene that normally helps make collagen, a protein that strengthens
joints.
   The scientists studied genetic material from 19 members of a
three-generation family and found that the faulty gene was
affecting the family members as young as 16.
   Osteoarthritis leads to a wearing away of joints and serious
cases of severe crippling. It can affect the hands, feet, hips and
knees.
   Identifying the gene, officials said, may lead to new treatments
and even prevention.
   ``Understanding genetic mechanisms underlying osteoarthritis may
give us the potential to intervene early in a painful, disabling
disease,'' said Dr. James O. Mason, assistant secretary of health.

   The Soviets on Tuesday proposed an international
conference to discuss the Persian Gulf crisis, the Arab-Israeli
dispute and the Lebanese civil war.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir reiterated his opposition
to discussing the Palestinian issue at an international conference,
but he welcomed the idea of a conference on the Persian Gulf.
   A spokesman for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev declined to say
how hard he will press the issue at the summit with President Bush
on Sunday.
   ``The Soviet president intends to discuss ... ways of defusing
the Persian Gulf crisis, and he believes that all efforts,
including those of a mediator, are viewed positively in the Soviet
Union,'' presidential spokesman Vitaly N. Ignatenko told a news
conference.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze proposed the conference
earlier in the day during a speech in Vladivostok, in the Soviet
Far East. Shevardnadze said the summit in Helsinki, Finland, ``will
mark a major milestone on the road toward resolving the crisis in
the Persian Gulf.''
   But he said that ``after one more look at the situation, we
still have come to the same conclusion'' that an international
conference on the Middle East is necessary. He stressed that in the
meantime, efforts to bring about a settlement of the Persian Gulf
situation under U.N. auspices should continue.
   The Soviet Union voted for a U.N. Security Council embargo
against Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 and has given
lukewarm support to U.S. Navy actions to enforce the sanctions.
   This is a departure from the Kremlin's historic stance. In the
past, it shipped arms to militant Arab states, including Iraq; was
hostile to Israel; and supported the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   Shevardnadze criticized the previous arms sales to Iraq, which
ended after the invasion, and said the Soviet Union might
re-examine its relations with Israel. But he also linked solution
of the Persian Gulf crisis to the Palestinian issue, as well as to
the civil war in Lebanon.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein at one point proposed that a
pullout of his troops from Kuwait be contingent upon an Israeli
withdrawal from the occupied territories. The United States
rejected the plan.
   ``At this point in time, there is a growing awareness ... that a
complex of problems involving the Arab-Israeli conflict, the fate
of the Palestinians and the tragedy in Lebanon awaits its
resolution in the Middle East,'' Shevardnadze said in his speech,
which was carried by the state news agency Tass.
   ``Presumably, Israel's agreement to its (a conference's)
convocation could exert a positive influence on the overall
situation in the Middle East and on efforts to defuse the crisis in
the Persian Gulf,'' he said.
   ``For its part, the Soviet Union ... might take a fresh look at
the issue of Soviet-Israeli relations,'' Shevardnadze added.
   The Soviet Union and Israel have not had diplomatic relations
since the 1967 Middle East War, although both countries have been
moving closer in recent months.
   In Jerusalem, Shamir said in response to the proposal: ``On the
subject of the Persian Gulf, yes.''
   He continued: ``We have our position about an international
conference around the solution of the Israeli-Arab conflict. We
will not participate in such an international conference.''
   Israel has vehemently opposed Soviet ideas to hold an
international conference to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Ignatenko, while declining to disclose what proposals Gorbachev
might make at the summit, read a statement saying that: ``The
president of the U.S.S.R. attaches great importance to the
forthcoming Helsinki meeeting.''
   ``Mikhail Gorbachev will use this meeting as a continuation of
contacts to maintain the spirit of the Malta meeting, and the
Washington meeting,'' he said referring to summits last December
and June.
   ``It is going to be a working meeting to discuss a great host of
international topics and bilateral relations,'' he said.
   Gorbachev and Shevardnadze are to travel to Helsinki on Saturday
evening and return on Sunday night said Ignatenko, denying rumors
the summit might last an additional day. The two leaders will
address a joint news conference at the conclusion of their talks,
he said.
   ``The agenda of the meeting will include discussions of the
crisis in the Persian Gulf. The president of the U.S.S.R. and the
Soviet leadership have their own information about state of affairs
in the Persian Gulf area and this issue is under discussion with
leaders of the Persian Gulf and Arab states, as well as Western
European countries with whom we maintain ... close relationships,''
he said.

   Supreme Court nominee David H. Souter today
received the highest rating from the American Bar Association's
judicial screening panel, the Justice Department said.
   Souter received a unanimous ``well qualified'' rating from the
American Bar Association's Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary,
according to a letter from the panel to the Justice Department.
   Souter, a former member of the New Hampshire Supreme Court, was
nominated by President Bush in July for the vacancy created by the
retirement of Justice William Brennan.
   ``The president is pleased to receive this news and looks
forward to a speedy confirmation,'' White House press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater said.
   ``We'd like to see hearings start as soon as possible, and
hopefully, he'll be in place for the new court,'' Fitzwater added.
   Souter received a similar ``well qualified'' rating earlier this
year when he was nominated for a seat on the 1st U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in Boston. He took the federal bench last spring but has
not heard any cases.
   The 15-member ABA committee rates judicial nominees either ``not
qualified,'' ``qualified'' or ``well qualified'' but applies
different standards to evaluate candidates for district, appellate
and Supreme Court judgeships.
   The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to open hearings on
Souter's nomination on Sept. 13.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh hailed the ABA's decision,
saying it confirmed that ``President Bush has selected a man of
superb intellect and qualifications.
   ``I look forward to a speedy confirmation by the United States
Senate,'' Thornburgh said.
   In 1987, four members of the ABA panel dissented from the
committee's finding that Judge Robert Bork was ``well qualified''
for the Supreme Court. These members found Bork, then a federal
appellate judge, to be ``not qualified'' for the high court while a
fifth member voted ``not opposed'' to Bork's confirmation.
   Bork's nomination was turned down by the Senate following a
bitter fight led by a coalition of civil rights and abortion rights
activists.

   Former Sen. Lawton Chiles, who quit politics saying
he was burned out but then launched a comeback attacking big-money
politics, sought Florida's Democratic gubernatorial nomination
Tuesday against Rep. Bill Nelson.
   Republican Gov. Bob Martinez, showing a dramatic comeback in
recent polls, faced four GOP challengers led by state Sen. Marlene
Woodson Howard. Martinez needed more than 50 percent of the primary
vote to avoid a runoff.
   In Nevada, Acting Gov. Bob Miller, who inherited his job without
being elected two years ago, was heavily favored over five
Democratic challengers. Eight Republicans competed for the
gubernatorial nomination, led by Jim Gallaway, a relative newcomer
to the state who said Miller had shown ``a total lack of
leadership.''
   Heading to a general election both parties consider a political
watershed for Florida, voters also faced primaries for four state
Cabinet races that included impeached former federal judge Alcee
Hastings' bid for the Democratic nomination to oppose Republican
incumbent Secretary State Jim Smith.
   Hastings, removed from the bench by U.S. Senate trial after he
was acquitted by a jury of bribery charges, faced ex-Klansman John
Paul Rogers and former newspaperman Jim Minter.
   Two counties had controversial referendums. In Broward County,
voters were considering whether to approve an ordinance protecting
homosexuals against discrimination. In Sarasota, voters were
deciding whether to order a two-year moratorium on growth.

   Republicans have been on a roll in Florida, giving George Bush
his biggest vote total in 1988, electing Republican Connie Mack to
replace Chiles as senator, and grabbing an unprecedented 11-8 lead
in the congressional delegation.
   Democrats said Martinez, whose negative ratings have been high,
offered them a chance to turn things around. But a statewide
television blitz emphasizing Martinez as a law-and-order governor
and family man helped him move to nearly even with Chiles in polls
released last week.
   Republicans hope to hold the governor's mansion and grab command
of the state Senate in November, putting them in position to
control redistricting in 1992 that will include at least three new
congressional seats in this fast-growing state.
   Chiles, 60, said he entered the race last April because he felt
the campaign was being dominated by big money. He voluntarily
limited donations to $100 each, rejected political action committee
contributions, and said he took his inspiration from Eastern
Europe's revolutions.
   Chiles said rejecting big money will allow him to govern
unencumbered by special interests, and he hoped the movement could
spread nationally.
   But Chiles, a moderate with one of the highest reputations in
politics for ethics, was dogged by questions about his mental
health. He retired from the Senate when his third term ended in
January 1989, saying he was burned out. At the time he was chairman
of the Senate Budget Committee.
   He later was diagnosed as depressed and began using the drug
Prozac. He stopped using it early in his campaign, but resumed
taking the anti-depressant last month.
   His running mate is Kenneth ``Buddy'' MacKay, former three-term
congressman who narrowly lost to Mack in 1988.
   Nelson, 47, claimed to have more energy and vision to lead the
state. The Melbourne congressman, known for a 1986 space shuttle
mission, began planning his gubernatorial bid nearly three years
ago.
   He was the Democratic front-runner until Chiles' surprise entry
in April. Initial polls gave Chiles a 50-point or more lead over
Nelson, but the congressman came back with an aggressive effort
that claimed Chiles was too vague, lacked energy, and wasn't as
pure on ethics as believed.
   Nelson's campaign suffered a late setback when his running mate,
state House Speaker Tom Gustafson, was widely criticized and
finally apologized after suggesting Chiles might be suicidal.
   Martinez, 55, only Florida's second Republican governor since
Reconstruction, was hurt his first year by backing a sales services
tax he later helped repeal. He also stirred controversy last year
by calling a special legislative session for what turned out to be
an unsuccessful effort to further restrict abortion.
   Chiles and Nelson favored abortion rights, as did Martinez
opponent Woodson Howard.
   The Broward referendum was opposed by the Roman Catholic
Archdiocese of Miami and by critics who warned its passage would
bring more gays and AIDS to the country.
   In Sarasota, supporters said a two-year moratorium on new
structures would give time to improve services and address other
problems of growth; opponents said a halt would put thousands out
of work and damage the economy.

   Two inmates at the prison where Manuel Noriega is
being held dodged bullets to scale a fence and escape through the
woods behind the institution, but they were captured early today, a
prison officer said.
   The ousted Panamanian dictator, under constant watch by a guard
posted outside his specially built cell at the federal Metropolitan
Correctional Center, wasn't involved.
   Omar Fernandez of Miami and Charles Carew of Brockton, Mass.,
were spotted climbing a fence late Monday night, said prison
spokesman Charles Davis.
   ``Our perimeter patrolman fired on the inmates and claims he hit
one on the shoulder,'' Davis said.
   Police and prison authorities surrounded the complex and
searched with dogs and with helicopters, one of them equipped with
infrared lights for night vision.
   Prison officials said the two were traveling together but were
captured separately on foot about 3 miles from the prison about
3:30 this morning.
   The dogs first tracked down Carew, 28, on a four-lane road
southeast of the institution, but Fernandez, 24, got away, said
associate warden Mike Stone. An hour later, police found Fernandez
about two blocks away in a small subdivision, Stone said.
   The two escapees suffered minor cuts from the prison's razor
wire and one was bitten by a dog, Stone said.
   Carew, awaiting trial on cocaine possession charges, and
Fernandez, charged in a bank robbery, apparently intended to make
off in a sports car police believe was left for them in the prison
parking lot with the keys inside. But the car would not start,
authorities said.
   Many inmates at the medium-security prison 25 miles from Miami
are allowed relative freedom inside the wooded, 48-acre compound.
   The prison was built for 425 inmates but now holds more than
1,100.
   Last year, security was tightened after an unsuccessful
helicopter escape bid by drug smuggler Barry Kramer. The pilot and
Kramer, a former powerboat racing champion serving life without
parole, were injured when the chopper crashed into the exercise
yard fence on takeoff.
   Since 1981, there have been three successful escapes from the
prison, Davis said.
   One prisoner, wearing makeup and his wife's clothes, walked out
the door with visitors. Another, caught two years later, hung onto
the undercarriage of a bookmobile.
   The third inmate briefly made it out hiding in a trash bin. He
narrowly escaped being crushed.

   Class clowns around the country are returning to
school armed with a new tool for teacher torture: ``Spit Wads,'' a
high-tech version of the old-fashioned spitball.
   ``You can't stand in the way of progress,'' inventor Ted Skup
said, tongue in cheek.
   ``It sounds simple, but try developing one,'' said Skup, who
created the wads after a year's worth of sticky, slippery research.
   So what does this invention mean to the average underachieving
student with $1.29 to spend?
   No more telltale straws or messy clumps of unused, well-chewed
paper, for one thing, because you don't spit ``Spit Wads,'' you
toss them. You get a quarter-ounce of a light blue non-toxic
compound, enough for several traditional-size spitballs. The
material is described as a polymeric improvement on the original
spitball that won't stain when stuck.
   ``I threw a lot of stuff at the walls which never came off when
I was developing this,'' said Skup, 38, of Schererville, Ind.
``There's still a lot of marks on my wall.''
   Skup came up with the idea during a lunch break from his job as
a refinery worker. After a year's worth of experiments with every
glue, paste and adhesive he could find, Skup produced the space-age
spitballs and trademarked the ``Spit Wads'' name for the gum-like
clumps.
   ``I was lucky to get that,'' he said proudly. ``That's my own
personal trademark for the next 20 years.''
   Skup brought his creation to an old soccer-playing buddy,
soon-to-be financial backer Scott Hicko. Both vividly recall that
day of destiny this past March.
   ``Once I threw it against the wall and it stuck, I sold him. You
don't need a big presentation when the guy starts laughing for an
hour,'' said Skup.
   ``I've seen products all my life, been in business for 20 years,
and seen a lot of gimmicks. Something hit me with this _ nostalgia,
maybe the old troublemaker in me,'' said Hicko.
   Hicko is not the only one with a misspent youth; Skup quickly
announces he was voted class clown in high school. Both were
surprised the product has been as popular among adults as with
children.
   ``It touches something in everybody. Everybody knows what a spit
wad is,'' said Hicko. ``I mean, we thought our market was 7 to 12
year olds. We go into corporate offices and they go nuts _
everybody is flicking 'em at pictures of the boss.''
   Groups dedicated to policing the school system said it was too
soon to assess the impact of the spitball of the '90s.
   ``This is the first we've heard of this. We'd have to get a
little more information,'' said Stacey Moore, spokeswoman for the
National Parents &amp; Teachers Association. ``I sure can't recall any
product like that.''
   But Skup is hopeful his product will soon become as popular as
the Pet Rock or the mood ring.
   ``There hasn't been a good fad in a really long time. I mean,
Bart Simpson and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?'' asked Skup.
``We're hoping to jump in with something really off the wall.''

<TEXT>
   President Franklin D. Roosevelt's yacht,
often called ``the floating White House,'' is on its way to
becoming a floating museum.
   The 165-foot Potomac has had numerous owners, including Elvis
Presley. It once chased Prohibition rum runners and finally was
docked for alleged drug trafficking.
   Now, it's being restored by the Potomac Association for the
latest owner, the Port of Oakland, with careful attention to detail.
   ``It has to be as close as possible to what the president had,''
said Syrell Sapoznick, a spokeswoman for the association.
   Project manager Dan Holdgate has the paneling to the pilot house
in his garage where he works on it during evenings and weekends.
   He spent 200 hours refurbishing a dish rack of Honduran mahogany
and when a search for special hand cranks came up dry, Holdgate
made them himself and had them chromed.
   ``There's nobody else to do it,'' Holdgate said.
   Paul Harless, a Navy veteran who served as a petty officer on
the Potomac from 1940 to 1942, is the source of much detail. He
even recalled the size of the sandbox for FDR's dog Fala: 18 inches
high, 3 feet square and filled two-thirds with sand.
   ``The dog had the run of the ship, but it wasn't a favorite of
the crew,'' Harless said.
   The boat originally served as a Coast Guard cutter, and pursued
liquor smugglers.
   Congressmen and heads of state met with Roosevelt on the ship
after he took it as his personal yacht in 1936. He broadcast one of
his fireside chats from the ship.
   It also served as a personal retreat for Roosevelt, an avid
fisherman and former assistant secretary of the Navy who called
boats his avocation.
   The state of Maryland bought it for use by its governor at the
end of World War II and it later went into private ownership.
   In 1980, it was linked to drug trafficking and seized by the
Customs Service. While impounded at Treasure Island, the boat hit
pilings and sank in about 30 feet of water.
   The Port of Oakland bought it for $15,000 in 1981.

<HEAD>Westerners Arrive From Baghdad Aboard Iraqi Planes</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Combines previous. No pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scores of Western nationals, including 135
West Germans, arrived in the Jordanian capital today aboard two
Iraqi Airways jetliners.
   The first flight, which landed at Queen Alia International
airport, brought 170 foreigners, mostly Arabs and Asians. There was
one Englishwoman among them, Georgina Rose, with her two children,
Jemeela, 18 months, and Sheherazade, 6 months. Rose is married to
an Iraqi citizen.
   The second plane, which landed two hours later, had 135 West
Germans, plus some New Zealanders, Irishmen and some other Western
citizens, according to airport officials.
   A British embassy official said 45 Britons were expected on a
third flight. A U.S. Embassy spokesman said there would also be a
number of Americans on the plane, but added that he was not sure
how many.
   The arriving westerners were taken immediately to the airport
transit lounge and reporters were not allowed to speak to them.
Airport officials told him that they would leave for Frankfurt,
West Germany later in the day on a Lufthansa jetliner.
   Earlier today, a British-organized convoy of about 300 women and
children left Kuwait to drive across the desert to Baghdad, and
authorities said a planeload of Westerners might be allowed to
leave for Jordan on a U.S.-chartered Iraqi Airways flight.
   Meanwhile, Iraqi authorities said the United States was to blame
if captive foreigners went hungry as a result of food shortages
caused by the international economic sanctions against Iraq.
   Iraq has said that Western women and children trapped by the
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait will be permitted to leave, but Western
men are being used as human shields to protect Iraqi installations
against potential attack.
   More than 700 Western hostages _ women, children and a few
ailing men _ have left, but the departures of others have been
complicated by Iraq's refusal to allow foreign airlines to land in
Baghdad and by long delays in processing their exit permits by
Iraqi authorities.
   About 11,000 Westerners are now believed stranded in Kuwait and
Iraq.
   Some evacuees have traveled across the desert to Jordan in the
scorching summer heat. The British-organized convoy left Kuwait at
dawn today, British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd told reporters
in Ta'if, Saudi Arabia, where he was meeting with the deposed
Kuwaiti government.
   They were headed for Baghdad in seven buses and a car, he said,
and hoped to travel out of Iraq from there.
   The foreign secretary said 148 women and 150 children were on
the 500-mile trip. In Britain, William Waldegrave, the
second-ranking official in the Foreign Office, put the figure at
148 women and 155 children.
   A Foreign Office spokesman said later that the convoy had been
organized for British citizens, but it was not known whether some
people of other nationalities were traveling with the group.
   The Foreign Office had estimated earlier that the bus convoy
would take 10 to 12 hours to reach Baghdad. Waldegrave, however,
noted that a previous convoy from Kuwait needed 28 hours to
complete its journey.
   ``Our hopes are that we can then get exit visas for them and
probably, on what the Iraqis are saying at the moment, we would
have to hire an Iraqi airplane perhaps to fly them to Amman, or
perhaps straight home if we can,'' Waldegrave said in an interview
with BBC radio.
   A Virgin Atlantic Boeing 747 arrived today in Amman, carrying
relief supplies for Jordan, which has been overwhelmed by a human
tide of Asian and Arab refugees from Iraq and Kuwait. In Jordan,
the flight was to pick up 150 British citizens and 250 Egyptians
who had left Iraq and Kuwait, the airline said. It was not clear
when those people had gotten out of Iraq.
   West Germany said 98 of its stranded women and children have
arrived in Baghdad after an overland trip from Kuwait on Monday.
Twenty-four Italians also made it by road to Baghdad, where sharp
shortages in food supplies were reported in recent days.
   Iraqi authorities say foreigners are sharing the deprivations
imposed on Iraqis because of the U.N.'s economic sanctions against
Iraq. An Iraqi Foreign Ministry spokesman said thousands of
expatriates were going hungry because of the food shortages.
   The official Iraqi News Agency quoted the spokesman as saying a
number of foreign governments had asked to send food to their
nationals trapped in Iraq, but that they were prevented from doing
so by the United States ``which is insisting on tightening its
inhuman blockade.''
   ``Therefore, we deem it necessary to explain that Iraq is in no
way responsible for the starvation of these people as the United
States shoulders full responsibility for their agony,'' the
unidentified spokesman said. The dispatch was monitored in Nicosia,
Cyprus.

   ``Today'' co-host Deborah Norville told viewers
this morning that she's pregnant and her baby is due in March.
   Norville, who in January became Bryant Gumbel's co-host on the
NBC show, is married to Karl Wellner, a Swedish businessman who is
in the auction business, according to NBC.
   Norville, 32, didn't say how long she planned to continue
working, or how much time she might take away from the show after
her child is born.
   The ``Today'' show has been struggling in the morning ratings,
and NBC revamped the program in June by adding Joe Garagiola, Faith
Daniels and Katie Couric to the team of Norville, Gumbel, Willard
Scott and Gene Shalit.
   Norville was added to the lineup last summer in a series of
changes that led to the departure of co-host Jane Pauley in
December.
   The network announced Friday that Garagiola would be off for
four weeks to have elective surgery for an undisclosed medical
problem.

   Iraq has asked Western countries whose citizens it holds to
urgently send food for them, increasing concern that Saddam Hussein
may not intend to free all remaining women and children hostages as
promised.
   The request was yet another sign that Iraq is feeling the crunch
from the trade embargo ordered by the United Nations after Iraq's
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. Iraq also suspended payments on its
foreign debt on Monday.
   More Westerners made it out of Iraq today. Two Iraqi Airways
jetliners carried in Amman. The first flight brought mostly Arabs
and Asians, but one Englishwoman and her two children were aboard.
The second plane carried 135 West Germans, plus some New
Zealanders, Irishmen and some other Western citizens, according to
airport officials.
   A British embassy official said 45 Britons were expected on a
third flight. A U.S. Embassy spokesman said there would also be a
number of Americans on the plane, but added that he was not sure
how many.
   In the Persian Gulf waters, meanwhile, U.S. Coast Guardsmen
boarded the Iraqi-flagged freighter Zanoobia in the Gulf of Oman
today in line with the tightening embargo on Iraqi trade, naval and
shipping sources said.
   It would be the first reported case of U.S. forces boarding an
Iraqi-flagged vessel since the U.N. embargo was imposed on Iraq
last month.
   Also today, Jordan's crown prince criticized the international
community for doing little to help thousands of Asian refugees from
Iraq and Kuwait, some of whom are dying from exposure in a squalid
makeshift camp in the desert while they await transport home.
   In the Soviet Union, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
proposed an international conference on the gulf crisis that would
also take up the Arab-Israeli conflict and the civil war in Lebanon.
   In a major foreign policy address, Shevardnadze also said
Sunday's superpower summit in Helsinki, Finland, would mark ``a
major milestone on the road toward resolving the crisis in the
Persian Gulf.''
   In another development, Iraq suggested setting up an
international ``people's court'' to try President Bush for defiling
Islam and for human rights violations. The state-run Iraqi News
Agency said today the idea was discussed by the nation's union for
lawyers and human rights association.
   The West looked in vain over the weekend for large-scale,
follow-up flights after hundreds of Western and Japanese women and
children were allowed to leave on Iraqi jetliners on Saturday.
   But a convoy carrying about 300 British women and children left
Kuwait City just after dawn heading for Baghdad, where they hoped
to continue overland to Jordan or fly home via Amman, British
officials said.
   Some of the evacuees have acted as human shields at strategic
Iraqi sites on orders of Saddam, who last week said women and
children would be allowed to leave. About 3,000 Americans _ a third
of them women and children _ were among 21,000 Westerners initially
trapped in Iraq and Kuwait by the invasion.
   On Monday, the Iraqi News Agency quoted remarks made by Iraq's
foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, to President Cornelio Sommaruga of
the International Committee of the Red Cross regarding foreigners
inside Iraq.
   ``Suffering as it is from the effects of the international
siege, Iraq will not be responsible for their suffering resulting
from the shortages in food supplies,'' Aziz said.
   He urged countries with large number of citizens in Iraq to
``take urgent measures'' to send those citizens food supplies.
   Iraq rescinded landing rights for foreign charters into Iraq to
pick up foreign nationals, and some sources said Baghdad was
seeking to swap hostages for trade, apparently in an attempt to
poke holes in the embargo.
   Japan's Kyodo News Service said Iraq was asking Tokyo to bend
the embargo in exchange for freeing Japanese hostages.
   In Paris, the Foreign Ministry indicated Iraq had set conditions
unacceptable to France in return for landing rights that would
allow a French plane to repatriate 200 women and children.
   In Baghdad earlier today, Western diplomats were negotiated
frantically with officials at Iraq's Interior and Foreign
Ministries to obtain exit permits for a group of 138 foreign women
and children who want to leave on the Iraqi Airways flight,
diplomatic sources and airline officials reported.
   One Western diplomatic source said 24 Americans are among those
trying to leave on that flight. The others are Britons, Canadians,
Italians, French and Irish nationals, he said, but could not
provide a breakdown.
   In Baghdad, an official at the U.S. Embassy said the Iraqi pane
was chartered by the U.S. government.
   Late Monday, an Iraqi Airways jumbo jet carrying Iraqis stranded
in Britain by the crisis left London for Baghdad. An airline
official said 195 passengers were aboard.
   More than 100,000 Asians _ Indians, Sri Lankans, Bangladeshis,
Thais and Filipinos _ remain stranded in Jordan.
   Some are stuck in a squalid, makeshift camp in the no man's land
just inside Jordan because authorities at the border post of
Ruweishid, swamped by the human tide, has not been able to process
them.
   Crown Prince Hassan, brother of King Hussein, today appealed for
immediate aid. ``We should not forget that the situation, critical
as it is, may be only the tip of the iceberg,'' he told a news
conference.
   On Monday, the Iraqi News Agency quoted Mohammed Mahdi Saleh,
acting minister of commerce and finance, as saying Iraq had
suspended payments on its foreign debt, estimated at $30 billion to
$35 billion.
   Most of that is owed to the United States, Britain, France, the
Soviet Union, West Germany and Japan for purchases of weapons,
technology and food.
   The news agency quoted Saleh as saying the debt suspension would
have adverse effects on countries and companies ``incapable of
withstanding the current situation.'' He was referring to the
economic woes faced by poorer countries that count on trade with
Iraq to generate critical foreign exchange.
   Also Monday, President Bush ended his often-interrupted,
3-week-long vacation in Maine, and returned to Washington to
prepare for the hurriedly arranged summit on Sunday with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The Persian Gulf crisis will be a
major item on the agenda.
   Bush summoned his Cabinet for a briefing on the crisis, and two
congressional teams ended a first-hand look at the situation in the
region.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze today urged the
formation of an international conference on the Persian Gulf crisis
and said Israel's attendance would be important, the official
Soviet news agency, Tass said.
   Shevardnadze, speaking in Vladivostok on his way to Japan, said
Moscow could reconsider Soviet-Israeli relations if Israel agreed
to join such a conference, Tass said. The Soviets severed
diplomatic ties with Israel after the 1967 Middle East war.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is expected in Saudi
Arabia on Friday for talks with officials of the Kuwaiti
government-in-exile. The talks probably will focus on the cost to
the United States of the military operation.
   The U.S. treasury secretary, Nicholas Brady, was to set out on a
similar mission today _ with Paris, London, Seoul and Tokyo as
destinations.
   The United States has deployed about 60,000 troops and dozens of
fighter planes in Saudi Arabia, mostly along the border with Iraq
and Kuwait in response to a perceived Iraqi threat.
   There is also a growing international naval armada in the region.
   Besides Saudi Arabia, several smaller Persian Gulf states are
allowing the United States to base combat aircraft on their soil.
Bahrain, Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar have shed a
traditional reluctance for close military ties with America,
Pentagon sources said Monday.
   In a related development, Turkey's government said Monday it
will seek parliamentary approval to send troops abroad and allow
foreign troops to be stationed in Turkey.

   Police have arrested an Arab on suspicion of
complicity in the 1986 bombing of the La Belle disco that killed
two U.S. soldiers and one Turkish woman, a justice official said
today.
   Cornel Christoffel, spokesman for the West Berlin judicial
authorities, said that a man he identified only as Ali C. had been
detained in East Berlin on Aug. 27 on suspicion of aiding and
abetting murder.
   The powerful early-morning blast April 5, 1986 in the packed
disco, a popular night spot with U.S. solders stationed in West
Berlin, also left more than 200 injured.
   The bombing led to the U.S. air raid on Tripoli and Benghazi in
Libya, after U.S. officials claimed that Libya was involved in the
brutal attack.

   An off-duty policeman was caught in a
drive-by shooting, but escaped with only a scrape when his name tag
deflected a bullet.
   Officer Thomas Thompson was working as a security guard in a
bar. A car drove by and he noticed a passenger roll down a window
and begin firing a pistol at a group of people outside the bar.
   Thompson tried to close the bar's front door and was hit a
glancing blow in the chest by a bullet.
   But the bullet ricocheted off his metal and plastic name tag,
said police spokesman Steve Cole. He suffered only a scrape.
   ``I think that little name tag helped him. It took some of the
impact out,'' said Police Officer Luis Hernandez, who was working
as a guard Sunday with Thompson.
   Another man suffered a leg wound.
   A man and a juvenile were charged with two counts each of
attempted first-degree murder.

   A Kuwaiti army brigade started
maneuvers Tuesday with other Arab forces deployed in Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait's defense minister said.
   The minister, Sheik Nawaf Al-Ahmed al-Sabah, said several
thousand more troops from the Iraqi-occupied emirate, along with
air force and navy units, will join Operation Desert Shield in the
next few weeks.
   He said Kuwait had not put its forces on alert before Saddam
Hussein's tanks invaded Aug. 2 because the government had been
lulled by Iraqi assurances no invasion was imminent.
   Had they been on alert, Kuwait's 20,300-member armed forces
could probably have held out for about four days, he said. As it
was, the Kuwaitis were overwhelmed within hours.
   Sheik Nawaf said Kuwait was fielding about 7,000 troops. Half of
those started maneuvers Tuesday with the joint Arab-Islamic forces
under the command of Lt. Gen. Khaled Bin Sultan of Saudi Arabia.
   The rest are with the Gulf Cooperation Council's rapid
deployment force known as Peninsula Shield based in northern Saudi
Arabia. The GCC is made up of Saudi Arabia, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar,
the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait's government-in-exile, which
has set up headquarters in Saudi Arabia.
   Sheik Nawaf said a team of French technicians was expected in
the kingdom soon with spare parts for the Kuwaiti air force's 15
surviving Mirage F-1 jet fighters. The fighters scrambled the
morning of the invasion and flew to Saudi Arabia after engaging
Iraqi forces, he said.
   Kuwait lost 13 military aircraft _ eight Mirages, two
helicopters and three A-4 Skyhawk ground-attack fighters _ during
the invasion because they were in maintenance hangers when Iraqi
warplanes bombed the air base at Kuwait City, the minister said.
   He said a number of Skyhawks were with Kuwaiti forces in Saudi
Arabia and will join the Mirages under Saudi command. Kuwait had 24
A-4s before the invasion. Other ministers said 24 Kuwaiti
helicopter gunships and transports were taken out of the emirate.
   Most of the Kuwaiti navy, which consists of eight fast attack
boats with anti-ship missiles and a score of coastal patrol boats,
escaped. They will join the swelling armada in the Persian Gulf
region preventing cargo ships from breaking U.N. economic sanctions
against Iraq.
   Sheik Nawaf said about 200 Kuwaiti military men were captured in
the invasion, most of them enlisted men. He gave no casualty
figures.
   Iraq poured about 10 percent of its 1 million-member army over
the border and now has 170,000 troops in Kuwait, he said.
   At the time of the invasion, only 25 percent of the Kuwaiti
armed forces were on duty because the attack came on a Thursday _
the start of the Moslem weekend.
   ``I felt sad. I wished I'd been ready,'' Sheik Nawaf said.

<HEAD>Students Take Novel Approach to Holiday Weekend</HEAD>

   They sat down to computer terminals at
6 p.m. Friday and 48 hours and thousands of sentences later they
got up, proud authors of embryo novels.
   The seven participants in the First Annual Labor Day Weekend
Writing Marathon could boast that they spent the end of their
summer vacation by writing a book _ or at least a rough draft.
   ``It was way past my wildest expectations,'' Westfield State
College English professor Stephen Sossaman said Tuesday. ``We had
seven students who took the project very seriously for the entire
48 hours. They really didn't do anything but write, except for
occasional naps.''
   The novel activity, designed to give students a chance to
unleash their creativity, was inspired by a contest Sossaman read
about in which professional writers competed against each other to
turn out a book in a weekend.
   Three women and four men showed up at Bates Hall with sleeping
bags, toothbrushes, change for pizza, computer discs and
imaginations. They didn't bring notes or outlines.
   Sossaman suggested that they each pick a genre to help them get
going, such as horror or science fiction.
   ``I thought a genre novel is a lot easier to write than the
great American novel,'' he said.
   For hours at a stretch the clacking of keyboards was the only
sound in the room.
   ``It's hard to describe how energizing this experience is even
though the sleeping was a bit tough,'' Sossaman said in a telephone
interview.
   Sophomore J.A. Marshall, who got started with the sentence ``He
put on the dark black gloves and stared at himself in the mirror,''
said he switched from science-fiction to a psychodrama while
tapping out his novel outline.
   ``It was a wonderful experience. We were able to have such a
great block of time to throw into a project,'' he said.
   ``The thing was, you'd start to run out, you'd come to a point
where the fear would start in, the writer's block would start in
and you'd look around you and you'd see everybody else was still
going,'' he said.
   When it was all over at 6 p.m. Sunday, each one ``more or less''
had a novel outline. Sossaman had just about finished a pulp novel
on Vietnam combat.
   ``Everyone wrote quite a bit. No one expressed disappointment.
Obviously you can't write a novel in a weekend, but they made some
progress,'' he said.
   Sophomore Angela Collette, who almost finished an untitled novel
tracing the history of two girls growing up, said she didn't regret
giving up any beach time.
   ``You've had all summer to lie by the pool,'' she said. ``I
meant to write this summer instead of just wasting away.''
   Students and Sossaman said they hope to be back next year.
   ``Some people think I was crazy to do this but ... I like the
idea of creative intensity,'' Sossaman said.

<HEAD>American Workers' Productivity Rebounds 1.5 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The productivity of American workers improved
for the first time in more than a year, climbing in the second
quarter at an annual rate of 1.5 percent, the government said
Tuesday.
   However, analysts said the rebound was still well below the
level needed to significantly boost Americans' living standard.
   In addition, figures showing steep labor cost increases
heightened analysts' concerns that the nation's inflation problems
are worsening, especially in light of the Middle East oil crisis
that threatens to push inflation higher.
   ``It exacerbates the situation, no question about it,'' said
Elliott Platt of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp.
   ``Even before the Iraqi situation, the U.S. economy was facing
an entrenched, underlying labor cost inflation of between 4 and 5
percent. That doesn't allow for any profits,'' added Allen Sinai,
chief economist at the Boston Co.
   The 1.5 percent rise in non-farm productivity _ defined as
output per hour of work _ was the first increase since productivity
climbed 0.5 percent in the final three months of 1988, the Labor
Department said.
   The rebound was a departure from productivity's poor performance
in recent months. Productivity declined 0.3 percent last year, the
worst showing since output fell 0.9 percent during the 1981-82
recession. It had plunged 1.9 percent during the first quarter of
this year, the government said.
   During the April-June period this year, there was no increase in
the number of hours worked. Sinai called that a sign that employers
weren't hiring new workers or letting employees work more hours.
   ``The productivity increase is being eked out by squeezing down
on labor,'' Sinai said. ``It still shows an anemic performance for
U.S. productivity growth. What businesses are doing in light of ...
an anticipated recession is to cut back on jobs and hours worked.''
   Hourly labor costs, a major inflation measure for businesses,
shot up at an annual rate of 5.8 percent for the second quarter of
1990, far above the 3 percent rise for all of 1989.
   Meanwhile, unit labor costs, a key gauge of future price
inflation, rose 4.3 percent for the second quarter, compared with a
3.3 percent rise during all of 1989.
   Increased productivity, or getting each worker to produce more
for each hour he or she works, is vital to increasing Americans'
standard of living without inflation, many economists believe.
   Tuesday's report provided revised figures on the second quarter
of 1990. The 1.5 percent revised increase was slightly below the
1.6 percent increase first reported by the Labor Department.
   In the manufacturing sector, productivity increased 4 percent,
or double the 2 percent rise for all of 1989, Tuesday's report
said. Unit labor costs in that sector rose 2.2 percent, the same as
the 2.2 percent increase during all of last year.
   Total business productivity, including farming, rose 1.7 percent
for the second quarter, compared with a 0.2 percent drop for all of
1989.
   Since 1982, productivity growth has averaged 1.4 percent a year,
a slight improvement over the 1.2 percent average growth rate in
the 1970s but far below the 3.3 percent rate of increase posted in
the two decades after World War II.

<TEXT>
   The harsh
conditions of the Saudi desert are taking a toll on U.S. military
equipment, affecting simple mechanical gear as well as sensitive
high-tech equipment, from M-16 rifles to weapons guidance systems.
   The warships patrolling the waters around the Arabian peninsula
are also have problems, officers and maintenance crews said.
   ``When you buy a stereo, what do the instructions say?'' Marine
Gunnery Sgt. Tate Ingles of Miami asked during a recent interview.
``They say you should keep it away from heat, dust and vibration.
You put the same electrical gear in the Saudi desert, and, well,
there you have it.''
   Because of the heat and sand, weapons systems that rely on
sensitive electronics and computers could be troublesome to operate
if extended hostilities broke out, technicians say.
   At Eagle Forward, a base camp for Apache gunships and other
helicopters of the 101st Airborne Division's air assault brigade,
the soft Saudi sand blown by the desert wind is the big headache.
   ``It's unbelievable. It gets everywhere,'' a maintenance crew
member said.
   Crews are flushing out the Apache engines with water every day
to rid them of the sand. The powdery sand also finds its way into
transmissions and gears that turn the rotors, forcing more frequent
maintenance on those systems as well.
   ``Hovering around in the desert is going to be very hard on the
engines,' said Maj. Greg Maisel, of Laredo, Texas, the executive
officer of a Marine attack squadron.
   Helicopters are being fitted with radiator filters much like the
black wraps often seen on fronts of sports cars.
   ``We were having a lot of overheating problems because of sand
clogging the radiators,'' squadron leader Lt. Col. Don Cody said.
``We think the filters have fixed that.''
   The sand scours the paint from rotor blades, exposing metal that
glints in the sun, making the helicopters easier to spot.
   Sand is the reason the Air Force is cutting the time between its
routine maintenance. Tests and routine adjustments made every 100
hours are now being done every 60-75 hours, an air force official
said.
   One persistent problem is sand clogging air-intake valves of jet
engines. Much like the Apaches, the engines of Air Force and Navy
planes, on the ground and aboard carriers, are being flushed with
water daily.
   A Marine sergeant cleaning his automatic rifle noted:
``Sometimes I'm not sure it would fire if I needed it to. We train
in the desert, but I've never seen anything like this.''
   Tanks need more frequent filter cleanings and track flushing and
higher viscosity oil. Radiators need to be checked constantly to
prevent overheating.
   The sand cakes on headlights and windshields and can get into
the fuel supply if proper care is not taken.
   Weapons systems protected from the sand can't escape the
scorching sun.
   Within days of arriving here, 82nd Airborne units were reporting
dead radios because wires were burned out or fused by the heat.
   One officer in the division said Monday that parts for the
radios and other equipment being damaged are getting hard to come
by. ``We're short quite a few things,'' said the officer, who spoke
on condition of anonymity. ``I'm sure we'll get them eventually.''
   Meantime, ingenuity is helping.
   On Tuesday, two 82nd soldiers were at a Safeway supermarket in a
Saudi town, cleaning it out of sponges and cloth. A vehicle
containing several TOW anti-tank missiles and other weapons
exploded at an 82nd motor pool Monday and the men suspect heat was
a factor.
   The equipment problems are frustrating, but the maintenance
crews try to keep a sense of humor.
   ``Some officer says, `Hey, my radio don't work,''' Ingles said.
   ``I tell him: `Sir, if you'd been sitting out here under a
magnifying glass in 130-degree temperatures all day, you wouldn't
work either.'''

   The pilot of the first aircraft to fly
from California to the East Coast using solar power today called
off his attempt to complete his trip by flying to the site of the
first powered flight.
   Northeast wind in excess of 20 mph forced Eric Raymond to cancel
plans to fly his ultralight craft the remaining nine miles from the
farm where he landed Monday to the First Flight Airport next to the
Wright Brothers Memorial at Kitty Hawk.
   After announcing his plans, Raymond and his wife, Aida, went
windsurfing.
   Reached later by phone, Raymond said wind gusting to 35 mph
Tuesday was ``five times too much'' to fly in.
   He said he feels ``great'' at having completed the
transcontinental trip. ``I don't see the significance of flying the
last nine miles,'' he said.
   ``Tomorrow, he'll set up the plane for anybody who wants to see
it and then head home to California,'' said Nancy McWilliams of
Kitty Hawk Kites, a hang-gliding school and store that has been the
headquarters for the final portion of the trip.
   Sam Raymond, the pilot's father, said he's glad to see the trip
is over, although his son wanted to achieve his goal of flying to
Kitty Hawk.
   ``There's a little bit of disappointment that he didn't get to
the exact landing point that he wanted,'' the elder Raymond said.
   Raymond had frequently faced weather problems during his
month-and-a-half trip.
   His aircraft, the Sun Seeker, depends on sunshine and favorable
wind. Solar cells produce power for its electric motor, which is
used for takeoffs and landings. After takeoff, the plane rides
thermals, columns of rising warm air, like a glider.
   Weather forced Monday's landing at the farm near the small
coastal town of Spot.
   ``No. 1, low visibility'' was the problem, said the elder
Raymond. ``It got down as low as 600 feet and it was raining and a
storm was building. The breezes from the ocean were actually
pushing him back inland.''
   Raymond, 33, first took off July 16 from Desert Center, Calif.,
about 200 miles east of Los Angeles, beginning his quest to prove
an ultralight aircraft partly powered by solar energy could cross
the United States.
   Two days after the journey began, the 198-pound craft was
damaged in an aborted takeoff from Lordsburg, N.M.
   The Sun Seeker, Raymond and his ground crew returned to Lake
Elsinore, Calif., for repairs. Raymond manufactured and sold
hang-gliding equipment there until six months ago, when he devoted
himself to the Sun Seeker project.
   The Sun Seeker had better luck after taking off again from
Desert Center on Aug. 2.
   Raymond, a former national hang gliding champion, had hoped to
reach his destination Sunday but was delayed by strong head wind.
He logged only 18 miles Friday when he landed at Virginia Tech
Airport at Blacksburg, Va., about 25 miles northwest of Roanoke, Va.
   Raymond flew 124 miles Sunday before landing in Currituck, in
North Carolina's northeastern corner, said expedition spokesman
Jack Whitehouse.

   Cries of ``Viva, de
South Africa's president Tuesday when he made an unannounced trip
to this sprawling black township southwest of Johannesburg.
   It was F.W. de Klerk's fir Klerk!' greetedst visit to Soweto since
he became
president last year. His predecessor, P.W. Botha, was the first
South African head of government to enter the country's largest
township, a traditional hotbed of black unrest.
   Since his inauguration, de Klerk has promoted reforms to end the
apartheid system of racial segregation and has opened talks with
the African National Congress on sharing power with the black
majority.
   On Tuesday, he received a warm welcome in the townshsays Milt Berger,
a public relations man who once worked for
Steeplechase and now represents Astroland, Coney Island's only
multiride park.
   And things got worse.
   When Steeplechase owner Frank Tilyou died in 1964, the heirs
wrangled about Steeplechase's operation until, Berger says, ``for
peace and harmony's sake'' they sold it. The buyer was developer
Fred Trump, father of Donald. ``He wanted to put up some big
seaside condo development,'' Berger said.
   Down came the pavilion of fun, and with it the end of a legend.
   But Trump couldn't get the building variance he needed to
construct residential housing in an area zoned for amusement. The
'60s rolled by and Steeplechase sat vacant.
   The city condemned it in 1969; after a court battle Trump
reportedly received $4 million for the 12-acre parcel. About the
same time, the city condemned blocks of red-brick bungalows once
used as summer homes.
   With the '70s came plans to build public-housing projects.
   ``The city had this vision that they would round up a lot of
low-income people from the city and bring them out to Coney Island,
to this paradise,'' says developer Bullard, ``and that once here
all of their problems would be over because they'd be in paradise.''
   Tall, boxy buildings sprang up. Whites fled. Stores closed. The
vacation trade died, nearly taking the entire community with it.
   When the urban renewal projects began, Mermaid Avenue was a
thriving business center with over 400 retail stores. Today, there
are 39.
   Coney Island, says Ann Weisbrod, vice president of the city's
Public Development Corp., was ``the victim of government good
intentions.''
   Now the city has a new slate of plans to revive Coney Island,
among them Bullard's proposed $350 million Steeplechase Park and a
14,000-seat Sportsplex to be used for college and high school
events.
   The proposed new Steeplechase, covering 25 acres, would be a
three-tier park with 65 major attractions, 14 theaters and a $3
million renovated version of the Parachute Jump.
   There are also plans to renovate the subway stop, repave local
streets, rebuild bridges leading onto Coney Island and turn
Stillwell Avenue into a pedestrian mall.
   The city has committed $20 million to the project. ``That's just
about enough to build the parking garage,'' says Bullard.
   If all goes well, Steeplechase could open in 1993. If approved,
the Sportsplex project, which is still in the development stage,
could be operating by 1995.
   ``You'll never be able to recapture the glory days of old Coney
Island,'' says state Sen. Marty Solomon, who represents the area.
``But these projects are giving an awful lot of hope to an area
that hasn't had any for a long, long time.''

<TEXT>
   The deposed Kuwaiti government Tuesday
promised to pay compensation to more than 150,000 of its citizens
living in exile as a result of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   Before the invasion on Aug. 2, Kuwaitis enjoyed one of the
world's highest per capita incomes, estimated at about $20,000 a
year.
   Despite the reported looting of Kuwait's financial institutions
by Iraq, the oil-rich government that was led by Sheik Jaber
al-Ahmed al-Sabah still has an estimated $100 billion in assets
available to it outside the occupied nation.
   There are an estimated 150,000 Kuwaitis living in Saudi Arabia
and the government-in-exile's official radio station reported
Tuesday that Kuwaiti heads of families there will receive a monthly
allowance of $320.
   Separate monthly payments of $160 will be provided to other
family members above the age of 21, with half that amount going to
those younger.
   In addition, families of five or less will get monthly housing
allowances of $400, while those of more than five will get $530.
   Family heads will also receive a one-time cash payment of
$1,330, said the radio announcement, broadcast from somewhere in
Saudi Arabia.
   Kuwaiti exiles in other gulf countries will be paid according to
the cost of living there. No mention was made of Kuwaitis living
outside the Middle East.
   The emir and his government are now based in exile in the Saudi
Arabian mountain resort town of Taif. They decided on the living
subsidies at a Monday Cabinet meeting, the radio said.
   Prior to the Iraqi invasion, 1.8 million people lived in Kuwait,
but only 800,000 were citizens of the nation.
   The remainder came from more than 100 nations to bolster the
labor force. Most did menial jobs or worked in the construction
industry.
   Foreigners also served with the military and police.
   The government announcement said if non-Kuwaiti military
personnel are ``at the front,'' their families will receive a
stipend of $450 a month.
   The same amount is being given to each Kuwaiti national on
active duty in the military.
   Half of the 7,000 Kuwaiti troops that are still active are
serving with a joint Arab-Islamic forces under Saudi commmand. The
rest are part of the Gulf Cooperation Council's Rapid Deployment
Force, also based in Saudi Arabia.
   The government announcement said Kuwaitis put up by the Saudi
government in schools, stadiums and other public facilities had to
move to permanent lodgings to become eligible for the allowances.

   Lawrence A. Cremin, a Pulitzer Prize-winning
historian who spent 23 years writing a definitive trilogy on
American public education, died Tuesday. He was 64.
   Cremin died of a heart attack, according to a statement from
Teachers College, Columbia University.
   Cremin, a New York City resident, was president of Teachers
College from 1974 to 1984 and was the Frederick A.P. Barnard
Professor of Education at the college.
   Since 1985, he was president of the Chicago-based Spencer
Foundation, whose major priority is educational research. He was a
member of the foundation's board of directors since 1973.
   Cremin also was a founding member of the National Academy of
Education and served as its president from 1969-73.
   Cremin won the Pulitzer Prize for history in 1981 for ``American
Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876,'' the second volume
of a three-volume history of U.S. schools from colonial times
through 1980. The final volume, ``American Education: The
Metropolitan Experience 1876-1980,'' was published in 1988.
   His most recent work, published last spring, was ``Popular
Education and Its Discontents,'' which offered philosophical
answers to the question of how U.S. schools developed as they did.
He argued that the current school crisis stems not so much from the
``mediocrity'' of schools or educators, but from outside forces
that are overburdening schools with more and more demands.
   At the time of his death, Cremin had been working on a biography
of educational pioneer John Dewey.
   Survivors include his wife, Charlotte, daughter Joanne of New
York City and son David of Los Angeles.
   The funeral will be private. Plans for a memorial service will
be announced later.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities fell in Tuesday's auction to their lowest level in
several weeks.
   The Treasury Department sold $9.2 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.39 percent, down from 7.49 percent
last week. Another $9.2 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 7.36 percent, down from 7.48 percent last
week.
   The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 7.23
percent on Aug. 6, and six-month bills averaged 7.31 percent on
Aug. 13.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 7.64 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,813.20 and 7.75 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,627.90.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 7.85
percent last week, down from 7.93 percent the previous week.

<TEXT>
   The White House said Tuesday it's still aiming
for a $50 billion reduction in next year's deficit, but is willing
to listen to proposals for a smaller target.
   Budget negotiators will resume their deliberations in private
Friday at Andrews Air Force Base in suburban Washington, staying
closeted there until Sunday in the hope of forging an agreement,
said White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``We still believe that we need to get a $50 billion reduction
in the first year and $500 billion over five years,'' Fitzwater
said. ``We still believe that deficit reduction is important, that
it's crucial to maintaining economic growth.''
   Some lawmakers have suggested the steep costs of the big U.S.
military build-up in the Persian Gulf, as well as the impact of
rising oil prices on an already sluggish economy, may force them to
scale back the goal of trimming $50 billion from next year's
deficit.
   ``We're willing to talk about it and that's what we're going to
the table to do,'' Fitzwater said when asked about the possibility
of a lower target.
   The White House, he said, will have a budget proposal to put on
the table at Andrews and it expects the Democrats to do the same.
   Both sides need to face ``the hard decisions,'' Fitzwater said.
   The Democrat-led Congress opened talks with the White House in
May on reducing the deficit, but the negotiations came to a
temporary halt in early August with little progress evident.
   Bush agreed June 26 that ``tax revenue increases'' were
necessary. But even after he broke his no-new-taxes vow and the
Republicans tentatively pushed forward a package of tax increases,
the Democrats refused to propose a matching package of cuts in
entitlement programs and other spending.
   Bush met with his Cabinet on Tuesday, and budget director
Richard Darman outlined the sequester scenario looming over the
government unless a budget agreement is reached before Oct. 1, the
start of the 1991 fiscal year. Federal agencies are girding for
possible layoffs.
   Fitzwater reiterated that Bush will not sign legislation
forestalling a sequester or softening the Gramm-Rudman deficit
reduction targets unless he and the Congress reach an overall
spending accord.
   The White House and congressional delegations _ led by Darman
and House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo. _ will resume
their talks Friday, spending the entire weekend at the base.
   Bush will leave Friday night from Andrews for his summit Sunday
in Helsinki, Finland, with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Fitzwater said if the weekend budget negotiations succeed, Bush
will meet with the top leaders of Congress to ``hammer out a final
agreement.''
   Under the Gramm-Rudman law, there will be automatic
across-the-board cuts in many federal programs beginning Oct. 1
unless the projected deficit is $64 billion or lower.
   The latest estimate from Darman's office is that the 1991
deficit will be $169 billion, or $231 billion if the costs of the
savings and loan bailout are added in. Higher oil prices and
escalating Pentagon costs are likely to produce even more red ink.

<HEAD>Poll Backs Greater Business Role in Improving Education</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Businesses should play a greater role in
improving schools by investing more dollars and personnel to boost
quality and prepare students for the workforce, a nationwide poll
said Tuesday.
   The Roper Organization poll, commissioned by an affiliate of the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, found 96 percent of Americans with
children in public school, as well as 91 percent of all Americans,
are concerned about the quality of education in their communities.
   Three-quarters of those polled agreed that public schools are
failing to prepare students for jobs now available. Sixty-three
percent said most students will lack skills for jobs in the future.
   Most of the 1,003 adult Americans polled over the telephone last
month were receptive to the involvement of business in local public
education. Ninety-one percent said it is a good idea for business
to provide equipment to schools, while 6 percent thought it was a
bad idea and 2 percent didn't know.
   Eighty-five percent want business to pay the cost of putting in
a course to teach certain technical skills, while 12 percent were
against the idea and 3 percent didn't know. Eighty percent said
business should give employees time off to teach a course in the
school system, compared with 15 percent against and 4 percent
undecided.
   Seventy-two percent called on business to take the lead in
improving community schools and 65 percent wanted business leaders
to run for school boards.
   ``It is interesting to note that the American public considers
the business community the education safety net for the nation,''
said Edward Donley, chairman of the chamber's Center for Workforce
Preparation and Quality Education.
   ``Business clearly has been given the mandate to lead the way to
better public schools and to help education in general,'' said
Donley,
   Keith Geiger, president of the National Education Association,
agreed that businesses should become more involved in public
schools but warned against an inclination to avoid key issues that
affect the quality of education.
   ``Where was business when President Bush vetoed the family and
medical leave act, ... where was business during discussions about
national health care ... or expanding preschool. These health-care
issues are (important) to kids learning,'' said Geiger.
``Businesses can't just pick and choose where they will get
active,'' he said.
   The Roper poll was designed to reflect public opinion with a
margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform program is
``on the brink of collapse,'' a leader of the Communist Party's
traditionalist wing told 2,500 delegates at a Russian party
congress in the Kremlin on Tuesday.
   Ivan K. Polozkov, first secretary of the Communist Party in the
Russian Republic, drew vigorous applause from the delegates, a
group that includes many generals and career party officials who
are believed to harbor reservations about Gorbachev's policies.
   Gorbachev sat on the podium at the front of the hall, remaining
virtually silent through a day of speeches that often contained
scathing criticism of his leadership, though without mentioning him
by name.
   Some of the day's strongest applause went to Ivan Vtorushin, a
worker from the Siberian city of Tyumen, who called for ``returning
the nation to 1985,'' the year in which Gorbachev assumed power.
   ``No matter what slogans are used, a policy resulting in falling
living standards and bloodshed is against popular interests,''
Vtorushin said, referring to the Soviet Union's accelerating
economic problems and ethnic strife.
   The delegates are meeting this week to complete the process of
creating a separate Russian branch of the Communist Party.
   Until this year the Russian Republic, the largest of the Soviet
Union's 15 constituent republics, did not have its own party
organization. Communists living in Russia were simply members of
the Soviet Party, headed by Gorbachev.
   The first meeting of the new Russian Communist Party, held in
Moscow in June, was dominated by traditionalists and was widely
viewed in the Soviet Union as an effort by them to gain influence
and public support.
   Since June, three reformist delegates have resigned their seats
in the congress because of its domination by traditionalists.
Another reformer, economist Otto Latsis, announced at Tuesday's
session that he was resigning in protest from a committee drafting
the party's platform.
   Reformists also made some other moves on Tuesday, such as
calling unsuccessfully for the resignation of the 55-year-old
Polozkov. But for the most part, the session was again dominated by
traditionalists.
   In his hour-long keynote address, Polozkov urged delegates to
counter the ``deliberate discrediting of the Communist Party and
the socialist choice as a whole.''
   He said the country's economic crisis, caused by the Soviet
people's psychological unpreparedness for a market-based system,
``is, in the final analysis, putting perestroika on the brink of
collapse.''
   His comments echoed complaints expressed Monday by Muscovites
who stood in line across the city to buy bread, which had been one
of the few foods Soviet consumers could obtain easily.
   It is now in short supply across Moscow for the first time since
the early 1960s, despite a record grain harvest. Izvestia and
Moskovskaya Pravda blamed the shortage on Moscow's bakeries, which
they said could not keep up with demand.
   ``That's perestroika _ we're not moving forward forward, we're
going backward,'' said Viktor Lyubeznov, one frustrated shopper
Monday.
   Among other speakers at the Russian party congress was the head
of the KGB in the Moscow region, Vitaly Prilukov, who lamented the
``atrophying of power'' in the Soviet Union and said the national
party had ``willingly allowed anti-socialist structures to seize
the initiative.''
   Despite the complaints, Polozkov said later at a news conference
that he is ``convinced there is no going back'' to the way things
were before Gorbachev.
   ``The delegates ... are just wondering what's happening, with
five years of perestroika and no improvements,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia has relaxed his
long-held anti-abortion position and now says he believes the
abortion decision should be left ``to the informed conscience of
the mother'' in most cases.
   Nunn, frequently mentioned as a potential Democratic
presidential candidate in 1992, said he favors prohibiting abortion
only when the fetus is viable, or capable of living outside the
womb.
   In a letter to be sent to constituents who write him about the
abortion issue, Nunn wrote: ``I favor leaving the decision prior to
viability to the informed conscience of the mother, and prohibiting
abortions after viability except in cases where the life of the
mother is threatened.''
   In the past, Nunn was a supporter of proposed constitutional
amendments to overturn the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade
decision that legalized abortion.
   Nunn was not available for comment Tuesday. His press secretary,
Scott Williams, said the senator's shift on abortion did not signal
any change in Nunn's announced position that he has ``no plans at
this time to seek the presidency.''
   In the letter, Nunn said he still considers abortion ``a tragedy
and an act of great moral consequence that should be strongly
discouraged except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of
the mother is endangered.''
   But he said laws prohibiting early abortions cannot be enforced
because legalized abortion has been the law of the land since the
1973 Supreme Court decision.
   ``I do not believe that large segments of the American people
and the medical profession will accept or obey a law making
early-term abortions a criminal act after all those years,'' Nunn
wrote.
   ``The law can only accomplish so much, and with respect to
abortion, I believe the only enforceable line the law can draw is
to protect the unborn child when it is clear an independent life is
involved,'' Nunn said.
   But, he added, ``I hope we have not reached the point in this
country when anything that is not prohibited by law is considered
morally and ethically acceptable.''

<HEAD>Number of Consumers With Delinquent Loans Rises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of consumers 30 days or more behind
on their bank loan payments increased in the April-June period
after falling the previous two quarters, a trade group said Tuesday.
   The American Bankers Association said a survey of 800 banks
showed a delinquency rate on consumer loans of 2.55 percent, up
from the 2.46 percent in the first quarter and far above the 2.30
percent rate of a year ago.
   The group's chief economist, Robert H. Dugger, said that credit
delinquencies are ``indicative of what's happening in the rest of
the economy.''
   ``The current delinquency rate, even though up somewhat, is
still considered moderate. Consumers have been slowing their
spending for several quarters, and are expected to remain
cautious,'' he said.
   The delinquency rate includes seven types of closed-end consumer
loans: personal; two types of auto loans; mobile home; recreational
vehicle; property improvement, and home equity.
   The District of Columbia reported the lowest delinquency rate
with 1.22 percent, followed by Arizona with 1.24 percent and then
Nebraska with 1.38 percent.
   The states with the worst rates were New Hampshire with 5.99
percent; Massachusetts with 5.03 percent; Puerto Rico with 4.85
percent; and Connecticut with 4.81 percent.
   The delinquency rate for open-ended home equity credit lines,
which are tracked separately, was virtually unchanged at 0.75
percent, compared with 0.79 percent in the first quarter.

   U.S. Navy and Coast Guard sailors boarded
an Iraqi-flagged freighter in the Gulf of Oman early Tuesday as it
was sailing to an Iraqi port with a cargo of tea.
   The sailors planned to stay on the ship, the Zanoobia, and
escort it to another port, the officials said. Thirteen hours after
the boarding, U.S. military sources said officials had not yet
designated where the freighter would go.
   After Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, the U.N. Security
Council endorsed an economic embargo against Iraq and subsequently
approved the use of force to back it up.
   The 3,549-ton freighter was first challenged by radio by the USS
Goldsborough when it reported it was bound for the Iraqi port of
Basra with a cargo of tea.
   Navy officials, reading from a Pentagon announcement, said the
boarding took place after the vessel refused orders from the
Goldsborough to either return to its port of origin or proceed to a
non-prohibited port.
   Shipping sources in the region had said the vessel, en route
from Sri Lanka, was stopped before it could reach the Strait of
Hormuz, the gateway to the Persian Gulf.
   ``The team met no resistance and they will remain aboard the
ship until it reaches its due destination,'' the Pentagon statement
said.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the U.S. Navy
stopped and boarded the tea-laden Iraqi-flagged freighter in the
Gulf of Oman as part of the trade embargo against Iraq.
   ``The ship was ordered to divert. It did not divert. It was then
boarded and now has diverted,'' the spokesman said. ``We don't have
information now on where it's being diverted to.''
   Tuesday's incident was the first publicly acknowledged boarding
by U.S. forces of an Iraqi-flagged vessel since the U.N. embargo
was clamped on Iraq last month. But U.S. military sources, speaking
on condition of anonymity, indicated that might not be the case.
   They said Pentagon listings show more than 450 vessels have been
challenged by radio by U.S. warships and that ``less than 20 had
been boarded, and less than five diverted.''
   When pressed as to whether other Iraq-flagged vessels were
involved, they said the records were not broken down by nationality.
   The only other ship publicly reported to have been boarded by
U.S. forces _ and subsequently prevented from docking _ was the
91,478-ton Kota Wirama, managed by the Pacific International Lines
of Singapore.
   That vessel was intercepted in the Red Sea on Aug. 28, boarded
and searched, and then prevented from proceeding to the Jordanian
port of Aqaba.
   Shipping executives said the vessel was suspected of carrying
chemicals destined for Iraq.
   Warning shots were fired across the bows of two Iraqi-flagged
tankers on Aug. 18 when Defense Secretary Dick Cheney was visiting
the area. The two tankers were empty.

   He didn't make it to historic
Kitty Hawk, but pilot Eric Raymond on Tuesday celebrated the first
transcontinental flight in a solar-powered plane: by going sailing.
   ``I hope this will help enlighten people to the potential of
solar power and alternative energy sources,'' Raymond said of his
2,467-mile flight.
   Raymond, 33, said winds prevented a Kitty Hawk landing but were
good for sailboarding.
   Raymond's Sun Seeker ultralight aircraft was safe from the wind
in a shed at the farm he landed Monday, nine miles short of the
Wright Brothers Memorial.
   ``If I had an hour more time Monday I could have made it in,''
Raymond said as he relaxed on a beach not far from Kitty Hawk,
where the Wright brothers pioneered powered flight.
   Low visibility, rain and unfavorable wind forced him to land at
the farm near the community of Spot, about 500 yards from Currituck
Sound, which separates the mainland from the offshore barrier
island where Kitty Hawk and Kill Devil Hills are located.
   The Sun Seeker depends on sunshine and favorable wind. Solar
cells produce power for its electric motor, which is used for
takeoffs and landings. After takeoff, the plane rides thermals,
columns of rising warm air, like a glider.
   Raymond said Tuesday's 35 mph northeasterly gusts would create
turbulence around the trees surrounding the airstrip at the Wright
Memorial.
   ``I wouldn't want to land there with more than 10 or 12 mph
winds,'' he said.
   Raymond said the trip ``took a bit longer than I expected but
that's because it was against the wind. I expected to have
prevailing westerlies but instead it was more easterly.''
   Two weeks was Raymond's goal for completing the trip but wind
and weather delays stretched the trip to 32 days, including 23 days
in the air. He took off from Desert Center, Calif., about 200 miles
east of Los Angeles.
   Raymond said the rigors of flying and the attraction of the
beach and good sailboarding weather were enough to call him off
work for a day.
   He said he liked sailboarding because ``you have a clean,
endless source of energy. You can wind surf at 30 mph all day long.
I like anything that's natural like that that doesn't pollute.''
   He said he would set his plane up for people to see Wednesday
before driving home to California.
   His father, Sam Raymond, said he's glad the trip is over,
although his son wanted to achieve his goal of flying to the
monument.
   ``There's a little bit of disappointment that he didn't get to
the exact landing point that he wanted,'' the elder Raymond said.
   Raymond first took off July 16 from Desert Center to prove an
aircraft partly powered by solar energy could cross the United
States. Two days later, the 198-pound craft was damaged in an
aborted takeoff from Lordsburg, N.M.
   The Sun Seeker, Raymond and his ground crew returned by land to
Lake Elsinore, Calif., for repairs. Raymond manufactured and sold
hang gliding equipment there until six months ago, when he devoted
himself to the Sun Seeker project.
   The former national hang-gliding champion took off again from
Desert Center on Aug. 2.

<TEXT>
   More than 40,000 ragged Asian refugees
from Kuwait and Iraq fought for bread and water Tuesday in a
sweltering desert camp as Jordanian troops struggled to impose
order.
   ``We're fighting because we're hungry and thirsty. If they don't
move us out of here soon we will all die,'' complained Ahmed Saed,
a white-bearded Pakistani.
   Hani Tamini, a sturdy young man of about 30 from Bangladesh
said: ``I've had no food today, none yesterday and very little the
day before that. It's better to die rather than fight like this for
a scrap of bread.''
   Another man wailed: ``I've been trying for three days to get
some food for my children and wife and I haven't been able to get
any.''
   The camp is in the baking hot desert at Shaalan between the
Iraqi frontier and the Jordanian border post of Ruweishid, 50 miles
inside Jordan.
   It is used as a staging post for the tens of thousands of
Asians, most of them penniless, fleeing Kuwait.
   They have been allowed to cross into Jordan but are not allowed
through the border post because Jordan wants guarantees the
refugees' governments will repatriate them.
   Jordan, burdened by an $8 billion national debt, has been
swamped by more than 420,000 refugees since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion
of Kuwait. The nation's social services are strained to their
breaking point.
   Crown Prince Hassan, who visited the camps two days ago, accused
the international community Tuesday of not doing enough to help
Jordan or the refugees.
   He told a news conference in Amman that ``the situation may soon
become critical'' for the people he called ``the downtrodden of the
earth.''
   More than 100,000 impoverished Asians are stranded at Ruweishid
and the makeshift desert camps. Food is scarce. Some people have
died.
   At Shaalan Tuesday, thousands of men and women pushed and
scuffled beside a large trailer truck from which Jordanian
officials and soldiers were trying to distribute food rations _ a
round piece of flat Arab bread, one tomato and one cucumber per
person.
   The crush was so great the frazzled soldiers began flaying the
refugees with belts and sticks, yelling at them to stop fighting
and get in line.
   But again and again, as soon as some semblance of a line was
formed, there was a fresh rush on the food truck as the thousands
of people at the back of the line, screaming and stretching out
their hands, stampeded to get closer before the food ran out.
   It went on for hours.
   When the pandemonium subsided, refugees scavenged in the sand
for crushed remnants of bread, tomatoes and cucumbers.
   ``It's not easy to control people who are hungry and thirsty,''
said Suleyman Bakr, one of five Jordanian doctors manning a medical
tent.
   ``We need more food, more water, and better organization. But
what's needed more than anything is to get these people to their
countries as soon as possible,'' he said. Most of the refugees are
from Bangladesh, Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, the Philippines and
Thailand.
   About a quarter of the people at Ruweishid are jammed into small
army tents. Most lie on the sand with little protection from the
sun.
   Some refugees have been in the camp for nearly two weeks. There
is little sanitation.
   ``It would have been better to stay in Iraq and face death
there, rather than die in this terrible stink hole in the desert,''
said one Bangladeshi.

<HEAD>ABA Panel Gives Souter Highest Rating for Professional
Qualifications</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Bar Association's judicial
screening panel Tuesday gave Supreme Court nominee David H. Souter
its highest rating for professional qualifications to sit on the
nation's highest court.
   The well-qualified rating is ``reserved for those who meet the
highest standards of integrity, professional competence and
judicial temperament,'' according to the guidebook followed by the
15-member Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary.
   The committee vote was unanimous, the panel said in a letter to
the Justice Department.
   The rating is expected to give a boost to Souter's nomination,
scheduled to be taken up Sept. 13 by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   Still, Souter is expected to be questioned closely about his
judicial philosophy, and senators are expected to try to probe his
views on the landmark 1973 ruling that legalized abortion.
   Souter received a similar well-qualified rating before being
confirmed earlier this year to sit on the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Boston, but the ABA panel applies different standards
for Supreme Court nominees.
   As part of the most-recent ABA study, two teams of law
professors at Stanford and Northwestern universities reviewed
Souter's legal writings as a New Hampshire Supreme Court judge and
New Hampshire state attorney general.
   Another review was conducted for the ABA by a group of lawyers
headed by former solicitor general Rex Lee, now president of
Brigham Young University.
   The legal writings of Souter, a Rhodes Scholar who graduated
from Harvard Law School, provide few clues to his thinking on such
pressing issues as abortion. But conservative groups have expressed
satisfaction with President Bush's choice.
   The chairman of the ABA panel, Ralph I. Lancaster Jr., told
Deputy Attorney General William P. Barr of the rating in a brief
letter released by the Justice Department.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, attending a law enforcement
conference in Seoul, South Korea, issued a statement saying the
rating confirms that Bush ``has selected a man of superb intellect
and qualifications.''
   The White House also welcomed the ABA's seal of approval.
   ``The president is pleased to receive this news and looks
forward to a speedy confirmation,'' said White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   Arthur J. Kropp, president of the liberal People for the
American Way, said the rating ``comes as no surprise.''
   ``Souter's technical qualifications were never in question,''
Kropp said in a statement. ``What the Souter nomination will turn
on is his judicial philosophy, which the ABA's rating does not
account for.''
   People for the American Way, which helped defeat Robert Bork's
nomination for the Supreme Court three years ago, plans to issue a
report on Souter's record at the outset of the Senate hearings.
   The ABA ratings have been a source of controversy in the past.
The panel split in 1987 over Bork, with 10 members voting to rate
him ``well qualified'' while four others found him ``not
qualified.'' Another member voted ``not opposed'' to Bork.
   The Senate defeated Bork's nomination after a bitter fight led
by a coalition of civil rights and abortion rights activists.

   When an army truck broke
down recently in the middle of this West Bank town, Palestinian
teen-agers sprang into action.
   ``They trashed it,'' said an Israeli army officer who witnessed
the scene. ``They broke every window, smashed every door and
fender.''
   The incident was a reminder that the Palestinian revolt against
Israeli occupation, though eclipsed by the gulf crisis, persists as
an angry war of stones and empty bottles against well-armed Israeli
troops.
   The uprising, known in Arabic as the ``intefadeh,'' marks its
1,000th day Wednesday. The PLO-backed underground leadership of the
revolt called for the anniversary to be marked with protest marches
under the banner ``Intefadeh until a Palestinian state.''
   That goal remains illusive for the 1.7 million Palestinians in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and the character of the
struggle is changing amid a more restrained Israeli military policy
and the impact of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   Palestinian support for Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein has
disappointed the United States and other Western nations that tried
to mediate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
   ``There's no doubt that Israel is reaping political gains from
the gulf crisis,'' said Ghassan Khatib, a Palestinian professor
from this town just north of Jerusalem.
   ``There are fewer pressures on Israel from the United States to
start a dialogue with the Palestinians,'' Khatib said. ``There is
no more talk about Israeli violations of human rights in the
occupied territories.''
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Tuesday dismissed
reporters' questions about the anniversary.
   ``It doesn't have any impact on the progress of the Jewish
people and the Jewish state,'' Shamir said.
   Since the revolt began in December 1987, a total of 728
Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians. In
addition, 255 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs, most
on suspicion of collaboration with Israel. Forty-seven Israelis
have died.
   In recent months, according to both Palestinians and Israeli
army officials, there has been a marked slowdown in the uprising.
   Under Defense Minister Moshe Arens, the army since June has
reduced its forces in heavily populated areas and tightened firing
rules, sharply reducing Palestinian casualties.
   In the past three months, 11 Palestinians have died from Israeli
army gunfire. In the same period last year, the toll was 77.
   ``It reflects more experience by the army in handling the
situation,'' said an army spokesman, who cannot be identified by
name under military rules. ``Troops are positioned so there is less
friction with the local population.''
   Meanwhile, the Palestinian side shows signs of fatigue from the
almost weekly general strikes ordered by uprising leaders and
forced closures by the army.
   ``Our business barely feeds our family,'' said Zaki Musleh, a
60-year-old carpenter with a shop on Ramallah's Palestine Street.
``No one has any money.''
   Musleh's shop, like many others, is short one worker. His
28-year-old son Bassam is in army custody, one of more than 910
Palestinians held without charge or trial under military
``administrative detention'' rules.
   Some 9,015 other Palestinians also are in jail, charged or
awaiting trial or sentenced for anti-Israeli crimes, the army says.
   Palestinians remain resilient despite the revolt's failure to
achieve its main political goal of getting the Israelis out of the
territories they seized in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Palestinian journalist Daoud Kuttab said he believes the main
achievement of the intefadeh has been a change in Palestinian
attitudes.
   ``Palestinians are no longer thinking as an occupied people.
They are thinking as a people resisting occupation,'' he said.
``That is why the uprising will continue.''
   In Ramallah's Kadura refugee camp, 29-year-old truck driver Ziad
Zmekna points to greater international awareness of the
Palestinians' plight as another gain from the uprising.
   Zmekna's life is a measure of Palestinian determination. One of
his brothers is jailed, another is hiding from authorities, and
Zmekna himself has lost his driver's license for failure to pay
income taxes to the Israelis.
   He points to a photo on his wall, the wedding portrait of a
Palestinian friend killed by Israeli troops last year.
   ``The intefadeh will continue for our martyrs, it will continue
for us,'' Zmekna said. ``This is our national duty.''

   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady expressed
optimism as he began a global search Tuesday for billions of
dollars in international assistance to support the campaign against
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   ``The diplomatic and military branches are well in place. What
needs to be put in place now is the economic branch,'' Brady told
reporters aboard his plane, adding that he was looking forward to a
``most successful trip.''
   Brady was leading one of two high-level delegations dispatched
by President Bush to ask America's allies to help defray the cost
of the U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf and to provide
assistance to allies hurt by the trade embargo against Iraq.
   While previous reports have put the possible first-year price
tag for the assistance package at $25 billion, officials traveling
with Brady indicated the final amount could go higher.
   Brady met first with French Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy
and then with French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas.
   Speaking to reporters at the French Foreign Ministry, Brady
called the discussions ``very successful.''
   But neither Brady nor Dumas would say whether any agreements
were reached on America's request for added financial assistance.
   But Brady did say, ``We were very pleased with (Dumas')
reaction.''
   ``There is diplomatic support, there is military support and now
we have the job of providing economic support,'' Brady said before
departing.
   Following the Paris meetings, Brady was to fly to London for
talks Wednesday with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   In a trip that will span 30 time zones over four days, the Brady
delegation was also scheduled to meet with South Korean President
Roh Tae-woo and Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.
   On Wednesday, Secretary of State James A. Baker III will leave
Washington on a similar pledge-seeking mission first to the
oil-rich countries of the Middle East and later to West Germany and
Italy.
   The Bush administration has a lot riding on its fund drive. It
fears that without a substantial flow of economic assistance in the
form of cash, loans and loan guarantees, Third World nations
especially hurt by the loss of trade with Iraq will violate the
embargo.
   The administration is counting on the trade embargo to force
Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait without using American troops to force
a rollback.
   Officials speaking to reporters on Brady's flight from
Washington to Paris said that a critical need was to get
commitments for $10 billion or more to provide assistance to
Turkey, Jordan and Egypt, the three countries in the Middle East
suffering the most economically from a loss of trade opportunities
with Iraq and other turmoil in the region.
   One official, who spoke on the condition his name not be used,
said the United States was seeking whatever resources were needed
to help the three countries.
   ``You have got to finance that one way or the other,'' he said.
   In addition, the official said, the Brady mission would be
discussing support for the U.S. military buildup, which was costing
an estimated $46 million a day.
   Congressional critics have pressed Bush to get commitments to
defray the impact on the U.S. budget deficit of defending the
Persian Gulf oil resources, especially from such economic
powerhouses as Japan and West Germany.
   Bush and other members of the National Security Council reviewed
a proposal last week that carried a $23 billion price tag over the
first year with $10 billion of that earmarked to ease the economic
pain for countries supporting the trade embargo and the other $13
billion going to the U.S. military to pay for such costs as
transportation, housing and fuel.
   Other reports have put the figure at $25 billion, but the
official traveling with Brady said any number cited now would very
likely be revised upward, given the changing nature of the
situation.
   The official said that other Third World countries, including
the emerging democracies in Eastern Europe, as well as nations such
as Brazil and the Philippines, would likely receive economic
assistance from the international package being assembled. The
money would be used to compensate them for the rising world price
of oil, the official said.

   Soldiers fired on thousands of
angry blacks Tuesday and rival gangs fought with axes, knives and
spears as at least 40 people were killed in township violence.
   The violence came as President F.W. de Klerk and African
National Congress leader Nelson Mandela visited black townships
near Johannesburg to call for a halt in fighting that has killed
more than 550 people since Aug. 12.
   The government has imposed emergency restrictions and sent elite
army units to the townships, but fighting between Zulu followers of
the conservative Inkatha movement and other blacks loyal to the ANC
raged for a fourth week.
   In Sebokeng, a pre-dawn clash killed four people at a migrant
workers' hostel, police said. The victims were believed to be
township residents abducted by hostel dwellers.
   About 5,000 township residents angered by the killings gathered
at the hostel, police said.
   When the mob refused to disperse, army troops were called in and
a ``shooting incident occurred,'' said police Col. Frans Malherbe.
``The bodies of 11 persons were found after the mob dispersed.''
   South African newspaper photographer N. Khumalo told the South
African Press Association that ``people came toward (the soldiers)
waving their hands, saying `peace, we are not fighting.' Some of
them even sat down.''
   The troops ``took up position, cocked their guns _ I thought
maybe they wanted to scare the people,'' Khumalo was quoted as
saying. ``All of a sudden there was shooting. Many of the people
ran. Some of the people fell.''
   The shooting marked the first time soldiers have been involved
in a clash that has resulted in a loss of lives since they were
deployed last month in the townships.
   In March, police opened fire on black demonstrators in Sebokeng,
killing at least five and wounding more than 150. A judicial
inquiry criticized police for the killings, saying gunfire was
unjustified.
   Malherbe said both police and military were investigating
Tuesday's shootings.
   A later police report Tuesday put the Sebokeng death toll at 36,
with the other killings occurring in sporadic clashes near the
hostel and adjacent areas. Police said more than 150 people were
arrested.
   Black crowds also stoned journalists in Sebokeng and burned one
reporter's car.
   A soundman for WTN, a British television agency, was arrested in
Vosloorus after being told to leave the area, WTN bureau chief
Vincent Francis said.
   WTN deputy bureau chief Vincent Francis said the soundman, Brian
Green, told the bureau over a mobile telephone he was leaving when
police assaulted and detained him. A police spokesman said any
alleged assault would be investigated.
   Police also reported three deaths in Vosloorus and one in
Katlehong in overnight street clashes. Both townships are southeast
of Johannesburg.
   Rival factions continued to skirmish Tuesday in Vosloorus with
axes, spears and other crude weapons. Police fired tear gas and
shotguns to keep the groups apart.
   Mandela visited Sebokeng on Tuesday afternoon and said he was
``outraged'' after viewing bodies at a mortuary.
   The ANC deputy president repeated his accusation that police
fueled the violence by siding with Inkatha fighters. But he also
said police arrested more than 100 Inkatha supporters, including
youth leader Themba Khoza.
   He later spoke in Xhosa to a crowd of township residents and
appealed for calm, then met with Law and Order Minister Adriaan
Vlok. Neither man issued a statement afterward.
   On Monday, Mandela called for an independent investigation of
police actions in the townships similar to the one that followed
the Sebokeng shootings in March.
   De Klerk has ordered Vlok to investigate the charges of police
bias. He and other officials have said some individuals may have
acted improperly.
   Vlok said Tuesday that government opponents were waging an
orchestrated campaign to discredit the police.
   De Klerk made his first visit as president to the Soweto
township southwest of Johannesburg, where more than 100 people have
died in factional fighting.
   Youths mobbed the president and shouted ``Viva, de Klerk!'' At
one stop, he visited a migrant worker hostel where recent battles
have occurred.
   De Klerk later told a news conference conditions in the hostels
were ``unacceptable'' and that the government would spend millions
of dollars for housing and education in the townships.
   The ANC-Inkatha feud has claimed about 5,000 lives since 1986 in
the eastern province of Natal, where most of the blacks are Zulus.
The fighting spread to Johannesburg area townships this month.
   Mandela and Zulu leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi have been
criticized for failing to stop the carnage.
   Buthelezi has called for a meeting with Mandela, but the ANC has
refused. Mandela said Monday the problem could not be solved by
individuals.

   The New York City subway system has a new
advertising slogan: ``We're coming back, so you come back!''
   Brian Watkins, an annual visitor from Provo, Utah, came back
once too often. He was waiting in a midtown Manhattan station
Sunday night when a group of youths robbed his father and punched
his mother. Watkins fought back, and one of the youths stabbed him
to death.
   Eight teen-agers were arrested Monday and charged with murder
and robbery, police said.
   Watkins' slaying was one more disaster for the nation's largest
subway system, which began the century as an engineering marvel and
seems destined to end it as a social disaster.
   The blood stain in the Seventh Avenue station had faded Tuesday,
but not the disgust over what had happened there.
   Like Watkins, Dockery Clark of Greensboro, N.C., also came to
New York for the U.S. Open tennis tournament. She said she had been
mugged in the station next to the one where Watkins died.
   ``Two guys jumped me, beat my back and stole my watch and
bracelet,'' she told the Daily News. ``My boyfriend saw (Mayor)
David Dinkins (at the tournament), walked up to him, and told him
his city is a cesspool.''
   Carolina Brani, another Open spectator, lives in Milan. But she
was clear about one thing: ``I know the subway is never safe. Day
or night, there is no difference.''
   Crime is rising throughout New York City, and rising even faster
in the subways. Last year, subway felonies increased 18 percent,
while reported major crimes rose 4 percent in the city as a whole.
   Watkins' slaying was the 18th this year in the subway system,
versus 20 in all of 1989, and robberies are up 29 percent.
   The fact that less than 3 percent of all city crime occurs in
the subways is of scant comfort to most riders.
   ``People are not moved by statistics,'' said Thomas Reppetto,
director of the Citizens Crime Commission, a privately financed
citizens group. ``Too many things have happened down there to too
many people.''
   Brian Watkins was no victim-in-waiting. He had ridden the
subways many times before; he was in the company of four other
people, including two men. It was not that late _ midtown at 10:20
p.m. is as busy as some cities at noon _ and the station at Seventh
Avenue and 53rd Street is not one of the more dangerous.
   To many, the brazen attack on the Watkins family merely confirms
a visceral sense of subterranean danger.
   Most stations are dirty, smelly, noisy and dimly lit. The
Transit Authority has closed station newsstands, reduced token
booth hours and cut off-hours service on some lines.
   The agency's police department has been nagged by scandals, and
in August it ran out of money in a special city fund for paying
overtime for police officers on subway robbery patrol.
   ``For a lot of people, to go down into a cavern is a little
frightening, no matter what,'' said Reppetto. ``But when they see
homeless people living there and disorderly people, they feel that
things are not under control.''
   After steadily increasing for several years, ridership has
declined. Only about a quarter of city residents ride the subway
each day, and to many such a trip has become virtually unthinkable.
A few years ago then-Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward admitted his
wife had never taken the subway.
   During the past five years graffiti has been vastly reduced.
Trains are more punctual, and the Transit Authority has several
billion dollars to spend on further improvements. ``The level of
service used to be intolerable,'' said Gene Russianoff, a mass
transit advocate. ``Now it's tolerably bad.''
   But many riders, past and present, feel that what really makes
the subways dangerous are some of the people in them, people as
callous as the ones who allegedly attacked the Watkins family and
then headed off to the Roseland ballroom for some dancing.
   ``There are a lot of proposals out there for improving safety in
the subways,'' said Russianoff. ``I'm afraid none of them would
have helped Mr. Watkins.''

<HEAD>Mexico to Sell Unleaded Gasoline Along Major Tourist Routes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pemex, Mexico's oil monopoly, will this month
begin selling a new unleaded gasoline at more than one-third of the
country's 3,200 gas stations, the official news agency Notimex
reported Tuesday.
   The new gasoline, to be sold along major tourist routes, has
one-fifth the amount of lead contained in the widely used Extra
grade of gasoline, the report said.
   The 12 routes include the Tijuana-Cabo San Lucas area; Nuevo
Laredo-Mexico City; Mexico City-Acapulco; Mexico City-Oaxaca; and
Mexico City-Ixtapa.
   The agency said use of the new unleaded gasoline will be
mandatory in cars made in Mexico starting next year but is not
suitable for use in pre-1985 models.
   Pemex said it has spent $345 million to produce and distribute
the new fuel. In most areas the cost will be the same as the Extra
grade, with prices higher along the U.S.-Mexico border.

   A delegation of U.S. senators led by Sen. Robert
Dole met with Boris N. Yeltsin on Tuesday and discussed arms
control, taxation and the shortage-plagued Soviet economy.
   Dole, R-Kan., and his fellow Republican senators planned to meet
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the Kremlin on Wednesday
before returning to the United States.
   Yeltsin, the president of the Russian republic, is locked in a
struggle with Gorbachev over the pace of reform in the Soviet
Union. He expressed interest in talking with the senators about
several issues, including arms control and taxation.
   ``We here in Russia are just beginning to tackle these issues,''
Yeltsin said as the meeting began. ``It would be interesting for us
to know your points of view and what you would advise.''
   Yeltsin made reference to his republic's effort to wrest more
control over its affairs from the central Soviet government led by
Gorbachev.
   ``We are beginning to have some doubt about whether the
legislation for things like taxation by the central government is
the right one,'' he told the senators. ``So we're going to pass our
own laws.''
   Dole was joined on the trip by fellow Republicans John Warner of
Virginia, Alfonse D'Amato of New York, Connie Mack of Florida, Don
Nickles of Oklahoma, Steven Symms of Idaho and Jake Garn of Utah.
   Dole mentioned some of the topics on his agenda during a brief
airport news conference.
   ``We're very interested to see how the economic reforms are
coming along and also to get the views of Mr. Gorbachev, in
particular, on the crisis in the gulf,'' he said.
   Dole also spoke about this weekend's upcoming summit in Finland
between Gorbachev and President Bush. He said the superpowers
should coordinate their efforts in the Persian Gulf to avoid
misunderstandings.
   ``My view is there's probably some Soviet apprehension about the
buildup of U.S. forces'' in the gulf, Dole said. ``Thus far the
Soviets have been very cooperative and supportive.
   ``Whether or not President Bush will make a direct appeal to Mr.
Gorbachev about additional military force on behalf of the
Russians, I don't know,'' he added. ``But it should be a very
candid discussion, because so far it's pretty top-heavy American in
the gulf crisis.''
   Warner added: ``We shall also discuss with Mr. Gorbachev the
status and the role of the Soviet military advisers that were in
the gulf with Iraqi forces just before the invasion, and as far as
we know, are still there.
   ``News reports are that they had no role in the invasion,'' he
added, ``but we want to hear that directly from President
Gorbachev.''
   The Soviet Union has 193 military advisers in Iraq and it has
said they are under contractual obligation to continue training
Iraqi soldiers to use, maintain and repair their Soviet-made
weapons.

<HEAD>Jury Selection Begins in Retrial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jury selection began Tuesday in the retrial of
three men accused of riot in the 1986 Howard Beach attack in which
a gang of whites chased a black man to his death.
   William Bollander, 21, and James Povinelli and Thomas Farino,
both 20, were convicted of riot two years ago. But those
convictions were overturned by an appeals court, which ruled the
trial judge made errors that hurt the defense.
   That trial was the second stemming from the Dec. 20, 1986, death
of Michael Griffith, 23.
   Griffith and two other blacks were attacked after they walked
into the predominantly white Howard Beach section of Queens when
their car broke down.
   A gang of whites chased Griffith onto the Belt Parkway, where he
was struck by a car and killed. Three teen-agers were convicted of
manslaughter in the first trial.
   There will be some similarities with the two earlier cases:
victim Cedric Sandiford is expected to be the key government
witness, and defense lawyers will argue their clients were not part
of the mob that attacked the blacks.
   The appeals court ruled that state Supreme Court Justice Thomas
Demakos erred when he refused to give the jury the option of
convicting the three on the lesser charge of disorderly conduct.
Demakos will preside over the retrial.

<HEAD>North Prosecutor Asks Appellate Panel to Reconsider Ruling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran-Contra prosecutor Lawrence E. Walsh
sought a rehearing Tuesday of the split federal appeals court
decision that set aside former White House aide Oliver L. North's
three felony convictions.
   The independent counsel petitioned the three-judge panel, which
voted 2-1 to vacate North's convictions, to reconsider its decision
and suggested that the full 12-member court hear the case.
   In a tartly worded petition, Walsh accused Circuit Judges
Laurence Silberman and David Sentelle of incorrect legal analysis
and ``a plain misreading of the record'' of North's trial to reach
their decision.
   On July 20, they ordered a ``witness by witness'' hearing to
determine if the evidence against North had been influenced by the
testimony he gave Congress about the Iran-Contra affair under a
limited grant of immunity from prosecution.
   That so-called ``use immunity'' grant barred Walsh from using
North's testimony as evidence in a criminal prosecution.
   But Walsh called the panel's order ``an unwarranted extension of
use immunity protection'' that was ``particularly unjustified''
because his office took special precautions to ensure that
prosecutors were not exposed to North's testimony.
   The restrictions on the use by prosecutors of immunized
testimony ``do not extend to the independent conduct of third-party
witnesses, particularly witnesses who testify on the basis of
personal knowledge,'' Walsh said.
   To meet the appellate judges' requirements, it would be
necessary ``to probe the psychological processes of each witness,
many of whom are irrelevant to the conviction,'' Walsh said.
   Quoting from the dissenting opinion of Chief Judge Patricia
Wald, Walsh said the hearing would make ```virtually impossible'
the criminal prosecution of a person who provides public immunized
testimony.''
   The former National Security Council aide was convicted of
aiding and abetting the obstruction of Congress, altering or
destroying NSC documents and accepting an illegal gratuity _ the
construction of a security fence around his home.
   North was fined $150,000 and ordered to perform 1,200 hours of
community service.
   If allowed to stand, the appellate court decision also
jeopardizes the five felony convictions of Poindexter, who was
sentenced to six months in prison for lying to Congress about
covert assistance to the Nicaraguan Contras and the sale of U.S.
arms to Iran.
   Walsh also attacked the panel's reversal of North's conviction
for destroying or altering government documents. The panel held
that the jury should have been told it could consider the fact that
North thought he was not acting illegally when he destroyed
documents.
   This reasoning, ``effectively places government records at the
mercy of officially directed coverups,'' Walsh said.
   Walsh could have bypassed the appellate court and gone directly
to the Supreme Court to seek reinstatement of North's conviction.
But he chose a more cautious approach of returning to the appellate
court and seeking reconsideration of its decision.
   He needs the votes of seven judges to win a rehearing of the
case by the full court. Walsh apparently calculated that he could
win the votes of three new members of the court appointed by
President Bush in addition to four liberal judges who were
appointed by President Carter.
   Silberman and Sentelle are among a group of five conservative
judges appointed by President Reagan.

   Oh, that Christie Brinkley. Cover
girl, married to Billy Joel, mother of a beautiful daughter _ and
now she's figured out a way to fight Lyme disease.
   Brinkley is raising guinea hens on her Long Island estate, and
she believes the fowl are eating the deer ticks on her land. The
ticks are carriers of potentially fatal Lyme disease, which has
struck Suffolk County harder than any other county in the state
this summer.
   When the actress-model told Rep. George Hochbrueckner about the
hens on patrol, the congressman quickly seized the (photo)
opportunity.
   Brinkley and Joel will soon be hosts to the congressman and a
team of researchers who want to determine if the deer tick
population is lower on the celebrity property than at the
neighbors' homes.
   The New York Democrat said the researchers also will take some
of the hens back to a laboratory to see if the animals can tell the
difference between dog ticks and deer ticks.
   Brinkley told Hochbrueckner she noticed the number of deer ticks
dropped after she let the hens wander around the property.
   Hochbrueckner said the guinea hens are used in Africa to keep
ticks out of barnyards.

Airport about 1:30 p.m. EDT when pilots on a plane behind noticed
smoke and what may have been flames coming from the left rear
engine. The crew can't see the rear-mounted engines.
   ``The aircraft is equipped with a mechanism that allows the crew
to discharge a fire retardant chemical into the engine
compartment,'' Gibbons said.
   Passengers were directed to other flights and mechanics checked
over the engine.

<HEAD>DOD Awards Jet Contract for Kuwait</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McDonnell Douglas Corp. received a $140
million advance acquisition contract to build 40 F-A-18 Hornet jet
aircraft for the government of Kuwait, the Pentagon announced on
Tuesday.
   The contract covers equipment purchases that were worked out
several years ago under the foreign military sales program, a
Pentagon spokesman said.
   The work is to be performed by the McDonnell Aircraft Co. in St.
Louis, Mo., and is expected to be completed in September 1993, a
Pentagon statement said.
   ``This was worked out some time ago. The contract has just
finally been signed,'' said Pentagon spokesman, Navy Lt. Cmdr. Ken
Satterfield.
   The contract involves two versions of the aircraft, 32 F-A-18Cs
and eight F-A-18Ds, the statement said.
   A separate contract, also being awarded to McDonnell Douglas,
covers a $5.4 million order for the technical publications for the
Kuwait F-A-18 aircraft.
   The F-A-18 is a multi-role jet that performs both fighter and
attack roles.
   The overall cost of the program is around $1.2 billion,
Satterfield said.
   Despite the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the program is going
forward because ``the government of Kuwait still exists'' and in
the hopes it will regain its territory from Iraq, the spokesman
said.

   Police who scrambled to find a gunman
after a flood of callers reported gunshots got their man _ but it
turned out to be a car.
   The reports that shattered the Labor Day calm in this small
coastal town turned out to be backfires from Wayne Elliott
Richards' ill-tuned old red Chevrolet.
   About 40 people called to report what they thought were gunshots.
   It turns out Richards, 21, is going to need a lawyer as well as
a mechanic. Police didn't find any weapons when they caught up to
him. But they arrested Richards for investigation of speeding,
evading an officer and failing to provide proof of insurance.

   A new vehicle with legs and feet instead of
wheels is being developed to prowl forests, a mechanical Big Foot
the Agriculture Department said Tuesday will soon undergo field
tests.
   The vehicle ``will soon be strolling about the woods of
southwest Virginia'' near Blacksburg, home of Virginia Polytechnic
Institute and State University, one of the machine's developers,
the department said.
   Products technologist Robert Koeppen of the Forest Service said
the machine could solve some forest management problems while
helping protect forest ecosystems.
   Currently, forest managers depend on rubber-tired vehicles,
which can cause soil compaction, rutting or damage to vegetation,
the agency said. Wheeled vehicles also are limited by terrain that
is too rough, steep, wet or soft.
   The machine, called ``the robotic walking vehicle,'' may
alleviate such problems. For example, it can move sideways, a
maneuver Koeppen said may help drastically reduce damage to forest
soils and vegetation.
   A public unveiling of the machine has been scheduled for Sept.
11 at Virginia Polytechnic, with field tests to begin later this
month. The tests will include the machine's performance on level,
mountainous and simulate low-lying wetland terrain.

<HEAD>Palestinian Leader Says Group Will Not Attack U.S. Targets</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Gulf Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Palestinian guerrilla leader Abul Abbas
said Tuesday his group will not attack U.S. targets in the Middle
East unless American forces strike at Iraq.
   ``Our interests lie in a peaceful settlement of the gulf
crisis,'' he told reporters at his heavily guarded headquarters in
downtown Baghdad.
   ``For the time being, we don't want to give the Americans an
excuse to launch an attack against Iraq,'' he added. ``But if the
Americans wage a battle, it will be a fierce one and all their
interests in the region will be within our reach.''
   The guerrilla leader, whose real name is Mohammed Abbas, heads
the Palestine Liberation Front, a small, radical group within
Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization.
   The group was behind the October 1985 hijacking of the Italian
cruise liner Achille Lauro in which an elderly American passenger,
Leon Klinghoffer, was murdered.
   The PLF also mounted an abortive seaborne raid on Israel in May,
which led President Bush to suspend the U.S.'s 18-month dialogue
with the PLO.
   Western governments have been preparing for terrorist attacks by
Arab militants aligned with Baghdad since U.S. forces and their
allies rushed to the aid of Saudi Arabia following Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait.
   Abbas, sitting below a large poster showing him with Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein, said he expects the Americans to use
``some of their stooges'' in the region to attack American targets
and then blame it on Iraq.
   He said the Americans would use that ``as a pretext ... to
strike Iraq.''
   He said Palestinians back Saddam because he stood up to Israel
and its Western allies.
   He said Saddam's Aug. 12 proposal to leave Kuwait if Israel
withdrew from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and the
Americans left the Persian Gulf ``is the first time the Palestinian
issue has been linked to the world's need for energy and oil.''

<HEAD>Romanian President Criticizes U.S. for Blocking Assistance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Ion Iliescu on Wednesday
accused the United States and other Western countries of waging an
economic war against Romania by blocking loans to the financially
strapped country.
   Iliescu made his remarks to Romanian television during the
second day of an official visit to Yugoslavia.
   He said certain American interests, which he did not name,
dictated U.S. policy toward his country.
   Pressures have been exerted on Western banks to make them
withhold loans to Romania, Iliescu said, without going into
specifics.
   This represents ``an economic war impossible to understand,'' he
said.
   ``Romanians have no illusions as to Western aid,'' Iliescu said.
He added that Romania might find more beneficial economic
cooperation with countries of similar size and interests.
   In contrast, he noted that the West gave preferential treatment
to Nicolae Ceausescu, the Communist dictator toppled and executed
in December, despite his repression of his countrymen.
   Iliescu was alluding to the Most Favored Nation trading status
granted by the United States to Romania for years as a reward for
Ceausescu's relative independence _ particularly in foreign policy
_ from the Soviet Union. Exports of countries with Most Favored
status are subject to lower U.S. tariffs.
   Romania lost its Most Favored Nation status in 1988 when
Ceausescu still held power.
   Last week, Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole, R-Kan., visited
Bucharest with a Senate delegation. Dole insisted Congress will
have to be satisfied that Romania's human rights record is
``exemplary'' before restoring its Most Favored Nation status and
allocating large-scale aid.
   Dole said he was concerned about mass arrests made after
anti-government demonstrations, delays in issuing passports and the
continuing state monopoly over the mass media.
   
   The United States and the European Community froze all but
humanitarian aid to Romanian in June. Romania has the weakest
economy and lowest living standards in the East bloc.
   The aid cutoff was in response to a two-day rampage by loyalist
miners who answered Iliescu's call for help in putting down violent
anti-government protests. The miners beat up journalists and
pedestrians and raided the offices of anti-government parties.
   Iliescu, a former senior Communist official who broke with
Ceausescu, has repeatedly stated his commitment to democracy and
economic reform.
   Iliescu's National Salvation Front came to power during the
revolution that ousted Ceausescu. The Front won an overwhelming
victory in May's multiparty elections.
   Opposition leaders suspect Iliescu and other key figures in the
front of continuing to harbor communist sympathies.

<HEAD>Intelsat Alleges in Suit That Martin Marietta Botched Launch</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with Martin Marietta comment, subbing 3 grafs for

<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Intelsat, the international satellite
organization, has filed a lawsuit seeking $400 million from rocket
builder Martin Marietta for a launch that left a $145 million
satellite in a useless orbit.
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Baltimore, accuses
Martin Marietta of miswiring its Titan 3 rocket and botching the
March 14 launch for which Intelsat paid $115 million.
   Martin Marietta has said a wiring problem caused failure of the
satellite and its attached booster rocket to separate from the
Titan 3 when they reached orbit. As a result, the satellite could
not be sent on to its duty station 22,300 miles above Earth, where
communications satellites operate,
   The satellite, which Intelsat had not insured, will be a total
loss unless it gets a boost. A space shuttle crew will try to
rescue the satellite next year, costing Intelsat another $90
million or so.
   Martin Marietta attempted a pre-emptive strike against Intelsat
in July, asking the federal court to declare that its only legal
only responsibility was to provide a replacement launch.
   Elliott Miller, Martin Marietta's director of corporate
relations, said Intelsat's suit had no merit and that Intelsat had
had an opportunity to buy insurance but declined.
   ``Under the launch services contract between Martin Marietta and
Intelsat, the relationship of the parties for risk of loss is
clearly set forth,'' he said Tuesday. ``The contract provides that
Martin Marietta is not liable for the satellite failure to achieve
orbit.''
   The Intelsat suit alleges Martin Marietta miswired the launch
vehicle ``so that the payload did not and could not separate from
the launch vehicle in response to commands sent by the Martin
Marietta flight computer and computer software.''
   The Titan 3 is designed to carry one or more payloads. On its
first mission in December 1989, it put two satellites into orbit.
Electrical signals were routed to separate first one satellite and
then the other.
   The same wiring was in place for the Intelsat launch, which had
no satellite in the No. 1 position. As a result, the separation
command never reached the satellite that was on board.
   ``Martin Marietta has acknowledged that the launch failure was
caused by this obvious, and readily avoidable, error,'' the
Intelsat suit said, adding that the rocket builder showed
``manifest reckless indifference'' to Intelsat's interests.
   Martin Marietta launched a second satellite for Intelsat in June
without a problem.
   In its suit, Martin Marietta said it might have to go out of the
commercial launch business if it were made to pay damages.
   ``The very viability of Martin Marietta's commercial launch
services business is dependent on a determination of its rights
under the contract,'' it said.
   But in its countersuit, Intelsat noted that Martin Marietta was
considering dropping out anyway, having told its stockholders in an
annual report that production of Titan 3 rockets ``will depend upon
the market for heavy-lift launch vehicles.''

<HEAD>Milwaukee Students Take State Money to Private Schools</HEAD>

   When buses rolled up Tuesday at schools
throughout the city for the start of another academic year, nearly
400 students embarked on a new journey: to private schools with
taxpayers' help.
   The experimental Milwaukee Parental Choice Program, eventually
expected to help send 1,000 poor Milwaukee students to
non-sectarian private schools, survived two court challenges led by
the state's chief education official.
   The debut drew raves from parents whose children qualified,
including single mother Yvette Harris, who attended a private
school as a child but could not afford the same for her three
children.
   ``For my 12-year-old to go to a private school, it's really a
privilege for us. They were always praised for a quality education.
I couldn't afford the tuition at all,'' said Ms. Harris.
   She enrolled her eldest, Jamal, in seventh grade at Juanita
Virgil Academy and Josh Jr., 4, and Angelica, 3, in preschool under
the program, which pays up to $2,500 for each child's tuition.
   The state vouchers completely covered the tuitions, said Ms.
Harris, who attended a parochial elementary school in Chicago.
   The program's funding is deducted from the operating budget of
the Milwaukee Public Schools system, which has about 98,200
students.
   Families not more than 75 percent above the federal poverty
level, which allows a $12,000 annual income for a family of four,
are eligible. Parents receive state vouchers that are redeemed by
the schools.
   The plan's chief sponsor, state Rep. Polly Williams, greeted
pupils at Urban Day elementary school, where more than 100 new
students enrolled with the help of the state. The school has a
total enrollment of 500.
   Ms. Williams, a Democrat, said the program gives hope to poor
students who suffered in crowded public schools that reinforce the
cycle of poverty.
   ``These kids are getting something out of these schools they
can't get in the public school system. Every child who walks
through those doors is expected to achieve. It's going to make a
difference in the lives of a lot of children,'' she said.
   Among the school's new students was Antonio Johnson, an
eighth-grader. ``I'm going to try to do the best I can do,'' he
said.
   The Legislature authorized $2.5 million for the program _ enough
for 1,000 students _ but only 390 were registered in private
schools by Tuesday. The eight participating private schools said
they were forced to reject hundreds of students because of limited
classroom space and teaching staff.
   Urban Day administrator Zakiya Courtney said the school lost
students in recent years because of rising tuition, which now costs
$3,300 a year.
   ``Private school has basically been afforded to those who can
afford it. If a low-income parent couldn't make the sacrifice, they
couldn't do it. We advocated for this program,'' she said.
   More than 300 students applied at the school under the program,
but most were denied entrance to retain average class sizes of 20
students, said Courtney.
   Although the program was praised by Gov. Tommy G. Thompson and
the Bush administration, State Schools Superintendent Herbert J.
Grover opposed it, saying it undermined public schools.
   Grover joined a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the
program on the grounds that the private schools were private
endeavors and therefore ineligible for state funds.
   Dane County Circuit Court and a state appeals court rejected the
suit.
   Critics argue that the private schools are not accountable to
the state.
   The National Association for Advancement of Colored People,
which also joined the lawsuit, said the program helps only a few
students while ignoring the thousands who will remain in public
schools.
   ``It's crazy to talk about 1,000 students when you've got 64,000
or better students in the Milwaukee Public schools who need help,''
said Felmers Chaney, president of the NAACP's Milwaukee chapter.
   Proponents counter that the program may encourage public schools
to improve.
   Plans that allow parents more choice on where to send their
children to school have gained momentum in the last five years.
   Minnesota and Iowa were among the first to offer tax credits to
parents sending their children to private schools. Wisconsin's
voucher system is the nation's first will likely be expanded in
Wisconsin and duplicated through the nation, Ms. Williams said.
   ``Public schools are shaking in their boots. They're terrified.
They don't know how they're going to stop the movement,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Authorities on Tuesday uncovered a
clandestine mass grave containing the remains of an estimated 1,700
bodies _ mostly poor people but also some political foes of
Brazil's former military dictatorship.
   The skeletons were packed in blue plastic bags and buried in an
unmarked section of the hillside cemetery of Perus, a working-class
suburb of Sao Paulo, the country's largest city.
   Officials found the bones while checking up on what had happened
to remains of paupers who died with no identification in the early
1970s.
   ``Up to 50 of the dead could be former political prisoners and
opponents of the (1964-85) military regime,'' Luis Eduardo
Greenhalgh, deputy mayor of Sao Paulo and a human rights activist,
told The Associated Press.
   He said at least six already had been identified as
``disappeared'' political activists, presumably killed by the
dictatorship.
   Greenhalgh said others may have been victims of police-backed
death squads that summarily executed suspected criminals in the
1960s and '70s.
   Cemetery director Antonio Pires Eustaquio said most of the dead
were paupers buried in 1971-72, whose identities were unknown at
the time.
   By law, such remains must be unearthed and placed in a bone
depository after three years, Eustaquio said.
   He said, ``Cemetery records showed the removal took place but
did not indicate what had been done with the remains. I
investigated and discovered the mass grave.''

<HEAD>Gorbachev Said Ready to Present Radical Economic Reform Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, under pressure
from rival reformers like Boris Yeltsin, personally will present a
sweeping economic plan to the Soviet parliament as early as Monday,
a spokesman said Tuesday.
   Gorbachev apparently has abandoned a moderate plan drafted by
Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov. Instead, he will present
a plan drafted in large part by Stanislav Shatalin, a reformer who
sits on Gorbachev's Presidential Council, said presidential
spokesman Vitaly N. Ignatenko.
   Shatalin's ideas were embodied in a reform program presented to
the parliament of the Russian federation on Monday.
   Ignatenko and other Gorbachev aides say Gorbachev and Yeltsin,
the president of the Russian federation _ largest of the 15 Soviet
republics, agree on the general shape of the reforms.
   A moderate plan presented last spring by Ryzhkov was rejected by
the national parliament after the proposal touched off a run of
panic buying, and he was drafting another moderate approach for
presentation this fall.
   The decision to bypass the premier this time ``does not mean
that Ryzhkov is no longer trusted by the president,'' Ignatenko
said at a news conference.
   The parliament of the Russian federation was expected to approve
Yeltsin's proposal next Tuesday.
   The soonest Gorbachev could present his own plan to the national
parliament would be at the opening session scheduled for Monday,
the day after he was due back from a summit in Helsinki with
President Bush.
   Ignatenko skirted the issue of whether Gorbachev would in fact
embrace the plan presented by Yeltsin, saying, ``There is a general
consensus now that the program approved by Mikhail Sergeyevich
Gorbachev should serve as the basis of future economic reform.''
   He said that each of the Soviet republics would have a chance to
consider the proposed reforms.
   ``A single program will be submitted for them to approve, based
on what we call the Professor Shatalin plan,'' Ignatenko told a
news conference.
   But he did not specify whether he expected the Russian
federation _ which includes half the Soviet people and two-thirds
its land mass _ to approve the Shatalin plan before Gorbachev has a
chance to offer it for national consideration.
   Asked how Gorbachev and Yeltsin would reconcile their plans,
Ignatenko said there were only three main areas of disagreement:
``The rate or pace of reform, the sequence of the reforms, and the
reform price-setting machinery.''
   Although those disagreements appear major, Ignatenko said,
``There is no great difference between the two programs. They are
not antagonistic or irreconcilable.''
   He said the differences were ``very fine points that should be
taken care of within the next few days. Our union republics will
receive the program for discussion and approval. Every union
republic is entitled to develop along its own lines and to amend
those programs as they see fit.''
   Copies of neither the Yeltsin plan nor that under consideration
by Gorbachev were available to the Western press. Members of the
Russian parliament said they had not yet seen a full copy of the
250-page report presented by Yeltsin on Monday.
   However, a version seen by The Associated Press said that it
would relegate to the central government, headed by Gorbachev, only
those powers given to it by the 15 republics.
   The Kremlin would lose its power to levy taxes and would have to
rely on dues from the republics. But the central government would
retain responsibility for defense, strengthening the currency and
disaster relief.
   Members of a visiting American delegation that met Tuesday with
a top Gorbachev economic adviser, Nikolai Petrakov, said the
central leadership also was leaning toward such a plan. It would
entail creation of a central bank, similar to the U.S. Federal
Reserve, to control the currency supply.

   Next weekend's U.S.-Soviet summit will give
Presidents Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev a chance to prod
slow-moving conventional-arms talks as well as forge ``an even
stronger bond'' of opposition to Iraq's Saddam Hussein,
administration officials said Tuesday.
   Bush also is considering adding add a stop in Europe to brief
NAT0 allies on his way back from Sunday's superpower summit in
Helsinki, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Administration officials said planners were focusing on a Monday
session in Brussels.
   Originally, Bush planned to return directly to Washington from
the capital of Finland. But Fitzwater said the president would like
to be able to brief allied leaders on the summit if possible, just
as he did after his meeting last December with Gorbachev at Malta.
After that earlier summit, Bush stopped briefly in Brussels to
brief NATO.
   ``There is some discussion about whether we need to make another
stop,'' Fitzwater said. ``Pack another pair of underwear,'' he
added in an aside to reporters who cover the president.
   Bush, on his first day back from an often-interrupted three-week
vacation in Maine, met with his Cabinet and other top advisers to
discuss the upcoming summit.
   ``A new foundation for world order is being built and the
spadework begins in Helsinki,'' Fitzwater declared. ``It is
somewhat ironic that the prospect of war is forging a new blueprint
for world peace. Both leaders will want to apply some new
brushstrokes to this emerging picture.''
   Most public attention has focused on what the two leaders might
say on the subject of Iraq's invasion and continuing occupation of
Kuwait. But arms talks also were sure to be discussed.
   Although negotiations on troop reductions are moving along well,
officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said there still
are serious problems in negotiating reductions on cuts in aircraft
and artillery.
   Both countries hope to wind up the Conventional Forces in Europe
(CFE) pact in time for November's planned 35-country Paris summit
of all European nations plus the United States and Canada.
   ``The two presidents will not be negotiating details of this
agreement,'' Fitzwater said. ``But they will be attempting to add
the impetus that will assure that that agreement is ready to sign
and that the summit can be held.''
   The two leaders will also likely discuss progress on a treaty to
reduce long-range nuclear weapons. But officials said those talks
appear to be moving along smoothly, and less of a push is needed
for them than for the conventional arms talks.
   Soviet economic reforms will also be on the agenda, Fitzwater
and other officials said. In particular, Bush is expected to bring
up a study by the International Monetary Fund _ commissioned at
last July's economic summit of industrial democracies in Houston _
of Soviet needs, the officials said.
   Bush and Gorbachev will also discuss regional hotspots,
including Cambodia and Afghanistan, officials said.
   Still, officials stressed that the main purpose of the summit
was to provide a highly visible show of superpower solidarity in
bringing pressure to bear on Saddam to end his month-old occupation
of Kuwait.
   ``This summit should provide an even stronger bond of unified
opposition to Saddam. It also offers an important opportunity for
both leaders to assess superpower interests in the post-Cold War
period,'' Fitzwater said.
   The administration announced on Tuesday that Bush will ask
Congress to forgive Egypt's $7 billion military debt to the United
States and was looking at possible aid packages for other Middle
Eastern nations that have helped out in enforcing the embargo.
   In all, 22 nations have contributed equipment or troops or both
to the U.S.-led military effort to enforce the embargo.
   Bush will leave Washington Friday night, meet with Finland's
President Mauno Koivisto on Saturday and then devote most of Sunday
to his talks with Gorbachev.
   These include a morning session, a luncheon, an afternoon
session and a joint news conference.
   ``We envision that a good deal of time will be spent on the
Persian Gulf in these meetings,'' Fitzwater said.
   White House advance teams went to Helsinki Monday night to begin
meetings with their Soviet counterparts on logistics.
   The White House had no immediate reaction to Tuesday's proposal
by the Soviets for an international conference to discuss the
Persian Gulf crisis, the Arab-Israeli dispute and the Lebanese
civil war.
   Gorbachev seems likely to bring that proposal up at the weekend
summit, however.
   As to Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze's assertion
that the summit ``will mark a major milestone on the road toward
resolving the crisis in the Persian Gulf,'' Fitzwater said:
   ``We agree with the Soviets that it will be important and
constructive.''
   Fitzwater likened the structure of the Helsinki summit _ Bush's
third meeting as president with Gorbachev _ with last December's
three-day summit in Malta in the Mediterranean.
   ``President Bush liked the unstructured agenda nature of the
Malta summit. We will attempt to approximate that again in the
Helsinki summit. He intends to preserve a considerable time for
general discussions,''

<TEXT>
   Nicolae Ceausescu's youngest son is
being treated for cirrhosis of the liver as a court considers his
role in dozens of deaths during the December revolution that
resulted in the downfall of his dictator father.
   Nicu Ceausescu, who faces charges of ``complicity in genocide,''
celebrated his 39th birthday Saturday with relatives coming to his
bed at Fundeni Hospital. Police guarded his door.
   ``The personnel treat me most carefully,'' Ceausescu was quoted
as saying Tuesday by the state Rompres news agency.
   Lucian Buligescu, head of the hospital's liver department, said
he hoped for ``considerable improvement'' in his patient's
condition, which is attributed to alcohol problems. He said
Ceausescu felt depressed.
   Ceausescu, former Communist Party chief of Sibiu, 150 miles
northwest of Bucharest, allegedly ordered the shootings of
townspeople who rose up against his father. He is also charged with
illegal possession of firearms.
   Eighty-nine people died in Sibiu as the army and anti-Ceausescu
activists fought against secret police troops loyal to the dictator.
   The younger Ceausescu, who was said to be a heavy drinker,
suffered a stab wound to his liver on Dec. 22, the day of his
arrest. His father and mother, Elena Ceausescu, were executed on
Dec. 25.
   Sentencing is expected this month.

<HEAD>Former Nationalist Spy Pilots Return Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two former Nationalist air force pilots
who were captured during spy missions for Taiwan and U.S.
intelligence returned home Tuesday, more than 25 years after they
were shot down in China.
   Yeh Chang-ti and Chang Li-yi were greeted at the airport by
their families and former colleagues. ``It's nice to be home
again,'' said Yeh.
   Yeh and Chang, both in their early 60s, have told reporters they
wished to regain their status as majors in the air force to serve
the country.
   Defense Minister Chen Li-an said Tuesday the two men's military
status could not be restored because of their age. Chen said,
however, his ministry would provide necessary compensation for Yeh
and Chang.
   Military officials said they welcomed the pilots' return.
   Both Yeh and Chang were members of the ``Black Cat'' squadron, a
secret unit of Taiwan's air force formed in 1961 by selected combat
pilots. The now defunct squadron's missions were to fly U.S.-made
Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft over China to gather military
information for the Central Intelligence Agency and the Nationalist
government in Taiwan.
   The Nationalists, driven to Taiwan in 1949 by Communist forces
in China, had vowed to rule mainland China again. The United States
switched its diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979.
   Yeh was shot down in 1963 while flying over Jiangxi province in
eastern China, and Chang was downed in 1965 on a special research
flight over northern China.
   They were captured and sentenced to forced labor, but were
released from China in 1983. However, their request to return home
was rejected as Taiwan authorities regarded the release as a
Chinese propaganda move.
   The two then stayed in the United States with the help of the
CIA. Yeh is a resident of Houston, and Chang lives in Washington.
   Four Nationalist pilots were killed during spy missions over
China and six others died in accidents during training in the
United States before authorities disbanded the squadron in 1974.

<HEAD>Austria Restricts Travel by Poles; Sends Troops to Hungary Border</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Austria said Tuesday it was reimposing a
visa requirement for Poles and sending troops to the Hungarian
border to help stem an influx of East European refugees.
   The Interior Ministry said Polish citizens would once again need
visas to travel to Austria. The visa requirement takes effect on
Friday and will be in force for six months.
   The Polish Foreign Ministry issued a brief statement expressing
``regret and surprise'' over Austria's decision. In retaliation,
the Foreign Ministry announced it was introducing a visa
requirement for Austrians for the same period.
   Austria has not required visas from Poles since 1988. It was the
only visa-free travel destination in Western Europe for Poles
besides West Berlin, which will also change its regulations
following the Oct. 3 German unification.
   Austria now finds itself facing a growing influx of East
Europeans over the past few months, particularly Poles and
Romanians who endure severe economic hardships at home.
   Austria says that with the exception of some Romanians, most of
the new arrivals do not qualify for refugee status because they no
longer face political persecution at home.
   The main Traiskirchen refugee camp south of Vienna is currently
accomodating 2,000 people _ double its capacity. The transfer of
refugees to other facilities is slow.
   In an effort to prevent Romanians and other East Europeans from
illegally crossing the Hungarian-Austrian border, Austria said it
would send 1,500 soldiers in the next two days to the border region
to assist customs officials.
   Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said the troops would be deployed for
an initial period of 10 weeks.
   Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak said Monday the soldiers would
be limited to patrolling the border and would only use their
weapons in self-defense.
   The government said that if necessary soldiers may also be
dispatched to patrol the borders with other Eastern European
countries. Austria is also bordered by Czechoslovakia and
Yugoslavia.
   In its statement, the Polish Foreign Ministry admitted some
Poles have engaged in illegal trade or work in Austria, but
stressed that such phenomena ``cannot be a basis for making a
decision limiting the freedom of travel of all citizens of both
countries.''
   Polish Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski also criticized
the Austrian decision.
   ``It is discrepant with our policy aiming at introducing a full
freedom of movement of people in Europe,'' Skubiszewski said in an
interview for an evening radio newscast.
   Austrian authorities had threatened to restore the visa
requirement for Poles earlier this year. In an effort to meet
Austrian concerns, Poland imposed strict customs controls and
invited Austrian customs officials to join their counterparts at
Polish border crossings.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Wladyslaw Klaczynski noted that more
and more Western countries were lifting visa requirements for
Hungarians and Czechoslovakians. But he said no Western country was
currently planning to do the same for Poles.
   Klaczynski said the Austrian decision amounted to ``a kind of
discrimination against Poles.''
   ``We do not deny that it has its cause but this cause does not
justify such a decision. We should aim at removing barriers not at
erecting them,'' he told The Associated Press.

   Teachers went on strike Tuesday in school districts in Michigan,
Washington, Rhode Island and Pennsylvania, and New Orleans teachers
voted to strike in two weeks unless their demands are met.
   College professors walked out in contract disputes at Wayne
State University in Detroit and Temple University in Philadelphia.
A strike continued at the University of Bridgeport in Connecticut.
   In all, the strikes disrupted education for a total of about
60,000 students in Saginaw, Mich., Yakima, Wash., and outside
Seattle and Everett, Wash.
   School openings are also threatened at three smaller districts
in Cheboygan, Mich., North Kingston, R.I., and Ligonier, Pa., where
school starts Wednesday and teachers have gone on strike. Those
districts have a total of about 10,000 students.
   A strike in New Orleans, where school started Tuesday, could
affect about 85,000 pupils. Teachers there overwhelmingly approved
a strike pledge for Sept. 17 in a voice vote Tuesday morning. They
want the school district to pay more of their health insurance
bills and raise the salaries of teachers' aides. The teachers
dropped a demand that their own salaries be raised.
   In Yakima, school officials said they would show videotaped
lessons to the 12,000 pupils affected by the strike. Teachers urged
parents to keep their children at home during the strike.
   The Yakima teachers struck despite a restraining order from a
judge, who prohibited them from striking, picketing or engaging in
``other acts disruptive to the normal school process.''
   ``We are not afraid,'' said Melanie Mitchell, president of the
teachers' union, the Yakima Education Association. ``We made a
decision which we are committed to, and the district is not going
to scare us back into the classroom.''
   The union said the sticking points in contract negotiations
included class size, evaluation of teachers and special education
issues. The district characterized the remaining contract points as
money issues.
   The other Washington strikes affected 22,500 pupils in the Lake
Washington School District in the Seattle suburbs of Kirkland,
Juanita and Redmond; and 9,100 pupils in Mukilteo, south of Everett.
   At the three colleges, Wayne State, Temple and Bridgeport,
administrators pledged to hold classes without the striking
instructors.
   ``The university will be open,'' said President Peter Liacouras
at Temple, which has an undergraduate enrollment of 31,000.
University spokesman George Ingram said some classes were held
Tuesday, but others had to be canceled for lack of teachers.
   Similarly, Wayne State administrators said they would try to
hold classes this week despite a strike by the American Association
of University Professors, which represents 1,500 instructors, or
about 35 percent of the faculty. Wayne State has an enrollment of
30,000.
   Faculty members turned down annual raises of 5 percent at Temple
at 4.8 percent at Wayne.
   At the University of Bridgeport, which has an undergraduate
enrollment of about 4,000, college President Janet Greenwood said
replacement workers _ including faculty _ had been hired to keep
the school ``fully operational.''
   The strike by all three campus unions began Saturday, but
maintenance and cafeteria workers stayed on the job while students
moved in during the weekend. Classes begin Wednesday night.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney confirmed
Tuesday that the United States has deployed combat aircraft in
several smaller Persian Gulf states as part of the buildup of
forces to protect Saudi Arabia.
   He conceded that those aircraft deployments amount to a
committment to defend the countries involved.
   The announcement came as additional combat-ready forces
continued to flow into the Persian Gulf region.
   Ships carrying a Marine expeditionary unit from Okinawa,
equipped with a squadron of assault and cargo helicopters, have
arrived in position near the Saudi peninsula. Pentagon spokesman
Lt. Col. Stuart Wagner said the 2,200-man unit left Okinawa several
weeks ago.
   Meanwhile, Pentagon sources said the Persian Gulf nation of
Bahrain had agreed to accept American F-A-18 jets _ which can
either fight other warplanes or attack ground targets _ along with
A-6 bombers and AV-8 Harrier jump jets. Those planes are flown by
the Navy and the Marines.
   Also, F-16 air-to-air fighters have been deployed in the United
Arab Emirates and F-15 ground attack jets in Oman, the sources
said. Those planes are flown by the Air Force.
   The United Arab Emirates had announced several weeks ago that it
had agreed to accept U.S. KC-130 cargo and transport planes, while
Qatar announced last week it would allow American F-16 fighter jets
that had been stationed in Spain to be positioned on its territory.
   Cheney, in an interview on ABC-TVs ``Good Morning America,''
declined to specify exactly which Persian Gulf nations had agreed
to station U.S. aircraft on their soil.
   But he confirmed that attack planes and bombers had been
positioned in nations along the southern shore of the Persian Gulf,
the location of Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and the United Arab Emirates.
   ``The exact degree of participation by each of them varies and
there are obviously also some sensititivities on their part in
terms of extent to which they are willing to acknowledge their
cooperation,'' Cheney said. ``But I think it would be fair to say
that there is more cooperation from those Persian Gulf states today
than there has ever been before in terms of our mutual security
efforts in the region.''
   In another interview on CNN, Cheney said the bombers and war
planes were ``not only deployed in Saudi Arabia, but in some of the
other nations in the region who are friends and allies of ours''
and who were cooperating in Operation Desert Shield, the deployment
of forces to protect Saudi Arabia from Iraq.
   The secretary noted that most of those nations in the past have
refused to accept any U.S. military presence but now all are
helping out.
   Some permit transport aircraft, some permit combat aircraft, and
``in some places we have access arrangements or naval arrangements.
They are cooperating to one degree or another,'' he said.
   Cheney said he was able to negotiate the variety of agreements
during his trip to the region last month.
   Asked whether the presence of U.S. forces amounts to an implicit
commitment to also defend those countries, Cheney said, ``I think
it does.''
   Those countries warmed toward military cooperation with the
United States during the eight-year war between Iran and Iraq, when
U.S. warships protected Kuwaiti tankers from Iranian attack in the
Persian Gulf.
   The Marine expeditionary unit is capable of conducting commando
operations and contains a helicopter element including a variety of
AH-1 Cobra gunships, CH-53 Sea Stallion assault choppers and CH-46
Sea Knight transport helicopters.

   Saddam Hussein warned he would regard foreigners
hiding in Kuwait as spies, but Iraqi censors cut the ``dire
threat'' from his interview with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a producer
said Tuesday.
   The deletion was the second case in four days of Iraqi
censorship of U.S. television reports from Baghdad, despite the
Iraqi president's recent attempts to use television to justify his
Aug. 2 takeover of Kuwait.
   On Monday, Iraqi censors blacked out part of an NBC report that
showed foreign hostages. ``NBC Nightly News'' aired the report,
including the sudden blackout the censors imposed near the end of
the piece as it was being transmitted via satellite from Baghdad.
   Earlier, Iraqi censors cut eight to 10 minutes from Jackson's
interview Friday with Saddam, according to Av Westin, executive
producer of ``Inside Edition,'' a syndicated series that paid for
Jackson's trip to Iraq last week.
   ``The dire threat was that anybody who did not turn themselves
in within 10 days would be treated as a spy,'' Westin said. ``It
was that they would be treated as spies and dealt with as spies ...
that was eliminated from the tape.''
   But Saddam made no threats of harm to them, said Kenneth Walker,
a former ABC News correspondent who accompanied Jackson on his
90-minute interview with the Iraqi president.
   Walker said the warning came in the context of Jackson's
questions about foreign women and children in Kuwait.
   He quoted Jackson as telling Saddam several times that these
foreigners may not know of Saddam's previous offers to release them
or were too terrified to surrender to Iraqi forces.
   After Jackson urged Saddam to jointly appear with him on Baghdad
TV to announce a specific plan for the release of foreign women and
children, Walker said, ``Saddam finally said something like:
   `Well, I have good feelings for children. But if these people do
not come forward, they will be regarded as spies.' ''
   Walker said Saddam did not make clear if he were speaking only
of the women and children or of male foreigners, but that it could
be assumed he was referring to all three categories.
   However, in a Tuesday broadcast of ``Inside Edition,'' Walker,
after checking with two American colleagues were with him during
Jackson's interview, quoted Saddam as saying of foreigners in
Kuwait:
   ``Any adults who don't come forward now will be treated as
spies.''
   Walker and Westin said the censorship wasn't discovered until
Monday night, when the staff of the syndicated ``Inside Edition''
was editing tapes of Jackson's interview.
   Another missing portion, Westin said, involved Jackson's
questions about providing fuel, water and medicine for Americans
trapped at the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait. The embassy has defied
Saddam's order to close.
   Walker said Jackson's interview was taped by three TV crews from
Iraq's state-run television facilities. The tapes that proved to be
censored were given to Jackson's entourage a day after the
interview, he said.
   There had been no conditions set for the interview, and was
there no warning that censorship would occur, he said.
   Jackson's meeting with Saddam came three days after the Iraqi
leader was interviewed by CBS anchorman Dan Rather. Iraqi TV crews
also taped that interview, but cut nothing from it, CBS spokeswoman
Donna Dees said.
   ``Inside Edition,'' which paid $125,000 for Jackson and his
14-member entourage to go to Iraq for the interview and other
reports, was to start a four-part series on the trip Tuesday.
   Jackson returned to Washington from Iraq on Sunday with 47 freed
Americans who had been held hostage in Iraq and Kuwait.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater praised him Tuesday,
saying President Bush ``is pleased by Jesse's success in bringing
back Americans and we're grateful he (Jackson) was able to make
those arrangements.''
   Jackson's own ``The Jesse Jackson Show'' is to premiere this
month. That show is syndicated by Warner Bros., a rival of King
World, which syndicates ``Inside Edition.''

   Illiteracy and child abuse most
concern this year's Miss America contestants, each of whom must
choose an issue to emphasize if she wins the pageant.
   The top concerns also include, in order of preference: care for
the elderly, drug abuse, physical fitness, the environment, arts in
education, volunteerism, cancer education and motivating youth.
   Each of the 50 contestants must list three topics and promise to
focus on one if crowned Miss America 1991 on Saturday. The
requirement was first made last year and Miss America 1990 Debbye
Turner chose ``motivating youth to excellence.''
   Miss Georgia Darla Michele Pruett promised to promote literacy,
saying ``poverty and crime are all part of illiteracy.''
   Miss Tennessee Dana Brown said she chose child abuse because she
worked with victims.
   ``I've seen hopeless situations,'' she said. ``It's a problem no
one is willing to discuss. People think there's nothing they can
do, but there is something they can do.''
   Other contestants chose issues that affected them or their
families.
   Miss Pennsylvania Marla Wynne said she would promote cancer
education and prevention because cancer struck 11 members of her
family, including her mother.
   ``I almost felt obligated to stop this,'' she said.
   Miss Nebraska Michelle Ebadi, the daughter of Iranian
immigrants, hoped to boost American's awareness of those of other
ethnic groups. Miss Louisiana Linnea Marie Fayard, whose father
gave a kidney to her uncle, wants to encourage organ donation.
   Miss Arizona Kimberly Hoskins said her grandparents made her
aware of the problems facing elderly Americans.
   Miss Arkansas Karissa Rushing, a ballet dancer for 15 years,
said she hoped schools would emphasize arts education.
   ``I'm not saying everybody should love opera or participate in
ballet or theater,'' Miss Rushing said. ``But it does teach
children critical thinking and how to come up with new ideas.''
   Others said the environment deserved special attention.
   ``Let's look at our responsibility here,'' said Miss Michigan
Victoria Fair. ``It's our obligation to preserve the earth. We just
can't hop on Mars.''

<TEXT>
   Twenty-five Americans were among nearly 300
Western women and children to arrive here Tuesday from Baghdad on
three Iraqi Airways planes.
   The last flight to arrive just before midnight (5 p.m. EDT)
brought 150 people, including the 25 Americans, 44 French, 36
British, four Australians and two Canadian women and children. They
had been detained in Iraq and Kuwait since the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   One of the flights that arrived earlier in the day included 135
West Germans among its passengers, and the other brought 170
people, mainly Arab nationals.
   A total of 175 Western nationals were expected to leave Amman
early Wednesday aboard a Virgin Atlantic airlines jumbo jet.
   The jumbo had landed in Amman a few hours earlier with 30 tons
of food and other supplies for the tens of thousands of Asian
evacuees from Kuwait stranded in squalid camps in Jordan.
   ``We heard there was a potentially catastrophic problem in
Jordan with young and old people dying and we had to do something
before it was too late,'' Richard Branson, the British owner of the
airline who flew in on the jet told reporters on arrival.
   Shortly after his arrival, Branson and his crew were thanked by
Jordan's American-born wife Queen Noor, who went aboard the plane.
   ``We are grateful, we desperately need all this,'' the queen
told Branson, pointing at sacks of wheat slung on top of the
scarlet first-class seats aboard the plane.
   ``We will get this to the really desperate areas and this kind
of action that you've done is tremendous help,'' she added.
   Branson said later he ``was upset'' because he made 200 seats
available to one Asian embassy to fly evacuees out of Amman, but a
bureaucratic foulup meant the seats went unused.
   He said he had provided the United Nations with a list of
airlines and planes available for charter for a massive airlift to
fly home the estimated 100,000 impoverished Asian nationals
stranded in Jordan.
   Mothers emerged from the planes with sleeping infants and
shouldering older children who looked confused.
   ``I feel great,'' said a young American, George Issa, wearing a
football jersey.
   Asked what he thought of Baghdad, American Taleb Subah said,
``Better than Kuwait, I tell you that.''
   ``Kuwait was a living hell,'' said the Davenport, Iowa,
teen-ager. ``You go to sleep on bombing and you wake up to it. ...
It is like Vietnam. I saw dead people all over, they throw them in
the trash.''
   An elderly American woman refused to say anything, except, ``I
am so tired.'' She kept walking past reporters.
   Most people were taken directly from the arriving airliners to
the VIP lounge at the Queen Alia airport, where counselors and
diplomats talked to them.
   Asked if she had been afraid, Sheila Russell, from Northampton,
England, said, ``I never saw an angry man.''
   But when asked if she was happy to leave, she answered, ``I left
my husband behind.''
   Another British woman, Belinda Quinn, seemed overjoyed at her
release. She said, ``I kept thinking every minute that the plane
(departure) will be canceled.''
   One woman was asked what she would remember of it all?
   ``Just the gunfire and the explosions,'' she said, declining to
give her name.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said last week he would allow
Western women and children to leave, but not the men. More than 700
Western detainees _ women, children and a few ailing men _ left
aboard two Iraqi Airways flights on Saturday. Some evacuees also
have traveled across the desert to Jordan.
   But the departures of others have been complicated by Iraq's
refusal to allow foreign airlines to land in Baghdad and by long
delays in processing their exit permits. About 11,000 Westerners
are now believed stranded in Kuwait and Iraq.
   Earlier Tuesday, hundreds more Westerners headed across the
desert in buses hoping they too would be able to catch flights from
Baghdad to freedom.
   The bus convoy, carrying about 300 Britons, left occupied Kuwait
on Tuesday and was headed for the Iraqi capital.
   The British-organized bus convoy left Kuwait at about 5:25 a.m.,
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd told reporters in Saudi
Arabia.
   The foreign secretary said 148 women and 150 children were on
the 500-mile trip, traveling in a convoy of seven buses and a car,
he said. In London, a Foreign Office spokesman put the figure at
150 women and 156 children.
   William Waldegrave, the British Foreign Office's second-ranking
official, had estimated the convoy would take 10-12 hours to reach
Baghdad. But he noted a previous convoy from Kuwait took 28 hours.

   Two new studies of obesity and high blood
pressure among children produced advice that sounds a lot like the
admonitions of a strict parent: Watch what you eat and quit
watching so much TV.
   Doctors studying a group of poor children in New York concluded
that the children's blood pressure depended in part on how much
they weighed and exercised. Bad childhood habits could carry over
to cause high blood pressure or heart disease when the children
grow up, the researchers warned.
   ``There is evidence cardiovascular disease originates during
childhood,'' said the New York study, which is published in
Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
   A second study, a review of national data by the Harvard School
of Public Health and Tufts New England Medical Center, found that
the more television obese children and adolescents watch, the less
likely they are to lose weight.
   ``Diet, exercise and restriction of television viewing and other
sedentary activities all appear necessary to halt the fattening of
America,'' said that report, which was published in Wednesday's
edition of the Journal of the American Dietetic Association.
   The New York study was the first to examine the separate and
combined effects of fitness and fatness in young inner-city
children, said Bernard Gutin and his colleagues at Columbia
University.
   Over the last five years, the researchers studied 216 children
ages 5 and 6 recruited from clinics, day-care centers and a
hospital. The children, 91 percent of whom where Hispanic, came
from poor families.
   Researchers took the children's blood pressure, tested their
aerobic fitness on a treadmill and assessed their obesity by
measuring their bodies and skin folds, the report said. It
concluded that much of the difference in their blood pressures
related to how fat and how fit they were.
   While previous studies have shown that obesity and lack of
fitness contribute to cardiovascular problems in adults, ``it has
never been shown before in children this young,'' said Gutin,
professor of applied physiology and education at Columbia
University's teachers college.
   ``We think of blood pressure as something we worry about as
adults, but it seems we have to worry about it when children are
young,'' he said in a telephone interview Tuesday. ``Children are
probably suffering damage to their coronary arteries even now.''
   The Harvard study on television viewing grew from a second
review of national data collected between 1963 and 1980. That data
showed obesity increased by 46 percent among children and
adolescents through the years, though calorie intake hadn't risen
proportionally, said dietician Lilian W.Y. Cheung.
   She and other researchers went over the data again, focusing on
1,900 children living throughout the United States, said Cheung,
director of the Harvard Nutrition and Fitness Project.
   The chance of becoming fat increased 1.3 percent for each
additional hour of television viewing daily, the report said.
   And the chances a youngster could be ``cured'' of obesity
decreased 6.3 percent with each additional hour of television
viewing daily, the report said. It defined cured as reducing weight
to a desired level and keeping it off for five years.
   Previous studies have shown that watching television promotes
obesity partly because it takes people away from more active
pursuits. Also, television commercials encourage people to eat
high-calorie foods, the study said.

<HEAD>Cars and Other Vehicles Recalled for Too Much Pollution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mitsubishi Motors Corp. is recalling about
92,000 cars and 75,000 trucks and utility vehicles sold for failure
to meet federal exhaust pollution standards, the Environmental
Protection Agency announced Tuesday.
   The cars involved are the 1987 Mitsubishi Mirage and Dodge Colt
and Plymouth Colt models equipped with the 1.5-liter engine.
   The other vehicles are 1986 and 1987 models equipped with the
2-liter engine _ 1986 Dodge and Plymouth Colt Vistas with
four-wheel drive and two-wheel-drive Dodge Ram 50 and Mitsubishi
trucks, and 1987 Dodge and Plymouth Colt Vistas with four-wheel
drive.
   The Dodge and Plymouth models concerned are manufactured by
Mitsubishi.
   The agency said routine testing discovered that the cars emit
more than the permitted about of carbon monoxide, and the trucks
and utility vehicles emit too much carbon monoxide and unburned
fuel.
   Owners will be asked to schedule appointments at Mitsubishi or
Dodge and Plymouth dealers for modifications _ installation of a
new valve in the pollution control system of the cars and changes
in the fuel systems of the trucks and utility vehicles.
   Mitsubishi owners will be notified first and Dodge and Plymouth
owners later, the EPA said.
   Owners of the trucks and utility vehicles will be asked to leave
them with the dealer for a full day because of required adjustments
that can be made only after a warm engine has cooled, the agency
said.

<HEAD>African Force Intervenes to save Ghanaian</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The five-nation African military force
intervened Tuesday to save a foreigner who forced his way out of a
fast-moving car driven by armed men.
   The incident sent journalists diving for cover when one of the
car's occupants chased their Ghanaian hostage on foot and opened
fire. Soldiers of the West African task force, who were camped
nearby, disarmed the gunman and took him into custody.
   It wasn't known immediately whether the gunman was from a
faction of rebels battling to take control of Liberia.
   There was little fighting in the city as the task force moved
cautiously Tuesday to expand areas of the capital under its
control, and a few fishermen ventured into the city to sell fish to
the capital's residents.
   Monrovia residents said incidents like Tuesday's were common,
but in most cases the victims were unable to escape their
executioners.
   The commander of the force, Ghanaian Lt. Gen. Arnold Quainoo,
left for talks with Gambian President Sir Dawda Jawara, who had
dispatched the troops to oppose rebel forces under Charles Taylor.
   Troops loyal to President Samuel Doe and a rebel splinter group
led by Prince Johnson appeared to be observing a truce that began
the day the West African force landed April 24.
   Reports from Lagos, Nigeria, said Nigeria was shipping
additional arms, equipment and medical supplies to the five-nation
force on Tuesday.
   Jawara, who heads the Economic Community of West African States,
also was to meet with officials of Burkina Faso, which has
criticized the intervention and been accused of supporting the
rebels.
   About 3,000 soldiers from Ghana, Nigeria, Guinea, Sierra Leone
and Gambia landed at Monrovia's port in April under orders to end a
civil war that has left at least 5,000 people dead since last
December.
   When they arrived, Monrovia had been isolated and without water
and electricity for two months. There was almost no food.
   The African troops have been attacked by rebels loyal to Taylor,
but were welcomed by Doe and Johnson.
   Taylor has vowed to destroy the five-nation force, and declared
himself president of Liberia. His forces have been unable to
dislodge troops loyal to Doe in Monrovia's eastern suburbs.
   Johnson, who split with Taylor after the rebels invaded Liberia
from the the neighboring Ivory Coast on Dec. 24, also reached
Monrovia and failed to drive Doe from his heavily fortified mansion.
   The United States, meanwhile, continued to evacuate foreigners
from its embassy in Monrovia, said an embassy official who declined
to be further identified. A contingent of U.S. Marines guarded the
embassy.
   Evacuees were being taken to Freetown, Sierra Leone, for flights
to Europe.

   The Democratic and Republican leaders of the
House Armed Services Committee suggested Tuesday that the
administration send Reserve combat units to join active military
forces in the Middle East.
   Committee chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., and the ranking
Republican, Rep. Bill Dickinson, R-Ala., said deploying reservists
in combat roles would provide an important test of their
capabilities and the wisdom of relying on Reserve forces as part of
future defense planning.
   ``We want to see ... how good the combat units are,'' Aspin said
at a news conference. ``This is a test for the future.
   President Bush's callup of Army Reserves has been confined to
support roles, backing up active-duty combat forces in Saudi Arabia.
   Aspin and Dickinson spoke separately, a day after they returned
from a four-day tour of the Middle East as part of a 22-member
delegation.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams, questioned by reporters about
the Reserve issue, declined to say what recommendations are before
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
   Williams said there has been ``a lot of discussion about what
might happen down the road,'' but no decision has been made. It is
expected that it would take at least 90 days to train Army combat
reservists.
   A member of a separate delegation of senators arriving at
Andrews Air Force Base near Washington from a Saudi tour said late
Tuesday afternoon the question of the use of reserve combat units
would be raised when lawmakers meet President Bush on Wednesday.
   ``There's concern that we're putting all this money into combat
reserves and yet they're not being called up,'' said Sen. William
Cohen, R-Maine, a member of the Armed Services Committee.
   Aspin said defense planning for the post-Cold War period has
been based in part on an assumption that Reserve units could be
used in any medium- to large-scale troop deployment. However, he
said, military officials are reluctant to use Reserves in combat
roles.
   He said military leaders, including those in Saudi Arabia, are
skeptical about the use of Reserve combat forces, citing three- or
six-month limitations as one reason. But Aspin said that military
estimates that combat reservists would require up to 60 days
training may be too pessimistic.
   The Reserve callup has been for only a three-month period, but
Aspin and Dickinson said Congress may need give Bush broader
authority to call up reservists and National Guardsmen for up to a
year's service.
   Lawmakers returning from their trip to Bahrain, Egypt and Saudi
Arabia and an inspection of U.S. military operations expressed
widespread support for Bush's response to Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait. Some said the crisis will prompt a new look at how U.S.
military dollars are spent as the nation comes to grips with
growing budget problems.
   The overriding concern among lawmakers was the level of
participation by other nations in Operation Desert Shield and the
campaign to deter Iraqi aggression.
   ``I call on our NATO countries to take a more active role, with
men on the ground,'' House Republican Leader Bob Michel of Illinois
told reporters.
   The lawmakers' comments came as congressional and White House
negotiators prepared for a four-day, closed session on reaching a
deficit-cutting agreement to solve the budget crisis. The session
begins Friday.
   In addition, the full House is scheduled to take up a $283
billion defense bill for fiscal 1991 starting Monday, with planned
cuts in the Strategic Defense Initiative and the B-2 stealth bomber
on the agenda.
   Throwing a wrench in plans to cut Bush's request for $307
billion in defense spending for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 is
the White House estimate that it will cost $1 billion a month to
foot the bill for Operation Desert Shield.
   Lawmakers said the U.S. presence would likely last at least two
or three months, and Rep. Sonny Montgomery, D-Miss., told reporters
that ``even if we get Hussein to settle down ... we might have to
keep some multinational force over there.''
   Asked how the United States could pay for U.S. forces,
Montgomery, a member of the House Armed Services Committee,
suggested reducing the planned purchase of some weapons while
eliminating others.
   In its version of the defense bill, the House Armed Services
Committee halted production of the B-2 bomber at the 15 currently
in production. At nearly $865 million each, it is the costliest
airplane ever built.
   The panel also stripped nearly $2 billion from Bush's request of
$4.7 billion for SDI, popularly known as Star Wars.
   In a report on the trip, House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt,
D-Mo., said additional money must be provided in this fiscal year
as well as the next to support the U.S. military presence in the
Persian Gulf.

<HEAD>Federal Government Announces $66 Million New Bedford Harbor
Cleanup</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A New York company has agreed to pay $66 million
toward cleaning up New Bedford Harbor, where industrial pollution
has forced closing of lobster and fishing grounds, the federal
government announced Tuesday.
   Officials said the payment _ part of a settlement between the
government and AVX Corp. of New York City _ is one of the largest
such payments in the history of the Superfund. The decade-old fund
was set up to attack the nation's worst cases of hazardous waste
pollution.
   AVX was one of five companies accused in a federal complaint
filed in 1983 of contributing to the pollution of New Bedford
Harbor by releasing PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, from
manufacturing plants near the harbor. PCBs have been found to cause
cancer, and their use has been restricted.
   A call to AVX headquarters for comment Tuesday evening rang
unanswered.
   The complaint alleged that the PCBs damaged the harbor's natural
resources, including 18,000 acres of beaches, fishing and
lobstering grounds.
   Part of the $66 million settlement will reimburse the government
for money it has already spent at New Bedford, home to one of the
nation's biggest commercial fishin fleets.
   ``Settlements such as this are the backbone of the Superfund
program,'' said U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator
William Reilly in a news release. ``EPA is committed to an
aggressive policy of making those who pollute pay for the cleanup.
We will continue to use every enforcement mechanism available to
bring about more settlements and more private party cleanups.''
   The money is to be paid to the EPA, the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration and the state.
   From 1947 through 1973, AVX owned and operated what is now known
as the Aerovox plant. AVX recently merged with a Japanese firm, EPA
spokesman Jim Sebastian said Tuesday.
   Studies by the Environmental Protection Agency in the 1970s
revealed high levels of PCBs in fish and shellfish in New Bedford
Harbor. As a result, officials closed a 10-square-mile area of the
harbor to lobstering and closed a smaller area to fishing for
bottom-feeding species. They remain closed.
   The government has reached an agreement in principle with two
other companies named in the original complaints, Aerovox Inc., of
New Bedford, and Belleville Industries Inc., a dissolved company,
officials said. The terms of the settlement are to be presented in
federal district court this fall.
   A trial date of March 4, 1991, has been set for the two other
companies named in the complaint, Federal Pacific Electric Co., of
Delaware, and Cornell-Dubilier Electronics Inc., of New Bedford.
   New Bedford Harbor is an urban tidal estuary at the head of
Buzzards Bay, 50 miles southeast of Boston.

<TEXT>
   American Indian leaders urged Congress on
Tuesday to approve a memorial to the warriors who fell at Little
Big Horn while Virginia officials urged a national commission to
help preserve Civil War battlefields.
   ``We need to honor our warriors who gave their lives,'' Carol
Gipp of the National Congress of American Indians told the House
Interior Committee's subcommittee on national parks and public
lands.
   The appeal came as Indians, conservationists and others crowded
the hearing room to plead for approval of favorite bills before
Congress adjourns next month.
   A memorial to the warriors who fell in the 1876 victory of the
Sioux over Lt. Col. George Custer and a detachment of the 7th
Cavalry Regiment would cost about $2.1 million, the National Park
Service has estimated. The service is supporting the memorial, as
yet undesigned.
   The memorial would be adjacent to the monument to the 7th
Cavalry which was erected on Last Stand Hill on the Montana
battlefield in 1881. It bears the full names of Custer and each of
the 224 other men in his command.
   Custer was a temporary general with the Union Army during the
Civil War but reverted to lieutenant colonel afterward, the rank he
held in 1876.
   Susan Shown-Harjo, president of the Morning Star Foundation
representing the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes, said the names of the
cavalry troopers on the monument has given them ``dignity in
death.''
   ``Our people who died there are referred to as hordes of Indians
along with the cavalry who are named,'' she said.
   The number of Indian dead is unknown, but the National Park
Service says no more than 100 are believed to have been killed in
the battle.
   Virginia officials and historic preservationists urged approval
of a national commission on civil war battlefields to help shield a
number of sites from development as the suburbs outside the
nation's capital spread southward.
   Mayor Elizabeth G. Helm of Winchester pointed to estimates that
employment in the Dulles Corridor outside Washington would grow
more than 1,000 percent and the homes of those joining the labor
force most likely would be in central Maryland and the northern
Shenandoah Valley.
   ``This same area is heavily steeped in history and tradition but
we have tended to take this heritage for granted,'' she said. ``We
have assumed that it will always be with us for future
generations.''
   ``Our ancestors provided beautifully for large and splendid
Confederate and national cemeteries but no one anticipated the
growth that has obliterated many of the battlefields,'' she added.
   Also urging action were Reps. Jim Olin, D-Va., and D. French
Slaughter Jr., R-Va., as well as historic preservationists who are
urging quick action by the government before suburban sprawl
gobbles up battlefields.
   Dr. James Gardner, deputy director of the American Historical
Association, however, opposed the plan. If approved, he said,
``greater and greater amounts of money will be pushed into this
aspect of our history to the exclusion of others.''
   He said preservationists ``should not be so preoccupied with
Civil War battlefields.''
   ``We need to pull back from this Civil War focus and take a
broader view of American history,'' he said.

<HEAD>More Bittersweet Homecomings for Americans From Kuwait</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A new wave of Americans has begun returning home after fleeing
Kuwait, and as with previous hostages, their joy is tempered by the
knowledge that others remain behind.
   ``It feels great,'' Rhonda Kilgore said Monday after she and her
three young children arrived at her mother's home in Raytown, Mo.,
a suburb of Kansas City.
   Yet Ms. Kilgore _ who asked to be identified by her maiden name
only _ said she worries about her husband, who had to stay behind.
   Ms. Kilgore, five months pregnant and suffering from anemia, was
among 46 Americans with medical problems who were allowed to fly
back to the United States with the Rev. Jesse Jackson on Sunday.
   ``We have to thank Jesse Jackson for all of it,'' she said. ``If
it wasn't for him negotiating with Saddam Hussein, I don't think
any of us would have gotten out of there.''
   She said she hopes her husband, who is Jordanian, will be able
to escape through Jordan and join the family in the United States.
   Sandi Abdilkareem is another American who married a Jordanian.
And while she and her four children arrived to a joyous greeting by
relatives in Seattle on Monday night, her husband, David
Abdilkareem, remains in the Middle East.
   The Abdilkareems drove 500 miles across Iraq to escape Kuwait,
Mrs. Abdilkareem said. She said her husband chose to stay behind.
   ``He wanted to stay,'' said Mrs. Abdilkareem, who moved to
Kuwait about 12 years ago with her husband. ``Everything we worked
for is back there. If everything calms down, I hope one day to go
back.''
   Mrs. Abdilkareem, whose father, Gary Marquardt, lives in Gig
Harbor, Wash., said she decided to return to the U.S. five days
ago, when Hussein promised that American women and children would
be allowed to leave.
   ``We said we'd better take the chance, before something else
happens. The next morning, we were ready to go,'' she said.
   The family drove from their home in Ahmidie, Kuwait, to Baghdad.
   Although they were stopped and checked several times by Iraqi
officials, they were allowed to go on to Baghdad, where they stayed
four days before boarding a plane, Mrs. Abdilkareem said.
   ``Me and my husband drove with no problem,'' she said.
   Mrs. Abdilkareem credited Jackson with getting her plane off the
ground on Sunday. The flight was canceled at the last minute, but
she said Jackson persuaded Iraqi authorities to allow it to leave.
   Ms. Kilgore was able to leave directly from Kuwait, although she
said there were some tense moments before her departure.
   It was last Friday, she said, when word came from the U.S.
Embassy to get to the airport in 10 minutes. On the way there, a
soldier stopped the car and asked where they were going. Her
husband said they were bound for the airport, and when the soldier
asked his wife's nationality, he replied she was American.
   ``He just kind of hesitated like he didn't know what to do,''
Ms. Kilgore said. ``Three seconds just seemed like a lifetime,
waiting for his decision.''
   The soldier waved them on, but the ordeal was far from over.
There were no American Embassy officials at the airport, and when
one of the other Americans called to check, they found out that
Jackson was still negotiating with Saddam Hussein for the release.
   They were told to be patient, but it meant a wait of more than
eight hours.
   ``The airport was full of Iraqis,'' she said. ``I was scared to
death. We thought maybe if the negotiation doesn't go through all
of these Iraqis have us.''

<TEXT>
   A prominent columnist for a leftist
weekly who wrote critically about Islam was shot to death Tuesday,
police said.
   Turan Dursun, 56, who wrote for the popular publication Yuzyil,
was slain shortly after he left his house, said Istanbul police
chief Hamdi Ardali.
   Ardali said there were no witnesses. No details were immediately
known, nor were there any claims of responsibility.
   However, Dursun's colleagues at the magazine said he had been
receiving death threats because of his columns, which criticized
Islam.
   His column titled ``Religion Education'' harshly criticized
Islam and its holy book, the Koran. Dursun was a mufti, an
interpreter of Islam, by education and he was also the author of a
book titled ``This is Religion.''
   Dursun's killing was similar to the death of Istanbul daily
Hurriyet's columnist Cetin Emec in March. Emec was killed by gunmen
in front of his house. A group calling itself the Union of Turkish
Islamic Commandos claimed responsibility.
   Kemal Ataturk, founder of modern Turkey, established a secular
state in place of Islamic law more than six decades ago in this
predominantly Moslem country. Many Turks have been increasingly
concerned by the recent spread of Islamic fundamentalism.
   Before Yuzyil started publishing five weeks ago, Dursun was
writing for 2000'e Dogru.
   Yuzyil inherited the staff and columnists of 2000'e Dogru, which
was shut down by the government for its detailed coverage of
Kurdish unrest in southeastern Turkey in June.

   Most University of Florida students
returned to their classes Tuesday after a week of mourning for five
slain college students. But some have begun adding an off-campus
gun course to their academic load.
   Investigators revisited the scenes of the five killings with a
new laser device to search for additional evidence.
   As fearful and apprehensive students returned from the Labor Day
weekend, police warned that the killer may still be in their midst.
   ``We do not have a timetable on an arrest, warrants or fruition
of this case,'' said Lt. Spencer Mann, an Alachua County Sheriff's
Office spokesman.
   Larry Humes, a University of Florida spokesman, said although
exact figures were not available ``our feeling is the majority of
the students are back.''
   Many are frightened, however. Since the killings, about 60
people have signed up for a gun-safety course offered by Beckwith
Indoor Pistol Range. That compares to three-four students a week
normally taking the $35 class.
   ``It's been crazy,'' instructor Joe Parker said Tuesday.
   The three-hour course teaches how to shoot in self-defense.
   ``Safety is heavily stressed,'' Parker said. ``We don't want
them hurting themselves or another innocent person.''
   Firearms are not allowed on the University of Florida campus.
   The university doesn't offer any martial-art self-defense
classes but is considering them, said Martha Varnes, a spokeswoman
with the University of Florida Police Department.
   The bodies of University of Florida freshmen Sonja Larson, 18,
and Christina Powell, 17, were found Aug. 26. The body of Santa Fe
Community College student Christa Hoyt was found the next day,
while the bodies of Tracey Paules, 23, and Manuel Taboada, 23, were
found Aug. 28.
   On Tuesday, investigators returned to the three murder sites
with a laser device invented by a Hattiesburg, Miss., dentist, Dr.
Michael West.
   Lt. Sadie Darnell, a Gainesville police spokeswoman, said the
laser may be able ``to pick up information not apparent to the
naked eye.'' But police refused to say exactly what the device does.
   Ms. Darnell said investigators will take any help offered _ even
information from psychics and people who have reported dreams.
   Of 20 binders full of initial investigative reports, 11
represent such information and do not require follow-ups, she said.
Only four or five notebooks contain investigative leads of the
highest priority.
   The three chief investigators of the slayings told The
Gainesville Sun that they believe the killer left behind a message
at three crime scenes last week.
   ``In the scene, the setup, there was a message _ to authorities,
to law enforcement, to whoever,'' said Capt. R. B. Ward of the
Gainesville Police Department, and one of the men in charge of the
murder investigation.
   ``We have come to the conclusion he was very calculated, very
methodical in the way the person did things _ as well as left
things,'' Ward said.
   Police have said they have eight suspects in the case.
   On Tuesday, Gainesville police said Stephen Michael Bates, a
Lakeland short-order cook, is one the top suspects. He has been
held in the Polk County Jail on $100,500 bond since his Aug. 29
arrest in an unrelated assault case.
   Polk County authorities have said they doubt Bates, 30, is the
killer but his fingerprints have been sent to the task force
investigating the slayings.
   Also Tuesday, new charges were filed against another of the
``primary suspects,'' Edward Humphrey, in an unrelated case in
another jurisdiction.
   The Indian River County Sheriff's Office announced it had issued
warrants for Humphrey in the armed burglary and attempted sexual
battery of a woman two years ago. In a statement, sheriff's
spokeswoman Theresa Woodson said the victim saw a newspaper
photograph of Humphrey over the weekend and identified him as her
attacker.
   Humphrey, 18, a university freshman, remained jailed jailed in
an unrelated beating in another city.
   He, was being held in the Brevard County Jail in Sharpes on $1
million bond for allegedly assaulting his grandmother. Public
Defender J.R. Russo planned to ask a judge Thursday to reduce the
bond.
   Asked why he believed his client had not been arrested in
connection with the Gainesville case, Russo said ``it would seem to
me you would need some amount of probable cause.''
   The task force has taken Humphrey's fingerprints and footprints,
samples of his blood and his psychiatric records. His Gainesville
apartment remained sealed under police guard Tuesday as a search
continued on the grounds around it. Police will not say when or if
they will seek a search warrant for the apartment.
   Humphrey lived briefly this summer at an apartment complex where
Taboada and Miss Paules were killed and at a dormitory where Miss
Powell lived.

   Widows, orphans and disabled people
from Nicaragua's civil war occupying the state-run TV station
rejected a government offer Tuesday to negotiate pension demands if
they first left the building.
   The station returned to the air Tuesday afternoon although the
dispute continued.
   ``Not one step back!'' chanted about 200 people in front of the
National Television System master controls building when they heard
the government offer.
   The slogan, a standby of the leftist Sandinistas, pointed up the
tension between the conservative government of President Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro and the Sandinistas. The confrontation raised
the possibility of a public sector strike similar to those that
crippled the nation in May and July.
   About 70 people _ survivors and war wounded, including those in
wheelchairs _ invaded the TV station Monday evening, broadcast a
short message before the transmission signal was cut off, and
locked themselves inside the building.
   By Tuesday, someone had placed a small red-and-black Sandinista
flag on the roof.
   Fernando Lopez, national coordinator of the Organization of
Handicapped Revolutionaries, led the takeover.
   ``During the 10{ years of Sandinista government, our pensions
were re-evaluated 35 times, and during the last four months of this
government the pensions have been devaluated 35 times,'' he said.
   Lopez sat in his wheelchair Tuesday under a banyan tree across
the street from the TV building, chatting with reporters.
   The station returned to the air by transmitting directly from
its downtwon studios to transmission facilities, bypassing a master
control unit occupied by the protesters.
   ``While the negotiations between the government and the wounded
continue, enjoy our programming,'' the station's press chief Luis
Mora told viewers.
   However, a civil war veteran in the master control unit told The
Associated Press that negotiations had not yet begun.
   Police had cordoned off the area but were mostly gone Tuesday.
They confiscated three pistols.
   The Sandinistas, defeated in Feb. 25 elections by Mrs. Chamorro
coalition, had governed since overthrowing the Somoza family
dictatorship in 1979. The Sandinistas later fought a nine-year
civil war with U.S.-backed Contra rebels in which 30,000 people
were killed.
   Lopez said the Chamorro government offered pension increases
ranging from $3.35 to $22 a month. But weekly devaluations quickly
erode pay increases.
   ``I told them it was a mockery to us,'' Lopez said. ``They said
they would get back to us, and nothing happened. That's why we took
this over.''
   He said his group wants at least $66 a month in gold cordobas, a
new currency that trades officially on par with the dollar and is
supposed to be devaluation-proof.
   Bank workers were negotiating salary raises with administrators
Tuesday after threatening a strike.
   Alberto Mercado, coordinator of the National Federation of
Communications Media, told The Associated Press that TV workers had
not joined the takeover, but supported the action.
   Mercado said the Sandinista Workers Syndicate will meet Sunday
to discuss whether Sandinista labor groups would join talks the
government has proposed.
   Protesters grew even more bitter Tuesday when they learned that
demobilized Contras received $50 on Monday to help them start anew
as civilians. It was part of an aid package to Nicaragua approved
by the U.S. Congress this year.
   Labor unrest by Sandinista unions has plagued the Chamorro
government since its inauguration April 25.
   Mrs. Chamorro's wants to decentralize the economy, stop large
state subsidies, and trim public payrolls to control inflation and
increase production. But those measures have meant increased
unemployment, lower salaries and higher prices for food and basic
services.
   Many families have had to cut back on rice and beans, the basic
Nicaraguan diet.

   The most influential of the five lawmakers
accused in a bribery sting pleaded guilty Tuesday and agreed to
cooperate with federal prosecutors.
   Robert Brown, 34, a Democrat and former chairman of the House
Labor, Commerce and Industry Committee, admitted accepting $2,500
in bribes from a lobbyist _ working for the FBI _ in exchange for
supporting a bill to allow pari-mutuel betting on dog and horse
racing in the state. If approved, the bill would have put the
gambling issue on the November ballot.
   The 7-year lawmaker resigned his seat Aug. 23, the day before he
was indicted under the federal Hobbs Act, which forbids lawmakers
from accepting money or gifts in exchange for votes or favors.
   Brown pleaded guilty to one corruption count in U.S. District
Court before Judge Falcon B. Hawkins.
   After his hearing, prosecutors released a grainy black-and-white
videotape showing the FBI sting operation that led to the
indictments of Brown and four other state lawmakers.
   The videotape showed an April meeting at which Brown accepted
$2,000 from Ron Cobb, a lobbyist who was recruited by the FBI. The
money was exchanged on a yacht at Hilton Head Island.
   FBI special agent Michael Clemens testified that Brown later
accepted $500 from Cobb here.
   Clemons testified that Cobb first approached Brown in January.
The agent quoted Brown as saying he wanted money in exchange for
his support, telling Cobb: ```I think you know where my motivation
is.'''
   When Cobb asked Brown to name an amount, Brown said he wanted
``the biggest number you can get,'' Clemens testified.
   In late July, shortly after news of the investigation broke,
Brown filed an amended campaign report disclosing that he had
received $2,500 cash from Cobb. He denied then that the money was a
bribe.
   U.S. Attorney Bart Daniel said he would recommend a sentence of
about 3 years in exchange for Brown's cooperation, which is to
include testimony against his colleagues if necessary. The maximun
penalty is 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   A sentencing date has yet to be set.
   Brown, who is free on bond, declined to comment after the
hearing.
   Rick Lee, a Republican who resigned his Senate seat last week,
is scheduled to appear before a federal judge on Monday. Lee has
said he intends to plead guilty to accepting a $2,000 bribe from
Cobb.
   State Reps. Robert Kohn, Luther Taylor and Danny Winstead all
face similar charges. Winstead also was charged with obstruction of
justice.
   Kohn, a Republican who has said he won't seek re-election, and
Taylor, a Democrat, were suspended from the House pending
resolution of the charges. Winstead, a Republican, resigned his
seat last month.
   The indictments capped a 16-month FBI investigation in alleged
corruption in the state Legislature.
   The gambling bill was approved by Brown's committee last year,
but never came up for a full House vote. The full Senate also
failed to vote on a similar bill.

   Iraq raised hopes Tuesday for speeding up
the evacuation of stranded Western women and children by allowing
two charter flights to leave Baghdad and a bus convoy to take
Britons out of Kuwait.
   Two Iraqi Airways Boeing 727s chartered by West Germany and the
United States flew nearly 300 foreigners, mostly women and
children, to Amman, Jordan on Tuesday.
   Western diplomats said a third jetliner, chartered by France,
would leave Baghdad for the Jordanian capital on Wednesday.
   The Canadian Charge d'Affaires Dale Carl said Canada had
chartered an Iraqi Airways Boeing 707 to fly 175 Westerners _ all
but 30 of them Canadians _ from Kuwait City to Baghdad and then on
Thursday to Ankara, Turkey. He said Iraq had promised to issue exit
visas at the Baghdad airport.
   The United States hoped to arrange its own charter to carry
Americans out of Kuwait within days.
   Iraq President Saddam Hussein said last week he would allow
Western women and children to leave, but not the men. More than 700
Western detainees _ women, children and a few ill men _ left aboard
two Iraqi Airways flights on Saturday. Some also have traveled
across the desert to Jordan.
   But the departures of others have been complicated by Iraq's
refusal to allow foreign airlines to land in Baghdad and by long
delays in processing exit permits. About 11,000 Westerners are now
believed stranded in Kuwait and Iraq.
   The American charter on Tuesday carried at least 138 passengers,
including 25 Americans, 44 French and 36 British nationals, as well
as four Australians and two Canadians.
   Its departure from Baghdad was delayed for 4{ hours because of
technical problems with the aircraft, Iraqi authorities said. A
second plane had to be substituted.
   ``I have to assume there were technical problems and assume
there was no ill will,'' said one Western diplomat.
   The West German charter included 135 West German nationals among
its passengers.
   Also Tuesday, a convoy carrying 306 British women and children
in seven buses and one car left Kuwait in the morning to make the
grueling drive across the desert to Baghdad, a British diplomat
said.
   ``We are pretty sure that they're on their way out,'' said the
diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``When they arrive we
will start processing their exit visas, their travel documents.''
   British diplomats said they hoped to arrange a charter flight
direct to London, or failing that to Amman, for the Britons in the
convoy.
   ``We just want to get them out,'' said the diplomat. ``If there
is no charter then we will send them out in batches on regularly
scheduled commercial flights to Amman. As a last resort we will
move them out by convoy to Jordan.''
   The BBC World Service began carrying announcements late Monday
advising British women and children about the bus convoy. The
embassy also used a system of volunteer wardens to get the word out
to Britons in hiding.
   The women and children were told to gather at a shopping center
parking lot, and to bring plenty of water along for the 400-mile
drive up the Tigris River basin to Baghdad.
   Western diplomats in Baghdad described the situation in occupied
Kuwait as grim since the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion and have been
pushing to speed the evacuation of women and children.
   They are not sure how much longer their countries' diplomats in
Kuwait can hold on to assist people in leaving. Diplomats who have
rejected Iraqi demands to move to Baghdad are stranded in their
embassies with the power and water cut off and food supplies
diminishing.
   A Norwegian diplomat in Iraq said the Norwegian Foreign Ministry
has instructed Ambassador Hans Wilhelm Longva and the two remaining
staff members to leave the embassy in Kuwait City on Thursday and
travel to Baghdad.
   On Monday, Western diplomats said Iraq had complicated
evacuation plans by rescinding landing rights in Baghdad for
foreign jetliners. The Iraqis linked their decision to the denial
of landing rights abroad to Iraqi planes under the U.N. trade
embargo. Baghdad said evacuees must be flown out on chartered Iraqi
Airways planes.
   The Canadian charter would be the first full flight of evacuees
from Kuwait City to Baghdad. On Saturday, the Rev. Jesse Jackson
arranged to fly about 30 Americans out of Kuwait to connect with a
special evacuation flight in Baghdad.
   More than 2,000 Americans, including an estimated 1,400 women
and children, are unaccounted for in Kuwait and thought to be in
hiding.
   Iraq has said that Western men cannot leave as long as a threat
is posed by the massive U.S.-led military buildup across the border
in Saudi Arabia.
   Naji al-Hadithi, director-general of the Iraqi information
ministry, said ``thousands of foreign guests'' have been relocated
at potential military targets ``to make the Americans think twice
about attacking.''
   Iraq has warned it will hang any Kuwaitis caught harboring
Westerners.
   But a diplomatic source said Tuesday that the Kuwaiti resistance
has countered the Iraqi threat by warning it will kill anyone who
turns in people harboring Westerners.

   The savings and loan crisis has been in the
headlines for several years now, but for most Americans, it has
amounted to a troubling, but distant, scandal. Recently, more and
more people are feeling the effects as the fallout trickles down to
Main Street. This first of a three-part series, ``S&amp;Ls on Main
Street,'' examines how the mess is taking its toll across the
country on once-unlikely targets.

   Jean Shoults was careful to pick a
stable neighborhood with solid home values when she moved her
family here two years ago. But a single government decision may
cost her $25,000 in home equity.
   ``You think you're buying the American dream and it turns into a
nightmare,'' Mrs. Shoults said. ``We are savings and loan victims.''
   She's not alone. Across the country, more and more people are
finding they, too, are S&amp;L victims. Small businesses can't find
loans. Subcontractors get stiffed on payments. Real estate markets
are in ruins, neighborhoods tied up in government red tape. Home
buyers like Judy and Dave Crenshaw in Colorado Springs, Colo.,
battle through three mortgage companies, and lose out on one home,
before finally getting a deal approved.
   You wouldn't expect a small Phoenix gold and jewelry store to be
affected by the S&amp;L debacle, or a small advertising agency to end
up a victim.
   But the S&amp;L mess has forced its way onto Main Street. It has
eliminated jobs, crushed real estate values and weakened an already
weak economy by crimping lending.
   All this before the tax bite, estimated at about $20 per family
each month over the next 30 years.
   ``It's catching up to us quickly,'' said David Wyss, chief
financial economist at DRI-McGraw Hill. ``People are beginning to
see more and more that we're all victims.''
   For years, the crisis had little impact for millions of
Americans because federal deposit insurance protected their
accounts at savings banks, shielding Main Street from the $500
billion fiasco.
   Now, however, changes made by Congress and regulators, along
with the restructuring of the industry, are affecting the economy,
contributing to the nation's ``credit crunch'' and possibly helping
push a sluggish U.S. economy closer to recession, economists say.
   The construction industry, which is struggling nationwide, is
particularly hard-hit by problems associated with S&amp;Ls, which
traditionally have been the chief source of financing for home
building.
   Demand is down, but changes ordered by regulators also have
helped curb building loans, and analysts say banks and S&amp;Ls are
reluctant to make any real estate loan that might be labeled risky
by regulators.
   ``Builders live on credit,'' said Dean Crist, research economist
for the National Association of Home Builders. ``So what this has
done is cut them off completely.''
   That sets off a chain reaction that ends on Main Street.
   Home buyers say they've had a tough time finding financing, and
sellers have been battered by the lack of buyers. The huge amount
of empty real estate has depressed prices.
   Spring Valley Construction found itself an inadvertent victim of
the S&amp;L mess. The company built much of Stonebridge Ranch, a giant
S&amp;L-financed development north of Dallas. When the S&amp;L went bust,
Spring Valley still was owed several hundred thousand dollars for
work it already had done.
   ``We don't get paid, so our subcontractors don't get paid. It
ends up with the guy that works for a living,'' Jim Duffy,
Stonebridge's vice president of operations.
   The S&amp;L crisis is impacting Main Street in many other ways:

<TEXT>
   Joan Leff gets teary thinking about her future. She, too, is a
victim _ but she's more a victim of the risk-taking of high-flying
S&amp;L executives unleashed by the deregulation of the industry.
   Ms. Leff, an office manager at a California retirement home,
took all the money she had _ $90,000 from a divorce settlement _ to
a local savings bank, Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, to buy a certificate
of deposit that would give her monthly interest to help pay her
rent.
   Instead, a salesman talked her into a bond that paid slightly
higher interest. Ms. Leff thought the bond was safe and insured,
just like a CD.
   It wasn't.
   The bond turned out to be a junk bond in Lincoln's parent
company, American Continental Corp. American Continental defaulted
on the bonds, which have been basically worthless since April 1989.
Some 22,000 investors, most in California, bought $250 million
worth of them. Investors in Illinois and other states have similar
complaints about other S&amp;Ls.
   Unable to pay her rent, Ms. Leff moved into a cheap one-bedroom
apartment, where she still lives.
   ``The loss was almost worse than the loss of my marriage,'' she
said.
   Bondholders and the state of California have sued American
Continental and its former chairman, Charles Keating, claiming
fraud in the bond sales. American Continental and Keating have
denied any wrongdoing.
   But Ms. Leff finds little comfort in any lawsuit.
   ``It's not like I invested in penny stocks or pork bellies or
even the stock market,'' said Ms. Leff, the office manager at a
retirement home.
   ``I thought a bank would be safe.''

   Gary Homsey didn't get in a financial bind because of S&amp;L
borrowing, or even S&amp;L accounts. He runs his own advertising agency
in Dallas that specializes in financial institutions, and the S&amp;L
crisis has made for some tough times.
   His biggest client, Murray Savings, spent $1 million a year on
advertising. But Murray went bust, and was taken over this year by
another S&amp;L, which had its own advertising agency. And as the
number of banks and S&amp;Ls shrinks nationwide, finding new clients is
a daunting task.
   ``Anytime you lose a big account, it's tough,'' Homsey said.
``Consolidation in the S&amp;Ls has made it very difficult for a lot of
small businesses.''

   Michael Kay seemed even farther removed from the thrift debacle.
He sells jewelry at a strip shopping center in north Phoenix, and
until recently, business was good.
   But Kay had to pack up the gold and jewelry store and move it a
mile down the street, which cost his business $50,000.
   His shopping center fell into the hands of government regulators
and lost most of its tenants. No tenants, no traffic.
   Other Phoenix stores in the chain were growing, but Kay saw
business decline.
   ``The trickle-down process is severe (in the S&amp;L crisis),'' said
Kay, who had been at the Bell Tower Village four years. ``These
kind of centers are just neglected.''
   Bell Tower Village is slated to be auctioned off by the
government this fall.

   Jean Shoults, the Arlington, Texas, woman in danger of taking a
$25,000 hit on her home equity, believes her neighborhood is
beginning to feel the crisis in an even newer way _ fallout from
government decisions.
   The fashionable, wooded area, Parker Oaks, has gone to court
trying to block the Resolution Trust Corp., the government agency
charged with disposing of S&amp;L properties, from selling the
remaining 108 lots to a tract-home developer.
   The builder, Centex Corp., has proposed building Fox &amp; Jacobs
brand homes for $48 to $60 a square foot, Parker Oaks residents
say. Most of the homes in the neighborhood are worth at least $70 a
square foot, even at today's depressed prices, and deed
restrictions on the land were designed to ensure continuity
throughout the neighborhood.
   Putting cheaper tract homes next to larger custom homes would
depress the value of the larger homes, as well as violate deed
restrictions the Parker Oaks homeowners thought protected them,
residents contend.
   The neighborhood has asked a federal court to block the sale.
RTC officials declined comment because of the pending court case,
but Fox &amp; Jacobs President Richard Sconyers said his company's plan
meets the deed restrictions and ``is fully compatible with what's
out there.''
   Residents disagree, and they've added a new decorative accent to
their well-to-do neighborhood: huge protest signs and banners
attacking the RTC.
   ``It ruins us as far as housing value goes,'' said Mrs. Shoults.
``The biggest investment you make is in a house. This represents
just about everything we've got.''

   Lt. Gov. Martha Griffiths, who was dumped
from the election ticket amid hints that at 78 she was too old for
a third term, said Tuesday she supports the governor anyway.
   ``Yes, I'll vote for the governor. I support the governor. I
support the Democratic Party,'' Griffiths said, promising she won't
fight Gov. James Blanchard at next week's state Democratic
convention.
   ``The governor has spoken and I will object to a floor fight,''
she said. Blanchard dropped the lieutenant governor as his running
mate Aug. 24, saying the No. 2 slot should be filled by someone who
could ``take over the heavy responsibilities of being governor.''
He refused to elaborate, and has yet to name a replacement.
   Griffiths, who originally was furious, said Tuesday that she and
Blanchard have ``kissed and made up.'' But her husband, Hicks
Griffiths, said he might support the Republican candidate.
   That delighted supporters of Republican candidate John Engler,
who last week chose a 66-year-old former Mother of the Year and
state senator as his running mate.
   The GOP candidated for lieutenant governor is Sen. Connie
Binsfeld, who has been in politics since 1975. She was honored by
the Michigan Mothers Association in 1977 as Mother of the Year.
   Engler insisted his decision had nothing to do with the
Blanchard-Griffiths furor. But in announcing her selection, he
stressed that Binsfeld is qualified to take over as governor if
something should happen to him.
   Griffiths on Tuesday raised the issue of sex and discrimination,
noting that nobody objected to the re-election campaign of her
fellow Democrat, Secretary of State Richard Austin, age 77.
   The lieutenant governor briefly described a meeting she had with
Blanchard last week to explain a published report of her apparent
reference to him as a ``son of a bitch.''
   She said she told the governor she meant the reference to
politicians in general, rather than to him specifically. However,
she dodged a question about whether Blanchard falls into the same
category as those other politicians.
   ``You be the judge,'' she responded.

   Gov. Buddy Roemer and his estranged
wife, Patti, were granted a divorce Tuesday.
   Roemer, 46, and his former wife, 36, separated a year ago.
   The Mrs. Roemer was in court with her lawyer, Lewis Unglesby,
when Family Court Judge Anthony Graphia issued the divorce
judgment. The governor didn't appear.
   The decree granted the divorce under terms of a ``private
contract signed between the parties on April 6, 1990.''
   The Roemers were married in 1973 and have a 10-year-old son,
Dakota. Gov. Roemer has an older son and daughter by a previous
marriage.
   In a joint statement issued by the governor's press office, the
couple said:
   ``After a year of separation, we are deeply saddened that our
marriage cannot work, but sometimes bad things happen to good
people. Although our marriage of 16 years has ended, we remain
friends, viewing each other with respect, love and honor.

   The federal ``payola'' case against record
promoter Joseph Isgro was thrown out of court Tuesday by a judge
who accused proscutors of ``outrageous government misconduct'' in
withholding testimony.
   U.S. District Judge James Ideman said prosecutors deliberately
withheld from the defense contradictory statements by a key witness
against Isgro.
   The independent promoter was hired by record companies to
persuade radio stations to play their songs. Prosecutors allege
that Isgro gave payola of cash and cocaine to employees of stations
in Texas and California in return for playing certain songs.
   The decision also threw out the case against Isgro's two
co-defendants, convicted cocaine dealer Jeffrey Monka and former
Columbia Records executive Raymond Anderson.
   Isgro was being tried on 57 counts of racketeering, failing to
report the payments to the Internal Revenue Service and other
charges.
   His trial had been called the radio and record industry's
biggest payola case in 30 years. It featured testimony about
cocaine and cash stuffed into album jackets and audio cassette
cases delivered to radio station executives.
   Under a 1960 federal law, failing to disclose paying or
receiving ``payola'' on income tax returns is illegal, but the
actual payment is not a violation.
   The key witness whose statements were at issue in the dismissal
motion was Dennis Di Ricco, a former Internal Revenue Service agent
convicted of tax conspiracy and obstruction of justice in San
Francisco in 1989.
   Isgro's lawyers discovered last week that Di Ricco testified in
his own behalf in that trial. They got a transcript of the
testimony and found that it contradicted what he told a grand jury
that indicted Isgro.
   In the San Francisco case, Di Ricco denied any involvement in
payola activities with Isgro. In his testimony against Isgro before
a Los Angeles grand jury Di Ricco claimed involvement.
   Ideman declared a mistrial and ordered the indictment dismissed.
   ``The court finds there has been outrageous government
misconduct in this case,'' the judge said.
   Friends of Isgro cheered and congratulated him in the courtroom.
He had few words outside court. He said he was ``relieved and
happy.''
   ``Everything the judge said was absolutely true,'' said defense
attorney Don Re. ``The government was willing to win at all costs
and it got its hand caught in the cookie jar.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney William Lynch said, ``It's regrettable
the judge made that decision. We believe he is wrong and we will
appeal.''
   Ideman ruled last week that Justice Department prosecutors
improperly withheld from the defense Di Ricco's prior testimony.
   Ideman said then that prosecutors violated a long-established
rule requiring disclosure before trial of any witness statements
that would tend to help a defendant prove his innocence.
   Prosecutors admitted in a written brief that they didn't give
the defense a transcript of Di Ricco's prior testimony. But they
denied that they intended to hide anything.
   Di Ricco wasn't sent to prison on his conviction because he
agreed to cooperate at Isgro's trial.

   NASA enjoyed a calm, uneventful
countdown Tuesday as the space agency moved closer to its third
attempt to send Columbia on an astronomy mission and its first
shuttle flight in months.
   Columbia is scheduled to lift off at 1:20 a.m. Thursday with
seven astronauts and the $150 million Astro observatory.
   ``Everybody's very comfortable. The firing room is very calm,''
said test director Al Sofge. ``We're just proceeding down through
the count, business as usual, doing what we do best, no problems.''
   NASA's first attempt to launch Columbia with Astro ended six
hours before the scheduled May 30 liftoff when hydrogen leaked
during fueling. The next countdown was halted Thursday after
engineers lost contact with one of four telescopes inside
Columbia's cargo bay.
   The communications problem with the X-ray telescope was
corrected Sunday, allowing NASA to begin counting down once again.
   ``We've had our share of problems. I figure it's time to have
something go right for Astro,'' said project manager Bill
Huddleston.
   The latest delay required a slight juggling of Astro's observing
schedule, said Arthur Davidsen, principal investigator of Johns
Hopkins University's ultraviolet telescope.
   Astronomers now will be able to observe Jupiter, which was too
close to the sun as of last week, Davidsen said. But an important
quasar _ the brightest one, in fact _ has moved too close to the
sun and will not be visible to Astro until late fall.
   ``We don't want to delay that long,'' Davidsen said.
   Scientists have been waiting for years for NASA to send up the
observatory, which will study ultraviolet light and X-rays emitted
from some of the hottest objects in the universe. About 150 objects
will be observed during the nine- to 10-day flight, including a
comet that is making its first recorded pass through the solar
system.
   Astro had been scheduled for a ride on Columbia in March 1986,
but the Challenger disaster two months earlier put all missions on
hold.
   Astro's three ultraviolet telescopes will be operated
round-the-clock by the four astronomers aboard Columbia. The X-ray
telescope will be managed by computer commands sent from Goddard
Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.
   It will be the first scientific mission in five years dedicated
entirely to scientific research. Astro will remain in the cargo bay
and be returned to Earth for possible use on a future mission.
   Columbia will be the first shuttle to fly since the entire fleet
was grounded by hydrogen leaks this summer.
   A month after Columbia's leaks were discovered, Atlantis was
found to have a similar problem and its July flight delayed. NASA
has since replaced Columbia's hydrogen lines and rescheduled
Atlantis' secret military mission for November.
   ``We're looking for a success,'' Huddleston said. ``We have all
expectations that we're going to have a success.''
   NASA last launched a shuttle in April. Discovery's crew
successfully placed the Hubble Space Telescope in orbit, but the
$1.5 billion telescope later was found to have a defective mirror
that produces blurry images.
   NASA is wasting no time getting its shuttle program back on
track. The space agency began moving Discovery out to the other
shuttle launch pad Tuesday night to await an October flight with
the Ulysses satellite. The four-mile trip was expected to take
about six hours, ending early Wednesday.
   It will be only the third time both pads at Kennedy Space Center
have been occupied. The last time was in April, when Columbia was
rolled out for the Astro mission and Discovery was waiting to lift
off with Hubble. The other time was just before the Challenger
accident.
   NASA must launch Discovery between Oct. 5 and Oct. 23 to take
advantage of Earth's alignment with the sun and Jupiter, otherwise
the mission will have to wait 13 months. Ulysses is being sent on a
five-year journey to explore the sun's poles.

   A Navy submarine will investigate and possibly
retrieve what searchers believe is debris from a United Airlines
jet on the ocean floor near here, the military said Tuesday.
   Nine people died when a cargo door and a large chunk of fuselage
tore away from the Boeing 747 shortly after takeoff from Honolulu
International Airport last year.
   In July, an unmanned submersible using sonar located metallic
objects 14,000 down and 90 miles south of Honolulu, including a
large piece roughly the size of the 10-by-10-foot cargo door.
   After reviewing information on the debris field, the National
Transportation Safety Board decided to call for further
investigation, said Lt. Cmdr. Sandy Stairs, a spokeswoman for
Pacific Command, which is responsible for all U.S. forces in the
area.
   The NTSB has said recovering and analyzing the door could lead
to better airline safety rules.
   The search is expected to begin Sept. 15.
   The submarine, named the Sea Cliff, is a 31-foot, 58,000-pound
craft able to operate at depths up to 20,000 feet. It carries a
three-member crew.
   The submarine and its support ship are capable of retrieving
objects from the ocean floor, Stairs said.
   Stairs said searchers will take pictures of the debris and let
authorities decide whether it is worth retrieving.
   The Sea Cliff left San Diego on Tuesday and is expected to
arrive at Pearl Harbor on Sept. 11, Stairs said.
   United Flight 811 carried 355 passengers when it left Honolulu
for New Zealand on Feb. 24, 1989.
   The cargo door opened at 22,000 feet, tearing away a section of
fuselage. Nine people were swept to their deaths and five other
suffered serious injuries. The crew managed to return the jet to
Honolulu.
   The NTSB inquiry determined that faulty design of the locking
mechanism probably caused a cockpit light to falsely indicate the
door was locked.
   The agency blamed United, Boeing Co. and the Federal Aviation
Administration for failing to correct problems with the door.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
Tuesday the Bush administration is giving preliminary thought to
creating a NATO-type organization to deal with future security
threats to the Persian Gulf.
   At the same time, Baker said Iraq has been restored to the list
of countries which the United States accuses of engaging in
international terrorism.
   Testifying before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Baker was
asked by Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., about ways the United States
might confront future security challenges in the Persian Gulf.
Solarz expressed particular concern about the presence of chemical
and biological weapons in the Iraqi arsenal.
   ``I think we will have to give consideration to working with
others to create a new security structure for the region,'' Baker
said. ``I think that's likely to be required even if there is a
pullback (by Iraq) from Kuwait.
   ``It is conceivably possible ... to come up with a security
structure that would make it so clearly to the detriment of any
subsequent leader, or even the present leader, to use or
contemplate using (chemical or biological) weapons that there would
be very little risk that they would be used.
   Such a structure would be aimed at ``constraining'' aggressors
such as Iraq, Baker said. He recalled that NATO was able to deal
with Soviet expansionist ambitions during the Cold War.
   In such a structure, ``Certainly we ought to play some role, and
therefore there would be some presence, some continuing presence
there,'' Baker said.
   ``Maybe it wouldn't be a ground force presence,'' he continued.
``Maybe it would be a naval presence. I mean, these are questions
that are going to have to be addressed down the line and they're
questions that are going to have to be studied considerably.''
   For about 40 years, the United States has maintained warships in
the Persian Gulf, sometimes only a small number, and a fleet in the
Mediterranean Sea.
   ``We would not like to have to repeat'' the U.S. buildup, Baker
said _ a buildup he estimated would cost $6 billion by the end of
the year.
   Baker told the committee that Iraq was restored to the terrorism
list after Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz said that Iraq was
free from any moral obligation to proscribe acts of terrorism
against American, British or French interests.
   Iraq had been on the State Department list of countries that
engage in state-supported terrorism but was removed from that list
as part of a general accommodation between the two countries during
the early 1980s.
   The other countries on the list are Syria, Libya, Cuba, North
Korea and Iran.
   Restoring Iraq to the list was largely a symbolic measure.
Membership on the list means the country in question is not
entitled to certain economic benefits, including agricultural
credits.
   In Iraq's case, there are no benefits to be suspended because of
the embargo the United States imposed on Iraq after its takeover of
Kuwait.
   A U.S. official, explaining the move, said ``we are deeply
cvoncerned over growing ties between Iraq and international
terrorists. Particularly disturbing is the movement of terrorist
groups and their leaders to Baghdad and calls issued through the
Iraqi news agency for attacks on American interests.''
   Specifically, the official, who requested anonymity, said Abu
Nidal and Abul Abbas, leaders of Palestinian factions, operate from
Baghdad.
   Abu Nidal is suspected in the bombings of Rome and Vienna
airports in December 1986. Abul Abbas reportedly was involved in
the attempted assault May 30 on Tel Aviv beaches. The abortive
attack prompted the Bush administration to suspend its talks with
the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Abul Abbas also is connected by the State Department office to
counter terrorism with the hijacking of the Italian cruise ship
Achille Lauro in 1985.
   Baker said he believes that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein may
be willing to pursue a negotiated settlement once the global
economic embargo has greater impact. He added, however, that Saddam
is showing no such disposition at present.
   ``We would like to see this matter resolved by peaceful means,''
Baker said. ``We do not believe in our heart of hearts that Saddam
Hussein is prepared to move forward on the diplomatic track.''
   Baker was accorded a generally friendly reception by House
members during his first appearance on Capitol Hill since the Gulf
crisis erupted five weeks ago. Virtually all committee members
praised Baker and the administration for the way in which they have
managed the crisis.
   Baker reaffirmed that the United States continues to seek a
complete withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait and the restoration
to power of the deposed Kuwaiti leadership.
   He said the United States should not be willing to compromise on
those demands.
   ``We can't have negotiations on what the future government of
Kuwait should or could be,'' he said. He did not rule out, however,
the possibility that territorial or other disputes could be
negotiated ``once there is a complete, full and unconditional
withdrawal from Kuwait.''

   South Korea asked North Korean
delegates Wednesday to agree to a proposal on easing tensions
between the two enemies that includes recognizing the others'
sovereignty, free travel and gradual arms reduction.
   The South's eight-point proposal was based on its conviction
that lesser agreements must precede talks on unification of the
peninsula, divided in 1945. North Korea believes the two Koreas can
only establish trust if they agree to the major issues of arms cuts
and reunification.
   The South's proposal came at the opening session of the
first-ever premiers talks between North and South Korea, the
highest level conference between the two rivals in 45 years.
   ``Should the authorities of both sides persist in
confrontational and hostile attitudes, inter-Korean relations will
never be improved,'' said South Korean Prime Minister Kang
Yoon-hoon.
   Kang, speaking first at the meeting, also proposed the two
governments work jointly to locate family members separated by the
Korean War. An estimated 10 million Koreans were separated from
family members during the 1950-53 conflict.
   Kang said multi-faceted exchanges and cooperation between the
two sides should include free travel across the border during major
holidays, economic and trade cooperation, reconnection of broken
railroad, highway, mail and telephone service lines, and
recognizing the others' existence.
   He suggested the two sides jointly develop tourist resources and
create a North-South tourist route in the beautiful eastern coast
called the Diamond Mountains, a haven favored by all Koreans.
   North and South Korea opened two days of formal prime ministers'
talks Wednesday at 10 a.m. (9 p.m. EDT Tuesday) with the
seven-member official delegations of both sides sitting across from
one another at a table in main ballroom of the headquarters hotel.
   The premiers smiled and shook hands across the table. When
photographers yelled for them to repeat the action, they stood for
about a minute clasping hands.
   North Korean Prime Minister Yon Hyong Muk, wearing a Communist
Party Kim Il Sung badge, waved briefly to onlookers and took his
seat on the north side of the table. The South Korean premier sat
on the south side.
   In a relaxed atmosphere, the two premiers exchanged small talk
about the previous evening's dinner and movie and whether each had
slept well.
   Kang apologized for a traffic accident in Tuesday's arrival
motorcade in which two North Korean diplomats were injured. When he
inquired how they were feeling, one of the delegates said he needed
treatment for his back and the other, who injured his jaw, said he
had trouble eating.
   Talks Wednesday and Thursday are to focus on easing military and
political confrontation and launching multilateral exchanges,
subjects general enough to cover almost anything either side wants
to talk about.
   By holding talks, Communist North Korea gives tacit recognition
to the legitimacy of the South Korean government it has steadfastly
refused to recognize. South Korea has recognized the North only in
its call that the two nations submit separate applications for
United Nations membership.
   South Korean Prime Minister Kang calls the talks thawing ``the
thick ice of distrust.''
   Kang said Tuesday the talks ``will be the perfect opportunity to
erect a glistening milestone in our long march to cast off the
shackales of division and unify the land.''
   South Korean officials have cautioned against hasty
expectations, saying the talks are only a significant first step of
a long road toward peace and unification.
   North Korean radio, monitored in Tokyo, warned Seoul to approach
talks ``with a sincere attitude ... and cease from spoiling the
atmosphere of dialogue.''
   The 90-member North Korean delegation crossed the border Tuesday
for a four-day visit that ends Friday and includes two movies, a
stage show and sightseeing.
   The premiers have opposing ideology, but otherwise much in
common. Both have roots near the North Korea-Manchurian border.
They're both in their 60s, were appointed premiers in 1988 and are
ranked high in their government hierarchy though their
policy-making roles are limited.
   The Korean peninsula was divided into the communist North and
capitalist South in 1945 and the two nations fought a three-year
war. Relations between the Koreas are hostile and the North Korean
delegation is only the third to visit in more than 40 years.
   Earlier Tuesday, about 200 radical students yelling
anti-government slogans and hurling more than 500 blazing firebombs
battled riot police at Seoul's Korea University. Eight students
were arrested for trying to take unification banners to the border
crossing.
   Radicals and dissidents are demanding immediate unification and
the withdrawal of about 43,000 U.S. troops, positions supported by
North Korea.
   Soon after their arrival, the North Koreans asked to visit the
families of South Korean dissidents jailed for illegally visiting
the North, but the government indicated the request would be
rejected.
   The North Korean prime minister is staying in a $1,500-a-day
Royal Suite at a luxury hotel near the Olympic Stadium, site of the
1988 Summer Games.

<HEAD>Saudis Open Doors to Foreign Media</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia has opened the
floodgates to more than 250 reporters, turning coverage of the U.S.
troop deployment into what one journalist called ``a media war.''
   ``It's phenomenal,'' Ray Wilkinson, Newsweek's Cairo-based
correspondent, said Aug. 27. Wilkinson had a visa request pending
for 18 months before he was granted one. ``I never thought I would
see the U.S. military in Saudi Arabia, and I never thought I would
see us here like this.''
   Saudi officials, speaking on condition they not be identified,
said the change in government policy came from the highest levels
and was partly in reaction to pressure from the United States.
   ``They know public opinion is important,'' one official said of
the Saudi leadership.
   Most reporters have been given month-long visas. One Saudi
official said major news organizations may be given a permanent
presence in the kingdom.
   The arrival of hundreds of journalists prompted the U.S. Defense
Department to disband its 17-member media pool Aug. 26, two weeks
after the first journalists arrived in the country. Under the pool
arrangement, writers, photographers and television journalists made
their work available to all news organizations.
   Some pool reporters complained about restrictions imposed by the
Pentagon but praised the access they were given to on-the-ground
operations.
   Most irksome was the Pentagon's initial prohibition on the use
of soldiers' names and hometowns. On Aug. 25 the Pentagon lifted
the ban, saying the military situation had relaxed.
   The Pentagon and the Saudi government still bar reporters from
using exact locations when writing about military activities.
   Navy Lt. Cmdr. Gregg Hartung, the pool coordinator, said he
thought the pool worked better than in the past. During the
December invasion of Panama, for example, reporters were furious at
being penned up away from any action for 24 hours.
   ``I think we still have room for improvement,'' Hartung said.
For instance, he would have liked daily briefings with ``Operation
Desert Shield'' commanders to give up-to-date details of the
deployment.
   But that was impossible because the operation was run out of
Riyadh, the Saudi capital, while the reporters were based 200 miles
away in Dhahran, scene of the major deployment.
   The invasion of reporters has created a new set of headaches for
American and Saudi officials.
   So many people are vying for limited space on official tours
that the Pentagon has given first priority to American reporters.
   The Saudis have also been besieged by reporters trying to get on
sponsored trips. A near riot broke out among reporters pushing to
get on buses when the Saudis took a group to the border with Iraq.
   ``It's a media war. That's the main feature,'' said Alix Van
Buren of La Repubblica of Italy.
   ``Bring in a couple thousand copies of `Scoop,''' said Time
Magazine's Jay Peterzell, referring to Evelyn Waugh's satirical
novel about covering an African war. ``A lot of people want to
reread it.''

   Developments in the Mideast conflict have
highlighted again the effect of news coverage on diplomacy.
   Diplomacy ``used to be by cable, and now it's by satellite,''
said Steve Friedman, executive producer of NBC's ``Nightly News.''
   ``I think it's fraught with danger, in terms of television's
`live' incapacity to really interpret some of these events,'' said
Reid Collins, CNN anchorman in Washington.
   ``The problem is that communication is instant, reaction is
instant, and everybody needs to just slow down,'' said anchorman
Jim Lehrer of ``The MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour'' on the Public
Broadcasting Service.
   Diplomacy by television was born in the Middle East when the
1967 Arab-Israeli war divided the principals behind battle lines.
   ``When you are unable to have diplomatic contact, the reporter
is the one who is able to get the message,'' said Barbara Walters,
who covered the Middle East for ABC in the '70s.
   ``I would go and interview (Egyptian President) Anwar Sadat,
then I would have to go to Israel by way of Cyprus, because the two
countries had no direct links and were technically at war, and I
would talk with Prime Minister (Yitzhak) Rabin'' of Israel, she
said.
   ``I remember the feeling of responsibility, and I would think
how ironic and how sad it was that a reporter was going around
delivering messages between people who could not speak.''
   The role of television and the TV journalist as mediator reached
its high point in 1977, when CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite
simultaneously interviewed Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin.
   On the ``neutral ground'' of television, Cronkite asked Sadat if
he would visit Israel. Yes, Sadat would go to Israel. Would Sadat
be welcome in Jerusalem, Cronkite asked. Yes, was the answer.
   The next day, Israel's invitation arrived in Cairo. It was,
CNN's Collins said, ``the genesis of the Camp David accords'' and
Egyptian-Israeli peace.
   ``Wire services and newspapers have been doing this for a long
time, probably more than a century,'' said Robert MacNeil,
co-anchor of ``The MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour.'' ``It's just that
television has speeded it up.''
   TV diplomacy can hinder the understanding of events, Collins
said. And television's desire to know the end of the story and to
summarize events that most often defy summarization can be
dangerous, he said.
   ``If every man and woman in television who did a standup left
off the last line, the world would be much better served,'' Collins
said.
   ``This is not a television show. ... This is a real-world
confrontation,'' said Lehrer.

<HEAD>American Journalist Escapes After Being Trapped in Kuwait</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Washington Post reporter Caryle Murphy
willingly traveled to Kuwait in late July to cover an unfolding
international news event. She escaped a month later, holding
preciously to her stories and her life.
   When Murphy arrived in Kuwait City, Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein was amassing thousands of troops from his million-man army
along the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border, but still promising he would take
no military action against his tiny neighbor.
   In the early morning hours of on Aug. 2, a week after Murphy's
arrival, Iraqi soldiers quickly rolled over Kuwait.
   One failed escape attempt and 25 days later, Murphy arrived in
Saudi Arabia after a tense journey across the desert.
   The journalist related her trials in a lengthy article published
in The Washington Post.
   Despite the turmoil in Kuwait after the invasion, Murphy said
she hadn't expected to be trapped.
   ``... Like most foreigners, I assumed that in a few days time
the borders would be open for those who wanted to leave, and that
the exodus would start. But it never happened,'' she wrote.
   Murphy recalled that she and two other Western journalists spent
the first week after the invasion conducting interviews on the
streets, in hospitals and over the telephone, ``as if we were
covering any story.'' However, she soon discovered that there was
no way to dispatch material to her newspaper.
   After leaving her hotel to live with an American family, Murphy
decided to flee the country as the two other journalists already
had done.
   Murphy and two other Americans set out by car on the morning of
Aug. 14. They were back in Kuwait City 90 minutes later after being
turned back by Iraqi soldiers.
   But Murphy decided to try again after she learned of a convoy
that was planning to leave.
   ``I decided in a minute, mostly by instinct. I reasoned that the
worst that could happen was that I would be detained if the Iraqi's
spotted me,'' she wrote.
   Nearly seven hours later, Murphy arrived at the Saudi border.
There, she learned from a U.S. diplomat that she was the first
American to arrive at the outpost in eight days.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Names New Press Spokesman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev beefed up his press
office Aug. 28 by naming a respected Soviet magazine editor as his
personal assistant and chief spokesman.
   Vitaly N. Ignatenko is editor of the New Times magazine, which
under his stewardship has played a significant role in Gorbachev's
policy of glasnost, or openness.
   Ignatenko is expected to play a larger role in policy-making
than either his predecessor, Arkady Maslennikov, or his American
counterpart, Marlin Fitzwater.
   Ignatenko, 49, who speaks some English, is one of a handful of
top Soviet journalists who reputedly have enjoyed regular access to
Gorbachev and gained his confidence.
   One sign of his influence is his title: assistant to the
president and head of the presidential press service. The assistant
to the president designation is new.
   Maslennikov, whose performance was widely viewed as lackluster,
has returned to his former position as press aide to the chairman
of the Supreme Soviet legislature.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov, who
announced the changes at a news conference, said Maslennikov would
begin working for Anatoly Lukyanov, Gorbachev's successor as
Supreme Soviet chairman.
   Maslennikov developed a reputation among both Soviet and foreign
reporters in Moscow for being difficult to reach and not returning
phone calls. He also made some high profile mistakes _ such as
failing to put down a rumor about Gorbachev's health during his
June summit meeting with President Bush.
   Asked at a press conference in Washington whether it was true
Gorbachev planned to undergo testing for diabetes in Minnesota,
Maslennikov replied that there were many scientific experts in
Minnesota with whom the Soviet leader might consult. His answer
allowed the rumor to live for several hours before being firmly
denied by other Soviet officials.
   Ignatenko has a reputation for accessibility and clarity.
   ``He is easygoing, with a very good sense of humor,'' said his
deputy at Novoye Vremya (New Times), Aleksandr Pumpyansky. ``But
he's also a professional journalist whose language is very precise
_ he knows all the nuances.''
   The weekly magazine, which is published in Russian and several
other languages, including English, has published articles critical
of the Soviet military and some of its allies, such as Cuba. This
summer it carried a revisionist history of the Korean War, laying
considerable blame on the North Korean side for the first time.

<HEAD>Former Hostage Says Anderson Well When Last Seen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Lebanon hostage Brian Keenan said
he saw Terry Anderson in captivity about 11 months ago and the
Associated Press correspondent was well.
   Keenan, a native of Belfast, Northern Ireland, was handed over
to Irish authorities in Syria on Aug. 25.
   He described the 42-year-old Anderson as pacing the floor in
tattered socks with a ``voracious appetite for intellectual
conversation.''
   He said Anderson sometimes kept him awake for hours.
   ``I think he debated with himself a lot while we tried to plug
our ears,'' Keenan joked.
   Keenan said guards sometimes gave Anderson antibiotics during
bouts of stomach trouble.
   ``Terry and myself would sit through those long nights and speak
with great pain and remorse and longing for his first daughter,
Gabrielle. With many tears he would elaborate his plans when he was
finally back in the States to help her to shape and discover her
future.
   ``In those confessional moments which were common to us all, a
deep and enduring and unbreakable bond was formed.''
   Anderson has never seen his second daughter, Sulome, born three
months after he was abducted.
   Anderson, the AP's chief Middle East correspondent, was abducted
March 16, 1985, and is the longest held of the 13 Westerners.

<HEAD>Advocates Mildly Encouraged by Souter's First Amendment Views</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defenders of First Amendment rights lament the
retirement of Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan but say the
views of his prospective replacement, David H. Souter, on freedom
of speech and the press are somewhat encouraging.
   ``No one could conclude he has an ax to grind against the media
or against First Amendment claims,'' Henry Kaufman of the pro-media
Libel Defense Resource Center said of Souter. ``Arguably, we will
get a fair hearing. But he's no Brennan.''
   Brennan retired in July after a 34-year career as the high
court's leading voice of liberalism. He wrote a 1964 landmark
opinion giving the news media broad protection against libel suits
by public figures and recently wrote opinions barring criminal
prosecution of those who burn the American flag in protest.
   The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to begin hearings on
Souter's nomination Sept. 13. Most of what is known of his views
have come from his writings as a New Hampshire state judge.
   President Bush named Souter to the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Boston this year.
   Some who have studied the handful of opinions Souter wrote on
First Amendment issues during his seven years on the New Hampshire
Supreme Court say they are heartened that Bush didn't choose
someone with apparent rigid ideas that could limit free expression.
   ``I think he's been very balanced on free-press issues,'' said
Claudia Haskell of the First Amendment Congress. ``He's in the
mainstream.''
   However, the advocates said they don't expect Souter to be an
ardent defender of free expression if he wins confirmation.
   Kaufman said Souter's opinions seem to reflect more interest
``in the complexity of the law ... than a passion for the
underlying rights at issue.''
   Souter's ``decisions seem to reflect a cautious craftsman whose
views are not expansive in protecting First Amendment rights,''
said Floyd Abrams, a New York lawyer whose clients include the news
media.
   Some commentators said they were encouraged that Souter had
expressed, in cases unrelated to the First Amendment, strong
support for Supreme Court precedent.
   Jane Kirtley, head of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the
Press, said she was pleased that Souter appears to have little
inclination to topple key rulings.
   ``Let's face it, we've got some good court decisions sitting up
there right now,'' she said. ``I don't see anything that would
suggest (Souter) would be anti-media.''

<HEAD>Newspaper Devoted to Arrest Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEMINOLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fed up with big-city newspapers' missing
all but the most sensational crimes, a Florida man is publishing a
tabloid listing every local arrest, including those for alleged
shoplifting and drunken driving.
   The Informer plans to fight crime by filling pages with a
blotter-style listing of every suspect _ even though they're
innocent until proven guilty.
   ``This is going to be a deterrent,'' said Publisher Ray Aden.
``What is happening is the great majority of people violating our
laws are not known _ to their neighbors, their bosses, sometimes
even their family.
   ``But nobody wants to get their name in the paper.''
   Some daily newspapers already print crime blotter information.
There's nothing unlawful about printing arrests from the public
record. But civil libertarians and attorneys say the tabloid is
treading dangerous legal ground and could trample the rights of the
accused.
   From a small office in this St. Petersburg suburb, Aden and a
handful of employees are busy preparing for the Oct. 3 premiere of
the twice-monthly, 89-cent publication.
   Aden, a 70-year-old marketing analyst, has spent nine months and
more than $150,000 getting ready. The paper will be about half
advertising and half listings of arrests, along with articles such
as ``How To Deal With Obscene Phone Calls.''
   The area's big dailies report only a few arrests a day, focusing
on major murders and drug busts. But each issue of The Informer is
designed to bulge up to 48 pages and list hundreds of arrests in
St. Petersburg, Clearwater and surrounding Pinellas County
communities.
   All of them list only the standard booking information: name,
address, age and arresting charge.
   ``We're not crime reporting or editorializing _ that's not the
concept,'' Aden said. ``We give the community information. ... It
probably will evolve into more area crime watches, which will
benefit the community.''
   And on every page, beneath boldface headlines reading ``Domestic
Violence'' and ``Shoplifting,'' disclaimers in the newspaper's
tiniest type read, ``Note: being arrested does not mean the person
is guilty.''
   ``They have an absolute right to print arrests,'' said Robyn
Blumner, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union
in Florida. ``But I would only hope the public is smart enough to
know that arrests by themselves are legally irrelevant.''
   Patricia Anderson, a libel attorney whose clients include the
St. Petersburg Times, said publishing arrests is fine, but they had
better be accurate.
   ``One wrong first name or one wrong middle initial and you could
have a big lawsuit on your hands,'' she said.

<HEAD>Selected Details of Times-Bass Settlement Released</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A non-profit journalism school run
by the Times Publishing Co. will not be hurt by a secret stock
settlement between the newspaper company and a Texas billionaire,
the school said Aug. 31 in a letter to state Attorney General Bob
Butterworth.
   In the letter, the Poynter Institute of Media Studies released
selected details of the Aug. 17 agreement between the owners of the
St. Petersburg Times and an investment group led by Robert Bass.
   The institute is a beneficiary of profits from the newspaper
company and had been a focal point of the bitter war between the
Times and the Bass group.
   The details released by institute President Robert Haiman showed
the settlement would improve the institute's finances, not hurt
them.
   According to the newly released data, preferred stock held by
the institute would be replaced by a $30 million debenture paying
an annual interest rate of 13 percent and maturing in 2002.
   Annual income from the debenture would total $3.9 million, more
than the $3.2 million in stock dividends the institute received in
1989, Haiman said. The release also said the institute could expect
to receive dividends from the common stock it holds in the
publishing company.

<HEAD>Unions Asking Advertisers To Boycott Daily News</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unions at the Daily News, working without a
contract since March 30, said they were sending out letters Sept. 4
asking advertisers to immediately stop placing ads in the newspaper.
   The letters were being sent to all News advertisers and ad
agencies that do business with the newspaper, George McDonald,
president of the Allied Printing Trades Council, told New York
Newsday.
   If the advertisers refuse, ``We'll see how they like 500 or 600
people leafleting outside their doors,'' Richard Weiss, an Allied
spokesman told the Daily News.
   The advertising boycott does not have full union support. The
News said more than 90 Newspaper Guild members have signed a
petition calling the boycott ``illogical and counter-productive.''
The printers union, one of 10 unions in the council, also said it
will not support the boycott, according to the newspaper.
   The News has been running a series of radio ads in which
advertisers praise the 1.2-million-circulation paper's drawing

<HEAD>Chain Letter a Hit Among Media Executives</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A chain letter circulated since early this
year among media executives in New York and Washington has some
participants worried _ in a manner of speaking. The anonymous
letter warns of bad luck for whoever breaks the chain.
   Arthur Sulzberger Jr., deputy publisher of The New York Times,
sent copies of his letter to five friends, including Random House
executive Peter Osnos.
   ``You'd think I would have more courage than to send it on to
you,'' Sulzberger wrote.
   ``A man will do anything out of fear,'' wrote Benjamin Bradlee,
executive editor of The Washington Post, who once tangled
fearlessly with President Nixon over his newspaper's Watergate
exposes.
   Bradlee received his letter from Shelby Coffey III, editor of
the Los Angeles Times, who passed it along with a brief note
asking, ``How can it hurt?''
   Syndicated humor columnist Art Buchwald sent his copy to five
women friends, including Cosmopolitan Publisher Helen Gurley Brown
and columnist Ann Landers.
   ``I've been asked to send this chain letter on to my five
dearest friends,'' Buchwald wrote. ``This is the best sex I ever
had.'' He added a warning that ``the last person to break this
chain was seated next to (talk show host) Morton Downey Jr. at a
dinner party.''
   Buchwald had gotten his copy from Pierre Salinger of ABC News,
who wrote in June: ``Having received this letter on my 65th
birthday, I have no choice but to send it on as ordered. I am
getting too old to take a chance of breaking the chain.''
   At least one media heavyweight has been brave _ or foolish _
enough to ignore the warning.
   Jack Nelson, Washington bureau chief of the Los Angeles Times,
said he received the chain letter from two friends, but was too
busy covering the Persian Gulf crisis and writing a book to pay any
attention.
   ``So far my luck's been pretty good,'' he said. ``Maybe it's
working the other way for me.''

   Cartoonist Gary Trudeau's popular
``Doonesbury'' characters are getting some unintended and unwanted
circulation.
   U.S. Postal Service officials are complaining that Trudeau's
characters, which were featured in a cartoon stamp album of
political satire, are turning up on some mail.
   Art Shealy, a spokesman for the Postal Service in Washington,
said Aug. 29 that postal employees were advised to be on the
lookout for the bogus stamps.
   The 1990 Doonesbury Stamp Album is a collection of more than 140
stamps featuring characters from the Pulitzer Prize-winning strip.
   The $8.95 book is intended to raise money for the Writers'
Voices program of the Literacy Volunteers of New York City, said
Janet Kraybill, spokeswoman for the publisher.
   ``I don't see how anyone could look at this and think it's a
postage stamp,'' said Ms. Kraybill. ``There are purple ones and
pink ones, and some are even larger than a postage stamp.''
   Genuine U.S. postal stamps have a phosphorus coating which
canceling machines are supposed to detect. But Shealy said the
machines don't catch all bogus stamps on the 530 million pieces of
mail processed daily in the United States.

<HEAD>Giago Again Plans National String of Indian Newspapers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RAPID CITY, S.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lakota Times Publisher Tim Giago said he
wants to start a national network of Indian-owned newspapers using
his own paper as a training center.
   In 1987, Giago announced plans to open a Sioux Falls plant to
print a chain of weekly newspapers for Indian reservations, along
with plans to start a weekly on the Red Lake Chippewa Reservation
near Bemidji, Minn. The printing plant was never built. The
newspaper folded in 1988 after 48 issues.
   ``The lessons we learned with our attempted expansion into
Chippewa country a few years back have not been lost to us,'' Giago
said in a Times story Aug. 28
   ``We went in undercapitalized and, in reality, underprepared,
but that is how one learns in this touchy field of business.''
   Giago said he will prepare himself for the new venture by
enrolling in advanced business courses at Harvard while on a
one-year Nieman Fellowship that begins this fall.
   Native American Publishing, Inc., the parent corporation of the
Lakota Times, will be restructured with an eye to national
expansion next spring, the Times story said.
   As part of the plan, the stock options of the company will be
changed in order to offer shares for sale to a limited number of
private investors.

   The publisher of Smart magazine said Aug. 30 he
was near a final agreement to merge that general interest men's
publication with a men's magazine that was being readied for launch
next year.
   Publisher Owen Lipstein said he had agreed to buy the proposed

   In addition, Lipstein said the co-founders of Men, Publisher

   New American Magazine publishes Mother Earth News and Psychology
Today as well as Smart. The company has been having financial
problems, but got a cash infusion in August when a Japanese media
company bought a 50 percent interest.
   The proposed merger of Smart and Men comes as a number of new or

<HEAD>Some Press Rights Upheld in Alleged Sexual Abuse Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pennsylvania's Superior Court says a newspaper
can attend hearings on sexual abuse allegations involving a priest
and see some court papers, but not all of those produced in
preparation for the case.
   The Aug. 28 ruling was the first by an appeals court in the
state to uphold access to civil pleadings and proceedings,
Pittsburgh Press attorney Scott E. Henderson said.
   ``This will make it easier for the public and press to view
those parts of the judicial process,'' he said.
   The Superior Court decision said the newspaper does not have
access to ``discovery documents,'' or information developed by the
two sides in a case to prepare for trial.
   The case is based on a lawsuit filed by an Akron, Ohio, man who
says he was 9 or 10 years old when he was first sexually molested
by the Rev. Francis E. Luddy.
   The 21-year-old man says the abuse occurred for six to seven
years.
   Luddy was assigned to the Altoona-Johnstown Diocese at the time
and is now on a leave of absence.
   The diocese had requested that all documents in the case be
sealed and all pretrial proceedings be held behind closed doors.
   A lower court judge denied both requests, and was reversed on
the issue of discovery arguments.
   In doing so, the Superior Court referred to an earlier decision
it issued that said there was no legal right for the public to
inspect discovery materials.

<HEAD>Singapore Tightens Grip on Foreign Publications</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many foreign newspapers and magazines will need
official permits to circulate in Singapore under an amendment to
the press law passed by Parliament on Aug. 30.
   In tightening controls on overseas publications, the government
served notice ``that it is a privilege and not a right for foreign
newspapers to circulate in Singapore,'' said Mah Bow Tan, a
minister of state.
   ``They do so as foreign observers of the local scene and should
not interfere in the domestic politics of Singapore,'' Mah said.
   The amendment to the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act applies
to publications circulating more than 300 copies at intervals of
one week or less with articles ``pertaining to the politics and
current affairs of any country in Southeast Asia.''
   It is not aimed at a specific publication and not intended to
prevent the free flow of information, Mah told Parliament.
   Until now, publications printed outside Singapore did not need
distribution permits, unlike local newspapers and magazines.
   A permit, valid for one year and renewable, may be refused or
revoked without explanation under the amended law. It will specify
the number of copies to be sold and require the appointment of a
local agent to accept any legal notices.
   The amended law also calls for a security deposit to be posted
against any court costs or other legal liabilities incurred by the
publication.
   The bill was introduced on July 18 and becomes law after it is
signed by President Wee Kim Wee. It followed an announcement in
April by Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong that the government
was planning to make regional publications subject to the country's
jurisdiction.
   Goh commented after the government reported difficulties in
serving notices on The Asian Wall Street Journal over a recent
contempt of court action and a defamation suit.

   The attorney general dropped charges
against four policemen accused of abducting and killing a
correspondent for the Inter Press Service earlier this year.
   Colombo Magistrate Rohini Walgama discontinued the case Aug. 30
after the attorney general's counsel said there was insufficient
evidence to prosecute the policemen.
   The attorney for the reporter's family claimed the killing was
political and the investigation was improper.
   Richard De Zoysa, the Colombo correspondent for the Rome-based
news agency, was taken from his home Feb. 18 by six armed men in a
jeep similar to those used by the police, his family had said. His
body was found with gunshot wounds washed ashore on the beach at
Moratuwa, 10 miles south of the capital.
   The government denied the military or police were involved in
the killing and ordered a police investigation.
   De Zoysa's mother, Manorani Saravanamuttu, said she witnessed
his abduction. On June 1 she submitted affidavits identifying
policemen she claimed were involved, including a senior
superintendent.
   State counsel Anura Meddegoda said four affidavits produced by
Mrs. Saravanamuttu contained several major contradictions and the

<HEAD>Iraqi Videotape Raises Journalistic Question</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cable News Network's decision to air Iraqi
satellite transmissions live, including one segment of tape that
showed a meeting between Saddam Hussein and Western hostages,
became the focus of journalistic debate.
   ``We would not do that under any circumstances,'' said Bob
McFarland, NBC deputy director of news. ``We made that decision the
first day they pumped it out. We decided it was pure propaganda.''
   None of the big three American networks _ NBC, ABC and CBS _
aired the Iraqi transmission live on Aug. 28, as CNN did. Instead,
they showed portions somewhat later.
   CNN said the meeting was important enough to show as quickly as
possible.
   ``We make these decisions on a case-by-case basis,'' said CNN
spokesman Steve Haworth, adding that CNN understood that Saddam
would be speaking with American hostages. ``There was no question
in our minds this would be newsworthy.''
   CNN explained to viewers that the broadcast was an Iraqi TV
feed. And afterward, CNN featured a debate over the wisdom of the
decisions it had made.
   It's a decision the other networks see differently.
   At NBC, ``we would not put Iraqi TV on the air without first
knowing what it was,'' McFarland said. ``We took every frame of it
into the house, looked at it, and then selected two or three
bites.''
   ``Wherever there is a hostage videotape, a captive videotape,
it's a decision we don't take lightly,'' said Sherrie Rollins, ABC
director of news information. The president of ABC News has to
approve the use of such video, she said.
   When Saddam appeared on television on Aug. 23 with Western
hostages, ABC joined the Iraqi satellite feed live for a few
moments after first viewing the transmission to gauge the content
of the material.
   ``We did air the material; we did feel it was newsworthy,'' Ms.
Rollins said.
   But when Saddam appeared with hostages again Aug. 28, ABC taped
the material and showed only a brief portion during a special
report by anchorman Peter Jennings, she said.
   After the first appearance on CNN, Pati Heath of Detroit, the
sister of an American hostage, called the Atlanta-based network to
say she had seen her brother on TV.
   CNN then put her on television, too.
   ``I'm just happy to be able to see my brother's face,'' she
said. ``I hope Hussein sees me talking right now.''
   The first U.S. interview with Saddam went to CBS news anchor Dan
Rather, on Aug. 29.
   CBS said the taped interview lasted 90 minutes and began shortly
after midnight in Baghdad. Rather was told there would be no
interview that day, but suddenly was summoned to the presidential
palace.
   There were no restrictions on what Rather could ask, said CBS
spokeswoman Donna Dees. The only conditions were that Iraqi TV
cameras be used and that it be a one-hour interview that would air
as recorded, she said.
   He agreed to let the interview run longer so it could be cut for
translation and minor editing, Dees said.

<HEAD>TV News Gets High Ratings During Gulf Crisis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Persian Gulf crisis has created a thirst
for news that has lifted the ratings of everything from ``Face the
Nation'' to ``60 Minutes.''
   CBS' ``60 Minutes'' was the most-watched show on prime-time
television for the second consecutive week, the A.C. Nielsen Co.
said Aug. 28. It was the program's first back-to-back No. 1
victories since 1983, when it was the top-rated show for the year.
   Viewership of six Sunday news and information programs _ ``Face
the Nation'' and ``Sunday Morning'' on CBS; ``This Week with David
Brinkley'' and ``Business World'' on ABC, and NBC's ``Meet the
Press'' and ``Sunday Today'' _ rose 27.7 percent since Iraq's Aug.
2 invasion of Kuwait, Nielsen reported.
   The most-watched nightly network news program belonged to ABC
and Peter Jennings, with a 10.4 average. CBS and Dan Rather were
second with 10.2 and NBC and Tom Brokaw was last with 8.9.

<HEAD>Wayne Newton's $5.2 Million Judgment Overturned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $5.2 million libel damage award to singer
Wayne Newton from NBC was overturned Aug. 30 by a federal appeals
court. It said a broadcast suggesting mob ties in Newton's purchase
of a casino was not shown to be deliberately or recklessly false.
   A jury in Las Vegas found that the television network's October
1980 story about a federal investigation of the singer's
acquisition of the Aladdin Hotel and Casino had created a false
impression that criminal organizations had helped in the purchase
in exchange for a hidden share and that Newton had deceived Nevada
gaming officials.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 3-0 ruling, said
most of the factual statements in the broadcast were undisputed,
and that any false impressions had not been shown to be deliberate
or reckless.
   For example, the court said, citing evidence in the case, Newton
had contacted a purported organized crime figure, Guido Penosi,
about a problem; Penosi had arranged a solution, and Penosi and an
associate later discussed the possibility of profiting from
Newton's ownership of the Aladdin, a subject that came under
federal investigation.
   Newton testified that he asked Penosi to stop organized crime
threats against himself and his daughter. That subject was not
mentioned in the NBC story. The court said Newton had testified
falsely to the state Gaming Board about his relationship with
Penosi.
   The court did not say whether the story as a whole was false _
an issue it did not have to address. Instead, it found a lack of
evidence that the journalists had either deliberately lied or had
been reckless with the truth. That standard must be met by public
figures or public officials suing the news media for libel.
   The court said U.S. District Judge Myron Crocker, who reduced
the jury's $19.3 million libel award to $5.2 million, erroneously
allowed the damages to be based on a conclusion that NBC should
have realized its broadcast would give a false impression.
   What journalists should have realized or foreseen is irrelevant
in a libel suit by a public figure, which must be based on what a
journalist actually knew and intended, said the appellate decision
by Judge William Norris.
   He said Crocker also improperly ``substituted (his) own view as
to the supposed impression left by the broadcast for that of the
journalists who prepared the broadcast.''
   Newton had argued that the story's failure to mention the
threats against him as the reason he had contacted Penosi was a
deliberate omission of the truth. But Norris said the reporters had
reasons to doubt that threats had been made, noting that they had
gotten a denial from Newton's lawyer.
   Norris said the broadcast's statement that Newton had financial
problems at the time of the purchase was true. The broadcast had
some ambiguities about his financial arrangements and testimony,
which might have been cleared up by different wording, but
``editorial decisions about broadcasts are best left to editors,
not to judges and juries,'' Norris said.

<HEAD>Bush Gives Green Light to TV Marti</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Aug. 27 that the Voice of
America television station aimed at Cuban viewers has passed a
five-month preliminary test and will become a permanent operation.
   TV Marti has been broadcasting news, movies and shows such as
``Cheers'' and ``Mission Impossible'' on a trial basis since March
27. Cuba has jammed the broadcasts since the first day and has said
that effort has been virtually 100 per cent successful.
   Bush's announcement releases $16 million that had been withheld
pending a presidential determination that the operation was both
legal and technically feasible.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the testing
period demonstrated that TV Marti did not interfere with Florida
television broadcasting and did not violate international
telecommunications agreements.
   Cuban President Fidel Castro has denounced TV Marti as illegal
and a ``gross interference'' in Cuba's internal affairs.

<HEAD>Werner Leaves ESPN</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roger Werner, who solidified ESPN's dominant
role in cable television by acquiring rights to major league
baseball and retaining the network's contract with the NFL, quit
Aug. 29 as president and chief executive officer.
   Werner will become president and CEO of Prime Ventures Inc., a
new company being formed by Bill Daniels, who has interests in
several regional cable networks.
   No successor was named immediately by ESPN, an 11-year-old
venture that was one of the first major steps into cable
television. The network, which has 56 million subscribers, is 80
percent owned by Capital Cities-ABC and 20 percent by RJR Nabisco.
   Herb Granath, president of Cap Cities video enterprises and
chairman of ESPN, said that Werner was not fired and left on his
own. Both Granath and Werner said money was not an issue but would
not comment if equity ownership was.
   They also denied that losses in the baseball package were the
reason for Werner's departure. ESPN said it will lose between $30
million and $40 million this year after projecting a $31 million
loss.
   Last year, the network agreed to a $400 million, four-year
contract with baseball that began this season. Its coverage is now
dominated by baseball for half the year, with single games on
Wednesday and Sunday and doubleheaders on Tuesday and Friday. A
total of 175 games each season are being shown.
   Last March, the ESPN retained its rights to eight Sunday night
NFL games each season, but the price went up from $150 million from
1987-89 to $450 million for 1990-93.
   Granath said that profits for ESPN would be down slightly this
year, but that was anticipated because of the baseball startup
costs.

<HEAD>Watson To President of Consolidated Gannett Division</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gary Watson, a 21-year veteran of Gannett Co.
Inc., has been named president of a newly consolidated newspaper
division in the company.
   Watson has been president of its 60-member community newspaper
division for the past 4{ years. The division will be combined with
Gannett's metropolitan newspaper group, whose current president,
Brian J. Donnelly, will become executive vice president reporting
to Watson.
   Watson will oversee all of Gannett's daily papers except USA
Today after the change, scheduled for Oct. 1.
   In a story Aug. 30, The Washington Post said Watson's promotion
fueled rumors that he was being groomed to become president and
chief operating officer.
   Mimi Feller, Gannett's vice president for public affairs, denied
speculation that he would become second-in-command to Gannett
Chairman-President John J. Curley.
   Feller said the company's chief financial officer, Douglas H.
McCorkindale, and USA Today Publisher Cathleen P. Black would
remain in those positions.
   ``There have been no changes in Cathy Black's or Doug's
positions. And there are no (additional) changes coming up in
Gary's position,'' she said.
   Watson, according to the Post, said the consolidation was partly
in response to the increasingly tough environment for newspaper
advertising.
   Gannett's newspaper revenue fell 2 percent in the second quarter
compared with a year ago and was down 1 percent for the first six
months of this year.
   But Feller said the Post was ``off base'' when it implied that
economics was the reason for the change. She said the consolidation
and promotion of Watson ``just makes sense organizationally'' at
this time.
   She said Gannett created the two newspaper divisions in 1985
when ``we were making some larger acquisitions of papers. ... But
now we've found that it would be better to have it in one place.
You don't need to have the overlap.''
   She said the change would not mean any reductions in personnel.
   ``It's totally an administrative restructuring, not a reduction
in personnel or savings in costs,'' she said, noting that both
divisions previously had been operating under one corporate staff.
``The corporate staff stays the same. The folks running the papers
in the field stay the same.''
   Watson, 45, started with Gannett in 1969 at its Rockford (Ill.)
Register Star. He held various editing and reporting jobs with the
company, and later was named president of its Midwestern newspaper
division and president of The Cincinnati Enquirer.

   The Rev. Jesse Jackson's interview with Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein and some former hostages will be shown in a four-part
series starting Sept. 4 on ``Inside Edition.'' Iraqi officials cut
from the tape a warning by Saddam that foreigners hiding from Iraqi
forces in Kuwait could be treated as spies, said producer Ken
Walker. It was Jackson's debut as a reporter. He was paid $125,000
for the costs of getting himself and his 14-member crew to Iraq,
the show's representatives said.

   President Bush is sending two high-level
delegations on a global search for billions of dollars to support
the economic and military campaign against Iraq.
   But given the puny response before the missions even left, some
observers wondered whether getting the allies to contribute money
will prove almost as tough as persuading Iraq's Saddam Hussein to
leave Kuwait.
   To emphasize the importance of the mission, Bush selected two of
his closest Cabinet advisers, Secretary of State James A. Baker III
and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, to head the delegations.
   Brady was leaving today for Paris and meetings with top French
officials in a globe-trotting trip that in four days also will take
him to London, Seoul, South Korea; and Tokyo.

   Defenders of First Amendment rights lament the
retirement of Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan but say the
views of his prospective replacement, David H. Souter, on freedom
of speech and the press are somewhat encouraging.
   ``No one could conclude he has an ax to grind against the media
or against First Amendment claims,'' Henry Kaufman of the pro-media
Libel Defense Resource Center said of Souter. ``Arguably, we will
get a fair hearing. But he's no Brennan.''
   Brennan retired in July after a 34-year career as the high
court's leading voice of liberalism. He wrote a 1964 landmark
opinion giving the news media broad protection against libel suits
by public figures and recently authored opinions barring criminal
prosecution of those who burn the American flag in protest.
   The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to begin hearings on
Souter's nomination Sept. 13. Most of what is known of his views
have come from his writings as a New Hampshire state judge.

   Bread, one of the few foods Soviet consumers have
been able to obtain easily, is now in short supply in Moscow for
the first time since the early 1960s.
   Despite a record grain harvest this year, many of Moscow's bread
stores were empty on Monday, and there were long lines at others.
   Some irate consumers blamed President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
economic reforms.
   ``That's perestroika _ we're not moving forward, we're going
backward,'' said Viktor Lyubeznov, a 52-year-old electrician who
went to four Moscow bread stores before finding a loaf.
   Russians have long been accustomed to shortages of fresh
vegetables, fruits and meat. They have no microwave foods, and no
24-hour convenience stores. But heavy Russian bread, baked in
central factories and sold at subsidized prices, has always been
fresh and plentiful.
   The last time people remember long bread lines was under former
Premier Nikita Khrushchev, who was ousted in 1964.

   Backers say the 62-year-old incumbent is a visionary leader who
deserves an unprecedented fourth term, while critics call him
``Governor Goofy'' or say he's simply been around too long.
   If voters endorse the latter view in the Sept. 11

   The race is a dead heat, according to a recent public opinion

<HEAD>Three American Films to Profile Performer Josephine Baker</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH HASTINGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Singer Josephine Baker was black, danced
naked and reveled in her sexuality. From the 1920s until she died
15 years ago, most Americans shunned her.
   Yet Europeans loved the performer and her skin color, and found
little risque in her blatant exposure of it. When Baker was
penniless toward the end of her life, Princess Grace of Monaco
cared for her.
   Suddenly, eight decades after her birth, she now is the focus of
three American films. But it hardly denotes a surge in social
consciousness. The story of these movies is mostly about money,
big-name stars and rushing to capitalize on a very marketable story
_ and how that process escalates once someone makes the first move.
   Home Box Office has the only completed version: ``The Josephine
Baker Story'' will debut on the pay cable channel in February 1991.
The HBO version, starring relative unknown Lynn Whitfield, cost $8
million and is the most expensive movie ever made by the
18-year-old network.
   In March, rival media mogul Ted Turner promised to deliver ``a
major announcement'' during a press conference held the day after
the Academy Awards ceremony.
   At the Beverly Hills gathering, Turner giddily presented
singer-actress Diana Ross and proclaimed the former Supremes leader
would be the executive producer and star of a three-hour cable
movie about Baker for Turner Network Television.
   Almost six months later, the project has no script, no director,
no shooting schedule and no casting outside of Ross.
   Dolly Parton's Sandollar company is planning a $20 million
feature film covering one year in Baker's life. The project will be
directed by Hugh Hudson, whose 1981 ``Chariots of Fire'' won the
Oscar for Best Picture. But this big-screen version has no finished
script and no release date.
   Although the latter two versions are far behind HBO's ambitious
schedule, make no mistake about the intent of all three filmmakers.
Not one has considered shelving the product. And all claim theirs
is the best.
   HBO cites the mammoth scope of its film, which covered Baker's
life from age 19 to 68, employed 6,000 extras and shot for nine
weeks on 100 locations in Hungary. It is produced by David Puttnam
and directed by Brian Gibson, who also made the Emmy-winning
``Murderers Among Us: The Simon Wisenthal Story'' for HBO.
   For now, Turner is content to hang all project credibility on
Ross's involvement. ``Until we have a wonderful script, we really
just have to bank on Diana, and I think she's pretty bankable,''
said Linda Berman, TNT's head of development.
   Howard Rosenman, one of five co-producers on the big-screen
Sandollar version, said he doesn't take the cable movies seriously.
   ``There's no challenge between the director of `Chariots of
Fire' and the guy who did `The Simon Wisenthal Story,' '' Rosenman
said.
   If most Americans were scandalized by Baker in the early part of
this century, few today know the enormity or impact of her life
abroad.
   Her infamous banana dance, in which she appeared naked save for
a belt of fake bananas, became the trademark of European revues.
She did more, however, than sing and dance in the nude.
   Baker was a tireless advocate of civil rights. In World War II,
she was a spy for the French resistance, carrying intelligence
information about German troop concentrations scrawled in invisible
ink on her sheet music.
   It was a long way from St. Louis, where as a child, she lived in
an abandoned railroad car.
   As a young woman in the early 1920s, Baker wanted to be famous.
Americans wanted her to scrub their floors. She fled to Paris,
where color was less a discriminatory factor.
   At the height of her Paris glory, she returned to New York and
appeared in the 1936 Ziegfeld Follies with Fanny Brice and Bob
Hope. But the American public still was not ready for Baker.
Critics panned her in racist reviews.
   Humiliated, she returned to Europe. In the 1950s, her body
ravaged by numerous surgeries that left her sterile, she adopted 12
children from around the world, calling them her ``Rainbow Tribe.''
   Tragedy, illness and several marriages took their toll. Once the
richest black person in the world, Baker was destitute shortly
before her death.
   She died in her sleep on the second night of a phenomenally
successful comeback show in Paris.
   ``It's a classic story,'' said Robert Cooper, senior vice
president of HBO pictures. ``The first thing I asked was `If this
is true, why hasn't it been told?' ''
   The reason?
   ``I think people just didn't know how to do it,'' he said.
   Why now?
   ``Once one person decides to do it, it forces everyone else to
finalize their plans,'' Cooper said. ``I think he who comes out
first has a big advantage.''

<HEAD>Forest Whitaker: Man of Many Parts Appearing in HBO Movie</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A burly, good-natured Texan, soft-spoken and a
little shy, Forest Whitaker doesn't exactly stand out in a crowd.
   But in Hollywood, where unemployment is the rule, not the
exception, he does OK.
   Whitaker has been one of the kids in ``Fast Times at Ridgemont
High,'' the dude who pool-hustled Paul Newman in ``The Color of
Money,'' a rock-steady ``Platoon'' grunt, and Robin Williams'
sidekick in ``Good Morning, Vietnam.''
   Two years ago, he got a best-actor award at the Cannes Film
Festival as the tortured modern jazz pioneer Charlie Parker in
Clint Eastwood's ``Bird.''
   There was no Oscar nomination, but many good reviews, which
tided him over.
   ``I guess the reward is to be appreciated for your work,''
Whitaker says.
   On Saturday, he's in a Home Box Office movie, ``Criminal
Justice,'' as a fundamentally decent ex-con trying to stay straight
but wrongly accused of slashing and robbing a crack-addicted
prostitute in Brooklyn.
   It is a horrifying trip through what singer Tom Waits once
called ``the bowels of due process.'' Whitaker, a methodical man,
researched it before and while making the film in Pittsburgh five
months ago.
   He hung out in the courts and in prison, observing, listening to
prisoners talking with their families, trying to make bail. He even
did a little time behind bars, he said, trying to get the moves,
the look right.
   A lot of prisoners didn't know who he was. Those who did, he
said, would say things like, ``Well, what are YOU doing here? What
did YOU do?''
   But it was similar in a way, he said, to the time he hung out
with people in the medical profession, taking notes for the plastic
surgeon he played in the film ``Johnny Handsome.''
   ``The people are sometimes pretty helpful,'' he said. ``Because
they want their stories to be told properly.''
   Whitaker has been lucky enough to work fairly often since ``Fast
Times'' in 1982.
   He once planned to sing opera, but switched to theater while in
college. But his musical background has helped, notably in ``Bird.''
   He didn't actually play the alto sax heard in the film, but he
learned enough to fake it, then to get sounds from it, and then ...
music.
   But until recently, he hadn't touched the horn. The reason: He
was too deeply affected by what he'd gone through portraying
Parker, a junkie genius who died in 1955 at age 34.
   ``When I played the horn, it reminded me of a lot of emotions
that I was dealing with when I played the part,'' said Whitaker.
``So I avoided playing for a while. ... It took a while to wash it
off, to get rid of it.''
   The actor also has been having a go at writing, putting together
his first screenplay, ``Pick a Card,'' over the course of seven
years. It's a comedy about a con man and a three-card monte dealer
who works the streets.
   There's no deal for that yet, and none is imminent, he said.
   Two weeks after making ``Criminal Justice,'' he proceeded to yet
another new role, this one in a film comedy, ``Rage in Harlem.'' In
that one, due out next year, he co-stars with Danny Glover and
Gregory Hines, playing a mortician's accountant.
   He also, at 29, is making his debut as a co-producer, having
served in that capacity on ``Rage.'' He laughed when asked if
Whitaker the actor ever argued with Whitaker the producer.
   No, he said, but he's now a bit more sympathetic to producers.
   ``They have to think about stuff I never would think about
before,'' he said, ``things I would just ignore and say, `Well, I'm
an actor.' ''
   He knows that for an actor to be sympathetic towards producers
constitutes heresy in some quarters.
   ``Yeah, but they have a pretty difficult job sometimes,'' he
said. ``But as long as you're working toward the same goal, it
works out.''

<HEAD>ANOTHER LOOK: White Supremacist Posse Comitatus Fades Into History</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT IMRIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TIGERTON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delbert Larson scanned the empty woods
where the Posse Comitatus once envisioned a paramilitary settlement
for white supremacists, a haven from government regulations and
taxes.
   ``Americans are blind and deaf,'' he says, explaining why the
settlement failed. ``We tried to do what we thought was a job to
alert the people.''
   Larson, 66, is one of the few remnants of the Posse. Just a
decade ago, they trained with guns, built underground shelters,
vowed to rebel against government and caused a stir in this tiny
central Wisconsin town.
   He now lives alone in a makeshift home on the rolling
countryside just east of Tigerton, a white-haired man with steely
blue eyes who cuts wood for heat and reads the Bible for spiritual
comfort.
   Most of the Posse's militant leaders, including flamboyant
businessman James Wickstrom and Tigerton farmer Donald
Minniecheske, are sitting in prison after a government crackdown in
the mid-1980s.
   Townsfolk have pronounced the Posse dead since 1985, when
officers swooped onto the hundreds of acres of property the group
had assembled and removed some trailer homes that violated county
zoning laws.
   But Shawano County District Attorney Gary R. Bruno isn't
convinced.
   Some evidence indicates hate groups in the United States are
becoming ``bigger and badder,'' Bruno said, adding the Posse
epitomized such groups with its loathing of Jews, blacks, taxes and
government.
   The group's activities petered out in Wisconsin because the
leaders were silenced, the prosecutor said.
   ``You cut off the head of a snake and the rest of the snake can
worm around, but it can't bite you anymore,'' he said.
   The government considered the Posse dangerous lawbreakers,
hatemongers and potential killers, something akin to organized
crime. At least six Posse members have been convicted of crimes
ranging from theft to tax evasion.
   Wickstrom, 47, was sentenced Aug. 7 in Pennsylvania to 38 months
in prison for conspiring to distribute $100,000 in counterfeit
money. He left Wisconsin in 1985 shortly after serving 13 months
for impersonating a municipal official in the Posse's self-created
Township of Tigerton Dells.
   Minniecheske, 56, upon whose farm land the Posse's compound was
to flourish, is serving a nine-year prison sentence in Wisconsin
for destruction of property, possession of stolen property and
transfer of stolen property.
   Gordon Kahl, a North Dakota tax protester linked to the Posse,
was killed June 3, 1983, during the second of two shootouts with
police seeking to arrest him for tax evasion. Those shootouts left
three federal marshals dead.
   Residents link the origins of the Posse to a day in the late
1970s when Minniecheske dumped two loads of sand along a river for
a swimming beach, said Tigerton Police Chief Charles Gehrman. State
officials objected _ he had no permit _ and his outrage against the
government interference fueled a movement.
   Some residents said the Posse had legitimate complaints about
government, but the wrong approach to solving them.
   ``They had support until they started going crazy with stuff,
when they started flashing those guns,'' said Kevin Maas, a logger
who remembers seeing at least one Posse member in town with a
pistol strapped to his hip.
   The Tigerton Dells Bar and Ranch _ the Posse's headquarters and
home for the Minniecheske family _ still displays a large picture
of the late U.S. Sen. Joseph McCarthy, the anti-Communist crusader
of the 1950s.
   ``That's been here since 1964,'' Minniecheske's wife, Sally,
explained. ``He was a good friend of Donald's dad.''
   Up the road, the driveway to the former Posse compound is marked
with ominous signs _ ``Private Property,'' ``No Trespassing,''
``Keep Out.''
   A mailbox labeled ``Life Science Church; Christian Liberty
Academy'' provides the only hint of the church building that once
nestled in the trees. The government has alleged the church was
nothing more than a front used by the group to evade taxes.
   Relatives visit Donald Minniecheske twice a week in prison.
   ``I don't think they have broken him. Not at all,'' said
Minniecheske's son, James. ``Prison will never change him.''
   Meanwhile, his wife, children and grandchildren host the church
in their tavern. ``We survive,'' Mrs. Minniecheske said, shrugging
her shoulders. ``The church takes care of what we need.''
   Mrs. Minniecheske estimated 30 to 40 Posse members still live in
the Tigerton area, farming and sharing financial resources. The
government, however, is seeking to foreclose their property for
back taxes.
   Jeremy Erickson, 13, one of Mrs. Minniecheske's 19
grandchildren, remembers the military maneuvers and survival
training at the compound.
   ``When the Posse was here, it was kind of fun,'' the boy said.
   ``These guys used to line up, in camouflage, and shoot their
guns in the river. They really didn't scare us. All of them were
pretty nice. They didn't want to hurt anybody. They were all
against the government because our government is corrupt,'' he said.
   James Minniecheske, 33, wonders whether the Posse should be
revived.
   ``If it keeps my kids free from all this tyranny, let's do it,''
he said.
   But the jailing of Posse leaders ``scares people from trying to
do anything,'' he said. ``I think guns are the only way to get our
freedoms back.''

   The venerable Yiddish newspaper Forward, tutor
and friend to generations of immigrants, is taking a giant step out
of the Lower East Side with a national, English-language weekly.
   Faced with diminishing readership of its Yiddish edition, the
93-year-old Forward is braving a depressed newspaper market and
ignoring widespread opinion that there is no need for a national
Jewish newspaper.
   Its owners are confident they've located a niche among their
competition, and believe their publishing legacy will give them the
powerful boost needed to succeed.
   ``Yiddish readers are very loyal and have an emotional tie with
the paper historically,'' said Harold Ostroff, co-chairman of
Forward Publishing Co. ``They feel it's a part of the family, in a
sense.''
   The Forward traces its heritage back to 1897 when it emerged
from the socialist labor movement to take up the cudgel of the
Yiddish-speaking working class.
   The paper, initially a daily, served as teacher, political
advocate, spiritual guide and psychiatrist for its readers, mostly
Jewish immigrants to the United States. It published everything
from a famous advice column _ ``A Bintel Brief,'' a bundle of
letters _ to the writings of Isaac Bashevis Singer. During the
early part of the century, its readers numbered more than 250,000.
But as the immigrants were assimilated into American society, the
number of Yiddish speakers declined and so did the newspaper's
circulation.
   The paper went weekly in 1983 and began to publish an
English-language supplement. Its circulation is now about 17,000.
   Recognizing the need to shore up its readership and attract
descendants of readers past, the publishers have expanded the
English-language insert into a paper in its own right.
   The first few issues of the paper, which was first published May
25, were distributed in the New York area only. National
circulation will begin Friday, with a projected circulation of
30,000.
   Like the Yiddish Forward, the new paper combines news with
social and cultural commentary. About 40 percent of the paper will
be hard news and analysis, 40 percent cultural coverage and
fiction, and 20 percent editorial pages, said Seth Lipsky, editor
of the Forward and president of Forward Publishing Co.
   But Lipsky said he realizes that reputation alone will not carry
the fledgling paper.
   The Yiddish paper already has a deficit, so the papers will
share material, along with circulation and advertising programs in
some markets, to ease costs.
   The Forward is entering a specialized market in which more than
100 Jewish publications are jostling for position. The toughest
challenge among them will come from the regional Jewish presses.
New York City, where Lipsky expects half of his circulation, has
three established weeklies.
   Lipsky, though, believes there is room for his publication in
each of the nation's major cities. His niche, he said, is in
providing international and national Jewish news coverage beyond
what the larger metropolitan dailies and regional Jewish papers
offer.
   His paper already has opened bureaus in Jerusalem, Moscow,
Paris, Washington and New York, and will supplement the offices
with stringers, freelancers and news wire services. There are plans
to open bureaus in other cities, including Miami, Chicago and Los
Angeles.
   Lipsky believes there are enough major Jewish stories now to
launch a paper. He cites the rise of a anti-Semitic movement in the
Soviet Union, the prevailing conflict in Israel and the
democratization of Eastern Europe.
   But Jewish editors around the country and observers of the
Jewish press are less certain it will find a market.
   ``I have a philosophy that our readership is much more
interested in the news of the local Jewish community than in news
of the international Jewish community,'' said Marc Klein, editor
and publisher of the Northern California Jewish Bulletin, which has
a circulation of about 27,000.
   Klein, who also is president of the American Jewish Press
Association, said 70 percent to 80 percent of his paper is devoted
to local stories.
   Gary Rosenblatt, editor of the Baltimore Jewish Times, agrees.
   ``In Baltimore, they want to know from who's getting married to
who's having a bar mitzvah to more weightier issues,'' said
Rosenblatt, whose paper has a circulation of about 20,000.
   Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation
League and a self-described ``news junkie,'' believes the Forward's
association with the Yiddish Forward will at least draw attention
to the new paper.
   ``The name `Forward' has history, has meaning in Anglo-Jewish
life,'' he said.
   The national paper won't survive on Forward's readers, he said,
``But there is a nostalgic element. Jews feel sensitive to
tradition and continuity and history. That will help the Forward
initially.''

<HEAD>Dolphin Deaths May Be Caused by Viral Epidemic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCISCO CONDE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dead dolphins are washing up on Spain's
eastern Mediterranean coast in unusually high numbers, causing
marine biologists and ecologists to suspect a viral epidemic is
killing them.
   Many scientists and environmental activists believe the deaths
are the inevitable outcome of large-scale dumping of toxic
pollutants in the Mediterranean by petrochemical plants.
   Esteve Grau, a University of Barcelona biologist, said
preliminary results of autopsies on three of the dead mammals
showed extremely high levels of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs.
   ``We're working on the hypothesis that the dolphins ate
PCB-contaminated fish and that this severely weakened their immune
systems, making them susceptible to a still-unidentified virus,''
Grau said in a telephone interview.
   PCBs are liquid, resinous or crystalline organic compounds used
in industrial processes as lubricants, heat-transfer fluids or to
give strength or flexibility to wood, metal or concrete.
   ``We believe the scientists' hypothesis to be correct,'' said
Xavier Pastor, head of the Greenpeace environmental group's office
in Palma, capital of the Spanish island of Majorca in the
Mediterranean.
   He said the toxicity of PCBs and their resistance to
decomposition make them especially dangerous to mammals.
   ``The epidemic appears similar to others that killed up to 800
seals in the North Sea off the Netherlands in 1988 and in another
case under study in California,'' Pastor said.
   He said some of the dead dolphins had been found on beaches near
Palma, in the Balearic archipelago 150 miles south of Barcelona.
   Grau and other scientists from the Barcelona Zoo, the Marineland
Aquatic Park and the University of Valencia have conducted 10
autopsies on dolphins. They are trying to determine why only
striped dolphin, and not fish, have been killed, he said.
   Dr. Joaquim Piza of Marineland said doubts remained about
whether PCBs caused the dolphins to die.
   ``If that were the case, it's most likely dolphins of other
species would have been affected,'' he said in a telephone
interview.
   ``The autopsies have not produced conclusive evidence that the
PCBs are the cause. The only thing we have been able to determine
so far with certainty is that the dolphins suffered a weakening of
their immune systems.''
   Piza said there was some speculation the dolphins had contracted
a herpes-type virus that attacked their immune systems.
   Between 12 and 20 infirm or aged striped dolphins are found
washed up every summer on Spain's eastern beaches and on Majorca,
Grau said, but there have been more than 100 this year. He said the
striped dolphin is not an endangered species and is abundant in the
Mediterranean.
   Scientists fear the presence of PCBs eventually may reduce the
number of dolphins by affecting reproduction in addition to killing
the weaker ones, Grau said.
   ``We estimate that only 1 percent of affected dolphins have
washed up,'' he said, ``which means the total number that have
succumbed to the viral epidemic could be as high as 10,000.''
   Pastor noted that industrial and chemical companies continue
dumping tons of toxic waste, including PCBs, into the Mediterranean
from plants along Spain's Mediterranean coast from Barcelona to
Algeciras, adjacent to Gibraltar.
   ``We've called on Spain's autonomous regional governments and
the central government in Madrid to set up a plan to gradually, but
definitively, end all industrial toxic waste dumping into the
Mediterranean by the end of 1991,'' he said.
   ``We've tried to work with industrial companies directly, but
they have refused to acknowledge how much they dump into the
Mediterranean, saying it might reveal industrial secrets to
competitors.''
   He said Greenpeace had found it difficult to develop estimates
of the amount of PCBs companies in Spain dump into the
Mediterranean.

War

   When Capt. Francisco Mena deserted
the army and joined El Salvador's guerrillas, they greeted him with
tentative embraces, hard stares and skepticism.
   For a year, a veteran fighter known as Fredy never let Mena walk
behind him.
   ``There was a ceremony that was a bit awkward,'' Mena, who
changed sides in 1981, told an interviewer. ``I gave a talk and
afterward the guerrillas began asking questions.''
   Some of those questions, he said, were: ``Why did you stay so
long in the army? How many operations did you take part in? How
many of us have you killed?
   `` `Damn,' I thought. `What have I gotten myself into? Here I
came to help these guys, and they're busting my chops','' Mena said.
   He smiled at the recollection and brushed one hand through his
wavy black hair. The 47-year-old rebel commander was in the
delegation that, on Aug. 22, ended a fruitless round of peace talks
here with the government of Alfredo Cristiani, the Salvadoran
president.
   A nearly 11-year-old civil war between the leftist Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front and a succession of U.S.-backed
governments has killed an estimated 72,000 people, most of them
civilians.
   The trip to Costa Rica was Mena's first involvement in the
monthly negotiations and his first respite from the fighting in
years.
   He was included because the exclusive subject of the talks this
month was a rebel demand that the armed forces be purged of corrupt
officers and reformed. That issue is the main sticking point in the
negotations.
   Col. Mauricio Vargas, as a member of the government delegation,
protects the military's interests at the talks.
   Officially, the Salvadoran military holds Mena in contempt. In
the words of Col. Orlando Zepeda, vice minister of defense: ``That
traitor and murderer has no moral right to make accusations or
demands on us.''
   Classmates at the military and some other officers, however,
have demonstrated a camaraderie with Mena that could help promote
eventual accord.
   Lt. Col. Mauricio Duke shook hands and chatted amiably with
Mena, his former superior, when they met in the lobby of the hotel
where the talks were held.
   Mena gave a copy of his book, ``From the National Army to the
Guerrilla Army,'' to Duke, who responded with a sly smile:
``Gracias, my captain.''
   The copy, like another sent to Vargas, was inscribed: ``Let's
not forget the 15th of October.''
   That is the date in 1979 when young officers _ Vargas, Mena and
Duke included _ overthrew the rightist dictatorship of Gen. Carlos
Humberto Romero.
   A broad-based government whose objective was national
reconciliation resulted, but a purge of the military old guard
faltered. Repression and death squads followed, and the result was
civil war.
   Mena traces his change of heart to a year as an officer of the
National Guard, a militarized police force.
   He described counterinsurgency tactics that included torture,
rape and murder of alleged leftists, and told of an initiation rite
during which he declined an invitation to drive a bayonet through
the heart of a suspect.
   While he pondered such brutality later in his air-conditioned
office, Mena said, the suspect and 11 others were killed in the
gymnasium of the National Guard headquarters.
   ``That kind of thing consolidated my change of thinking by
making me profoundly question the role we military men were
playing,'' he said. ``It became denigrating for me to wear the
National Guard insignia.''
   The proclamation issued by those who carried out the 1979 coup
promised respect for human rights, an end to corruption and
modernization of a semifeudal economy that left most Salvadorans
destitute.
   Peace is possible if military authorities honor those goals,
Mena said, but added: ``The picture is this: We're getting nowhere
in negotiations, so let's have at it with the irons.''
   Fredy, the guerrilla fighter so wary of Mena, was killed in
combat in 1985.
   Just before he died, Mena said, they had a conversation in which
Fredy told him:
   ``In those early days I didn't trust you a bit, like you were
still the enemy. Who ever would have believed that we'd come to be
like brothers, that I'd gladly give my life for you?''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ More and more, women are having their first
child after their 40th birthday and new studies indicate that is
not as risky as it once was thought to be. For one thing, today's
woman is in better shape; dieting and aerobics have paid off, and
Life Begins at 40 has become literally true.

   Pat Packer met Ross Williams when she was 38 and
married him three years later. Even as they said their vows, the
bride could hear her biological clock ticking. ``As soon as I left
the altar, I knew it was time to start making a kid.''
   Now 47, Packer-Williams, a graphic designer in Winchester,
Mass., is the mother of 4-year-old Gavin and 17-month-old Colin, a
situation that confounds financial planners.
   ``They're used to helping people plan for either retirement or
college tuition. You never hear about plans for people with both.''
   Financial planners take note: Packer-Williams represents a small
but growing group of women who are pushing nature's envelope,
delaying motherhood until after their 40th birthdays.
   These women aren't pioneers, though the over-40 phenomenon is
undergoing a revival. What's new is a more optimistic outlook for
late-in-life pregnancies, the result of encouraging research.
   A study in the New England Journal of Medicine in March showed
no evidence that advanced age reduces a healthy woman's chances of
delivering a healthy baby. The Mount Sinai School of Medicine
researchers cautioned that their findings may not apply to women
over 40, too small a group to yield reliable data. But an
accompanying editorial called the message ``clear and optimistic.''
   ``The bottom line of the papers is that people today are in much
better shape, and that changes the whole concept of being
pregnant,'' says Dr. Manuel Alvarez, assistant professor of
obstetrics and gynecology at Mount Sinai.
   Role models abound. Actresses Bette Midler, Glenn Close, Ursula
Andress, Vanessa Redgrave and Jane Seymour all gave birth to
healthy first babies after 40. Patti LuPone, 41-year-old star of
the ABC series ``Life Goes On,'' is expecting her first child in
November. And CBS recently announced it would scale back ``Face to
Face With Connie Chung'' this fall to accommodate the 44-year-old
newswoman's efforts to have a baby.
   ``After consulting with my doctors, I became convinced that to
make this effort, I now need to take a very aggressive approach to
having a baby,'' she said in a statement.
   Should she succeed, Chung will join a tiny sorority. First
births to women over 40 accounted for just 6,909 of the 3.9 million
babies born in America during 1988.
   They have much in common, these predominantly white,
middle-class, college-educated urban professionals. They often
marry later if at all, putting off family for career, and as a
result, sandwich themselves between aging parents and young
children.
   Years of dieting and aerobics have paid off. ``I think of myself
as indomitable,'' says Tina Walton-Virta, 43, mother of
15-month-old Olivia. But like most older mothers, she is ever
mindful of the realities. ``It's very sad when I think about not
being able to participate in her life for as long as I'd like.''
   For now, the biggest problem is postpartum exhaustion. ``It's
not having a baby at 45, it's having a 2-year-old at 47,'' says
Polly Ham, a teacher and potter on Lopez Island, Wash.
   Women over 40 have been having first babies for years. In each
of the years from 1950 to 1955, more women over 40 gave birth for
the first time than did so during 1987, the Census Bureau reports.
   Between 1970 and 1986, the rate of first births increased by 50
percent for women 40 to 44, a natural progression of the growing
numbers of career women over 35 who began having babies more than a
decade ago.
   ``At 30, my cutoff was 35. At 35, my cutoff was 40. When you
really want to have a child, you just keep moving the cutoff point
later,'' says Ham.
   At 45, she gave birth to Laurel. Like Walton-Virta and
Packer-Williams, Ham is married to a man nine years her junior.
   ``It's almost like watching evolution in progress, the way
nature accommodates these lifestyle changes,'' says New York
obstetrician Jonathan Scher. First-time mothers over 40 constitute
20 percent of his practice, a fivefold increase from a decade ago.
   That isn't to say the next trend will be motherhood after 50.
``We will reach a biological limit, and we are getting close to
it,'' says Dr. Siegfried Rotmensch, a high-risk specialist at
Yale-New Haven Hospital in Connecticut.
   For the time being, the pattern is apt to continue. In a 1989
Census Bureau survey, more than half of childless married women 30
to 34 said they still planned to have babies.
   Not all will get their wish. One in six of all couples is
infertile, and fertility decreases with age, Rotmensch says. About
90 percent of 25-year-old women not using birth control will get
pregnant within a year. At 40, that figure drops to 30 percent.
   Today's infertility specialists have more to offer women unable
to conceive on their own, but the conception rate among
artificially inseminated women also declines with age. In vitro
fertilization has proven less successful in older women as well.
   Mary Ellen Conway, an art therapist in a Boston suburb, spent
two years undergoing infertility treatment before giving up. ``I
had completely resigned myself to not having a child, and under the
circumstances, was adjusting very well.''
   Now she's adjusting to 4-month-old Jacob, the baby she
inexplicably conceived at 43. After so many years without children,
parenthood takes considerable getting used to, says Steven Shade,
the 37-year-old artist Conway married nine years ago.
   ``The downside is that we had really developed a certain
lifestyle for ourselves _ that and the fact I don't have as much
patience as I'd like.'' Fortunately, there's also an upside: ``My
son is a genius,'' he says.
   Infertility isn't the only reason doctors advise older women not
to wait too long.
   The incidence of Down's syndrome, 1.5 per thousand among women
of 31, jumps to 1 in 350 at age 35, 1 in 100 at age 40 and 1 in 30
at age 45.
   Prenatal testing, recommended for all women over 35, can now be
done earlier and with less risk to the fetus. The most common
procedure is amniocentesis, in which amniotic fluid is withdrawn by
syringe from the uterus. Cells are isolated, grown in a laboratory
and analyzed to determine the number of chromosomes in the fetus.
An extra chromosome 21 indicates Down's syndrome.
   Once performed 18 weeks into pregnancy, amniocentesis can now be
done at 13 or 14 weeks. ``A pregnancy won't show before 20 weeks,
and the woman won't feel it before 18-20 weeks, so early amnio
helps avoid a lot of issues,'' says Dr. Steven Swersky, a high-risk
obstetrician in New York.

   The New England Journal of Medicine editorial stressed that the
few pregnancy-related problems more common among older women, such
as high blood pressure or diabetes, ``are readily manageable in
1990.''
   In the past, such problems may have been overstated, Swersky
says. ``Risks do go up, but in some cases, they go from 3 to 3.1. A
lot depends on how it's reported.''
   A lot also depends on who's being studied. The Mount Sinai
findings were based on private patients who were predominantly
white, married, college-educated non-smokers _ precisely the group
most apt to delay childbearing.
   The good news has yet to find its way into some doctors'
offices. ``In today's medical-legal climate, a woman of 39 can go
in with a dream and come out feeling like a time bomb that's
waiting to go off,'' Swersky says.
   ``Senior people in the field still have certain attitudes.
Doctors have been bombarded with such negativism for so long.''
   Attitudes are changing _ but slowly.
   Kate, a 50-year-old New York writer who asks that her last name
not be used, wanted natural delivery in a birthing room. Instead,
like more than 50 percent of pregnant women over 40, she wound up
with a Caesarean section.
   Such surgery is not always warranted, doctors say.
   ``You're taught that these are `premium' pregnancies, so doctors
tend to bail out and do C-sections sooner in these patients,'' says
Dr. John Elliott of Phoenix Perinatal Associates, the nation's
largest private practice of high-risk obstetrics.
   ``Some physicians tell women just because they're older that
they're fragile and need special handling. That attitude really
bothers me. All of a sudden, this woman who thought this was the
neatest thing in the world has had all the fun taken out of it.''
   For some older women, the fun is already diluted by anxiety.
``Particularly if she's had problems with infertility or previous
miscarriages, a woman may have tremendous fear of losing her
baby,'' says Patricia Schreiner-Engel, associate professor of
ob-gyn and reproductive science and psychiatry at Mount Sinai.
   While many pregnant women worry about losing their babies, older
women's fears often are heightened by the likelihood they won't get
another chance _ a situation that also can create anxious,
overprotective parents, she says.
   On a brighter note, ``many older people see themselves as better
parents, and I think it's true. Most of us would make better
parents when we're older and have less pressure in our lives.''
   Women who come late to the baby business often find motherhood a
great leveler. ``My grooming is slipping _ there just isn't time,''
Packer-Williams says. ``I used to look at mothers and say, `Look at
her. Why can't she get herself together?' Now I know.''
   Walton-Virta, who lives in Brooklyn, N.Y., spent her 20s and 30s
living abroad and indulging her love of adventures. So far, raising
Olivia is on a par with the best of them, she says.
   ``All the normal things I associated with being a mother, like
Little League, pediatricians and station wagons, I thought would
disgust me. I thought, what a boring way to live. I was wrong about
what happens when you fall in love with a baby.''
   Of course, motherhood after 40 is not without trade-offs.
   An only child, Packer-Williams finds herself too busy to pay
much attention to her own elderly mother and father. ``I'm really
caught in the aging parent-baby sandwich,'' she says. ``Not to
mention, I'd like younger grandparents.''
   There's also one's own mortality to consider.
   ``You do worry. It's a reality, and you don't ignore it,'' says
Neen Hunt, 49, head of the Calhoun School in New York. Hunt, the
mother of Evan, 10 and Richard, 6, lost her own mother at 50.
``We've talked about new moms and dads. My kids are more attuned to
that possibility.''
   Polly Ham's brother and sister both died young. Her husband lost
his mother when he was 14. ``There are moments when he has concerns
about my being older,'' she says, ``but I have to trust the wisdom
of the universe that somehow Laurel came into my life at the right
time.'' She says her daughter is a great incentive to stay healthy.
   Classic comedy routines can take on new twists when hard-bitten
professionals meet Dr. Spock.
   Unexpectedly pregnant at 42, Sally Anderson, a college science
textbook editor in New York, didn't worry about telling her parents
or husband, children's book illustrator Fred Winkowski.
   She worried about telling her boss.
   ``I had been so devoted to my job. When I finally broke the
news, I had tears in my eyes and my upper lip was shaking. Would I
be demoted? Would I lose my window office?
   ``My boss said, `How did this happen?' I said, `I don't know.'
And he said, `You're a biologist, Sally. Of course you know.' ''
   Erik Winkowski, who has his mother's Scandinavian cheekbones and
straight, silky hair, turned 7 in June. At an age when most women
are spoiling their children's children, Sally remains on the front
lines of motherhood, a 50-year-old Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle
expert who speaks fluent Nintendo.
   ``He's such a treasure. I think I look at him differently than I
would have at 28, but it's so arrogant to say so,'' she says. ``Who
am I to say that a 28-year-old wouldn't love her child as much?''
   Occasionally, she caught herself doing mental arithmetic. ``I
told a friend just after Erik was born that when Erik is my age,
I'll be almost 90. There was a brief pause, then we both started
laughing.''
   Anderson has no regrets. Younger friends who left lower-level
jobs to have babies found their career derailed, she says. ``Being
where I wanted to be in terms of my career has made a big
difference.''
   By contrast, Kate has neither a stable career nor a husband to
help support and rear 2-year-old James, the son she delivered at
age 47. Her partner, a man in his 50s with grown children, walked
out when she refused to terminate the pregnancy she had thought
they both wanted.
   As a single parent, Kate finds it doubly hard being so out of
sync with her peers. A friend's child is about to get married; hers
is learning to speak in complete sentences.
   ``I read the books written for older mothers, the ones that
assume you have your life all pulled together, and I just laugh. I
am so up against it financially, I'm living from week to week.''
   Last winter, unable to afford child care, she left her baby with
her 82-year-old parents in Florida while she commuted to work in
New York. ``At one point, I was away from him 2{ weeks. It was
hell.''
   Given the hardships, is she sorry?
   ``I thank the Lord, the stars, the universe and all of the
angels. It is a miracle,'' she says, ``and I'm grateful.''

   Scores of correspondents have died on the battlefields,
including Pyle in World War II. He covered the war for the
Scripps-Howard Newspaper Alliance. Boyle, who covered World War II,
Korea and Vietnam for The Associated Press, died in 1974.
   Arnett, who covered Vietnam for more than a decade for The
Associated Press, now is a correspondent with CNN based in
Jerusalem.
   ``The old war correspondent has become extinct because old wars
have become extinct,'' says Arnett. ``Just as you won't have grunts
unshaven on the front line worrying about home and dug in for six
months, you don't need reporters there because you're not going to
have them six months . . . What has made the war correspondent of
old sort of redundant is that the modern Western wars are of very
short duration, like Panama.''
   The Panama invasion was basically reported by journalists
permanently stationed in the area.
   Arnett was on the Panama invasion within 24 hours. The military
pool was restricted. ``By the time most of the correspondents got
there, basically the shooting was over. Even though we did go out
with the troops, there was nothing to cover. Grenada was the same
way.''
   Those thoughts stir different sorts of memories and I see my
friend and colleague Arnett dug in at the big Vietnam battles, on
patrol alongside American troops, marching along a foreboding dirt
road in the rain and mud, in harm's way, steel helmet protecting
his head, a poncho wrapped around his body.
   Or another sidekick, Dickey Chapelle, dressed in her jungle
fatigues, a bush hat hiding her horn-rimmed glasses, a field pack
strapped to her back crammed with cameras, film and a tape recorder.
   One November day 25 years ago, she challenged Henri Huet, an AP
photographer, to a bet. She wagered a dime that the Marine unit she
was with would be fired on before his.
   She lost by half an hour when Henri's unit was pinned down by
sniper fire. ``Okay,'' she laughed. ``Tomorrow I'll have my
chance.''
   That night, Henri helped her dig her foxhole despite her
protests. Night was coming on fast and a mortar attack was
expected, although it did not materialize.
   The next morning she and Henri shared a breakfast of C-rations.
Then, as she did almost every day, she moved out with the Marines
to begin the day's patrolling. At the foot of the first hill they
went down, a booby-trapped Viet Cong grenade wired to a mortar tore
through the patrol.
   Henri, who had lingered in the rear to take other photos, heard
the cries, ``Corpsman! Corpsman!'' With his heart racing, he ran
100 yards to where four bodies lay on the ground. One face was down
and soaked with blood. Henri couldn't tell who it was. He moved
closer.
   It was Dickey Chapelle.
   Dickey Chapelle, 47, an accomplished pilot and parachutist,
veteran war correspondent and author. She had covered World War II
and virtually every trouble spot since. She was jailed by the
Communists during the Hungarian revolution. She bled to death on
the floor of a helicopter as it carried her to a field hospital.
   Ironically, Henri Huet would die six years later, along with the
fabled Life photographer Larry Burrows and UPI photo editor Kent
Potter, while covering a South Vietnamese operation.
   Their helicopter was hit by North Vietnamese fire and burst into
a fireball. The South Vietnamese pilot, either because of
inexperience or disorientation, flew over that same gun position,
not once, but twice. The second time they got him.
   In World War II, Korea and Vietnam, correspondents flew to the
front in helicopters and rode to the battlefields in jeeps, cars
and even sampans in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam. In Vietnam we
hitchhiked back by land, air and sea from the remote jungles and
hills to our Saigon headquarters to file our dispatches. Indeed,
television had to ship its film by air to Tokyo, Hong Kong or some
other destination for relay to the United States.
   There was, of course, no regular transportation. I got many a
ride by running up and down runways waving my arms at the pilots,
begging, ``Can you give me a lift to Saigon?''
   The first was the toughest for me. I found myself crouched in a
bucket seat, drained and exhausted, boxed into a windowless C130
cargo plane as it took off in the darkness. In the freight
compartment with me were perhaps 200 other Americans.
   But I was the only one alive. All the others were wrapped in
green plastic body bags, slain that day in swamps and jungles half
a world from home.
   As the plane droned through the night skies, I tried to keep my
sanity by working on my notes. But I soon was overwhelmed by the
thought of the grief that would come when the families of these
young men answered the dreaded knock on the door.
   But there is the other and brighter side to the new situation of
war coverage: that we will not again mourn as frequently as we did
in the past the deaths of journalistic comrades in arms or be the
bearer of dreadful news to American families.

hotel nearby in a joint venture with Indian investors.
   Each morning, busloads of Americans, Germans and Japanese clog
the mud lanes running past monuments that have astonished visitors
for centuries.
   Ancient Samarkand sits in moldering glory at the center of the
modern Soviet urban blur that spreads from its edges. Its main
plaza is a dramatic square of arches and domes in rich colors.
   Tamarlane, the master builder and tyrant, lies blocks away under
a gracefully shaped, fluted cupola tiled in the deep blue and gold
hues that were his trademark.
   Across town, a complex of blue-domed mausoleums line a sunken
alley 100 yards long, each elaborately inlaid with ceramic mosaics,
semi-precious stones and hardwoods.
   The old market sprawls from the magnificent ruins of the Bibi
Khanum mosque to the outdoor teahouse where old men spend the day
chatting and picking their toes.
   Many visitors find it as exciting to watch the people as the
architecture.
   Men, Moslems and Jews alike, favor a white-embroidered black
square skullcap. Robe styles date back to the first draft of the
Bible. But there are also calf roper's baseball caps, faded
designer jeans and Mickey Mouse T-shirts.
   Most women dress to tradition, in cape-like shifts of cotton or
silk in vivid patterns. Baggy pants reach below the ankles. Some
women, mostly Russians, venture out with low necklines and high
hems.
   All styles and colors blend in the market, a dusty sprawl of
ancient brick, tin roofing and rickety stalls. Men doze at tables
laden with spices. Women hawk fat red strawberries, mysterious
grains and the Uzbeks' distinctive wheels of tasty flat bread.
   Samarkand is rich in legendary hospitality. On winding back
streets, families make room at dinner tables, even wedding parties,
for tourists who stop to show interest.
   In fact, a smiling and gentle exterior masks ominous
undercurrents which outsiders must probe to fathom.
   Newly established opposition parties, such as a grassroots Uzbek
movement called Birlik, or Unity, agitate for sovereignty and a
return to Asian roots. Some organizations go further.
   ``We are many, and we are growing,'' confided one dissident, a
Tadzhik entrepreneur, who agreed to speak anonymously only after
cautious introductions. He described underground groups which seek
a total break with Moscow.
   ``Lithuania is a textbook, and we are reading it carefully,'' he
said. But unlike the Baltic states, he added, Uzbekistan had a high
potential for sustained violence.
   His own group is dominated by Tadzhiks who argue that since they
built Samarkand, Soviet planners should have put it in
Tadzhikistan, not Uzbekistan, and it is never too late to change.
   As long as Samarkand is only a potential powder keg, officials
continue to push its strong points and hope for the best. KGB
agents, with less to do than in Moscow, remain on the alert.
   ``Oh no, we have no problems here,'' assured the concierge at
the Hotel Samarkand when asked about ethnic relations. ``I am an
Armenian, and I have lived here all my life. No problems.''
   Then she vanished into a back room before the next question.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Gerald Celente is a professional trend tracker,
helping his clients develop products, services and advertising
strategies for profit in an ever-changing world. He's also playing
his own hunch to cash in on growing concern about the environment.
He's created Enviroman, predicting that he could be America's next
animated superhero.

   Late at night, on the outskirts of
Homesville, a truck pulls to the side of the road. Two men begin
unloading barrels of chemical waste in the shadows.
   A second vehicle speeds to the scene _ a sporty, solar-powered
little number with all of the power but none of the roar of its
fossil fuel-burning counterparts.
   Out steps a futuristically clad man with Paul Newman blue eyes,
a Clint Eastwood jaw and Patrick Swayze hair. He saunters over to
the men as they drain toxic fluid into a nearby creek.
   Sensing the figure behind them, they turn around. Recognition
glazes their eyes with fear. The men know their illegal dumping
days are over. They've just come face to face with Enviroman!
   The animated superhero of the future? Just maybe. Gerald
Celente, the creator of Enviroman, has a hunch that the
evil-thwarting heroics of Enviroman will surpass those of Superman
and the Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles in the imagination of the
younger set.
   Just what is it that makes Celente think his Enviroman will join
the ranks of the great American heroes?
   Trends.
   Celente tracks them. The 43-year-old Rhinebeck man is the author
of ``Trend Tracking,'' a 300-page guide to translating trends into
strategies, products, and ultimately, profit.
   Celente identifies a trend as a definite, predictable direction
or sequence of events, like the warming of the earth's climate.
   The idea, according to Celente, is to ``keep looking at all the
different trends that are going on out there and see how your
product could fit in.''
   Enviroman, for example.
   When it comes to speed, this hero's no match for a speeding
bullet. And he's not nearly as powerful as a locomotive. In fact,
if the decidedly human Enviroman has his way, he'll never even
throw a punch.
   That's because Celente's research has shown that right now
Americans are concerned about the state of the planet, global
warming and the destruction of the ozone. He's also tracked a
reversal of public support for defense spending, which has given
way to a growing interest in disarmament and peace.
   So Enviroman protects the planet _ but without the benefit of an
arsenal of weapons packed into a ``batbelt,'' nor the obvious
advantage of being able to leap tall buildings in a single bound.
Instead, he's a martial arts expert.
   ``Enviroman's not a superhero,'' says Celente, who created the
animated crime fighter now under consideration by King Features
Syndicate for a multi-media series. ``He's human because real
people have to solve the problems. Instead of fighting hostile
aliens, he fights criminals against the environment.''
   Also through research, Celente found a trend among young boys
toward acoustic instruments. So Enviroman was given a sax and
placed in a band which takes him all over the world.
   To capture the fancy of young females partial to the
environmental cause Enviroman was also given rugged good looks.
   Crossing trends and developing products and advertising
strategies is the basis of Celente's work as director of the
Socio-Economic Research Institute of America based in Rhinebeck.
The firm is a consortium of 25 experts from fields including
economics, education, engineering, banking and psychology.
   Celente and other members of the Institute work from their
homes, which are scattered throughout the country. Researchers
communicate with each other via computers and fax machines.
   The Institute teaches its clients how to manage trends, Celente
says, and how to translate them into products and services.
   Those clients are involved in banking, the food industry,
product development and other areas, he says. Citing
confidentiality, Celente won't disclose the names of the companies
which employ him.
   Celeste founded the Institute in 1980. It was an idea born in
the '70s during the Bronx native's tenure as a government affairs
specialist.
   ``I'd read things, file information, cross-reference, and I
realized everything's connected,'' Celente says. ``It's all one
system.''
   He calls the Institute's method of integrating data from
multiple fields ``Globalnomics.''
   ``The key to our system is making connections between seemingly
unrelated fields, '' Celente says. ``By looking at trends and tying
things together, you can anticipate changes and profit from them.''
   So who can profit from trends? According to ``Trend Tracking,''
anyone with enough common sense to position himself for them. And
to make it easier, ``Trend Tracking'' concludes with an A to Z
directory of profit opportunities. Leafing through it is a little
like gazing into Celente's crystal ball:
   _Air Conditioners: Demand for air conditioners will grow as the
earth gets warmer, says ``Trend Tracking.'' Because of the
chlorofluorocarbon  the old
cordoba, now dubbed ``piggies'' _ has made a confusing economy even
more so. ``I have to think twice before going out to buy
anything,'' says a middle-class housewife. ``And not just because
everything is so expensive. It's the conversions back and forth.
They give me a headache.''

   Over the summer while NBC's ``Grand'' was
being revamped, Bonnie Hunt spent her time off working in a
hospital.
   ``It's better than going to acting school,'' she says. ``If you
haven't had a lot of experience it can be difficult to portray
people in everyday situations.''
   Hunt went back home to Chicago to work as a nurse _ her career
before she became a stand-up comedian and actress.
   ``I was a volunteer nurse in the Veterans Hospital in Chicago,''
she says. ``I also worked at a nursing home for a while. I was
really just doing it for myself. I enjoy working with the patients.
It's my favorite thing in the whole world.''
   Meanwhile, her comedy series, which made its debut last January,
is being changed to emphasize the class and economic differences
between Hunt's Carol Anne Smithson and Pamela Reed's Janice
Pasetti. Some cast members will go, including Michael McKean, who
played Hunt's husband.
   In the show, Carol Anne is the niece of the town patriarch,
played by John Randolph. Janice, a single mother living in a
trailer park, works as their housekeeper. This season Carol Anne
and Janice will live in the same house.
   ``I don't know what they have planned for us,'' Hunt says. ``I
think my husband will just disappear. I think if he died Carol Anne
would be affected for a long time. When we started the show Carol
Anne was so in love with her husband. In the pilot she wanted a
child and wanted sex all the time, but I couldn't play that level
all the time. I wanted to play someone people could identify with.
   ``She's going to miss her husband. She wanted to be loved and
approved. She's a woman who defines herself by the man she's with.
She looks at Janice and thinks she's so worldly. Janice looks at
her and thinks she has money. You look at people and apply your own
values and ideas to them.''
   When she's not working, Hunt lives in Chicago with her husband,
John Murphy.
   ``My husband calls me Lucy and himself Ricky Ricardo. He works
at a bank and every year we go to the boss's home for dinner. Last
year it was a pool party. My body has never seen the sun, so I
stayed in jeans. This year I broke the door handle off his boss'
new Porsche.
   ``I came from such a traditional family. My father was Ralph
Kramden. When I was in the sixth-grade I taped Johnny Carson
interviewing Joey Bishop. I put in my voice for Joey Bishop's and
gave it to my father for Fathers Day. He was so tickled. He'd call
up people and play it over the telephone''
   Although she wanted to go into comedy, her father insisted she
have another profession. He died while she was still in nursing
school.
   ``I loved my Dad so much,'' she says. ``So many fathers in my
neighborhood died young. My parents talked to us about our lives
and led very exemplary lives. He was an electrician supervisor for
the Board of Education. Every Christmas he'd divide up his paycheck
among his men. He'd come home and say he didn't get paid.''
   Her mother, Alice Hunt, a former singer, works in administration
at Shriners Hospital in Chicago. ``She played the organ and piano
every day when we were growing up,'' Hunt says. ``I used to say
when she woke up in the morning there were little birds singing
over her head.''
   While working in a cancer ward during the day, Hunt entered the
acting profession doing improvisational comedy at night. Her
patients kept scrapbooks of her reviews. She later became a member
of Second City.
   Hunt had just left the Second City troupe in Santa Monica and
taken a job in a yogurt store when she auditioned for ``Grand.''
   ``At the audition I changed a few words to make it sound more
natural,'' she says. ``Usually writers don't like it, but Michael
Leeson told me to improvise.''
   She paused. ``I never did start my job at the yogurt store.''
   Before ``Grand,'' Hunt was probably best known as the waitress
in ``Rain Man,'' the one who dropped the toothpicks.

   The new Broadway season doesn't get under way
until early October, a little later than usual, but already there
has been a lot of drama off the stage.
   The theatrics concerned ``Miss Saigon'' and whether the hit
London musical will open in New York as scheduled next April.
Producer Cameron Mackintosh scrapped the engagement, despite a
record $25 million advance, after Actors' Equity refused to let the
show's white British star, Jonathan Pryce, appear here in the role
of a Eurasian pimp.
   The union barred Pryce because it could not ``appear to condone
the casting of a Caucasian in the role of a Eurasian.'' After a
firestorm of protests from its members, Equity reversed its
decision. Now Mackintosh and Equity are talking ``in an effort to
establish a working relationship'' that could result in the musical
coming to New York. Don't count ``Miss Saigon'' out just yet.
   The controversy has overshadowed the season's other musicals,
most of them lacking in star power.
   Seven musicals are expected to open before Christmas, including
``Shogun,'' another big Far East song-and-dance saga. Based on
James Clavell's mammoth novel, the show tells of the romance
between an English sea captain and a Japanese woman. Peter Karrie
and June Angela star. John Driver did the book and lyrics. Paul
Chihara of ``China Beach'' fame supplied the music. Preview
performances start Nov. 1 with an opening set for Nov. 15 at the
Marquis Theater.
   Another exotic musical, ``Once on This Island,'' arrives Oct. 18
at the Booth Theater. Preview performances begin Oct. 2. The show,
with book and lyrics by Lynn Ahrens and music by Stephen Flaherty,
is a Caribbean fairy tale about a young peasant girl and the son of
a wealthy landowner.
   Rock 'n' roll legend Buddy Holly gets his own musical,
appropriately titled ``Buddy.'' It opens Nov. 4 at the Shubert
Theater after two weeks of preview performances. Holly died in 1959
at the age of 22 in a plane crash. The musical, first done in
London where it is still running, stars Paul Hipp as the teen idol.
   ``Those Were the Days,'' billed as an English-Yiddish musical,
bows Oct. 23 at the Edison Theater. Bruce Adler and Lori Wilner
star in the revue, which celebrates the Jewish experience from
Second Avenue to Broadway.
   Two musical revivals that have had long national tours finally
will make the trek to Broadway. ``Fiddler on the Roof'' begins
preview performances Nov. 3 at the Gershwin Theater for an opening
later in the month. Topol, who starred in the film version, will
play Tevye, everyone's favorite milkman.
   ``Peter Pan'' flies back to town for performances beginning Dec.
11 at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater. This time around the boy who never
grew up will be played by gymnast Cathy Rigby. She reportedly not
only flies across the stage but out over the audience, too.
   The fall's third major musical revival will be ``Oh, Kay!'', the
1920s George and Ira Gershwin classic, with an all-black cast. The
show, best known for its songs ``Someone To Watch Over Me,'' ``Do,
Do, Do'' and ``Maybe,'' opens Oct. 25 at the Richard Rodgers
Theater after a month of previews.
   New plays will be in short supply on Broadway this fall. The
season's first of three dramatic offerings will be ``Stand-Up
Tragedy'' by Bill Cain. The play concerns an idealistic high school
teacher on New York's Lower East Side. Jack Coleman of ``Dynasty''
fame plays the teacher. Marcus Chong portrays one of the students
he tries to save. Previews begin Sept. 25 before an Oct. 4 premiere
at the Criterion Center.
   John Guare's ``Six Degrees of Separation,'' which opened in June
at the tiny Mitzi Newhouse Theater in Lincoln Center, moves to the
Broadway-size Vivian Beaumont Theater on Nov. 8. The play is about
a young black man who finagles his way into several wealthy
Manhattan households. The stars are Stockard Channing and John
Cunningham, who play the gullible hosts. Courtney B. Vance is the
clever intruder.
   Nigel Hawthorne and Jane Alexander star in ``Shadowlands,''
William Nicholson's retelling of the love story of author C.S.
Lewis and Joy Davidman. Previews begin Nov. 2 for the London
success, and opening night is Nov. 11 at the Brooks Atkinson
Theater.
   The fall's lone play revival will be Moliere's ``The Miser,''
starring Philip Bosco and Carole Shelley. The comedy begins
previews Sept. 9 at Circle in the Square with an opening set for
early October.
   Two one-man productions of comedy and music are also planned.
Michael Feinstein sings and plays George and Ira Gershwin, Rodgers
and Hart, Irving Berlin and other classic songwriters in his show
``Piano and Voice.'' The opening is Oct. 2 at the Golden Theater.
Jackie Mason, late of television's ``Chicken Soup,'' returns to
Broadway Oct. 11 at the Neil Simon Theater with a new edition of
his comedy routines that wowed New York several seasons ago.
   After New Year's, two major musicals are scheduled to arrive,
one off-Broadway. ``Nick and Nora,'' a reworking of ``The Thin
Man,'' stars Barry Bostwick as the suave detective and Joanna
Gleason as his sophisticated wife. The book and direction are by
Arthur Laurents, the music by Charles Strouse and the lyrics by
Richard Maltby Jr. Look for the show in February at a theater to be
announced.
   Also planned for early 1991 is ``Assassins,'' the new Stephen
Sondheim musical about presidential killers. The book is by John
Weidman who wrote ``Pacific Overtures'' with Sondheim. Preview
performances begin Dec. 18 with an opening scheduled for sometime
in January at off-Broadway's Playwrights Horizons.
   Among the other play possibilities for later in the season are
``Doublecross,'' a thriller by Washington lawyer Gary Bohlke, and
``Lost in Yonkers,'' a new work by Neil Simon. Other musical
candidates include ``Fame,'' about students at New York's High
School of the Performing Arts, and ``Heart's Desire,'' based on
four short stories by writers such as Armistead Maupin and Treva
Silverman.
   All dates are subject to change. So are the shows. There is even
talk of resurrecting ``Annie 2,'' one of last season's formidable
out-of-town flops. One thing Broadway never lacks is hope.

   ``Internal Affairs'' (Paramount Home Video. VHS-Beta. No
suggested retail price. Rated R)
   The men and women who police the police are the lowest of the
low to their fellow officers _ pariahs, scum, Hitlers in blue. But
the feeling is more than mutual.
   In Mike Figgis' ``Internal Affairs,'' the clash of wills and
collision of ethics come barreling to a bloody and shattering
conclusion for Detective Raymond Avila and Dennis Peck, the
celebrated street cop he brings down.
   Avila (Andy Garcia) is a methodical and eager cop who gets
promoted to the Internal Affairs Division of the Los Angeles
police. He believes in his job and he believes in the law. His
partner, Amy (Laurie Metcalf), is a careful investigator who goes
by the book and who understands that all their job means is a shot
at becoming a lieutenant.
   A routine investigation of excessive violence in an arrest by
another police officer leads the pair to suspect Peck of being the
mastermind behind a complicated network of crime ranging from
murder to extortion to prostitution to money laundering and fraud.
   Peck (Richard Gere) is a master manipulator who knows what
buttons to push to get a desired reaction from people and thus set
plans to his liking. He's also a loathesome misogynist and racist.
   He and Avila lock horns. And Peck, finding Avila's Achilles
heel, plays a psychological game that involves Avila's wife,
Kathleen (Nancy Travis).
   After a memorable bit in ``The Untouchables'' as the fed who
lines up a killing shot while stretched out at an impossible angle
on a staircase, and teaming with Michael Douglas as a cop in
``Black Rain,'' Garcia has landed his first starring role. But
there's more to this actor than cop roles. His smoldering good
looks, quiet manner and intensity hold promise for greater things
to come.
   He's convincing as Avila, revealing his hot Latin passions,
vulnerabilities and quiet pursuit of the law. Less convincing is
Gere, who gives a one-note performance that erupts at the end in
almost comic book frenzy.
   Figgis' uneven pacing and reliance on blood and guts makes this
a difficult movie to watch on the home screen.

   ``Heart Condition'' (RCA-Columbia Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.95.
Rated R)
   Is racism the stuff that comedy is made of? Can bigotry get a
laugh or two? As writer and director, James D. Parriott has
borrowed freely from the Hollywood movie mill to craft his film
about a heart transplant, sex, drugs and politics, a coverup and
murder and the improbable relationship between a black ghost and a
bigoted white cop.
   Unfortunately, Parriott, whose work has been limited to
televison (``Six Million Dollar Man,'' ``Island Sons,'' ``From Here
to Eternity''), brings a TV mentality to ``Heart Condition'' with
quick-fix sight gags and jokes. You can almost imagine a laugh
track.
   He has all the standard characters: a prostitute with a heart of
gold; a classy lawyer who works for gangsters; a seedy and bigoted
vice cop; a slick pimp; a police captain who spends most of his
time playing golf.
   There's also the standard story line: A high-powered senator
dies while having sex and drugs with two hookers. There's a
coverup, and the silencing of those who knew or might have known.
And who is to solve the dastardly deed? The seedy, bigoted vice cop
with a brand new heart.
   Napoleon Stone (Denzel Washington) is a successful lawyer whose
clients include high-class hookers, including Crystal (Chloe Webb),
the former girlfriend of vice cop Jack Moony (Bob Hoskins).
   Crystal, a camera fanatic, snapped pictures during the lust-drug
romp with the senator and gave the film to Moony for safe keeping.
The senator's death is listed as a heart attack and the two hookers
are under the watchful eye of the pimp who arranged the date.
Certain Washington politicos think Crystal might have told her
lawyer about the incident, so they kill him.
   Meanwhile, Moony, a lover of junk food, fat and liquor, has a
heart attack and will die unless given a new heart. He gets Stone's
heart. He also gets Stone's ghost, a dapper gent who has a change
of clothes in just about every scene.
   Where have we seen all of this before. Let's see, the heart
transplant recalls that Raymond St. Jacques-Leslie Nielsen
blaxploitation flick, ``A Change of Mind,'' in which a white
district attorney's brain is transplanted into a black man's body.
   The ghost part is easy _ all those wonderful ``Topper'' movies
with Roland Young. Only ``Heart Condition'' lacks the unspoiled
sophistication of the Kirbys' ghostly existence. As for the sleazy
white cop-black man buddy movie, there's ``48 Hrs.,'' with Nick
Nolte and Eddie Murphy.
   There are some fun moments, though: Moony walking along with his
arm around the ghost's shoulder, getting puzzled looks from
passersby. There's also a funny bit when Stone tries to stop Moony
from eating a hamburger dripping with grease and cheese. The scene
has Hoskins wrestling a hamburger to the ground before stunned
lunchers. Shades of ``Roger Rabbit.''
   After a while, Moony actually starts to like Stone, gets the bad
guys, wins back Crystal and helps her raise the baby she and Stone
had. Unfortunately, this could be the perfect set-up for a sequel.
   Hoskins and Washington are both top-flight actors, who are
versatile enough to handle high drama (Washington in ``Glory'' and
``A Soldier's Story,'' Hoskins in ``Mona Lisa'' and ``A Prayer for
the Dying'') as well as comedy (Washington in ``Carbon Copy'' and
Hoskins in ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit.'') They handle the script and
the story with grace. There also are excellent support performances
by Webb and Roger E. Mosley as Capt. Wendt.
   In ``Heart Condition,'' the laughs are indeed there, but there
are also too many slow pockets. And the movie is also just a tad
too derivative.
   Still, it's not a bad diversion for a lazy Friday night vidfest.

   Music of Grainger, Koechlin, Piston, Walton and Diepenbrock
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   When a new recording technology such as the compact disc
matures, the listener benefits.
   Such major labels as Sony Classical may keep churning out
war-horse pieces by war-horse performers and rising stars making a
name.
   Even the usually admirable Telarc can perpetrate something as
shameful as a ``Best of Beethoven,'' as it did recently in a CD
consisting of movements from various Beethoven works in its catalog.
   But smaller companies, and lately some of the conglomerates, can
turn to other things: reissues of historical performances by
legendary artists on discs with improved sound, or CDs of music by
the lesser known composer, even the historical nonentity, which
broaden our knowledge and open us up to new delights.
   The latter category is examined here.
   Quick! Name a famous Dutch composer! Maybe Sweelinck comes to
mind, but since his lifetime (1562-1621), the Netherlands has not
had many composers of international renown _ until Alphons
Diepenbrock, who died at the age of 68 in 1921. A self-taught
follower of Wagner, he was influenced by late Beethoven and
Debussy. Diepenbrock had a literary bent and was a trained
classicist.
   It's not surprising, then, that a recent Chandos disc devoted to
him includes his overture to Aristophanes' play ``The Birds,'' the
Marsyas Concert Suite based on Greek mythology and the Elektra
Symphonic Suite. Included is the Hymn for Violin and Orchestra.
   Diepenbrock's appealing music is dramatic and extroverted. He
uses leitmotifs (short, recurring musical themes) and shows a
strong grasp of orchestral colors. The Residentie Orchestra of the
Hague, conducted by Hans Vonk, performs convincingly. Emmy Verhey
is the able soloist.
   Also in the dramatic vein is the same company's first volume of
Sir William Walton's film music on a disc full of sirs. Sir Neville
Marriner conducts the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields, with Sir
John Gielgud narrating Sir Laurence Olivier's ``Hamlet.'' Also on
the disc is the music to ``As You Like It.''
   Like practically all film music, one hears traces of Stravinsky
and Wagner, and like all really good film music, one wants to see
the movie while listening to it.
   The project is worthy and makes good music accessible. The
various sections are well woven together by Christopher Palmer.
   Gielgud, as to be expected, reads portions of the text as a
knight of the theater. Unfortunately, his aged voice sounds
completely inappropriate for Hamlet. But that's fine if the words
are listened to for their music.
   Another composer of film music was the neglected French composer
Charles Koechlin (1867-1950), who turned to the form late in a life
that produced more than 200 works.
   The West German label Audite has released a disc of Koechlin's
oboe works, played by Lajos Lencses.
   The pieces are introspective, yet not intimate, composed in a
delicate and sometimes meandering style. Lencses is a graceful,
full-bodied oboist with a tendency to sound monochromatic.
   Koch International Classics has released a disc of Percy
Grainger orchestral pieces played by the Melbourne Symphony
Orchestra, conducted by Geoffrey Simon.
   The Melbourne-born Grainger (1882-1961) was friends with Delius
and Grieg, trained in Germany and lived most of his life in the
United States.
   His chief characteristic, amply displayed on this disc, lies in
a propensity to use folk tunes, which can sound irritating in big
orchestral treatments. It's a particular taste. The recorded sound
is slightly murky and the orchestra a little bland.
   Walter Piston uses another kind of indigenous music _ jazz _ in
his works, though more artfully so. One of the great American
composers, Piston (1894-1976) is a master of orchestral color,
whose symphonic music bubbles with syncopated energy.
   Gerard Schwarz, conducting the New York Chamber Symphony and
Seattle Symphony, brings an intensity and compactness of sound to
the second and sixth symphonies and Sinfonietta on an excellent
Delos recording.

<HEAD>The Artists: World's Best Preserved Prehistoric Art Sanctuary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HANNS NEUERBOURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTIGNAC, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It is a dream of millions of children
everywhere _ the dream of finding a hidden treasure. It came true
50 years ago for four French youngsters who discovered what turned
out to be the cradle of world art.
   With its magnificent murals, created more than 17,000 years ago,
the Lascaux cave near this Dordogne town is rated by experts to
contain the world's finest and best preserved display of
prehistoric draftsmanship.
   Hundreds of thousands have admired the vivid colors of its
paintings and the clarity of their lines. But mass pilgrimages to
the hillside cave in southwest France brought them to the verge of
destruction, forcing its closing in 1963.
   A team of scientists using modern technology repaired the damage
and restored the former environmental conditions inside the cave
and thus ensured survival of mankind's earliest masterpieces.
   Art was hardly on the minds of the four boys, who were between
15 and 18, when took a day off from school on Sept. 12, 1940 and
roamed the dense forest above the Vezere River. Legend had it there
was a secret underground passage extending into the hill from a
little chateau at its foot.
   ``Like all children, we thought, of course, that a treasure was
hidden there,'' Simon Coencas, the youngest of the four, recalled
in an interview with The Associated Press. ``That day three of us
were again in the forest. Then a fourth buddy, Marcel Ravidat,
showed up.
   `` `I think I have discovered the underground passage,' he told
us, `There is a hole in the ground and I think that's it.' ''
   The hole was barely 80 centimeters (2.6 feet) wide and deep. But
pebbles the boys dropped through a small opening at the bottom
indicated it went deeper.
   ``So we made the hole wider,'' continued Coencas, now 65 and an
industrialist living near Paris. ``But no one wanted to go down
first, except Marcel, the oldest and a real daredevil. We followed
after he shouted that he was in a cave.''
   They landed right in the main cavern, which has since became
known as the ``hall of the bulls'' for the huge red, brown and
black paintings of bisons that dominate the murals. The boys were
awe-struck by what they saw on the white limestone walls in the
flicker of their petroleum lamp.
   ``It was marvellous,'' Coencas recalled. ``Something one had
never seen. It was like a dream. We decided to return the next day
to explore the cave more closely and keep our find secret. But then
we thought we should tell at least our schoolteacher about it.
   ``At first he thought we were joking. But when we took him there
and had a look he immediately informed the authorities.''
   For days, the boys continued a vigil at ``their'' cave until the
arrival of Henri Breuil, a Catholic priest with a worldwide
reputation for his archaeological studies.
   ``My God,'' he is said to have exclaimed. ``This is a
prehistoric Sistine Chapel.'' He marveled at the exciting color
combinations created with simple materials such as ocher, iron
oxides and carbon, mixed with animal fat, bone marrow or blood.
   Breuil swiftly authenticated the paintings and engravings, and
three months later the cave was declared a national monument.
   It took him years to compile an inventory of the more than 1,000
paintings, drawings and engravings of bisons, horses, stags, hinds,
ibexes and other animals often pierced by arrows or lances.
   One puzzling mural depicts a mortally wounded bison seemingly
butting a fallen nude male hunter. A pole topped by a bird's head
is also part of the scene. Scientists say the cave was never
inhabited but must have served as a center for magic rites designed
to induce success in hunting.
   Lascaux was discovered by the tourist industry following its
opening to the public in 1948. It became a popular destination for
travelers from all over the world. Visitors reached a peak of
125,000 in 1962.
   But green spots on the frescoes caused increasing alarm among
archaeologists. Algae, mosses, ferns began spreading rapidly over
the murals. In addition, calcite began veiling the art.
   Exposure to changes in temperatures, caused by body heat, to
carbon dioxide and moisture from large groups threatened to efface
within decades what had survived for millenniums. The cave was
closed to the general public on April 2, 1963, and a team of 40
specialists began the salvage operations.
   The inside was sprayed with antibiotics and the walls were
treated with formaldehyde solutions. After two years, all
aggressive microorganisms were destroyed. Stopping the formation of
calcite by close climatic controls took longer.
   ``The cave has recovered,'' said Jean-Philippe Rigaud, director
of the Bordeaux-based Prehistoric Antiquities office who is in
charge of all caves in the Aquitaine region. ``But to keep it in
good health we have to apply strict rules for its protection.''
   The temperature inside is kept at a constant 12.5 Celsius (54.5
Fahrenheit). More than 50 control instruments also measure air
pressure and humidity and warn of other changes affecting the
natural balance that existed in the 150-yard-long cave before its
discovery.
   Rigaud said carbon-dating of remnants found in the cave
suggested the murals were created about 17,500 years ago. But he
said a recent study suggests that the method may not be completely
reliable and that Lascaux may be even ``a bit older.''
   Since 1963, access to the cave is limited to five visitors a day
on five days per week, chiefly scientists and other holders of
special passes. Their shoes are treated with an antibacterial
liquid so there is no relapse of the ``biological threat.''
   International demand for passes is so heavy that handling
correspondence is a full-time job for one of Rigaud's staffers.
Some scientists apply two years in advance to be sure to get a date.
   ``Increasing that number is absolutely ruled out,'' Rigaud said.
``We could not take such a risk. And everybody has accepted this''.
   The danger from mass tourism also forced authorities to seal off
the cave of Altamira in northwest Spain which comes close to
Lascaux in artistic splendor.
   Admission to the third most important center of prehistoric art,
the Grotto of Niaux, in France's Pyrenees region, was limited to
220 a day three years ago, although its vast system of galleries
makes it less vulnerable.
   At Lascaux, a replica of the main cavern constructed about 200
meters from the original, has become a new tourist attraction since
its completion in 1983. Up to 2,000 visitors a day admire the
reproduction of the ``hall of the bulls.''
   ``It's a good thing,'' Rigaud said. ``It gives quite a precise
idea of what they would see in the original.''
   Does he think that Lascaux will remain the last important
prehistoric discovery?
   ``We could find a cave comparable to Lascaux even tomorrow,''
Rigaud said. ``To achieve such quality (in Lascaux), the artists
must have at first practiced (in other caves) with other pictures.
Either those caves were completely wiped out by erosion or the
caves have not yet been discovered.''

   Jane Wiedlin's group consciousness started at
age 10 _ in church.
   ``I was raised Catholic, but we went to this sort of hippy
Catholic church,'' explained Wiedlin, the former Go-Go who has
released her third solo album, ``Tangled.''
   ``The preacher was this young, hip, cute priest. We had this
church band I was in. We'd sing the popular songs of the time. We'd
sing `Leaving on a Jet Plane' in church. We got away with bloody
murder.
   ``That environment sort of nurtured people to be socially aware,
and to try and be a good person. That group of people was trying to
live out the Christian ethic, trying to help other people.''
   She's craved community ever since, as a punk in Hollywood, as
rhythm guitarist for the Go-Go's and as an active member of the
animal rights movement. But she also takes time off to be alone, to
write songs about peace and love and consider the challenge of
making happy music in a sad world.
   ``I am somewhere in the middle,'' she said, dressed cheerfully
at the EMI Records office in a purple sweatshirt and purple shorts,
a purple headband wrapped around her jet black hair.
   ``I can really start thinking too much about everything, but on
the other hand, you can't give up. You got to keep trying. I think
life is full of small little joys that you have to grab onto.''
   Happiness is offered in three-minute bites on ``Tangled.'' This
is ear candy, but bittersweet, with fears of the future hidden
under sunny harmonies. In ``Flowers on the Battlefield,'' she
worries ``innocence gets crushed beneath the anger and desire, and
everything that's pure and good gets caught in the crossfire.''
   ``I wanted to write a song about war and not be so specific so
that that's all it could be about,'' she said. ``I wanted it to be
on all different levels, in war and relationships in general.
   ``It's not just the battlers that get hurt, but the innocent
victims as well. I'm kind of on the outside looking at the
situation. I was thinking more about children, really. The picture
in my head was of war and think of what gets decimated in the war,
of soldiers and children and animals.''
   With the Go-Go's, Wiedlin was right in the middle, the one who
left the band first and helped speed its breakup in 1985. She met
the other members _ Belinda Carlisle, Charlotte Caffey, Gina Schock
and Kathy Valentine _ in the late 1970s, in the Hollywood punk
clubs where Wiedlin hung out as a teen-ager.
   The Go-Go's, like the Beach Boys in the 1960s, presented fun as
a way of life. ``We Got the Beat'' set the tone, a snappy update of
the Beach Boys' ``I Get Around'' that captured the attitude of five
young women who wrote their own songs and played their own
instruments.
   But the breakup in 1985 was a nasty affair with name-calling and
finger-pointing and rumors of drugs and emotional problems.
Briefly, Wiedlin recalls, she was glad to get away.
   ``First there was the whole relief that everybody else's
problems weren't my problems anymore,'' she said. ``I had to deal
with emotional problems with four people who were worse off than I
was, basically.
   ``On my first solo album (`Jane Wiedlin'), I had a song called
`Traveling Heart,' which was about feeling disloyal and I was
writing about it because I was in love with two different men.
   ``But in the end, the song was about leaving the Go-Go's.
Because I had terrible guilt feelings about leaving the band. Talk
about leaving a deserting ship. I really felt like a rat.''
   ``Tangled'' is a good way of summing up her solo career. ``Jane
Wiedlin,'' which included a song called ``One Hundred Years of
Solitude,'' sold poorly. Her next record, ``Fur,'' quickly produced
a hit single, ``Inside a Dream,'' but was forgotten after the next
single flopped.
   ``They just of dropped the whole project. Goodbye Jane Wiedlin
until the next record,'' she said of her record company. ``It was
horrible at the time. I talked to them about it probably a thousand
times.
   ``I try and be nice about it, but shoot, it not only hurt my
feelings it hurt my career. I need some support this time. I know
everybody feels stupid and bad about that record.''
   Meanwhile, group consciousness has caught up with her again.
She's patched things up with the other Go-Go's and a November
reunion tour is planned.
   Wiedlin's married now and says a part of her really has settled
down and adjusted to being on her own. But still, there's something
about walking into a room and finding it filled with all these
people.
   ``I started missing the camaraderie and support system of being
in a band. I walked into the rehearsals straight off a plane,
having spent four nights on my own with this album in England,''
she said.
   ``They had already been in rehearsals for a week and I was so
panicked about being a Go-Go again and doing all these songs. But
it felt comfortable, and within minutes everybody was coming up
with jokes that we used to crack up at.''

<TEXT>
   There's no question older people are a golden
market for all kinds of businesses, and the senior citizen
discounts that seem to be everywhere have been increasing. But some
experts predict their demise.
   The Florida Restaurant Association found 25 percent of its
members offer senior discounts, up from 20 percent in 1988,
spokesman Robert Nelson said.
   But the restaurants are turning even more quickly to early-bird
specials, hoping to attract the same clientele by differentiating
dining hours rather than age.
   The percentage of members offering early-bird specials went from
17 percent in 1988 to 52 percent this year, Nelson said.
   ``The perception is that these are skinflints out there looking
for the lowest possible dollar,'' said Ralph Gasparello, head of
the National Association of Senior Travel Planners based in
Hingham, Mass. ``That might have been the case, but I think now
you've got a whole new group coming up the ladder.''
   The 1,570-inn Choice Hotels International, which runs Clarion
Hotels and Quality, Comfort, Rodeway and Sleep inns, has focused on
the senior market for four years.
   ``When we did our research, we found that there was a lot of
other things besides discounts that seniors wanted,'' said
marketing director Bill Todd. ``Three words: consistency,
credibility and reliability.''
   The chain reserved first-floor and non-smoking rooms in part of
its effort to appeal to seniors, and business in its Senior Saver
Discount program went up 716 percent in the year ending in June,
Todd said.
   Royal Cruise Lines based in San Francisco was the first in its
industry to associate with the American Heart Association to
develop a health-conscious menu, and it offers lecture programs on
some cruises to target older vacationers, Jeff Ostroff, author of
the book ``Successful Marketing to the 50- Plus Consumer,'' found
in his research.
   Margaret Lynne Duggar, vice chairwoman of the Florida Pepper
Commission on Aging and a consultant on targeting older markets,
sees businesses moving away from straight discounts in the 1990s.
   ``Across the nation, it seems logical that the older consumer
will become such a large proportion of the buying public that
offering discounts mainly based on age will not be a viable option
for business in the future,'' she said.
   ``The benefit of a pricing program like that disappears if
everybody's doing it,'' said Greg Gable of Age Wave Inc. in
Emeryville, Calif., an information service company focusing on
older customers. ``Companies are starting to look at how to go a
step further.''
   With the poverty level among seniors at about 13 percent, value
often is more important to older Americans than price.
   ``Millions of people are willing to spend the 50 cents more if
they think they're going to get the good product, the good service,
the good experience,'' Ostroff said. ``That's a mindset that's less
likely to be found in a 21-year-old than in a 51-year-old.''
   An age standard also can be a problem _ drawing resentment from
seniors who feel it's demeaning to be singled out by age and
generating age discrimination charges by those left out.
   Peter Levine of Plantation, Fla., filed a complaint with the
Broward County Human Relations Division over a C&amp;S Bank checking
account reserved for people 55 and over.
   He rejected a settlement that would have classified him as an
``honorary senior'' to get the account. ``It's unconscionable. It's
like welfare for the rich,'' he said.
   Ostroff says a discount is a no-cost quick fix that doesn't
require any investment of time or money and doesn't build brand or
name loyalty.
   ``I don't have any problem with marketing programs that are
designed to attract regardless of age,'' he said. ``I really have a
problem with the ageist one. I really think it's age discrimination
and reverse discrimination.''

<HEAD>Death With Dignity Initiative Gathers Steam in Washington State</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARRIE FIGDOR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A law under consideration in Washington state
would give dying people more power to end their lives with the help
of their physicians, who could not be tried for murder for
assisting suicides.
   Proponents of the initiative say it has been buoyed by the
publicity surrounding the case of a Michigan doctor who may be
charged with murder for providing a sick woman with the means to
kill herself.
   ``Just let her go peacefully!'' pleaded Mildred Scherneck, in
tears as she thought of her hospitalized 97-year-old mother. ``It
isn't that I want to lose her, but when a person gets like she is,
they shouldn't let her live.''
   Scherneck had just signed a citizens initiative known as the
Death With Dignity Initiative, which would be the first legalizing
assisted suicide.
   More than 104,000 people statewide have signed Initiative 119
since the campaign began May 3. Organizers have until Dec. 31 to
gather 150,001 valid signatures to get the initiative on the 1991
ballot if the Legislature doesn't approve it first.
   ``We are very confident that we will make it,'' said Karen
Cooper, the initiative's campaign coordinator. ``We are finding
that clearly the citizens of Washington are ready for this law.''
   ``If you're in sound mind, you should be able to make that
decision (to die). I think it's our God-given right,'' said Muriel
Boyd, who signed the petition because she had to watch her father
die painfully of cancer 11 years ago.
   The initiative would amend the state's 1979 Natural Death Act to
expand a terminally ill but mentally competent adult's right to die.
   It defines a ``terminal condition'' as one in which two
physicians say in writing that a patient has no more than six
months to live or is in an irreversible coma or a persistent
vegetative state.
   It would redefine ``life-sustaining measures'' to include
artificial hydration and nutrition.
   It adds a unique aid-in-dying provision, defined as ``a medical
service provided in person by a physician that will end the life of
a conscious and mentally competent qualified patient in a
dignified, painless and humane manner, when requested voluntarily
by the patient through a written directive executed at the time the
medical service is desired . . . .''
   At no time could aid-in-dying be administered at the request of
anyone other than the patient.
   Cooper said the publicity surrounding the assisted suicide of
Janet Adkins in Michigan helped the initiative's cause, although
the initiative would not have applied to Adkins' case.
   Adkins, a Portland, Ore., resident who had been diagnosed last
year with Alzheimer's disease, killed herself outside Detroit on
June 4 by using a suicide machine built by Dr. Jack Kevorkian. The
machine injects a chemical that induces coma followed by another
chemical that causes death.
   Kevorkian has been barred by a Michigan court from using the
machine while prosecutors decide whether they will try him.
   However, last month authorities in Michigan charged a California
man with murder for allegedly helping his cancer-stricken wife die
at a motel. A Hemlock Society spokesman said the family flew to
Michigan after learning of the Adkins case.
   Cooper said Adkins would not have qualified for aid-in-dying
under the measure, because she was not terminally ill by its
definition.
   ``This initiative does not in any way address or solve a lot of
problems in the world. It addresses the needs of two groups of
patients _ individuals in permanent vegetative state and with no
chance of recovery and those who are terminally ill who are
mentally competent to make those decisions,'' she said.
   The Eugene, Ore.-based National Hemlock Society, a leading
right-to-die group, is one of the main backers of the initiative,
which has been endorsed by the state's Democratic Party.
   The initiative has been condemned by the Roman Catholic Church,
and the Republican Party platform is against the initiative.
   ``Asking doctors to kill undermines the moral integrity and
confidence in a profession that heals, comforts and protects
life,'' Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen and Coadjutor Archbishop
Thomas Murphy of Seattle said in a statement issued as the
initiative campaign began.
   The Seattle-based law firm Perkins Coie, which conducted a
limited review of the measure, concluded it would hold up in court
for physicians assisting suicides under the specified conditions.
   The measure states that anyone forging or concealing revocation
of an aid-in-dying directive could be charged with first-degree
murder.
   In 1988 Californians tried to get a similar initiative on the
ballot and failed. Fresh attempts are being made in California,
Oregon and Florida, organizers said.
   Initiative 119 is an initiative to the Legislature. The
Legislature could pass it into law or propose an alternative, in
which case the original initiative and the alternate would go on
the 1991 ballot. If the Legislature did nothing, the initiative
would automatically go on the 1991 ballot.

   The waitresses at Fisher's Restaurant
balance heaping plates of food on their arms and weave through
dozens of tables to provide fast service to their customers.
   Pretty routine for a busy restaurant on a large boulevard in
Philadelphia. What is unusual is that many of those efficient
servers are eligible for retirement benefits.
   Of the restaurant's 16 ``floor people,'' more than half are 65
or older, with many averaging more than 20 years at Fisher's.
   Some can't perform at the levels they did years ago. Others need
to sit and rest more often. And schedules are juggled to handle
doctor visits.
   Owner Miles Fisher Jr. wouldn't have it any other way.
   ``After so many years, it's not fair to say, `You're retired
now.' So I made it a policy that as long as a person wanted to
work, I'd try to accommodate them,'' he said.
   The workers know the rules. ``You slow up, Miles gives you what
you can handle,'' said hostess Marcia Orlando. ``He'd never fire
you because you got too old to handle a full shift. Maybe he'll
only give you two tables.''
   Pantry worker Muriel Zappile, 65, is a good example, Orlando
said. ``She's got bad legs. So we let her go as she can. Six or
seven hours. Then she goes rest.''
   Or 76-year-old Eleanor Creech, who is on sick leave after
doctors replaced her arthritic leg with an artificial one.
   ``She just came in to pick up some back pay,'' Orlando said.
``She's hobbling around and can't wait to get back to work.''
   Creech has put in 25 years at the restaurant, and can have as
many more years as she wants, Fisher said. If she can't wait on
tables, she'll answer phones or help prepare menus.
   Dorothy Saybolt, an 18-year veteran, went to Fisher with a
different problem. The 66-year-old could work only so many hours
before the government would cut her Social Security benefits.
   ``Now I only work 18 to 20 hours a week. He lets me go home
then,'' she said.
   Several older workers came to the restaurant in recent years,
grateful that someone would give them work.
   Pat Dolan worked at a luncheonette for years before the pace
became too much in the early 1980s. Her employers told her that if
she couldn't handle the job, she should look elsewhere.
   Busboy Paul Irlan, 61, had been a painter for many years, but
the work became too exhausting and he began looking for a less
strenuous job.
   Interviews almost broke his spirit. ``I lost some jobs to
younger guys,'' he said.
   ``When I came here for a job, I walked in and saw two young guys
applying, so I just turned to leave. I figured there was no way
they'd hire me.''
   Fisher saw Irlan leaving and caught up with him at the door.
``He said, `You might be what I need.' So I gave it a try,'' Irlan
said.
   ``He's great,'' Orlando said. ``We hired a young guy at the same
time, but Paul ran circles around him.''
   Fisher said re-arranging schedules is worth the effort because
older workers tend to be more reliable.
   ``They become used to what the job is _ so the devotion to the
job is higher,'' he said. ``They know the operation and can jump in
anywhere they are needed.''
   Other companies are coming around to the same attitude.
   Overall, 153,000 Pennsylvania residents over 65 were working as
of 1988, the latest figures available, said John Velis of the U.S.
Bureau of Labor. He said an additional 3,000 senior citizens of the
state's 1.76 million over-65 population were job-hunting.
   The waitresses at Fisher's say growing up during the Great
Depression has given them a dedication to work that young people
just don't have.
   Students from nearby Temple University apply at Fisher's
regularly, but few stay longer than a month.
   ``The young girls can't come in and work like we do,'' said
70-year-old Mary Bear, who came to Fisher's in 1943. ``They like
money but they don't want to work.''

<HEAD>Alzheimer's Care: `A Maze of Blind Alleys'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For millions of Americans, the onset of
Alzheimer's disease opens a frustrating and sometimes fruitless
search for long-term care and services, a congressional agency
reports.
   Congress' Office of Technology Assessment concludes that as
America's population ages, a nationwide system is urgently needed
to link people with the debilitating disease with services they
need and can afford.
   The report, ``Confused Minds, Burdened Families, Finding Help
for People with Alzheimer's and other Dementias,'' estimates about
1.8 million people in the United States have dementia so severe
that others must care for them continually.
   An additional 1 million to 5 million have mild or moderate
dementia.
   Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia progressively destroy
memory and a person's ability to deal with and understand events
and people, to accomplish routine household chores or even to take
care of oneself.
   The report noted that many people eventually require total care,
24 hours a day for the rest of their lives.
   And that poses a problem for the families who must care for them.
   The congressional study quoted a Wisconsin Alzheimer's task
force as reporting:
   ``Alzheimer's family members often tell distressing stories
about not knowing where to go for help, going from one service
provider to another in a vain search for assistance, and being
misinformed about the availability of services or eligibility for
programs.''
   ``Families don't even know what to ask for and many go through a
maze of blind alleys before help is obtained,'' an adult day care
provider told the Maryland task force.
   The congressional agency concluded that while the need to
develop an effective system to link those suffering from
Alzheimer's to the services they need may seem removed from the
ravages of the disease itself, it is far from an abstract concern.
   Calling existing services ``complex and fragmented,'' the report
said:
   ``The need for such a system comes alive for people who try to
find appropriate services for a relative or friend . . . and
confront the existing lack of accurate information about services .
. . and the often bewildering array of public and private agencies,
individuals, funding sources, eligibility criteria, rules and
regulations that constitute the service environment.''
   It said establishing such a system will be difficult because of
the competing web of service providers.
   But it said that without such a system many people simply will
not get the care they need.
   And families and others, ``who already must bear the physical
and emotional demands of caregiving, will continue to experience
the frustration of not being able to obtain accurate information
and assistance in locating and arranging services,'' it said.
   The agency said any linking system should include education, an
information and referral network, outreach efforts and case
management and recommended it have these other characteristics:
   _ Be easily identifiable nationwide by using a common name or
logo or telephone number.
   _ Be available throughout a patient's illness.
   _ Be able to help care givers who live a distance from the
patient.
   _ Make available full information about available services and
sources of financing.
   Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., chairman of the Senate subcommittee
on aging, said the report underscores ``the heroic yet staggering
burdens facing care givers.''
   He noted Congress will consider adjustments in the Older
Americans Act next year and said that presents an opportunity to
address the problem.
   ``Families shouldn't have to go begging for help in caring for
loved ones with Alzheimer's disease,'' said Sen. Howard Metzenbaum,
D-Ohio, chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee.
``This report shows we must redouble our efforts to fill the gaps
in our health care system.''

<BYLINE>Aging Population Poses New Problems for Spain
^By BEN STOCKING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fernando Carrillo vows he will never end up
in a nursing home.
   ``Families should live together,'' said the 78-year-old retired
military man who shares an apartment in the Spanish capital with
his 46-year-old daughter. ``It must be sad to have your kids send
you off to live in exile in a place like that.''
   Carrillo's feelings are shared by the dozens of elderly
Spaniards playing cards, chatting or sharing a beer in the sunny
patio of the neighborhood senior citizen community center.
   But as the country's population of 39 million ages rapidly,
fewer and fewer elderly Spaniards will be able to live with their
children, the traditional way of dealing with aging in most Spanish
families.
   This is just one of the changes resulting from the acceleration
of the graying of Spanish society, according to doctors and
activists who work with the elderly.
   They say more nursing homes will be needed, the health care
system will have to adapt, and new programs will have to be
developed to help the elderly live independently as long as they
can.
   According to official statistics, 5 million Spaniards are 65 or
older, up from 4.6 million four years ago. That is projected to
rise to 6.1 million by 2000.
   As their numbers grow, Spanish senior citizens are beginning to
unite to fight for their interests.
   In 1988, they formed the Council for the Elderly, banding
together dozens of small groups with a combined membership of more
than 1 million.
   The rapid aging of Spain's population is partly due to medical
advances that have extended life-expectancy around the world.
   But it is also the result of two peculiarly Spanish events: the
1936-39 civil war and the end of the dictatorship of Gen. Francisco
Franco in 1975.
   Because an estimated 1 million people died in the war and its
aftermath of reprisals, the current generation of senior citizens
is smaller than it would have been otherwise.
   As the remaining members of the war generation die, and as the
members of the larger, postwar generation become senior citizens,
the elderly population will continue growing.
   In 1970, the death rate was 8.41 per 1,000 people. In 1986, the
last year for which comprehensive statistics are available, it had
fallen to 8.04.
   Meanwhile, the birthrate has been falling dramatically, from
19.55 per 1,000 residents in 1970 to 11.37 per 1,000 in 1986.
   The Roman Catholic Church wielded great influence during the
Franco years, and couples were encouraged to have large families.
But since the restoration of democracy in 1977, the influence of
the church has waned, and families are having fewer children.
   ``In the last 10 years, Spain has changed as much as a normal
country changes in 30,'' said Juan Manuel Martinez Gomez, secretary
general of the Spanish Society of Geriatrics and Gerontology.
   Manuela Jimenez Carrera, director of a small, private residence
in Madrid that is home to nine elderly women, said more and more
women are working outside the home and no longer have time to care
for their elderly parents as they did in the past.
   Francisco Verdu, president of the Council for the Elderly, said
a lack of housing is one of the most serious problems facing
Spain's elderly.
   According to the Ministry of Social Affairs, 24,000 people are
on waiting lists for public housing for the elderly. The problem is
expected to worsen, and the ministry estimates 107,000 nursing home
or group residency beds will be needed in the year 2000.
   Ministry officials say that the government will not be able to
build enough housing to meet demand and that some of the new beds
will have to be built by the private sector.
   But critics say the government needs to tighten regulation of
private nursing homes that are often nothing more than hotels,
ill-equipped to meet medical, dietary and psychological needs of
senior citizens.
   Spaniards were shocked recently by television images of
malnourished elderly women covered with bedsores being removed from
a private Barcelona nursing home shut down following complaints
from relatives of the residents.
   According to Martinez Gomez of the Spanish Society of Geriatrics
and Gerontology, Spain has no more than 100 specialists in
geriatric medicine, which has only been offered in medical school
since 1978.
   ``We are far, far below where we should be,'' he said.
   Complicating the problem, Verdu said, is the tendency of elderly
Spaniards to swallow pills on their own because there is not
sufficient control of the over-the-counter sale of drugs.

<TEXT>
   As Spain's population rapidly grows older,
one of the country's most serious medical problems will be
Alzheimer's disease. Few people here know much about it.
   ``There's very little practical information for families to
explain how to deal with the problem,'' said Manuel Martinez Gomez,
secretary general of the Spanish Society for Geriatrics and
Gerontology.
   He said 250,000 to 300,000 Spaniards now suffer from Alzheimer's
disease.
   And with Spain's older population expected to increase 20
percent to 6.1 million by the year 2,000, the number of victims is
likely to follow the curve.
   Alzheimer's disease was discovered in 1906 by Alois Alzheimer, a
German neuropathologist. It is a progressive brain disorder that
causes the slow deterioration of the victim's mind. It causes
changes in the nerve cells in the brain and usually results in
death within two to 20 years.
   There is still no cure for the disease, and the cause is unknown.
   It results in severe memory loss, confusion, inability to
perform routine tasks, personality changes and, eventually, total
physical and mental incapacity.
   Martinez Gomez said he knew of no medical centers in Spain that
specialize in treating Alzheimer's patients, most of whom are cared
for at home.

   People over age 65 make up 13 percent of
the American population, yet they take 30 percent of all
prescription medicines sold in this country.
   One billion times each year, Americans 65 or older take
over-the-counter drugs. While these medicines offer many benefits,
they carry some risks.
   Almost everyone has a favorite story about the number of pills,
potions or elixirs taken by an older relative or friend. While most
of these stories have a happy ending, some do not. When taking any
medication, caution and common sense are necessary.
   Some basic rules for safe use of medicine:
   _ Take exactly the amount your doctor prescribes and follow the
dosage schedule as closely as possible. Contact your doctor or
pharmacist immediately if you have unusual reactions to medications.
   _ Make sure to ask your doctor for the specific name of the
medicine prescribed. Ask why the drug is necessary, how long the
drug will have to be taken, and if there is a good generic
substitute.
   _ Tell your doctor about all other medicines (prescription and
over the counter) you are taking. Interactions between medications
can cause serious complications.
   _ Keep a daily log. It should include the name of the medicine,
the doctor who prescribed it, and the schedule for taking it.
Include a space to check off each dose.
   _ Be sure to tell your doctor about past problems _ such as
rashes, indigestion, dizziness, lack of appetite _ that occurred
when you took other medicines.
   _ Be sure to ask your doctor about side effects, the best way to
store the medicine, and any special rules _ for example, should the
medicine be taken with foods or beverages, should you limit your
activities while taking the medicine.
   _ Make sure the directions printed on the medicine container are
clear. Ask the pharmicist to use easy-to-open containers if
child-proof ones are hard to handle. The pharmacist can use large
type on the label to help people with vision problems.
   _ Do not ``share'' your medicines with friends or relatives; do
not save medicines for use at another time.
   _ Do not stop taking a medicine prescribed by your doctor
suddenly _ even if the symptoms go away.
   _ Ask your doctor from time to time to review the medications
you take. New information about medicines and how they affect older
people is coming to light daily.

Evaluation and Research, Consumer and Professional Affairs
(HFD-365) _ 5000 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Md., 20857, 301-295-801 _
will provide information on specific drugs and their side effects.
   Keep in mind that a chemical agent strong enough to cure an
ailment is also strong enough to cause harm if not used wisely.
Although people should never stop taking medecine without medical
advice, if a drug seems to be causing more harm then good, don't be
afraid to discuss the matter with your doctor. She or he may be
able to prescribe a different drug that will be just as effective.

<HEAD>Budgeting Takes Planning But Is Not Impossible</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CYNTHIA E. FORMAN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Think of a budget as a forecast, a measure, an
estimate, a plan, a projection, or cash flow management.
   Budgeting is a balancing act that requires planning and goal
setting. In the simplest sense, budgeting involves matching your
outflow with your income in timing and amounts. Successful cash
flow management is based on being aware of the unique pattern of
inflows and outflows that make up your financial life.
   For most people, it's relatively easy to list the sources,
amounts and timing of income. Because income usually does not
fluctuate from month to month, the main challenge for salaried
employees is to gather and analyze information about the outflow
categories.
   If your income is erratic, say you are in sales and on
commission, you'll encounter difficulty projecting and matching
inflows for the coming year. Use your earning history and your
plans for the present year as your guide. Even though your income
fluctuates, you can still focus on patterns emerging over time.
   Tracking where your money goes will be your next step. Refer to
your checkbook registers, receipts, statements, tax returns and
floppy disks.
   Unless you inadvertently hide the nature of all your
transactions by writing checks to ``cash'' and using automatic
teller machines for cash advances, you should have some kind of
financial records.
   If the task of determining where your money goes seems
overwhelming at first, paint the picture in broad strokes. Develop
amounts for expense categories, i.e. housing, meals, auto, etc.
   If you find that you have to guess at most categories, even
after gathering all the records you have, you'll have to conduct an
experiment in which you observe your spending habits.
   Keep a spending journal. For three to four months, keep track of
all the money you spend. Yes, that means tallying up amounts for
coffee and doughnuts, magazines for plane trips, new windshield
wipers, and gadgets from the hardware store.
   Before you throw your hands up in dismay, realize that you are
not alone. Very few people can accurately quote the amounts they
spend on clothing, taxis, lunches, pet care, hobbies, household
supplies and other items.
   Your goal is to develop a list of monthly expenses. You will
discover some expenditures occur every month and are relatively
fixed. Others will vary in amount and-or timing.
   Budgeting involves matching your income with your outflow. When
there is a mismatch (i.e., the outflows are projected to exceed the
inflows), you can (1) build up an adequate cash reserve to cover
those times, (2) modify the timing of the inflows or outflows, (3)
increase the size of the inflows, and-or (4) reduce the size of the
outflows.
   _ Build an emergency reserve. It is important to build up a cash
cushion of at least six months' worth of expenses. As with every
rule of thumb, there are exceptions.
   For example, if you are able to cover the critical monthly
living expenses from another income source, you might consider a
smaller reserve. However, the best preparation for a financial
pinch is an adequate reserve. When outflow requirements exceed
inflow available, all you'll need to do is dip into the reserve.
   _ Modify the timing of inflows or outflows. Keep your money in
an interest-bearing account and pay bills close to due dates. If
necessary, contact creditors to rescedule payments. They may allow
you to miss a few payments or stretch the time over which you make
the payments.
   Unless you are in control of how you use your credit cards, you
might want to make all purchases by cash or check. However,
judicious use of credit can allow you to delay making payments.
   It's a good idea to pay for existing purchases before going into
debt for new items. And, instead of making only the minimum
payments required by the company, make the payment larger to take
care of interest and reduction of principal.
   _ Increase inflows. To do this, you can liquidate assets or
borrow money. In extremely tight situations, you can rent out a
room in your house or find ways to earn extra money.
   Depending on your mindset, borrowing may be a workable option.
Some financial planners say you should always try to borrow against
assets before selling off those assets. Disrupting your investment
program by selling valuable assets may not be in your best
interest. Also, borrowing will result in yet another fixed outflow.
   _ Reduce outflows. Reduce certain outflows until the financial
crunch subsides. Wherever an outflow is variable, determine how you
can reduce the outflow. Consider the pros and cons of refinancing
an expensive mortgage.
   Cut back on magazine subscriptions or decrease spending on
gifts. Modify plans for wardrobe purchases; take care of the lawn
yourself.
   Finally, if necessary, set your survival standard of living and
stick to it. When the financial crisis passes, don't automatically
return to your previous standard; instead, increase your emergency
reserve first. Even when your income increases, resist the urge to
immediately upgrade your standard of living.
   As the motto says, ``Plan Ahead.'' Start today, so you'll be
able to take control of your financial life through cash flow
management.

<HEAD>Beans Offer Variety, and Don't Require Much Savvy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE BRIA</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>POUND RIDGE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A gardener feeling jaded might get a
lift with a different bean _ go French, perhaps, with filets and
flageolets. Countless varieties exist of this ancient food plant of
the Aztecs and Incas. And breeders keep creating new ones.
   Next year's catalogs, for example, will introduce a pole bean
called ``Kentucky Blue.'' Winner of an All America Selections
Award, the new bean combines traits of two already superb pole
beans, ``Kentucky Wonder'' and ``Blue Lake'' _ something like
crossing a Mercedes with a Cadillac. The breeder was Calvin
Lamborn, an Idaho horticulturist who won a previous award for a
sugar snap pea.
   In 40 years of gardening, the most attractive bean I've met is a
super-slim Frenchie called ``haricot vert'' (ah-ree-co vair),
probably best known as ``filet bean.'' This sweet and tender bean
is as fussy as it is elegant. If you don't pick it at the right
moment _ when it's shoelace-thin and no seeds have formed _ the pod
toughens and the flavor goes ``off.'' A single day can make a
difference.
   A gourmet shell bean becoming popular in American gardens is the
flageolet (flah-joh-lay), celebrated in French cuisine as an
accompaniment to roast lamb. I've grown this tiny bean and admired
its taste and looks, but it takes a lot of them to make a meal.
   This year I grew soybeans for the first time. Of probably Asian
origin, the soy was practically unknown in America until Commodore
Matthew Perry brought some back from Japan in 1854. This shell bean
contains high-quality protein (and also some fat), but breeders
still are working to improve its flavor. In my garden a variety
called ``Butterbeans'' took 90 days to mature, producing small,
fuzzy pods _ about 2 inches long _ which were tough to pry open.
Inside were two to three seeds as green as peas. They kept their
nice color in cooking, but I found the taste on the bland side.
   The soy and another shell bean, the fava, known in Europe since
Homeric times, are the only beans of non-Amerindian heritage.
Unlike other beans, the fava withstands frost. Sown in mid-March,
it matures in June, the earliest bean in my southern New York
garden. The fava, also known as broad bean and Windsor bean, is
delicious raw. It's still a favorite of picnickers in Rome, where,
in ancient times, it gave its name to a prominent family, the
Fabii. But some people get an anemia called ``favism'' by eating
raw or partly cooked favas.
   Bean pods, of various shades of green, yellow and purple,
contain some vitamin C and A and their taste is a summer delight.
But it's the seeds that pack the protein. Hence the importance of
shell beans in the human diet _ they're meat substitutes. Meals of
beans and rice, beans and corn, or beans and pasta, combing
proteins and carbohydrates, are classic fare. Lima beans have been
found in Inca digs dating to 7000 B.C. In North America, the
colonists saw Indians growing corn and beans together, using the
cornstalks for the beans to climb on.
   You don't need much savvy to grow beans. Just be sure the soil
is thoroughly warm when you sow them or they'll rot. Climbing beans
need supports, of course, tripods being the best to resist high
wind.
   In this day of the freezer, a gardener can store fresh shell
beans, saving himself the labor of drying them. The fresh ones
taste better than the mealy-prone dry ones, I think, and they cook
much faster. Seeds keep excellently in the freezer, unlike pods,
which emerge from the ice limp and practically tasteless.
   A shell bean called ``Limelight'' gave me an abundant harvest in
early August of light green beans resembling baby limas in looks
and flavor. Each easy-to-shell pod contained six or seven seeds.
   Pole lima beans yield the biggest seeds of all _ some as large
as quarters _ and with a taste far superior to the dried ones.
Their long-maturing time makes them unfeasible for the coldest
parts of the country. In my borderline area, I push the season by
starting them indoors in pots, like tomatoes. By late May, when I
put them in the ground, they're sturdy plants. With favorable
weather, I begin harvesting these big limas late in August, more
than a month before frost.
   A helpful practice in growing limas is to sow the seeds with the
``eye'' _ the tiny notch _ facing down. This makes them germinate
easier. In crusty soil, some growers even leave the top of the seed
uncovered. I've had fine results with a variety of pole lima called
``King of the Garden,'' but now I'm ready to diversify. Next time
I'm planting highly recommended lima called ``Christmas.''

<HEAD>Maggie Kuhn Gets Award for Sticking Her Neck Out</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gray Panther founder Maggie Kuhn celebrated
her 85th birthday recently, and is living up to her lifelong pledge
of doing ``something outrageous'' at least once a day.
   ``Today, I'm sending a telegram to Mr. Bush about Kuwait,'' Ms.
Kuhn said last week. ``We should get the hell out of there.''
   The whole thing is over oil, she said.
   ``We have the wind and the sun. We don't need that messy
stuff,'' she said.
   ``And, oh, before I forget it, I'm writing another book. But I'm
not quite ready to discuss it. I'm meeting with the editors
tomorrow,'' she added in a quick change of pace that is
characteristic of the woman who started the Gray Panthers as a
voice for those not ready to give in to age. Ms. Kuhn turned 85 on
Aug. 3.
   For her work over the years, the New York-based Giraffe Society
recognized her as a member, one of the people who ``stick their
necks out.''
   Along with the recognition came some Ben and Jerry's ``light''
ice cream, a special award called the ``1,000 Pints of Lite,'' a
play on Bush's ``thousand points of light'' campaign.
   The truck that brought the ice cream from Vermont couldn't make
it the short way to Ms. Kuhn's Germantown home because of a low
railroad trestle. It did make it, however, and the neighborhood was
invited to eat and carry away all they could.
   ``There was rain and Ben and Jerry put up this enormous yellow
tent,'' Ms. Kuhn said in describing the giving away of the pints of
ice cream. ``We had a wonderful time.''

<HEAD>Visiting Nurses Get $1.5 Million Grant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government is awarding a $1.5 million
grant to the Visiting Nurse Association of America for a national
demonstration program in an effort to increase home health care to
frail older people.
   The association is seeking aid from foundations and corporations
to match the grant provided by ACTION, the federal domestic
volunteer agency.
   The project is intended to get the private sector involved in
helping people live independently.
   With the matching financing, the Visiting Nurse Association will
organize volunteer jobs for 200 senior citizens who will visit with
400 frail elderly and help them remain in their homes rather than
be moved to institutions.
   Known as Senior Companions, the program will provide the
low-income volunteers aged 60 and older with training, a small
allowance, reimbursement for transportation and meals, insurance
and an annual physical examination.
   The three-year project will be conducted in 18 communities
throughout the country. Locations are to be announced later.

<HEAD>Journal: Iacocca Boosts Cost-Cutting to $2.5 Billion, Up $1
Billion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. is adding a half year and $1
billion to its cost-cutting program, boosting the target to $2.5
billion by June 1991, Chairman Lee Iacocca says.
   Iacocca said in an interview in today's edition of The Wall
Street Journal that the company is near the $1.5 billion target set
for the end of this year. Without the cuts, Chrysler would not be
profitable, he said.
   Wall Street analysts and Chrysler officials expect the company
will post a substantial loss in the third quarter, mainly because
of an interruption of minivan production at two plants.
   During the first half of the year, Chrysler earned $251 million,
down 64 percent from last year.
   In October 1989, Chrysler began its cost-cutting program with an
initial target of $1 billion by the end of 1990. That was raised to
$1.5 billion, and now Iacocca says it will be $2.5 billion by next
June.
   ``If we can get $2.5 billion, I'll give our guys a lot of
credit,'' he told the Journal. ``The last $1 billion obviously gets
a little harder.''
   Also in the interview, Iacocca said:
   _ The company hoped to find ``a good European partner'' to help
with vehicle development and production, first probably with
minivans and Jeeps, Chrysler's two biggest moneymakers. Previously,
he acknowledged that Chrysler and the Italian industrial giant Fiat
SpA have been talking about a business deal.
   _ Former Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald's departure last May was
``a bit of an emotional jolt for me.'' He wanted Greenwald to
succeed him as chairman. Greenwald left Chrysler to head a
three-union bid to buy United Airlines.
   _ Chrysler will maintain its current 30-cents-a-share stock
dividend despite recent quarterly profits insufficient to cover the
payments.
   ``But all good companies go through some periods where they
don't earn the dividend but continue to pay it,'' Iacocca said.
Chrysler's $4.5 billion in cash reserves should remain largely
untouched unless the Mideast crisis escalates and new car and truck
sales plummet.

<TEXT>
   GTE Corp. has ended discussions with
Thorn EMI of Great Britain after being unable to agree on terms for
GTE's proposed purchase of the British company's lighting business,
GTE said.
   The discussions were initiated in May and at the time both
companies had said the worldwide demand for lamps and fixtures of
advanced technology required increasingly high levels of investment.
   The two companies had said the discussions were the result of a
growing pressure to cut costs by scaling down research and
development, manufacturing and marketing to develop strong
positions in the world's key lighting markets.
   GTE announced Monday in a brief statement that the talks had
ended.
   Thorn EMI, based in London, is an international company
operating in the music, light and technologies industries. It
generated sales of more than $5.1 billion in the year ended March
31, 1989.
   GTE is a telecommunications, lighting and precision materials
company based in Stamford. It had sales of $17.4 billion in 1989.

   Stock prices fell this morning as the market
worried about higher oil prices and another sign that the economy
is declining, analysts said.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was down 18.82

   Volume on the Big Board came to 33.06 million shares.
   Analysts said the market was concerned about the inflationary

   In one such sign, the National Association of Purchasing
Management said today its purchasing managers index declined in
August for the second consecutive month, to 47.0 percent from 47.4
percent in July. A reading below 50 indicates the manufacturing
sector of the economy generally is declining.

   Victor Lespinasse, an assistant vice president in the
grain-trading division of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., attributed
last week's across-the-board decline in grain prices to an easing
of inflation fears related to perceptions of a diminished threat of
war in the Middle East.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1\ cents to 3\ cents lower
with the contract for delivery in September at $2.59\ a bushel;
corn futures were unchanged to 1} cents lower with September at
$2.41{ a bushel; oats were { cent to 1} cents higher with September
at $1.06\ a bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents to 4 cents higher with
September at $6.02{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .07 cents to .33 cents higher with the contract
for delivery in October at 76.62 cents a pound; feeder cattle were
.12 cent lower to .15 cent higher with September at 86.65 cents a
pound; live hogs were .20 cent lower to .55 cent higher with
October at 48.85 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .10 cent
to .53 cent higher with February at 50.40 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures advanced Friday, the last trading day before the
three-day Labor Day weekend, and pork futures retreated.

<HEAD>Higher Mathematics: Buying and Selling in Nicaragua</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORALISA PILARTE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After surviving a decade of civil war,
Nicaraguans face inflation of 80 percent a month and three-tiered
pricing that turns a shopping trip into an exercise for number
crunchers.
   Many people tuck a calculator into purse or pocket before
leaving home.
   ``I have to think twice before going out to buy anything,'' said
Susana Montenegro, a middle-class housewife encountered in a
supermarket. ``And not just because everything is so expensive.
It's the conversions back and forth. They give me a headache.''
   A new currency, called the gold cordoba, and the rules governing
its value have made a confusing economy even more so.
   Gold cordobas officially trade at par with the dollar and are
supposed to replace the old cordobas, which Nicaraguans have
christened ``chancheros,'' or ``piggies,'' to set them apart from
the new ones.
   When Mrs. Montenegro buys a 5-pound bag of beans she can pay in
either gold cordobas or dollars and get change in piggies at the
official exchange rate, or she can pay the entire amount in piggies.
   Into her decision and calculations, she must factor the
principle that a piggy in hand should be a piggy spent quickly,
because it will buy less next week.
   Devaluations of the piggy, which occur each Monday, make last
week's black market rate this week's official exchange rate,
erasing what advantage there had been in trading with the
``coyotes'' who deal in currency. In response, the coyotes change
their own rate.
   Francisco Mayorga, president of the central bank, hailed the
gold cordoba as the cornerstone of the economic revival promised by
the new government, but it has been a mild flop.
   Only $4 million worth have been released into the market since
the gold cordoba's debut Aug. 13, about 5 percent of the total
money in circulation, and much of that is back in the bank vaults.
   Few people use the gold cordoba. Suspicious consumers prefer
dollars, or even piggies, although 900,000 of them were needed to
buy a dollar at the end of August.
   The government says it will issue only as many gold cordobas as
it has dollars to back them up.
   Official parity remains in effect, but real parity began
dissolving when the government stores that sell foreign goods only
for dollars added a 1 percent charge for anyone paying with gold
cordobas.
   Coyotes won't touch the new currency.
   ``Most people who buy dollars from me are merchants who go to
Honduras and Guatemala to buy, and the gold cordobas are not
accepted over there,'' said one, who would not give his name. ``The
dollar is the dollar anywhere. The gold cordoba is something that
only Panchito (Mayorga) likes.''
   Public employees, who received 50 gold cordobas each as part of
their pay, can use them to pay utility bills, which are higher now
that subsidies have been ended.
   Restaurants, supermarkets and other businesses have converted
prices to gold cordobas, but accept piggies at the official rate
and dollars.
   To cope with the rising cost of living, people usually change
their gold cordobas at banks for dollars and trade the dollars for
piggies with street-corner coyotes, who pay about 10 percent above
the official rate.
   Mrs. Montenegro tries to keep up with exchange rates because
there have been 40 devaluations this year, 33 of them under
President Violeta Chamorro's government since it succeeded the
Sandinistas four months ago.
   If she receives dollars from relatives in the United States, as
many Nicaraguans do, she is better off changing them on the black
market and paying bills in piggies.
   Many Nicaraguans feel the higher rate on the black market
offsets the risk of a police raid during the transaction.

<HEAD>Foreign TV Unwelcome Intrusion in Parts of Asia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Asian governments that want to control what
their people see on television are fighting a losing battle with
satellites and receiving dishes.
   Direct broadcasts from foreign countries into private homes via
satellite are spreading rapidly.
   Some officials fret over the impact on their people's values and
way of life. Western diplomats say others fear their social and
political control might be questioned if citizens have wider
freedom of choice.
   Ever smaller and cheaper receiving dishes and the launch of a
major telecommunications satellite make it increasingly difficult
for governments to deny viewers direct access to foreign television.
   ``We may not be able to check foreign TV intruding into our
lives for much longer,'' Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore
said in 1988, but he has done a pretty good job so far.
   The only known satellite-reception dish not in his government's
hands that is capable of receiving foreign programs sits on the
roof of the U.S. Embassy. Installation was permitted ``strictly for
embassy use'' two years after an application was filed.
   Others in this prosperous city-state are prohibited by law from
owning or selling such dishes, except for export. Foreign programs
for the three Singapore Broadcasting Corp. channels are screened to
``filter out unacceptable and harmful values and lifestyles,'' said
communications official Mah Bow Tan.
   One official said full access to foreign TV shows, permissive
American offerings especially, could harm a young nation composed
of different races, religions and cultures. He said censorship of
foreign movies, magazines and TV was necessary to repel cultural
subversion.
   Not everyone agrees. Lim Boon Heng, a member of Parliament, said
the government should consider broadcasting to the surrounding
region by satellite and stop trying to control the use of receiving
dishes.
   Compact new receivers are small enough to fit into a suitcase,
and Lim said: ``When dishes get to that size, the authorities will
have a hard time to control the use of satellite receivers . . . so
why fight it?''
   A major enemy in this information war is positioned slightly to
the east and 22,753 miles up. AsiaSat-1 was launched from China in
April by a Long March III rocket and is in orbit near the Equator.
   Telecommunications satellites are not new to the region.
Indonesia was the first country in Asia and third in the world,
after Canada and the United States, to have a domestic satellite.
Japan and Australia also have communications satellites.
   AsiaSat-1, the first privately owned satellite, has the
potential to beam signals to and from the Middle East, Singapore
and Tokyo, and could offer a dozen new channels to an area with
more than 2 billion potential viewers. The owner is a consortium
led by Hutchison Whampoa (Holdings) Ltd. and based in Hong Kong.
   In Indonesia alone, where reception from the government's Palapa
series of satellites was established in 1976, an estimated 25,000
dishes can pick up AsiaSat-1.
   Hong Kong officials announced in early August that individuals
could own and operate dishes for personal use without licenses,
lifting a ban that had been widely ignored for years. Broadcasters
and operators of dishes that serve more than one viewer must have
licenses.
   Elsewhere, the picture is equally mixed.
   Satellite dishes are legal in the Philippines upon approval of
an application, but few applications are approved. Those who can
afford it put them up anyway, apparently assuming the government
has more important rules to enforce.
   Direct reception of satellite television still is forbidden in
Thailand, which maintains close control over telecommunications,
but pressure against the policy is increasing.
   ``We cannot stop technologies from growing,'' Joompol Rodcumdee
of Chulalongkorn University in Thailand told a regional seminar on
the socio-economic impact of broadcast satellites.
   ``Today we may say we will not use them, but tomorrow we may not
be able to get away from them,'' he said.
   Vijay Menon, secretary-general of the Asian Mass Communication
Research and Information Center, said the estimated 150,000
satellite dishes in South Korea were ``not viewed as a blessing or
even as a sign of progress.''
   ``Journalism professors have been filling local newspapers with
letters denouncing the impact of foreign TV on Korean society,'' he
said. ``Foreign programs, they feel, are making viewers in Korea
adopt alien ways of thinking, life and customs and deepening the
dependency of Korea on alien culture.''
   Malaysia bans private satellites for direct TV reception, and
Madzhi Johari of the government broadcast training institute said:
``Direct access to broadcasting satellites means direct import of
norms and values of the developed countries and will result in
stress and conflict in our society.'' Indonesians seem relaxed
about the impact of numerous private dishes, which fall into a
legal no-man's land, neither permitted nor forbidden.
   ``There is no need to be alarmed over the possible unfavorable
consequences, be they cultural, political or economic,'' said a
senior executive at TVRI, the government network.
   Diplomats in Jakarta attribute the lack of concern to the fact
that most foreign programs are in English or other languages
relatively few Indonesians understand.

<HEAD>Manufacturing Economy Slows Again, Purchasing Managers Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The manufacturing sector of the economy slowed
during August for the second straight month as production and new
orders dropped, according to a survey of purchasing executives
across the country.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management, which tracks
the manufacturing economy through a monthly poll of its members,
said its overall index of business activity fell to 47.0 percent
from 47.4 percent in July. When the index registers below 50
percent, it indicates the economy is weakening.
   The drop in the index was the second consecutive decline. The
index stood at 51.1 percent in June.
   News of the purchasing managers report contributed to a decline
in the stock market. At 11:30 a.m. EDT, the Dow Jones industrial
average was off 16.59 at 2,597.77.
   The purchasing managers reported a drop in production, the first
in seven months, and attributed the slowdown to a sharp drop in new
orders in July.
   Twenty percent of the purchasing managers said production was up
in August, while 54 percent reported it was unchanged and 26
percent said it was down. That compared with 19 percent reporting
higher production in July, 58 percent reporting it was unchanged
that month and 23 percent saying it had slowed.
   Meanwhile, new orders dropped for the second straight month.
   Twenty-one percent of the purchasing managers said new orders
rose during August, while 49 percent reported they were stable and
30 percent reported they had declined. In July, 19 percent reported
growth in new orders, 53 percent reported they were the same and 28
percent said they had declined.
   Export orders also dropped. Sixteen percent of the purchasing
managers said new export orders were up, while 74 percent said they
were the same and 10 percent said they were down. The previous
month, 24 percent said they were up, 66 said they were the same and
10 percent said they were down.
   Imports declined, with 7 percent of the respondents reporting an
increase in imports, 81 percent reporting they were the same and 12
percent reporting a decline. In July, 9 percent reported imports
were up, 78 percent said they were the same and 13 percent said
they were lower.
   Prices for raw materials rose during August, a reflection of
higher energy prices resulting from the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Twenty-two percent of the purchasing managers said they were
paying higher prices, 68 percent said they were paying the same
amount, and 10 percent said prices were down. That compared with 12
percent reporting higher prices in July, 77 reporting stable prices
and 11 percent reporting lower prices.
   Employment fell for the 18th straight month during August and at
a slightly faster rate than in July.
   Nine percent of the purchasing executives said employment was up
at their companies, 68 percent said it was the same and 23 percent
said it was down. In July, 13 percent said employment was up, 70
percent said it was the same and 17 percent reported a decline.
   Supplier deliveries slowed in August, a sign of some economic
strength as it indicated companies had more orders than they could
fill.
   Seven percent of the purchasing managers surveyed said supplier
deliveries were slower, 87 percent reported they were the same, and
6 percent said they were faster. That compared with 6 percent who
said they were slower in July, 83 percent who said they were the
same and 11 percent who said they were faster.
   Inventories continued to decline in August, but at a slowing
pace.
   Sixteen percent of the respondents said their inventories were
larger, 57 percent said they were stable and 27 percent said they
declined. In July, 10 percent reported they were up, 55 percent
reported they were the same and 35 percent said they were down.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management is a research
and education organization with more than 33,000 members. Its
monthly survey queries purchasing executives at more than 300
industrial companies across the nation.

   PacifiCorp is dropping its pursuit of Pinnacle
West Capital Corp. but is getting the power exchange it wants.
   PacifiCorp, an electric utility based in Portland, Ore., has
been trying to buy either Pinnacle West or its Arizona Public
Service Co. subsidiary for several months. Pinnacle West, based in
Phoenix, has rejected several offers.
   On Friday, the companies announced an agreement that allows
PacifiCorp to buy part of the Cholla power plant and exchange power
during the utilities' differing peak use seasons.
   Under the agreement, PacifiCorp, at an initial cost of $220
million, will buy part of the Cholla plant and other facilities.
The total cost may reach $260 million, Pinnacle West Chairman
Richard Snell said Friday.
   PacifiCorp said it would cease attempts to acquire APS or
Pinnacle West.
   ``We wanted the merger, but this is the next best thing,'' said
Al Gleason, president and chief executive of PacifiCorp. ``The
primary reason we went into this was for the power system benefit.
   The agreement is contingent upon approval of the companies'
boards and regulatory agencies.

   Stock prices dropped sharply today as the market
worried about higher oil prices and another sign that the economy
is declining, analysts said.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was down 27.48
points to 2,586.88 as of noon on Wall Street.
   In the broader market, declining stocks outnumbered advancing
ones more than 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 400 up,
912 down and 447 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to a light 47.65
million shares at midday.
   Analysts said the market was concerned about the inflationary
effect of higher oil prices. The October contract for crude was up
$1.51 to $28.83 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange
shortly before noon EDT.
   Investors also were troubled by weakness in overseas stock
markets and signs that the U.S. economy is continuing to slow, said
Thomas R. Walsh, head of equity trading at Nikko Securities Co.
International Inc. in New York.
   In one such sign, the National Association of Purchasing
Management said today its purchasing managers index declined in
August for the second consecutive month, to 47.0 percent from 47.4
percent in July. A reading below 50 indicates the manufacturing
sector of the economy generally is declining.
   Walsh said the market's slide was exaggerated by the low trading
volume following the three-day weekend.
   ``A lot of decision-makers aren't back yet,'' he said.
   Continuing pessimism over the Middle East sent prices plummeting
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which fell 557.94 points Monday, shed 512.79 more
points, or 2.20 percent, closing at 24,907.64. Prices also were
lower on the London Stock Exchange.
   Among most-active blue chip issues on the NYSE, Boeing fell &lsqb; to
48&lsqb;, General Electric slipped 1&lsqb; to 60~, Philip Morris fell &rsqb; to
44} and IBM was down { at 101&rsqb;.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.40 to 175.57. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index slipped 1.69 to 321.70.

   Chrysler Corp. on Monday again
extended the life of its carmaking plant in St. Louis, putting off
the scheduled closing until late May 1991.
   There are about 2,300 hourly and salaried workers at the
factory, which makes Chrysler LeBaron coupe and convertible and
Dodge Daytona cars. Chrysler also operates a minivan assembly plant
in St. Louis.
   The life of the St. Louis plant now has been extended twice.
Originally, the plant was to close Sept. 21. That date was later
pushed back to Nov. 9.
   Chrysler said the extension of the St. Louis car plant's life
until May 24 gives added production time for its Newark, Del., and
Sterling Heights, Mich., plants. The two plants were to get the St.
Louis factory's products.
   The company also said the extension would allow the Newark
factory to increase production of Dodge Spirit and Plymouth Acclaim
cars for fleet and retail sales. Sterling Heights would have more
time for added production of an America series of Dodge Shadow and
Plymouth Sundance entry-level cars.

   The federal bank fraud trial of former thrift

February, federal court officials said Tuesday.
   The trial was to start Tuesday for McBirney, who was indicted in
July on 17 counts of bank fraud, misapplication of funds, making
false entries and making false statements.
   McBirney, 37, has pleaded innocent and is free on his own
recognizance.
   No new trial date has been set, U.S. District Judge Robert
Maloney's office said.
   The indictment accuses McBirney, former chairman of Sunbelt
Savings Association of Texas, of promising another thrift a $6
million profit on one transaction in return for help in financing a
$700 million real estate deal in California.
   Investigators say the deal was one of the reasons Dallas-based
Sunbelt failed in 1986, starting a bailout regulators estimate will
cost $2 billion.
   He faces up to 85 years in prison and a fine of $4.5 million if
convicted.

<HEAD>EDS, New Century To Acquire Westwood Equities Corp.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Electronic Data Systems Corp. has reached
agreement with an affiliate of the billionaire Pritzker family to
acquire Westwood Equities Corp., whose holdings include one of the
nation's largest title insurance companies, it was announced
Tuesday.
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
   EDS said it reached an agreement in principle with New Century
Enterprises Inc. to acquire Westwood, owner of the Ticor Title
Insurance Cos. of California.
   New Century was described as an affiliate of Pritzker family
interests. Fortune magazine recently estimated the wealth of the
Chicago-based Pritzker family at $4.5 billion, including the Hyatt
Corp. hotel and resort chain.
   Ticor Title Insurance employs 4,500 employees in 348 offices
nationwide. Ticor Realty Tax Services is the nation's second
largest provider of tax reporting services on mortgaged property.
   Westwood and both Ticor companies are headquartered in Los
Angeles.
   Ticor Title has been hurt by real estate problems associated
with the savings and loan crisis. In 1988, the holding company also
liquidated a mortgage insurance unit that had become insolvent.
   Under a separate agreement, EDS will furnish all information
technology services to Westwood's corporate and operating
subsidiaries, the news release said.
   ``EDS is pleased to be working together with the Pritzkers.
Their distinguished record of success in managing and growing
businesses makes them the ideal partner for this transaction,''
said EDS chairman, president and chief executive officer Les
Alberthal.
   ``This relationship is exactly what Ticor needs to promote its
subsidiaries' service capabilities into the next century,'' said
Winston Morrow, president of Westwood Equities.
   The acquisition is subject to satisfactory financing
arrangements, and the approval by creditor banks, state and
financial regulators and shareholders.

<TEXT>
   Hewlett-Packard Co. said Tuesday it has
reduced its U.S. list prices on three of its Vectra personal
computers by up to 24 percent because of lower manufacturing costs.
   The reductions on the HP Vectra 486, HP Vectra RS@25C and HP
Vectra QS@20, ranging from $300 to $4,600, took effect Saturday.
   Hewlett-Packard, an international manufacturer of measurement
and computation products and systems, also cut the prices of the
330MB and 670MB enhanced small-device interface (ESDI) disk drives.
   ``Recent price declines were driven by lower manufacturing costs
for the high-performance ESDI hard-disk drives and by lower costs
for components, including memory,'' said Pradeep Jotwani, the
company's North American PC marketing manager.
   The HP Vectra 486 PC is the most powerful model in the Vectra
group and is used for computer-aided design, multi-user computing
and local-area-network server applications.
   Previous prices for the HP Vectra 486 ranged from $10,499 to
$19,499; new prices range from $8,999 to $14,899.
   Price ranges for the HP Vectra RS@25C, a deskside model intended
for the same markets, were reduced from $7,349-$12,499 to
$6,299-$11,699. Price ranges for the HP Vectra QS@20, designed for
desktop publishing and office applications, dropped from
$3,499-$8,399 to $3,199-$5,299.

<TEXT>
   The federal Environmental Protection
Agency on Tuesday charged United Technologies Corp. with failing to
comply with federal laws on the management of hazardous waste at
six production plants.
   The EPA said inspections of five Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft
manufacturing plants and one Hamilton Standard plant revealed more
than 100 violations of the federal law that mandates
cradle-to-grave management of hazardous waste.
   The alleged violations include improper handling of hazardous
waste, storage of hazardous waste without a permit, inadequate
record keeping, inadequate training of personnel, and inadequate
monitoring of groundwater.
   In addition, the EPA said UTC violated the terms of a 1989
consent agreement it had entered into with EPA.
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Hartford, seeks a
court order forcing UTC to comply with environmental laws and
unspecified fines.
   ``It's the number of violations, as opposed to the severity,
that we're concerned with,'' said U.S. Attorney Stanley A. Twardy,
who filed the civil suit on behalf of the EPA.
   Julie Belaga, the EPA's regional administrator in New England,
said UTC faces fines and penalties ``in the millions'' of dollars.
Between 1985 and 1989, the company paid $210,000 in penalties to
the EPA.
   She said the alleged violations do not pose any direct threat to
human health and safety. The facilities named in the suit are all
in Connecticut.
   ``The violations at the UTC facilities are serious and
persistent,'' she said at a news conference. ``UTC has not
implemented corporate management systems that would ensure
environmental compliance at all its facilities.''
   EPA officials said the waste at issue in the UTC case is
byproducts from the production of jet engine parts.
   Peter Kowalchuk, a spokesman for UTC, said the company was
reviewing the lawsuit and had no immediate comment.
   UTC, based in Hartford, is a major government contractor that
designs and makes Pratt &amp; Whitney jet engines, Otis elevators and
escalators, Carrier air conditioning equipment, Sikorsky
helicopters, Hamilton Standard jet controls, and Norden Systems
radar systems for battlefield operations.
   The company employs about 50,000 people in Connecticut and
200,000 worldwide.

   Stock prices dropped sharply today in light
trading as oil prices continued to climb and a report indicated
further erosion in the U.S. economy, analysts said.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was down 23.77
points to 2,590.59 as of 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   In the broader market, declining stocks outnumbered advancing
ones by 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 467 up, 956

   Soybean futures prices surged Tuesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade, rebounding from levels that some analysts
had viewed as excessively low after a week-long decline.
   Meanwhile, wheat futures retreated for the sixth consecutive
session and hit new life-of-contract lows across the board.

steady drop in wheat prices reflects abundant supplies of the grain
due to large harvests in the United States, Argentina, India and
the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Bank of New England Selling Rhode Island Subsidiary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A subsidiary of a Scottish banking group agreed to
buy most of Bank of New England Corp.'s Rhode Island operation for
$75 million Tuesday, buying a little hope for the troubled bank's
prospects.
   The deal will sell most of the best of Bank of New England-Old
Colony assets to the Citizens Financial Group of Providence, R.I.
Citizens is a subsidiary of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group, a
financial services holding company.
   Selling off its Rhode Island interest is the last major move in
Bank of New England's efforts to boost its capital and restructure
its operation.
   ``This sale virtually completes our program to downsize the
company and to concentrate our efforts on our strong franchises in
Connecticut, Maine and Massachusetts,'' BNE chairman and chief
officer Lawrence K. Fish said in a prepared statement.
   ``It happens to fit our franchise well,'' said Kenneth E.
Hogberg, chief financial officer of Citizens, in an interview from
Providence. ``We think the franchise will continue to carry a lot
of value.''
   With the disposal of the Rhode Island subsidiary, Bank of New
England will be left with three major subsidiaries: Maine National
Bank, Connecticut Bank and Trust and Bank of New England. They
employ about 14,000 people, a bank spokesman said.
   The bank has been shedding assets and its work force since it
came under increased government scrutiny when the region's economy
began to slide and the real estate market exposed piles of bad
loans.
   The bank lost more than $1 billion in 1989. It has lost $46.6
million in the first quarter that ended March 31 and more than $30
million in the second quarter of this year.
   Analysts said the sale of Old Colony is good for Bank of New
England, but can't be looked upon as the transaction that will
start the company's turnaround.
   More important will be reducing its non-performing assets, the
analysts said. That in turn depends on whether the New England
economy recovers soon.
   ``Picture a guy crossing a desert, dying, and they find a small
oasis with a little bit of water,'' Don J. Kauth, an analyst at
First Albany Corp. said of the sale of Old Colony. ``The question
is, will they make the rest of the way across the desert? It
depends on how wide the desert is.
   ``Unless the economy improves, the Bank of New England is going
to run out of capital before they run out of non-performing
assets,'' Kauth said.
   Bank of New England bought the 70-year-old former Old
Colony-Newport National Bank in 1986.
   Under the agreement, Citizens will acquire $600 million of
selected Old Colony assets while Bank of New England keeps $550
million in assets. It will also acquire more than $900 million in
deposits while Bank of New England keeps about $250 million in
deposits, liabilities and capital.
   Also under the terms, Citizens will acquire and operate the Old
Colony branch network as part of Citizens Bank, while Bank of New
England keeps the BancNew England Mortgage Co., a subsidiary of Old
Colony, based in East Providence.
   The deal would increase Citizens' assets to $3.7 billion, making
it Rhode Island's second biggest bank.
   The Bank of New England fell victim to the rumor mill last week,
its stock falling 62{ cents a share to $1 Thursday after a
congressional candidate erroneously suggested federal regulators
had recommended a takeover of the bank.
   The Comptroller of the Currency in Washington, the chief
regulator for the Bank of New England, as well as the bank denied
and denounced the rumors.
   Confidence apparently restored, the bank's stock rose again
Friday and closed at $2.12{ a share.
   In afternoon trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange,
Bank of New England was selling for $1.87{ a share.

<HEAD>Fujitsu Introduces Fastest Mainframe Computer Series</HEAD>
<HEAD>Graphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fujitsu, Japan's largest computer maker, announced
a powerful new mainframe computer Tuesday that it says is the
fastest in the world. The news came a day before rival IBM is
expected announce its new top-of-the-line models.
   Both companies are depending on their new-generation mainframes
to maintain their technological and competitive leadership in
high-end computers.
   International Business Machines Corp. has refused to release
details of its new computer line before its announcement scheduled
for Wednesday.
   Fujitsu officials said the top model in their new M-1800 series
is capable of executing up to 600 million instructions per second,
or mips, in scientific calculations.
   Analysts say the new IBM top-of-the-line computer, code-named
the Summit, will run at a maximum speed of about 230 mips. The most
powerful current IBM mainframe can handle about 112 mips.
   However, IBM, the world's largest computer company, is expected
to announce that customers will be able to link several of the new
models together to boost power dramatically, perhaps exceeding 600
mips.
   Toshio Hiraguri, general manager of Fujitsu's Computer Systems
Group, said the 600 mips figure doesn't adequately represent
typical operating conditions, under which he said the M-1800 series
would run even faster.
   Unlike supercomputers, which are designed to make repetitive
scientific calculations, mainframes must be able to handle a wide
range of general business, data base and communications information
_ often at the same time.
   ``We believe Fujitsu's mainframe will be competitive not just
today, but also tomorrow,'' a company official said, referring to
IBM's expected announcement.
   NEC in July announced a mainframe that it says is capable of 500
mips. But it uses a different operating system than the system
shared by IBM, Fujitsu and Hitachi, making a direct comparison of
processing speeds difficult. The operating system is the base layer
of software that controls internal computer functions.
   Hitachi in June announced it will build a mainframe capable of
155 mips.
   Fujitsu's M-1800 series' speed comes in part from special
high-speed logic and memory chips, high-capacity fiber-optic
interconnections and sophisticated batch processing of data, the
company said. The top-of-the-line model 85 also will be the first
mainframe in the world with eight processors, it said.
   The new IBM computers will have similar features, except the top
model will have only six processors, analysts say.
   Fujitsu officials denied that they timed their announcement
Tuesday to reduce the impact of IBM's news conference in the United
States.
   ``We've been planning to begin shipments next April, and our
customers have been asking us to make the announcement as soon as
possible,'' a Fujitsu official said. ``So it's just a coincidence
that IBM decided to announce its computer at about the same time.''
   IBM officials declined to comment Tuesday on Fujitsu's
announcement. The U.S. company depends on sales of mainframes and
associated software and equipment for about half its annual profit.
   Fujitsu said it plans to sell about 300 of the
multimillion-dollar systems over the next three years, with most
sales likely to be in Japan. The computers also will be sold
overseas under the nameplate of Siemens AG, the West German
computer company, and their technology is likely to appear in
mainframes produced by Amdahl Corp., a U.S. maker of IBM-compatible
mainfames that is 45 percent owned by Fujitsu.
   Amdahl and Hitachi generally have undercut IBM's mainframe
prices and have eaten into its sales in recent years, although IBM
still has about 87 percent of the U.S. high-end mainframe market,
says Computer Intelligence, a California research firm.
   Some industry analysts have predicted a declining market for
large general-service mainframes, saying customers would be better
off buying increasingly sophisticated smaller computer workstations
that can be tailored to specific functions.
   Several of the new Fujitsu machines, however, can be linked
together, with each handling separate functions such as data base
processing, communications and application processing to customize
and maximize performance, the company said.
   ``With this announcement, we want to say that the mainframe
business is not dead,'' said a Fujitsu official, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``They will continue to be the main anchor
for customers, whether they be researchers or businesses.''
   Fujitsu said it expects to sell most of its M-1800 systems to
financial institutions, research institutes, government
organizations and engineering facilities.

<TEXT>
   The number of working oil and natural gas rigs in
the United States rose again this week, climbing by 10 to 1,012,
Baker Hughes Inc. reported.
   A week ago, the count had increased by 15 to total 1,002. The
count a year ago this week was 936, Baker Hughes said Tuesday.
   The Houston-based oil toolmaker company has kept track of the
rig count _ the widely watched index of drilling activity _ since
1940. The count represents the number of rigs actively exploring
for oil, not those producing oil.
   Ike Kerridge, keeper of the count at Baker Hughes, said Tuesday
that the increase in oil prices caused by the Middle East crisis
probably is beginning to have some positive impact on the rig count.
   ``Some of (the count increase) may be a reflection of higher
prices _ although it is the season when (the count) goes up
anyway,'' Kerridge said. ``And the increase have been modest. But
if (the Middle East crisis) hasn't begun to affect it yet, I think
it will very shortly.''
   Kerridge said there is no absolute way to judge exactly how
rising oil prices affects the domestic rig count.
   At the height of the oil boom in December 1981, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But the rig count plunged to a low of 663
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986.
   Among major oil-producing states, Kansas added seven rigs to its
count, followed by California and Wyoming, which each gained five.
Colorado's count was up four, Ohio was up three, Texas gained two
rigs and Pennsylvania added one more.
   Louisiana lost eight rigs, Oklahoma's count was down by six and
North Dakota lost two.

<HEAD>Oil Futures Surge On Fading Hopes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil futures prices surged Tuesday as fading
hopes for a settlement to the Middle East crisis helped turn
traders' attention to the prospects for tight supplies in the last
three months of the year.
   The October contract for light sweet crude oil rose $1.80 a
42-gallon barrel to settle at $29.12 on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The contract had risen 55 cents on Friday, the last
trading day before the Labor Day holiday.
   Contracts for petroleum products also posted sharp advances.
October contracts for unleaded regular gasoline jumped 8.34 cents a
gallon to settle at 94.52 cents. The September contract had risen
7.25 cents before expiring at the close of trading Friday.
   Home heating oil for October delivery settled at 82.39 cents per
gallon, up 5.83 cents. The expiring September contract had gained
0.35 cent on Friday.
   Higher oil prices, which are a harbinger of higher inflation,
sent bond prices lower. In other markets, stock prices were mixed
with the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials falling less than a
point. In currency dealings, the dollar slumped.
   Even in the absence of significant developments in the Persian
Gulf, analysts had expected energy futures prices to spike higher
following a sharp advance in London on Monday.
   Traders turned their attention to the basic ``supply and demand
balances,'' said oil analyst Jim Murchie of Sanford C. Bernstein &amp;
Co. ``Things are quiet enough now for people to go back and do the
basic work.''
   Present oil supplies may not meet demand for the chilly fourth
quarter, Murchie said, adding that half the world's oil is used for
heating. In the last quarter of the year, oil stocks are typically
drawn down to meet heightened demand.
   ``Before the crisis we were expecting a 1 to 1.5 million barrel
a day drawdown, now we're projecting a 2 to 2.5 million barrels a
day to meet fourth-quarter demand,'' Murchie said.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' recent
agreement to increase its daily crude production quota to 22.5
million barrels daily still falls short of projected fourth-quarter
demand, Murchie said.
   During a crisis, those who hold oil contracts are reluctant to
sell, which pushes the price higher. Experts said there was a lack
of sellers on Tuesday, which was responsible for the rise in prices
amid moderate volume.
   The market also was weighed down by disappointment over the slow
release of hostages by Iraq and the unsuccessful attempts by United
Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to mediate the
crisis.
   ``People are a little more pessimistic . . . and war is a little
bit more on their minds today,'' said James Fiedler, a vice
president at E.D.&amp;F. Man International Inc., in explaining the
advance in oil prices.
   But he also said the market's behavior was unusual in light of
last week's action, when crude contracts opened $1 a barrel lower
after a weekend also devoid of major developments.

<TEXT>
   American Airlines and United Airlines
have tabled their dispute at Chicago's O'Hare International
Airport, pending a decision from the Federal Aviation
Administration.
   A hearing had been scheduled Tuesday over whether to bar United
from operating under new flight schedules at O'Hare. U.S. District
Judge John McBride last month ordered United to make changes in its
schedule.
   Fort Worth-based American contends United's proposed schedule is
misleading to passengers.
   But the airlines requested a postponement of Tuesday's hearing
to Sept. 17 while they await the FAA decision, American spokesman
Tim Smith said.
   ``What happened is that we have not as yet heard any decision
from the FAA and both parties have agreed to essentially postpone
the hearing in federal court for a couple of weeks because we did
not want to be in the middle of that and get some kind of decision
from the FAA,'' Smith said.
   If the FAA ruling favors American, Smith said the lawsuit likely
would be dropped. ``Obviously, if the FAA ruled in United's favor
we would continue our legal pursuit of the matter,'' he said.
   United schedules starting Oct. 1 reflect not-yet approved
deviations from federal guidelines on takeoffs and landings at
O'Hare, American said.
   The high-density slot rules are intended to regulate traffic at
four of the nation's busiest airports by designating times for
takeoffs and landings.
   United contends the schedules were ``carefully designed to
reduce congestion and delay at O'Hare.''
   United, based in Chicago, earlier this year replaced American as
the nation's largest carrier.

<HEAD>Hachette Unit Suspends Regular Publication of Memories Magazine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Memories magazine is cutting back its
publication schedule because of the weak advertising climate, its
publishers announced Tuesday.
   Diamandis Communications Inc., a U.S. subsidiary of France's
Hachette SA, said that regular publication of Memories will be
suspended with its October issue. It said Memories will appear
twice a year starting in 1991.
   The magazine has been published every other month since early
1989 and plans had been to make it a monthly this fall.
   But Peter Diamandis, president and chief executive of Diamandis
Communications, said ``the current softness in the advertising
marketplace makes it imprudent to continue the current rollout
plan.''
   Hachette made the move after efforts to sell the magazine failed.
   Memories was launched in the spring of 1988, and sought to tap
readers' fascination in the past by taking another look at major
events of the past 50 years. Among the stories it updated were the
Battle of Britain, the Kennedy assassination, the March of Dimes
crusade and baseball slugger Ted Williams.
   But it ran into a tough ad environment. Ad pages in magazines
were down 3.3 percent in the first half of 1990 compared with a
year earlier, according to Publishers Information Bureau, and no
signs of a pickup in demand are evident.
   So far this year, the ad slump has figured in the closing,
suspension, consolidation and redesign of several magazines.
   Woman, 7 Days and Southpoint magazines have folded. Psychology
Today suspended publication in January but hopes to reappear in
January. Manhattan Inc. magazine ceased publication and merged with
the fashion magazine M under the new title M Inc. The nightlife
magazine Details was converted into a general interest men's
magazine.
   Didier Guerin, president of Hachette Publications Inc. which
oversees Diamandis Communications, said Memories was up for sale
for a couple months and that a deal was nearly reached with
Mortimer Zuckerman, the real estate baron who is chairman and
editor in chief of U.S. News &amp; World Report and chairman of The
Atlantic Monthly magazine.
   Zuckerman said in a telephone interview that he talked with
Hachette about Memories but said ``we never made a formal proposal
to buy the magazine.''
   ``We came to the conclusion that the economy was so bad and
getting worse that it wasn't good time to be excessively
adventuresome,'' he said.
   Guerin said the deteriorating economic climate is prompting
advertisers to cut back on ad spending. ``The last thing they need
is a new publication that is not established,'' he said.
   Nonetheless, he said Memories would be published twice a year
because ``it's still a good concept, still a strong name and we
should be able to keep it alive'' at that rate. If the economy
improves, he said the magazine could be published more often. It
has promised advertisers a circulation of 600,000.
   The magazine had a staff of 27 and Guerin said efforts would be
made to find jobs for them at other Hachette magazines. Those other
titles include Boating, Car and Driver, Elle and Popular
Photography.
   Guerin said there were a ``few others'' in addition to Zuckerman
who expressed interest in Memories, but he declined to identify
them.
   He said none of the other Hachette magazines are on the market.
   Earlier this year, Hachette put its Woman's Day magazine up for
sale to trim the company's debt, but pulled it off the market in
July after bidders failed to show up with the price it wanted.
   The magazine's demise comes less than two week's before the
premiere of a weekly television show that has licensed the
magazine's name, ``Memories . . . Then and Now.''
   The show is being produced by NBC News Productions, a unit of
the National Broadcasting Co., and will be carried starting Sept.
15 on more than 120 stations serving more than 80 percent of the
nation's households with TV.
   Therese Byrne, head of the unit, said there was no editorial
link between the magazine and the television show, however, and
that the reduced frequency of the magazine should have no impact on
the show.

<HEAD>Manufacturing Economy Slows Again, Purchasing Managers Report</HEAD>

   The nation's purchasing managers said Tuesday
that manufacturing slowed in August, providing more evidence of a
looming recession and signs that the Persian Gulf crisis is taking
a toll on the economy.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management, which tracks
the manufacturing economy through a monthly poll of its members,
said its overall index of business activity at 300 industrial
companies fell to 47.0 percent from 47.4 percent in July.
   When the index registers below 50 percent, it indicates the
economy is weakening.
   The drop in the index was the second consecutive monthly
decline. The index stood at 51.1 percent in June.
   The purchasing managers report contained few surprises, but
still was ``evidence that the economy is slowing down, and slowing
down fast,'' said David Wyss, chief financial economist for
DRI-McGraw Hill in Lexington, Mass.
   The report said production and new orders were down in August,
prices for raw materials moved sharply higher and employment was
down. Prices and employment appeared to be affected by the
month-long Persian Gulf crisis.
   Wyss said the employment component, in particular, ``suggests
quite frankly that businesses are quite scared by the Mideast. ...
They taking on fewer people.''
   Economic news from Washington Tuesday also was less than
encouraging. The Commerce Department reported construction spending
edged up 0.4 percent in July for its first gain in four months, but
the government revised downward its estimate of spending in May and
June.
   Despite the July gain, analysts expect the industry to remain
weak due to consumer caution, high interest rates, tight lending
requirements and, in some areas, overbuilding.
   A report on productivity was equally downbeat. The Labor
Department said the productivity of American workers improved for
the first time in more than a year, climbing in the second quarter
at an annual rate of 1.5 percent.
   But the advance was well below the level needed to significantly
boost Americans' standard of living. Furthermore, the productivity
report contained figures showing steep labor cost increases, which
elevated concerns that inflation is accelerating, especially in
light of the Middle East oil crisis that threatens to step up price
increases.
   The purchasing managers, noting production was off for the first
time in seven months, attributed the slowdown to a sharp drop in
new orders in July.
   Twenty percent of the purchasing managers said production was up
in August, while 54 percent reported it was unchanged and 26
percent said it was down. That compared with 19 percent reporting
higher production in July, 58 percent reporting it was unchanged
and 23 percent saying it had slowed.
   New orders dropped for the second straight month. Twenty-one
percent of the purchasing managers said new orders rose during
August, while 49 percent reported they were stable and 30 percent
reported they had declined. In July, 19 percent reported growth in
new orders, 53 percent reported they were the same and 28 percent
said they had declined.
   The purchasing managers said export orders also dropped, as did
imports.
   Prices for raw materials rose during August, a reflection of
higher energy prices resulting from the Gulf crisis. Twenty-two
percent of the purchasing managers said they were paying higher
prices, 68 percent said they were paying the same amount, and 10
percent said prices were down. That compared with 12 percent
reporting higher prices in July, 77 reporting stable prices and 11
percent reporting lower prices.
   Employment fell for the 18th straight month during August and at
a slightly faster rate than in July. Nine percent of the purchasing
executives said employment was up at their companies, 68 percent
said it was the same and 23 percent said it was down. In July, 13
percent said employment was up, 70 percent said it was the same and
17 percent reported a decline.
   The lone bright spot in the August report was a slowing in
supplier deliveries, which indicated companies had more orders than
they could fill. Seven percent of the purchasing managers surveyed
said supplier deliveries were slower, 87 percent reported they were
the same, and 6 percent said they were faster. That compared with 6
percent who said they were slower in July, 83 percent who said they
were the same and 11 percent who said they were faster.
   The purchasing managers also said inventories continued to
decline last month.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management is a research
and education organization with more than 33,000 members.

<HEAD>Gold Buyers Scarce Despite Rise With Oil</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Investors burned by last week's gold collapse were reluctant to
re-enter the precious metals market Tuesday despite surging oil
prices and a lower stock market, two factors that typically spur
strong gains in gold.
   Gold futures prices rose only slightly on New York's Commodity
Exchange while silver futures retreated.
   On other commodity markets, grain and soybean futures were
widely mixed; orange juice futures fell sharply; and livestock and
meat futures were mostly higher.
   Gold futures settled $1 to $1.40 higher on the Commodity
Exchange with the contract for delivery in September up $1.40 at
$383.70 a troy ounce. Silver futures ended 4.1 cents to 5.4 cents
lower with September at $4.719 a troy ounce.
   Light sweet crude oil soared more than $1.80 a barrel on the New
York Mercantile Exchange amid reports the U.S. Navy had stopped and
boarded a tea-laden Iraqi-flagged freighter in the Gulf of Oman as
part of the trade blockade against Iraq.
   Any sign of rising tension in the Middle East is likely to
prompt an increase in both crude oil prices and inflation fears,
which is ordinarily bullish for gold.
   But after gold prices dropped last week from more than $415 to
less than $385 an ounce, investors are leery about buying the
metal, said Fredric Tordella, president of MTB Banking Corp., a New
York-based dealer of precious metals and foreign currency.
   He said the market's Aug. 27 plunge of $26.70, its steepest
decline in seven years, ``really shook a lot of people up _ not
only their pocketbooks but their faith in the metals market and how
it's going to react to the current situation.''
   Anne Orton, a vice president of the precious metals and currency
dealer Deak International Inc., agreed that last week's big drop
``took a lot of steam out of the market.
   ``I don't see it totally collapsing under the current
circumstances but I don't think there's really much to go on the
upside,'' she said.
   On the New York Merc, light sweet crude oil futures finished 61
cents to $1.80 higher with the October contract at $29.12 a barrel;
heating oil was 4 cents to 5.83 cents higher with October at 82.39
cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 4 cents to 8.34 cents higher
with October at 94.52 cents a gallon.
   Soybean futures surged on the Chicago Board of Trade, rebounding
from levels that some analysts had viewed as excessively low after
a week-long decline.
   But wheat futures retreated for the sixth consecutive session
and hit new life-of-contract lows across the board, reflecting
abundant supplies worldwide. Corn futures were mostly higher.
   The corn and soybean crops moved rapidly toward maturity last
week, accoring to the Agriculture Department's weekly crop-progress
report, which was released after the close.
   The report showed 81 percent of the corn crop in the dough, or
kernel-forming stage as of Sunday compared with 91 percent at the
same time last year and a 94 percent average.
   Soybean plants were setting pods in 90 percent of the crop as of
Sunday compared with 91 percent a year ago and a 93 percent
average, the USDA reported.
   Wheat futures settled 1} cents to 6\ cents lower with September
at $2.56\ a bushel; corn was 2{ cents lower to 1\ cents higher with
September at $2.40} a bushel; oats were 1\ cents to 2} cents higher
with September at $1.07} a bushel; soybeans were 2{ cents to 11
cents higher with September at $6.08 a bushel.
   Orange juice futures fell sharply on the New York Cotton
Exchange for the fourth straight session amid expectations that
Brazilian juice processors will announce further price cuts.
   Frozen concentrated orange juice settled 2.5 cents to 3.35 cents
lower with September at $1.567 a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures ended mostly higher on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, reflecting strong retail demand for beef and
perceptions that the hog market is about to enter a seasonal
uptrend.
   Live cattle futures settled .30 cent to .80 cent higher with
October at 77.02 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent to .45
cent higher with September at 87.02 cents a pound; live hogs were
.05 cent to .62 cent higher with October at 48.92 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .30 cent lower to .47 cent higher with
February at 50.20 cents a pound.

   Like the mythical Icarus with his waxen wings,
Ernest Saunders was a high flier who crashed.
   The former chief executive of Guinness PLC, who earned $740,000
the year he engineered what was then Britain's largest corporate
takeover, has lost his job, his wealth and, finally, his freedom.
   His wife suffered a nervous breakdown and remains far away in
Switzerland. All he has left is the loyalty of his three children _
and an unshakable insistence that he is innocent.
   References to Icarus cropped up in several newspapers late last
month as Saunders began a 5-year jail term for organizing an
illegal operation to ensure Guinness' successful takeover of
Distillers Ltd., a Scottish whisky and gin maker.
   Judge Sir Denis Henry summed up Saunders as ``a very determined
and single-minded man, used to getting your own way and relentless
in pursuit of it.''
   Gerald Ronson, 51, chief of Heron International PLC, and former
stockbroker Anthony Parnes, 44, were given 12 months and 2{ years
respectively for their part in the affair. Ronson also was fined a
record $9.85 million.
   Financier Sir Jack Lyons, 74, convicted with them, will be
sentenced Sept. 25.
   The four were found guilty of 19 charges ranging from stock
manipulation and theft to false accounting in Guinness' hard-fought
$5.04 billion takeover bid for Distillers in 1986.
   The court found the four had illegally inflated the price of
Guinness stock, making the company's bid more attractive than a
rival offer from the Argyll supermarket group.
   During the six-month trial at Southwark Crown Court, Saunders,
54, denied knowing about any illegal payments to buyers of Guinness
stock.
   But he said he had encouraged ``people, institutions, anyone I
met'' to sell Distillers shares to Guinness rather than to Argyll
and to buy Guinness shares, ``because that was my job.''
   During seven days of testimony, Saunders testily defended his
integrity, characterizing the government's allegations as
``scurrilous,'' ``disgraceful'' and ``disgusting.''
   Benjamin Guinness, the chairman of the family brewing enterprise
founded in Dublin in 1759, had hired Saunders in 1981 to reverse
the company's falling fortunes. And that's just what he did.
   Starting in June 1984, Guinness expanded vigorously, buying a
chain of newsagencies, the Champneys group of health clubs,
Nature's Best health products and the Cranks health food restaurant
chain.
   In 1985 Guinness quietly took over the Scottish whisky makers
Arthur Bell and Sons.
   Between 1981 and 1985 Guinness' pre-tax profits rose to $170
million from $82.3 million.
   James Saunders said Guinness' value on the stock market jumped
to $5.6 billion by 1986 from $168 million in 1981.
   But within a year of clinching the takeover of Distillers in
1986, Saunders was out of a job and in police custody, charged in
Britain's biggest financial scandal.
   He had been known in ``the City,'' London's financial district,
as a brilliant marketing man. And when trouble broke, observers
say, the marketing man came to the fore.
   ``So was born Saunders the Scapegoat,'' said the Observer, a
London Sunday newspaper. ``Innocent Ernest Saunders, the chairman
and chief executive who knew nothing, heard nothing and most
certainly did nothing that could have caused him to face a trial.''
   This was the hero of ``Nightmare,'' a 270-page book written by
his 24-year-old son James. The book depicts Saunders suffering a
``living hell'' after his arrest in May 1987.
   The man accustomed to limousines rode the subway to court, lived
in a small flat and relied on legal aid to pay for his attorney.
   James and his sister Joanna, 25, often came to court with their
father. Saunders' co-defendants were supported by glamorous wives,
but Carole Saunders stayed in Switzerland, where she and her
husband had gone in 1987 to recover from psychological stress.
   ``The man I knew as energetic, logical and lucid, a
perfectionist, had changed into an intellectually broken man,''
testified Dr. Eric Rochat, who treated Saunders.
   Saunders' colleagues at Guinness portrayed him as ambitious,
single-minded, sometimes domineering and even ruthless.
   Olivier Roux, former Guinness finance director, said Saunders
was willing to delegate, but in the Distillers bid, ``where it was
never comfortable, he was involved in all aspects and overseeing
all aspects.''
   According to The Times of London, Guinness workers had a
nickname for Ernest Saunders. They called the boss ``deadly
Ernest.''
   Two inches taller than 6 feet, he was every inch the gray-haired
patrician with steady gaze and studied courtesy. His club was the
Carlton, the traditional hideaway for leaders of the Conservative
Party.
   The image obscured the roots of the man.
   Born Ernst Walter Schleyer in Vienna on Oct. 21, 1935, he was
the son of Uly and Hanni Schleyer, a Jewish couple who fled from
the Nazis to England in 1938.
   In Britain, they determined that Ernst and his brother Peter
should ``be brought up as English boys,'' according to James
Saunders. Ernst Schleyer became Ernest Saunders at age 12, when he
entered the prestigious St Paul's School in London.
   After t. (AP) _ A line of boys' clothes that carry an
anti-hunting message is being yanked from the shelves at J.C.
Penney Co. Inc.'s 1,330 stores, the company said.
   Duncan Muir, public relations manager for the Dallas-based
retailer, said it took the step after complaints about the clothes
nationwide.
   ``It is our company policy not to take a position one way or the
other on these sorts of issues. This is taking a position and an
anti-position,'' he said.
   ``Obviously, this was pointed out to us and frankly we feel
we've made a mistake. All we can do is just withdraw it from the
stores,'' he said.
   Michigan United Conservation Clubs, a sportsmen's group, was
among those criticizing Penney last week for carrying the clothing.
   Penney bought the ``Environmental Protection Department'' line
of clothing from a New York company, H. Cotler Co.
   The head of the company, Howard Cotler, was in a meeting Tuesday
and did not immediately return a telephone call seeking comment.
   A card attached to each shirt in the line shows a sketch of a
bird hunter aiming a shotgun over which a large red ``X'' has been
marked. Under that are the words: ``Absolutely No Hunting of Wild
and Free Animals While Wearing This Garment.''
   A similar message is stitched into an inside panel of the
garment.
   Pants have a larger card with the message: ``Wild life protected
by man surround the world with pure thoughts.'' Tags in the clothes
indicate it was made in Hong Kong.
   In a letter to the National Rifle Association last week, Cotler
said the anti-hunting message was a marketing tool that had been
discontinued.
   He wrote that his company ``neither condemns nor supports
anti-gun or anti-hunting legislation'' and it was trying to appeal
to the environmental awareness of young people.
   Muir said he didn't know how many pieces of clothing were being
taken off Penney store shelves. ``It's in various stages of
shipment. A lot of it is still on its way and stores order on their
own, so it's hard to say how many pieces are out there.''
   He declined to place a dollar figure on the Penney order to
Cotler, saying that was an internal inventory matter. Muir also
said the retailer had not decided yet what to do with the clothes.

<TEXT>
   Digital Equipment Corp. said Tuesday it
hopes to reduce its work force by 5,000 to 6,000 jobs by offering
employees a voluntary severance program.
   The severance packages will reduce costs and overstaffing in
some of the computer company's departments, said Digital
spokeswoman Nikki Richardson.
   ``No layoffs are planned at this time and no closings are
planned at this time,'' she said.
   The packages include medical and life insurance for a year and
assistance in finding other jobs, Richardson said. The packages
will be implemented in September and should be completed by the end
of the year, she said.
   About 3,000 Digital employees accepted a similar severance
program in 1989.
   Digital announced in July that it had lost $256.7 million in the
final quarter of its fiscal year, citing $400 million in costs
related to a restructuring program.
   Digital, a Maynard-based international provider of computer
systems and services, has 124,000 employees worldwide, including
71,400 in the United States.

   Stock prices ended mixed in extremely light
trading Tuesday as oil prices continued to climb and a report
indicated further erosion in the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell a marginal
0.99 point to 2,613.37. Earlier, the key index was down as much as
30 points before a late-day rally.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about 6 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
673 up, 814 down and 473 unchanged.
   But other figures registered a slight gain. The NYSE's composite
index of all its listed common stocks rose 0.16 to 177.13, Standard
&amp; Poor's industrial index rose 0.82 to 382.85, and S&amp;P's 500-stock
composite index rose 0.53 to 323.09.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to a scant 92.94
million shares for the lowest volume of the year, down from 96.48
million Friday, the year's previous low. Traders said many market
participants apparently extended the Labor Day holiday weekend an
additional day.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 114.44 million shares.
   Analysts said continued concern about the inflationary effect of
rising oil prices helped send stock prices lower. The October
contract for crude rose $1.80 a 42-gallon barrel to settle at
$29.12 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Investors also were troubled by weakness in overseas stock
markets and signs that the U.S. economy is continuing to slow,
traders said.
   In one such sign, the National Association of Purchasing
Management said its purchasing managers index declined in August
for the second consecutive month, to 47.0 percent from 47.4 percent
in July. A reading below 50 indicates the manufacturing sector of
the economy generally is declining.
   The market's movements were exaggerated by the low trading
volume, said Steven VanBrunt, a trader with Nikko Securities Co.
International Inc. in New York.
   He said the market's late-day rally was sparked by a rise in the
stock futures market. Other traders said bargain-hunting spurred
the upswing.
   Earlier, continuing pessimism over the Middle East sent prices
plummeting on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The Nikkei Stock Average of
225 selected issues shed 512.79 points, or 2.20 percent, closing at
24,907.64. Prices also closed lower in London, but the key index,
the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100-share index, fell only 0.86
percent.
   Pinnacle West was the most-active NYSE issue, falling 3} to 12&rsqb;
as 2.2 million shares changed hands. PacifiCorp ended its struggle
to acquire the utility holding company in exchange for an agreement
to swap electricity.
   Among most-active blue chip issues on the NYSE, Boeing rose &rsqb; to
48|, General Electric fell } to 61\, Philip Morris was unchanged at
45&lsqb; and IBM was up | at 102{.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market grew $2.055 billion, or 0.07

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was mixed in domestic trading after
rising overseas Tuesday, but analysts were at a loss to explain the
U.S. currency's strength.
   Gold prices were also mixed, rising in New York and dropping in
Europe and Asia.
   The dollar was up in early trading in New York, following the
trend sent on foreign markets, but then lost some ground. Dealers
said they had no explanation for the dollar's healthier tone, and
shied away from predicting what course the U.S. currency would take.
   ``We're trying to decide whether it's a reversal of direction or
what, and we just don't know,'' said Robert Ryan, chief foreign
exchange dealer with Bank of New York Co.
   The dollar has slumped in recent weaks because of pessimism
about the U.S. economy and the effect the Persian Gulf crisis could
have on it.
   Dealers said the markets were looking toward the scheduled
release Friday of the Labor Department's employment figures for
August. The markets expect the report to confirm that the economy
is slowing down and reinforce arguments that U.S. interest rates
must come down.
   Many economists say the U.S. economy is headed into a recession
and the Federal Reserve will move to encourage lower rates. But
such a move would be a negative for the dollar, which is supported
by higher interest rates and has struggled lately to compete
against currencies of nations with higher rates.
   The dollar fell to 143.40 Japanese yen in New York, compared
with 143.785 late Friday. U.S. financial markets were closed Monday
for Labor Day.
   In Tokyo overnight, the dollar rose to 144.05 yen from 143.55 at
Monday's close. Later, in London, it was quoted at 143.55 yen.
   The British pound was down against the dollar when compared with
late Friday's price, falling to $1.8810 from $1.8905. In London,
sterling rose to $1.8750 from $1.8730 late Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
prices, included: 1.58115 German marks, up from 1.5755; 1.3135
Swiss francs, up from 1.30835; 5.2965 French francs, up from
5.2865; 1,179.00 Italian lire, up from 1,170.00; and 1.16075
Canadian dollars, up from 1.15625.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Monday, included: 1.5843 German marks, up from 1.5837; 1.3170 Swiss
francs, up from 1.3158; 5.3105 French francs, up from 5.3080;
1.7860 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7840; 1,182.25 Italian lire, up
from 1,179.00; and 1.1623 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1535.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, a troy ounce of gold rose
$1.40 to $383.70. Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of
$384.60, up $1.85.
   Overseas dealers said gold's slide was partly triggered by a
French newspaper report quoting a Palestine Liberation Organization
official as saying Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was willing to
negotiate Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait in return for certain
undertakings from the West.
   Gold is seen by some investors as a haven in times of
international tension, and its price often falls when tensions
subside.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid of $382.50 a troy ounce from
$387 late Monday. In Zurich, it fell to a closing bid of $382.25 an
ounce from $387.50 late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.74 an ounce to $388.35.
   Silver fell in New York and London. On the Commodity Exchange, a
troy ounce of silver slipped 4.1 cents to close at $4.719. In
London earlier, silver fell to a late bid of $4.75 a troy ounce,
down from $4.83 late Monday.

<TEXT>
   Healthco International Inc. will be acquired by an
affiliate of the investment firm Hicks Muse &amp; Co. Inc. for about
$250 million in cash, the companies announced Tuesday.
   Healthco will be merged into HMD Acquisition Corp., a unit of
Hicks Muse and Ray C. Davis, a former senior executive with Colt
Industries.
   The price paid for Healthco will be $19.25 a share in cash,
bringing the total value of the deal to about $250 million.
   The transaction is expected to be completed in the late autumn.
   M. Myer Cyker, Healthco chairman, said the transaction with
Hicks Muse will benefit the dental supply company's growth and
development. He said Healthco chose Hicks Muse because the
Dallas-based investment firm has a strong record in building
companies for the long term.
   The agreement is subject to financing and the approval of
Healthco stockholders.
   Healthco is a major provider of equipment and services to
dentists, dental schools and labs. The company has operations in
the United States, Canada and Western Europe, and had revenue of
about $437 million in 1989.
   Hicks Muse has completed about $6 billion of acquisitions since
1984.

<HEAD>Last of 16 Linked to Revco Insider Trading Settles Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Ohio investor, the last of 16 people
charged with passing or trading on inside information about the
leveraged buyout of Revco Drug Stores Inc., has settled civil
charges, federal regulators said Tuesday.
   Howard Passov of Pepper Pike, Ohio, settled with the Securities
and Exchange Commission without admitting or denying wrongdoing.
   He was among eight people charged in July 1989 in two separate
SEC complaints with trading on confidential information before a
management group's 1986 leveraged buyout of Revco was made public.
All but Passov settled the charges shortly after they were filed.
   Passov, however, settled in the middle of his trial at federal
court in Cleveland last week. He agreed to return $40,000 in
profits from his alleged illegal trading.
   ``We felt under the circumstances it was a fair settlement,''
said Passov's attorney Marvin Karp, adding ``We felt the case
involved unusual legal and factual issues and that's why we pursued
it to litigation. And the SEC acknowledged the validity of our
position and that's why they settled.''
   Another eight people, including the head of a Cleveland
investment banking concern, Golenberg &amp; Co., settled various
securities law charges without admitting or denying wrongdoing.
Glenn Golenberg, head of the firm, was not accused of insider
trading.
   Passov was accused of buying Revco common stock and options
while in possession of confidential information that a management
group led by Revco's chairman, Sideny Dworkin, planned to acuire
the drug store chain.

<HEAD>Customs Service Reaches Lawsuit Agreement with K mart</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   K mart Corp. has agreed to pay $6 million in
import duties and penalties for evading textile import quotas, the
government said Tuesday.
   The U.S. Customs Service said the payment would settle a civil
case against the Troy, Mich.-based retailer and its subsidiary, K
mart, Taiwan.
   The settlement includes $3 million in unpaid duties and a
penalty.
   A Customs Service investigation found that K mart and its
Taiwanese affiliate manipulated prices of various textile articles
imported from Taiwan and South Korea to ``evade the quota controls
on certain classes of those articles,'' the agency said in a
statement.
   The alleged infractions occurred between 1982 and 1985.
   Federal law limits quantities of many textile articles that can
be imported from certain countries during a given period of time.
   K mart spokesman Robert Stevenson said the dispute with the
government centered on whether the company sufficiently disclosed
its pricing practices ``during four years of very mixed regulatory
signals from Customs.''
   ``K mart at all times never intended any wrongful or mistaken
activity,'' Stevenson said. ``Above all, K mart intends to keep its
record with the Customs Service clean of lengthy disputes and
therefore agreed to settle this case.''

<HEAD>Philips Announces 4,000 Layoffs, Scrapping Of Personal Computer
Chip R&amp;D</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EINDHOVEN, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The troubled Dutch electronics
giant NV Philips said Tuesday it would discontinue several
activities in its unprofitable components division and lay off
4,000 workers mostly in Europe.
   The company will halt further development of a large memory
computer chip that it planned to use in a new portable computer
series, said Philips spokesman Jack Reemers.
   Over the past few years, Philips has spent the equivalent of
$842 million on a ``mega-project,'' much of which was devoted to
developing the technology needed to make the one-megabit static
random access memory (S-RAM) chip.
   Reemers said Philips would also suspend research on the S-RAM
chip being carried out with Siemens of West Germany and Thomson SA
of France in the cooperative ``Jessi'' project. However, Philips
will remain active in other Jessi projects.
   Philips said it had committed itself to spending $42.1 million a
year for eight years to support Jessi research on S-Ram chips.
   ``We are still very much involved in the Jessi project,'' said
Reemers.
   Philips president Jan Timmer warned at a special shareholders
meeting in July that he planned to restructure several operations
at Philips' including the components division. He predicted losses
for the year of more than $1 billion and 10,000 layoffs.
   Philips also announced Tuesday it would end production of direct
driven liquid crystal display (LCD) boards which are used as
screens for portable computers.
   The moves have led analysts to speculate that Philips is
preparing to close down its computer operations. But Reemers did
not say whether the company has such plans.
   Philips has unsuccessfully tried to save its ailing computer
operations by linking its business with a partner.
   Reemers said Philips will also halt work on semiconductor lasers
in the Netherlands and in Taiwan.
   Dutch analysts gave mixed reactions to the news that the
electronics giant was halting development of the S-RAM technology.
   ``Cost-wise, it is a good idea but strategy-wise I am not sure.
They used to regard development of memory chips as crucial to their
products,'' said an analyst who asked to remain anonymous.
   ``What is the value of a giant electronics company that can't
develop its own technology?'' he added.
   In 1989, Philips' components division had sales of about $6.2
billion and employed a total of 75,000 people.
   Of those, 35,000 worked in Europe where most of the job losses
will occur, according to company spokesman Reemers.

<TEXT>
   Walter Yetnikoff, president and chief executive
of CBS Records Inc., announced Tuesday he was stepping down as head
of the company immediately.
   Yetnikoff, 57, said in a statement he will take a few months off
before working on long-term projects with Norio Ohga, chairman of
CBS Records and president of its parent, Sony Corp.
   The label of Michael Jackson, New Kids on the Block and Bruce
Springsteen has grown to the world's largest record company under
Yetnikoff's leadership.
   ``We understand and respect his decision, and are grateful that
he will make himself available as a special adviser to me,'' Ohga
said in a statement.
   Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported that unidentified
people close to Yetnikoff said he wasn't being forced out of the
company and had in part initiated the move.
   Day-to-day operations of the company will be directed by Tommy
Mottola, president of the label's domestic business; Robert Summer,
international chief, and Neil Keating president of Columbia House,
the company said.
   The three will report directly to Ohga as the company's board of
directors considers naming Yetnikoff's successor.
   Yetnikoff, a native of Brooklyn, N.Y., started at CBS in 1961 as
an attorney and rose to president of CBS-Records Group in 1975.
   Yetnikoff is credited with steering CBS Records' climb to world
prominence and engineering its $2 billion sale to Sony Corp. in
late 1987.

<HEAD>Keating Hearing Taken off Calendar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hearing on the Office of Thrift
Supervision's attempts to extend a partial freeze on the assets of
Charles Keating Jr. was taken off the calendar in federal court
here Tuesday.
   There were no operators on duty after hours to take calls at
Kirkland &amp; Ellis, the Chicago firm representing Keating. The OTS
would say only that it might have a statement on the matter
Wednesday.
   U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson had already granted a
request by the OTS for a temporary restraining order against
Keating, who controlled Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Association in
Irvine through his Phoenix-based American Continental Corp.
   The OTS wanted Wilson to convert the temporary restraining order
to a preliminary injunction. Wilson had indicated he probably
would. There was no immediate rescheduling of the hearing.
   Keating already has complied with a key provision of the order.
That was to hand over to the OTS an accounting of his personal
finances, in essence proving that he is broke, as he contends.
   A sticking point has been the OTS' order that he give notice 48
hours before spending $5,000 or more. He's also been ordered not to
transfer money out of the country.
   Regulators say Lincoln's failure may cost taxpayers $2 billion.
They are seeking about $42 billion from Keating and five associates
in connection with soured business deals at Lincoln.
   Keating says that Lincoln's losses were compounded and
exaggerated by the regulators who seized it. He accuses them of
making him a scapegoat to cover up their own bungling supervision
of the thrift industry.

<TEXT>
   A Paine Webber Inc. account executive was
fined $125,000 and barred from dealing with members of the National
Association of Securities Dealers, the NASD announced Tuesday.
   The NASD, a self-regulating organization empowered by Congress
to oversee the over-the-counter securities market, also fined Paine
Webber and the executive's superviser $30,000.
   Both the company and the two individuals settled the charges
without admitting or denying wrongdoing.
   In an unrelated matter, the Securities and Exchange Commission
upheld an NASD disciplinary action against W.N. Whelen &amp; Co. a
Georgetown, Del., brokerage for numerous securities rule violations.
   In the Paine Webber case, Nilda Rubiera Zim, a New York City
account executive, was accused of recommending and executing
securities transactions without considering if they were suitable
for her customer's financial situation and investment objectives.
   In addition to the $125,000 Zim was barred from ``association
with any member of the NASD in any capacity.''
   The NASD also found that Zim's superior, Joseph Patrick Tota, of
Flower Hill, N.Y., and the firm itself, failed to supervise her
properly. The company and Tota were fined a total of $30,000 and
Tota was suspended from NASD association for five business days.
   In the Whelen action, the SEC, which has veto power over NASD
actions, upheld a previous decision fining the firm $25,000 and
suspending William N. Whelen Jr., the firm's president, for 10
business days.
   The NASD found that the firm misappropriated assets, violated
rules on net capital and protecting customers' investments,
improperly extended credit and other violations.
   In upholding the sanctions, the SEC noted that the firm had a
history of prior violations and had shown an unwillingness or
inability to follow the rules.

<TEXT>
   Johnson &amp; Johnson sued rival
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. on Tuesday to halt an ad campaign that
claims aspirin-free Excedrin is a better pain reliever than Johnson
&amp; Johnson's extra-strength Tylenol.
   In a lawsuit filed in federal court in New York, the New
Brunswick-based pharmaceutical giant charged that Bristol-Myers'
claims were false.
   The first commercial in Bristol-Myers' new ad campaign aired
Thursday, said Robert Kniffin, Johnson &amp; Johnson's director of
public relations.
   Because both drugs contain the same dose of the pain reliever
acetaminophen, the products are equivalent pain relievers, Kniffin
said.
   The lawsuit challenged Bristol-Myers' assertions that the 65
milligrams of caffeine in Excedrin increase the effectiveness of
acetaminophen, he said.
   It also accused Bristol-Myers of publishing misleading
conclusions from three studies in which patients were asked to
compare the effects of extra-strength Tylenol versus aspirin-free
Excedrin.
   Officials at New York-based Bristol-Myers were not in their
offices early Tuesday evening and could not be reached for comment.

<TEXT>
   An owner of a defunct Paramus-based
penny-stock firm accused of bilking customers of more than $60
million pleaded guilty Tuesday to a federal racketeering charge.
   Leonard Tucker, 30, of Boca Raton, Fla., faces up to 20 years in
federal prison and millions of dollars in fines for his part in the
F.D. Roberts Securities Inc. scam, according to a release issued by
U.S. Attorney Michael Chertoff.
   Tucker was among eight top-level F.D. Roberts officials indicted
by a Newark federal grand jury on March 26.
   The indictment alleged the eight derived $67 million in illicit
profits while associated with the penny-stock brokerage firm, which
shut down in February 1989.
   Tucker said he and his co-defendants controlled the sale of
stock, placed stock in illegal accounts, controlled the public
companies whose stock they sold and used collusive brokerage firms,
according to Chertoff.
   Tucker also said he recruited individuals with little or no
securities experience to be salespeople and condoned the use of
deceptive and misleading telephone sales techniques, Chertoff said.
   Also charged in the March indictment and awaiting trial are Fred
Galiardo of Daytona Beach, Fla.; John Perfetti of Bayville, N.Y.;
Alan Lieb of Pine Brook; John Montondo of Boca Raton; and three of
Tucker's relatives, brothers Daniel Tucker of Boca Raton and Gary
Tucker of New York, and step-father Richard Thaw of Boca Raton.
