<HEAD>Smoking Bill Gets Preliminary House OK</HEAD>

   A bill to limit smoking in this tobacco state
won preliminary approval in the House of Delegates on Monday, but
it is a weaker set of regulations than contained in legislation
supported by health groups.
   The bill would require establishment of no-smoking areas in
state and local government buildings. It would allow local
governments to impose stricter rules against smoking, but would
limit local efforts to ban smoking in small businesses, in theaters
and on public transportation.
   The bill, passed in a voice vote Monday and was due for a final
House vote Tuesday, was approved over the objection of health
lobbyists and legislators who backed a bill calling for stricter
smoking regulation.
   Nevertheless, some in the House worried about reaction in a
state whose economy was built on tobacco.
   ``Seldom in my career have I built my own political gallows and
provided the rope,'' said Delegate Charles R. Hawkins, a Republican
from tobacco-growing Pittsylvania County. ``If I vote for this, I
might be doing that.''
   If it's approved in the final House vote, the bill would have to
be reconciled with a more stringent bill recently approved by the
Senate.
   In addition to requiring no-smoking areas in government
buildings, the bill's main impact would be to set standards for
local no-smoking ordinances.
   Local governments would be allowed to demand no-smoking areas in
restaurants and ban smoking in elevators, schools, indoor service
lines and school buses.
   But local ordinances couldn't regulate smoking in businesses
with less than 10,000 square feet of floor space _ so-called mom
and pop stores. Nor could they regulate smoking in privately owned
meeting rooms, in theaters or on public transportation.
   The bill also doesn't address smoking in private work areas.
   The rejected rival bill, similar to that already approved by the
Senate, would have allowed workers to declare their areas
smoke-free by a two-thirds vote.

   President Bush, saying ``nobody wants to
threaten the Soviet Union,'' said Monday that a united Germany
belongs inside NATO, but Western forces might not be deployed in
what is now East Germany.
   Bush applauded what he called the bottom line spelled out by
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on the future of Germany: ``NATO
membership.''
   Bush also expressed ``my appreciation of Chairman (Mikhail S.)
Gorbachev's statesmanlike view that decisions regarding German
unity should be left to the people of Germany.''
   But the official East German news agency reported Monday that
Gorbachev told East German leaders flatly that a united Germany
cannot belong to NATO.
   The news agency ADN quoted Gorbachev as telling Hans Modrow,
East Germany's communist premier, that he had ``clearly told'' Kohl
that a ``united Germany staying within the structure of NATO cannot
be accepted.''
   National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft said Monday night,
``That's not exactly what (Secretary of State James) Baker was
told'' during his visit to Moscow last week. ``It was not really as
positive as that,'' Scowcroft said after a state dinner for the
president of the Congo.
   Kohl said earlier that he had gotten the ``green light'' for
unification from Gorbachev during a weekend visit to Moscow.
   Keeping Germany inside NATO would afford the most stability for
both East and West in Europe, Bush told a news conference.
   U.S. officials disclosed in Ottawa that Secretary of State James
A. Baker III had been discussing a U.S. plan for the unification of
Germany with the foreign ministers of Britain, France, West Germany
and the Soviet Union before and during his European trip.
   The so-called ``two-plus-four'' plan would call for leaders of
the East German government that emerges from March elections to
meet West German leaders to make plans for the political, legal and
economic structures of the new country.
   The two Germanies, operating as sovereign states, also would
have the power to determine the size of the German army.
   Afterward, the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and
France _ the ``Big Four'' victors over Germany in World War II _
would discuss such security issues as German membership in NATO.
   At the NATO foreign ministers meeting in Ottawa, which eastern
bloc countries are attending as observers, Baker took up the matter
with his Soviet counterpart, Eduard Shevardnadze, on Monday and
scheduled further talks with him on Tuesday.
   Britain and France have endorsed the idea and ``the Soviets are
quite interested,'' said a State Department official who spoke on
condition that he not be identified.
   ``There might be some flexibility, obviously, on the deployment
of NATO forces'' inside what is now East Germany, Bush said.
   ``I think Chancellor Kohl is absolutely correct and we ought to
support him: NATO membership,'' said Bush, who will confer with
Kohl at Camp David on Feb. 24-25.
   Bush said NATO membership for a new, united Germany ``is the
most reassuring and stabilizing concept,'' both for the West and
``in terms of how the Eastern Europeans will eventually look at it,
maybe not today.''
   ``There's some flexibility on deployment of NATO forces into
Eastern Europe. Nobody wants to threaten the Soviet Union,'' said
Bush.
   Bush conferred this past weekend at Camp David with NATO
Secretary General Manfred Woerner, who said afterwards that a way
will be found to keep Germany inside NATO while recognizing ``the
legitimate security interests of the Soviet Union.''
   One possibility, Woerner said, would be not to extend NATO's
military reach over the region that is now East Germany.
   Asked if Germany would be less threatening in an alliance rather
than neutral, Bush said: ``I think so.'' The Germans are ``good
NATO partners now and they'll be good NATO partners then,'' he said.
   East Germany is part of the Warsaw Pact.
   Bush said ``many Europeans'' would be concerned by a neutral,
non-aligned Germany. ``It's a concern that would be allayed by
having ... a unified Germany inside of NATO,'' said Bush.
   In Ottawa, meanwhile, Shevardnadze told a group of British
correspondents, ``I am not saying neutrality is the only way, but
it is the best way.''
   Shevardnadze also said the Big Four might have to take up the
issue of German reunification. ``There is room for negotiation
among the four powers,'' Shevardnadze said.
   Bush said he did not think a meeting of the four powers was
needed ``at this juncture. ... At some point, clearly, the four
powers will have to have some say.''

   Looking for a present for the valentine who has
more than everything? How about an eyelid tuck, or liposuction?
   But at anywhere from $600 to $8,000, cosmetic surgery may be too
pricey, so how does $85 a month sound for the woman, or man, of
your dreams?
   Buyer, beware!
   ``It really is a medical procedure and all surgery has problems.
It's not buying a fur coat,'' warns Dr. R. Barrett Noone, a
director of the American Board of Plastic Surgeons, which certifies
doctors in the speciality.
   ``Don't bother,'' Lee Goldsmith, a physician and practicing
lawyer, says to those thinking of cosmetic surgery. ``It's an
abused, unnecessary procedure.''
   Goldsmith only sees the failures in his New York-area law
practice, such as the a woman who came in after an implant with
``one breast going up and one going down and the surgeon was going
to charge her to do it over.''
   But successes outnumber horror stories in the
multibillion-dollar industry _ an estimated 1 million to 3 million
``image enhancement'' procedures a year in the United States.
   Cher had her nose ``refined'' several years ago. ``It looked too
big onscreen and bothered me. Hey, if I need cosmetic surgery, the
moment I need it I'm getting it. OK?'' she told People magazine.
   Angela Lansbury went public last year: Periodic cosmetic surgery
dating to 1966 has helped keep her a leading lady. The star of the
TV series ``Murder, She Wrote,'' said she decided to talk about it
because ``cosmetic surgery shouldn't be just the secret of
actresses and socialites now that it's available to anyone who
wants it and can afford it.''
   Supporters call that accessibility democratic. Critics call it a
problem.
   ``Medicine goes Madison Avenue ... with the kind of advertising
previously reserved for the ABCs _ automobiles, beer and
cigarettes,'' says the staff of a House subcommittee preparing a
bill to set some standards on how doctors can advertise such
procedures and where they can perform the operations.
   Cosmetic surgery is ``a dangerously under-regulated medical
field,'' said Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who chaired hearings last
spring that prompted his panel of the Small Business Committee to
draft the regulations.
   The panel found that cosmetic surgery is often performed by
unqualified doctors in underequipped facilities. The staff report
estimated that 3 million cosmetic operations are perfomed a year,
95 percent of them in doctors' offices where crucial emergency
equipment is often lacking. Some say the 3 million figure is way
too high, but there's no way to know for sure.
   Men accounted for nearly 30 percent of the 1988 patients for
doctors in the American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery, and 22 percent
of facial surgery by those in the American Society of Plastic and
Reconstructive Surgeons.
   Earpinnings, or croppings, are big with males, who had 53
percent of those procedures reported for 1988 by the Plastic and
Reconstructive Surgeons group; a further breakdown shows that 53
percent of the total ear procedures was done on children age 12 or
younger. Men had 23 percent of the eyelid surgery, 12 percent of
the facelifts and 13 percent of the liposuction _ fat removal.
   The consumer's dilemma _ and everyone seems to agree the
consumer can get caught in the middle _ is that any licensed
physician can do cosmetic surgery. Or brain surgery, for that
matter, but the demand doesn't seem to be so high.
   ``Physicians have responded to the demand, not created it,''
says Dr. Richard Caleel, president of the American Academy of
Cosmetic Surgery.
   The demand, or the money, has induced doctors who are certified
in gynecology, ear, nose and throat, or whatever to turn to the
more lucrative work. A top plastic surgeon can do 16 operations a
week at ``$3,000 to $4,000 a pop,'' Goldsmith says.
   Doctors can legally advertise, perform operations any place they
choose and call themselves board certified without designating the
speciality.
   This has set up a feud involving doctors trained in plastic and
reconstructive surgery and those trained in some other specialty
who turned to cosmetic work, those who square off for or against
advertising, and those who, like Goldsmith, say the risks of such
elective surgery are just too great.
   Pity the poor consumer!
   ``There are some very serious abuses going on out there,'' says
D.Ann Murphy, a staff investigator for Wyden's committee. ``People
being blinded, lost limbs, serious scarring.''
   It goes ``well beyond a turf battle'' among the various medical
groups, she says, and blames a big part of the problem on people
``lured'' into doctor's offices by ads suggesting they need
something they didn't know they wanted.
   Goldsmith is ``upset by the ads, to put it mildly. There is a
tremendous selling of plastic surgery going on and much of it is
being done by individuals who don't have the necessary skills.''
   Advertising lets people know that techniques have improved, that
a hospital stay isn't necessary, that face fixes are affordable,
that it's not just for the rich and famous and, quite frequently,
that one can charge it.
   Profiles &amp; Contours, with clinics in New York and Connecticut,
runs full-page ads with the headline: ``Look like a million for a
couple of thousand.'' It goes on to say you can get liposuction or
breast enlargement for as little as $85 a month.
   The group's 18-page booklet, with the picture of a young model
on the cover, says cosmetic surgery is not about vanity or
self-indulgence, it's about feeling better about yourself. ``As
plastic surgery grows in awareness and acceptance it will gradually
become as common as eyeglasses, braces, and hearing aids and be
just as useful,'' it says.
   The booklet has a section on choosing a plastic surgeon that
includes tips supporters and critics can agree on: Interview
surgeons, check out the hospitals they're affiliated with, make
sure they have the proper credentials.
   Those on the center's mailing list got a letter recently
offering ``an interest rate that's just 12 percent. ... We can also
help you by deferring your first payment till after the holidays.''
Costs range from $600 to $8,000.
   ``I call that seduction. That's not the way medicine should be
practiced,'' Noone says of ads that promise facelifts for a small
monthly payment.
   People need to know what's available, says Caleel, who practices
in Chicago and is a professor of surgery at the Chicago College of
Osteopathic Medicine.
   ``If a child is born with protruberant ears, having those ears
repositioned can be very beneficial. They can be a type of stigma
in our society,'' he said. ``It's very rewarding to see a woman in
her 50s get her first short haircut,'' because she finally had
surgery to correct large ears she'd been ashamed of.

<TEXT>
   When Nelson Mandela, dignified but fists
clenched high in exultation, walked out of South Africa's Victor
Verster Prison, the major U.S. networks and CNN _ and South African
TV _ aired it live.
   The dramatic moment doubtless was taken for granted by younger
viewers used to instant TV news-by satellite. In the slow old days,
the moment would be shot on film and wouldn't reach the U.S. for
hours, or maybe a day.
   Still, it's how you tell the story that counts, not how you show
off your techno-smarts.
   And on that basis, ABC's coverage of the Mandela story this
weekend was easily the best in all respects _ in reporting the
story, in giving it perspective, and in showing, with a minimum of
extraneous chatter, the drama of the moments before, during and
after Mandela's release.
   Ted Koppel, who went to South Africa last Monday and on
Wednesday anchored the first of three ``Nightline'' broadcasts
there, smoothly and knowledgeably anchored ABC's Sunday coverage
from Cape Town.
   NBC anchorman Tom Brokaw _ he and Koppel were the only U.S.
network anchors at Saturday's news conference in which President
F.W. de Klerk said Mandela would be freed _ also was in that city
on Sunday.
   Neither was physically present at the deceptively
pleasant-looking prison grounds for the release, however. They
worked from other locations, while CBS anchorman Dan Rather worked
out of Johannesburg, more than 800 miles away.
   Sunday's live pictures from the prison entrance and the crowd
and security police around it were provided on a pooled basis by
the state-run South African Broadcasting Corp.
   Koppel and ABC wisely concentrated on scenes of the prison
entrance and the crowds there, showing the long wait, the patience
of those come to see a man imprisoned 27 years ago for choosing to
fight apartheid.
   Brokaw and Rather, on the other hand, tended to fill the wait
with interviews of various South African figures, going more for
the analytical than the personal.All that was well and good,
journalistically speaking.
   But given the drama of main event at hand, it came across as
awfully dry stuff.
   ABC and NBC also broadcast portions of the low-key,
straightforward running commentary of SABC announcer Clarence
Keyter, which gave U.S. viewers a sense of what kind of coverage
South Africans were getting on state-run TV.
   All the networks had crews in Soweto, televising the reactions
of a crowd of joyous blacks in front of Mandela's home there.
   But ABC, in a literal case of one-upsmanship, also had a
chartered helicopter flying over the area, showing the scene from
the air, giving viewers an idea of the size of the crowd, which
seemed to fill perhaps two blocks.
   This may be an era of the portable anchor, but the story proved
a long-distance scramble for Rather, and, to a lesser extent,
Brokaw.
   Brokaw, in New York when NBC was tipped that Mandela might be
released this weekend, made a mad dash for the airport Thursday and
flew to South Africa, a spokeswoman said.
   Rather's trip was just as hurried, but far longer. After more
than a week of anchoring from Moscow, he had returned on Friday to
New York, a spokeswoman said. But he roared right out again
Saturday morning to Johannesburg.
   Only ABC anchorman Peter Jennings was able to rest at home here.
But he had a few air miles logged, too. According to a spokesman,
Jennings, after a week in Cambodia working on a special, flew to
Moscow last week to anchor part of ``World News Tonight'' from
Monday through Wednesday. Then he returned here.
   He wouldn't have found ABC News president Roone Arledge here,
though. A spokesman said Arledge had flown to South Africa to help
direct ABC's coverage.

   Carrie Stringfellow can't remember what
happened to her six months ago when she was nearly embalmed after
being mistaken for dead. That doesn't stop her from joking about it.
   ``I said `When I die, I'm going to stay dead,''' she said,
laughing during an interview last week at a nursing home.
   But her experience was no joke to state officials, who are
tightening up the rules defining who is qualified to declare a
person dead.
   Ms. Stringfellow, who is 88 years old and blind, appeared to
lose consciousness on Aug. 5 at a Springfield boarding home where
she was a resident. The owner, Robbie Caldwell, said Ms.
Stringfellow had no pulse.
   When Dennis L. Porter, director of the Dennis L. Porter Funeral
Home, arrived to pick up the body, Ms. Stringfellow was slumped
over in a chair and appeared to be dead.
   Porter took Ms. Stringfellow to his funeral home and was
preparing to move her to the embalming table when she uttered a
sound. He said it was ``a very eerie feeling.''
   ``I heard that the man had taken me to embalm me, was getting
his tools ready, I started talking, and he broke and run,'' she
said in the interview. ``I laughed about that.''
   Ms. Stringfellow was hospitalized for about a week and then
transferred to Odd Fellows Rebekah Home, a nursing center where she
still resides.
   She said she was told about the incident by a doctor a few days
later.
   ``He told me they had me dead,'' she said. ``I said, `What?' He
said, `Yeah, they had you dead, sure enough.' I said, `I ain't
dead.' I must have been off in a trance or something like that. I
didn't believe it. I didn't pay him too much attention.''
   But she believed a nephew who confirmed the incident the next
day.
   In the wake of the incident, Ohio Attorney General Anthony J.
Celebrezze Jr. asked a Clark County court to keep the boarding home
from being operated as a nursing home. The action was dropped after
Ms. Caldwell agreed to remove residents who required skilled
nursing care.
   The case also led to a review of state medical rules requiring
only that a ``competent observer'' personally examine a body before
death is pronounced.
   ``We felt very strongly ... that competent observers should be
more definitely defined as someone who has the proper medical
training,'' said Kay Reitz, an aide to state Sen. David Hobson, who
has led the reform effort.
   A rule was drafted for the State Medical Board defining
``competent observers'' as registered nurses, licensed practical
nurses, emergency medical technicians, paramedics, interns and
residents, clinical fellows, and licensed embalmers and funeral
directors who complete courses in patient assessment.
   Board spokeswoman Lauren Lubow said the board is expected to
vote on the proposed rule soon, possibly in March.
   Ms. Stringfellow said she isn't angry or upset about what
happened to her.
   ``I couldn't blame them for thinking I was dead,'' she said.
   She said she isn't frightened by what happened but guesses that
people probably have been embalmed alive before.
   ``If he ever started to work on me, I would have been dead,''
she said. ``Thank God, I wasn't dead that time.''
   Ms. Stringfellow spends her time listening to television,
talking with friends and visiting with family. Barbara Trimble,
director of the nursing home, said Ms. Stringfellow has a good
number of visitors.
   ``She's a riot,'' said Ms. Trimble. ``She's wonderful.''

   A kindergarten teacher near retirement
breaks up a fight among her pupils and ends up on Florida's
computer list of ``confirmed'' child abusers.
   A father of seven, twice named his school's teacher of the year,
brings in clothes for a needy student. Other teachers find the girl
trying on a blouse in the cloakroom of a nearby classrooom, and he
ends up on the list.
   Those were two ``horror stories'' a teachers union attorney told
a task force formed to study how the state handles child abuse
accusations against parents, teachers and other caretakers.
   Both teachers cleared their names, but not before they _ like
other innocent teachers _ were hurt by the system, said Elizabeth
DuFresne, an attorney for United Teachers of Dade.
   ``We have had in Dade County in the last two years, six teachers
... lose their homes while suspended without pay, three marriages
break up, an entire emotional deterioration of one teacher who
ultimately was justified on every single ground,'' Ms. DuFresne
said.
   The last example was a kindergarten teacher planning her
retirement after 37 years in the classroom. The woman, who broke up
a kindergarten fight, ``literally couldn't handle being accused,''
Ms. DuFresne said.
   Last year in Dade County, 57 teachers faced abuse investigations
after breaking up fights, she said.
   Ms. DuFresne was one of several education representatives at
public hearings throughout Florida in recent months to urge the
task force to recommend that lawmakers change the way the Florida
Abuse Registry works.
   Access to the registry is limited to Health and Rehabilitative
Services investigators, police and prosecutors, who use the
computer list to keep confirmed abusers out of caretaker jobs such
as work in day-care centers. Public schools do not use the list for
screening _ the task force wants to change the system so they will
_ but teachers, like any other caregiver including parents, can be
put on the list.
   Educators say the registry violates the constitutional rights of
the accused, listing them as confirmed abusers without a hearing,
and even in some cases listing them for incidents of
school-sanctioned paddling. Appeals cost thousands of dollars and
take months, often while a teacher is suspended without pay.
   ``Confirmed'' abusers remain on file for 50 years, ``indicated''
abuse cases for seven years and ``unfounded reports'' for a year.
   Last week, the task force decided to recommend changing the
``confirmed'' classification to ``proposed confirmed'' while people
accused of abuse go through an administrative appeals process
lasting no longer than 140 days.
   The panel also decided to propose changing some ``indicated''
case classifications to ``indicated, undetermined perpetrator.''
   Ms. DuFresne cited the case of the teacher who brought in the
used clothes for a 12-year-old girl whose home was damaged by fire.
After trying on a blouse in the teacher's absence, the girl, who
was in a class for children with emotional and learning problems,
was found getting back into her own clothes.
   The student said the teacher who gave her the clothes neither
watched her try them on nor touched her, but after two hours of
questioning she said she had been fondled, Ms. DuFresne said.
   The story changed again when Ms. DuFresne was taking a
deposition for criminal charges that had been brought against the
man. The girl got details mixed up and became upset, Ms. DuFresne
told the task force.
   ``She started crying,'' the attorney said. ``She said `They all
just wanted me to say something. I tried to say what they wanted me
to say. That's all.'''
   By that time the teacher had been out of the classroom for eight
months. The union had spent more than $30,000 in his defense, and
he had spent $5,000.
   Although the panel considered several aspects of child abuse, it
focused on the concerns of teachers and administrators, who make up
only a small percentage of those reported to the state and
confirmed as abusers.
   In fiscal year 1988-89, 132,805 abuse or neglect reports were
made to the state's Abuse Registry, according to B.J. Cosson,
director of Florida Protective Services System, which runs the
registry.
   Only 796 of the reports involved public school employees, most
of whom were teachers, and just 68 of those cases were
``confirmed'' cases of abuse.
   Linda Harris, an HRS attorney, defended the system as
constitutional, arguing that classification as a confirmed abuser
is not final until after the appeal process is concluded.
``Teachers aren't being singled out,'' she said.
   ``That was the special interest group that got heard from the
most,'' said
   Michael B. DeMaria, a psychologist specializing in child abuse,
said he sympathized with teachers but was concerned with the
emphasis on adults' rights as opposed to protection of children.
   ``We don't want to throw out the baby with the bath water,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Soviets Increased Violations of Swedish Waters, Rand Says</HEAD>

   Soviet submarines have illegally
entered Swedish waters in dramatically stepped-up operations since
Mikhail Gorbachev came to power, according to a study released
Sunday.
   In one case, a Soviet minisubmarine got as far as Stockholm
harbor, coming within a mile of the neutralo country's royal
palace, said the Rand Corp. report ``Strager Than Fiction: Soviet
Submarine Operations in Swedish Waters.''
   ``Despite what appears to be real Soviet progress in domestic
reform and arms control, this is still going on, and why the Swedes
continue to permit it, I don't know,'' said Gordon H. McCormick,
who wrote the report based on public documents and Swedish sources.
   The report was sponsored by the U.S. Air Force.
   The intrusions have harmed Gorbachev's attempt to change his
country's image in the West, but he is unlikely to scale back
operations unless he can demonstrate they are causing greater
difficulties for the Soviet Union in the West than has been the
case so far, McCormick said.
   Soviet submarines have penetrated Swedish waters since World War
II. But before the 1980s there were never more than four probable
intrusions a year, and those usually involved one submarine at a
time in outer coastal waters, the report said.
   ``Since 1980, Swedish sources indicate that an average rate of
between 17 and 36 foreign operations are being conducted per year,
depending on the degree of probability that is assigned to each
underwater contact,'' the report said.
   In addition, the new operations utilized multiple submarines,
minisubs and combat swimmers, and penetrated much deeper into
Sweden's coastal defense zones, including harbors of major naval
bases, the report said.
   Some intrusions made international headlines.
   In the 1981 ``Whiskey on the Rocks'' incident, a Soviet
Whiskey-class U-137 submarine ran aground near the Karlskrona naval
complex. Moscow termed it an accident, and after a confrontation
that lasted 10 days, the sub was released.
   In 1982, multiple submarines were identified deep within the
inner waters of Harsfjarden near Sweden's largest naval base.
   Covert onshore activity also has targeted the Swedish defense
establishment.
   The report cites a 1986 incident in which Soviet intelligence
agents posing as Polish art dealers visited the homes of 120
Swedish pilots, apparently to determine their identities. According
to Swedish authorities, it was part of a plan to decimate the Royal
Air Force in the event of war by gunning down the pilots in their
homes.
   The report said the greater frequency of submarine operations in
Sweden can be linked to Soviet suspicion of its status as a neutral
nation, and the increasing strategic value of the Scandinavian
peninsula in Soviet contingency war plans.
   Those plans apparently would involve crossing Sweden to reach
Norway, which is a NATO member, the report said.

<HEAD>Threatened Colombians Must Deal With Anxiety, Isolation</HEAD>

   For Colombians battling the drug
establishment, life is lived in a sealed, guarded box. Breaking out
can mean death at the hands of terrorists waiting patiently outside.
   Jaime Pardo Leal, the leftist Union Patriotic Party leader,
ventured out in 1987, only to be assassinated as he drove near his
farm west of Bogota.
   So stifling had his box become that Pardo ``said that life was
ending for him,'' said a friend, Bogota criminal court judge
Consuelo Herrera.
   ``He couldn't go to public places. He felt his intimacy with his
family was being destroyed by the presence of bodyguards and
security measures. Finally he couldn't take it any more and broke
out.''
   A normal reaction, psychologists say, for the politicians,
journalists, judges and others living under death threats from the
cocaine cartels.
   Often, a deadly one.
   Herrera said Pardo had begun to drive with his family to their
farm without first telling the national intelligence police, who
had been providing bodyguards for him.
   ``He was killed because he did not have the necessary
protection. He always said that he was not important enough for
anyone to try to kill him,'' Herrera said in an interview.
   So alarmed is the nation over death threats _ and the threat of
threats _ that executives have become accustomed to traveling with
bodyguards carrying submachine guns. Private guards wearing
bulletproof vests and dark glasses can often be seen standing
outside chic restaurants while their charges dine.
   Although Herrera said she had not been threatened, other judges
have. Thirty-six have been assassinated over the last 12 years.
   ``The first response by many people who have received a threat
is to try to put it out of their mind,'' Bogota psychologist
Leonidas Castro said in a recent interview.
   ``It is most important that people at risk take an active role
in protecting themselves, that they avoid the image of themselves
as helpless targets,'' said Castro, who specializes in treating the
stress and anxiety of high-risk officials. ``That feeling of
helplessness is the source for anxiety that can be as bad or worse
than the threat itself.''
   Many threatened Colombians, Herrera said, ``feel alone and won't
talk about the problem, but I've seen their worry and fear affect
their families like a poison.''
   One journalist who had received several threats said that, at
first, he felt the problem was not ``radical enough'' to cause him
to change his lifestyle.
   Later, though, he relayed the threats to the intelligence
police, who said they had evidence that a contract had been put out
on his life. He left the country.
   Judges don't usually have that option.
   ``For judges, leaving the country or installing a home security
system is rarely an option,'' said Herrera, ``We will often have to
fight a major battle just to get an extra government bodyguard for
a threatened judge.''
   Indeed, even affording psychological help can be difficult for
judges, who earn an average of $380 a month but who would have to
pay $25 to $100 an hour, by Castro's estimate, to see a
psychologist.
   Although judges handling drug cases should take threats
seriously, Colombians not directly involved with the cartels need
not live in fear, Castro said.
   ``A Colombian bank president who has not received any specific
threat can lead a perfectly normal life,'' the psychologist said.

   In this textile center, the Solidarity
trade union collects used clothing for the poor, buys sugar
wholesale to sell cheaply to workers and helps determine which
managers the government should fire.
   ``We control everything in town and are trying to get involved
in everything,'' said Zbigniew Ragan, a Solidarity leader at the
state-owned Revolution of 1905 Textile Factory, which turns out
linen fabric, tablecloths and napkins that are popular in Poland
and abroad.
   But he concedes that his membership is only a fraction of what
it was during Solidarity's heyday in 1981. And some workers may
lose their jobs because of the policies of the Solidarity-led
government of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki.
   Preparing for its first nationwide congress in nine years, the
East bloc's first independent trade union is striving to sink new
roots among a work force hard-hit by Poland's rough transition from
Communist economics.
   Ideally, Ragan and other leaders say, they should be
concentrating their energies on defending workers' economic
interests.
   But for now, they say, Poland's economic crisis is too dire and
the victory over the old Communist order still too fragile for
Solidarity to flex its muscles as an aggressive trade union.
   Instead the union is acting as a ``shield'' to protect its
government from workers' complaints, says Jan Zak, chairman of the
Solidarity chapter at the Zyrardow Technical Fabrics Factory, which
makes synthetic fabrics for industrial uses.
   Solidarity in 1981 registered 14,000 members in Zyrardow _ a
city of 41,000 people 30 miles southwest of Warsaw _ compared with
2,000 members today, Ragan said.
   The same trend holds true nationwide. In 1981, Solidarity was 10
million strong, more than half of Poland's adult work force. That
was before the martial law that turned Solidarity into a banned
organization for eight years.
   Membership is expected to be no more than 2.5 million by the
time of the congress April 19-24, said Krzysztof Wyszkowski,
political editor at the Solidarity weekly newspaper Tygodnik
Solidarnosc. That is less than the 6-million-strong unions formed
by the Communist Party while Solidarity was banned.
   Ragan and Zak said the lower membership has more to do with
apathy and finances than disenchantment with their reborn union.
Many people simply cannot spare Solidarity's annual dues of 1
percent of income, they contend, but in any decisive conflict
workers support Solidarity.
   Meanwhile, with a Solidarity government in power and Communists
in retreat, the union has greater influence than ever, Ragan said.
   Despite sharply rising prices and no wage increases, workers are
not striking against the Solidarity-led government, Zak noted. But
they do worry about job security.
   There are plans for layoffs, Ragan said. If it cannot prevent
them, Solidarity hopes to find new jobs for those laid off.
   While muting criticism of the government, local Solidarity
officials seek other ways to help members. At the Revolution of
1905 Factory, Solidarity last year realized it could save workers
money on sugar by buying it for them directly from a sugar beet
refinery, bypassing Poland's food-store monopoly.
   At the nearby Linen Industry Development Center, Solidarity
Chairwoman Mieczyslawa Jednejewska says her 48-member local is
involved in reorganizing the institute. But it also collects
clothes for the needy and makes loans to pensioners that probably
never will be repaid.
   ``People write us saying they don't have enough money to buy
dinner,'' she explains.
   The upcoming Solidarity congress will be the first chance to
gauge the rank-and-file's mood on a nationwide scale, and the depth
of support for Chairman Lech Walesa and the National Executive
Commission that has directed the union in recent years in the
absence of an elected leadership since 1981.
   Walesa said recently he plans to step down as union leader.
   Solidarity's political struggle with the Communists _ which led
to the selection of longtime union activist Mazowiecki as the East
bloc's first non-Communist leader _ has pushed union organizing to
the back burner.
   Now, many top union leaders and experts of 1980-81 are to be
found not in the factories, but in the government, in Parliament,
or in the Citizen's Committees, Solidarity's political wing.
   In the name of Poland's long-term national interests, they are
enacting a stringent program to reform the economy that strikes
hardest at the very industrial workers who created Solidarity.
   Walesa unites the trade union and the political currents in
Solidarity, but it is becoming increasingly hard for him to hold
the two together, Wyszkowski said.
   Although most Solidarity workers still support the government,
leaders such as Warsaw Region Chairman Michal Boni say the union
must be free to ``work out its own identity'' and they do not rule
out ``a quarrel with the government.''
   Walesa himself increasingly speaks of withdrawing Solidarity
from politics and giving it a strictly trade union function, ``to
protect the interests of the working people.''
   What is not clear, Wyszkowski said, is whether Walesa wants to
lead such a strict trade union or whether he would prefer embarking
openly on a political career, by seeking to replace Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski as president.
   Walesa may ``move to Belvedere (the presidential palace),
leaving the trade union to protect the workers,'' he said.

   The little boy cringed in fear when a
155mm howitzer shell crashed near the battle-scarred Hotel Dieu
Hospital, the largest in Christian east Beirut.
   His mother, sitting at his bedside, poured fruit juice from a
thermos with a Batman logo and tried to calm him.
   ``Don't worry, Camille,'' she said. ``It's only thunder. They're
the cannons of God. They don't hurt.''
   ``But it's not raining mother,'' the boy muttered.
   The comforting lie no longer works in Lebanon, where the shells
have been falling for nearly 15 years of civil war between Moslems
and Christians.
   This time, Christian is killing Christian as troops of renegade
Gen. Michel Aoun battle those of warlord Samir Geagea's Lebanese
Forces for control of the Christian sector.
   Camille is one of 150 patients crowded into the fetid corridors
of the French-financed Hotel Dieu.
   Alain Tessier, the hospital's French director, said 190
casualties had been brought in over the last 13 days, 21 of them
dead on arrival.
   More than 450 people have been killed and 1,700 wounded since
the bloodletting began Jan. 30.
   ``The hospital staff gave their blood to the wounded,'' said Dr.
Pierre Farah, a surgeon.
   Some of the wounded died because ambulances could not get them
to the hospital through the embattled streets, he said.
   ``Some had lost limbs, others were badly burned,'' he said
wearily. ``They just got here too late.''
   Those who make it to the hospital past the shellfire and snipers
have to clamber up a rickety wooden ladder over the back wall
because the main entrance is too exposed.
   Patients hooked to serum and plasma tubes lie on beds lining
both sides of the corridors on the hospital's first floor and the
undergound shelter.
   Among the wounded is a Lebanese Forces fighter, whose left leg
was blown off Feb. 1 by an army shell in nearby Ein Rummaneh.
   The militiaman, who did not want to give his name, said: ``I was
crying for help, but no one could get to me because of the
shelling. Finally, my neighbors came out of their shelter and
dragged me in until they could find a car to take me to hospital.''
   The hospital has been hit by 15 shells. Doctors and nurses
evacuated patients from the top two floors because they were so
exposed.
   ``We couldn't count how many shells fell in the gardens because
it's imposssible to climb on the roof and see. There are too many
snipers,'' Tessier said.
   The hospital stands on the edge of the residential district of
Ashrafiyeh, a Geagea stronghold ringed by Aoun's troops to the
east, Beirut's dividing Green Line to the southeast and the
Mediterranean to the north.
   The hospital is running low on just about everything, bread,
oxygen, antibiotics and blood. However, Tessier said the Red Cross
brought 2,200 gallons of water and some bread a couple of days ago
during a lull.
   Hospital workers risked their lives to drive to the summer
resort of Bikfaya in the mountains 12 miles northeast of
Ashrafiyeh, to get eggs and meat.
   The morgue is overflowing with bodies because families of the
slain have not been able to get through to retrieve them. The
hospital's last well-equipped ambulance was blasted by a shell on
Saturday.
   All roads leading into Ashrafiyeh are mined except for an
overpass from Moslem west Beirut 50 yards from the hospital. Locals
call it ``the ramp of death'' because anyone traversing it has to
run a gauntlet of sniper fire.
   A doctor said at least three people a day are shot on that road
trying to get to the hospital. The body of a man lies in fetal
position beside a white Mercedes. Another is slumped over the wheel
of his Plymouth.
   Other burned-out cars, including a Lebanese Red Cross van,
litter the street. Nobody stops to count how many dead there are in
them. Drivers step on the gas on this stretch.
   The International and Lebanese Red Cross have evacuated at least
50 wounded from Hotel Dieu. Sixteen were sent to France for
treatment in a mission organized by Bernard Kouchner, France's
minister for humanitarian aid.
   One was Micheleen Baruta, who lost an eye. Her mother, who
worked at the hospital, was killed by gunfire as she drove the girl
to Hotel Dieu.

<HEAD>Exploring Last Frontier of Lincoln's Life in Fading Courthouse
Files</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The fading angular script spills across
a brittle page of the leather-bound courthouse docket, seemingly a
mundane entry in an obscure chapter of frontier justice.
   But it is signed ``Lincoln.''
   The signature makes the 138-year-old notation a small piece in
the historical mosaic being assembled by researchers tracing the
law career of Abraham Lincoln, who was born 181 years ago today.
   ``Without exaggeration, it's fair to say that this is the last
real gap in documenting the life of Lincoln,'' said Cullom Davis,
director of the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency's Lincoln
Legal Papers project.
   ``Historians are always uncovering new documents of Lincoln, but
not very many. What's different about this project is that nothing
has been systematically unearthed and published about his law
practice. That's all there's left to do as far as documenting
Lincoln.''
   Lincoln practiced law from 1837, when the 28-year-old
self-educated attorney arrived in the muddy frontier town of
Springfield, until 1861. Then, he turned his law practice over to
his partner of 16 years, William Herndon, and boarded a train for
Washington, the White House and the Civil War.
   In 24 years as a lawyer, he handled disputes about stolen hogs
and bad debts, complex appellate cases for railroads, and cases
involving the corporate giants of the frontier. He took more than
260 cases before the Illinois Supreme Court, where his was among
the dominant practices of the time, and gained a reputation as a
writer of forceful, succinct briefs.
   Yet among the approximately 10,000 books on Lincoln, few have
given thorough, accurate treatment to his legal career, Davis said.
   Popular accounts portray a humble horse-and-buggy lawyer
dispensing homespun wisdom as he rode from courthouse to
courthouse. A modern legal scholar, William Prosser, dismissed
Lincoln's practice as ``rather petty and uninspiring.''
   The Lincoln Legal Papers project, begun in 1985 and expected to
take a decade or more, seeks to assemble a copy of every obtainable
document from cases involving Lincoln, an estimated 70,000 papers.
   The complete record will be published on microfilm for sale to
libraries.
   But assembling that record is a daunting task.
   Davis estimates that Lincoln handled up to 3,000 cases, but
fewer than 400 have been documented. The paper chase is complicated
by the brisk trade in Lincoln documents since his 1865
assassination.
   ``Lawyers have them hanging on their walls, they exist in
obscure little libraries that somehow came to own them, manuscript
dealers trade in these things all the time,'' Davis said.
   Persuading the owners of such documents to come forward is often
difficult, Davis said, because many were originally stolen from
court files or law firms. Even Lincoln's law partner systematically
filched documents from Illinois courthouses after Lincoln's
assassination, though his plunder is now in the Library of Congress.
   Much of the new information about Lincoln's legal career almost
certainly will be assembled by combing the files of the Illinois
county courthouses where he practiced.
   The tedious search began earlier this month in the Menard County
courthouse at Petersburg, about 20 miles northwest of Springfield.
Equipped with a portable photocopier and a computerized index of
Lincoln's known cases, two researchers are scrutinizing virtually
every court case from the Lincoln era.
   Menard County is expected to be a particularly rich source
because it includes the site of New Salem, the village where
Lincoln once lived. The area was home to many of his friends and
acquaintances.
   ``When my boss asks me how long I'll be here, I just shrug,''
said Joanne Wallroth, a Yale-trained documentary editor who
identified 20 previously unknown Lincoln cases in her first week at
the courthouse.
   A typical case from the period finds Lincoln representing Mentor
Graham, New Salem's schoolteacher, in a lawsuit seeking repayment
of a debt of $15.83 from one Jacob Bale. The case dragged on for
two years before Lincoln won a judgment for his client and a fee of
$19.90 for himself.
   As Lincoln's practice grew more sophisticated, so did the legal
system. Because of that parallel, Davis said, the research will
give historians an insight on the development of the American legal
system.
   The study also is expected to uncover the ways that Lincoln's
parallel careers as lawyer and politician shaped one another.
   ``If Lincoln hadn't won the presidency in 1860 and had finished
out his life as a practicing attorney ... he probably would have
gone down as one of the great practitioners of the bar in the
mid-19th century,'' Davis said.
   ``But that's nothing compared to what he in fact became.''

   Harbor pilots at the Port of Los Angeles on
Sunday ended a two-day walkout that had crippled the nation's
second-busiest port, agreeing to a settlement that left open the
possibility of more talks.
   The pact between the city Harbor Department and representatives
of the 11-member pilots union contains no salary agreement, but
scheduled a meeting Tuesday on wages, said port spokeswoman Julia
Nagano.
   ``The pickets are being pulled and the pilots are returning to
work,'' she said.
   She added that no retribution would be taken against the pilots.
   The pilots went on strike Saturday to protest what they called
perilous working conditions that could cause a worse oil spill than
the one off Huntington Beach on Wednesday that continued
threatening the Southern California coast.
   They also had demanded a 50 percent pay increase, port officials
said.
   Only one ship steered out of the port earlier Sunday as
dockworkers honored pilots' picket lines, with management handling
pilot duties. Another ship cancelled plans to do leave, while four
others were moored inside or outside the port's breakwater,
awaiting berthing.
   Under the agreement, the Harbor Department said it would allow
pilots to refuse to perform a ship maneuver if they feel it is
unsafe, said Wallace Knox, attorney for Local 68 of the
International Organization of Masters, Mates and Pilots.
   The pilots had argued that port authorities were using
overworked, undertrained personnel.
   Pilots also had argued that they were making 50 percent less
than their colleagues nationwide. They had sought to eliminate the
difference over a period of years, Knox said.
   The city had offered a 4 percent, one-year raise.
   Officials from the Harbor Department were not available Sunday
night to comment on the terms of the agreement.
   When both sides meet Tuesday, representatives of the
dockworkers' union and the shipping industry's Pacific Maritime
Association will be on hand as observers, Knox said.
   The pilots' walkout was the first strike at the port since the
1970s, when a dockworkers' walkout shut down the port for more than
a week.
   The port occupies more than 7,500 acres, making it one of the
world's largest manmade harbors. It handled more than 2 million
cargo containers last year, making it the second-busiest port in
the United States behind New York-New Jersey.

<HEAD>Why Call Your Lover `Sugar Pie' When `Picklepuss' Will Do?</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Valentine's Day draws nigh, the treacle
begins to flow. Can anybody explain why lovers call each other
``sweetheart'' or ``sugar pie'' or ``honeybun'' or other sweet
nothings?
   Why not ``picklepuss'' or ``liverlips?''
   Anthropologist Sidney Mintz of The Johns Hopkins University has
some theories on why humans evoke the imagery of sweetness to
express affection.
   Possibly, our fondness for sweet talk can be traced genetically
to our primate ancestors, who discovered the delights of juicy
jungle fruits as they swung from tree to tree, he says.
   Perhaps it is associated somehow with the infant's innate love
for the sweetness of mother's milk, he says. In America, it might
even be reinforced by the high sugar intake in our fast-food,
candy-nibbling culture.
   While lecturing in Paris on the link between sweetness and
sensuality, Mintz says, ``it struck me as curious that all the
words we use to describe love and warmth and good feelings are
derived from the sweetness end of the spectrum of taste, not the
sour, bitter, salty or hot.''
   ``Even the word `sweet' has its root in the ancient
Indo-European word for `persuade,' so when we sweet-talk somebody,
that's what it really is,'' he said.
   Sweetness is associated with the language of love in the Bible
and the Kama Sutra. Chaucer wrote of ``my sweet cinnamon.'' The
clown in Shakespeare's ``As You Like It'' declares that ``honesty
coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.''
   And today, goodness is seen in the car engine that ``runs
sweetly'' and or the triumphs of Walter ``Sweetness'' Payton, the
great Chicago Bears running back.
   ``The candy associated with Valentine's Day brings together love
and sweetness in a very striking way,'' says Mintz, who has written
a book titled ``Sweetness and Power'' describing the role that
sugar has played in modern history.
   Sweets have an erotic nature that's undeniable, he says.
   ``What tends to be forgotten about sugar is its intensity, an
intensity that our bodies are immediately aware of,'' Mintz says.
``What do you experience with your first mouthful of a hot fudge
sundae? It's not surprising that we carry it over to describe the
intensity of love and sex.''
   The scrapbooks that Mintz keeps in his office document the
bizarre twists that sugar-fueled passion can take.
   There is a picture of Etienne Tholoniat, a master French baker,
who created a lifelike female nude out of white chocolate with
spun-sugar hair, lying on a bed of 600 sugar roses.
   A clipping tells the story of a 30-year-old woman in Santa Cruz,
Calif., who covered her nude body with a chocolate glaze and,
posing as a chocolate Easter bunny, went ``hippity hoppity'' across
the front yard of a neighbor who had spurned her affections,
according to police. The neighbor called the cops, who took her
into custody after what was described as a ``sticky altercation.''
   Mintz, 67, says he's been happily married for 25 years to ``a
beautiful, brilliant woman'' named Jackie. They met on the campus
of Yale University, where he was teaching and she was a young
graduate student.
   He's called her ``sweetie pie'' ever since.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In eight short weeks, the new
leadership in Czechoslovakia has done more to establish new ties
abroad than its Communist predecessors did in decades.
   Under the guidance of former dissidents, President Vaclav Havel
and Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier, officials are working on
Havel's declared goal of restoring Czechoslovakia's status as ``the
spiritual crossroads of Europe.''
   Like much of Czechoslovakia's revolution, the process appears
almost effortless, as if planned years in advance.
   Dienstbier, dressed in an unaccustomed suit, shakes hands almost
daily with another foreign minister. He apologetically told a
Western reporter this week that March would be the best time for an
interview. He'll be away in Paris, Ottawa, Washington, Moscow and
Copenhagen until then.
   Rita Klimova _ known as the voice of the revolution for her
translation at opposition press conferences in November _ is off to
Washington as new ambassador.
   Despite being unable to travel for 20 years, these people
maintained contact in the hard times with Eastern European
dissidents or Western intellectuals, journalists and politicians.
In this country abounding in ironies, the dissidents were better
informed about thought abroad than other Czechoslovaks.
   When revolution propelled them to power, it was natural that
their friends abroad would flock to show good will toward the new
Czechoslovakia _ and perhaps invest in what many Western business
executives see as a coming boom in central Europe.
   The business and celebrity visitors, ranging from British
playwright Harold Pinter to American rock star Frank Zappa, are the
eye-catching part of the serious diplomatic business of putting
Czechoslovakia back on the world map.
   Havel made his first presidential visit not to Moscow, like his
Communist predecessors, but to East Berlin and Munich, lending
qualified support to German unification and trying to bury the
ghost of 1938, the Munich agreement that paved the way for Hitler's
invasion of Czechoslovakia.
   On his first weekend in office, Dienstbier joined Foreign
Minister Alois Mock of Austria in cutting Iron Curtain barbed wire
on their border, and repeated the same liberating act with Foreign
Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany days later.
   Last week, James A. Baker III became the first U.S. secretary of
state to visit Prague since 1973.
   ``It gave us credibility, which we really need,'' said Karel
Tucek, an adviser of the Civic Forum opposition that powered the
revolution.
   Tucek especially liked Baker's stress on getting the economy out
of state hands: ``After two months, we have so many businessmen and
investors trying to find out what they can do. But we have to wait
for Parliament to pass the laws.''
   Baker left, and Foreign Minister Moshe Arens of Israel arrived
to re-establish the diplomatic relations Czechoslovakia severed in
1967, following Moscow's lead.
   ``There were never so many visits in the last years as in these
weeks. Czechoslovakia is again an interesting country,'' Dienstbier
told Arens, with the understated humor of many of today's Prague
officials.
   Prague also swiftly followed Hungary in establishing ties with
South Korea, and emulated Poland and Hungary in pursuing relations
with the Vatican, inviting Pope John Paul II in April.
   In the reshaping of Eastern Europe into independent nations
acting in their own interest, Prague has already surged ahead of
its neighbors, benefiting perhaps from being later with its revolt
against the old Stalinist ways.
   It was the strident demand from Prague for the withdrawal of
Soviet troops this year that encouraged Hungary and Polish
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa to demand the same.
   At last month's summit of the ailing Soviet-led trading bloc
Comecon, it was Finance Minister Vaclav Klaus who gained attention
with his threat, later modified, to quit the organization unless it
changes radically.
   Havel journeyed to Poland and Hungary to propose that the three
countries meet to coordinate their re-entry into Europe.
   In this effort to change relations with the East _ Havel travels
to Moscow this month _ the Czechoslovak leaders can draw on old
ties with friends in Poland and Hungary.
   All share the philosophy that powered their dissent, the
creation of a society in which each individual takes responsibility
for his or her actions.
   The effort, outlined in Havel's New Year address, ``to bring a
new element into European and world politics'' by radiating love
and understanding also has Czechoslovakia looking in less
conventional directions than simply cultivating the West.
   Prague wants NATO and the Warsaw Pact to disappear. Havel has
offered to mediate between the Palestine Liberation Organization,
the Communists' Mideast friend, and Israel.
   Putting personal philosophy ahead of offending China, he
meditated with the Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama. And he
insisted on squeezing a visit to Iceland into his route to the
White House this month.
   There also is a refreshing informality to the efforts to restore
Czechoslovakia's standing and infuse new life into world diplomacy.
   Welcoming Arens, Dienstbier broke protocol and invited him to an
art exhibit by a man who was his cellmate during a prison term.
   Why were you in prison, Arens politely inquired. ``Undermining
of the Republic,'' answered Dienstbier, chuckling.

   It's Jan. 18, 2006. Sarah, a 77-year-old widow
living with her son in Wheeling, W.Va., wakes up as a bedside video
screen plays sequences of classical music.
   She uses her videophone to activate the kitchen coffee maker
from her bed for her son, and then switches the music to his
bedside screen and turns on a morning news show. When her son
leaves for work she goes back to watching the news, which has been
on hold since she left it.
   She dons a medical bracelet and plugs it into the videophone for
a postoperative checkup from her heart surgery.
   Later, according to a futurist scenario envisioned by the Bell
Atlantic telephone company, she leaves an audio-video message for a
friend, listens to a ``talking'' book club and, when she goes to
bed, programs an emergency pager that will, if need be, track down
her son by phone.
   Bell Atlantic says the whiz-bang gadgets ``Sarah'' will take for
granted are technically feasible now and could be in the average
American's home by the end of the century.
   But first, Bell Atlantic and the other regional Bell companies
say, they've got to get the government off their backs.
   Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., took a step in that direction
Friday when he unveiled a bill to loosen the restrictions on
information services and equipment manufacturing placed on the Bell
companies in the 1984 consent decree that broke up the American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
   Previous efforts to free the Bells have gone nowhere in
Congress. Opponents fear that unrestrained Bell companies could use
their enormous resources to drive out competition by limiting phone
access and by cross-subsidizing their new and riskier business
ventures with their heavy local telephone earnings.
   But Markey, whose bill joins a similar measure introduced by
Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., says it is time to defend U.S.
telecommunications leadership against intense foreign competition.
   Markey's bill would give the Federal Communications Commission
the oversight powers held by U.S. District Judge Harold Greene, who
continues to enforce the 1984 consent decree.
   Greene in 1986 gave the Bells permission to transmit information
services such as videotext, computer data bases, financial
information and reservation and shopping services, but would not
allow them to control the content of such services.
   Markey's bill would allow the Bell companies, among other
things, to provide through non-joint venture subsidiaries:
   _Distribution of information services outside their calling
territories.
   _Electronic ``yellow pages'' directories _ excluding classified
advertising _ to be updated monthly for two years.
   _Emergency public safety services such as enhanced 911 calling.
   _Research, design and development of telecommunications
equipment and, under certain conditions, equipment manufacturing.
   The bill contains mechanisms designed to prevent cross-subsidies
and other anticompetitive practices, but allows the FCC to waive
the separate subsidiary requirement after three years. The
information service restrictions do not apply when a Bell company
owns 5 percent or less of an information services company.
   Initial reaction from the Bell companies to the bill was
cautiously optimistic. BellSouth described it as ``another
significant step toward bringing America up to speed in
telecommunications,'' while Bell Atlantic said it was ``another
clear signal that Congress recognizes the need to address
telecommunications policy for the nation.''
   However, Gene Kimmelman, legislative director of the Consumer
Federation of America, was hesitant.
   ``This is a valiant effort to limit ratepayer risks, but it is
not clear that the bill provides more concrete consumer benefits
than current law. We're still skeptical of the need for this kind
of legislation,'' Kimmelman said.
   MCI Communications Corp. said the bill was ``unneeded and will
set back America's preeminence and global leadership in
telecommunications.''
   Although the consent decree didn't specifically mention cable
television in the information services ban, court interpretations
have included cable in that ban.
   Owning cable TV service is crucial to the Bells' plan to wire
the nation with fiber-optic cable that could make a ``Sarah''
household a reality. But the cable industry is adamant about
keeping the phone companies out of their business, and the Markey
bill does not change the cable TV curbs.

<HEAD>Difficult Road Ahead For Mandela and De Klerk</HEAD>

   Black hopes. White fears.
   These are the crucial factors that Nelson Mandela and President
F.W. de Klerk must address as they set out on a precarious path in
the direction of democracy and reconciliation.
   For South African blacks, Mandela's release Sunday was cause for
unprecedented jubilation. Hundreds of thousands danced for joy in
the streets of their cities and townships, convinced at least
momentarily that their own political freedom was a big step closer.
   Many whites were far less happy. Liberal leaders lauded de Klerk
for boldness but businessmen and homeowners worried about a
possible upsurge of violence; police struck back hard at rowdy
black revelers, and right-wing politicans accused the president of
surrender.
   ``It's complete capitulation,'' said Koos van der Merwe,
spokesman for the pro-apartheid Conservative Party, when he learned
Mandela would go free. ``When the time comes, and they want to
enforce black communist government on the whites, they will have to
do it by force. We won't accept it passively.''
   De Klerk, raised in a prominent Afrikaner family that believed
whites were destined to rule, is not yet on the brink of
capitulation. His proposals for power-sharing between blacks and
whites stop well short of the one-person, one-vote system demanded
by Mandela and the African National Congress.
   But the president's moves in the past 10 days have taken both
his supporters and opponents by surprise. When the cautious,
low-key politician took office in August, few South Africans would
have predicted he would transform the political landscape by
lifting a 30-year ban on the ANC, suspending executions, freeing
prominent prisoners, telling militant exiles they can come back
home.
   These moves have won an unusual degree of international goodwill
for South Africa, but de Klerk's standing among his own white
constituents may depend on whether the ANC is willing to meet him
part way with concessions of its own.
   The president's brother, liberal political analyst Willem de
Klerk, has met several times with ANC leaders and predicted in a
recent article that the movement would make compromises. These
might include official renunciation of violence and modifcations of
the ANC's socialist economic policy, he said.
   But Mandela, in his first speech since his 1964 treason trial,
told a huge crowd in Cape Town on Sunday that the time for
compromise had not arrived. He reaffirmed his support for the ANC's
guerrilla campaign and urged his followers to ``intensify the
struggle on all fronts.''
   He declared himself a ``loyal and disciplined member'' of the
ANC and said nothing to substantiate South African press
speculation that he might be at odds with some hard-line members of
his movement's exiled leadership.
   The speech was not likely to reassure uneasy whites but was
almost certain to be well-received in the townships, particularly
among young militants _ hardened by years of street battles with
police _ who might have been wondering if Mandela had mellowed.
   Mandela's only admonition to the youths was to be disciplined.
   ``I hope you will disperse with dignity,'' he said at the end of
an evening marred by clashes between looters and police. ``Not a
single one of you should do anything that which will make other
people say we can't control our own people.''
   Beyond the ranks of his own followers, Mandela faces the
challenge of resolving ANC feuds with other black factions to its
left and right. To many, he is the only South African capable of
this task.
   At the same time, he could boost the ANC's long-term prospects
by persuading a significant portion of the 5 million whites that
their future in a black-ruled South Africa would be secure. He
offered no specific inducements to whites on Sunday, but told them:
``The freedom movement is a political home for you, too.''
   Mandela has stated in the past that he is aware of whites' fears
of black domination. De Klerk has said repeatedly that he
understands blacks' desire for full political rights.
   If they can find ways to convert this awareness into steps that
make both blacks and whites feel more confident, then the ``new
South Africa'' that each man envisioned in their weekend speeches
might possibly materialize.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Keeping Nuclear Weapons Out of Extremists' Hands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union should conduct a
``fail-safe'' review of its 30,000 nuclear weapons to assure none
falls into the hands of extremists at a time of internal tumult,
the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee says.
   Sen. Sam Nunn isn't alone in his concern.
   With ethnic and political tensions straining Soviet unity, some
American experts are fretting about the possibility that a nuclear
missile could be loosed on the world without the knowledge or
approval of the Kremlin.
   ``My worst case fear for the last several months is that we
would wake up one morning and discover that an ethnic liberation
front had obtained control of 100 nuclear weapons,'' said a
military expert on the staff of the House Armed Services Committee.
   ``Nuclear weapons are in every Soviet republic that is
potentially rebellious,'' said the source, who asked not to be
identified by name.
   Bruce G. Blair of the Brookings Institution notes that the
Soviets may have 100 or so nuclear weapons stored near Baku, in
Soviet Azerbaijan, site of recent violent clashes between Muslims
and Armenians.
   Until Soviet troops entered Baku to restore order, widespread
reports had gunmen seizing arms and ammunition from Soviet military
depots.
   But Blair said U.S. government officials appear not to be
worried, ``based largely on their belief that the Soviets have a
penchant for tight, ironclad control of nuclear weapons.''
   The issue may soon be explored in extraordinary public fashion,
at a time the superpowers apparently are nearing agreement on
several arms control accords.
   Yevgeni Velikhov, chairman of the Supreme Soviet's defense
subcommittee, has proposed an unprecedented joint hearing with the
House Armed Services Committee to explore ways of reducing the
danger of unauthorized or accidental launches of nuclear weapons.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House panel, says he is
open to the idea.
   Nunn, D-Ga., said in an interview, ``I think you have to worry
about thousands of nuclear weapons in a nation that has a lot of
turmoil.''
   But he said that in an age of terrorism he also is concerned
about the security of U.S. nuclear weapons. He wants the Pentagon
to review controls on U.S. nuclear weapons and says his committee
will conduct its own review if the Pentagon fails to act.
   Nunn wants to persuade the Kremlin to review the effectiveness
of ``fail-safe'' procedures to insulate their nuclear weapons from
the country's political troubles. The two superpowers should
cooperate more closely on the issue because ``this is one area of
technology that it would pay both sides to share,'' he said.
   ``In the event of instability, people have to be worried about
who would be in charge,'' said Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a former
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   Like others, Lugar noted that a probable silver lining to their
worries is the continued cohesiveness of the Soviet military
machine.
   ``There seems to be no instability whatsoever in the Soviet
armed forces,'' Lugar said. ``They appear to be in full control of
nuclear weapons, short- or long-range.''
   The Soviets have an intricate and extensive security system to
protect their nuclear weapons, placing missile sites in remote
locations, surrounding heir perimeters with heavy guard forces
prepared to use deadly force, installing multiple launch controls.
   The official at the House Armed Services Committee said: ``We do
know you can't just walk into a Soviet missile silo and fire
them.'' But he added the equation might change if an ethnic faction
seized control of an entire province.
   For Sen. Joseph R. Biden, D-Del., chairman of the Foreign
Relations European subcommittee, the concern is not that a faction
in Bulgaria or East Germany might obtain nuclear weapons and use
them.
   ``It is more in whether the military comes to conclude that
Gorbachev's policies don't make any sense,'' he said. ``But I have
trouble with that scenario. The Soviets are so careful with their
control of nuclear weapons.''

   Moviemaker George Lucas was pretty
much on target with Indiana Jones, according to the former Baptist
preacher whose archaeological treks inspired the movie character.
   But Vendyl Jones, founder of the Institute for Judaic-Christian
Research in Arlington, Texas, said the movie character has ``just a
little bit more sex than I have in my life.''
   Jones, 59, said that on a trip during the 1960s a writer
accompanied him to do research for a story. It was that story that
eventually made its way to Lucas, who turned it into the Indiana
Jones movies.
   The former pastor of Dungan Chapel Baptist Church near
Elizabethton in eastern Tennessee said the movies ``Raiders of the
Lost Ark,'' ``Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,'' and ``Indiana
Jones and the Last Crusade'' taught people about the ark of the
covenant ``better than any preacher.''
   Jones said he has had to contend with collapses, cave-ins and
bigger boulders than Indian Jones encountered, but he doesn't know
how close he is to finding the ark, the chest containing the two
stone tablets inscribed with the Ten Commandments.
   He said in a recent telephone interview that the movie has given
him somewhat of an image problem.
   ``I don't come in with a bullwhip and a pistol. I leave them
both in my car,'' he explained.

   John Appleton got an unlikely replay
when he was summoned for jury duty. The defendant was the same man
Appleton helped convict during his last jury stint 14 years ago.
   Superior Court Judge James Morris said Appleton told the court
during jury selection Wednesday that he remembered the defendant,
James Richard Turner, from the last trial.
   ``What are the odds of that happening?'' Morris said. Appleton
``said that was the only other time he served on a jury, and I
don't believe Turner has had any other jury trials since then.''
   Morris said Turner recognized Appleton from the 1976 jury that
acquitted him of contributing to the delinquency of a minor but
found him guilty of possessing marijuana.
   ``He said he'd be willing to have Appleton again as a juror,''
the judge said.
   However, defense and prosecuting attorneys agreed to excuse
Appleton from the panel hearing assault and marijuana growing
charges against Turner.
   The results were no better the second time around for Turner. On
Friday, the jury returned a guilty verdict.

   When the sun beats down on this remote
corner of Maine this summer, campers will refresh their parched
throats with drinks cooled by ice cut months earlier from the
sprawling lake glistening at their doorsteps.
   Steve Philbrick and his hearty band of ice harvesters, men more
committed to preserving a tradition than making a buck, have seen
to that.
   With 5-foot steel saws, iron chisels, metal-tipped pick poles
and brute strength, Philbrick and his seven men carved 2,000 blocks
from the 2-foot slab covering Mooselookmeguntic Lake while winter
was in its arctic prime.
   They stacked mountains of light blue ice between layers of
sawdust in two well-insulated icehouses, which will remain sealed
tight until blocks are removed during summer.
   Much of the ice will be used at the resort Philbrick runs,
providing refrigeration in its kitchen and a convenient cooler for
the guests renting cabins strung along the shore in this western
Maine community. Philbrick, who also sells ice blocks, has one of
the few commercially viable ice harvesting operations left.
   His band attack the work with vigor, enthusiasm and wit.
   ``I'd rather do this any day than sit in the house,'' said Ray
Christy, whose house-moving business slows down during winter.
``We're keeping the old times flowing, the tradition going. I'll do
it as long as (Philbrick) does.''
   ``It's something that's not done much any more and you want to
be part of it,'' said Bob Brown, a transplanted New Jersey
draftsman, who also runs a local computer shop and bakery. ``I'd
rather be here sawing ice than down there making more money.''
   A century ago, Maine was famous for the crystal-clear chunks it
exported all over the world, said Richard Judd, an assistant
professor of history at the University of Maine.
   Around 1880, the peak of Maine's ice trade, up to 1 million tons
a year were cut in Maine, mostly from river valleys in southern
Maine. The ice, which made excellent ballast for clippers, was
loaded between layers of straw and sawdust and carried to ports in
the South, the Caribbean, South America and beyond, said Judd.
   As ice harvesting all but vanished, a few old timers who had cut
it in their younger days passed their skills to younger men
interested in preserving the craft.
   Philbrick, 36, remembers cutting ice every winter during his
youth with his grandfather, Ronnie Turmenne, who is now 85 and cut
ice until five years ago. In Turmenne's prime, ``he did four or
five times the scale'' of the current operation, said Philbrick.
   ``I was brought up with it,'' said Philbrick.
   Twice a day during summer, Philbrick fills 10-gallon pails with
chopped ice at each of his resort's 15 cabins so guests can keep
their drinks and snacks cool. The ice also provides refrigeration
in the main kitchen, which serves three meals a day, saving money
and assuring Philbrick that his coolers won't break down.
   Philbrick also sells ice to a local salmon hatchery that uses it
to regulate water temperature, and to anyone willing to pay $7 for
blocks about the size of four cinder blocks.
   Philbrick, who also works as a ski patroller, says it would cost
more to buy, maintain and purchase electricity for refrigerators
than to run his ice-cutting operation. He says his ice business is
``profitable.''
   Working over 60 feet of water as a light snow fell, Philbrick
and his crew reenacted a scene that would have been common a
century ago, muscling saws whose 1{-inch teeth slashed through the
ice.
   They hang on to the traditional methods most of the way,
borrowing modern contrivances sparingly.
   After plowing a broad swath clear of snow, they push a
60-year-old motor-driven circular saw over the ice, creating a
checkerboard pattern of 16-inch squares. The saw, which only cuts
about halfway through the ice, used a Model T engine until 25 years
ago, said Philbrick.
   Once a sluice that will lead to a wooden conveyor is also cut
out of the ice, the brawn takes over, as men saw along the lines of
the grid through the remaining foot of ice.
   As the ice blocks are chipped free by the chisels, they are
guided by men wielding pick poles to the conveyor, whose oak slats
guide the mammoth blocks to a truck.
   Brown, grabbing the chunks with iron tongs and stacking them up
in the truck, appeared disappointed as the final blocks were guided
from the square hole in the lake.
   ``We're about the only people left doing this,'' he mused.

<HEAD>Rural Power Cooperatives Oppose Proposed REA Budget Cuts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rural power cooperatives are diving into
another fray in Congress over attempts to pull the plug on direct
loans by the venerable Rural Electrification Administration.
   The REA, an agency of the Agriculture Department, has poured
billions into financing the electrification of rural America since
the mid-1930s. Critics say the agency's job is done and it should
use the commercial money market entirely.
   President Bush's budget proposal sent to Congress two weeks ago
continues to promote a shift from direct loans by REA to guaranteed
loans by private lenders.
   Direct electric loans in the fiscal year that will begin Oct. 1
would be cut to $200 million from more than $1.4 billion currently,
including $622 million by REA and $813 million by the Federal
Financing Bank.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter told reporters after the
Bush budget was released that most REA borrowers ``now are very
strong and commercially powerful organizations that should be able
to handle most of their financial needs'' through commercial
lenders and guarantees.
   Speaking Feb. 5 at the annual meeting of the National Rural
Electric Cooperative Association in Orlando, Fla., Yeutter told
more than 12,000 rural leaders that Bush is not trying to kill off
the REA.
   ``There will be no more confrontational mode,'' he said. ``That
will never happen during the Bush administration.''
   The association, the Washington-based lobby for 1,000 rural
electric systems serving about 25 million people in 46 states, is
the REA's chief surrogate warrior in the annual budget battles.
   Bob Bergland is the association's executive vice president and
was secretary of agriculture in the Carter administration. He
pledged an aggressive Capitol Hill campaign to block the REA budget
cuts proposed by Bush.
   ``We will never agree to any change that will result in a
degrading of the quality of our service or an increase in the cost
to our consumers,'' Bergland told the group's 48th annual meeting.
   The association said Bush ``resurrected a number of budget
suggestions offered repeatedly _ and unsuccessfully _ by President
Reagan,'' including straight-line amortization of hydropower
project debt, and market rates for power sold through U.S. power
marketing agencies. Federal power is now sold at cost.

   This is the big season for smuggled birds, and
the Agriculture Department says the public should beware.
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, said every year from January
through early spring, hundreds of exotic birds enter the United
States illegally after the winter breeding season.
   The most popular foreign specimens are the ``hookbilled''
varieties, such as the yellow-naped Amazon, often sold by street
vendors.
   ``These smuggled birds often carry such diseases as exotic
Newcastle without showing symptoms,'' Glosser said. ``Since 1974,
there has been an outbreak of this disease in pet birds nearly
every year, although it has not spread to commercial poultry
flocks.''
   Exotic Newcastle disease is deadly to all birds and would be a
major problem for the poultry industry, he said.
   During an outbreak during the early 1970s, the disease in
Southern California cost taxpayers $56 million to eradicate. An
estimated 12 million birds, mostly laying hens, either died or were
destroyed.
   Glosser said if exotic Newcastle became established in the
United States, it could cost the poultry industry an estimated $230
million a year and increase the cost of eggs and poultry to
consumers.
   ``Pet dealers are putting their businesses at risk when they buy
smuggled birds,'' he said. ``Anyone who buys exotic birds in the
United States should make certain they purchase them from
legitimate sources.''
   Purchased birds should be wearing a circular, stainless steel,
USDA-approved leg band engraved with three letters and three
numbers.
   Glosser said smuggled birds infected by exotic Newcastle also
may cause ``minor health problems'' for people who handle them,
including eye inflammations.

   Brazil has made large strides in poultry
output and selling products overseas, but an Agriculture Department
report says economic problems are taking some of the bloom off the
country's export market.
   Poultry production doubled in the last 10 years, putting Brazil
fourth behind the United States, Soviet Union and China, the report
said. The increase was largely in response to consumer demand for
chicken, caused by shortages of red meat.
   Exports peaked in 1982 at 302,000 metric tons and then declined
before rebounding in 1988, the report said. Brazil's customers
include some targeted by U.S. exporters, including Japan and the
Middle East.
   Trade figures cited in the report showed that market shares of
the lucrative ``chicken parts'' export market in Japan have
increased recently for Brazil, Thailand, China and others at the
expense of the United States.
   In 1988, for example, the U.S. share of the Japanese market was
more than 45 percent. Last year it dropped to less than 39 percent.
   ``Although Brazil is commanding a respectable share in major
world poultry markets, the current economic situation in Brazil is
hurting its poultry export competitiveness,'' the report said.
   The main factor has been the overvaluation of Brazil's currency,
the New Cruzado, by almost twice the real rate, it said. That is
making Brazilian chickens relatively expensive to export, compared
with selling them domestically.

   The biological clock is ticking for
``Babe,'' a 36-year-old elephant who is expecting her first
offspring.
   The Asian elephant may be the oldest first-time mother in
captivity, Burnet Park Zoo officials say. Trainers worry she may
not know what to do when she delivers a 200-pound baby, due April
24.
   ``We're confident, but we're also aware something could go
wrong,'' said senior elephant trainer Chuck Doyle.
   Babe has gained 1,150 pounds since she became pregnant in June
1988. She tipped a truck scale at 7,450 pounds when she was weighed
by state police Jan. 24.
   ``She's a very, very nervous animal, and she's not real thrilled
about people,'' said Doyle, who suffered broken ribs during
attempts to mate Babe and Indy, the zoo's 18-year-old male
elephant. ``But throughout her pregnancy, she's gotten much more
sociable with the public and people in general.''
   Zoo officials plan to have a contest to name the baby, which
they say will weigh 150 to 200 pounds and be about 3 feet tall at
birth.

   Tens of thousands of people danced,
embraced and sang in the streets of this sprawling black township
to celebrate the freeing of their hero Nelson Mandela.
   ``Mandela is free! Mandela is home!'' shouted jubilant residents
of the black township of 2.5 million outside Johannesburg as word
of his release in Cape Town spread from street to street Sunday.
   Many people rushed to the modest Mandela house to celebrate his
freedom. He had been out of sight in jail for 27 years, but he had
never been out of mind for South Africans _ especially those in his
hometown of Soweto.
   People clasped each other in bear hugs and danced. A beaming
resident in a column of dancers yelled, ``Mandela is coming home!
Apartheid is dead!''
   Columns of exultant people waving the gold, green and black flag
of Mandela's African National Congress swept through the streets as
residents rushed to their front doors to wave, cheer and clap at
the passing throngs.
   Tens of thousands of people converged on the Jabulani Stadium
for an ANC rally celebrating Mandela's release and the lifting of a
government ban on the opposition group Feb. 2 by President F.W. de
Klerk.
   ``We are here not only to celebrate the unbanning of the ANC,
but to celebrate the release of Nelson,'' a speaker told the
cheering crowd.
   Many black youths left Soweto and other black townships to
celebrate in central Johannesburg. Happy people charged up and down
streets of the main business area, shouting ``Viva Mandela!''
   ``I'm very happy Mandela is free. You must also be happy,'' said
Simon Malofe, a young black mechanic.
   Another young black man, Jackson Mathebula, a cleaner, said, ``I
think things will be better now that he is free.''
   While a handful of whites took part in the celebrations in
Johannesburg, most white passers-by just watched.
   Wayne van Niekerk, a young security guard who said he was a
supporter of an extreme right-wing group, swore angrily when asked
for his opinion about the future: ``Mandela will probably be made
president, and then the world is just going to drop.''
   But a middle-aged white man, who refused to give his name, said:
``Let them give vent to their feelings; let them enjoy themselves,
as long as it's peaceful. It's good. We should do it as well.''

<HEAD>NATO Leader Outlines Proposal for Reunified Germany</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner says a
unified Germany could be part of the Western alliance without
extending NATO's military reach over what is now East Germany.
   Woerner, after spending the weekend at Camp David with President
Bush, said Sunday that a way will be found to keep Germany in NATO
while recognizing ``the legitimate security interests of the Soviet
Union.''
   Woerner, speaking with reporters at Andrews Air Force Base on
his way to Ottawa, outlined a possible solution that hews closely
to a proposal by West German Foreign Minister Hans
Dietrich-Genscher for keeping Germany in NATO but keeping Western
troops out of East German territory.
   ``We can and will find solutions which guarantee these security
interests of the Soviet Union,'' said Woerner.
   One possibility, he said, is ``not to extend the military
integration of NATO towards the former region of the German
Democratic Republic (now East Germany), and this could be done
without problems. But the whole of Germany could and should remain
a member of NATO.''
   Both Bush and Woerner hailed what the White House called West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's ``extraordinarily successful''
talks with Soviet leaders in Moscow.
   Kohl said Saturday he received ``unequivocal'' assurances from
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev that Moscow would respect the
right of the two Germanys to decide for themselves on the timing
and structure of their reunification.
   The White House said Bush and Woerner agreed that NATO ``should
adopt new political roles,'' including helping shape U.S. policies
toward the East Bloc nations now shifting toward democracy.
   Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, on NBC's ``Meet the
Press,'' said it was important that Germany ``remain tied in some
way to the Western community of nations,'' with arms control
arrangements to provide reassurance to the Soviets and other
countries.
   A neutral Germany ``would be a disaster for Europe ... because
the two world wars in this century were caused by Germany trying to
conduct a totally isolated national policy in the center of
Europe,'' Kissinger said.
   Gennadi Gerasimov, the Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, said,
``Our position is that it's for the Germans to decide what to do
next. If they want a reunited Germany, it's their decision.''
   But he added that any German union must take into account ``our
security concerns, and even our psychological concerns, because we
still have memories of that dreadful, terrible war we had with
Germany.''
   ``For many people in my country, it's difficult to understand
that we are going to have a big Germany again as our neighbor,''
said Gerasimov on ABC's ``This Week with David Brinkley.''
   John Herrick, an assistant White House spokesman, said Bush and
Woerner ``expressed their gratification that the government of the
Federal Republic of Germany had affirmed that a unified Germany
would remain a member of the North Atlantic Alliance.''
   ``They agreed that NATO, in addition to maintaining the common
defense, should adopt new political roles _ in helping guide
Western policy toward the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe,
in coordinating the negotiation and monitoring of arms control
agreements, and in developing Western policy for regional and
trans-national issues.''
   Kohl will be Bush's guest at Camp David on Feb. 24-25.

   The wild rejoicing over Nelson
Mandela's release from prison was tinged with violence and racial
confrontation that underline the problems South Africa faces in its
search for peace.
   In Johannesburg and other cities, the happy scenes of
celebration Sunday were interlaced with moments of ugly tension
between whites and blacks.
   Handfuls of blacks threatened whites and some whites hurled
bottles and insults at blacks celebrating the release of the
anti-apartheid leader after 27 years in prison for plotting against
the white minority government.
   The worst violence came in Cape Town: At least one person was
killed and scores wounded in fighting between police and rampaging
black youths who smashed shop windows and looted shortly before
Mandela addressed tens of thousands of fellow South Africans from
the steps of City Hall.
   Many whites looked worried or scared during the weekend as they
watched cheering and singing blacks surging through parts of
central Johannesburg. Elegantly dressed whites shrank back as the
black throngs danced around them.
   While most people, black and white, were well-behaved, a handful
of blacks taunted whites, yelling ``Freedom is coming! Whites get
out!''
   For some South Africans, the scattered incidents of racial
tension were worrying signs of what might happen when the
government and anti-apartheid groups attempt to negotiate.
   Leaders on both sides have expressed fears that white and black
extremists will provoke violence in the months ahead to try and
derail negotiations for their own ends. White extremists demand the
retention of white supremacy, while some black militants oppose a
compromise with whites.
   At the elegant Carlton shopping mall, three young black men
surrounded a young white couple, spitting on the frightened pair
and shaking fists at them. Other blacks intervened and chased the
taunters away.
   As blacks surged through Hillbrow, near the city center, some
whites in apartments overlooking the street hurled empty bottles at
the celebrants. The marchers screamed insults and shook their
fists, but no injuries were seen.
   Frightened white motorists caught in the milling masses in the
streets leaned on their horns or scattered the crowds by driving at
high speed. Some, however, clenched their fists in revolutionary
salutes.
   A white man watching the celebrants from his doorstep said,
``Look at them, look at them. What is happening to South Africa?''
   Some black youths pretended to fire imaginary machine guns at
police vans filled with white officers shadowing the celebrants.
Other blacks ran up to the vans, yelling ``Get out, get out!''
   But much larger groups of blacks shouted ``Peace, peace, peace.''
   Most blacks and whites spoke of the need to work out South
Africa's problems peacefully. ``I pray to God we have peace in
South Africa,'' said one black marcher. ``We must all live
together.''

   When Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., talks about
the clean air bill, he talks about the General Motors plant back
home in Oklahoma City and what tougher car pollution controls might
mean to its 20,000 workers.
   Why should Oklahoma motorists pay as much as $500 more for a car
to clean up the dirty air over Los Angeles or New York, he argues,
citing industry cost figures that some say are inflated.
   Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., isn't so worried about car
pollution measures as he is about the bill's proposed tough
controls on acid rain, which are expected to cost West Virginia
coal miners thousands of jobs.
   ``I've got to represent my people on this,'' says the senator,
who won a 100 percent approval rating from environmentalists last
year but will fight the clean air bill anyway.
   The Senate bill is the tougher version of two clean air bills in
Congress. The House measure more closely reflects a proposal sent
to Capitol Hill by the Bush administration last summer, and it has
been characterized as acceptable to industry, though not
necessarily welcomed with open arms.
   In an effort to resolve some senators' concerns _ which often
are regional in character and cross Republican and Democratic party
lines _ Senate leaders have held intense closed-door talks with the
White House for two weeks in hopes of working out a compromise.
   The bill's strongest advocates, including Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, D-Maine, argue that the Senate's tough measures
are needed to improve the nation's dirty air and safeguard the
health of tens of millions of citizens.
   ``I'm convinced that the public wants this protection,'' says
Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., adding that he believes citizens are
willing to pay a little more for cars and on their electric bills
if the result is cleaner air. Additional costs are balanced out by
reductions in health costs, he argues.
   But the views of Mitchell and Lieberman _ like those of many
senators on both sides of the issue _ also reflect their regional
interests.
   Mitchell's home state of Maine is on the receiving end of the
acid rain created by the release of millions of tons of sulfur
dioxide from Midwest electric power plants. Lieberman's Connecticut
shares the acid rain problem, but also has suffered increasingly
from severe urban smog, much of it generated outside the state or
from cars traveling through.
   Last week, Mitchell announced that Senate leaders had reached
tentative agreement on key parts of the legislation, including
compromises on curbing toxic chemical releases and smog-related
pollution from industry. In each case, the Democrats' bill was
weakened under White House pressure, Senate sources acknowledged.
   But the negotiators have not yet worked out agreements on acid
rain pollution and tougher pollution controls on automobiles _ the
biggest remaining issue. Several Senate sources suggest the auto
pollution issue may escape a solution and have to be fought out on
the Senate floor.
   One Senate participant in the talks characterized the White
House as adamant in its opposition to a second round of auto
pollution controls beginning in the year 2003 as required by the
Senate bill.
   The Bush administration has argued that the so-called ``second
tier'' automobile tailpipe controls in the Senate bill would cost
an extra $8 billion a year and similar benefits can be attained by
phasing in alternative fuel vehicles in cities with the worst
pollution.
   The administration agrees with most of the Senate bill's acid
rain proposal, but that provision faces strong regional opposition:
   _About 14 Midwest senators insist that the rest of the country
help pay to clean up the dirtiest electric power plants, which are
concentrated in the Midwest. While some compromise cost-sharing
programs have been floated, none has taken hold.
   _Senators from the West and New England as well as parts of the
South argue they've already paid for pollution controls that have
cleaned up their plants and don't want to pay for cleanup again.
   _Senators from states expecting growth in electricity demand
want provisions that will allow more expansion within pollution
control requirements.

   Immigration officials expect their plan to
hold up to 10,000 illegal aliens in tents will send a message to
discourage an expected surge of Central Americans seeking asylum.
   Nicaraguans, Salvadorans, Guatemalans and Hondurans apparently
forgot about the agency's last show of force a year ago along the
Mexican border, says Gene McNary, the new chief of the Immigration
and Naturalization Service.
   So tents and truckloads of beds and portable toilets are
arriving to make good on McNary's threat to detain up to 10,000
``border crashers'' at a remote detention camp here, northeast of
the border city of Brownsville.
   McNary, who last month released more than 1,000 people from the
same 347-acre compound to save money, now says he will spend as
much as necessary to show would-be intruders they can expect to be
detained and deported.
   ``It will be humane, but it won't be convenient,'' McNary said
in announcing the crackdown Wednesday. ``It will not be as though
you're staying at the Ritz-Carlton. You will lose your freedom
while you're here, and we don't want to do that.''
   At least $11 million will go toward the initial effort of
shifting Border Patrol agents and immigration examiners from other
parts of the country and packing detainees into large vinyl tents
with plywood floors.
   The first tent, to sleep up to 100 on gray metal bunk beds with
military green blankets, was ready for occupancy Friday at the Port
Isabel Service Processing Center, the minimum-security detention
camp's official title.
   Detainees call it ``El Corralon,'' the big corral, because of
the 12-foot-high double fencing topped with barbed wire.
   The bare expanse on a former naval air station sits in sharp
contrast to the nearby, lush Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife
Refuge with its tropical birds and endangered ocelots.
   INS officials said it probably would take at least 10 days
before the regular red-brick dormitories fill to their 1,600
capacity, making the tents necessary.
   The camp's population was 1,033 Friday, including 832 Central
Americans. Another 631 Central Americans were detained at five
other centers in the Lower Rio Grande Valley.
   The commissioner said steady increases in the number of Central
Americans apprehended by the Border Patrol prompted his blitz in
South Texas, the nearest U.S. point by land to Central America.
   ``Other-than-Mexican'' undocumented aliens _ mostly Central
Americans _ caught in Texas totaled 829 in October and shot up to
1,860 in January, according to the INS.
   Walner Hernandez, a 21-year-old Salvadoran detainee who came to
this country to find work and get away from the army as well as
anti-government guerrillas, said he thought word of the massive
detention policy would take hold in his country.
   ``I wrote my mother and told her don't recommend to nobody to
come illegally to the United States,'' Hernandez said.
   McNary's crackdown is an effort to prevent a repeat of late 1988
and early 1989, when more than 50,000 Central Americans streamed
across the border to apply for political asylum in south Texas.
   The INS had allowed asylum-seekers to travel to their families
in the United States. But officials in cities with large Central
American populations, such as Miami and Los Angeles, complained
they were overwhelmed, and the INS discovered that more than half
of those given travel papers never kept the obligation to report to
INS offices at their destinations.
   So the agency restricted travel for those with unresolved asylum
claims.
   Hundreds of homeless asylum-seekers began camping out in a
makeshift tent city and a condemned building in Brownsville.
   On Feb. 21, the agency announced that asylum applications would
be processed in one day at the detention camp. Those not able to
prove they were fleeing persecution, a requirement for political
asylum, immediately were detained and placed into deportation
proceedings.
   Since most were denied asylum under the speedy get-tough
process, asylum applications dropped from more than 500 a day to
fewer than 10.
   Now, with so many refugees still trying to get into the United
States, McNary decided to repeat the message to avoid a new crisis.
   Last time, he said, the INS waited too long to take action.
   Refugee advocates said people will come anyway to flee war.
   ``It's a life-or-death situation,'' said Jennifer Bailey, a
paralegal at a Central American legal-aid office in Harlingen.
``It's not a pleasure trip up north.''
   But officials in the Lower Rio Grande Valley as well as Miami
welcomed the renewed border effort.
   ``I think no better signal can be sent than that we are serious
about enforcing the laws along our border,'' said Cameron County
Judge Tony Garza in Brownsville.

   After 27 years of silence, Nelson
Mandela the man has replaced Nelson Mandela the myth.
   No longer the young lion of the anti-apartheid struggle, he is
now its weathered-faced elder statesman.
   But he still speaks with the authority and confidence that led
so many of his fellow blacks to invest their political hopes in his
leadership.
   ``I have fought against white domination. I have fought against
black domination,'' he told tens of thousands of supporters in
front of City Hall shortly after his release Sunday.
   ``I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society .
.. (and) it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die,'' he said.
   Millions of blacks got their first glimpse of Mandela on Sunday.
The government had prohibited visitors from photographing Mandela
since the 1960s, and only a handful of people knew what he looked
like.
   Mandela has clearly lost weight since he was jailed; both his
face and his body are leaner than when he was a sturdily built
boxer decades ago. His face is creased with two thick lines that
frame his strong, confident smile.
   His full head of hair is mostly gray, with a distinctive patch
of white on the right side. His voice is full and strong, and he
speaks like the lawyer he is, in slow, measured sentences.
   ``I ... place the remaining years of my life in your hands,''
Mandela told his supporters in central Cape Town after his release.
   Despite his age, Mandela's walk is smooth and graceful, and he
appears extremely fit, the result of a two-hour daily exercise
regimen that reportedly begins each morning at 3:30.
   In his first public appearance he was dignified, courteous and
polite. In a well-cut suit, he looked much more a politician than a
guerrilla leader.
   Nonetheless, his elderly appearance probably came as a surprise
to many South Africans, the majority of whom were born after
Mandela was last seen publicly in 1964.
   Pictures of him as a vigorous African National Congress leader
in his 40s have been widely circulated in recent years. Hundreds of
people at the rally wore T-shirts with that youthful face
emblazoned on the front.
   Mandela's reserved, even formal demeanor is likely to work in
his favor among whites, who have long been flooded with government
propoganda portraying him and the ANC as a communist-led terrorist
group.
   President F.W. de Klerk and his government now say Mandela is
committed to a peaceful resolution of the South African conflict,
and like the blacks, have invested considerable hope that Mandela
can succeed in bringing people together where others have failed.
   But Mandela stands firm on his commitment to a one-man, one-vote
democracy, a system the government rejects.

   President F.W. de Klerk, who set
Nelson Mandela free, remained out of public view on the black
leader's day of freedom and took time to ponder the political
forces he unleashed.
   Anton Pretorius, a spokesman for de Klerk, said the president
wasn't in his office Sunday and did not plan to comment on
Mandela's release until later in the week.
   ``I believe he's just trying to relax a bit today,'' Pretorius
said of the president, who has launched a series of dramatic
reforms since assuming power in August.
   He added that de Klerk was keeping abreast of developments and
probably watched the live coverage of Mandela's release on
government-run television.
   Mandela's freedom is seen as a key to bringing black leaders
into talks on a new constitution to give political rights to the
country's 28 million blacks. Virtually all black political leaders
rejected talks as long as Mandela remained imprisoned.
   De Klerk's decision to free Mandela has brought universal
applause from abroad. At home, the country's leading black
moderate, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, head of the Zulu tribe, has said he
is now prepared to enter talks.
   However, de Klerk may also find he has now played his best
political card.
   Some measures enforcing the apartheid system of racial
discrimination have been scrapped. Bans were lifted on opposition
groups in a historic speech by de Klerk on Feb. 2.
   However, the pillars of the apartheid system remain in place.
Opposition demands now focus on the issues where most whites are
most reluctant to make concessions: segregated schools and
neighborhoods and black voting rights.
   De Klerk also is facing a backlash from right-wing whites who
seek a return to strict apartheid measures.

   Rabbi Haskel Werzberger, an Auschwitz survivor,
died early today, four days after being shot in the head during a
robbery, authorities said. He was 58.
   Werzberger, a leader of the 25,000-member Hasidic Satmar sect,
died at Bellevue Hospital with his family present, said hospital
administrator Robert Frazier.
   The rabbi had been shot above the left eye early Thursday as he
sat in his car.
   After the shooting, the assailant dragged him out of the car,
dumped him in the street and drove away, police said.
   The car was found Friday, but no arrests have been made.
   Werzberger was the chief sexton and a senior assistant to Rabbi
Moses Teitelbaum, the Satmar's grand rebbe.

<TEXT>
   Here is a brief chronology of
South Africa's recent political history.
   1912 _ The South African Native National Congress, forerunner of
the African National Congress, is formed to fight for black
political rights.
   1948 _ The National Party government is elected and begins
codifying apartheid legislation.
   1955 _ A national People's Congress is broken up and 156 black
leaders, including Nelson Mandela, are charged with treason. All
are acquitted after a trial that lasts until 1961.
   March 21, 1960 _ The ANC and the Pan Africanist Congress call
for peaceful protests against laws requiring blacks to have passses
to enter white areas. Police shoot and kill 69 blacks at a rally in
the Sharpeville township south of Johannesburg.
   April 1960 _ Parliament outlaws the ANC and the PAC. Both
organizations launch guerrilla campaigns a year later.
   Aug. 5, 1962 _ Mandela is arrested and two years later is
sentenced to life in prison for sabotage and plotting to overthrow
the government.
   June 16, 1976 _ Thousands of black students demonstrate in the
Soweto township outside Johannesburg, protesting a requirement that
lessons be taught in the Afrikaans language. Police fatally shoot
several students, touching off nationwide riots and boycotts that
last more than a year and claim at least 575 black lives.
   Sept. 12, 1977 _ Steve Biko, founder of the Black Consciousness
movement, dies in police detention.
   Oct. 19, 1977 _ The government bans 18 organizations and the two
largest black newspapers. It also detains 47 black leaders.
   Aug. 20, 1983 _ The United Democratic Front is launched to
organize opposition to a planned three-house Parliament that still
excludes blacks. The front quickly becomes the largest legal
anti-apartheid group.
   September 1983 _ Riots break out in Sharpeville, touching off
three years of widespread violence claiming at least 2,500 black
lives.
   June 12, 1986 _ President P.W. Botha declares a nationwide state
of emergency, giving authorities broad powers to crack down on
opposition groups. More than 1,000 activists are detained in
pre-dawn raids. More than 30,000 people, almost all black, have
been held for varying lengths of time during the emergency.
   Feb. 24, 1988 _ The government effectively bans 17 opposition
groups, including the United Democratic Front.
   July 5, 1989 _ Botha invites the jailed Mandela to the
president's office for a conversation.
   Aug. 14, 1989 _ Botha resigns and is replaced by F.W. de Klerk.
   September 1989 _ De Klerk says he will allow peaceful
anti-government protest. Demonstrations in all major cities are
held without serious incident.
   Oct. 15, 1989 _ De Klerk frees six of Mandela's ANC colleagues
imprisoned for more than 25 years, including Walter Sisulu.
   Dec. 13, 1989 _ De Klerk meets Mandela at the president's office.
   Feb. 2 _ De Klerk legalizes the ANC and dozens of other banned
opposition groups and says Mandela soon will be freed
unconditionally.
   Saturday _ De Klerk announces that Mandela will be released
unconditionally the next day.
   Sunday _ Mandela leaves prison.

<HEAD>Fourth Straight Drought Year Looms</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Unless California gets rains of biblical
proportions in the next two months, a drought will enter its fourth
year, forcing one city to outlaw lawn-watering and others to
require serious water cutbacks.
   Los Angeles is drafting a water conservation incentive program,
farmers in Turlock are using well water to offset reservoir
shortages and merchants along shrunken Folsom Lake near Sacramento
are bracing for a decline in visitors.
   The state's precipitation stood at 60 percent of normal on Feb.
1 for the rainy season beginning Oct. 1, 1989. The 154 largest
reservoirs were at 74 percent capacity and the water content in the
snow pack was at 40 to 50 percent of normal, officials said.
   If California has even normal rainfall in February and March,
officials will declare the fourth consecutive drought year, said
Bob Fingado, senior engineer with the state Water Resources
Department.
   The most critical area is California's central coast, where
cities rely mainly on reservoirs for their water. The region's
reservoirs are at 20 percent normal capacity, and Gibraltar
Reservoir, which Santa Barbara uses for water, is dry.
   Santa Barbara, which has already banned hosing down driveways
and sidewalks and daytime watering, plans to take more severe steps
next month, including a ban on watering lawns and strict
restrictions on commercial water use.
   ``You're going to see a lot of brown lawns around here,'' said
Bill Ferguson, a Santa Barbara water conservation officer.
Officials intend to cut city-wide water consumption by 30 percent
to 45 percent.
   The Los Angeles area has largely escaped the drought's wrath
because the region uses a variety of water sources.
   Still, plans are being drafted to urge people to conserve water,
including a program that gives cash rebates to apartment owners who
install low-flow toilets, said Dorothy Jensen, a spokeswoman for
the city's Department of Water and Power.
   ``We are at the position where we are in short supply,'' she
said. ``We are having to buy a great deal of water. But we're not
to the point where we're going to call for mandatory conservation.''
   In Turlock, the drought has lowered the Don Pedro Reservoir to
the point that farmers will be pumping ground water to meet their
demands, said Russ DeLuca, irrigation system administrator with the
Turlock Irrigation District.
   Continued dry weather has diminished the possibility of a normal
runoff from the Sierra Nevada, and officials say precipitation in
the Tuolumne River water shed remains 4 inches below normal.
   The drought has hurt businesses around Folsom Lake east of
Sacramento, which last year lost an estimated 1 million visitors
from the previous year because of the low water level, state
officials said.
   Santa Clara County, which last year ordered mandatory 25 percent
water cutbacks for residents, may be forced to resume the program
if the water district can't recapture rain water in its now-empty
10 reservoirs.
   Teddy Morse, a spokeswoman for the Santa Clara Valley Water
District, also noted that voluntary conservation efforts in the
area south of San Francisco not working too well.
   In Nevada, the Sierra snow pack, which provides nearly all of
the Reno area's summer water, has a water content more than 50
percent below normal for early February.
   Last winter's snowfall was about average, but was not nearly
enough to replenish Lake Tahoe and other reservoirs drained the
previous two years.
   ``Not in historic time have we had four straight drought years
in Nevada,'' state climatologist John James said. ``This year,
water reserves are dangerously low. It's very difficult to make up
the difference.''

<HEAD>Nunn Says Bush Needs Arms Control Architects, Not `Carpenters'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee says the Bush administration's arms control position is
being put together by ``carpenters rather than architects'' and
lacks a broad view.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said Sunday that the administration needs
to look at U.S. weapons systems as they relate to arms control and
an apparent willingness by the Soviets to disarm.
   ``It's going to be awfully hard for this administration to say
we've had a breakthrough in negotiating with the Soviets, we're
going to reduce arms by about 30 to 40 percent and then come up and
say we want two missiles _ two of them mobile; we want a new B-2
bomber; we want an SDI program to go forward full steam _ all of
these things at one time,'' Nunn said on NBC-TV's ``Meet the
Press'' program.
   ``I don't think that's going to sell,'' he stated.
   Nunn said Bush's armed forces modernization plans do not take
into account some of the possibilities in arms control, such as
eliminating the MX rail mobile missile in exchange for the Soviet
SS-24, which also is a based on railroad cars, and moving toward a
policy of no multiple-warhead missiles.
   ``Our arms control position is really being done by carpenters
rather than architects,'' he said. ``I don't think in Congress
there's going to be a lot of receptivity to going forward with huge
weapon systems unless there is a strategic concept that fits into
the arms control.''

<HEAD>Mass Exodus Reported Under Way in Liberia As Army Moves Against</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials say more than 100,000 Liberians
have fled to neighboring countries in recent weeks to escape an
army campaign to stifle a Libyan-backed rebellion.
   Some official estimates say up to 140,000 have left the West
African country, with a majority going to Ivory Coast and the
remainder to Guinea.
   One U.S. official attributed the exodus to excesses by both
government forces and the rebels. But Andrew Natsios, director of
the U.S. Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, said the Army was
chiefly responsible.
   ``The behavior of the Army has been very disturbing,'' Natsios
said in an interview last week. ``It is primarily the Army that is
causing the movement of people.''
   He called the Army a ``major cause of human rights abuses.''
   One official, citing the testimony of refugees, said Army troops
are arresting all young men in the conflict area and some are being
shot.
   But another U.S. official said the flight of the Liberians was
based more on rumors of danger than on actual abuses.
   Both officials spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   The State Department said last month that U.S. military
officers, acting at the request of Liberian officials, had stepped
in to stop abuses by the government troops.
   Liberia, a nation of less than 2 million population, was founded
a century and half ago by freed American slaves.
   The United States and Liberia historically have had close ties
but the relationship over the past decade has been strained because
of repeated allegations of rights abuses and corruption by the
government of President Samuel K. Doe.

<HEAD>Bradley Raises More than $4 Million toward 1990 Senate Race</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley is deflecting
speculation about his presidential aspirations but has managed to
draw more than $4.1 million in the bank for his 1990 Senate race.
   Contributions of nearly $4.5 million flowed into the Bradley
account in 1989, including $3.9 million from individuals, $570,475
from political action committees and $17,500 from the Democratic
Party, Federal Election Commission records show.
   Dividends and interest on the money brought in nearly $200,000,
according to the Democrat's 1989 campaign finance report.
   Bradley has picked up $9.45 million in contributions, interest
and refunds since Jan. 1, 1985, including $8.9 million in
contributions alone. Among senators facing the voters this year, he
is second only to Sen. Phil Gramm, D-Texas, with $10.5 million in
receipts, according to an analysis by Common Cause.
   Campaign manager Nick Donatiello says he expects to raise at
least $2 million more to help buy expensive television advertising
time in the New York and Philadelphia markets.

<HEAD>Spacecraft Snaps More Venus Pictures After Glitch is Fixed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Galileo space ship cruised on the
next leg of its 2.4-billion mile, six-year trip to Jupiter after
engineers replaced faulty computer commands that made the craft act
like a mad shutterbug.
   Galileo snapped 16 planned photos of Venus on Saturday, but for
about five hours the shutter on the spacecraft's electronic camera
opened and closed 452 times when it wasn't supposed to do so. None
of those unintended exposures were recorded.
   NASA engineers sent the 2.8-ton Galileo new computer commands
late Saturday, and the camera was able to snap 38 pictures, right
on schedule, of cloud-shrouded Venus in a series that ended Sunday
morning.
   ``They seem to understand what happened, and they're not
concerned about any repeats,'' said Bob MacMillin, spokesman for
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Galileo is now flying back toward Earth so the planet can act as
a gravity slingshot on Dec. 8 to help the spacecraft reach Jupiter
in 1995 in a $1.35 billion mission to explore the solar system's
largest planet.
   Galileo swooped about 10,000 miles above the 900-degree
Fahrenheit surface of Venus at 9:59 p.m. PST Friday in the
mission's first ``gravity assist maneuver.'' Venus helped increase
Galileo's speed by almost 5,000 mph, giving it enough energy to get
to Jupiter.
   After the flyby, the spacecraft took 16 pictures to study
Venusian cloud and wind patterns and look for lightning. The camera
bugs then developed.
   MacMillin said engineers determined Galileo's camera and
computer were fine, and that the problem was in a computer program
sent from Earth to tell Galileo what to do and when to do it.
   The problem was caused by improper timing between various
commands within the computer program, MacMillin said.
   He said such problems are not unusual on a spacecraft as new as
Galileo. The craft was deployed Oct. 18 from the cargo bay of space
shuttle Atlantis, then launched by a solid-fueled booster to start
its looping 2.4-billion-mile, six-year trip to Jupiter.
   The spacecraft was programmed to continue looking back at Venus
until late this Friday, taking 27 more photos and using other
sensors to detect dust, infrared and visible light, and
electrically charged particles.
   The pictures and measurements are stored on the spacecraft's
tape recorder. Almost all of them will be sent back to Earth in
October when Galileo is close enough to send scientific information
using its small antenna.
   That antenna now can be used only to help run the spacecraft. A
large antenna currently is furled to protect it from the sun's heat.
   After swinging past Earth in December, Galileo will explore
asteroid Gaspra in October 1991, then make another flight past
Earth on Dec. 8, 1992. The spacecraft may study asteroid Ida in
August 1993 before Galileo deploys a 760-pound probe in July 1995.
Galileo and the probe will reach Jupiter in December 1995.
   The probe will parachute into the planet's atmosphere, relaying
measurements to Galileo until it is vaporized by intense heat and
pressure. Galileo will swoop past the moon Io and its
sulfur-spewing volcanoes, then go into orbit around Jupiter to
study the planet and moons Europa, Callisto and Ganymede at least
until late 1997.

<HEAD>Plans Being Made for Berlin as Capital of United Germany</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forty-five years after Soviet troops dealt a
fatal blow to the Third Reich in the streets of this city, Germans
are drawing up plans for bringing the capital of a united Germany
back to Berlin.
   West Germans on Sunday were caught up in reunification euphoria
after an elated Chancellor Helmut Kohl returned from Moscow with
what he called ``a green light for the unity of our fatherland.''
   Dismissed as a nostalgic dream just four months ago, German
unification has become increasingly likely. Kohl says the historic
step could come by the end of this year.
   Kohl led a champagne toast ``to Germany'' on board his crowded
jetliner heading back to Bonn after talks in Moscow with Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   The West German leader made it clear that the World War II
Allies _ France, Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union _
will have a key role in shaping unification plans along with the
two German states.
   Still, West Germany faces numerous financial and other
challenges as it attempts to unite its renowned wealth with the
nearly collapsed economy of East Germany, where the collapse of
Communist rule has virtually crippled the government.
   ``The Federal Republic (West Germany) is facing an economic
adventure,'' commented the ZDF television network. ``No one can
predict just how much the joining will cost. But it's certain that
in the areas of unemployment benefits, pensions and medical costs,
West Germans will be asked to make sacrifices in the billions.''
   The increasingly rapid turn of events has focused attention on
Berlin, which many regard as the true German capital. East Berlin
is the capital of East Germany, although the Western Allies insist
that violates post-war agreements. Bonn is the capital of West
Germany.
   After weeks of being skeptical about unification, West Berlin's
leftist-led city government said Sunday it will begin working with
East Berlin officials to prepare the entire city to become the
capital of a united Germany.
   West Berlin planning chief Michaela Schreyer announced that
``several models will be developed for the increasingly probable
case'' of making the city the capital.
   She said buildings must be sought for use by embassies,
government agencies and delegations from German states. The stately
Reichstag building near the Brandenburg Gate is expected to serve
as the Parliament building.
   Planners in both the East and West have their work cut out for
them.
   With a total of about 3 million residents on both sides of the
city, Berlin already is overcrowded and heavy smog drifts over the
city from surrounding East Germany.
   Housing in the West is extremely scarce, and the situation will
only get worse if tens of thousands people including lawmakers,
support staff, diplomats, lobbyists and national organizations
arrive in search of places to live.
   The only possibilities for suburban expansion are in surrounding
East Germany, but builders would have to start from scratch there
in constructing new homes and apartments. Berlin is located 100
miles inside East Germany.
   The World War II allies still have control over Berlin, once the
Nazi capital and later the site of the Cold War showdown that led
to the Berlin Wall.
   Ms. Schreyer promised to work with the Allies in preparing for
the return of the capital.
   ``After the fall of the Berlin Wall, it is now necessary to
overcome the walls in our heads and to start to plan for Berlin as
a whole,'' Ms. Schreyer said in a statement to the news media.
   Sports officials are already pressing to make Berlin the site of
a future Olympic Games.
   Suggestions abound to hold international meetings and
conferences in the city to symbolize the improvements in East-West
relations.
   The growing focus on Berlin has led to mounting concerns in
Bonn, which was a sleepy Rhine River city before it was turned into
West Germany's ``provisional'' capital 41 years ago with the defeat
of the Nazis.
   Hildegard-Hamm Bruecher, a leading member of the Free Democrats
party, has demanded an immediate halt to government building
projects in Bonn.
   ``Further construction in what is still the capital cannot be
justified given the rapid pace of change in German-German
relations,'' she told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper.

   World War II veteran and Purple
Heart winner Anthony Beggetta died expecting to be buried with
military pomp.
   But when his family tried to arrange the color guard, rifle
salute and bugle-blown ``Taps,'' they discovered a change in policy
at New England's main army base because of budget constraints.
   ``My father didn't talk too much about it, but he said he wanted
a military funeral,'' said Beggetta's daughter, Jeanne Udas. ``It's
just something we knew all our lives that he wanted.''
   Beggetta, who was 75 when he died Jan. 19, got his military
sendoff when officials at the local Veterans of Foreign Wars Post
sent a color guard.
   But although the family appreciated the efforts, the funeral
``wasn't of course as impressive as what my father expected or
wanted,'' Udas said.
   The problem, military officials say, is that the veteran
population from World War II is aging at a time when the military
is under pressure to trim spending.
   ``There's no intent to slight veterans. That's not the point.
When there's less money, we have to find ways to cut,'' said
Phillip Morris, spokesman for Fort Devens in Ayers.
   Army policy is to provide funeral details for soldiers who die
on active duty and Medal of Honor winners, said Shari Lawrence,
spokeswoman for the Army's Personnel Command in Alexandria, Va. Any
veteran is entitled to the presence of a service representative of
equal rank, who usually presents the family with a U.S. flag, she
said.
   Beyond that, policy is up to individual commanders and Lawrence
said there was no centralized information on how funerals are
handled. Still, she said she was not aware of problems nationally.
   Fort Devens sends out funeral details for 20-year retirees and
former prisoners of war, Morris said. In the Begetta's case, a
sergeant was sent to present the flag to the family.
   Previously, the base had responded to most requests within 300
miles with 15-man details, including pallbearers, a bugle player
and a rifle group. In 1988, 3,345 soldiers were assigned to details
at 229 funerals. Smaller groups, using 768 soldiers were sent to 96
funerals, he said.
   ``We were sending them all over the six-state New England area,
lots of them. It was a drain,'' he said.
   During the first six months of 1989, 118 full details and 77
smaller contingents went out. After the policy change, the number
dwindled to only 26 full funerals and 18 smaller details.
   How the base came to be in the position of sending out so many
details is difficult to tell, Morris said.
   ``I think it just kind of progressed and progressed and finally
got to the point where we were just doing all those funerals,'' he
said.
   Bill Smith, director of public affairs for the Washington, D.C.,
headquarters of the VFW, said the problem could be that the World
War II veterans are growing older, with an average age of 67.
   He said he understands that some families would prefer the
attention of a military base.
   ``We are a substitute,'' he said.
   Morris said he does not know how much the base is saving through
cutting the funeral details because it involves too many variables.
At one point, Fort Devens was on a list of bases under
consideration for closure, but it has since acquired the
Information System Command.
   ``I think it's pretty obvious that we were expending lots of
troop labor to support veterans funerals all over New England,''
Morris said. ``It was one of many things that we've cut back. The
times are getting leaner and we have to do more with less.''

   Fans showered Sammy Davis Jr. with cards and
letters as the entertainer battled a recurrence of throat cancer.
   ``The hospital has been inundated with cards from friends and
fans all over the world,'' said his spokeswoman, Susan Reynolds.
   Davis, who was diagnosed with throat cancer in September, was
being treated at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. The condition of the
64-year-old Davis was not revealed.
   ``He remains hospitalized and he's undergoing treatment,''
Reynolds said Sunday. ``He's being treated appropriately.''
   Davis, a versatile singer-dancer whose career has stretched from
poverty to the Las Vegas stage and motion pictures, most recently
appeared in the 1989 movie ``Tap,'' playing an old-time tap dancer
named Little Mo.
   During a tribute to Davis televised earlier this month, he

<HEAD>State-Run TV Gives Extensive Coverage To Mandela Release</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-South Africa, Bjt
^By BARRY RENFREW</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South African television today
kept up its extensive coverage of Nelson Mandela's release and also
carried detailed reports on world reaction to the event.
   Early morning television on state-run South African Broadcasting
Corp. continued to broadcast footage of Mandela's stroll to freedom
on Sunday along with clips of the black leader's speech, in which
he endorsed the armed struggle against the white-minority
government.
   SABC also carried lengthy reports from Washington, London and
other major capitals on how foreign governments were responding.
   South African newspapers showered the release with massive
coverage. Several in Johannesburg and other cities put out special
editions with headlines like, ``Mandela Walks Free.''
   The extensive coverage by state television of a man once
regarded as an enemy by many white South Africans would have been
unthinkable a year or two ago. Mandela's release was given
unprecedented coverage by local standards.
   Prior to Feb. 2, when President F.W. de Klerk lifted a 30-year
ban on the African National Congress, the speech would have been
illegal and the SABC could have been prosecuted for broadcasting it.
   SABC usually only provides live coverage of news events that are
announced well in advance and carefully planned, such as a
presidential speech. The SABC scrapped much of its afternoon
programming Sunday to show Mandela's walk to freedom, even though
the event occured 75 minutes behind schedule.
   The long wait was clearly a challenge to SABC reporters not used
to doing live coverage. The commentator at one point extolled on
the virtures of Victor Verster prison as being probably the world's
most beautiful jail.
   SABC reporter Clarence Keyter became caught up in the excitement
of the moment, repeatedly telling viewers they were about to watch
history in the making.
   ``This is the moment the world has been waiting for,'' Keyter
said. ``The sun is shining on South Africa.''
   The coverage stopped when Mandela's motorcade pulled away from
Victor Verster prison en route to Cape Town, and there was no live
coverage of later violence in the city or of Mandela's speech at
City Hall.
   But this morning's news show and the Sunday night main news
devoted almost all their coverage to the release, showing footage
of black youths looting shops and broadcasting portions of
Mandela's speech.

   An 8-year-old girl was shot in the back
by a stray bullet while riding on a Disneyland train with her
parents, police said. She and was in guarded condition today after
undergoing surgery.
   Nayeli Diana Placentia, of Downey, was aboard the open air
attraction Sunday evening when she felt a sharp pain, said police
Sgt. Thomas Lahmon.
   Detectives believe the child was struck by a stray bullet fired
somewhere off Disneyland property.
   The train has no sides and has a canvas top, Lahmon said. It was
not immediately known whether any arrests were made or whether
there was gang activity in the area during the shooting, Lahmon
added.
   The girl underwent surgery at University of California, Irvine
Medical Center and was under observation at the pediatric intensive
care unit, said hospital spokeswoman Elaine Beno.

   Investigators say it's too early to tell what
caused a sightseeing helicopter to crash into the East River, but
the pilot says he believes a gust of wind might be to blame.
   A 14-year-old boy who was trapped inside the submerged wreckage
for up to 20 minutes remained in critical condition early today at
Bellevue Hospital, where he was unconscious and on a respirator, a
hospital official said.
   The four others aboard the helicopter, including the boy's
father, were not seriously injured.
   Frank Ghiorsi, regional director of the National Transportation
Safety Board, said Sunday it would take time to determine what
caused the Bell Jet Ranger 206-L to go down Saturday.
   ``The pilot believes he got caught by a gust from the tail,
tailwind,'' Ghiorsi said. ``He said he believed the right skid
caught the water. He said he heard a bang but he doesn't know
whether it was before or after the impact.''
   The helicopter had been pulled from the water and would be
studied by investigators, Ghiorsi said.
   ``We haven't ruled out the possibility that there was some type
of mechanical problem,'' he said. ``We'll look at the human factor,
the environment and the aircraft and try to put the pieces
together.''

   Billionaire Donald Trump and his wife, Ivana,
who amassed a fortune with their names written all over it, decided
to call it quits on their 12-year marriage.
   ``Ivana is a wonderful woman and a very good woman and I like
her. We might even get back together. I can't say we won't. Who
knows what could happen?'' Trump said, according to today's Daily
News.
   Trump is giving his wife about $20 million and a 45-room country
home in Greenwich, Conn., according to a statement issued Sunday on
behalf of the flamboyant tycoon.
   Trump, 43, told his wife Tuesday before he left for Tokyo that
the marriage ``just wasn't working out,'' said the statement.
   The Daily News reported Sunday that the 43-year-old Mrs. Trump
was devastated because her husband was betraying her, but Trump
denied that.
   ``And as for those other women I have been linked with, well, I
want to say that we are all just friends and that's as far as it
goes,'' he said.
   The statement did address custody arrangements regarding the
couple's three children.
   Forbes magazine says Trump is worth around $1.7 billion, ranking
him 19th on its 1989 list of America's 400 richest people.
   Mrs. Trump, a socialite and former model from Czechoslovakia,
used to manage the Trump Castle casino in Atlantic City, N.J., and
has been in charge of renovations at the Plaza Hotel in New York
City.

   Snow fell in Montana early today and much of the Northwest
braced for an invasion of arctic air. Rain dampened eastern
Pennsylvania.
   Highs in Montana on Sunday ranged from the 40s to the low 60s,
but the balmy conditions ended early today with temperatures
dropping to the teens and 20s.
   A winter storm warning was in effect for the Cascade and Olympic
mountains of Washington state, where up to 2 feet of snow were
expected. Temperatures were expected to plunge from the weekend
high of 50 degrees to the teens today.
   In Oregon, a snow advisory was issued for the northern Cascades
today, and winter storm watches have been posted for tonight for
the Williamette Valley and the northern and central coastal
mountains of Oregon.
   On Sunday afternoon, gusts up to 60 mph in north-central Montana
blew up a dust storm that forced the temporary closure of U.S. 87
between Great Falls and Fort Benton.
   ``It's zero visibility and it's hard to breathe,'' Highway
Patrol Officer Larry Johnson said of conditions north of Great
Falls.
   Elsewhere Sunday, showers and thunderstorms lingered over
extreme southern Florida, and scattered showers brought light rain
and snow to parts of the Ohio Valley and the middle Atlantic Coast
region.
   Dry weather prevailed across the rest of the nation, with fair
skies over much of the Southeast.
   Freezing temperatures were primarily confined to parts of North
Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan.
   Temperatures warmed into the 50s in the Pacific Northwest, and
soared into the 70s and lower 80s in Southern California, southern
Arizona, Florida and the south-central part of the nation.
   The high for the nation Sunday was 86 degrees at Miami.

<HEAD>Bush Declines Invitation to Address International AIDS Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some organizers of the Sixth International
Conference on AIDS said they weren't surprised when President Bush
turned down an invitation to speak to the group.
   Bush, who declined to address the June conference either live or
on videotape, was booed at the 1987 AIDS conference in Washington,
D.C., when he was vice-president.
   The president's decision marks the first time in three years
that the leader of the meeting's host nation has not addressed the
assembly.
   White House Deputy Press Secretary Alixe Glen said Bush has
addressed the AIDS issue and ``the need for compassion many times.''
   ``We're disappointed,'' said Dr. John L. Ziegler, conference
co-chairman and a professor of medicine at the University of
California, San Francisco. ``We felt this was a real opportunity
for the government to make a strong statement.''
   But Stephen Morin, a member of the conference's community task
force and an aide to Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., wasn't surprised.
   ``I think the president has good reason for not coming,'' he
said. ``Neither the people of San Francisco nor the scientific
community think much of his AIDS policies.''
   Bush was discussing Reagan administration plans for mandatory
AIDS testing of immigrants and prison inmates when he was jeered in
1987.
   U.S. policies restricting the freedom of foreigners infected
with the AIDS virus to enter the country have been criticized.
Although restrictions were eased last month, anyone infected still
has to reveal their condition when applying for a visa and request
a waiver of rules barring them from the United States.
   At least 16 groups, including the International League of Red
Cross and Red Crescent Societies, have said they will boycott the
conference of 12,000 scientists and policy-makers unless the U.S.
entrance restrictions are ended.
   Other national leaders who have spoken to the international AIDS
convention include Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney last
year, and Sweden's Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson in 1988.
   Although Bush declined to address the gathering, Glen said the
president does plan to talk to the National Business Leadership
Conference on AIDS next month in Arlington, Va.

<TEXT>
   Socialist candidate Hideko Ito, in her
bright red signature clothes, cuts a bold streak across the vast
snowfields of northern Japan.
   Running for the powerful lower house of Parliament, Ms. Ito is
blazing a new political trail with a mixture of fresh ideas and
traditional values, hoping to attract votes away from the
scandal-wracked, male-dominated Liberal Democratic Party, which has
governed Japan for 34 years.
   ``I want to change the many years of money politics created by
Liberal Democratic control,'' she declares from atop her campaign
van. ``They have not created a government that serves ordinary
people like you and me.''
   ``Hideko Ito _ mother and lawyer. She'll do her best,'' is the
repetitive refrain blared from Ms. Ito's van as it barrels through
the icy streets of Sapporo, a city of 1.6 million on Hokkaido,
Japan's northernmost main island.
   With the ruling party at a turning point _ damaged by almost two
years of scandals and unpopular tax and farm policies _ voters have
a difficult choice: politics as usual or the uncertainty of a
multiparty coalition led by the Socialists, the largest opposition
group.
   Ousting the pro-business, conservative Liberal Democrats could
signal more difficult trade relations with the United States.
Political uncertainty has already bred instability in stock and
currency markets in Japan and elsewhere in the world.
   The Socialist Party, seeking wider appeal, watered down its
longstanding opposition to the Japan-U.S. security treaty, under
which U.S. troops are based in Japan. But it is clear that a
leftist-led coalition government would mean a reordering of Tokyo's
relations with Washington.
   About 90 million people are eligible to vote in Sunday's
election.
   Most analysts predict the Liberal Democrats will retain a simple
majority of 257 seats in the 512-seat lower house. But a big drop
from their current 295 seats could create a significant realignment
of power.
   Polls show many voters are undecided, making the last week of
campaigning even more crucial.
   The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the leading economic daily, reported
Friday that a telephone poll of 10,000 people showed 32.4 percent
were undecided, while 34.1 percent said they would vote for the
Liberal Democrats, 20.9 percent for the Socialists and the
remainder for other parties. No margin of error was given.
   Now that the Recruit Co. influence-peddling scandal and the sex
scandal that helped drive two prime ministers from office last year
are out of the spotlight, public anger has subsided, political
analysts say. But two Liberal Democrats who are on trial for
bribery for their roles in the Recruit affair are seeking
re-election, reviving memories of the scandal.
   The Liberal Democrats are attempting to cleanse the stain of
scandal with pledges of honest politics, and to dilute the
Socialists' popularity with declarations that a more leftist
government would be bad for Japan.
   The Socialists' main theme is to abolish a 3 percent sales tax
the Liberal Democrats rammed through Parliament. The Liberal
Democrats also have been hurt by making trade concessions to the
United States on agricultural imports. The Socialists promise a
more protectionist farm trade policy.
   One of Ms. Ito's Liberal Democratic opponents, incumbent Shizuo
Sato, 48, is just as active as she is, popping up at countless
Lunar New Year festivities in Sapporo and visiting the city's Snow
Festival, a weeklong show of ice sculptures that draws more than 1
million visitors from throughout the world.
   ``Now is the time for honest and courageous politics,'' Sato's
campaign motto says.
   ``Many people are against the (sales) tax and many distrust my
party,'' the Liberal Democrat tells about 40 workers at a small
construction company. ``I understand their distrust, but if the
party loses its majority it will be a disaster.''
   Sato appears to be in danger of losing his seat, one of three
held by the Liberal Democrats in the Sapporo constituency. Despite
a well-cultivated image as an internationalist _ his campaign
brochures feature pictures of him with Henry Kissinger and
President Bush _ he is suffering from his party's image among the
relatively progressive voters in Japan's fastest-growing city.
   Ms. Ito is expected to be a top vote-getter, though she is a
first-time candidate with no experience in government.
   She is riding a wave of blossoming support for female candidates
_ dubbed ``Madonnas'' because of the departure they represent from
postwar politics, an all-male enclave of pork-barreling and
backroom deals.
   In a profile of Ms. Ito on national television, the 46-year-old
lawyer was heralded for studying for law exams while nursing one of
her three children. She was dubbed the ``red Madonna of the
snow-white cities of Hokkaido.''
   ``I think women in politics is a good thing,'' says Keiko Sato,
a woman working in a convenience store. ``It's important to have
the views of women in politics.''
   The Liberal Democrats will suffer if that view is widespread,
since the conservative party has no women representatives in the
lower house and is backing no female candidates. The Socialists,
led by Takako Doi, the first female party head ever in Japan, are
backing eight women.
   Nationwide, only 66 of the 953 candidates are women.
   Last July, women voters and candidates made a strong impact in
the election for the less-powerful upper house of Parliament,
costing the Liberal Democrats their majority in that chamber.

lawsuits when he took Trans World Airlines to task over its manners.
   Justice Richard Neely, 48, filed the lawsuit in Kanawha County
Circuit Court after a July flight from Seattle to New York during
which TWA allegedly handled a luggage delay poorly.
   According to the lawsuit, Neely was shoved by a female employee
while he was acting as an informal liaison for his approximately
150 fellow passengers who were waiting for their luggage.
   It was the first lawsuit filed by Neely since he was elected to
the high court in 1973.
   ``It's good to get back in the courts as an attorney every now
and then,'' said Neely, who had a private practice before the
election.
   He said he wrote an article for the American Bar Association's
magazine ``Litigation'' detailing the methods he used in his suit.
He said the article would be published soon.
   Phone calls to Don Morrison, TWA's director of public relations
in St. Louis, weren't answered Sunday night.
   Neely said he has no specific plans for the money.
   ``Am I going to go out and and spend it on fast horses, women
and whiskey? At my age, no,'' he said.

   The dollar was mixed in early European trading
today. Gold prices fell.
   Foreign currency dealers said trading was calm as investors
tried to assess the impact of a possible monetary union between
West and East Germany on the Deutsche mark.
   They said that with the Japanese markets closed for a national
holiday, European traders started out with few clues and were
waiting for U.S. markets to set the trend.
   The prospect of a Germany monetary union, which rocked the
German bond market last week, has so far had little impact on the
currency market.
   Dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Friday:
   _1.6677 West German marks, down from 1.6750
   _1.4945 Swiss francs, up from 1.4935
   _5.6830 French francs, up from 5.6765
   _1.8003 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8835
   _1,243.50 Italian lire, up from 1,242.25
   _1.2030 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1987
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound, and was
quoted at $1.6980, compared with $1.6930 late Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $415.75 a troy ounce,
unchanged from late Friday. At midmorning, the city's major bullion
dealers fixed a recommended price of $415.25.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $414.75, down from $416.00 bid late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 92 cents to close at a bid
$414.41.
   Silver rose in London to a bid price of $5.27 a troy ounce, from
Friday's $5.25.

   Two ``coldblooded'' suspects in
shootings that killed a man and three girls and wounded three other
people during a bowling alley robbery have slipped past roadblocks,
police said.
   Saturday's killings, along with an unrelated slaying the same
day, brought the number of homicide victims in this city of 55,000
people to six this year _ triple the number for all of last year.
   ``It's not the city it was when I used to roam the streets,''
said police Capt. Fred Rubio.
   Police said Sunday they have had to rely on rough sketches, the
survivors and tips from the public for leads into the bowling alley
shootings.
   Police said two men walked into the Las Cruces Bowl early
Saturday and herded seven people into an office in the front of the
building, forced them to lie on the floor and shot them in the back
of their heads.
   The men then set fire to the office in an effort to cover up the
crime, police said.
   The shootings killed a 26-year-old man, his stepdaughter, his
daughter and another young girl. Three others were critically
wounded.
   Teams of officers were checking out about 100 pieces of
information telephoned to Las Cruces police from other law
enforcement agencies and the public. But no arrests had been made,
police said.
   ``These people are just coldblooded people,'' Rubio said.
   He said police planned to give authorities in Mexico copies of
composite drawings of the suspects. Las Cruces is 45 miles from the
border.
   But police also are checking a report that the men are from the
Las Cruces area, Rubio said.
   Killed were bowling alley employee Steve Teran, 26, daughter
Valerie, 2, stepdaughter Paula Holguin, 6, and Amy Houser, 13.
   Police withheld the names of the wounded, but Rubio said they
were two adults and a 12-year-old child. Two of the wounded were in
serious condition and the third was in good condition, a spokesman
at Memorial General Hospital said.
   ``They've got to be maniacs to do this,'' Audrey Teran said of
the men who killed her husband and children. ``What can a
2-year-old do? What threat are they to them? ... My little girls,
my babies. This whole thing is senseless.''
   Police Lt. Jerry Fariss said he had spoken with two of the
surviving victims.
   ``One of them was able to give a description that tends to match
the one we've got,'' Fariss said.
   The bowling alley, which also has a restaurant and bar, is in a
mixed commercial and residential area.
   Rubio said there were two homicides in Las Cruces in all of 1989
and six so far this year.
   The fifth homicide of the year, a stabbing, occurred Saturday
afternoon. Police arrested James Hayes Lane, 30, of Abilene, Texas,
who had recently been paroled from the Texas Department of
Corrections after serving time for attempted murder and car theft.

<HEAD>58 Killed In Burmese Battles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burmese government forces overran the
headquarters of an ethnic rebel group over the weekend in battles
on the border that claimed the lives of at least 58 combatants,
Thai and rebel officials said today.
   The officials said the fighting sent thousands of civilians
fleeing into Thailand.
   A bomb blast killed 33 ethnic Karen guerrillas Saturday at their
stronghold of Kaw Moo Ra on Thai territory, a spokesman for the
group said. The spokesman said he believed the blast came from a
booby trap in captured war munitions.
   Thai border police said they found the bodies of 19 Burmese and
six Karen fighters Sunday at the Thai village of Ban Waeng Kaew. It
is directly across opposite Kaw Moo Ra, about 250 miles north of
Bangkok.
   About 200 Burmese troops crossed into Thailand on Friday to
attack the base, one of the last held by the Karen on the frontier.
   Further south on Sunday, about 1,000 Burmese troops overran the
headquarters of the New Mon State Army near the Burmese border
village of Three Pagoda Pass, a Thai official said. They had seized
and burned the town two days earlier.
   Kavee Minwong, district chief of the Thai town of Sangkha just
opposite the battle zone, said Burmese troops began their attack
about midnight Saturday and captured the base early the next day.
   Both sides appeared to have suffered heavy casualties, but
neither was willing to reveal the extent of their losses, he said.
   About 4,000 ethnic Mon civilians fled into Thailand to escape
the fighting and marauding Burmese troops, Kavee said. About 200
Thai civilians were evacuated to safety, he said.
   The official said the Mon refugees would be sent back across the
border once the fighting died down.
   The Karen spokesman said the bomb blast at Kaw Moo Ra occurred
while guerrillas were carrying captured weapons and munitions back
to the camp.
   He said it was one of the worst Karen death tolls in years of
fighting, and he suspected the munitions had been booby-trapped by
the government troops.
   The Karen and the Mon are among the diverse ethnic groups that
have fought for decades against central control by Rangoon.
   Both have relied on controlling smuggling routes between
Thailand and Burma to finance their rebellions.
   However, the military government of Burma launched a sustained
offensive in October 1988 that has badly hurt the Karen.

<HEAD>Six Dead, Dozens Wounded in Salvador Air Raid During Fighting</HEAD>

   Government aircraft bombed and
strafed suspected rebel positions during fighting around a
northeastern village, killing at least six people and wounding 20,
witnesses said.
   Also Sunday, a U.S. congressional delegation arrived in the
country to investigate the November killing of six Jesuits, their
housekeeper and her daughter. The director of El Salvador's
military college and eight other soldiers were charged last month
with the murders.
   Sunday's raid came during fighting that broke out early Sunday
between government and leftist rebel forces in the village of
Corral de Piedra, 53 miles northeast of the capital, said a female
church worker. She did not want to be identified for fear of
reprisals.
   ``The planes and helicopters did their work for about two
hours,'' she said. ``We were in chapel when we heard the shooting
in the hills, and we heard about 10 bombs explode, shaking the
chapel, and the dust then sifted in under the doors.''
   There was no comment from the government about the attack.
   A resettlement camp for refugees in the decade-old civil war in
Corral de Piedra appeared to be one of the targets, the witness
said by telephone.
   ``When people finally dared to go out, we went into a house and
we saw five children and one adult dead. The roof of the house was
blown up by a bomb. At the same spot I saw about 20 wounded
people,'' she added.
   The witness said she was able to get a car and evacuate five of
the wounded.
   A nurse at the Chalatenango Regional Hospital said that the
wounded were being evacuated there from Corral de Piedra.
   ``There are more than 10 wounded here. We have a lot of work.
Another three (wounded) were taken to San Salvador, and it is known
there are many dead there (in the village),'' the nurse said. She
too spoke on condition of anonymity.
   About 300 refugees were living at the Corral de Piedra
resettlement camp, which was set up when they arrived in October
from the Mesa Grande refugee camp in neighboring Honduras. They had
spent eight years in the Honduran camp.
   Senior military officers have been publicly saying in recent
weeks that the people at the Corral de Piedra camp were secretly
collaborating with the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, a
coalition of five guerrilla organizations fighting to topple the
rightist government.
   Human rights groups estimate more than 75,000 people have been
killed since the rebel war began in October 1979, most of them
civilians.
   The 14-member congressional delegation, led by Rep. Joe Moakley,
D-Mass., arrived at a military airport and did not talk with
reporters.
   Its members were to begin meeting today with government,
military, church, union and human rights officials as part of its
investigation.
   The Jesuit massacre has provoked criticism of U.S. support for
the Salvadoran government.

<HEAD>Kremlin Offers to Negotiate Troop Withdrawal in Poland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN IAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Kremlin says it is ready to negotiate the
withdrawal of its troops from Poland as part of an overall cutback
in the East bloc _ and is ready to begin the reductions without
waiting for a superpower treaty.
   ``It is of importance not to miss the historic chance and to
supplement political detente by a relaxing of tension in the
military field in good time,'' the government said in a statement
carried Sunday by the official Tass news agency.
   The statement declared the Cold War over and said it was time to
begin ``the gradual dismantling of the outdated model of the
European balance of forces.''
   Superpower talks on cutting conventional armies in Europe have
accelerated as Communist regimes have collapsed in East bloc
countries and the governments that replaced them demanded that the
Soviet troops go home.
   Soviet troops put down nationalist uprisings in Hungary in 1956
and Czechoslovakia in 1968.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Bush have agreed in
principle on major troops cuts in Europe, and the Soviet Union has
been negotiating with Czechoslovakia and Hungary on the withdrawal
of troops.
   ``If the government of the Republic of Poland expresses an
appropriate desire, we could discuss with its representatives the
question of Soviet troops in that country,'' the Kremlin said.
   Of the 575,000 Soviet troops in Eastern Europe, about 40,000 are
in Poland.
   Gorbachev has agreed with Bush's proposal to set a ceiling of
225,000 troops for each superpower in Europe, with 195,000 of them
allowed in Central Europe.
   Following the visit of Secretary of State James A. Baker III to
Moscow last week, Gorbachev suggested the limit of 195,000 be
extended to Europe as a whole.
   The Kremlin statement Sunday said the Soviet Union was prepared
to begin cutting troop strengths in the East bloc without waiting
for an official treaty to be signed at the Vienna conference on
conventional forces in Europe.
   ``There are misgivings that the results of the Vienna talks may
lag behind the pace of reforms in Europe,'' the statement said.
   As a result, ``the Soviet Union and other Warsaw Treaty member
states, without waiting for the conclusion of Vienna accords, are
already taking steps toward unilateral cuts in their armed forces
(and) making them structurally incapable of attack,'' the Kremlin
said.
   The statement said withdrawal of Soviet troops in East Germany,
host to about two-thirds of the Soviet soldiers in Eastern Europe,
was a separate issue.
   ``The stay of foreign troops in both the GDR (East Germany) and
the Federal Republic of Germany is a special issue connected with
the Four Powers' obligations arising from the outcome of World War
II, and it may be tackled only with due regard to the security
interests of all the states concerned,'' the statement said.
   The ``Four Powers'' are the wartime Allies who defeated Nazi
Germany _ the United States, Soviet Union, Britain and France.
   The troop issue was discussed Saturday during a one-day visit by
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who enlisted the support of
Gorbachev for German unification.

   Here is a text of Nelson
Mandela's first public speech in nearly three decades, delivered
Sunday outside Cape Town's City Hall.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Comrades and fellow South Africans, I greet you all in the name
of peace, democracy and freedom for all. I stand here before you
not as a prophet, but as a humble servant of you, the people. Your
tireless and heroic sacrifices have made it possible for me to be
here today. I therefore place the remaining years of my life in
your hands.
   On this day of my release, I extend my sincere and warmest
gratitude to the millions of my compatriots and those in every
corner of the globe who have campaigned tirelessly for my release.
I extend special greetings to the people of Cape Town, the city to
which, which has been my home for three decades. Your mass
marchesand other forms of struggle have served as a constant source
of strength to all political prisoners.
   I salute the African National Congress. It has fulfilled our
every expectation in its role as leader of the great march to
freedom.
   I salute our president, Comrade Oliver Tambo for leading the ANC
even under the most difficult circumstances.
   I salute the rank and file members of the ANC: You have
sacrificed life and limb in the pursuit of the noble cause of our
struggle.
   I salute combatants of Umkhonto We Sizwe (the ANC's military
wing) ... who paid the ultimate price for the freedom of all South
Africans.
   I salute the South African Communist Party for its sterling
contribution to the struggle for democracy: You have survived 40
years of unrelenting persecution. The memory of great Communists
like ... Bram Fisher and Moses Mabhida will be cherished for
generations to come.
   I salute General-Secretary Joe Slovo, one of our finest
patriots. We are heartened by the fact that the alliance between
ourselves and the partyremains as strong as it always was.
   I salute the United Democratic Front, the National Education
Crisis Committee, the South African Youth Congress, the Transvaal
and NatalIndian Congresses, and COSATU, and the many other
formations of the mass democratic movement.
   I also salute the Black Sash, and the National Union of South
African Students. We note with pride that you have endured as the
conscience of white South Africans, even during the darkest days of
the history of our struggle: you held the flag of liberty high. The
large-scale mass mobilization of the past few years is one of the
key factors which led to the opening of the final chapter of our
struggle.
   I extend my greetings to the working class of our country, your
organized strength is the pride of our movement: You remain the
most dependable force in the struggle to end exploitation and
oppression.
   I pay tribute to the many religious communities who carried the
campaign for justice forward when the organizations of our people
were silenced.
   I greet the traditional leaders of our country: Many among you
continue to walk in the footsteps of great heroes....
   I pay tribute for the endless heroism of youth: You, the young
lions, You, the young lions have energized our entire struggle.
   I pay tribute to the mothersand wives and sisters of our nation:
you are the rock-hard foundation of our struggle. Apartheid has
inflicted more pain on you than on anyone else.
   On this occasion, we thank the world, we thank the world
community for their great contribution to the anti-apartheid
struggle. Without your support, our struggle would not have reached
this advanced stage.
   The sacrifice of the Front Line states will be remembered by
South Africans forever.
   My celebrations will be incomplete without expressing my deep
appreciation for the strength that's been given to me during my
long and gloomy years in prison by my beloved wife and family. I am
convinced that your pain and suffering was far greater than my own.
   Before I go any further, I wish to make the point that I intend
making only a few preliminary comments at this stage. I will make a
more complete statement only after I have had the opportunity to
consult with my comrades.
   Today, the majority of South Africans, black and white,
recognize that apartheid has no future. It has to be ended by our
own decisive mass action in order to build peace and security.
   The mass campaigns of defiance and other actions of our
organizations and people can only culminate in the establishment of
democracy.
   The apartheid's destruction on our subcontinent is incalculable.
The fabric of family life of millions of my people has been
shattered. Millions are homeless and unemployed. Our economy lies
in ruins and our people are embroiled in political strife.

<HEAD>CAPE TOWN, South Africa: political strife.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Our resort to the armed struggle in 1960 with the formation of
the military wing of the ANC (Umkhonto We Sizwe) was a purely
defensive action against the violence of apartheid. The factors
which necessitated the armed struggle still exist today. We have no
option but to continue. We express the hope that a climate
conducive to a negotiated settlement would be created soon, so that
there may no longer be the need for the armed struggle.
   I am a loyal and disciplined member of the African National
Congress. I am therefore in full agreement with all of its
objectives, strategies, and tactics.
   The need to unite the people of our country is as important a
task now as it always has been. No individual leader is able to
take all this enormous task on his own. It is our task as leaders
to place our views before our organization and to allow the
democratic structures to decide on the way forward.
   On the question of democratic practice, I feel duty-bound to
make the point that a leader of the movement is a person who has
been democratically elected at a national congress. This is a
principle which must be upheld without any exception.
   Today, I wish to report to you that my talks with the government
have been aimed at normalizing the political situation in the
country. We have not yet begun discussing the basic demands of the
struggle. I wish to stress that I myself have at no time entered
negotiations about the future of our country, except to insist on a
meeting between the ANC and the government.
   Mr. de Klerk has gone further than any other nationalist
president in taking real steps to normalize the situation. However,
there are further steps as outlined in the Harare declaration that
have to be met before negotiations on the basic demands of our
people can begin.
   I reiterate our call for inter-alia, the immediate ending of the
state of emergency, and the freeing of all _ and not only some _
political prisoners.
   Only such a normalized situation which allows for free political
activity can allow us to consult our people in order to obtain a
mandate.
   The people need to be consulted on who will negotiate and on the
content of such negotiations.
   Negotiations cannot take place. Negotiations cannot take up
their place above the heads or behind the backs of our people.
   It is our belief that the future of our country can only be
determined by a body which is democratically elected on a
non-racial basis.
   Negotiations on the dismantling of apartheid will have to
address the overwhelming demands of our people for a democratic,
non-racial, and unitary South Africa.
   There must be an end to white monopoly on political power, and a
fundamental restructuring of our political and economic systems to
ensure that the inequalities of apartheid are addressed, andour
society thoroughly democratized.
   It must be addedthat Mr. de Klerk himself is a man of integrity
who is acutely aware of the dangers of a public figure not honoring
his undertaking.
   But as an organization we base our policy and our strategy on
the harsh reality we are faced with, and this reality is that we
are still suffering under the policies of the nationalist
government.
   Our struggle has reached a decisive moment: We call on our
people to seize this moment, so that the process towards democracy
is rapid and uninterrupted.
   We have waited too long for our freedom. We can no longer wait.
Now is the time to intensify the struggle on all fronts. To relax
our efforts now would be a mistake which generations to come will
not be able to forgive.
   The sight of freedom looming on the horizon should encourage us
to redouble our efforts. It is only through disciplined mass action
that our victory can be assured.
   We call on our white compatriots to join us in the shaping of a
new South Africa. The freedom movement is a political home for you,
too.
   We call on the international community to continue the campaign
to isolate the apartheid regime. To lift sanctions now would run
the risk of aborting the process towards the complete eradication
of apartheid.
   Our march toward freedom is irreversible. We must not allow fear
to stand in our way.
   Universal suffrage on a common voter's roll in a united,
democratic, and non-racial South Africa is the only way to peace
and racial harmony.
   In conclusion, I wish to go to my own words during my trial in
1964 _ they are as true today as they were then:
   ``I have fought against white domination, and I have fought
against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a
democratic and free society in which all persons live together in
harmony and with equal opportunity. It is an ideal which I hope to
live for and to achieve. But, if need be, it is an ideal for which
I am prepared to die.''

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is sidestepping a
striking snub from President Corazon Aquino and moving ahead with
plans to meet top Philippine military officials on the future of
U.S. forces in the unsettled country.
   Cheney, here on the opening leg of a two-week tour of Asian
allied nations, did not respond to Mrs. Aquino's refusal to meet
with him on his first visit to her country as defense secretary.
   ``He doesn't take it personally. We're still going to the
Philippines and we expect productive meetings,'' Cheney's
spokesman, Pete Williams, said Sunday.
   Cheney scheduled a full day of sessions with U.S. military
chiefs from the Army, Navy and Air Force as well as touring a
guided missile cruiser and lunching with the troops.
   While Cheney declined to offer a personal reaction to the latest
rough spot in U.S.-Philippines relations, he did decide to slice a
day off his scheduled Feb. 18-20 stop in the Philippines.
   The defense secretary also is slated to visit South Korea, Hong
Kong and Japan over the next two weeks to assess the U.S. military
posture in the Pacific in the wake of calls in Congress for sharp
defense budget cuts and demands that nations hosting U.S. forces
increase their contributions to the mutual defense.
   There are some 190,000 U.S. military personnel in the regions
Cheney is to visit.
   U.S.-Philippine talks on renewing the lease on the strategically
placed American bases, Clark Air Base and Subic Naval Base, are
expected to begin next month.
   Mrs. Aquino, in a weekend speech, said she would not meet Cheney
after expressing unhappiness over U.S. payments for the bases and
negative U.S. media reports about her government's efficacy in
light of a series of coup attempts.
   Even though a meeting with Mrs. Aquino had not formally been
placed on Cheney's schedule, she has routinely met with such
high-ranking officials.
   Mrs. Aquino met Sunday with representatives of the Palestinian
Liberation Organization to sign an agreement to exchange diplomatic
missions soon, Abdul Latif Abu Hajleh, director-general of the
PLO's political department, said early today.
   Her decision not to meet with Cheney is noteworthy in light of
President Bush's decision to send U.S. Air Force jets to her aid
during the latest coup attempt Dec. 1.
   Williams said Cheney now plans to spend only a day and a half in
the Philippines and will meet with his counterpart, Defense
Secretary Fidel Ramos.
   Williams said U.S. officials don't see Mrs. Aquino's
announcement as a setback and noted that the defense secretary
hadn't intended to negotiate about renewing the lease agreement on
the U.S. military bases.
   Cheney, in comments to reporters, warned that the United States
will have no choice but to leave its huge Philippines bases unless
a new agreement is reached ``with terms we can accept.''
   ``I'm not here to negotiate on the bases. ... Obviously, we are
interested in renewing the base rights agreement,'' Cheney said.
``It's only going to happen if both parties can reach an acceptable
understanding. It has to be on the basis that the Filipinos want us
there and in accordance with terms that we can accept.''
   ``The situation in the Philippines continues to be of concern,''
the secretary added, echoing expressions of concern by U.S.
officials about dangers of renewed coup attempts and continued
corruption in Mrs. Aquino's government.
   Bush ordered F-4 Phantom jets into the air over Manila to pin
down rebel units during the December coup, a move that later gave
rise to complaints from Mrs. Aquino's critics that she was beholden
to the U.S. government.
   Ramos has been seen as a presidential contender in the country's
1992 elections, but his decision to seek U.S. assistance during the
coup has reportedly diminished his popularity as well.
   In 1988, then-Secretary of State George Shultz agreed to pay
$962 million for the use of Clark, Subic and four smaller bases
during the final two years of the 1947 agreement.
   The Bush administration asked Congress to provide $200 million
in military assistance and $160 million in economic support funds,
but Congress cut the figure by $96 million and U.S. officials in
Manila have said there is no chance the reductions will be restored.

<HEAD>Moldavians at Rally Demand Political Independence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of Moldavians rallied in their
capital to demand independence from the Kremlin, the official Tass
news agency said today.
   At Sunday's four-hour rally in Kishinev, speakers from the
Moldavian People's Front demanded social and economic independence
from Moscow, a new constitution, laws on sovereignty, and the right
to emigrate, Tass said.
   Authorities of the republic sanctioned the rally, which was
organized by the People's Front. It was addressed by members of the
front; representatives of informal groups; and Pyotr Luchinsky,
first secretary of the republic's Communist Party, the news agency
said.
   Speakers for the front urged the election of a new Moldavian
legislature to ensure sovereignty in a revamped Soviet federation.
   Luchinsky urged the people not to get carried away by emotion
and make unrealistic suggestions.
   People's fronts and various ethnic groups across the Soviet
Union, and especially in the northwestern Baltic republics, are
demanding independence from Moscow. Lithuania's Communist Party
broke away from the national party in December.
   The Moldavian People's Front already has won its battle to
establish Moldavian as the official language and a return to the
Latin alphabet instead of the Cyrillic used by Russians. Moldavia
is adjacent to Romania and shares the same spoken language.
   Moldavians go to the polls on Feb. 25 to elect republican and
local officials. The front's candidates are expected to do well.

<HEAD>Theater Swept By Fire; Luxury Savoy Hotel Evacuated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A wind-whipped fire ravaged the 109-year-old Savoy
Theater in London early today and forced an evacuation of the
celebrated Savoy Hotel next door, police said.
   The theater was empty at the time, and no one was reported
injured.
   The London fire brigade said in a statement that 60 percent of
the theater in The Strand, central London, was ablaze when firemen
arrived shortly after 1:30 a.m.
   Guests from the Savoy Hotel, including actor Richard Harris,
were evacuated to the Strand Palace Hotel across the street as
flames fanned by strong winds shot through the roof of the theater
and lit up the night sky.
   Terry Robinson, a kitchen cleaner at the hotel, said, ``At first
there was just dense smoke, and then all of a sudden it went up
like a tinder box with the flames roaring away.''
   Authorities said the Savoy Hotel suffered only minor damage.
   The Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, quoted an
unidentified policeman as saying: ``The wind was so strong that it
was blowing the firemen's jets away before the water could reach
the fire.''
   Wearing a white Savoy Hotel dressing gown and sipping tea as he
watched firemen tackle the blaze, Harris told reporters he was in
bed learning lines when he heard the hotel fire alarm.
   He said he walked downstairs because he had been told that
people should not use elevators in a fire.
   Harris, 58, is due to appear in Luigi Pirandello's play ``Henry
IV'' at The Haymarket theater in London later this year.
   The Savoy Theater, which can seat 1,123 people, was built in
1881. It was financed by Richard D'Oyly Carte for production of the
hugely popular comic operas of the day by Sir William Gilbert and
Sir Arthur Sullivan.
   The theater was the first public building in London to be lit by
electricity. The current show there is ``It's Magic,'' starring
magician Paul Daniels.
   The Savoy Hotel, which was built by D'Oyly Carte, opened in 1889
and swiftly gained a reputation as one of the world's grandest
hotels frequented by the rich and famous. The best suites currently
cost about $845 a night.

<HEAD>Inventor Of Velcro, Nature's Fastener, Is Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COMMUGNY, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inventor George De Mestral, whose
Velcro fastener stuck so well with the public it replaced millions
of buttons and zippers, has died at his home, his wife said today.
He was 82.
   De Mestral's wife, Helen, said he died Thursday from
complications of bronchitis and other lung problems. He had been
sick for about three weeks, she said by telephone from their home
in this village near Lake Geneva.
   A Swiss mechanical engineer, De Mestral in 1941 conceived a
fastener using two fabric strips _ one covered with tiny hooks, the
other with a fuzzy web the hooks could grab.
   Patented after 10 years of refinement, Velcro entered production
in several countries in the mid-1950s. The fastener, which can also
be used to replace adhesive tape, soon became a worldwide success.
   It is especially known in the fashion industry. But it also was
used in the U.S. spaceship that took astronauts to the moon in 1969.
   Despite its high-tech look, Velcro was inspired by nature.
   A passionate hunter, De Mestral came home once from a day in the
fields and found burrs stuck to his pants. The idea of velcro was
born when he examined the burrs under a microscope and found their
surface to consist of little hooks.
   De Mestral's widow said she had no estimate of how much his
invention earned.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tanks of a renegade Christian general
pounded rival forces around mountain resorts today in a possible
prelude to an offensive in the nearly 2-week-old battle, police
said.
   In the rain-soaked streets of east Beirut, soldiers of Gen.
Michel Aoun and the rival militia fighters clashed with automatic
weapons and hand grenades, police reported.
   Aoun has been struggling to deliver a knockout blow by seizing
strongholds of the Lebanese Forces militia, led by Samir Geagea.
They are battling for control of the country's Christian enclave.
   There was no word on casualties in the latest clashes. The
fighting has killed at least 457 people and wounded 1,701 since the
fighting began Jan. 30.
   It has been the worst bloodletting by rival Christian forces in
the nearly 15-year-old civil war that usually pits Christians
against Moslems. Neither side has made significant gains since
Aoun's troops captured a major militia base in the coastal town of
Dbaye, north of the capital, nine days ago.
   Police said Aoun's army was concentrating on a new front in the
mountain province of Kesrouan, 15 miles northeast of Beirut.
   His tanks pushed into a militia-held triangle formed by the
resort towns of Daraya, Kleiat and Ajaltoun below the ski slopes in
the Kesrouan mountains, police reported.
   A spokesman, who cannot be identified under standing
regulations, said the hit-and-run attacks appeared to be aimed at
softening up Lebanese Forces defenses before a large-scale assault
to encircle the main militia stronghold at Jounieh, a port 12 miles
north of the capital.
   Relief groups and Christian religious leaders issued fresh
appeals for a humanitarian cease-fire to allow civil defense teams
to recover at least two dozen decomposing bodies from the streets.
But there appeared to be no let-up in the fighting or sniper fire.
   Civilians trapped in underground shelters for most of the past
two weeks took advantage of occasional lulls to dash across
Beirut's Green Line into the Moslem sector.
   ``The snipers shot a woman running ahead of me,'' Therese Yakoub
said after she sprinted 500 yards across the Green Line.
   ``Poor thing, she has five children, and she was planning to buy
bread and powdered milk for them,'' Ms. Yakoub said.
   President Elias Hrawi appealed again to the superpowers, France
and the Vatican to support possible intervention by his
Syrian-backed troops to halt the fighting.
   Hrawi, Aoun and Geagea are all Maronite Catholics, the sect that
has dominated the government, army, and police since Lebanon's
independence from France in 1943.
   Aoun refuses to recognize Hrawi's government and considers
himself the sole legitimate authority in Lebanon. He was appointed
head of an interim military cabinet in 1988 by outgoing president
Amin Gemayel until a successor could be elected.
   Hrawi was elected by Parliament in November with a mandate to
carry out a peace plan brokered by the Arab League. It gives more
power to the Moslems.
   Aoun rejects the plan because it does not provide for a complete
withdrawal by Syria's 40,000 troops, who have been in Lebanon since
1976 under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate. Those forces
control most of the country.
   Geagea has taken no public stand on the latest peace accord but
recognizes Hrawi.

   The armed and masked bandits who made off with a
good chunk of a day's receipts from Bloomingdale's flagship store
were still at large today and still had officials trying to count
how much the robbers hauled off.
   The take for the Saturday night holdup was estimated at between
$100,000 and $500,000. It probably will be the middle of the week
before a precise amount is determined, police spokesman Sgt. Ed
Burns said Sunday.
   Officer Janice Swinney said today that the bandits were still at
large and the audit was not complete.
   Three security guards at the fashionable Manhattan department
store, carrying the day's receipts in a locked cart, were leaving a
freight elevator when they were confronted by robbers armed with a
sawed-off rifle and a gun, police said. The thieves used bolt
cutters on the lock.
   Police recovered a sawed-off rifle, two ski masks, a pair of
gloves and a set of handcuffs.
   The New York-based Bloomingdale's chain is owned by heavily
indebted Campeau Corp., a Canadian retail and real-estate company
that owns strings of department store chains in the United States.
   Campeau recently filed for bankruptcy protection on behalf of
its U.S. retail divisions, Allied Stores Corp. and Federated
Department Stores Inc., both based in Cincinnati. Federated is
Bloomingdale's parent.

<TEXT>
   Pakistani troops fired on Indian
security forces who stopped a mob of Pakistani protesters from
storming across the border into disputed Kashmir, officials said
today.
   At least three demonstrators were killed Sunday night, a Defense
Ministry spokesman said in Islamabad. Pakistan's state-run TV said
the Indian guards killed as many as six.
   The trouble started after Indian border guards opened fire on
hundreds of Pakistanis who tried to cross a cease-fire line
separating Pakistan-controlled Kashmir from the Indian-held region.
   A spokesman for the Indian Defense Ministry said Pakistani
troops then fired about 200 rounds from light and medium weapons at
Indian border posts in the Uri sector.
   Indian forces returned fire and the exchange continued for about
half an hour, the spokesman said. No one was hurt.
   A Pakistani official in Islamabad denied the accusations.
   ``Pakistani military authorities and the Foreign Secretary are
in touch with Indian authorities to remove the misunderstanding,''
said Additional Foreign Secretary Khalid Mahmood in Islamabad.
   Pakistan's top diplomat in New Delhi, Bashir Babar, was summoned
to India's Foreign Ministry on Sunday and today and apprised of
India's concern over the events, an Indian government spokesman
said.
   A fluid 840-mile cease-fire line separates the Indian and
Pakistani Kashmirs. Pakistan and Indian twice have gone to war over
Kashmir, in 1948 and again in 1965.
   On Feb. 5, at least one person was killed and 12 wounded when
Pakistani mobs tried to cross the cease-fire line near Jammu, 95
miles to the south.
   The two demonstrations at the cease-fire line were to express
support for Moslem militants who are fighting for independence for
the Moslem-dominated state from the predominantly Hindu India.
   On Sunday, the Pakistani mob retreated when soldiers of India's
paramilitary border security force opened fire, said the Indian
spokesman who refused to be identified.
   ``The mob returned a second time by which time it had become
slightly dark,'' he said. ``That is when the Pakistani troops
opened fire.''
   A Pakistani spokesman, who also refused to be identified, said
Pakistani army patrols repulsed a mob of some 1,200 demonstrators.
Small groups broke away from the crowd and slipped into the
Indian-held territory, he said.
   An official of the Indian border security force, which normally
patrols the border, said the Indian army today took control of the
cease-fire line.
   Some men in the intruding crowd were armed with guns which they
fired occasionally, he said.
   ``It was becoming very difficult, our troops had to open fire,''
he said.
   Farouk Haider, vice-president of the militant Jammu-Kashmir
Liberation Front that is leading the uprising, said in Islamabad
after the Indian firing that ``the situation is very confusing.''
   Thirty-one people were wounded in the shooting, Haider said.
Five were in critical condition in a hospital in Muzzafarabad, the
capital of Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, he said, adding he knew of
only one death.
   The 40-year-old conflict over Kashmir flared Jan. 20 after a
government crackdown and the arrest of 250 suspected militants.
Most of them were subsequently released, but the arrests sparked
widespread violence.
   At least 85 people have been killed since the crackdown began.
Most of the victims have been curfew-breaking protesters shot by
security forces in Srinagar.
   Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir, has been the
center of the secessionist movement that has turned violent in
recent years.
   The Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front had earlier campaigned for
union with Islamic Pakistan but has in recent years demanded
independence and the status of a neutral country.
   About 64 percent of Jammu-Kashmir's 6 million people are
Moslems, making it the only Moslem majority state in predominantly
Hindu India's 25 states.
   Nationwide, Moslems make up 12 percent of India's 880 million
population. Hindus comprise 82 percent.

<HEAD>East Germany Asks Bonn For Up To $9 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany today asked the Bonn government
for as much as $9 billion in financial aid in what it called a
``contribution of solidarity'' to help the state-run economy out of
its growing crisis.
   As pressure toward German reunification continued to grow, a
Cabinet minister in East Berlin accused West Germany of waging a
``psychological campaign'' against the government.
   Negotiators representing the Communists, their coalition
partners and pro-democracy forces met this morning for their 12th
session in East Berlin. The national discussions were broadcast
live on East German television.
   They adopted a request to the West German government for a
contribution of between $6 billion and $9 billion, a sum they said
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl promised at a December meeting
in Dresden with Premier Hans Modrow.
   The negotiators rejected a Bonn proposal to join the two
nations' currencies as a way to prop up the East German mark. The
move bars Modrow from dealing with the issue during his trip to
Bonn, which begins Tuesday.
   East German Cabinet Minister Wolfgang Ullmann, of the Democracy
Now group, bitterly criticized the Bonn government at the start of
today's session.
   ``Bonn is trying to discredit the government here at home and to
put it under international pressure,'' Ullmann said.
   Citing an assertion from a high-ranking West German official
that East Germany was near bankruptcy and considering moving up the
election date, he said West Germans were waging a ``psychological
campaign'' against Modrow's government.
   East Germany's first free elections are scheduled for March 18.
A peaceful revolution last year swept the hard-line Communist
leadership from power.
   Ullmann also said the Communist premier has had to learn about
West Germany's positions regarding unification ``from reading the
newspapers rather than from the usual diplomatic channels.''
   The pace toward unification quickened over the weekend after
Kohl brought back from Moscow what he called a ``green light'' from
the Soviet leadership.
   He said Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had not attached
any conditions to approving the historic step of unification.
   On Sunday, West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher
said he hoped a final unification plan could be worked out and
presented to a full European summit in October or November, and
unification completed this year.
   He emphasized that the World War II allies France, Britain, the
United States and the Soviet Union also would be involved in
drafting the plan with officials of the two German states.

<TEXT>
   In his first public outing since
checking into a treatment center last month, Washington, D.C.,
Mayor Marion Barry went to church and admitted a dependence on
alcohol, members of the church said.
   Barry surprised worshipers at New Macedonia Missionary Baptist
Church with his Sunday morning appearance and a short speech, said
the Rev. Thomas Masters, the church's pastor.
   ``Part of the recovery process is having a spiritual focus,''
Masters said. ``We were full of love, forgiveness and support for
him.''
   Masters said he did not know why Barry chose his church for the
service, in which entertainer Ben Vereen also addressed the
congregation of 500.
   The church is about a mile away from the Hanley-Hazelden Center
in West Palm Beach. Barry began a 28-day treatment program at the
center Jan. 22 after the FBI and Washington police arrested him and
charged him with cocaine possession.
   Vereen, whose appearance was expected, is doing local
perfomances, Masters said.
   Barry sat with the congregation during the three-hour service,
clapping and nodding to the songs and speeches, members said. He
gave an impromptu, five-minute talk near the end of the visit, they
said.
   Barry said he was dependent on alcohol but did not mention
cocaine, churchgoer Stephanie Strong said.
   ``He said he had a friend bigger than the U.S. attorney, and
that friend is Jesus Christ,'' she added. ``He said he would go
back to Washington and face his problems.''
   Police in Washington have said they secretly taped the mayor
smoking crack. But his staff said he checked into Hanley-Hazelden
for alcoholism treatment.

   A white security guard today
shot and killed one of a group of club-carrying blacks who chased
and cornered him during a celebration of Nelson Mandela's release,
police said.
   The guard was harassed and chased along a central Johannesburg
street by about 50 revelers, and fired after he was cornered by
members of the group carrying bricks and clubs, Capt. Eugene
Opperman said. Four bystanders were wounded by shotgun pellets.
   In Cape Town, a bomb blast early today caused extensive damage
at the ticket office of a stadium where a boycott-breaking English
cricket team is due to play this week, police said.
   It blew out windows of the office at Newlads stadium in Cape
Town, and damaged the roof and wall, local cricket administrator
Kevin Commins said. It was believed to have been caused by a limpet
mine, a mine that can be attached to objects.
   Two other limpet-mine blasts were reported in the area late
Sunday, causing slight damage at government office buildings in the
towns of Paarl and Parow. Paarl is the location of Victor Verster
prison farm, where African National Congress leader Mandela was
held until his release Sunday.
   Police reported 16 additional deaths in political unrest across
South Africa, raising to about 30 the number of blacks killed in
the 24 hours ending at daybreak today.
   Twelve of the deaths were in Mpumalanga, a black township in
Natal Province. More than 2,500 people have been killed in Natal in
the past three years in a power-struggle between supporters of the
ANC and Inkatha, a more conservative Zulu political organization.
   The English cricket team, led by former England captain Mike
Gatting, has been the target of repeated black protests since
arriving last month for a six-week tour that violates the
international sports boycott of South Africa.
   Gatting's team was beaten decisively in a weekend match against
the South African national team last week and begins a second match
at Newlands on Friday.

<TEXT>
   Billionaire Donald Trump, who amassed a fortune
with his name written all over it, wants to call it quits with his
wife of 12 years, who has appeared to be a partner in the building
of his empire.
   The owner of the Trump Shuttle airline, Trump Tower skyscraper
and Trump casinos has a prenuptial contract giving his wife, Ivana,
about $20 million of his reported $1.7 billion worth, according to
a statement issued Sunday on behalf of the flamboyant tycoon.
She'll also get their 45-room country home in Greenwich, Conn.
   Trump, 43, told his wife Tuesday before he left for Tokyo that
the marriage ``just wasn't working out,'' said the statement.
   ``Ivana is a wonderful woman and a very good woman and I like
her. We might even get back together. I can't say we won't. Who
knows what could happen?'' the Daily News quoted Trump as saying.
   In his statement, Trump denied rumors that he has romanced other
women. A comment attributed to the megamillionaire in the New York
Post brought up the specter of quite another kind of woman.
   ``I like Ivana, but we've grown apart,'' the Post quoted him as
saying, citing an unidentified ``intimate.''
   ``Her level of arrogance has grown steadily worse in recent
years,'' Trump said, according to the Post account. ``The bottom
line is I don't want to create another Leona Helmsley.'' Ms.
Helmsley is the self-styled hotel queen, convicted last year of
income tax violations, who has long been accused of arrogance
toward underlings.
   The Czechoslovakian-born Mrs. Trump, a former model and an
alternate on her native country's 1972 Olympic ski team, used to
manage the Trump Castle casino in Atlantic City, N.J., and has been
in charge of renovations at the Plaza Hotel in New York City.
   When she got the Plaza job, her husband joked that she would be
paid ``one dollar plus all the dresses she can buy.''
   Trump moved out of the couple's 50-room triplex in Trump Tower
following his return from his trip to watch the Mike Tyson-Buster
Douglas boxing match, the Post said today.
   The Daily News reported Sunday that the 40-year-old Mrs. Trump
was devastated because her husband was betraying her, but Trump
denied that.
   ``And as for those other women I have been linked with, well, I
want to say that we are all just friends and that's as far as it
goes,'' he said.
   The statement did not address which parent would have custody of
the couple's three children, Donald Jr., 12, Ivancka, 8, and Eric,
6.
   Forbes magazine says Trump is worth around $1.7 billion, ranking
him 19th on its 1989 list of America's 400 richest people. He is
the author of the best-selling ``The Art of the Deal'' and has even
lent his name to a syndicated TV quiz show, ``Trump Card.''

urging an immediate easing of sanctions to reward South Africa's
white rulers.
   Most others said South African President F.W. de Klerk has a
long way to go before apartheid is abolished.
   People celebrated the news Sunday night in the streets of
Toronto and London. In Amsterdam, they draped buses and trams with
the flags of his African National Congress.
   In the United States, which imposes some of the harshest
sanctions of any of South Africa's major trading partners,
President Bush telephoned Mandela Sunday to congratulate him on his
release but said afterward, ``I am not prepared to express my view
on sanctions at this time.''
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said today
that ``together with all countries and peoples we hail the release
of Nelson Mandela.''
   He said Mandela's release was a ``step that should have been
taken long ago,'' and he expressed hope that ``an end would finally
be put to the policy of apartheid.''
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who has often argued
that strict sanctions hurt South African blacks, stood alone in
saying it is now time to use encouragement in South Africa, not
sanctions.
   On Sunday, as Mandela walked free after 27 years in jail, Mrs.
Thatcher wrote to fellow leaders of the 12-nation European
Community urging a ``more positive'' approach.
   ``When people are doing the right thing boldly and courageously
as President de Klerk is, it seems quite absurd to still use sticks
to beat them with, however small those sticks may be,'' she said.
   But she abruptly canceled a news conference Sunday night at her
10 Downing Street residence after Mandela told a vast crowd in Cape
Town that his African National Congress should continue the armed
struggle and sanctions should remain in place.
   Britain intends to press the sanctions issue at a Feb. 20
meeting of group's foreign ministers in Dublin, Ireland. The main
sanctions are bans on imports of steel, iron and Krugerrand gold
coins.
   The Nigerian government said Mandela's release was ``positive
proof'' that international sanctions are working.
   In Brussels, European Community leaders indicated today they
feel it is still too early to lift the mild economic sanctions the
community imposed on South Africa in 1986.
   EC Development Commissioner Manuel Marin ``believes there can be
no question of a lifting of the sanctions now,'' said a community
source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Foreign Minister Joe Clark of Canada said his country's
sanctions will stay in force until apartheid laws of racial
dicrimination are scrapped.
   In Toronto, crowds danced and cheered at a street party Sunday
night to celebrate Mandela's freedom.
   In London, thousands of well-wishers held a street party Sunday
outside the South African Embassy, where anti-apartheid
demonstrators had manned a round-the-clock vigil since April 1986
to demand Mandela's release.
   In Amsterdam, buses and trams carried ANC flags. In the city
center, thousands of people marched Sunday to the Leidseplein,
renamed Nelson Mandela Square for the day.
   President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia called on the ANC to suspend
guerrilla actions in South Africa but to maintain its military
capability in case of violence by right-wing extremists.
   ``The time for talking has come,'' said Kaunda, whose country
plays host to the ANC's exile headquarters and guerrilla bases.
   But the ANC said in a statement released in Harare that it was
not prepared to open talks with the government of South Africa
until it lifts a state of emergency, releases all political
prisoners, and repeals all apartheid laws of racial segregation.
   In Harare, Zimbabwe, President Robert Mugabe today hailed
Mandela's release but urged Britain and other Western nations not
to reduce pressures on the South Africa to end apartheid. Mugabe
criticized Mrs. Thatcher for ``too hasty an embrace'' of political
changes in South Africa.
   The Organization of African Unity, based in Addis Ababa,
Ethiopia, hailed the freeing of Mandela and other political leaders
as a ``significant step toward the elimination of apartheid and the
establishment of a non-racial and democratic society.''
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan said Mandela's release was
a ``clear turning point'' that would allow South Africa to move
toward democracy. Japan is among countries that have imposed
sanctions against South Africa.
   Poland's Solidarity leader Lech Walesa called Mandela a man who
devoted his life to realizing the ideal of equality.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said Mandela's
release and de Klerk's reforms ``mark a turning point in the
process for the peaceful settlement of the political situation.''
   In Beijing, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said China was ``very
happy'' about the release of a man ``respected by all the
justice-upholding people the world over,'' the official Xinhua news
agency reported.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, who at 87 is the oldest
member of Congress, returned to his hometown today to announce his
intention to seek another six years in Congress.
   ``In all my years of public service, I have never felt a
stronger obligation to continue my work for the future of our state
and our nation,'' Thurmond told a small crowd of supporters
gathered at the Aiken Municipal Airport.
   Thurmond, who was first elected to the Senate in 1954, briefly
laid out his priorities for what would be his seventh term,
touching on education, quality of life and the need to protect the
environment against hazardous waste and pollution.
   The lawmaker, who became the oldest member of Congress when
Florida Rep. Claude Pepper died last year at the age of 88,
indicated his seniority in the Senate would help him better serve
his constituents.
   ``I wouldn't elect a man just because of his seniority, but if
he has all the other qualifications then it should be counted, and
it is very helpful,'' he said.
   Thurmond is the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary
Committee.
   He made known his plans to seek another term in a letter
recently mailed to supporters. In it he said he has ``always looked
upon public service as a sacred obligation and a public trust.''
   Thurmond, who celebrated his 87th birthday in December, said at
the time his secret for a long life is a good diet, exercise and an
optimistic outlook. A new term would expire about the time he turns
94.
   He also said then that he owes it to the people of the state to
seek re-election and, ``I might be letting them down if I leave
now.''
   A former governor, state senator and judge who ran
unsuccessfully for president as a Dixiecrat in 1948, Thurmond
switched from the Democratic to the Republican parties in 1964. He
served as president pro tempore of the U.S. Senate from 1981
through 1987.

<HEAD>Critics Question Ethics of Using Unknowing Welfare Recipients in
Study</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Experts in ethics are questioning a federal
experiment that denies supplemental aid to some indigent people in
Texas and four other states to determine how well they can live
without it.
   Extra Medicaid and child-care benefits now go to about 8,000
people in Texas to encourage them to keep new jobs, while about 800
people _ selected at random by birth date _ are excluded as a
control or comparison group.
   On April 1, those extra benefits will be available to more than
50,000 people statewide _ but not to the 800 unlucky Texans who
face two more years without the extra help, The Dallas Morning News
reported Sunday.
   The study aims to see how well the new expanded programs wean
people off the welfare rolls.
   Similar experiments are being conducted in Ohio, Washington
state, New York and Wisconsin, federal officials told the newspaper
last week.
   Though federal officials say denying the additional benefits to
small, so-called control groups is vital to determine whether the
new programs work, critics disagree.
   ``People ought not to be treated like things, even if what you
get is good information,'' said Philip Broyle, associate director
for medical ethics of the Hastings Center, a New York think tank
concerned with the ethics of experiments on people.
   Broyle said the study violates the kinds of federal standards
medical experiments must meet. Those standards include informed
consent _ that anyone in an experiment must be aware of it and of
all its consequences. And they must have the option to refuse
participation.
   Neither informed consent nor the right of refusal was offered to
participants in the welfare study, officials said.
   The pilot program rewards welfare recipients who find jobs or
job training. Traditionally, such recipients have received four
months of free medical care, plus some child care, after they leave
the welfare rolls. The experimental program extended the benefits
to one year of Medicaid coverage and subsidized child care _ to all
but the 800.
   The theory is that the extended benefits will encourage people
to take and stay with entry-level jobs that are unlikely to offer
medical insurance or child care immediately. And the tax money
saved by getting those people off welfare will more than balance
the cost of the new program.
   State officials said last week that they would try to break
their contract with the federal government and provide the benefits
to the 800.
   ``We're planning to argue with them,'' said Claudia Langguth,
deputy commissioner for the client self-support division of the
Texas Department of Human Services.
   In 1988, Congress decreed that people receiving benefits from
Aid to Families with Dependent Children and Medicaid and who get a
job or job training would be eligible for the extended benefits
beginning April 1, 1990.
   Texas officials decided they wanted to try offering the new
benefits a year early on a small scale.
   They got federal money for pilot programs in five urban areas
but were required to exclude about 10 percent of those eligible _
the control or comparison group _ to see if they stay off welfare
without the extra benefits.
   Federal officials say they were aware of the ethical question
involved in the experiment.
   ``That issue was recognized and considered in the review of the
Texas proposal,'' said Sidney Trieger, director of the federal
division of health systems and special studies of the Health Care
Financing Administration. He is in charge of evaluating the
experimental results.
   ``It was worth proceeding,'' he said.

<HEAD>Conference On Acid Rain Reviews Decade-Long Assessment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists who have spent the past
decade assessing the impact of acid rain on the nation will share
their results this week with their counterparts from around the
globe.
   The National Acidic Rain Assessment Program, a consortium of 11
federal agencies, was established 10 years ago by Congress and has
spent $500 million investigating the problem.
   It is holding a conference on Hilton Head Island to review data
from the studies.
   One conclusion likely to provoke controversy at the conference
is that acid rain generally isn't harming the nation's forests,
said Joseph Barnard, a U.S. Forest Service researcher, who headed
the work of forest scientists, The Charlotte (N.C.) Observer said
in Saturday editions.
   The newspaper said it obtained a report expected to be presented
at the conference, intended to summarize various scientific studies
of acid rain. The report says that ozone does far more damage to
trees than acid rain, although acid rain may be harming red spruces
in the Appalachians northward to New England.
   The World Resources Institute, a Washington-based environmental
group, disputes the findings, saying ``evidence is unambiguous''
that acid rain and ozone both contribute to the deaths of trees in
the South, East and West.
   According to the newspaper, the report also says that a national
survey found that only 4 percent of the nation's lakes and 6
percent of the streams were acidic.
   Researcher Lawrence Baker of the University of Minnesota said
that eventually the soils will be unable to neutralize any more
acid. ``The question is, 10, 50, 100 years,'' Baker said. ``There's
quite a bit of debate on that.''
   Acid rain is a combination of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide
that mixes in the atmosphere and can be carried hundreds of miles
before falling back to earth as rain, snow, fog and dust particles,
affecting aquatic life, trees and humans.
   Much of the pollution comes from power plants which burn high
sulphur coal although other industrial facilities also generate the
pollutants.
   About 1,000 researchers have been at work during the past decade
compiling 28 draft studies on the impact of acid rain.
   ``The whole purpose is to give outsiders a chance to critique
the reports. It's a chance to get them out into the broader
scientific community,'' said Chuck Herrick, a spokesman for the
agency who said the review is probably the most comprehensive ever
compiled.
   Later, information from the technical reports will be integrated
into a final document. The computer models will be used to map
various emission control strategies.
   Herrick said ``we will be running 30 scenarios for the future.
The assumption then is the policy people will be looking at this
and will be able to make their decisions.''
   The agency itself is not mandated to make policy decisions,
simply provide policy-makers with the best data possible, he added.
   President Bush unveiled his clean air bill last year _ a measure
that would sharply reduce urban smog, toxic chemical air pollution
and acid rain by the end of the decade.
   Bush has called for a 10 million ton reduction in sulfur dioxide
_ one of the main ingredients in acid rain _ by the turn of the
century.
   While the administration unveiled its legislation before the
agency assessments were released, ``I don't know that the
conclusion is that the administration bill is wholly lacking in
scientific basis,'' Herrick said.
   ``Our people were extensively contacted. The argument could be
made the bill does have a scientific basis,'' he added.
   He said 600 scientists from 35 nations are attending the
conference, which opened Sunday and continues through Friday.

<TEXT>
   Nicholas Ashford, foreign editor of The
Independent and a veteran South Africa and Washington
correspondent, has died of cancer, the newspaper said today. He was
47.
   Ashford was appointed foreign editor last year, after serving as
deputy foreign editor since the paper was launched in 1986. He
became ill last August, when he gave up his weekly column on world
affairs, and died Saturday.
   Ashford was a foreign and diplomatic correspondent for The Times
of London before joining The Independent. In a front-page article
in today's Independent, friends and colleagues praised him as a
dedicated and talented writer and journalist.
   After a brief stint as a military officer, he began his career
at The Middle East News Agency in 1966. He joined The Financial
Times in 1967 and moved on to The Times in 1969. He covered
southern Africa from 1975 to 1981, then became Washington
correspondent until 1985. From 1985 to 1986, he was diplomatic
correspondent based in London.
   Ashford is survived by a daughter from his first marriage,
Dominique, and by his second wife, Giuliana.

   Americans danced in the streets and in church aisles to
celebrate Nelson Mandela's release from a South African prison, but
one of his daughters said much work remains before apartheid is
abolished.
   ``This is only the first step, a little step, and we should not
forget this,'' Makaziwe Mandela-Amuah said Sunday in Amherst,
Mass., where she attends Boston University.
   ``The battle is not over. It's only starting at a renewed,
higher level.'' Activists at events around the country rejoiced
that the 71-year-old African National Congress founder was released
after 27 years in prison. But many said U.S. sanctions against
South Africa must continue until the nation's white-minority rulers
grant non-whites basic rights.
   ``By freeing Nelson Mandela, South Africa has taken the first
step toward freeing itself,'' said Rep. William H. Gray III, D-Pa.,
a powerful black congressman who wrote legislation imposing
sanctions. He urged keeping those sanctions in place.
   ``It's good news, it's welcome news,'' Gray said. ``But the fact
is, South Africa remains a state that is not free.''
   ``I think progress has to be quick. And I think my father will
play a very specific role in bringing about peace in South
Africa,'' said another daughter, Boston University student Zenani
Mandela-Dlanini. ``He has to be there.''
   ``He will work together with the movement,'' she said. ``I am
positive about that.''
   But she said she was worried about the psychological effect of
his release after so long in prison, and about his safety.
   In Atlanta, Coretta Scott King, widow of slain U.S. civil rights
leader Martin Luther King Jr., said she was overjoyed by the
release of Mandela, ``who has shown us the tremendous power of
unearned suffering for a just cause.''
   ``I sincerely hope that the government and the anti-apartheid
movement will continue to embrace the non-violent spirit in their
negotiations as they seek a multi-racial democracy based on one
person, one vote,'' Mrs. King said in a statement.
   In Texas, a delegate to the African National Congress compared
Mandela's release to another event thought unthinkable just months
ago.
   ``This is like the Berlin Wall,'' Rick Marshall-Greene of San
Antonio told a rally at an Austin park attended by nearly 250
people. ``Nelson Mandela is that one brick, the first brick, that
is coming out and that will help dismantle that wall'' of apartheid.
   But Mario Marcel Salas, another ANC delegate living in San
Antonio, who like Marshall-Greene is barred from returning to his
homeland, said, ``Nelson Mandela has been released, but Nelson
Mandela is not free because Nelson Mandela cannot vote in the
country where he was born.''
   Whites joined blacks at a service at the New Hope Baptist Church
in Evansville, Ind.
   ``It was a great celebration. People danced in the aisles, and
we did our best to have a kindred spirit with the people of South
Africa,'' the Rev. W.R. Brown Jr. said.
   Church services also were held in San Francisco and a musical
celebration attracted 400 people to a park across the San Francisco
Bay in Oakland, Calif.
   At Rider College in Lawrenceville, N.J., Army Gen. Colin Powell,
the first black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
Mandela's release ``was the beginning of the end of apartheid.''
   Seattle's first black mayor, Norm Rice, declared Feb. 11 Nelson
Mandela Day. New York's first black mayor, David Dinkins, urged
Pretoria to fulfill other promises it made earlier this month to
replace ``current massive repression in South Africa with truly
free political association.''
   Hundreds of people danced and sang in the streets of New York
City's Harlem section in a spontaneous celebration, while hundreds
more crowded the House of the Lord Pentecostal Church in Brooklyn
for an exuberant service.
   They shouted and chanted as they watched Mandela begin his first
televised address, and raised their arms in a salute as he did when
he finished.
   On the side of the church's television, a sticker saying ``Free
Mandela'' had been cut and refigured to say ``Mandela Free.''
   In Cambridge, Mass., Patrick Lekota, a former political prisoner
who was jailed with Mandela, said he had mixed feelings watching
the release.
   ``In a way I was relieved. His release will bring stability to
the movement and strengthen it,'' Lekota said. ``But as I watched
him walk down the road, surrounded by police, I had a sudden fear
that anything could happen.''
   Ms. Mandela-Dlamini attended a church service Sunday night in
Boston.
   She did not speak, but her husband, Thumbuzini Dlamini, told the
congregation: ``Today is a very special day for us as members of
the Mandela family. A victory has been won by our people.''

<HEAD>Sharon Offers Resignation To Protest Gov't Policies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trade Minister Ariel Sharon, the chief
opponent of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir in the right-wing Likud
bloc, today offered his resignation from the Cabinet to protest
government policies he said endanger Israel.
   Sharon's surprise move came during a meeting at which he and
other hard-line members of the party were expected to challenge
Shamir's plan for elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   Sharon said he feared compromises would be made to end the
Palestinian uprising that would jeopardize Israel's right to keep
the occupied lands, which the Likud considers part of historic
Israel.
   ``I know and am convinced that there are other ways to quell
this terror,'' he said. ``We can make peace based on our historic
right to the Land of Israel.''
   ``I decided to resign from the government to continue my
struggle for reaching our national objectives which are now
endangered as a result of the government's policy,'' he said.
   As Sharon spoke, the more than 2,000 delegates to the Likud's
Central Committee meeting rose from their chairs and several
hundred began chanting ``Arik! Arik!'' Sharon's nickname.
   Shamir, who spoke after Sharon, received scattered boos as he
began his speech by saying he would consider his offer to resign.
   It was not clear what the immediate effect of Sharon's
announcement would be.
   Akiva Eldar, a political commentator for the daily Haaretz, said
on Israel television that Sharon may have made the move merely to
strengthen his position with the Central Committee.
   Sharon, who was defense minister during Israel's unpopular 1982
invasion of Lebanon, said he would resign only from the Cabinet,
not from his party post as head of the Central Committee.
   Before the meeting, opinion surveys in Israeli newspapers showed
Shamir was expected to easily overcome Sharon's challenge at the
party meeting. The prime minister said he wanted a clear decision
from the party's nearly 3,200 Central Committee members on his
peace moves.
   ``I don't see any reason for a compromise,'' Shamir said on
Israel radio.
   Shamir has threatened to resign unless he gets majority approval.
   His opponents, led by Sharon, want to vote on details of the
election plan in order to block possible compromises urged by the
United States as a way to start an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III has been pushing
since December for a Palestinian-Israeli dialogue to get the
stalled peace process rolling again, but his efforts have been
blocked by the Likud's squabbling over tactics.
   Shamir's plan, approved by the Cabinet last May amid
international pressure on Israel to quiet the uprising, calls for
electing Palestinians to negotiate a temporary peace with Israel.
Later talks would decide the final status of the West Bank and Gaza.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, meanwhile, a general strike was
declared in Gaza City following the death of a 15-year-old
Palestinian from wounds he suffered in a clash with Israeli
soldiers Sunday night, Arab reporters said.
   The army confirmed the death but said it was still investigating.
   The death raised to 656 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israeli soldiers or civilians in the 26-month uprising. Forty-three
Israelis have died, and 181 Palestinians who were killed by fellow
Arabs, most on suspicion of collaborating with Israeli authorities.

<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. said today it is in
preliminary talks to find a major investor or merger partner after
falling on hard times because of its criminal troubles and the
slumping junk-bond market.
   In a statement, Drexel said senior members of the firm had
concluded it should seek outside assistance.
   ``The unsettled markets, particularly in the high-yield area,
have adversely affected the liquidity of our parent corporation,
Drexel Burnham Lambert Group,'' Drexel said.
   The closely held Wall Street firm said the parent company had a
condolidated net worth of more than $800 million. It said the
securities business subsidiary, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
``continues to have good liquidity and has satisfactory excess
regulatory capital.''
   Drexel said it is ``taking appropriate action to maximize
liquidity,'' but did not elaborate.
   Drexel reported a loss of about $40 million for last year, in
which it pleaded guilty to six felonies and paid $650 million to
the federal government to settle wide-ranging securities fraud
charges and avoid a trial.
   The firm had been battered by the charges in the government's
lengthy investigation of Wall Street securities fraud. The probe
now focuses on the former head of Drexel's highly productive
high-yield ``junk bond'' division, Michael Milken, who is under
indictment.
   Back before Drexel's troubles mushroomed, Milken was reported to
reported to have received $550 million in total compensation in one
single year, 1987.
   Drexel also was hard hit by the collapse of the nation's $210
billion junk bond market last fall, following the collapse of a
takeover deal for United Airlines' parent, UAL Corp. The market has
yet to recover, and Drexel had to write down the value of its
junk-bond portfolio.
   Drexel, which pioneered the use of the high-yield, low-grade
securities, remains the leader of the junk-bond market and as such
has been hit harder than other Wall Street firms by the market's
slump.
   The firm has reduced its work force to about 5,300 employees
from a peak of 10,700. It also sold its retail brokerage business
last year.
   ``The past year has been an extraordinarily difficult one for us
and our employees,'' Drexel said in announcing the 1989 loss.
   Drexel had long been rumored on Wall Street to be in serious
financial difficulty and seeking an outside investor or partner.
   Such a move would conclude one of the most dramatic turnarounds
in Wall Street history. Drexel was the emblem of the high-flying,
takeover-driven 1980s and the firm made a profit of $522.5 million
on revenue of $5.3 billion in 1986.
   The firm earned more than $400 million in 1987 and reported a
loss of $166.7 million in 1988, which include a charge to cover the
$650 million payment to the government.

   Four robbers leaving a McDonald's after tying
up the manager were confronted by nine police officers early today,
resulting in a gun battle in which three thieves were killed and
one wounded, officials said.
   Elsewhere, a customer arriving at a McDonald's in Texas was
killed when a robber shot him in the back.
   None of the officers involved in the northern Los Angeles
shootout was injured.
   The gun battle occurred at about 1:30 a.m. in the neigborhood of
Sunland, 15 miles north of downtown, said police Lt. William Hall.
   The robbers had been followed by undercover officers
investigating a rash of McDonald's restaurant robberies, Hall said.
   Police said the restaurant was closed but the thieves broke in
and confronted the manager.
   ``There was a female manager inside all alone,'' Hall said.
``The doors were locked. We don't know how they got in, but she
didn't let them in. They tied her up and forced her to provide the
combination to the safe.''
   The unidentified manager wasn't hurt.
   The wounded bandit was taken to Holy Cross Hospital, where a
nursing supervisor wouldn't give a condition report.
   In Texas, a Houston teen-ager was fatally wounded late Saturday
when he and two friends interrupted a late-night robbery at a
McDonald's, authorities said. Leshon Reagins, 15, died Sunday.
   Police said Reagins and two friends entered the McDonald's and
one went to the restroom while Reagins and the other friend went to
the counter to order.
   But they found no one behind the counter or in the customer
seating areas. Police said that when Reagins' friend yelled for
service, a man armed with a pistol and wearing a mask emerged and
told the teen-agers to leave.
   While the two boys fled, the suspect fired one shot, hitting
Reagins in the back, said homicide Lt. Dale Atchetee.
   Three armed robbers had rounded up about 10 people, most of them
employees, and forced them to lie on the floor in the back of the
restaurant, police said. The bandits took an undetermined amount of
money and fled in a car driven by a fourth person, police said.

   Authorities today searched the Chicago area
for five convicts, including three murderers, who apparently cut
through two sets of bars and crossed a fence to escape from a
maximum-security state prison.
   A sixth escapee from the overcrowded Joliet Correctional Center
was recaptured in Chicago late Sunday, about 12 hours after the
break, state prison spokesman Nic Howell said.
   The inmates apparently cut through bars on their cells, broke a
window, cut through bars outside the window and crossed a fence to
get away _ all without being detected, Howell said.
   ``We're questioning inmates and security guards to find out if
this was a planned thing,'' he said. ``Obviously, this was a
serious breach of security. It may be a while before all our
questions are answered.''
   Howell said Tommy Munoz of Chicago was captured around 5:30 p.m.
by prison authorities who had staked out a cousin's house on the
southwest side of the city, some 60 miles east of the prison. Munoz
was returned to the prison, where he was serving a two-year
sentence for narcotics violations and intimidation, Howell said.
   ``One down, five to go,'' Howell said. ``We've got a bunch of
leads. We're checking out everything and anything that might be
worth counting.''
   The five others were believed to have headed to the Chicago area
because they also have ties there, Howell said.
   Munoz provided few clues to the escape, Howell said in a
telephone interview today. ``We've questioned him thoroughly and he
hasn't been very helpful at all,'' the spokesman said.
   State police, local law enforcement agencies and 100 corrections
officers specially trained to deal with escapes joined the search,
he said.
   Searches of the prison area with airplanes, helicopters and dogs
were called off late Sunday afternoon after officials determined
the escapees had split up, state Trooper Thomas Miller said.
   Howell said the men were last accounted for at 4:55 a.m. Sunday
and an inmate count did not come up short until 7 a.m.
   The men escaped from segregation cells, where they were kept
because of disciplinary problems, he said. Four of the men were
doubled up, two to a cell, and the other two each had his own cell.
   The prison houses 1,300 inmates, 500 more than it was built to
hold.
   The escapees still at large, whom Howell described as
``extremely dangerous,'' were identified as:
   _Daniel Johnson, 24, of Buru, Tenn., imprisoned for murder.
   _James F. Allen, 40, of Chicago, imprisoned for three murders.
   _Dave Rodriguez, 21, of Chicago, imprisoned for murder.
   _Terry W. Colburn, 21, of Bloomington, Ill., imprisoned for
burglary.
   _Ronald Roach, in his 20s, of Wyoming, Ill., imprisoned for
burglary.

<HEAD>Bank Fraud Trial Begins For Tennessee Congressman</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jury selection began today for the federal
bank fraud trial of U.S. Rep. Harold Ford, one of Tennessee's most
controversial and flamboyant politicians, and three co-defendants.
   Ford said he was optimistic when he arrived at the federal
courthouse for the trial, beginning almost three years after he was
indicted on 19 counts of conspiracy, bank and mail fraud.
   ``I feel like the day looks outside. It's beautiful,'' Ford
said, refusing to comment further.
   The congressman and his co-defendants are charged with
conspiring to funnel political payoffs to Ford through bogus loans
from lending institutions once run by former Tennessee bankers Jake
and C.H. Butcher Jr., both serving prison terms on other charges.
   The government says Ford drew more than $1 million in loans from
Butcher banks, though the amount of money the congressman allegedly
received is unclear since some loans outlined in the indictment
apparently were used to pay off others.
   Ford, a Democrat and Tennessee's first and only black member of
Congress, is credited with running a political machine that can
deliver the black vote in Memphis. He is accused of selling that
influence to the Butchers for their political and business gain.
   He has faced little or no opposition for his 9th Congressional
District seat since he was first elected to Congress in 1974.
   Ford, charged with conspiracy, bank and mail fraud, could be
sent to prison for up to 95 years if convicted on all 19 counts
against him
   The trial is expected to last as long as two months.
   The Butcher brothers once controlled a business empire that
included some 40 banks and savings and loans but both are now
serving 20-year prison sentences for bank fraud.
   C.H. Butcher Jr. has pleaded guilty to two counts in the Ford
indictment.
   Jake Butcher, who ran unsuccessfully for governor of Tennessee
in 1974 and 1978, was listed as an unindicted co-conspirator in the
Ford indictment.
   Ford has argued since his indictment that racism and politics
are behind his legal troubles, that he was indicted by a grand jury
in Knoxville rather than Memphis because eastern Tennessee is
heavily Republican and primarily white. Memphis, Ford's hometown,
is 50 percent black.
   Ford failed to carry that argument in pre-trial motions and the
6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati refused to consider
it before trial.
   The trial was moved to Memphis from Knoxville at Ford's request.
   Ford's co-defendants are accountant David Crabtree and lawyers
Douglas Beaty and Karl Schledwitz. They are all charged with bank
fraud and mail fraud conspiracy. In addition, Schledwitz and Beaty
face 15 counts of mail fraud and Crabtree is charged in four mail
fraud counts.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
today that U.S. differences with Moscow on troops and aircraft
still stand in the way of completing an arms limitation treaty this
year.
   Baker, opening an East-West ``Open Skies'' conference, said that
after his talks last week with Soviet leaders, other key issues are
closer to being resolved.
   But he criticized President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for rejecting a
proposal by President Bush that would give the United States an
edge of 30,000 troops over the Red Army in Europe.
   Gorbachev has proposed equal limits of 225,000 or 195,000
soldiers. Baker said that does not take into account the fact that
the Soviets could quickly expand their forces in a crisis while
American troops would be an ocean away.
   Baker also criticized the Soviets' resistance to imposing
ceilings on aircraft that Moscow claims have a defense role.
   This was ``hardly a step toward arms reduction,'' Baker said.
   Raising the prospect of an impasse, Baker said ``disagreements
over aircraft limits must not prevent us from signing a CFE
(Conventional Forces in Europe) sgreement this year.''
   Baker's appearance at the conference capped a week of
high-profile and apparently successful European diplomacy. He is
here sounding out NATO allies on how to shape an accord with Moscow
to withdraw a half-million U.S. and Soviet troops from the
continent.
   The United States and Soviet Union now stand on the brink of
treaties to slash their chemical weapons and long-range nuclear
missiles.
   If the talks with allies and a session today with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze pan out, the differences between
Bush and Gorbachev on troop cuts can be worked out.
   U.S. officials said Baker was ``neutral'' about Gorbachev's
approach, which he lauded last week in Moscow, and the allies took
no immediate stand.
   Other administration sources said the Bush administration had
not decided on a position among the State Department, Pentagon and
National Security Council.
   An agreement on a troop ceiling would set the stage for a treaty
later this year between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and
Warsaw Pact alliances to remove about 400,000 Soviet and 100,000
American soldiers from Europe.
   Bush proposed in his State of the Union speech on Jan. 31 a
ceiling of 225,000 U.S. and Soviet soldiers each on foreign soil in
Europe with no more than 195,000 in central Europe.
   Gorbachev countered at a Kremlin meeting with Baker that the
195,000 ceiling should apply from the Atlantic to the Ural
Mountains inside the Soviet Union. That would mean the 30,000
troops Bush wants to keep in Belgium, Britain, Greece, Italy, the
Netherlands, Spain or Turkey _ all NATO allies _ would be
withdrawn, or U.S. forces would be reduced in central Europe to
reach the lower figure.
   Otherwise, Gorbachev said he would accept the 225,000 ceiling
but without restrictions in central Europe.
   That could benefit the Soviets. Since most of their troops _
about 385,000 in East Germany alone _ are in Central Europe, the
Soviets would be able to keep 30,000 more soldiers in the central
region than the Bush plan allows.
   Baker told Gorbachev he could not give him an answer until he
consulted with the 15 NATO allies. The two-day Ottawa conference
already was scheduled to consider unarmed aerial surveillance and
other techniques for exchanging military data between NATO and
Warsaw Pact countries.
   The U.S. reply is unlikely to be announced before Baker's
departure for Washington on Tuesday night.
   The talks in Moscow paid off with an agreement that Bush and
Gorbachev would sign in Washington in June providing for the
destruction of all their chemical weapons in 10 years _ if all
other nations capable of making poison gas sign a treaty.
   That represents a Soviet concession. Bush wants the right to
retain 2 percent of the U.S. poison gas arsenal until all other
producers approve the treaty.
   Also, Shevardnadze withdrew a demand to limit all foreign forces
stationed in Europe to 300,000 or 350,000. That means the U.S.
allies could keep their troops in other Western countries even
after the United States met a treaty ceiling.
   On the strategic weapons front, meanwhile, Baker's trip cleared
up questions about exchanging data from missile tests and how to
identify which warplanes are carrying air-launched cruise missiles.
   An unexpected breakthrough was reached on sea-launched cruise
missiles.
   The two sides agreed there is no reliable way to keep track of
the weapon, which can be carried on submarines and aboard warships.
Therefore, they decided to keep it out of the treaty and make
separate statements about their arsenals.
   This removed a major roadblock to completing the treaty to
reduce long-range missiles by 30 percent to 50 percent in time for
Bush and Gorbachev to sign at their summit in Washington.
   Between his talks in Moscow and the East-West conference in
Ottawa, Baker detoured over the weekend to Bulgaria and Romania,
where he exhorted government leaders to hold free and fair
elections.

   Harold McCusker, a
schoolteacher who became prominent in Northern Ireland politics,
died in a hospital Monday after a 16-year battle with cancer, his
family announced. He was 50.
   McCusker was a member of the British Parliament for 16 years,
representing the Official Unionists, the mainstream Protestant
party in Northern Ireland. He was party deputy leader from 1982.
   The diminutive, bespectacled politician was an eloquent speaker
and campaigner for tougher measures against the Irish Republican
Army, which is fighting to rid Northern Ireland of British rule.
   Like most Northern Ireland Protestants, McCusker fervently
opposed the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement that gave the Irish Republic
a say in running the province.
   He served a four-day jail sentence in January 1987 for not
paying the annual $75 car tax in protest of the accord.
   But he later became critical of older colleagues for failing to
come up with an alternative to the Anglo-Irish pact, and
co-authored ``An End to Drift,'' an influential analysis of ways
out of the impasse.
   McCusker is survived by his wife, Jennifer, and sons, Moore,
James and Colin.

   Thousands of people remain in prison eight months
after China's army crushed the pro-democracy movement, and
authorities continue to carry out arrests, torture and executions,
a U.N. document alleged Monday.
   The allegations appear in reports included in the document given
the Human Rights Commission by U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar. The commission is to consider human rights in China
during its current six-week session, which began Jan. 29.
   A letter from the Chinese government that is part of the 29-page
document said authorities showed ``utmost tolerance and restraint
in the face of illegal demonstrations'' and described China's
actions as ``justified and legitimate.''
   Ambassador Li Luye, who signed the letter, said nearly 300
people were killed in the attack June 3-4 on Tiananmen Square,
including members of the armed forces, and ``besides ruffians, a
small number of onlookers were shot accidentally, which is
regrettable.'
   Some unofficial estimates put the number of unarmed civilians
killed by soldiers in the thousands.
   In August, a U.N. panel of experts instructed Perez de Cuellar
to ``transmit ... information provided by the government of China
and by other reliable sources'' to the Human Rights Commission.
   One reports in the document is from Amnesty International, the
human rights group based in London. Despite the lifting of martial
law Jan. 10, it said, China has not announced pardons for thousands
of people imprisoned for taking part in pro-democracy
demonstrations.
   ``There have been further arbitrary arrests, and prisoners
continue to be detained incommunicado without charge or trial,
imprisoned or executed after unfair trials,'' Amnesty said.
   Tens of thousands of people have been arrested since June, up to
10,000 of them in Beijing alone, the organization declared.
Official reports put the number of detainees throughout China at
about 10,000.
   Amnesty estimated at least 1,000 people were killed and
thousands injured when soldiers moved into Tiananmen Square.
   Another report, from the International Commission of Health
Professionals for Health and Human Rights, gave graphic details of
descriptions by witnesses of protestors being ``crushed by tanks
into paste'' during the June 4 massacre.
   A third private group, the International League for Human
Rights, accused China of the ``systematic terrorizing of much of
Beijing's population'' and ``purging'' of those considered
sympathetic to the pro-democracy movement.
   ``Chinese justifications of its actions are invalid,'' the
league said. It argued that the suppression flouted international
law, and thus was not the internal matter Beijing claimed.
   Luye, China's permanent representative to the United Nations,
accused ``a small number of Western countries'' of violating the
U.N. charter by interfering in domestic affairs.
   ``The so-called Tiananmen bloodbath is sheer fabrication,'' his
letter said. ``The Chinese government's actions to put an end to
the turmoil and quell the rebellion were justified and legitimate.''
   China is the first permanent member of the Security Council
referred to the Human Rights Commission for alleged abuses.
   Forty-three delegates from governments serve on the commission.
Its annual sessions are attended representatives of most other U.N.
member states and nearly 150 private human rights groups.

   Auto dealer Steve Tatone said Monday he will

Michael DeWine, who is running for lieutenant governor.
   Tatone, 34, will join Jack Schira, a retired Air Force officer
from Springfield, as Democratic candidates for the 7th
Congressional District seat. State Sen. David Hobson of Springfield
is the only announced Republican candidate.
   DeWine, a Republican from Cedarville, is running for lieutenant
governor on a ticket headed by former Cleveland Mayor George
Voinovich.
   Schira said the May 8 Democratic primary will be a ``doozy.''
   ``I feel he's going to bring big money into it. It's not clear
where he stands on the issues yet,'' Schira said.
   Tatone already has announced that he agreed to give up
management of one of his two dealerships.
   Tatone, who has four children, said one challenge for his
campaign will be to get voters to look at him as a political
candidate instead of a businessman.
   Tatone said his campaign intends to address the federal budget
deficit and the plight of the hungry and the homeless.

   An airliner with 39 people aboard
crashed after a failed takeoff attempt today and smashed into a car
near the airstrip, killing a woman and her young son, authorities
said.
   Most of the 36 passengers and three crew members suffered only
minor injuries.
   The Fokker twin-engine turboprop, which belonged to TAM Regional
Airlines, crashed at 9:40 a.m. as it tried to land in the
southeastern city of Bauru, 220 miles from Sao Paulo, TAM spokesman
Luiz Carlos Franco said.
   The plane failed to gain altitude as it tried to take off, said
Maria Dalva, head of the news department of Bauru's Auri Verde
radio station.
   ``As the plane came in for an emergency landing on an empty plot
of land near the airport it smashed into a station wagon, killing a
29-year-old woman and her 4-year-old-son,'' said Dr. Cesar
Carvalho, director of the Bauru Municipal Hospital.
   The plane also hit and damaged two unoccupied houses. Its wings
and engines burst into flames but the fuselage remained intact, Ms.
Dalva said. About 30 firemen and policemen quickly extinguished the
flames.
   Most of the passengers and crew members walked away from the
accident and only a few had to be carried on stretchers, she said.
   The pilot was in the hospital's intensive care unit with serious
injuries and the co-pilot had a fractured spine, Carvalh said. Some
passengers were released after being treated for minor scrapes and
bruises.

   If the roaring crowds and the
journalists go away, Nelson Mandela finally may have some time with
the wife and children who sustained him through 27 years in prison.
   Mandela, freed Sunday, appears to enjoy the spotlight and
remains devoted to the African National Congress and its battle
against white supremacy. He would rather talk about politics than
his feelings, but said his family was his source of strength during
the ``long and lonely years.''
   ``I have lost a great deal over these 27 years,'' he told
reporters Monday. ``It is not a nice feeling for a man to see his
family struggling without security, without the dignity of the head
of the family around.''
   In a speech Sunday night, Mandela said of his family: ``I am
convinced that your pain and suffering was far greater than my
own.''
   The black nationalist leader went to prison in 1962, four years
after marrying Winnie, his second wife.
   They have two grown daughters _ Zenani, who studies at Boston
University with her husband, Prince Thumbumuzi Dlamini of
Swaziland; and Zindzi, 29, an unmarried mother of three who lives
with Mrs. Mandela in Soweto, the huge black township outside
Johannesburg.
   Mandela also has a son, Makgatho, and a daughter, Makaziwe
Mandela-Amuah, by his 13-year first marriage, which ended in
divorce in 1957.
   Makgatho is a businessman in the Transkei tribal homeland in the
southeast, where his mother, Evelyn, lives in retirement from a
nursing career. Mrs. Mandela-Amuah lives with her husband and
children in the United States, where she studies at Amherst College
in Massachussetts.
   His wife and other relatives were with Mandela at his first news
conference, conducted on the lawn of Anglican Archbishop Desmond
Tutu's home while some of the 12 Mandela grandchildren splashed in
the swimming pool.
   The Mandelas stayed with Tutu on Sunday night, and after the
news conference flew to Johannesburg, where they hope to live in
the small house in Soweto they had shared for a few years.
   During the meeting with reporters, Mandela said he is not bitter
about his imprisonment. He even had kind words for his jailers, one
of whom was specifically assigned to look after him.
   ``They understand our point of view and tried to do everything
to make you as happy as possible,'' Mandela said. ``That has wiped
out any bitterness a man could have.''
   When things are quieter, Mandela said, he wants to visit Qunu,
the Transkei village where he was raised.
   ``I long to see the little stones on which I played as a child,
the rivers where I swam,'' said Mandela, whose father was a member
of the Tembu royal clan of the Xhosa tribe.
   He was unfazed by finding more than 100 journalists in Tutu's
gardens or by their dozens of questions, which he handled with
composure as Mrs. Mandela sat silently beside him, wearing a print
turban and white, floor-length dress.
   Mandela expressed humility about the huge outpouring of support
when he was freed. ``I am completely overwhelmed by the
enthusiasm,'' he said. ``I am unable to describe my emotions,'' he
said.
   Asked whether he had persuaded the government to make recent
concessions to blacks, Mandela declared: ``It would be most
presumptuous of me to think that I've had any influence on
government policy.''

   Until three years ago, a state legislator
from the Appalachian hills of eastern Kentucky says he never gave
much thought to AIDS, assuming his family and friends were immune
from a disease that he considered a big-city problem.
   State Rep. Paul Mason's sense of security ended abruptly when
his daughter, Belinda Mason, contracted the AIDS virus through a
blood transfusion in 1987.
   His daughter's plight spurred the used car salesman from
Whitesburg to action, putting him on the front lines of a fight to
promote AIDS education, prevent discrimination and curb the spread
of the disease.
   ``It really wasn't a part of my world,'' Mason said. ``You're
sitting in middle class America and AIDS is just not a part of your
world. Now it's something I live with every waking moment.''
   After learning of his daughter's affliction, Mason said, his
apathy turned to anger. He was bitter at the blood donor and health
care officials.
   ``You want to go after somebody with your bare hands,'' Mason
said. ``I'm not sure I'll ever be able to look at my daughter ...
and forgive him (blood donor). Nobody has a right to steal part of
me.''
   But Mason has learned to channel his emotions in another
direction. The 1988 General Assembly enacted his bill to make it
illegal to use blood for transfusions before the blood is tested
for AIDS contamination.
   This year, Mason introduced sweeping AIDS legislation to foster
a greater understanding of AIDS and to wipe out discrimination.
   ``When she contracted it there was a world of discrimination out
there and a lot in the health care field because everyone was
scared,'' he said. ``In the health care field, I have seen a world
of change in attitude.''
   Mason removed the proposal's two most controversial sections.
One would have allowed a murder charge to be brought against a
person who knowingly gives an uninformed sexual partner AIDS,
resulting in the partner's death. The second would have allowed the
state Cabinet for Human Resources to obtain court orders to detain
people infected with sexually transmitted diseases in hospitals.
   The bill still would require extensive education programs for
state and local agencies and mandatory AIDS training for health
professionals. It also would give AIDS patients the same legal
protections as handicapped people.
   Ms. Mason, 31, who was appointed by President Bush last year to
the National Commission on AIDS, said her father's bill symbolizes
the type of government action needed to assist AIDS patients.
   ``We have to stop relying on people's good manners and have some
solid legal guidelines on how to treat people'' infected with the
AIDS virus, she said.
   Mason said his bill stems from watching his daughter, who lives
in Hartford, Ky., fight discrimination.
   Ms. Mason said much of her father's bill ``came two years too
late for me,'' but is intended to protect other AIDS patients from
encountering the same hostility and hardships.
   ``What my dad has attempted to do is to make the road for people
who come after me easier,'' said Ms. Mason, who found out in
October that her infection has developed into AIDS.
   ``He wasn't doing it just for his child,'' but for the countless
others who have contracted the disease, she said.
   Ms. Mason said people suffering from the disease are engaged in
the same fight as blacks, women and other minority groups in
seeking to end discrimination.
   She is treated well when she visits home in Letcher County, in
the heart of Appalachia, her father said. But other AIDS victims
have encountered discrimination there, he said.
   One Letcher County man who is fighting AIDS has concealed his
ailment from friends and neighbors, telling them he's suffering
from another disease because he fears being ostracized, Mason said.
   ``That kind of points up the need for education and
dissemination of information,'' he said.

<HEAD>Poindexter Trial Off Two Weeks, Reagan Deposition on as Planned</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge today delayed the start of
John Poindexter's Iran-Contra trial by two weeks but said he will
proceed with plans to take former President Reagan's videotaped
deposition Friday in Los Angeles.
   U.S. District Judge Harold Greene said that ``hopefully''
Reagan's testimony can be taken in a courtroom of the federal
courthouse in Los Angeles.
   The judge rejected a suggestion by the ex-president's lawyers
that the deposition be taken in a building in Los Angeles where
Reagan has offices.
   One of Poindexter's lawyers, Richard Beckler, had urged Greene
to put off taking Reagan's testimony until the middle of the trial
after Iran-Contra prosecutors have presented their case.
   ``I am not going to buy that; we are going to proceed,'' said
Greene.
   Seven news organizations applied to the court for permission to
attend the videotaped deposition. They are Cable News Network,
Capital Cities-ABC Inc., CBS Inc., National Broadcasting Co., The
New York Times Co., Times Mirror Co. of Los Angeles and The
Washington Post.
   The judge said he will rule before Friday on their request, but
he said he was ``doubtful that the press could be there'' in view
of concerns over the possibility of disclosing classified
information during the deposition. Such material would be edited
out of the videotape before it is shown in court at Poindexter's
trial.
   Greene said he is delaying the start of the trial until March 5
to resolve a number of issues, including disagreement concerning
some 150 classified documents that Poindexter, a former national
security adviser to Reagan, wants to use at his trial.
   Regarding the disputes over classified material, the judge will
have to rule on whether the documents are necessary for the former
national security adviser to get a fair trial. If Greene rules that
they are necessary and if U.S. intelligence agencies refuse to
allow their declassification, the Poindexter trial could be placed
in jeopardy.
   As past Iran-Contra cases have shown it is not unusual to have
unresolved last-minute disputes over the use of classified
material. There were repeated disputes over the use of such
material before and during the trial of former National Security
Council staffer Oliver North.

   It's not a magic elixir that
builds strong souls and guarantees immunity from sin. But the milk
produced by the pope's dairy herd must certainly taste like heaven.
   Each morning, a truck with Vatican license plates delivers 120
cartons of the milk to three local coffee bars.
   Within hours, they're sold out.
   ``We don't have enough to meet the demand,'' said the waitress
at Mirko's Bar on Via Garibaldi who gives here name only as
Manuela. ``It sells like hot cakes.''
   Milk from holy cows?
   Actually, it comes from 30 black-and-white Holsteins on a small
farm inside the walled compound of the 17th century papal palace.
   Until recently, this thriving dairy operation was the
least-known of the public services offered by the Vatican, which
also runs a postal service and pharmacy in Vatican City in the
heart of Rome.
   The farm at Castel Gandolfo, the pope's hilltown holiday
residence, covers about 60 acres on the palace grounds and is
surrounded by pine, cypress and olive trees. In addition to milk,
the farm produces eggs, olive oil and other products for
distribution at the Vatican market, open only to Vatican employees
and their families.
   The farm has been operating since 1933, but the sale of milk to
the public began only six years ago.
   The cows produce 130 gallons of milk a day, most of which is
transported to the Vatican market, and the remaining 31 gallons to
the three cafes.
   Few people outside of Castel Gandolfo knew about the milk
operation until the Rome newspaper Il Messaggero recently published
an article entitled ``The Pope's Milk, How Tasty.''
   Since then, people have been traveling 15 miles from Rome to
sample the product at the two bars in Castel Gandolfo and one in
nearby Albano. The milk comes in distinctive yellow and white
cartons with the label ``Fattoria Ville Pontificie,'' meaning the
Pontifical Villa Farm.
   ``Our regular customers are getting upset because there's not
enough left for them any more,'' said Manuela, as she served up a
capuccino with steamed Vatican milk. ``They're asking us to put
aside cartons for them.''
   One client, Rita Grecco, said she is taking no chances.
   ``I buy two or three liters every day,'' she said. ``I used to
come in the afternoons, but now I have to come early every
morning.''
   The bar also receives 30 cartons of milk a day from another
supplier but usually manages to sell only five of them, Manuela
said. Price is not a factor. Both brands cost the same, about $1.10
dollars a liter.
   Even before its popularity reached outside the area, the locals
put their faith in the Vatican milk when they were looking for
products free of contamination following the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear
disaster.
   The milk was considered safe because the cows were kept inside
their barns and fed hay and fodder that had been stored in
protective silos, said Saviero Petrillo, director of the papal
village.
   ``There was a much greater demand, especially from mothers with
young children,'' he said. ``Today, in an era when there's a lot of
emphasis on ecology and the environment, people are more conscious
of products that are healthy and genuine.''
   Vatican services seem to have a special allure for Italians and
foreigners, who view the tiny city-state as a rock of efficiency in
a land often associated with confusion and chaos.
   Many post their mail at the Vatican, knowing they can cut days,
even weeks off the delivery time of a letter abroad. In 1988, the
Vatican post office helped give the city-state a $13 million
surplus.
   But does the Vatican's milk taste better than others? Some
customers swear it does.
   ``It's creamier,'' said Mrs. Grecco.
   Vatican officials avoid comparisons, although they stress the
cleanliness of the plant and the fact that the milk comes from a
single herd.
   ``We have no secret formula,'' said Giuseppe Bellapadrona, who
runs the farm. ``We just put the emphasis on quality.''

   U.S. sanctions against South Africa were
imposed in 1986 when Congress enacted them, along with specific
criteria for ending them, over then-President Reagan's veto.
   The sanctions would be lifted automatically if President Bush
reported to Congress that the South African government had:
   _ Freed African National Congress chief Nelson Mandela and all
other political prisoners.
   _ Repealed its declared state of emergency and freed all those
detained under it.
   _ Legalized democratic political parties and political activity
for all.
   _ Repealed the Group Areas Act and the Population Registration
Act, which restrict where non-whites can live and work.
   _ Agreed to enter into good-faith negotiations with
representative black leaders without preconditions.
   In addition, the president was empowered to suspend or modify
any of the sanctions 30 days after reporting to Congress that
Mandela and other prisoners had been freed, that three of the other
four conditions had been met and that the government had made
``substantial progress'' toward dismantling apartheid and setting
up a non-racial democracy.
   If Congress disagreed with the president's certification, it
could head off any change in the sanctions by passing a joint
resolution, which would then be subject to a presidential veto and
override fight if both sides chose a confrontation over the issue.
   The law set immediate goals of encouraging South Africa to lift
its declared state of emergency, free political prisoners, permit
free political activity and establish a timetable for ending
apartheid.
   It also called for establishment of democratic rule in the long
term but did not lay out criteria for judging how that goal was
being met.
   Among specific sanctions imposed were:
   _ A ban on the importation from South Africa of agricultural
products, textiles, uranium and uranium ore, iron, steel and coal.
   _ Prohibition of South African airlines from operating in the
United States, and barring of any U.S. airliner from taking off and
landing in South Africa.
   _ A ban on importation of articles made by South African
government-controlled organizations, with the exception of certain
strategic minerals.
   _ An end to new U.S. loans to South African businesses or to the
government, and an end to new U.S. private investments in South
Africa.
   _ The shutdown of U.S. oil exports to South Africa.

<DATELINE>HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A massive 2-inch-thick blanket
of crude oil spilled by the tanker American Trader moved ashore
today, invading a 2-mile stretch of beach near an environmentally
sensitive wildlife refuge.
   A 200-member cleanup crew was dispatched to the fouled beach
before dawn in an effort to mop up the black goo in what
authorities called the most serious beach pollution since the
400,000-gallon spill last Wednesday.
   ``We got hit with more oil overnight than we have in this whole
process. We got the biggest hit at Bolsa Chica State Beach,'' said
Tony Kozlowski, spokesman for the cleanup coordinators British
Petroleum, which chartered the tanker.
   The wildlife refuge, a wetlands area used by thousands of
migratory birds and by fish, lies behind the state beach. There are
not many migrating birds there this time of year, but officials
fear an invasion of oily water could foul the area for months.
   In addition to the 30-foot-wide, 2-inch-thick slick on Bolsa
Chica, the Coast Guard said smaller ribbons of oil 4-feet-wide were
reported near the Huntington Beach Pier.
   Cleanup activities at Bolsa Chica were suspended briefly when
workers began complaining of headaches and nausea from the oily
fumes. The workers were back on the beach by dawn.
   Meanwhile, there was still no decision on when the 811-foot
American Trader would be moved from its offshore mooring two miles
offshore to Long Beach Harbor for cargo unloading and repairs.
   Scuba divers applied temporary patches to two holes in the
punctured hull Sunday and authorities said the vessel passed
``watertight integrity'' tests, said Coast Guard Petty Officer 3rd
Class Kristine Johnson.
   However, the vessel cannot be moved until it passes inspection
for cleanliness and other pollution standards, she said. She
estimated that the vessel could be moved no earlier than Tuesday,
but other officials said an attempt to dock it could be made later
today.
   Plans called for moving the vessel into an Arco dock to deliver
the remainder of the cargo and to make permanent repairs, Coast
Guard Capt. Jim Card said Sunday.
   Cleanup crews reported that the oil slick that coated 14 miles
of shore with gooey muck was shrinking. One-third of the Alaskan
crude still menaced the coast, staining sand as far north as Long
Beach.
   Before today's oily onslaught, Coast Guard Chief Warrant Officer
Rick Meidt described the cleanup as ``impressive,'' but cautioned,
``It's too soon to declare a victory _ there's 131,000 gallons of
oil in the water.''
   The American Trader's fouled No. 1 tank was to be cleaned before
the Coast Guard gave clearance for the ship to dock for cargo
delivery and permanent repairs.
   ``The tanks must be clean. You don't want it to be like a snail,
leaving a trail of oil,'' said Coast Guard Petty Officer 2nd Class
Dennis Hall.
   On Sunday morning, divers temporarily repaired the hull of the
tanker using prefabricated steel, plywood and water-resistant foam,
Kozlowski said.
   The oil leaked from the vessel Wednesday after it apparently
punctured itself twice on its own anchor while mooring in shallow
water at an offshore oil pipeline.
   The accident remained under investigation. The Coast Guard said
drug and alcohol tests on the ship's officers, including Capt.
Robert Laware, were negative.
   National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration data
showed 23 percent of the spilled crude had been skimmed or picked
up at sea as an oil-water mixture while 43 percent had evaporated
or naturally dissipated.
   The unrecovered 34 percent had spread out on the water as a thin
sheen and was nearly impossible to retrieve, Meidt said.
   ``We've reached the point where skimming is of limited value,''
Meidt said, though skimming will continue for several more days in
areas where the slick appears most concentrated.
   On the beaches, 415 cleanup workers were assembled by British
Petroleum. Kozlowski couldn't say how long they'd be there.
   The state Department of Fish and Game reported 48 birds have
been killed; British Petroleum officials put the number at 44 and
said 126 birds were under care after cleaning.
   Two dead, oil-soaked seals and one sea lion also were recovered,
but it wasn't known if their deaths were linked to the oil spill,
Fish and Game officials said.
   Calm seas and light breezes continue to help the cleanup effort.
   ``We've been blessed with good weather in this whole process,
but rain or high wind or choppy water could cause problems,''
Kozlowski said. ``We've had 3-foot ribbons of oil on some beaches.
A huge wind could bring a considerable amount on shore.''

   About 150 black students ended a five-day
sit-in today at Selma High School today, then briefly joined a
demonstration at City Hall, all part of a racial protest that shut
down all schools in this landmark city of the civil rights movement.
   The protesters paraded about a mile, carrying a banner that said
``Keep The Dream Alive,'' to the City Hall where they packed the
corridors. A few adults took part along with the students.
   Before their arrival, all City Hall offices were open, with only
a handful of protesters in sight. When the students jammed inside,
however, all offices closed, except for Mayor Joe Smitherman's. He
remained, with several police guarding his door.
   By noon, all but about 25 adult and student protesters were gone
from City Hall, and offices reopened.
   Smitherman, the same man who was mayor during the historic 1965
Selma-to-Montgomery civil rights march, met for less than an hour
with six student leaders and two attorneys, state Sen. Hank Sanders
and Yusef Salaam, both of Selma. The meeting ended without any sign
of progress.
   ``He's not satisfied us. There was double-talking going on,''
said one of the students, Malika Sanders, a daughter of the state
senator.
   The 150 sit-in protesters had left the high school after meeting
with Sanders, a protest leader, and School Superintendent Norward
Roussell. The students chanted ``Do the right thing'' as they
marched.
   The departure of the protesters from the high school came as
city leaders awaited a federal judge's decision today on whether to
order an end to the protests.
   Smitherman had asked U.S. District Judge Charles Butler of
Mobile for a court order and city attorney Henry Pitts had said he
expected the request to be granted. The request was filed before
the school building was vacated.
   Miss Sanders said the protests would continue. ``If we can sit
in at Selma High School five days, we can sit here just as long,''
she said upon arriving at City Hall.
   She and another black student at Selma High School, Latima
Salaam, said they ended the school sit-in not because of the threat
of a federal court order but because they feared Roussell would be
fired immediately.
   ``He's our leader. He felt it was in our best interest to leave.
Plus, the school board would fire him if we didn't leave,'' said
Ms. Salaam.
   The turmoil began when six white members of the city school
board voted Feb. 2 to dismiss Roussell, the city's first black
superintendent. The vote sparked protests leading to the closing of
two schools Tuesday and all 11 of Selma's public schools Wednesday.
   Roussell was reinstated after initial protests. But students and
other protesters want the school board to extend his contract,
which expires June 30.
   Ms. Salaam said Roussell assured them that they would not be
expelled for their occupation of the high school, but he did not
rule out lesser disciplinary action. She also said he agreed to
meet two student demands _ to allow them to wear African medallions
to class and to offer Afro-American history classes.
   Roussell said no decision had been made on whether schools will
reopen Tuesday.
   Black protesters, most of them students, took over the school's
cafeteria Wednesday as rising racial tensions forced the closing of
all 11 public schools in Selma's 6,000-student, 70 percent black
system.
   Smitherman said the only alternative to the court order was
turning the schools over to state control until the dispute can be
resolved.
   ``Both black and white students are suffering at this point,''
he said. ``They are trying to force us to make mass arrests.''
   Protest leaders at a Sunday night meeting warned of possible
economic boycotts, and instructed the students holding the sit-in
at the high school not to resist if police attempted to remove them
by force.
   Sanders told the crowd of 400 people gathered at the mostly
black First Baptist Church that boycotts of businesses were a
possible response to a court order.
   ``I heard a rumor that once an injunction was issued there was
going to be an economic boycott that was going to shut Selma
down,'' said Sanders, who declined to elaborate following the
meeting.
   Roussell told the crowd that he had refused a second time to
sign an affidavit that was to be used to obtain the injunction.
   Roussell said he could be fired again for refusing to sign, but
``I'm not going to leave.''
   On Saturday, protest leaders and the Rev. Joseph Lowery,
president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, met with
Smitherman and U.S. Justice Department representatives.

   Every dog has its day, and a Tokyo retailer is
hoping that day is Valentine's Day.
   The Tokyu Department Store is going all out this year to make
sure its pet-owning customers have a vast array chocolates,
cookies, fish sausages and other drool-inducing delicacies to
choose from.
   ``I'm buying chocolates for my boyfriend, so why not for my
dog?'' said Ayako Endo, a 22-year-old office worker.
   Miss Endo said buying a $3.50 gift set of goodies was the least
she could do for her 12-year-old English setter.
   ``They're good,'' she said. ``I eat them too.''
   As in the United States, Japanese celebrate Valentine's Day by
giving sweets to a loved one. Tokyu is hoping to expand the concept
a bit to include animals.
   ``We've been selling the chocolates for about three years, but
this is the first year we have gone all out,'' said Tokyu pet shop
clerk Yoshiko Kashiwazaki, pointing to a large table covered with
heart-shaped gift sets wrapped in red-and-yellow ribbons.
   A poster showed two furry creatures cuddled up over the slogan:
``For Lovers, Sweet Valentine.''
   ``I love you only,'' said one. ``Me too,'' replied the other.
   Shoppers are eating up the idea.
   ``I just love cats and dogs,'' said 12-year-old Yuki Kuwahara,
who bought a chocolate and chew-bone gift for a Maltese dog she's
rather fond of. ``We don't have a pet of our own.''
   Most of the customers who purchase sweets for their dogs are
women in their 30s or 40s, Kashiwazaki said.
   The chocolates come in both the regular brown and milky white
colors, ``contain 13 different vitamins and are made with only the
purest milk,'' according to Morinyu Pet Foods, the company that
makes them.
   Morinyu, a subsidiary of the huge Morinaga Milk Industry Co.,
Ltd., began producing the chocolates six years ago, intending them
to be used as rewards given to show dogs during training.
   But Tokyu, which sells a variety of gourmet pet foods, decided
to open the pet Valentine corner because sales of the chocolates
had increased each year in mid-February, Kashiwazaki said.
   ``As far as I know we're the only department store doing this,''
said Masataka Tajima of Tokyu's Sales Promotions Department.
   Hundreds of thousands of chocolates are sold for Valentine's Day
in Japan each year. The chocolates are given by women to men, who
often return the favor on March 14, which is known as ``White
Chocolate Day.''

<HEAD>Coast Guard Monitors Face Interrogation As Hazelwood Tries to

<TEXT>
   A Coast Guard monitor on duty the night
of the Exxon Valdez disaster testified today he could not have
ordered the ship to change course even if he had seen it was headed
for a rocky reef.
   Gordon Taylor said it would have taken the authority of a higher
Coast Guard officer to order Joseph Hazelwood to make a course
change.
   However, Taylor said the matter never became an issue because
the Exxon Valdez vanished from his radar screen shortly before the
accident.
   Taylor said he struggled to adjust the radar but could not bring
the ship back into his viewing range.
   ``So when you left, it was off the screen, and you didn't see it
anymore?'' asked Hazelwood attorney Dick Madson.
   ``That's correct,'' said Taylor, who went off duty at 11:45 p.m.
on March 23.
   He said he notified the monitor who took over for him that the
vessel was outbound but had disappeared from the radar.
   Madson has maintained that Taylor and Bruce Blandford, the
monitor who replaced Taylor at the Coast Guard's Vessel Traffic
System on the night of the Exxon Valdez disaster, were not watching
the radar screen.
   Madson says if they had alerted Hazelwood that his ship was
moving perilously close to jagged Bligh Reef, the accident never
would have happened.
   Scoring a key legal point, Madson won permission to raise the
Coast Guard responsiblity issue after Superior Court Judge Karl
Johnstone initially vetoed the tactic. Johnstone reversed himself
after considering case law on the issue.
   But the lawyer was barred from exploring another matter _
whether Taylor and Blandford were using drugs or alcohol on March
24 when the accident happened. Blood and urine tests administered
between 15 hours and three days after the grounding showed that
Blandford had a blood-alcohol level more than twice the legal limit
for driving and Taylor showed a small quantity of marijuana in his
system.
   Johnstone called the marijuana issue ``a red herring'' but said
he would reconsider admitting the alcohol test if Madson can show
its relevance. Blandford's alcohol reading of .203 was recorded 15
hours after the Exxon Valdez went aground in scenic Prince William
Sound.
   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., is being tried on a felony
charge of second-degree criminal mischief and misdemeanor charges
of reckless endangerment, negligent discharge of oil and operating
a vessel while intoxicated. The maximum penalty for conviction on
all counts is seven years, three months in prison and $61,000 in
fines.
   Prosecution witnesses have said Hazelwood spent much of the day
before the accident drinking vodka at a bar in the port town of
Valdez. But his shipmates said Hazelwood didn't appear drunk and
appeared in command of his ship.
   The 987-foot tanker, which ripped open on the rocky reef,
spilled nearly 11 million gallons of Alaska crude oil, killing
thousands of birds and other wildlife and blackening hundreds of
miles of rocky coast. Exxon says the cleanup has cost $2 billion so
far.

<HEAD>Bush Praises Scouts for `Lessons That Last s Lifetime'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush praised the Boy Scouts on
Monday for teaching ``lessons that last a lifetime'' at a White
House ceremony honoring scouting's 80th anniversary.
   Bush was presented the National Boy Scouts Organization's
highest award, the Silver Buffalo medallion _ a miniature buffalo
on a red, white and blue ribbon _ and wore it around his neck
during his brief remarks.
   The president said he was observing a tradition ``that dates all
the way back to 1910, when President Taft received the first Boy
Scout delegation right here in the White House.''
   ``Scouting is more than learning how to build a campfire or tie
a knot,'' Bush told a group of scouts and their leaders.
   ``Scouting teaches a love of outdoors and appreciation of our
environment; it teaches the spirit of serving others and self
respect. And let me make it pure and simple: It teaches lessons
that last a lifetime.''
   Bush was given the Silver Buffalo medallion as well as the first
copy of the new edition of the Boy Scout Handbook, which scout
leaders said is second only to the Bible in terms of copies printed.
   The president, in turn, used the ceremony to announce that he
was bestowing his daily ``point of light'' citation on the Montana
Council of the Boy Scouts for an environmental clean-up project
called ``Good Turn.''
   ``In the past five years, Project Good Turn has collected over
5,000 tons of trash from all across Montana and involved more than
30,000 young people in the cleanup effort,'' Bush said.
   Bush announces the award each day to an organization or
individual that illustrates his ``thousand points of light'' theme
of volunteerism and community service.
   Recipients get a letter from the president. Monday's was his
65th Point of Light award.

   Issues ranging from rudder control designs to
the effects of airline mergers on safety are expected to come up in
a hearing opening Tuesday into last fall's crash in New York of
USAir Flight 5050.
   National Transportation Safety Board Chairman James L. Kolstad,
who will conduct the four-day hearing in New York, said
crewmembers, airline officials, Federal Aviation Administration
experts and representatives of the Boeing Co. are expected to
testify.
   Two people were killed and 61 others were saved in a massive
rescue operation after the Boeing 737 airliner skidded off the end
of a LaGuardia Airport runway and into the East River, breaking
into pieces in an aborted takeoff.
   The crash has raised several safety issues and drawn attention
to more than a dozen reports of problems with rudder controls on
Boeing 737s.
   Kolstad said in a recent interview that the engineering and
mechancial design of the rudder trim on Boeing 737s will be among
issues taken up at the hearing. Investigators found that Flight
5050's rudder was improperly trimmed to full left although cockpit
recorders indicated pilots had properly checked the rudder's
position for takeoff.
   Pilot Michael Martin reported the plane was drifting to the left
before he aborted the takeoff, which was being handled by co-pilot
Constantine Kleissas.
   The plane was scheduled to fly to Charlotte, N.C.
   ``We feel the rudder trim system is what actually precipitated
the USAir accident,'' Air Line Pilots Association representative
Tom Kraemer said Monday. The pilots' union and other interested
groups will participate in the hearing.
   Other matters to be explored during the hearing include cockpit
crew training and crew coordination by USAir, its flight operations
and the recent merger of USAir with Piedmont and its ``impact on
flight operations,'' Kolstad said.
   The plane's co-pilot came to USAir in the merger. Kleissas was
controlling takeoff of a 737 for the first time since training for
the airliner.
   The safety board chairman said the hearing also will cover FAA
surveillance of USAir operations and runway design, including
whether it is advisable to install arresting gear at the ends of
runways along with ramps for crash and fire rescue equipment.
   Finally, the hearing will cover FAA drug and alcohol rules, he
said. The FAA suspended the flying certificates of the plane's
pilot and co-pilot two days after the crash, citing their failure
to appear immediately for drug and alcohol tests after the crash.
   Drug tests taken 44 hours after the crash showed no trace of
illegal substances in either man.
   The safety board examines all aviation crashes, determines their
probable cause and makes recommendations to airlines,
manufacturers, Congress and the FAA for improving safety. The board
has no regulatory power.

   The capital of the Soviet Asian republic of
Tadzhikistan erupted in rioting today, with mobs angry over rumors
that Armenian refugees were getting preferential treatment,
official sources said. There were deaths and dozens of injuries
reported.
   The government imposed a state of emergency and a 10 p.m. to 6
a.m. curfew in the city of Dushanbe to quell ``mass disorders and
pogroms, and acts of arson and looting,'' the official Tass news
agency said.
   Armored vehicles were brought into the city center, which was
calm late today, said Musafar Madzhidov, correspondent for official
radio and TV in Dushanbe. He said an unknown number of people had
been killed and more than 70 injured.
   Rioting erupted after two rallies in a 24-hour period over
rumors that Armenian refugees from bloody ethnic strife in the
Caucasus region were being given preference for new housing,
Madzhidov said in a telephone interview.
   Members of the crowd shouted, ``Down with the Armenians!'' he
said.
   Armenians, a predominantly Christian people, have been involved
for the past two years in a bloody dispute with predominantly
Moslem Azerbaijanis over control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region of
Azerbaijan.
   More than 200 people have been killed in Armenian and Azerbaijan
since Jan. 13, and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was forced to
send thousands of soldiers into the southern region to impose
control.
   But until today there had been no reports that the trouble had
spread to the predominantly Moslem republics of Soviet Central Asia
like Tadzhikistan.
   The Tadzhikistan Communist Party leader, Kakhar Makhkamov,
appeared before a crowd that gathered Sunday outside party
headquarters in Dushanbe and asked for 24 hours to investigate the
rumors, Madzhidov said.
   Another crowd gathered today, but ignored his report that all
but one Armenian refugee already had left Dushanbe, he said.
   They pelted the party headquarters with stones, breaking all the
windows, and then went on a rampage through shops located nearby,
he said.
   Police fired in the air to disperse the crowd, but the rioting
continued until armored vehicles brought soldiers at about 10 p.m.,
when the curfew was imposed, Madzhidov said. He did not know
exactly how the casualties occurred.
   There were no reports that the violence had spread from the city
of a half-million people to other parts of the republic, he said.
   Residents of Dushanbe reached by phone corroborated Madzhidov's
report, but said there had been rioting in suburbs of the capital
as well.
   Tass said Tadzhikistan Interior Minister M. Navzhuvanov had been
appointed military commandant of the city. It did not give any
other details of the unrest.
   Families in Tadzhikistan, a small mountainous republic bordering
China and Afghanistan, traditionally are large, and there is a
critical shortage of housing.

<TEXT>
   Operators of an Indian casino say
they will continue to offer Las Vegas-style gambling, despite a
warning from the state's attorney general that such games are
illegal.
   Leaders of the Lac du Flambeau Chippewa tribe say the opinion by
Attorney General Donald Hanaway does not make sense in a state
where a lottery and pari-mutuel betting at dog tracks are legal.
   It also threatens the economic revival of the 2,276-member
reservation, which recently invested $134,000 to remodel a grocery
store into the Lake of the Torches Casino in northern Wisconsin.
   Vilas County District Attorney David Penn said he will use
Hanaway's opinion to raid the year-old facility this week and shut
it down.
   ``I think the tribe realizes it is the law and it will be
enforced in Vilas County,'' Penn said.
   But tribal officials said the casino, which provides 18 jobs and
grossed $43,000 last month, would not close voluntarily.
   ``I will tell you right now, it will hurt us economically. It
will hurt us quite a bit,'' said Tribal Chairman Michael Allen last
week.
   Hanaway ruled Feb. 5 that the state's gambling laws, enacted in
1987, only allow bingo, lottery and pari-mutuel betting. Casino
games such as blackjack, poker, craps, roulette and video gambling
machines are illegal, he said.
   His opinion leaves enforcement to district attorneys in the
state's 72 counties. Any attempt to enforce his opinion is likely
to lead to a court challenge, observers said.
   In the last year, three Indian tribes in Wisconsin have opened
casinos: the Lac du Flambeau Chippewa, the Lac Court Oreilles
Chippewa and the Menominee.
   State officials can regulate gambling on the two Chippewa
reservations but have no enforcement authority on the Menominee
reservation, which falls under federal regulation, officials said.
   The Lac Court Oreilles Chippewa tribe, about 100 miles to the
west, also plans to keep its casino open. Tom Van Roy, district
attorney for Sawyer County, declined comment Monday when asked
whether he planned to try to shut down the casino in his county.
   The Lac du Flambeau's casino, open Wednesday through Sunday,
offers seven blackjack tables with $50 betting limits and some 40
video gambling machines, including blackjack, poker, horse races, a
lottery, and an electronic slot machine. There is also a bingo
parlor.
   Tribal Gaming Manager Jerry Maulson said the tribe invested
$134,000 to remodel the building and buy the equipment. ``We know
we aren't Las Vegas, but we wanted to make it look like that
atmosphere,'' he said.
   The casino grossed $43,000 in January, about enough to pay the
expenses, Maulson said, adding the venture can't survive without
non-Indian players.
   Maulson said he fears non-Indians living near the reservation
are staying away because of opposition to the tribe's spearfishing,
hunting and timber cutting rights guaranteed by 19th century
treaties.
   But players who showed up at the casino last Wednesday night
were enthusiastic and unfazed by Hanaway's ruling.
   ``We go to Las Vegas twice a year. This is almost like Vegas but
you don't have the glitter and the show. It is good
entertainment,'' said Bob Hansen, of nearby Minocqua.
   Patrons Bob and Carol Peglow said they used to drive to a
reservation in Watersmeet, Mich., before the Lake of the Torches
Casino opened. Hanaway's ruling did not make sense to them, they
said.
   ``You got a lottery, dog races. To me gambling is gambling,''
Chuck Peglow said, as he shuffled $1 chips back and forth a
blackjack table.

   The nuclear submarine Tennessee
successfully launched two Trident 2 missiles just 20 seconds apart
Monday, ending the Navy's three-year test program for the weapons.
   The two 44-foot missiles were launched as the Tennessee cruised
submerged in the Atlantic 200 miles off the Florida coast. The Navy
reported both firings were successful, running the missile's string
of successes to seven straight.
   The first shot officially ended the test program; the second
qualified the Tennessee to become the first submarine to go on
operational patrol with 24 of the nuclear-tipped missiles.
   The Navy says the Trident 2, priced at $26.5 million each, is
much more accurate than its undersea predecessors, Polaris,
Poseidon and Trident 1. Published reports said the weapon's
warheads can strike within 400 feet of their targets, compared with
about 1,500 feet for the Trident 1.
   The first launch Monday marked the final test flight for the
Trident 2, completing a program which began in January 1987 with a
series of 19 launches from land, 15 of them successful. Nine
submarine tests followed, all from the Tennessee and seven of them
successful.
   The second launch was called a ``demonstration and shakedown
operation,'' or DASO which mainly tested the sub crew's ability to
safely handle and launch the missile. Navy spokeswoman Pat Hicks
said after each DASO is completed, a submarine is certified for
deployment.
   The Tennessee is scheduled to go on operational patrol in March
with 24 Trident 2s, each capable of delivering up to 12 nuclear
warheads to targets more than 4,600 miles away.
   Current Navy plans are to deploy a total of 24 Trident 2 subs.
The Pennsylvania is scheduled to arrive soon for its DASO test.

   The Soviet leadership today called for an
extraordinary session of the national Congress to strengthen
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's powers as president.
   The official Tass news agency said the presidium of the Supreme
Soviet, the nation's highest executive body, ``unanimously favored
the establishment of democratic presidential power in our country.''
   Such a move, coming on the heels of a key Communist Party
Central Committee meeting at which party leaders agreed to
surrender their monopoly on power, would further strengthen the
government while weakening the power of the party apparatus.
   Tass said the presidium, headed by Gorbachev, would ask the
Supreme Soviet parliament to call its parent body, the 2,250-member
Congress of People's Deputies, into session in the near future, but
did not give a date. The Supreme Soviet goes into session Wednesday.
   All constitutional questions, such as powers of the presidency,
must be decided by the Congress, which meets briefly twice a year.
   The presidium said it made its decision because of the debate
going on in Soviet society about the role of the Communist Party
and political reforms.
   Government leaders want the Congress also to discuss issues
concerning the Soviet political system, property and strengthening
the Soviet government, Tass said, without giving further details of
those issues.

<TEXT>
   Top U.S. and Soviet trade officials began
negotiations Monday aimed at wiping away nearly a half-century of
trade frictions between the two superpowers by the time of the
Bush-Gorbachev summit in June.
   Both sides expressed optimism that a new trade treaty could be
completed by then even though the complexity of the talks was
highlighted by the size of the delegations and the length of the
negotiating agenda.
   The U.S. team, led by Trade Representative Carla Hills and her
deputy, Julius L. Katz, included 19 officials from six agencies
including the departments of State, Treasury, Commerce and Labor.
   The first round of negotiations, which were scheduled to last
through Tuesday, were to be followed by two more sessions in late
February and early March. The Monday session included morning and
afternoon meetings separated by a working lunch.
   U.S. officials said they hoped that all of the negotiations
would be completed by the end of April to provide time to draft the
final trade agreement so that it can be signed by President Bush
and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev at their June meeting in
Washington.
   As the talks got under way, Hills told reporters that she was
confident that the differences separating the two sides could be
ironed out. Noting her Soviet counterparts, she said, ``We are a
very efficient team.''
   Yuriy N. Chumakov, deputy minister of foreign economic affairs
and the leader of the Soviet delegation, urged reporters to hold
their questions about the chances for success until negotiators had
finished the initial round of talks.
   Hills listed as goals ``normalizing trade relations with the
Soviet Union and facilitating trade between the two countries.''
   The administration hopes that normalized trade will give a boost
to the Soviet economy and provide economic support to the political
reforms being undertaken by Gorbachev.
   The trade treaty would be used to grant the Soviet Union ``most
favored nation status,'' qualifying it for the lowest tariffs
granted to any other country.
   The Soviets are anxious to obtain this benefit since their
imports to the United States must currently bear duties as much as
10 times higher than imports from other nations.
   The higher tariffs are a result of a 1974 law known as the
Jackson-Vanik amendment, which was passed by Congress in
retaliation for the refusal of the Soviet government to allow
Soviet Jews and other dissidents to leave the country.
   Bush has said he will ask Congress to waive the Jackson-Vanik
restrictions once the Soviet legislature passes a law spelling out
its new liberalized emigration policies. The new trade treaty would
be needed to put the lower tariffs into effect.
   Hungary recently obtained a waiver from the high Jackson-Vanik
tariffs. In addition to the Soviet Union, the administration is
also considering granting waivers for Czechoslovakia, Romania,
Bulgaria and East Germany. The curbs against Poland were lifted in
1987.
   One of the issues in the Soviet negotiations will be how the
waiver from the high tariffs will be accomplished. The
administration would like to negotiate a three-year trade agreement
with annual presidential review and waiver of the high tariffs.
   The Soviets would like to see the tariffs removed permanently as
a way of building confidence among business leaders that trade
relations will remain stable in coming years.
   But Congress, which is following the present negotiations with
keen interest, is unlikely to go along with more than a one-year
waiver.
   Other issues on the opening agenda were U.S. demands for
protection of American-patented products from piracy, an
arbitration method to settle business disputes and provisions to
allow either country to impose temporary trade restrictions if a
domestic industry suffers injury because of an unexpected surge of
imports.
   The administration is predicting that two-way trade between the
two countries could double or even triple over the next three years
with a new trade agreement, although private economists doubt that
assessment, given the numerous troubles plaguing the Soviet economy.
   Through November, the United States had sold $3.82 billion worth
of exports to the Soviets, primarily farm products, while importing
a relatively small $658 million worth of Soviet products, primarily
oil, platinum and consumer goods such as vodka and furs.
   Trade relations between the United States and the Soviet Union
began deteriorating with the onset of Cold War tensions following
World War II. In 1947, President Truman placed restrictions on U.S.
exports to the Soviet Union in an effort to keep military-useful
technologies from falling into communist hands.

<HEAD>Cellist Asks Government to Apologize to Solzhenitsyn</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Cellist and conductor Mstislav Rostropovich, in
his homeland for the first time in 16 years, said Monday the
government should drop treason charges against Alexander
Solzhenitsyn and apologize to the exiled author.
   ``It is ridiculous that a charge like this continues to loom
over him,'' Rostropovich told a news conference the day after
returning to the Soviet Union for concerts in Moscow and Leningrad.
   Rostropovich and his wife, singer Galina Vishnevskaya, were
stripped of citizenship in 1978, four years after they were hounded
into leaving the Soviet Union for giving refuge to Solzhenitsyn.
   Ms. Vishnevskaya had spent 30 years with the Bolshoi Theater
opera company and her husband gained international renown as a
cello soloist and conductor with the Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra.
He has conducted the National Symphony Orchestra of Washington,
D.C. for 13 years.
   In January, the Supreme Soviet legislalature restored their
citizenship and nullified an edict stripping them of all honors and
medals.
   When asked about the possible return of Solzhenitsyn to the
Soviet Union, Rostropovich said the writer hoped to do so, but not
until censorship of his work was completely lifted.
   ``I think that Alexander Solzhenitsyn will come back, but the
Soviet Union must apologize for the absurd charge of high
treason,'' he said.
   Failure to repeal the charge, which carries the death penalty,
runs counter to the liberalization occurring Soviet Union,
Rostropovich told reporters.
   Citizenship has been restored to several prominent cultural
figures who lost it under previous regimes, and they have returned
during the cultural thaw that prevails under President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   Solzhenitsyn, who depicted the horrors of Josef Stalin's prison
camps in ``The Gulag Archipelago,'' was formally charged with high
treason in 1974, stripped of citizenship and expelled. Rostropovich
and his wife followed their friend a few months later.
   Soviet officials have said Solzhenitsyn's citizenship could be
restored, but only if he formally asks for it. They say no request
has been received from the author, who lives in Vermont.
   Rostropovich, 62, said he and Ms. Vishnevskaya had found their
return a bittersweet and emotional experience.
   ``It is a strange feeling to be back in my own country,'' she
said. ``Our reception was warm and affectionate, but many friends
have passed away. It was very emotional.''
   ``We left here insulted,'' Rostropovich said. Then,
sarcastically, he said the order depriving them of citizenship was
``signed by Brezhnev,'' referring to the late President Leonid I.
Brezhnev, ``who did not do any damage to the Soviet Union, of
course.''
   Brezhnev now is villified as a leader who brought economic and
political stagnation during 18 years in power.
   Mrs. Vishnevskaya said she and her husband thought they never
would return.
   ``We were thrown out of our own house,'' she said, but now ``the
government has recognized its barbaric act as unworthy, and we had
an opportunity to return.''
   ``When we were leaving,'' Rostropovich said, the Soviet Union
``was an island of lies. Now is cleansing itself of these lies.''
   The cellist, who will give concerts Tuesday and Wednesday at the
Moscow Conservatory, presented Soviet health officials with 1
million single-use syringes Monday to help in the campaign against
AIDS.

   Munich Philharmonic conductor Sergiu
Celibidache will give several concerts in Bucharest next week after
years of refusing to perform in his native country, the state
Rompres news agency said Monday.
   Celibidache, who has been conducting in Munich since 1979, will
perform works by Giuseppe Verdi, Richard Strauss, Johannes Brahms
and others at Bucharest's famed Atheneum Concert Hall pieces.
   Some of the concerts will be broadcast live on Eurovision TV
network to Western Europe, Rompress said.
   Celibidache left Romania shortly after the post-war Communist
takeover and returned for a number of performances in the late
1970s.
   But he refused to return later because of differences with the
cultural council under the regime of Nicolae Ceausescu, the
Communist dictator who was overthrown and executed in December.
   One issue of contention was the refusal of the former council to
allow young Romanian conductors to receive stipends from
Celibidache for musical training abroad.
   The council was replaced last month by a minister of culture led
by Andrei Plesu, a leading ex-dissident and art critic who had been
banished by Ceausescu to a small village in northeastern Romania to
work as a curator at a local museum.

   The Ford Foundation invited 200 colleges and
universities on Monday to compete for $1.6 million in grants aimed
at improving race relations and exploring other cultures.
   ``We are looking for projects that will help weave diversity
into the fabric of an institution's academic life and sense of
purpose,'' Ford Foundation President Franklin A. Thomas said in a
news release.
   The grants are being made because, Thomas said in a letter sent
to education leaders, ``On many college campuses, reports of racial
and religious intolerance and sexual harassment are rising.''
   ``Diversity makes an essential contribution to the education of
students,'' Thomas wrote, but added that ``some students find
diversity confusing or threatening.
   ``For these students, college is often the first journey out of
a homogeneous neighborhood into a more diverse world. Those who are
not ready or willing to relate to people of a different race,
religion or sexual orientation, or to relate to people with
profoundly different political and ethical convictions, will be
troubled and may express this through disruptive and hostile
behavior.''
   The grants may be used for course development or revision, study
groups, colloquia, cultural affairs, visiting speakers and for
acquiring or preserving materials used in undergraduate courses.
   The foundation plans to award 10 grants of up to $100,000 each
for new programs and smaller grants of up to $25,000 to expand or
enhance existing programs.
   Those asked to participate are schools that are largely or
wholly residential. They include small schools like Berea College
in Kentucky and Lincoln University in Pennsylvania and larger
universities and colleges like Yale in Connecticut and the
University of California.
   The Ford Foundation, established in 1936, is a private,
nonprofit institution whose goal is to preserve peace and advance
human welfare. The foundation, headquartered in New York, has
granted $7 billion to more than 9,000 institutions and 100,000
individuals worldwide.

   President Bush today praised the release of
Nelson Mandela as a ``dramatic sign'' that South Africa is moving
toward a more racially equitable society, but he said it was too
early to talk about lifting U.S. sanctions.
   By law, Bush told a news conference, the economic sanctions
enacted in 1986 ``remain on until the South Africans have taken
certain steps'' beyond just the release of the imprisoned black
nationalist leader.
   The president said he continues to find some of the sanctions
counterproductive _ as had the Reagan administration before him.
``I think American jobs there make sense,'' he said.
   At the same time, Bush said his invitation South African
President F.W. de Klerk to visit him at the White House bore no
conditions. Bush extended separate invitations to both Mandela and
de Klerk.
   ``I think his coming here evidences that we see in him a new
brand of leadership,'' the president said of de Klerk.
   He praised the South African leader for taking steps that ``move
South Africa down the road toward racial equality.''
   Asked if he was uncomfortable by links between the Communist
Party in South Africa and Mandela, Bush said: ``Too hypothetical.
What's good is he's out of there.''
   ``I'm not embracing every position of the ANC (Mandela's African
National Congress),'' Bush said. ``What I'm embracing is the
concept that he's out of jail.''
   In any event, he said, ``I think these Communist parties are for
the most part sliding down hill. What's coming uphill is democracy
and freedom and I would hope steps Mr. de Klerk is taking would
enhance that view that democracy and freedom are on the move.''
   Earlier today, in a speech welcoming Denis Sassou-Nguesso, the
president of the Congo, to the White House, Bush also promised that
the United States will not overlook Africa in its concern with the
events unfolding in Europe.
   ``Africa's our friend, and friends don't forget one another,''
he said.
   Bush said the release of Mandela after 27 years in prison ``is
another important sign that South Africa may soon begin negotiating
a democratic non-racial society and at last be on the way to ending
apartheid once and for all.''
   ``Some have suggested that events in the rest of the world
including central Europe mean that the United States will no longer
pay attention to Africa. I can assure and everyone in Africa that
this is not the case,'' said Bush. He noted he visited Africa three
times as vice president ``and hope to be able to do so again.''
   Bush praised the Congolese president's role in bringing peace to
southwest Africa. Sassou-Nguesso called Bush a ``great figure'' and
heir to the legacy of two centuries of freedom. He also hailed
Mandela as ``a great symbol of dignity for African men,'' and said
his release ``ushers in great prospects for the negotiation of the
future of South African society.''
   Bush telephoned the newly liberated black leader on Sunday and
invited him to visit the White House. Afterwards, Bush had only
words of praise for both Mandela and de Klerk.
   Meanwhile, in television interviews this morning, the State
Department's top policymaker on Africa said it may be time to
``make some gesture'' toward Pretoria to encourage further progress
in race relations.
   The assistant secretary of state for African affairs, Herman
Cohen, said on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show this morning that while
``sanctions played a positive role in changing the thinking of the
white government, ... the main reason for changing policy down
there is what happened internally _ the pressure from the black
majority, economic realities, demographic realities. We just helped
nudge them along.''
   ``I think we should (make some kind of gesture) because when
progress takes place, we should try to encourage more progress,''
Cohen said.
   ``The legislation we're working under provides for relaxation of
sanctions when there is progress. I think we're rapidly reaching
that point, but we're not going to make any decisions until we've
consulted very closely with the Congress because it's a major
political decision,'' the State Department official said.
   Speaking on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' Cohen said ``what we
really care about is encouraging further progress. If that means
relaxation of sanctions, fine.''
   Two lawmakers, also appearing on ``Today,'' indicated that
Congress would move cautiously in lifting the sanctions.
   ``I think the talk is premature and I suspect that it will
continue for a while, but people ought to consider the fact that
the talk (recently in Congress) was that more sanctions ought to be
imposed,'' said Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind. ``One factor perhaps in
the timing of all this was to avoid debate in the U.S. Congress.''
   Rep. William Gray III, D-Pa., the House majority whip, said:
``The law is very specific in terms of its requirement before the
president can be making a recommendation. I'm not sure that there
has been a compliance with all of those (requirements).''
   Bush said he told Mandela ``that all Americans were delighted
after these many years in jail that he was released, that we were
rejoicing at his release.''
   Bush said he told Mandela the United States wants ``to see a
peaceful evolution towards a totally racially free South Africa, a
society without prejudice, a society of total freedom.''
   They did not discuss the future of sanctions.
   Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs subcommittee on Africa, said South Africa has not yet met
the conditions for lifting sanctions.
   ``We need to adopt the same standard as we adopted to
approaching Poland and the Soviet Union and other countries in
Eastern Europe. We respond positively, but we do not reduce the
pressure,'' said Wolpe.
   South Africa's minority white population of 5 million has
maintained control through its apartheid laws and denial of
political rights to the 26 million black residents.
   The Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986 _ passed over the veto of
then-President Reagan _ stipulated that before sanctions could be
lifted, South Africa had to free all political prisoners and meet
at least three of four other criteria. De Klerk already has met one
of the conditions by legalizing the African National Congress and
other anti-apartheid groups.
   The other conditions include an agreement by the government to
engage in good faith negotiations on South Africa's political
future, the lifting of the state of emergency, and substantial
progress toward dismantling apartheid.

<HEAD>Concerns Voiced Over Soviet Nuclear Stockpiles at Time of Unrest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, concerned over whose finger stays on the button of the
Soviet Union's 30,000 nuclear weapons in a time of internal tumult,
is proposing that the Kremlin mount a ``fail-safe'' review of
controls on its nuclear arsenals.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., also wants the United States to conduct
such an independent review of its own safeguards against the
unauthorized or accidental launch of nuclear weapons and says his
committee will do the job if the Pentagon fails to act.
   With ethnic and political tensions straining Soviet unity, many
American military experts and key congressional figures are
fretting about the possibility that a nuclear missile could be
unleashed on the world without the knowledge or approval of the
Kremlin.
   ``My worst-case fear for the last several months is that we
would wake up one morning and discover that an ethnic liberation
front had obtained control of 100 nuclear weapons,'' said a
military expert on the staff of the House Armed Services Committee.
   ``Nuclear weapons are in every Soviet republic that is
potentially rebellious,'' said the source, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   ``It's a legitimate problem to worry about,'' he said. ``I'm not
having nightmares about it. Stealing a nuclear weapon is not a
simple thing to do. We know you can't just walk into a Soviet
missile silo and fire them.''
   But he added the equation might change if an ethnic faction
seized control of an entire province.
   Bruce G. Blair of the Brookings Institution notes that the
Soviets may have 100 or so nuclear weapons stored near Baku, in
Soviet Azerbaijan, site of recent violent clashes between Moslem
Azerbaijanis and Christian Armenians.
   Until Soviet troops entered Baku to restore order, widespread
reports had gunmen seizing conventional arms and ammunition from
Soviet depots.
   ``It's a concern people are paying attention to, trying to
monitor,'' Blair said. ``I think the Soviets themselves are so
concerned about this problem that they're handling it just fine.''
   Ethic violence flared again Monday, this time in the
predominantly Moslem Asian republic of Tadzhikistan. Soviet
authorities reported rioting in the capital city of Dushanbe, with
mobs angry over rumors that Armenian refugees were getting
preferential treatment. There were deaths and dozens of injuries
and reports of looting before authorities declared a state of
emergency and imposed a curfew.
   The issue of control over nuclear weapons may soon be explored
in extraordinary public fashion, at a time the superpowers
apparently are nearing agreement on several arms control accords.
   Yevgeni Velikhov, chairman of the Supreme Soviet's defense
subcommittee, proposes an unprecedented joint hearing with the
House Armed Services Committee to explore ways of reducing the
danger of unauthorized or accidental launches of nuclear weapons.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House panel, says he is
open to the idea of a joint meeting, leaving the topic of such a
session to be settled later.
   Nunn said in an interview: ``I think you have to worry about
thousands of nuclear weapons in a nation that has a lot of
turmoil.''
   Nunn wants the Kremlin to review the effectiveness of
``fail-safe'' procedures to insulate their nuclear weapons from the
country's political troubles. ``I hope we can persuade them to do
it,'' he said.
   The two superpowers should cooperate more closely on the issue
because ``this is one area of technology that it would pay both
sides to share,'' he said.
   ``In the event of instability, people have to be worried about
who would be in charge,'' said Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a former
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   Like others, Lugar noted that a probable silver lining to their
worries is the continued cohesiveness of the Soviet military.
   ``There seems to be no instability whatsoever in the Soviet
armed forces,'' Lugar said. ``They appear to be in full control of
nuclear weapons, short- or long-range.''
   The Soviets have an extensive security system to protect their
nuclear weapons, placing missile sites in remote locations,
surrounding their perimeters with heavily armed guards, separating
weapons from launchers and triggers, and installing multiple launch
controls.

   Fans have offered an outpouring of affection
to song-and-dance star Sammy Davis Jr., who remains hospitalized
with throat cancer, Davis' spokeswoman said Monday.
   ``He's in touch with friends and family and is receiving bagfuls
of messages from throughout the world,'' Susan Reynolds said.
   She declined to reveal Davis' condition, however, saying only,
``He remains hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center of Los
Angeles undergoing appropriate treatment for a recurrence of
carcinoma of the throat.''
   A hospital spokesman referred inquiries to Ms. Reynolds.
   Davis, 64, was diagnosed with throat cancer in September.
   The versatile singer-dancer, whose career has stretched from
poverty to the Las Vegas stage and motion pictures, most recently
appeared in the 1989 movie ``Tap,'' playing an old-time tap dancer
named Little Mo.
   During a tribute earlier this month, the thinning Davis appeared
weak and was in obvious declining health.

   President Bush said today that the United
States and the Soviet Union made ``solid progress'' last week
toward arms control agreements, but cautioned against hope that
three treaties might be ready by the time of his June summit with
Mikhail Gorbachev.
   The president said he hoped he and Gorbachev could sign a troop
reduction agreement this year and that treaties should be
``substantially completed'' on reducing long range nuclear weapons
and chemical weapons by the time of the summit. He rejected
Gorbachev's counterproposal to his own initiative to cut European
troops.
   At a White House news conference that focused almost exclusively
on fast-moving subjects of foreign affairs, Bush said the issue of
German reunification was up to the German people. He ruled out a
neutral nation and said whatever emerges would have to remain a
member of NATO.
   He also offered to play a mediating role in resolving South
Africa's racial conflict if it seemed appropriate.
   Fielding questions in the White House briefing room, Bush was
asked about Nelson Mandela's declaration that armed struggle
against the white minority in South Africa should continue. He said
he would discourage violence, and said the South African leader _
freed Sunday after 27 years in prison _ had said such actions
should be ``defensive.''
   ``We've always advocated nonviolence and I think the United
States ought not to move away from that,'' he said.
   Bush ruled out a partial lifting of sanctions against South
Africa, saying he was barred from taking that step despite
Mandela's release. Asked about Mandela's alliance with communists,
Bush said he saw communism ``sliding downhill'' throughout the
world, with democracy on the ascent.
   Bush said he believed both Mandela and South African President
F.W. deKlerk had accepted his invitations to visit the White House
``in principle'' but that no date was set for either to visit.
Asked whether he expected to play a major role in the discussions
between Mandela and the South African government, Bush said:
   ``If such a role would be productive, I certainly would. But I
have the feeling ... they feel that can talk to each other without
the U.S. catalytic role. But sure if we could be helpful in a way
of that nature then sure.''
   In an opening statement, Bush tossed a bouquet at Gorbachev and
his communist colleagues in Moscow, embracing their movement
``toward pluralism'' last week when the Communist party endorsed a
plan to give up its monopoly on power in the Soviet Union.
   Bush, who had called for deep force cuts in Europe, nonetheless
rejected Gorbachev's counterproposal that would have left both
sides with 195,000 troops in Europe. To attain this level,
Gorbachev wanted the United States to recall 30,000 troops in
countries _ Great Britain, Italy, Greece and Turkey _ not covered
under the original negotiations.
   The president said the disagreement didn't amount to an impasse
in the negotiations, saying, ``This is the way it works.''
   Bush hailed Gorbachev's declaration that Germans should decide
their own fate, and said the time was not yet right for a meeting
of the four nations who hold occupation rights as a result of World
War II _ the Soviet Union, the United States, France and England.
   The president also said that if East Germany was to join West
Germany in a unified nation, the new Germany should be a member of
NATO. He said there was flexibility on where Western troops could
be positioned within the new country.
   Bush opened his news conference by saying he wanted to
``commend'' the developments in the Soviet Union last week in which
the Communist party was stripped of its automatic leading role in
governing the country.
   He noted ``solid progress'' by Secretary of State James Baker
III in his talks in Moscow. He said the talks had covered
conventional arms control, long range nuclear weapons, nuclear
testing and chemical weapons, as well as issues such as Central
America and Afghanistan.
   He said the talks had accomplished ``much`` of what he and
Gorbachev had hoped for when they set up the negotiations at their
Malta summit last December.
   ``I am confident that if we continue this kind of momentum ...
the June summit will be a major success,'' he said.
   At the same time, Bush said ``I'm not sure there will be three
treaties to be signed by the time we have this summit. But I think
there's going to be progress toward all three.''
   He said the goal was to get the agreement signed on reduction of
conventional forces in Europe.
   On other issues Bush:
   _ Said he would decide shortly whether to permit the sale of
leases for offshore drilling on the California Coast. He said that
despite last week's tanker spill, ``I'll be damned if I think we
ought to shut down offshore drilling everywhere.''
   _ Said he would tell the presidents of Colombia, Peru and
Bolivia at a drug summit this week that the United States was
making major efforts to cut down the on the demand for cocaine in
this country.
   _ Said a long list of proposed military base closings was drawn
up ``without political favoritism,'' and urged Congress to drop the
``age old adage, `cut here, cut there but don't cut in my
district.''

   Rabbi Haskel Werzberger, who survived the
Auschwitz death camp as a child 45 years ago, died Monday of a
bullet wound from a thief who accosted him last week on his way to
morning prayers. He was 58.
   Werzberger, a leader of the 25,000 Jews of the Satmar Hasidic
sect in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, died early Monday,
four days after the shooting. About 200 family and sect members had
kept a vigil at Bellevue Hospital, where Werzberger underwent
surgery and was kept on a respirator.
   His funeral was held later in the day at Congregation Yetev Lev
and drew a police-estimated 8,000 mourners, including Brooklyn
District Attorney Charles J. Hynes.
   Moses Teitelbaum, the grand rabbi of the ultra-Orthodox sect,
delivered one of five eulogies.
   ``The death of this man of peace has diminished the lives of all
New Yorkers,'' Gov. Mario Cuomo said in a statement.
   Werzberger was shot early Thursday as he sat warming up a car,
preparing to drive from his apartment to the synagogue for morning
prayers.
   The gunman dragged him from the car and drove off, leaving
Werzberger bleeding in the street. The car was found Friday in
another Brooklyn neighborhood, the driver's seat and dashboard
spattered with paint.
   A $10,000 reward for information that leads to the killer has
been offered, but no arrests had been made Monday.
   Werzberger was born in Hungary and emigrated with others of the
Satmar sect after World War II. He leaves his wife, Rifka; two sons
and four daughters; a brother and numerous grandchildren, said
Satmar spokesman Isaac Abraham.

<TEXT>
   A special state environmental panel on Monday
called for increased public disclosure about operations at the
Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant.
   ``In order to be a responsible neighbor to millions of people
living nearby, the Rocky Flats plant must be open and honest about
its operations and their impact and be willing to listen and
respond to the community's concerns,'' said state Rep. Sam
Williams, chairman of the Rocky Flats Environmental Monitoring
Council.
   Gov. Roy Romer and U.S. Rep. David Skaggs appointed the
11-member council in January 1988 to promote communication between
the plant and concerned public agencies and the public; and to
monitor environmental, safety and public health concerns.
   The plant 16 miles northwest of Denver manufactures highly
radioactive plutonium detonators for nuclear weapons.
   It has been under investigation by a federal grand jury since
shortly after a raid on June 6, 1989, by scores of FBI and
Environmental Protection Agency agents investigating allegations of
illegal radioactive waste storage and disposal.
   Plutonium operations at the plant were suspended in November by
Energy Secretary James Watkins until health and safety concerns are
met. No startup date has been announced but sources have said
plutonium processing could resume in late spring or summer.
   The DOE also transferred management of the plant to EG&amp;G, a
major defense contractor, from Rockwell International on Jan. 1.
   The council noted in its report ``that improved communication is
critically needed. DOE and its contractors have historically
demonstrated a reluctance to share information about the general
operation of Rocky Flats, about incidents and problems that have
occurred and about anticipated future problems. This lack of
openness has aggravated public mistrust of the plant and its
possible impacts upon the environment and public health safety.''
   Melinda Kassen, a senior attorney for the Environmental Defense
Fund, said the report contains ``nothing new or revolutionary.''
   The report serves as ``an exclamation point at the end of what's
already been said,'' Kassen added.
   Kassen said the Bush administration did not include funding in
its budget proposal for the plant's five-year plan for
environmental restoration, new initiatives for waste management and
corrective activities for complying with existing legal
requirements.
   Among the report's recommendations:
   _Full funding of health studies to assess the effect of plant
discharges on the community and reactivation and expansion of a
study of effects on Rocky Flats workers.
   _Minimum level plutonium processing until a previously initiated
safety review is completed and all suggested corrective actions are
implemented.
   _Strict air emission monitoring.
   _Issuance of publicinformation papers by the Rocky Flats plant
openly discussing tough issues facing the plant.
   _Placement of various oversight responsibilities for nuclear
weapons plants outside the Department of Energy.
   _Formal agreement not to permanently dispose of any wastes at
Rocky Flats and to put a premium on eliminating offsite discharges
of hazardous materials.

   Here is a transcript of President Bush's news
conference Monday at the White House:
   Bush: Good afternoon. Well, this has been an extraordinary and
positive week in East-West relations. And in the Soviet Union
progress was made at the Central Committee Plenum on moving the
Soviet political system toward pluralism and genuine respect for
the views of the Soviet electorate. I commend this development
which demonstrates once again why our administration has supported
Chairman Gorbachev's efforts to extend glasnost and perestroika
through the Soviet Union.
   Secretary Baker's visit to Moscow made solid progress in pushing
the US-Soviet agenda forward in preparation for the June summit
here. We made important headway on conventional arms control,
START, nuclear testing and chemical weapons and continued to
explore ways to reduce our differences on regional issues,
especially concerning Central America and Afghanistan.
   All in all, Secretary Baker's talks in Moscow accomplished much
of what Chairman Gorbachev and I intended when we set the goals for
this meeting during our discussions at Malta. I am confident that
if we continue this kind of momentum in our bilateral relationship
with the Soviet Union, the June summit will be a major success.
   And, finally, I want to congratulate Chancellor Kohl for his
successful visit to Moscow. His visit reflects the accelerating
pace of German self-determination. And the statements on German
unity on the Soviet side _ by the Soviet side were most welcome.
And we support Chancellor Kohl's position that a unified Germany
should remain a member of NATO. Let me also express my appreciation
of Chairman Gorbachev's statesmanlike view that decisions regarding
German unity should be left to the people of Germany.
   I made a statement this morning on the wonderful news of the
release of Mr. Mandela, so I will leave that to the question
period. But, Terry, I understand you have the first question.
   Q: Yes, Mr. President, what is your reaction to Mr. Gorbachev's
counterproposal for troop cuts in Europe? And in the wake of
Secretary Baker's visit to Moscow, what do you think the likelihood
is that there'll be three treaties to be signed this year _
chemical, strategic and conventional?
   Bush: Well, I, let me take the last one first. I'm not sure that
there will be three treaties to be signed by the time we have this
summit, but I think there's going to be progress towards all three.
And it's still our goal to get that agreement signed.
   On the troops, where Gorbachev wanted to have either 195,000 or
225,000, we're going to stay with our proposal because we don't see
this linkage to that degree. We're talking about the forward
deployment there in Europe, the 195,000, and that's what we're
challenging him to reduce. And we've got a big ocean between us and
Western Europe.
   And so, the argument that we should always have a linked
reduction is one that I want to get away from now. We've _ I think
we've made some real progress on this, and I was very pleased with
his reaction to our proposal. But I don't think we need to have
exact linkage from this point on.
   Q: Well, if you're rejecting his counterproposal, is there an
impasse now?
   Bush: I wouldn't call it an ``impasse.'' You know, this is the
way it works when you're discussing these arms control things. No,
I don't think we've got an impasse.
   Q: With the breakup of the Soviet empire and you want Germany to
remain in NATO, who's the enemy?
   Bush: What was that?
   Q: Who's the enemy? Who are they supposed to be fighting against?
   Bush: Who?
   Q: The NATO troops, U.S. troops in Germany.
   Bush: The US troops are there as a stabilizing factor. Nobody
can predict, Helen, with total certainty what tomorrow is going to
look like. I've been wrong, you've been wrong, he's been wrong,
she's been wrong on how it's going. And we don't know.
   Q: But hasn't the Soviet Union _
   Bush: And our _ may I finish, please?
   Q: OK.
   Bush: Our European allies want us there. I have a feeling that
some of the Eastern Europeans want us there, because they know that
the United States is there as a stabilizing factor, and we will be
there for a long time to come, hopefully at significantly reduced
numbers.
   Q: May I just add, Mr. President, that there's a wide perception
that your whole military budget is out of sync, that you're tone
deaf into what's been happening, and that there is a possibility of
this money going for distressing domestic need.
   Bush: I don't think that perception is widespread with the
American people. I think the American people want a cautious
approach to this. I don't think any of us think we can see with
clairvoyance as to what's going to happen the day after tomorrow.
And we are reducing our defense expenditures. We've sent a budget
proposal up there that makes good sense.
   You're right, some of the Democrats are jumping all over us. But
that's all right, that just goes with the system.
   The main thing is the Europeans, our staunchest allies, want us
there, because they see the U.S. as a stabilizing presence, and so
we're going to remain there. Now, as I say, I hope negotiations go
so well that we can have substantially reduced numbers over the
years.

   An inmate whose drug convictions were
overturned last month is near death after an 11-month hunger strike
and will be force-fed while prosecutors appeal his case, his
attorney said Monday.
   Rene Acuna, 37, of Detroit has dropped to just over 100 pounds
and a prison doctor says his weakened heart may fail, said Paul
Denenfeld, legal director for the Michigan chapter of the American
Civil Liberties Union.
   Acuna is still imprisoned because he is unable to meet a
$100,000 bond.
   ``I think at this point what we are seeing is an example of how
the justice system can break down,'' Denenfeld said.
   ``We have three appeals court judges saying the man should never
have been in jail in the first place. We think it is outrageous
that he is still in jail. He should already be out.''
   Department of Corrections spokeswoman Gail Light said doctors
began force-feeding Acuna at 11 a.m. Monday after receiving
permission from his court-appointed guardian, Anna Sossa.
   ``I can generally say the doctors believe this is a
life-threatening situation and they need to get some nutrition down
him again,'' she said.
   Acuna weighed 180 pounds when he began his hunger strike March
3, shortly after he was convicted. The convictions carried
mandatory terms of life in prison without parole.
   He refused to resume eating after the Michigan Court of Appeals
threw out his convictions for lack of evidence in a ruling released
Jan. 23.
   The Cuban immigrant said he will not eat until he can return
home to Sossa, his longtime companion, and his two daughters.
   He is at the Duane L. Waters Hospital next to the State Prison
of Southern Michigan in Jackson, unable to post a $100,000 bond
while the Macomb County Prosecuting Attorney's office appeals to
the Michigan Supreme Court.
   Carole Murray, chief of the drug unit in the prosecutor's
office, said the appeal was filed Friday.
   Sossa said she agreed to permit the force-feeding because prison
doctors threatened to go to court to have her removed as guardian
and because she fears for Acuna's life.
   ``He's really in bad shape. If he dies now after he has won his
appeal, what are we going to get? Nothing,'' she said. ``I don't
want to give (Macomb County Prosecutor Carl) Marlinga the pleasure
that he dies.''
   After the appeal bond was set Feb. 1, Acuna refused his regular
diet of water and coffee with sugar and refused to be weighed,
Denenfeld said. Acuna weighed 107 pounds before the appeal bond
hearing and may be just over 100 pounds by now, he said.
   Prosecutors accused Acuna of serving as a lookout for a 1988
drug buy, during which undercover agents bought cocaine. Acuna has
denied any involvement.
   The appeals court reversed Acuna's convictions of delivery and
conspiracy to deliver more than two pounds of cocaine and refused
to order a new trial.
   Acuna was force-fed last fall after his weight plunged below 107
pounds and gained about 20 pounds, but resumed his hunger strike
after the nasal feeding tube was removed.

<HEAD>Buffalo's Blacks Hardest Hit By Industrial Decline</HEAD>

   Blacks could hold the key to a resurgent
Buffalo, says the author of a study released Monday that is billed
as the most comprehensive ever done of a single black community.
   Blacks began migrating to Buffalo in large numbers around 1940,
just about the time when the city's industries began a slump from
which they never really recovered, said the study conducted by the
State University of New York at Buffalo.
   ``At that point when thousands of new residents were pouring
into Buffalo, the city's economy was beginning to change,''
researcher Henry Louis Taylor Jr. told a news conference. ``The
jobs that lured black people to Buffalo were disappearing almost as
fast as they could get them.''
   ``The Buffalo labor force is old,'' he said. ``There is no
population younger than the African-American community. If you
train them ... you solve one of Buffalo's major problems.''
   The unemployment rate among blacks in Buffalo was 26 percent in
1940, 16 percent in 1960 and 21 percent in 1980, a consistent 8
percent higher than the city's overall unemployment rate for those
years, said Taylor, director of SUNY-Buffalo's Center for Applied
Public Affairs Studies.
   The study addresses housing, education, crime and the quest for
community among the city's 94,262 blacks.
   University officials said it was the most comprehensive study
ever of a single black community. The Buffalo Urban League and the
Common Council, which commissioned the study, plan to use it for a
range of policy issues.
   The report suggests that the East Side, where 84 percent of
Buffalo's black residents live, should become one of the city's top
priorities for economic and social reform before it becomes a
disaster area like the slums of Chicago or Detroit.
   Taylor said city leaders should officially designate the East
Side as a Development Zone, the target of a coordinated effort to
transform it into a wholesome community, or in Taylor's words, ``a
Renaissance City.''
   Leroy Coles, the Urban League's president, said it will be hard
to persuade city leaders that the East Side's rebirth should be a
priority.
   ``City Hall, it seems to me, has to become more concerned about
the growing population suffering from a number of things this
report speaks to,'' Coles said. ``The report is a good way for
white folks to begin to understand that this is not only about our
problems, but about theirs as well.''
   The report says that while many Buffalo blacks own their own
homes, the homes are likely to be shabby and the owners are
unlikely to have enough money to fix them up properly.
   Blacks are more likely to be arrested than whites of the same
age for all crimes except, surprisingly, drug offenses, the report
said.
   At the same time, there are encouraging signs, such as the fact
that the East Side contains a broad cross-section of middle-class
and working-class blacks and a large array of community
organizations, Taylor said.

   Conservative African leaders
responded to Nelson Mandela's release by calling Monday for closer
ties with Pretoria, which is wooing black Africa with cheap goods
and promises of aid.
   Hard-line states such as Nigeria and Zimbabwe issued predictable
statements endorsing sanctions and urging no leniency toward the
Pretoria government.
   But Gabon's President Omar Bongo, basking in the euphoria
surrounding Mandela's release Sunday after more than 27 years in
prison, declared it ``a triumph for dialogue over cannons and
guns.''
   ``We need to review our relations with South Africa, to
re-establish diplomatic ties, even if we do not send ambassadors,''
Bongo said in a radio broadcast.
   His declaration indicated a growing chasm in black Africa's
often hypocritical stand on South Africa.
   Most African countries trade with Pretoria, but few openly
acknowledge the economic links made more attractive recently by the
weakened South African currency and some states' over-valued
currencies, particularly those French-speaking Africa.
   The Ivory Coast, reported to be considering diplomatic relations
with Pretoria, urged a new approach to President F.W. de Klerk's
government.
   ``The time has come for Africa to end its current opposition (to
the South African goverment) and to encourage and support the
efforts of President de Klerk,'' said Foreign Minister Simeon Ake.
   President Felix Houphouet-Boigny sent a telegram to Mandela
appealing to him to negotiate with de Klerk and implicitly chiding
the newly released leader for his endorsement of violence against
apartheid.
   ``The whole world and all Africa is counting on you to work
through dialogue toward a triumph for the noble cause of peace,
equality and brotherhood,'' Boigny said.
   He also praised de Klerk, who visited the Ivory Coast in
December.
   ``History will ... pay you homage for the personal part you have
played in the changes that give great hopes to all South African
people for the building of a great and democratic nation,''
Houphouet-Boigny said.
   Other African countries welcomed Mandela's release, but joined
his African National Congress in warning that much work lies ahead.
   Nigeria's military government said Mandela's release is
``positive proof that concerted pressure on the apartheid regime,
including mandatory sanctions, continue to have the desired
effect.''
   Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe urged the world not to be
deceived into believing de Klerk has yet ``tackled the substantive
issues of apartheid.''
   Mugabe, like the leaders of Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Liberia,
said Mandela's release must be followed by freedom for all
political prisoners, the lifting of emergency regulations and the
repeal of all racist laws.
   A Liberian government statement said Pretoria's action
accentuated the need for continued international pressure on South
Africa.
   But it welcomed Mandela's release from an imprisonment it called
``a violation of his fundamental human rights.''
   Liberia itself is drawing increasing international criticism for
human rights abuses that culminated in January with the alleged
killings of at least 500 civilians by troops fighting to put down
an ethnic rebellion. The killings have caused some 144,000 refugees
to flee the country.
   As the world celebrated Mandela's release Sunday, the West
African state of Senegal, which boasts it is a democracy, quickly
detained opposition leader Abdoulaye Wade as he returned home from
a six-month exile.
   Wade claims his Senegalese Democratic Party won February 1988
elections in which President Abdou Diouf claimed victory for his
Socialist Party.
   Some Western countries accuse African governments of similar
hypocrisy in their calls for sanctions against South Africa.

   Q: Mr. President, does the release of Nelson Mandela and the
other steps announced by President De Klerk in South Africa alter
in any way your views toward United States' economic sanctions,
which, of course, the Reagan administration and you as a part of it
were never very enthusiastic about?
   Bush: What do you mean, in the sense of altering my views as to
what we ought to do in the future?
   Q: Well, as to whether they work or not.
   Bush: Well, I don't know that one can attribute all the change
in South Africa to sanctions. Now, we've got some sanctions on
there, and by law, they remain on until the South Africans have
taken certain steps. And I think that, you know, somebody asked me
about this yesterday, I said, ``Well, I can't judge.'' Frankly, I
think some are counterproductive. I happen to think American jobs
there make good sense, and I don't think they perpetuate the status
quo. But I think what's really changed is the mindset of the South
African leadership, and I think that we ought to give Mr. De Klerk
certain credit for being able to look much more realistically about
political change, and hopefully, more favorably about a society
that eventually eliminates this racism that is equated with
apartheid.
   Q: Well, would you be willing to push for the lifting of any of
the sanctions before all of the conditions set forth in the law
have been met?
   Bush: We can't do that. I'm bound by the law. And what I do want
to do is discuss these provisions with Mr. Mandela and with Mr. De
Klerk. And I've invited both of them to come here, and I also want
to see them continue to talk with each other. And then out of that,
I think we'll have a much more realistic picture of what the United
States might do in the future.
   Q: Nelson Mandela continues to call for armed struggle to
overturn apartheid. When he comes to the White House, would you
urge him to adopt the non-violent tactics of Martin Luther King?
   Bush: Yes, I would. But what I _ and I hope I didn't misread it.
I read his statement to be more on the defensive side when I looked
at it this morning. But I _ yes, we've always advocated
nonviolence, and I think the United States ought not to move away
from that.
   Q: If I can follow-up on the question of the sanctions. Are
there things that you can do for the South African government apart
from lifting sanctions? You realize that by law, you can't lift
sanctions unilaterally. Are there other things you can do, other
than just asking De Klerk to come to Washington?
   Bush: Well, I would say out of the meeting with Mr. De Klerk, I
would have a clear perception of what other things might be. I
think having him here is a major step. I think it's a very
important step. And so I would simply have to defer on that
question until I have a chance to talk to him.
   Q: Mr. President, there are those who say keeping on with
sanctions _ that now is more of a time than ever to keep all the
pressure on, and if not keeping the pressure on, even go one step
further. I wonder if you intended your invitation to Mr. De Klerk
as a reward for what he's done, given that no South African
President has ever been here before? And secondly, do you think
it's time, regardless of what you think of sanctions, to reward
them in some other way?
   Bush: Reward?
   Q: Reward South Africa.
   Bush: Well, I don't know about rewards. I think his coming here
evidences the fact that we see in him a new brand of leadership, a
man who is making dramatic changes in South Africa. The freeing of
Mandela clearly is a very positive sign. And so I think there's
much more to be done, but there are things that he has done that I
think deserve our support and, I'd say, appreciation because I
think these steps he's taking move South Africa down the road
towards racial equity.
   Q: Mr. President, on Germany. Would you be willing to consider a
situation where a united Germany was not necessarily a full member
of NATO?
   Bush: No, I think that Chancellor Kohl is absolutely correct and
we ought to support him: NATO membership. And I think it's
stabilizing, I think it's good. There might be some flexibility,
obviously on deployment of NATO forces, but in terms of membership,
I think that is the most reassuring and stabilizing concept. I
happen to believe that is the most reassuring and stabilizing in
terms of how the Eastern Europeans will eventually look at it,
maybe not today _
   Q: But you mean the same kind of membership that West Germany
now has.
   Bush: Sure, yeah. But as I _ there's some flexibility on
deployment of NATO forces into Eastern Europe. Nobody wants to
threaten the Soviet Union. As I was trying to say to Helen, the
U.S. presence is a stabilizing presence.
   Q: Mr. President, on the De Klerk visit that now seems to be
almost a fait accompli, are there any conditions on that? Does he
have to lift the state of emergency, and in your conversation with
him, did he tell you when he would do that?

<HEAD>Sex Offenders Would Get Choice: Castration or Longer Sentence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HAL SPENCER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Washington Senate on Monday narrowly
passed a measure allowing sex offenders to choose castration in
exchange for reducing their sentences by as much as 75 percent.
   The bill was approved 25-23 and sent to the House where Speaker
Joe King said the measure probably won't come up before next year.
   ``We just don't know if we're ready to experiment on the public
yet,'' King said.
   The measure, and other legislation aimed at repeat sex
offenders, is the Legislature's reaction to recent crimes,
including the sexual mutilation of a 7-year-old Tacoma boy.
   Senate critics accused backers of the bill of showing ``blood
lust'' and said such a law would dump unrepentant sex criminals
back on the streets years earlier than if they were to serve full
prison terms. They predicted the courts would throw out such a law.
   But sponsors said studies have shown castration to cut repeat
crime by 75 percent or more.
   ``Mutilation is too good for these people,'' said Sen. Brad
Owen. ``It should be mandatory for these creeps.''
   ``No one mentions cruel and unusual punishment of the
citizens,'' agreed Sen. Bob McCaslin.
   Both houses have approved tough sex-crimes legislation suggested
by a citizens task force appointed by Gov. Booth Gardner. Informal
negotiations are under way to iron out the differences.
   That legislation includes stiffer sentences, a procedure for
civil commitment of incorrigible sex offenders and more services
for victims.
   Sen. Ellen Craswell, sponsor of the castration bill, and her
Senate allies contend those efforts aren't enough.
   Surgical castration ``does affect violent behavior. The lowering
of testosterone level affects violence,'' said Craswell, referring
to a male sex hormon. She said she prefers life sentences for sex
criminals.
   Foes of the castration bill said it won't survive constitutional
scrutiny on 8th Amendment grounds of cruel and unusual punishment.
They noted the South Carolina Supreme Court so ruled in the case of
three rapists offered the option in exchange for suspended
sentences.
   Craswell's measure includes provisions for court hearings before
to castration to ensure the offender understands the legal,
medical, emotional and psychological consequences of surgical
castration.
   The bill would allow a 75 percent reduction from what the
sentence normally would be under the standard sentencing range used
by judges across the state.
   Gardner all but promised a veto if the measure should make it to
his desk. Studies don't prove castration is an effective deterrent,
and early releases for sex criminals could make the assault rate
even worse, he said.
   In the mutilation case, Earl Kenneth Shiner, who had a history
of violence to young people, was convicted last week of attempted
murder, rape and assault and could be sentenced to 99 years in
prison.

<HEAD>WASHN: do that?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bush: There are no conditions on my invitation, if that's the
question; absolutely not.
   Q: Well, would he come if the state of emergency has not been
lifted? He hasn't done that _
   Bush: I don't know, I don't know whether he would or not.
   Q: You didn't discuss that?
   Bush: No. I didn't discuss any conditions. I said I want him to
come. ``You have freed Nelson Mandela, you have taken certain steps
that are positive and we want to see more, we want to see you go
further, but you're welcome.'' And that's the way _
   Q: Mr. President, do you have any second thoughts about the trip
last week? I'm especially thinking of the war games with the Soviet
tanks, particularly when your views on the defense budget are well
known and the Central Committee was meeting at the same time?
   Bush: No, I think it was a good trip and I've read some
tick-tock inside here, but it doesn't bother me a bit. I think that
those people that were there understood that that training has
applications elsewhere. We've seen recent areas where military
force was used because it was well trained. And so I stand by that
was a very good trip. You see, I support our defense budget. I
think it makes sense, and the fact that we've got some critics up
there that don't like it, that's too bad. I think the American
people want to see us stay strong.
   Q: What signal does that send to Mr. Gorbachev, however, you
just praised a few minutes ago?
   Bush: Well, it sent a pretty good one, I guess, because we came
out of that meeting with some forward motion and I salute him. I
can't say the trip to the state of California's desert had a heck
of a lot to do with it, but if you'd listen to some of the critique
from Capitol Hill you'd have thought it had been a disaster. And
yet, I've told you, we've just completed one of the most successful
ministerial summits that we've had with the
   Soviets. So, you can't _ the critics up there on the Hill can't
have it both ways.
   Q: I just wanted to follow up on the East Germany question. You
said you thought that the Eastern Europeans would ultimately come
to see this alliance with NATO as a positive thing too. Are you
suggesting, sir, that there is something less threatening about a
Germany that is in alliance _ in the alliance rather than a neutral
Germany?
   Bush: I think so because I think that a Germany inside the NATO
alliance _ they're good NATO partners now and they'll be good NATO
partners then. And they're very closely linked to the United States
and I think that's a very good thing.
   Q: Can I just turn that around? Do you think that a neutral
Germany does pose a threat and potentially could be dangerous?
   Bush: Well, I know that's the concern of many Europeans, but
it's not the concern that _ it's a concern that would be allayed by
having West Germany _ having Germany a unified Germany inside of
NATO.
   Q: Mr. President, you indicated you don't think the conventional
talks are at an impasse. Would you be willing to consider an
arrangement, an agreement in which the U.S. was able to keep extra
troops in Europe, but at a number somewhat less than the 30,000?
   Bush: Well, we've made our proposal. Our allies _ I don't make
these proposals without consulting the allies _ and there's
agreement that these are the proper levels. It's a level that has
been scrubbed by our military and I think there's a happiness in
our own military about this. For this time in history, I think it's
the right level. And, so, we're not out there trying to trade that
away.
   Q: Mr. President, you said _ you talk often about the importance
of free markets to democracy, but Nelson Mandela supports the ANC
view about nationalizing the South African industries, including
banks and mines. How do you feel about that? And does that pose a
problem for real democracy in South Africa?
   Bush: We are not for nationalizing, we are for privatization
across the _ we're for free markets. And, so, if we have a
difference there, that's fine. We'll discuss it with him. But I'm
not about to embrace the idea that what we want to do is go down to
more socialism when socialism is folding, folding its hand and
going over to the other side all across the world. I mean, you see
this. So, this is _ this is, you know, a difference that we _ if
that's his view, why, certainly we're not going to embrace that.
   Q: Is that a severe obstacle, though, to having a successful
democracy there?
   Bush: Privatization of all the _ I mean, nationalization of all
the _ I don't necessarily associate nationalization, socialization
of industry, the goods and services produced belonging to the
state, I don't see that as particularly helpful towards democracy,
if that's what you mean. But what I think and what I do agree with
Mandela is, is to try to get a society that is _ that is not a
racist society, doesn't support a concept of apartheid.
   Q: On South Africa, the question is how far _ how willing are
you to become personally involved, your administration become
personally involved in facilitating negotiations between Mr.
Mandela and President De Klerk? Are you ready to play a role like
President Carter did in the Camp David Accords on the Middle East?

<HEAD>Ag Department Says Program Will Boost Farm Income</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The massive land-idling Conservation Reserve
Program will boost farm income and improve environmental quality
through the end of the century, an Agriculture Department report
said Monday.
   But consumers will pay somewhat higher food prices as farmers
take up to 45 million acres of highly erodible cropland from
production under 10-year contracts, the report said.
   The CRP was authorized by the 1985 farm law and signups so far
have resulted in about 34 million acres, an area almost the size of
Michigan.
   ``Consumer food costs will climb by $12.7 billion to $25.2
billion over the life of the CRP, peaking around 1995,'' the report
said. ``Food cost increases will be less than 1 percent in any
given year.''
   Under the plan, farmers agree to take fragile, highly erodible
land from crop production and plant it to protective grass and
trees.
   In return, the government helps pay the cost of the initial
plantings and then pays the farmer annual rent during the 10 years
of the contract. The payments average about $50 per acre annually.
   The report, prepared by the department's Economic Research
Service, was based on an assumption that the maximum of 45 million
acres would be enrolled in the long-term program.
   However, Congress set a minimum of 40 million acres to go with
the maximum of 45 million acres, and administration officials have
indicated the minimum will be the target.
   Robert J. Gray, a private conservation specialist and
consultant, said 45 million acres had been thought a reasonable
goal for the CRP. He said 5 million acres probably could be added
to the minimum 40 million through tree plantings in shelterbelts,
windbreaks and other projects.
   ``I would prefer 45 million acres, no question about it,'' Gray
said in a telephone interview. He said he had not seen the new USDA
report.
   The report said that 45 million acres in the CRP for 10 years
``increases commodity prices and reduces environmental problems
linked with soil erosion.''
   Further, it added, the price increases and production cuts
``cause ripple effects in the farm sector, agricultural industries
and other segments of the economy'' related to U.S. agriculture.
   ``Farm income (based on present values) will rise by $9.2
billion to $20.3 billion between 1986 and 1999 from higher
commodity prices and lower production costs,'' the report said.
``Landowners who plant trees as the cover crop on approximately 3.5
million CRP acres will gain $4.1 billion to $5.4 billion in
wealth.''
   Environmental benefits were estimated at $6 billion to $13.6
billion, mostly in off-farm areas being affected by agricultural
soil erosion. The value of improvements in surface water quality
from the CRP ranges from $1.9 billion to $5.3 billion.
   Wildlife habitat improvement was valued from $3 billion to $4.7
billion, and wind erosion abatement was projected at $400 million
to $1.1 billion.
   ``A 45-million-acre CRP will cost the federal government $21.5
billion to $22.8 billion in rents, bonuses, cost-sharing and
technical assistance,'' the report said. ``Most of these costs are
offset by savings in price and income support payments to farmers.''

<HEAD>Suspended `60 Minutes' Humorist Says Off-Camera Endorsements Are
Better</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUDIE GLAVE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Andy Rooney said Monday he appreciates what ``60
Minutes'' anchorman Mike Wallace said on the show about his
suspension from CBS but added that it was nothing like the
off-camera endorsement he got.
   ``I got great support from Mike on Friday,'' Rooney said in a
telephone interview. ``It was just wonderful. I wish the statement
on `60 Minutes' had been as good as he was in person.''
   Rooney said the statement by Wallace, made during the regular
Sunday ``60 Minutes'' broadcast, was written by ``60 Minutes''
producer Don Hewitt.
   The noncommittal statement acknowledged Rooney's suspension and
said his colleagues looked forward to his return.
   Rooney at first declined to say what he thought of the statement
but then added: ``I thought it would have been nice if it would
have been stronger in my support.''
   Rooney was suspended last week for three months by CBS News
President David Burke after a gay magazine, The Advocate, quoted
him as saying blacks have watered down their genes because ``the
less intelligent ones are the ones that have the most children.''
   The 69-year-old humorist denies having said it. The telephone
interview with Advocate reporter Chris Bull was not tape-recorded.
   Rooney says the support he's received from colleagues and
strangers alike has been ``incredible.''
   A CBS spokesman said the network's audience services unit has
received about 2,600 phone calls backing Rooney and 45 supporting
his suspension.
   ``It's like being at your own funeral. People I didn't even know
liked me have come to my support,'' Rooney said.
   ``People are beginning to see that it was a statement made by
people with a cause who were out to get me _ and got me,'' he said.
   Rooney had angered the gay community when he said on a Dec. 28
broadcast that ``many of the ills which kill us are self-induced.''
He then cited ``too much alcohol, too much food, homosexual unions,
cigarettes.''
   Rooney, a CBS employee for 40 years and ``60 Minutes'' humorist
since 1978, said he accepted the suspension because he had no
choice.
   ``I have my money, but I like my work. ... I did not want to
lose it, if that was weak of me. Of the alternatives, this was the
lesser.''
   Asked what his professional relationship with higher-ups would
be when he returned, Rooney said, ``They were awfully nice to me. I
don't know, it would be difficult in relationship to Mr. Burke, if
he's still there. It would be hard.''
   Rooney said he went to CBS Saturday to pick up some reference
books and paperwork but has not been in the office otherwise. ``I
don't know that I couldn't but I haven't. It just seems like bad
taste.''
   He said ``It's not easy for me to go out these days'' and added
that he was being hounded by supermarket tabloids and ``tacky TV
shows.''
   Rooney said he would use the suspension to work on a new book
about his experiences as an Army reporter during World War II,
write his twice-weekly syndicated newspaper column and concentrate
on ``losing weight.''

   Bush: If such a role would be productive, I certainly would. But
I have the feeling from the talks with both men _ just the short
phone conversations with both Mr. De Klerk and Mr. Mandela _ that
they feel they can talk to each other without the U.S. catalytic
role. But sure, if we could be helpful in a way of that nature, we
certainly would.
   Q: Mr. President, there are some people who are questioning the
need for a conventional forces treaty at all at this point, the
argument being that we're at a situation in which the East European
countries are going to invite all the Soviet troops to go home
anyway, and all that we'd be doing is codifying the Soviet presence
that isn't even wanted in Eastern Europe. What's your response to
that argument?
   Bush: I'd say it's very interesting and it may well be that the
pressure on the Soviets will have them withdraw to lower levels. I
don't think there's great sentiment in the Warsaw Pact countries
for a continued Soviet presence and that _ I'm not sure that it
would negate the need to have an agreement, I think the Soviets
would like to get our commitment, too. But you see, those troops
are not wanted in Eastern Europe anymore. Our troops are wanted by
the free world, and I suspect _ can't prove it _ that some
countries in the Warsaw Pact countries today would see us not as a
threatening presence, but as a stabilizing presence.
   Q: But is it possible the Soviets might use the treaty as an
excuse to keep troops where they're not even wanted?
   Bush: I don't think they can do that. I think they've got a
problem with a treaty _ a CFE treaty with us and others, but they
also have the problem of opinion inside these countries, and they
have enormous budgetary problems that make things very difficult.
   Q: Mr. President, what was your reaction to the rather effusive
embrace of the South African Communist Party and the presence of
the communist party flag on the balcony when Mr. Mandela made his
speech yesterday?
   Bush: I didn't notice that, but you see, I think these communist
parties, for the most part, are sliding downhill. And I think
what's coming uphill, and triumphantly so, is democracy and
freedom. And I would hope that the steps that Mr. De Klerk is
taking and has suggested be taken would enhance the view that
democracy and freedom are on the move.
   Q: To follow up, sir. If Mr. Mandela persists in allying himself
with the Communist Party, would that change your view of his _
   Bush: Too hypothetical. I mean, what's good is that he's out
there _ been in jail a long time _ and an interesting question back
here, but I'm not embracing every position of the ANC or of some of
the positions that are represented here today as Mr. Mandela's
positions. What I am doing is embracing the concept that it's good
that he's out of jail, and that it's good that the South Africans
seem to be moving towards a more equitable society.
   Q: Do you think it's time for a conference of the Four Powers on
Germany?
   Bush: No, not at this juncture. I know that idea has some
credibility right now, but I think it's moving along pretty well,
and we have always favored the self determination and _ but the
Germans have to sort this out at some point. Clearly, the Four
Powers will have to have some say, there's no question about that.
Whether it's two plus four or what the formulation is, we are not
locked on that at all.
   Q: If Gorbachev continues to insist on German neutrality, Mr.
President, do you think that could create a dangerous impasse that
would spawn a neutrality movement in West Germany?
   Bush: Not necessarily, but I think that we've seen the Soviet
Union's position change on the whole concept or the whole
acceptability of German reunification. It wasn't so long ago that
Mr. Gorbachev and the Soviet system were positioned very
skeptically about any reunification. And that's what was so
symbolic about the Kohl-Gorbachev meeting, and so important about
it. And I might say that it's a very emotional day for people in
Germany, GDR and FRG, highly emotional; brother separated from
brother, cousin from cousin and all of this, now with the chance to
have a peaceful reunification.

<BYLINE>Leadership Calls for Establishment of Strong Presidential Rule
^By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet leaders called Monday for a special session
of Congress to strengthen the office of president, a move that
would solidify Mikhail S. Gorbachev's hold on power.
   The development, coming on the heels of a landmark Communist
Party meeting at which the party agreed to give up its
constitutional monopoly on power, would strengthen the government
and further erode the party apparatus that has ruled the country
for 72 years.
   Gorbachev now holds the offices of party general-secretary and
of president. The new powers being proposed for the president would
make it more of a Western-style office.
   Tass said the presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the country's
highest executive body, ``unanimously favored the establishment of
democratic presidential power in our country.''
   The statement did not say whether the president should be
directly elected by voters, but one of Gorbachev's key allies on
the Communist Party Politburo said last week that a nationwide
popular election might be possible.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, speaking at the
three-day meeting last week of the party's policy-making Central
Committee, said a new draft of the Soviet Constitution now being
written could include ``direct and general elections for president
of the country.''
   Gorbachev ducked the question of whether he would run for
president if the office were up for national balloting.
   ``Let's wait and see,'' he told reporters on hand for his
meeting Friday with U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   The party's Central Committee approved the idea of a strong
presidency at its meeting last week.
   But in the text of its new platform, released Monday night in
Moscow, the party leadership left open the question of how the new,
stronger president should be selected.
   It said a strong presidency is necesary to ensure stability,
make reforms irreversible, make all government institutions
democratic, ensure law and order, and represent the Soviet Union
abroad.
   Another key Gorbachev ally on the Politburo, Alexander N.
Yakovlev, said Gorbachev was seeking election of a president to a
fixed term and would empower the president to choose the Cabinet.
   Gorbachev is now serving a five-year term as chairman of the
Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, informally referred to as
president, but his real power base remains the party, which he
leads as general secretary. But the party post has no certain term,
and in recent weeks party reformers have expressed concern that he
could be ousted by hard-liners opposed to his dramatic reforms.
   The party platform called for consolidation of the ``positions
and prerogatives of the Council of Ministers,'' or Cabinet, but it
was not clear what would happen to the post of premier. That job
now is held by Nikolai I. Ryzhkov.
   The party Central Committee decision last week cleared the way
for eventual establishment of opposition political parties. The
party leadership will call on legislators to remove the Soviet
Constitution's Article 6, which establishes the Communist Party as
the ``leading and guiding force'' in Soviet society.
   Tass said the presidium, headed by Gorbachev, would ask the
Supreme Soviet, or legislature, to call its 2,250-member parent
body, the Congress of People's Deputies, into session in the near
future. No date was proposed.
   The Supreme Soviet reconvenes on Wednesday and is likely to
follow the recommendation of its presidium.
   All constitutional questions, such as powers of the presidency,
must be decided by the Congress, which is supposed to meet briefly
twice a year.
   Under reforms pushed through by Gorbachev in December 1988, the
president is chosen by the Congress.
   The presidium said it called for the convening of Congress
because of the debate going on in Soviet society about the role of
the Communist Party and political reforms.
   Government leaders want the Congress to consider a variety of
other issues concerning the Soviet political system, the ownership
of property and strengthening the Soviet government, the Tass
report said.

<HEAD>Rocker Billy Idol Faces More Surgery to Repair Motorcycle Injuries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spiked-haired rocker Billy Idol, who has
twice undergone surgery to repair a leg mangled in a motorcycle
crash, faces at least one more operation, a hospital spokesman said
Monday.
   Idol was in fair condition at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center after
surgery Sunday, the second operation on his right leg since his
accident a week ago.
   ``There is a least one more surgery scheduled that I know of,''
said spokesman Ron Wise. ``It will probably be done within a week.''
   It wasn't immediately clear what impact the operation would have
on Idol's plans to appear in a film by Oliver Stone on the life of
the Doors' lead singer, Jim Morrison. Filming is to begin next
month, and Idol was to play the late rock star's best friend.
   Idol's publicist, Ellen Golden, said it would likely be several
days before Idol knows if he'll be able to go ahead with the movie
and a concert tour this summer.
   She said Idol remains in good spirits and spent much of the
weekend listening to the album he completed just before the
accident.
   She said actor Jack Nicholson, rocker Eric Clapton and comedian
Don Rickles have sent Idol gifts or get-well wishes.
   Sunday's operation was to repair muscle damage. Skin graft
surgery was also to be performed, but because of the complexity of
the muscle repair work, doctors decided to postpone that part of
the work, Wise said.
   ``This is not like tripping over a pair of roller skates and
fracturing your ankle on the back stairs, which can be bad enough.
This is a very serious break he sustained,'' Wise said.
   Wise declined to speculate on how much longer the British star
would be hospitalized or how much rehabilitation he would require.
On Idol's side, he said, is good health and upbeat attitude.
   ``He's young, he's strong. He has been an excellent patient,''
Wise said. ``Everyone who has worked with him has been enormously
impressed by his character and how cooperative he is. He's
generally won a lot friends around the medical center.''
   Idol, 34, underwent his first operation immediately after
Tuesday's crash.
   Police said he ran a stop sign and sideswiped a car while
driving home from a studio where he had just completed work on the
album ``Charmed Life,'' which is to be released April 17.

<HEAD>Rebels Claim Sinking Nine Ships, Capturing 46 Tanks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eritrean rebels said Monday they sank nine
Navy vessels and captured 46 tanks in three assaults on the Red Sea
port of Massawa in northern Ethiopia.
   The Eritrean People's Liberation Front said 21 crew and a large
but unspecified number of army personnel also were taken prisoner
during the siege.
   The rebels said ``fierce'' fighting was continuing in a separate
attack they launched Sunday east of Karan, 55 miles west of Massawa.
   It was not possible to independently confirm the rebel claims
made in a statement issued in Khartoum, Sudan, where the Eritrean
Front maintains an office.
   In Addis Ababa, the government issued no more information on the
fighting after saying Sunday its troops and the rebels were
battling for control of Massawa.
   However, the government did not directly deny a Saturday night
claim by the rebels that they had captured Massawa, one of the
country's only two ports.
   The rebel statement Monday said government troops were
withdrawing from the city but made no mention of whether they were
being evacuated by sea or were fleeing into the arid countryside.
   In their Saturday broadcast, the rebels claimed to have seized
control of the 40-mile road that connects Massawa and Eritrea's
capital, Asmara.
   If the rebel claim is true, Asmara would be virtually cut off
from Addis Ababa except by air. Another rebel group, the Tigre
People's Liberation Front, cut the southern road to Addis Ababa
more than a year ago.
   The Eritrean Front did not specify the types of nine vessels
sunk or tanks captured, but the London-based International
Institute of Strategic Studies says Ethiopia has two frigates and
21 patrol craft, some carrying missiles and torpedoes.
   The rebels are known to have speedboats with cannons and machine
guns.
   The Eritrean Front offensive began Thursday after a lull lasting
nearly a year. Late last year, the rebels held peace talks in
Atlanta and Nairobi, with former President Carter mediating.
   Both parties agreed to meet again and seek an end to the
28-year-old war, Africa's longest, but set no dates.
   The renewed fighting around Massawa effectively halted relief
operations by the United Nations, which hoped to ship most of
700,000 tons of food through the port in the next few months to
northern drought victims, mainly in Eritrea and its southern
neighbor, Tigre.
   The Eritrean offensive came as the government appeared to be
regaining ground the Tigrean rebels captured when they swept out of
their strongholds in Tigre in late August and moved south and west
into Wollo, Showa and Gonder provinces.
   The Tigre and Eritrean Fronts have different goals, but have
coordinated their attacks in the past. The Eritreans want
independence for their province while the Tigreans seek President
Mengistu Haile Mariam's ouster and the establishment of a
government patterned after that of Albania, the last hard-line
Marxist state in Eastern Europe.
   Most of Ethiopia's soldiers are poorly paid conscripts who are
often shipped to front lines with little training. The army
suffered a leadership crisis last May with the arrest of virtually
all top commanders following an abortive coup against Mengistu.

<HEAD>Bush Concerned About Reports of Chinese Restrictions on Students</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Bush Rdp</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush expressed concern Monday about
reports of new restrictions China is imposing on students who want
to study abroad.
   ``I thought that was counterproductive, very much so,'' Bush
said at a news conference that dealt with a wide-ranging array of
topics.
   China is requiring students to spend five years working in China
or to pay large sums of money to the government as a deposit before
they go abroad.
   The Chinese State Education Commission, in promulgating the
rules recently, said it was acting to ensure that students return
home rather than staying abroad once their education is complete.
   Bush said he was disturbed by reports of the move.
   ``I feel that student exchanges are very good things to have
between our countries,'' Bush said. ``I know that some visas have
recently been given to students, so I'd want to check the statement
against the reality.''
   Bush last month won a veto battle with Congress over legislation
that would have guaranteed visa rights for Chinese students now in
this country who are afraid to return home.
   Bush said no Chinese student who fears recriminations at home
will be deported, but he said passage of the legislation would have
antagonized Chinese leaders and could possibly have erson, the
longest-held Western hostage, ``we are at a loss to understand''
why he is being held.
   ``As all governments have made clear that they are not prepared
to barter his release, we urge all those who have any influence
with his captors to join in urging his release,'' the commission, a
private organization, said in a statement.
   The call by the Geneva-based commission coincided with a trip to
Geneva by Peggy Say, Anderson's sister, who has long campaigned on
his behalf.
   Her meetings with international organizations launched a
three-week tour of Europe and the Middle East for talks with global
leaders in a new effort to win his release.
   The jurists' commission, winner of several international human
rights awards, appealed ``on humanitarian grounds to those who are
holding him to set him free.''
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated
Press, was kidnapped on a Beirut street March 16, 1985. Like most
of the 17 other Western hostages in Lebanon, he is believed to be
held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists.
   The International Commission of Jurists appeal also urged
freedom for all other hostages in Lebanon. It specifically
mentioned the latest two, Emanuel Christen and Elio Enrique, health
professionals working for the all-Swiss International Committee of
the Red Cross, who were kidnapped last October.
   ``My heart goes out to the families of the Swiss hostages,''
said Say, of Cadiz, Ky. ``I know they share our sense of outrage
and frustration.''
   Say held talks Monday with International Commission of Jurists
and Red Cross officials. She also met Morris Abram, the U.S.
ambassador to the U.N. Human Rights Commission and other
international bodies in Geneva.
   She next meets Pope John Paul II in the Vatican on Wednesday,
continuing what she calls a ``journey of peace, reconciliation and
hope.''
   Say also will also be visiting the archbishop of Canterbury,
Robert Runcie, in London; the European Parliament's Committee on
Human Rights in Strasbourg, France; and U.N. Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization director Federico Mayor in
Paris.
   She said she also hopes to see Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and Iranian leaders.
   Iranian officials have not responded to efforts to arrange a
meeting. Sheikh Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah, the spiritual head of
Hezbollah, believed to be an umbrella group for Shiite Moslem
kidnappers, refused to meet outside Lebanon.
   Say, who has traveled widely to seek her brother's release, is
being accompanied by her husband and AP executives.

<HEAD>WASHN: peaceful reunification.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   And so, I don't want to buy into any real hypothesis on what
might happen, but I think we ought to applaud the fact that the
Soviets demonstrated a real flexibility on this question, that we
didn't think they had a few months ago.
   Q: Can I just follow? Do you now think, then, that German
reunification is unstoppable and that Gorbachev will back-off his
demand?
   Bush: Well, I think again I'd just refer it to the will of the
people there, and it seems to be moving very fast in that direction.
   Q: So what is your visceral reaction to the resignation of Ariel
Sharon and its effect on the peace process? And is this part of a
pattern of the hardliners losing out around the world?
   Bush: You know, I just heard about this, and I have to
understand more about what went on there. But Mr. Shamir was a
proponent of these talks, and if this clears the way for the talks
to go forward, that would be in keeping with U.S. policy.
   Q: When you talked with Mr. De Klerk and Mr. Mandela, did you
talk about democracy and freedom, did you make the point that in
our understanding of democracy the majority rules?
   Bush: We didn't go in _ yeah _
   Q: I especially was wondering about De Klerk. Or will you talk
with him about that when he comes?
   Bush: I am sure we will, and with Mr. Mandela _ but that did not
come up in these conversations; none o the detail here on the
various sanctions or anything of that nature came up.
   Q: Is that what you would tell him? It's De Klerk I'm speaking
of.
   Bush: Well, let's wait and see what happens when he gets here.
   Q: Sir, we have a big problem in this country with the bases
that we have being closed and the tens of thousands of personnel we
have to let go out of the military and out of the civilian roles,
too. I wonder if you would be for taking these military bases and
turning them into prisons rather than building new prisons and if
you'd be for using the extra housing for the homeless?
   Bush: Well, Sarah, let me say this, that when military bases
close, various communities, historically, seem to prosper. And I
think of one in Waco, Texas where a base was closed, it was, oh,
years ago _ all kinds of speculation that this would be the end of
the world, and then gradually found out that it doesn't work that
way. And so, I think there will be socially redeeming uses for
these benefits that municipalities and county governments and
others may _ these bases that these entities may want to use them
for. And so, I would say that it's a good question because we can
say to others, this is not the end of the world. But let me say on
base closings, I _ these suggested closings were made without
political favor and I would hope that we could get the Congress
convinced that the age-old adage, ``Cut here, cut there, but don't
cut in my district'' could be laid aside now. And I hope that
that's what will prevail. I said out there in San Francisco that
instant doves become feathery instant hawks on base closings if
only it's in their district. And I want to see that change, and
I've got to convince these folks that we are not doing this in some
vindictive political way. We're doing it to try to accommodate to
what will be a new kind of defense force in this country.
   Q: Mr. President, I wonder if you could clarify your position on
your hopes for the June summit. Is it your view that it may be
possible there, if not necessarily to sign formal treaties, but to
substantially complete the CFE and the START and even maybe the
chemical _
   Bush: Chemical. I'd hope we'd be substantially completed is a
good way to phrase it.
   Q: You _ your assistant secretary for Africa seems to suggest
that some sort of gestures were now needed toward South Africa. Has
there been any discussion of that, or have you pretty much ruled it
out, any concrete move, until the state of emergency is lifted?
   Bush: Well, we have certain provisions in the law that have to
be met. But I would hope people would see the invitation to Mr. De
Klerk as a _ certainly as a gesture _ but one that will have, after
the discussions with him, I think considerable more substance, too.
   Q: Can you support a situation back to Germany where there is
membership, let's say political membership in NATO, but not a
military relationship that exists now, with the possibility of no
foreign troops on German soil and a unified Germany?
   Bush: I don't think we're contemplating a neutralized Germany,
and I have stated my position in terms of the Alliance. And that's
the way we view it, and I'm sure that's the way our allies look at
it.
   Q: Could I ask how, since you had mentioned that unification is
a matter to be left to the German people, if there were some
referendum where they wanted a configuration without foreign troops
on German soil, how would you deal with it?
   Bush: I would cross that bridge when I came to it, but I would
point out that Helmut Kohl, to his credit, is not considering that.
   Q: Mr. President, in a different hemisphere. Over the past
couple of months when asked why you're going to Cartagena this
week, you've said want to show support for the government down
there. Now as you're just a couple of days away, do you expect to
do anything more than that _ than show the flag? Do you expect
anything concrete to come out of it; perhaps increased use of
military down there?

<HEAD>Manhunt for Five Escapees Focuses on Chicago</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOLIET, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A manhunt for five men, including three
convicted murderers, who escaped from a maximum-security state
prison focused on the Chicago area Monday.
   A sixth escapee was captured late Sunday near his cousin's home
in Chicago, and the five still at large _ described as extremely
dangerous _ were believed to have also headed for the city, said
corrections spokesman Nic Howell.
   The inmates, who escaped Sunday from the Joliet Correctional
Facility, may have ties to Chicago or may simply hope to lose
themselves in the large metropolitan area, he said.
   ``We have no reason to think that these guys are out of state or
are not in the general vicinity of Chicago,'' Howell said. But
authorities have no specific leads, he said, noting the recaptured
inmate had provided little information.
   ``Nothing has panned out yet,'' Howell said.
   Early Sunday morning, the inmates apparently cut through bars on
their cells, broke a window and cut through bars outside it, then
climbed a low fence and fled the northern Illinois prison
undetected, Howell said.
   About 100 corrections officers and officials were involved in
the case _ either helping with the search or the internal
investigation and security review at the prison.
   The prison houses 1,300 inmates, 500 more than it was intended
to hold, but Howell said he didn't know if the crowded conditions
contributed to the escape.
   The six prisoners were last accounted for at 4:55 a.m. Sunday.
The escape was discovered when a headcount came up short at 7 a.m.,
Howell said.
   The men escaped from segregation cells, where they were being
kept because of disciplinary problems, he said. Four of the men
were doubled up, two to a cell, and the other two were alone in
their cells.
   Tommy Munoz of Chicago was captured just after 5:30 p.m. Sunday
by prison authorities who had staked out his cousin's house on the
city's Southwest Side, about 40 miles east of the prison, Howell
said.
   Munoz was returned to the Joliet, where he was serving a
two-year sentence for narcotics violations and intimidation, the
spokesman said.
   Still at large were:
   _Daniel Johnson, 24, of Burns, Tenn., imprisoned for murder.
   _James F. Allen, 40, of Chicago, imprisoned for three murders.
   _Dave Rodriguez, 21, of Chicago, imprisoned for murder.
   _Terry W. Colburn, 21, of Bloomington, imprisoned for burglary.
   _Ronald Roach, in his 20s, of Wyoming, Ill., imprisoned for
burglary.

<HEAD>Family of Former Celtics Owner Gets $5 Million Malpractice Verdict</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The family of Robert Schmertz, a former owner of
the Boston Celtics basketball team, has been awarded more than $5
million because of Schmertz's death due to negligence following
brain surgery.
   Almost 13 years after the malpractice lawsuit was filed, a jury
in Manhattan's State Supreme Court awarded $4 million to Schmertz's
widow, Phyllis, who lives in Florida.
   The jury also awarded $500,000 to each of his two mentally
handicapped children, Ronald and Jane, who live at the Woods School
in Langhorne, Pa., and it gave $50,000 to his third child, Nancy,
who lives in Manhattan. The children are Schmertz's from a previous
marriage.
   The award will be paid by Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital, where
Schmertz, 48, had surgery July 15, 1975, for cranial bleeding due
to a congenital condition, said Steve Mangione, spokesman for
Schmertz's lawyer, Thomas Moore.
   The hospital's lawyer, Luke Pittoni, could not be reached for
comment Monday, but Mangione said hospital lawyers said they would
appeal the verdict.
   Schmertz's operation was a success, but the jury found that the
anesthesiologist, Dr. Richard Matteo, and others were negligent
because they failed to monitor Schmertz's heart and breathing
properly in the recovery room, Mangione said.
   Shortly after entering the recovery room, Mangione said,
Schmertz vomited and aspirated the vomit into his lungs, further
compromising his breathing. He lapsed into a coma and died July 23,
eight days later, Mangione said.
   The hospital said it was unable to produce records and X-rays
that documented what happened to Schmertz, Mangione said.
   He said Moore felt it was ``more than a coincidence that the two
crucial X-rays and the documentation were missing.''
   However, on the eve of the trial, Columbia-Presbyterian brought
in a videotape of the Schmertz operation, which the hospital said
would show that the surgeon, James MacMurtrey, caused Schmertz's
death, Mangione said.
   But Moore observed that the hospital had been using that video
for 13 years to instruct surgical residents in how to perform
correctly the procedure done on Schmertz.
   MacMurtrey was eventually removed from the case as a defendant.
   The jury ruled Friday following a three-week trial and two days
of deliberations.
   Schmertz owned the Celtics from 1972 to 1975, Mangione said. He
was also a part owner of the Hartford Whalers and a co-founder of
the now-defunct USFL.

   Honey production dropped 21 percent last year
to 169 million pounds, the Agriculture Department said Monday.
   About 3.3 million colonies produced honey in 1989, a 3 percent
increase from 1988, according to the annual report. But the average
yield per colony was only 51.1 pounds, down from 66.3 pounds in
1988.
   ``Adverse conditions were encountered in most states and
included wet weather, restrictions on movement early in the year,
dry weather, disease and mite infestations throughout the year,''
the report said.
   Price for the 1989 crop averaged 48.4 cents per pound, down 1.6
cents from 1988, the report said.

<HEAD>Dairy Group Says Bush Plan Could Be Hard on Farmers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A national dairy organization said Monday the
Bush administration's farm bill proposals would mean hardships for
milk producers and consumers.
   The Bush proposal announced last week would continue the
Agriculture Department's current basic milk price support formula
but also seeks more flexibility in adjusting supports in line with
market conditions.
   ``This plan would only create more instability in the dairy
industry, with wilder swings in consumer prices and the loss of
dairy farmers throughout the country,'' said Tom Camerlo, president
of the National Milk Producers Federation.
   Camerlo said in the federation's newsletter that the plan
amounts to ``even more and deeper price cuts'' for dairy farmers
than allowed by the current law.

<TEXT>
   Bush: Well, I do think that we want to support Mr. Barco, a
courageous leader. And I think going there will certainly indicate
how strongly I feel about that. But I think there will be more than
that come out of it. I hope we can get agreement in terms of
support for the anti-narcotics efforts in these three countries:
Peru, Bolivia and Colombia.
   What was the last part?
   Q: Anything in particular, like the increased use of the
military, the plan that seemed to have been scuttled earlier to use
U.S. warships off the coast of Colombia?
   Bush: Well, what happened on that plan was some mischievous
stories that suggested blockade. So, one of the things I'll try to
do _ because there was never any intention of a blockade.
Absolutely absurd. And yet that threw a panic amongst many of the
Colombians who said, ``We don't want a blockade off our coast.''
And that wasn't what ever had been intended. But in terms of
interdiction, what I'd like to convince them is that we can be
extraordinarily helpful, particularly to Colombia, in their
courageous fight against narco-traffickers by a sophisticated
interdiction effort.
   Q: Mr. President, on the same subject. Some observers and some
headlines recently have talked about we're winning the war on
drugs, and I believe your last statement, you said, ``We're just
starting on the war on drugs.''
   Bush: Starting to win.
   Q: We're starting to win.
   Bush: Combine the two statements. We'll meld them.
   Q: What, as you head for the drug summit, what will you tell the
other leaders about the status of the war on drugs in this country?
   Bush: I'll tell _ one of the points I'll emphasize at the
beginning is: Look, I know you three leaders think that this is all
the fault _ not entirely _ but a lot of the fault because of the
demand in the United States. And let me assure you we're not just
talking about interdiction. We're not just talking about anti-crime
aspects of this in the United States. We're talking about major
efforts on the demand side, a major initiative. And a lot of it _
most of it is out in the private sector, in the schools, to educate
people against the use of narcotics. Because they think that it's
all _ that the United States is causing all this problem.
   It's changed a little bit, because some of them are beginning to
see user problems inside their own countries or neighboring
countries or countries that have crossed the ocean even. So, I
think we've got to convince them that we are going out on all
fronts, and I think I can do that.
   Q: As a follow-up, sir. They're, from what we've have heard,
going to ask you for more money for crop substitution, to
substitute other goods for the coca crop down there. Will the U.S.
put its money where it's mouth is on that?
   Bush: Well, we'll listen to what they have to say on it, but
they should _ ought not to be condoning the growth of crops that
are illegal in some areas, and certainly crops that are clearly
used in the cocaine trade. And so that's a moral question. I'd try
to put it on that kind of emphasis, and then see what we can do
over here in terms of trying to help financially.
   Q: You said that Eastern European countries want the Soviet
troops to leave, and you've also pointed to the progress in talks
about conventional force reductions, but the fact of the matter is
virtually all those Soviet troops are still there now in Eastern
Europe.
   Bush: Yes.
   Q: Can you point to any real progress on the ground in terms of
any changes in Soviet troop deployments in Eastern Europe? And to
what extent do you see the continued threat for reversals,
politically, inside the East Bloc that could cause those troops to
continue to be deployed?
   Bush: To be wanted? I can't see a political change inside the
Eastern European countries that would have an invitation go out to
please remain. I don't see any politics, or any political changes
that would make me think that that is a likely _ a likely scenario
right now. But _ and I do think that you put your finger on
something, they have not I don't know, I was looking for Brent to
see if any have been pulled back at all.
   Gen. Brent Scowcroft: Yes, they have.
   Bush: And he says some have, so we'll have to get you the
information on exactly what withdrawals have taken place.
   Q:Mr. President, do you have a date for the summit with Mr.
Gorbachev yet?
   Bush: I don't think we've set the exact date.
   Q: Mr. President, when you won the China veto vote, you said
there were signs things were easing up in Beijing. Now they say
they want, before students can leave the country to study abroad,
they'll have to spend five years at work. Isn't this backsliding?
Or is there some evidence that you have that things are easing up
in China?
   Bush: Well, I'm disturbed by that statement, I don't like that
statement, because I feel that student exchanges are very good
things to have between our countries. I know that some visas have
recently been given to students, so I'd want to check the statement
against the reality. I know that some students over there have been
issued visas to come to the United States. But I saw the statement,
and if you just want me to comment on the statement, I thought that
was counterproductive _ very much so.
   Q: Mr. President, has the current oil spill in Southern
California in any way changed your thinking about the wisdom of
further development of offshore oil lease sales? And what is your
timetable for when you're going to make the decision on those lease
sales?

   The number of workers employed by farmers
declined seasonally in January and was down about 2 percent from a
year earlier, the Agriculture Department said Monday.
   A quarterly report said the hired work force on farms was
estimated at 690,000 during the week of Jan. 7-13, down from
983,000 in October. A year ago in January, the work force was
701,000.
   Those did not include 143,000 ``agricultural service'' workers
provided by crew chiefs and labor contractors. In October, those
totaled 308,000 workers, and in January 1989 they were estimated at
152,000.
   Mostly dry weather and above-normal temperatures prevailed
across the nation during the Jan. 7-13 survey week, the report said.
   The report said the national figures for hired workers had a
sampling error of 3.7 percent.
   Average pay for all workers hired directly by farmers was
reported at $5.70 per hour, up from $5.42 in October and $5.51 a
year ago, the report said.
   For workers hired by contractors, there was no national wage
rate available. However, workers in California were reported at
$6.20 per hour, compared with $6.41 in October and $6.42 a year
ago. Florida workers averaged $6.23 per hour, compared with $5.15
in October and $5.79 a year earlier.

   Boxer Buster Douglas returned home to a hero's welcome Monday,
greeted by hundreds of fans who wanted to see the man who surprised
heavyweight champion Mike Tyson in Tokyo, while Tyson's homecoming
was more subdued.
   When Douglas left Columbus, Ohio, and headed for Tokyo to fight
Tyson, he left in obscurity. Hardly anyone noticed or cared. But he
was met by a cheering crowd when his plane landed Monday.
   His grandmother, Sarah Jones, stepped to a microphone, held the
World Boxing Council belt high in the air and said: ``We did it,
Columbus, we got it. And now we're going to keep it.''
   The crowd cheered. Douglas was introduced by his manager, John
Johnson, and the crowd cheered again.
   Douglas, 29, shocked the boxing world Sunday with his 10th-round
knockout of Tyson, who went down to his first defeat in 38 fights.
   But two of boxing's three governing bodies suspended Douglas'
victory, pending review of film to determine if Douglas received a
long count when Tyson knocked him down in the eighth round.
   The International Boxing Federation said it recognized Douglas
as the champion, but the World Boxing Council and the World Boxing
Association suspended the result pending their investigation. They
could order a rematch.
   In New York, fans called out ``you're still the champ, Mike,''
when Tyson and promoter Don King arrived at JFK Airport.
   ``I had a pretty bad performance but I'm not going to make
excuses,'' Tyson said. ``I'm just going to go on and make better
results.''
   ``I've lost before,'' he said, referring to fights during his
amateur career. ``It's no big deal. I've always come back from a
loss. I feel great. I have a slight swelling in my eye and as soon
as it goes down, I'm ready to go back to training.''
   Douglas said he wants to take on undefeated Evander Holyfield.
   ``Evander Holyfield's the No. 1 contender, and he would be the
next opponent,'' he told reporters.
   Tyson's loss torpedoed plans for a big money, pay-per-view title
defense against Holyfield in June. Tyson stood to make at least $25
million by fighting Holyfield, and Holyfield at least $12 million.
Douglas got $1.3 million for Sunday's fight.
   Lou Duva, Holyfield's manager, was in the crowd that met Tyson
at the airport.
   ``When Tyson walked into the ring, I could see something was
wrong,'' Duva said. ``He had no life. He didn't have that drive.
He's not the fighter he was with Kevin Rooney.''
   Tyson dismissed Rooney as his trainer a year ago. The Douglas
bout on Sunday was his third title defense without Rooney in his
corner.
   Johnson said he discussed with Mayor Dana Rinehart the
possibility of having Johnson-Holyfield fight at Ohio Stadium, home
of the Ohio State football team in Columbus.
   After the airport, Douglas was greeted by about 500 pupils of
the Windsor Alternative School, where his son, Lamar, is a
fifth-grader.
   A parade was scheduled for Wednesday morning in Columbus.

   President Bush said Monday that he hasn't
decided whether to open new tracts off California and Florida to
oil drilling, but he defended offshore-well safety and said the
country needs oil.
   ``I have said that we're not going to have drilling in highly
environmentally sensitive places. But I'll be darned if I think we
ought to shut down all offshore drilling everywhere,'' Bush said at
a news conference.
   He questioned the logic of drilling opponents in California who
believe their case was bolstered by last week's oil spill off
Huntington Beach when a tanker's anchor gashed a hole in its side.
   ``A freighter or tanker has a hole punched in it and I see a
whole bunch of guys jumping up and down saying this proves you
can't have any offshore drilling,'' said Bush, a former oilman.
``I'm not sure I understand the connection.
   ``I don't see that a spill from a tanker really has much to do
with whether you can drill an offshore well safely, because it's
going on all the time.
   ``This country depends on it. We depend on offshore oil ...
domestically for our own energy requirements,'' he said. ``It
reinforces my view that we've got to be very careful about leasing
in sensitive areas, even though there's no connection between a
tanker spill and a drilling of a well.''
   Bush said he had read the recommendations of an administration
task force on whether to lift the moratorium on drilling in
sensitive tracts off the coast of California and Florida and that
his decision would come ``fairly soon.''

   Bush: You know, I saw somebody _ a freighter or tanker has a
hole punched in it, and I see a bunch of guys jumping up and down
saying, ``This proves you can't have any offshore drilling.'' I'm
saying to myself, I'm not sure I understand the connection between
tankers _ do they want to cut off all tankers? Or do we just want
to do our level best to make tankering safer? I have said that
we're not going to have drilling in highly environmentally
sensitive places, but I'll be darned if I think we ought to shut
down all offshore drilling everywhere.
   And I don't see that that _ that a spill from a tanker really
has much to do with whether you can drill an offshore well safely,
because it's going on all the time. And this country depends on it
_ we depend a lot on offshore oil in _ domestically, for our own _
for our own energy requirements. But, I tell you what it does do,
it reinforces my view that we've got to be very careful about
leasing in sensitive areas, even though there's no connection
between a tanker spill and a drilling of a well.
   Q: But when do you plan to make your decision on those lease
sales?
   Bush: Fairly soon. I've read the recommendations and the report.
It should be fairly soon.
   Q: Mr. President, did Mr. Mandela and Mr. De Klerk accept your
invitations? And if so, when are they coming?
   Bush: I felt _ I have to go back and look at my notes _ but I
felt they accepted in principle, both of them. I think Mr. Mandela
said he wanted to talk _ I thought he said to his Executive Council
or something. But anyway, he had to _ he wanted to talk to some
others; that came first, you know, right out of the first few
hours. I must say, he seemed very pleased at that, and I think Mr.
De Klerk the same way. But there isn't _ there wasn't any time set
on either of those invitations.
   Q: Mr. President, is this the time to re-examine the flexible
response doctrine of NATO, and particularly the wisdom of
continuing work on the Lance missile?
   Bush: Well, that decision will not be taken until 1992; that was
an agreement between all the NATO partners. And I see nothing to
change that at this point.
   Q: But could I just follow up? How can you, under current
circumstances, justify deployment of the Lance which would hit with
nuclear warheads East Germany, perhaps Poland and Czechoslovakia?
   Bush: If you have these dramatic changes get effected, then you
take a look at all these considerations. That's what I'd say.
   Q: You spoke a lot about troop cuts, but nobody is explaining
how these soldiers would physically _ how tens of thousands of
soldiers would physically be removed from the armed services. What
are your suggestions?
   Bush: I was talking to Marlin when I should have been listening,
excuse me. What was your question? The first part of it.
   Q: A lot of people are talking about troop cuts, but you have
not proposed a way to get several thousand _ lots _ many thousands
of soldiers out of the armed services. How do you propose getting
people out of uniform, force a lot of them into retirement?
   Bush: Well, I tell you, in our defense budget, we did propose
reductions. They'll come up over the years, not necessarily all at
once _ 81,000 troops, two active army divisions, and then some _
two battleships, 14 B-52s, all of which have personnel with them,
M-1 tanks, Maverick missiles, sea launch system, Apache helicopter.
Several different systems that will eventually result in lower
personnel. Maybe I'm missing the question.
   Q: You're only talking about reducing forces by attrition?
   Bush: Oh, I would hope a lot of it could be done by attrition,
because of the highly trained, dedicated men and women in the air _
in the armed forces. I would hope a lot could. You have high _ you
know, relatively high attrition rates, in spite of pretty good
retention, but there's still attrition. And I would like to think
that a kid that went in to make a career out of this would not be
unceremoniously dumped from the armed services.
   No, that's a good point, but I'd _ and I'd hope _ I would hope
that attrition can take care of the cuts that inevitably will be
coming.
   I'm told by Marlin that this has got to be the last one.
   Q: Mr. President, what role did anti-apartheid demonstrations in
this country play in the release of Nelson Mandela and other
political prisoners?
   Bush: I don't know, because you had anti-apartheid
demonstrations in many countries. So I think _ I think if people
get the feeling in South Africa that apartheid itself is abhorrent
to the United States, through whatever way they get that feeling _
whether it's a statement by the President, whether it's some
legislative action, or whether it's some demonstration _ that's
helpful. But I can't help you on how you would quantify that.

   Toy sales should grow moderately this year,
industry officials forecast Monday, as the business builds on
1989's momentum and traditional American toymakers learn to cope
with the video game craze.
   Industry officials provided the outlook on the opening day of
annual American International Toy Fair, which started its 10-day
run amid a bevy of colorful characters aimed at catching the
attention of an estimated 20,000 buyers from stores around the
country and abroad.
   A pair of jumbo, ruby-red lips, perched atop a woman's body,
sashayed on the Fifth Avenue sidewalk plugging a new game called
Read My Lips.
   Nearby, a model in a scanty mermaid costume shivered as she
hawked a new line of children's clothing to visitors entering the
show, many of whom were chomping pizza courtesy of a Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtle.
   Activists protesting war toys got some good news: The industry
reported sales of make-believe guns, weapons and accessories fell
last year by 12.5 percent.
   Models Christie Brinkley, Beverly Johnson and Cheryl Tiegs posed
for photographers at the Matchbox Toys (USA) Ltd. showroom. The
company's Real Model Collection has three dolls modeled after the
glamorous trio, with some of the sales proceeds earmarked for
charity.
   At the Tyco Toys showroom, 7-year-old quintuplets Ben, Julie,
Kristi, Kari and Jami Chikaraishi helped the company introduce a
new Quints line of small dolls, five to a set.
   Police were called in to control a crowd of young fans outside
the Hasbro Inc. building where the New Kids on the Block appeared
to pitch dolls based on the singing group.
   Such promotions are commonplace at Toy Fair, where each year
thousands of toys make their debut. Many, many will never make it
to store shelves.
   Amid the publicity stunts, the industry reported business
improved moderately in 1989. Similar results are expected this
year, depending on whether video games lose some of their following.
   Jack Stoneman, chairman of the Toy Manufacturers of America
Inc., sponsors of the trade show, said retail toy sales totaled
about $13.4 billion in 1989, up from $12.75 billion in 1988. The
association's figures don't include the $3 billion or so pulled in
by video games last year.
   This year's retail toy sales will rise by 4 percent to 6
percent, Stoneman told a news conference.
   Competing with video games has been one of the biggest
challenges for toymakers.
   Some of them have taken an if-you-can't-beat-them-join-them
approach by offering software and accessories for use with the
Nintendo Entertainment System and other machines. Companies also
are emphasizing lower-priced toys to attract dollars left over
after video game purchases.
   Association officials and company executives were reluctant to
speculate on whether the video game boom would end soon.
   Alan G. Hassenfeld, chairman and chief executive officer of
Hasbro, the country's largest toy company, said the industry has
adapted.
   ``All of us are learning to co-exist with video games,'' he said
in an interview. ``The cold war is over with video.''
   Meanwhile, the toy industry is looking to Europe as a possibly
lucrative market. But prospects for business in Eastern Europe are
unclear.
   Stoneman, speaking at the news conference, said: ``Eastern
Europe ... now presents all of us with a unique set of
opportunities. The potential for growth there is simply
staggering.''
   Hassenfeld of Hasbro, however, said cultivating the East
European market would take time and the first step will be the
establishment of factories in countries there to support economic

   While Europe overall ``has fabulous growth potential,''
Hassenfeld said, ``the Eastern European market I think is a
different story. I think there is honestly too much being written
on the Eastern European market and its potential.''

<HEAD>Experts Discuss Effect of Bush Drug Plan</HEAD>

   A congressional international affairs expert
on Monday described President Bush's Andean drug initiative as a
``major turning point'' in U.S. drug policy, but a specialist in
the region said the policy is doomed to failure unless attention is
paid to the needs of coca-growing peasants.
   Raphael Francis Perl, a specialist in international affairs with
the Congressional Research Service of the Library of Congress, said
the Bush initiative, calling for $2.2 billion in aid to countries
in the region over five years, ``represents an increased awareness
of the economic and trade component'' of drug policy.
   Kevin Healy, Inter-American Foundation representative for
Bolivia and Ecuador, on the other hand, said, ``We have had
economic aid and crop-substitution programs going on in Bolivia
since 1976. If they are implemented with the same ... kind of
understanding of the peasant economy and the national agricultural
problems, I think they are doomed to fail.''
   ``I think we have got to go in and get serious about, not
economic development, but peasant economic development, putting the
emphasis there. We have had economic development before, but it
seldom gets through to the peasantry. I'm sort of a disbeliever
until I can see that it's not just business as usual in foreign
aid.''
   Perl and Healy spoke at a briefing called by the Panos Institute
in connection with this week's drug summit in Cartagena, Colombia.
The organization, founded in 1986, primarily by environmental
journalists, describes itself as ``an independent, international
institute working for sustainable development.'' Its sources of
funds include the governments of Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands,
Norway, Sweden and Britain, as well as international organizations
and the Ford and Rockefeller foundations.
   A study distributed at the briefing said no approach to the drug
crisis is likely to succeed unless it deals with the problems of
farmers who grow the coca leaves from which cocaine is made.
   The study by Patricia Ardila, a Colombian magazine journalist
who is director of the institute's Narcotics and Development
Information program, said, ``Cocaine money plays a vital role in
helping to cushion the economic crisis facing Bolivia and Peru, due
to debt and structural adjustment, and in contributing to
Colombia's healthier economic performance.''
   At the same time, the study, said, ``traditional or new elites
are amassing immense fortunes through cocaine trafficking'' and
``helping to reinforce the inequalities that have prevailed in
these countries for centuries.''
   ``The illegal nature of these economic activities, which makes
violence the chief means used by traffickers to regulate the
cocaine business, combined with the international response to the
drug trade, which has overlooked the issues of poverty and
underdevelopment facing coca producers, is occurring at enormous
cost to the Andean countries,'' Ms. Ardila said.
   ``Whatever solutions are proposed, chances are that none are
likely to succeed unless coca producers can participate in all
stages of the process, to ensure that their economic and social
needs are met,'' she wrote.
   Perl, whose duties include advising members of Congress on
international drug control, said, ``There is no question that the
U.S. invasion of Panama has placed significant obstacles to drug
policy in the short term.''
   He said that on a recent trip to Peru he expected people to ask
him about drugs, but most of the questions he got were about the
U.S. invasion that resulted in the arrest of Panamanian Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   In the long run, however, Perl said he is more hopeful about
prospects for U.S. drug policy in the region.
   ``I believe that the Bush initiative represents a major turning
point in U.S. international narcotics control policy,'' he said.

<HEAD>Chirac Re-Elected Leader of France's Neo-Gaullist Party</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Premier Jacques Chirac has been re-elected
to head France's main conservative party, the neo-Gaullist Rally
for the Republic, but political analysts expect challenges to his
leadership will persist.
   A motion by Chirac supporters obtained two-thirds of the vote at
a party convention Sunday against an insurrectionist motion
advanced by two men who served as Cabinet ministers under Chirac,
Philippe Seguin and Charles Pasqua.
   Chirac, 57, who is also mayor of Paris, then was re-elected by a
unanimous vote for a three-year term. He had threatened to resign
if his motion lost.
   Seguin leads a reform movement within the party's left wing and
Pasqua heads the right wing. Pasqua has urged the party to compete
with the extreme-right National Front for votes. Seguin wants the
party to lure centrist supporters.
   Chirac said after his victory that the party, which he created
in 1976 and has dominated ever since, would emerge from weeks of
conflict ``strengthened and enlarged'' and ready to fight the next
legislative elections in 1993.
   But newspaper commentators said Monday that by capturing almost
a third of the vote with their motion, Seguin and Pasqua showed
strong opposition to Chirac existed in the party.
   They said the initiative now may pass to a more serious
challenger to Chirac's authority, Michel Noir, mayor of Lyon, who
is expected to launch an initiative to try to form a single
opposition party with the other main right-wing group, the Union of
French Democracy.
   Le Courier de l'Ouest, a provincial daily, said Chirac had
scored a Pyrrhic victory.
   The paper said, ``It is unlikely that Pasqua and Seguin will
give up ... and Chirac risks another battle with Michel Noir. (His)
problems are only just beginning.''
   Chirac served as premier from 1974-76 and from 1986-88 and
failed in two runs at the presidency. He has been notably quiet
since his May 1988 defeat at the hands of incumbent Socialist
President Francois Mitterrand.
   In issuing their challenge Jan. 10, Seguin and Pasqua said the
party ``has not recovered confidence in itself, and as a result has
never seemed so far away from regaining the confidence of the
French people.'' They did not mention Chirac by name but no one was
fooled.
   ``It's a struggle for power, it involves destablizing Jacques
Chirac and myself,'' said party Secretary-General Alain Juppe, who
also was re-elected Sunday.

<HEAD>Opposition Leader Says It May Pull Out of Ruling Council</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN PETREANU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An opposition leader said Monday that
it will pull out of Romania's new power-sharing government if the
previous interim government continues to ``sabotage free
discussion.''
   ``This would throw the country into political crisis,'' said
Radu Campeanu, president of the National Liberal Party.
   His warning came one day before the ruling Council of National
Unity, which will run the country until elections May 20, meets for
the second time.
   The council last week replaced the National Salvation Front,
which took power during the bloody revolution in December that
toppled Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   The Front was forced to share power with the opposition after
announcing it would, in essence, become a political party and
participate in the elections, reversing an earlier pledge to stay
out of the first free balloting since World War II.
   But opposition leaders say the Front is trying to maintain power
by controlling the new government.
   In a related development Monday, Razvan Teodorescu, a reputed
Front supporter, was appointed to head Romanian national TV and
radio, the national news agency Rompres reported.
   He replaces Aurel Dragos Munteanu, who resigned last week
following almost daily demonstrations by protesters who said he was
too close to the Front and the media was being used as a political
weapon against the opposition.
   Campeanu said in an interview that he was certain his party
would form an alliance with the National Peasants Party _ the
largest of Romania's revived political parties _ to challenge the
Front in the elections.
   A unified opposition would ``crystalize the fact that the Front
is in reality the Communists, and the opposition is the
anti-Communists,'' he said.
   He said he also asked the Social Democratic Party, the third
party in Romania with historic roots, to join the alliance, and
that he had been approached by several smaller, interested parties
as well.
   Campeanu said he expected the parties to reach agreement by the
end of the month.
   Valentin Gabrielescu, spokesman for the Peasants' Party, also
said an alliance was ``very desirable and almost a certainty.''
   Social Democrat Secretary Mira Moscovici said her party, which
is ideologically further left than most of the others, is undecided
on whether it will join. ``Cooperation may be imperative as we are
faced by a totalitarian threat from the Front,'' she added.
   Several opposition leaders have accused the Front of
manipulating the National Unity Council's inaugural meeting Friday
to assure itself of a majority of the 250 seats to vote down the
opposition demand that elections be postponed.
   The opposition wants the election delayed until September to
allow it more time to prepare and to educate Romanians about
multiparty democracy.
   Campeanu said the hall in which Friday's meeting was held also
was packed with boisterous Front supporters invited ``to create
intimidation and sabotage free discussion.''
   He said that ``if this recurs Tuesday, we will quit the Unity
Council and I think we will be joined by all the other political
parties as well.''

<TEXT>
   Sudan and the Central African Republic
announced Monday the resumption of diplomatic ties broken last May.
   The official Sudan News Agency said the announcement came during
an unexpected visit to the Central African Republic capital Bangui
by Lt. Gen. Omar el-Bashir, Sudan's military strongman.
   He met with Andre Kolingba, president of Central African
Republic, and they later issued a joint communique saying the two
neighbors were restoring diplomatic relations, reopening their
borders and resuming air service.
   The two countries severed links May 30 after Sudan, then under
civilian Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi, refused to allow a Central
African plane to cross Sudanese airspace en route to Israel.
   Kolingba was aboard the plane, but Sudan said it had not known
it at the time. It said it was merely following a general Arab ban
on flights heading for Israel.
   A junta led by el-Bashir overthrew el-Mahdi's civilian
administration June 30.

<HEAD>Cold Alaskan Air Heading South</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cold air began forcing its way into the Northwest and the
northern Plains on Monday, threatening snow and sharply lower
temperatures, but it was good news for cold-weary Alaska.
   Alaska has been experiencing severe cold the past couple of
weeks, and a change in the weather pattern across the northern
hemisphere made Alaska's cold air shift toward the Lower 48 states.
   Parts of Alaska experienced rapid warming as the cold air began
leaving, with Nome reporting a temperature rise of 19 degrees in 21
minutes during the morning, from 25 below zero to 6 below zero.
   On the opposite side of the moving air mass, temperatures
dropped during the day in the northern Plains and the northern
Rockies. At midday, Cut Bank, Mont., reported a temperature of just
3 degrees above zero, and strong northerly wind produced a wind
chill reading of 39 below.
   Readings were only in the 20s during the afternoon across parts
of Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan.
   In the Northwest, the cold meant snow.
   A heavy snow warning was issued for elevations above 500 feet in
the coastal mountains of western Oregon, with snow advisories in
effect elsewhere at higher elevations in Oregon and Washington.
   Advisories for snow and blowing snow were posted for the
mountain passes of Montana west of the Continental Divide.
   A winter storm watch was posted for Tuesday for the Nebraska
Panhandle.
   The advancing arctic air was expected to generate windy weather
in Southern California, and a frost advisory was posted for
Wednesday night for agricultural areas around San Diego.
   In the East, a storm early Monday dumped up to 8 inches on parts
of mountainous eastern West Virginia.
   ``It was a pretty impressive show. It had lightning with it. It
was coming down like gangbusters,'' said Jeff Johnson, a spokesman
at the WinterPlace ski resort south of Beckley, which had to close
over the weekend because its snow melted. The new snow was
short-lived _ temperatures climbed into the 40s Monday.
   Elsewhere, gusty southerly wind prevailed from the southern
Plains to the middle Mississippi Valley. Temperatures were in the
70s across the southern Plains and the lower Mississippi Valley,
and in the 60s as far north as Iowa.
   Temperatures also were in the 60s in the Southeast, with 70s
across the Florida Peninsula, and reached the 60s and 70s in
Southern California and southern Arizona.
   Monday's overnight low for the Lower 48 states was 5 below zero
at Caribou, Maine.

<HEAD>Investigators Seek Cause of Theater Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fire gutted the historic Savoy Theater before dawn
Monday, and the adjacent Savoy Hotel was evacuated as a precaution.
There were no injuries, officials said.
   Scotland Yard investigators examined the wreckage to determine
the cause, but police said they did not believe the fire at the
empty theater was suspicious.
   ``There's no evidence at this stage of arson,'' said a Scotland
Yard spokesman, who was not identified, in accordance with British
custom.
   The theater had not been staging a production at the time.
   The Scotland Yard spokesman said the elegant Savoy Hotel
suffered little damage. About 130 guests, including actor Richard
Harris, and 61 employees were evacuated.
   The London fire brigade said 60 percent of the 109-year-old
theater in The Strand in central London was ablaze when
firefighters arrived shortly after 1:30 a.m.
   Flames fanned by strong winds burst through the roof of the
theater and lighted the night sky. Thick smoke brought traffic to a
halt.
   Harris, wearing a white Savoy Hotel dressing gown and sipping
tea as he watched firefighters tackle the blaze, told reporters he
was lying in bed learning lines when he heard the hotel fire alarm.
   The 58-year-old actor said he walked downstairs because he had
been told that in a fire people should not use elevators. ``There
was no panic. It was perfectly organized by the Savoy staff,'' he
said.
   The Savoy Theater, which can seat 1,123 people, was built by
Gilbert and Sullivan impresario Richard D'Oyly Carte in 1881.
   The Savoy Hotel opened in 1889 and swiftly gained a reputation
as one of the world's grandest hotels, often frequented by the rich
and famous. The best suites currently cost about $850 a night.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge Monday delayed the start of
John Poindexter's Iran-Contra trial by two weeks and said former
President Reagan's videotaped testimony would be taken Friday
morning at the federal courthouse in Los Angeles.
   U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene said disagreement over
the use of about 150 classified documents, the need to edit
Reagan's taped testimony and other matters would require delaying
Poindexter's trial from Feb. 20 to March 5.
   Richard Beckler, a lawyer for the former national security
adviser, urged that Reagan not be questioned until Iran-Contra
prosecutors completed presenting their case.
   ``I'm not going to buy that,'' Greene said. ``We are going to
proceed.''
   Greene accepted Reagan's proposal to have the deposition on
Friday in Los Angeles, but the judge rejected the suggestion by
Theodore Olson, one of Reagan's lawyers, that the questioning take
place in Reagan's offices.
   Greene said the U.S. courthouse has the necessary amount of
space plus security for classified documents.
   At a hearing, Greene said it was doubtful he would allow the
news media attend the deposition.
   Seven news organizations have filed an application seeking to
have the questioning open to the media and the public.
   The organizations _ Cable News Network, Capital Cities-ABC Inc.,
CBS Inc., National Broadcasting Co., The New York Times Co., Times
Mirror Co. of Los Angeles and The Washington Post _ argued that the
First Amendment right of access has been held to apply to pre-trial
proceedings in addition to all aspects of a criminal trial.
   One reason for having the questioning on videotape is so that if
Reagan inadvertently discloses classified information, that portion
can be edited before being shown at the trial.
   The news organizations said Greene could close portions of the
deposition if he believed the questioning would elicit sensitive
information at certain points. At a minimum, the media argued they
should have an opportunity to inspect and copy the videotape and
any written transcript ``as soon as possible after the proceeding.''
   Meanwhile, Greene must rule on whether the approximately 150
classified documents in dispute are necessary for Poindexter to get
a fair trial. If he rules that they are necessary and if U.S.
intelligence agencies refuse to allow their declassification, the
Poindexter case could be in jeopardy.
   As past Iran-Contra cases have shown, it is not unusual to have
unresolved last-minute disputes over the use of classified
material. There were repeated disputes over the use of such
material before and during the trial of former National Security
Council staff member Oliver North.
   Problems over the use of classified material led to dismissal of
criminal charges in the Iran-Contra case against former CIA station
chief Joseph Fernandez. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh filed an
affidavit barring disclosure of classified material dealing with
CIA facilities in Central America and certain CIA programs in Costa
Rica.
   Iran-Contra prosecutors are appealing that case to the U.S.
Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va.
   The prosecution argues that a lower court judge erred in ruling
that information pertaining to the programs and facilities was
material to Fernandez's defense. The prosecutors said the lower
court erred by not allowing substitutions for the classified
material proposed by the government.

<HEAD>Angolan Rebels Say Fighting Continues for Mavinga</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angolan rebels said Monday that fighting
raged for control of Mavinga airstrip, with government forces using
hundreds of Soviet-built tanks and dozens of aircraft to ``massacre
UNITA soldiers and civilians.''
   The statement from the National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola was released in Lisbon and signed by UNITA chief Jonas
Savimbi and other senior rebels.
   A separate UNITA miltary statement signed by Zacarias Mundombe,
vice-chief of army administration, said rebels pushed back Marxist
government forces to three miles outside Mavinga.
   The airstrip and a UNITA base near Mavinga's bombed-out old
town, 680 miles southeast of the capital city of Luanda, block the
way to the rebels' Jamba headquarters more than 120 miles farther
south.
   Fighting, said to be the heaviest in the 15-year-old civil war,
has raged there since late December. The government said it
captured Mavinga a week ago.
   UNITA people in Lisbon have said Savimbi was in Mavinga
organizing defense against the attacks after he cut short a
five-nation European tour in the Portuguese capital on Jan. 30.
   Neither statement on Monday revealed Savimbi's whereabouts.
   The military statement said government columns lost vehicles but
counter-attacked UNITA positions with MiG-23 jets. It gave no
casualty figures.
   It claimed 51 soldiers and four rebels died in a rebel attack
Saturday on a barracks at Quitexe, northern Uige province.
   The statement singed by Savimbi said UNITA was still open to
dialogue, based on a cease-fire and national reconciliation that
would open the way for a multiparty political system in Angola. It
called ``pure illusion'' any attempt ``to subjugate UNITA and force
us to accept negotiations with a knife at our throat.''
   The government offensive has been seen as a last-ditch attempt
to pressure UNITA into accepting government terms at possible peace
talks.
   Officials in Luanda introduced water rationing after UNITA
bombed the city's main water supply pipes, the Portuguese news
agency Lusa reported.
   UNITA has been fighting to force the government to share power
since Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975.

<HEAD>Alternate-Fuel Cars Idea Running Out of Gas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is easing away from a
proposal that would have required automakers to produce up to a
million alternate fuel cars as part of tougher air pollution
controls, officials acknowledged Monday.
   When President Bush proposed a broad-ranging program last summer
to clean up the nation's air, the centerpiece of plans to combat
urban smog was a call for legislation requiring automakers to
provide up to 1 million new cars annually by 1997 that could run on
fuels other than gasoline.
   The cars would be sold in nine cities where smog is worst and
were calculated eventually to reach 30 percent of the motor vehicle
fleets in those areas.
   But William Reilly, head of the Environmental Protection Agency,
confirmed Monday that the administration no longer considers
requiring the production of such cars, which would use fuels such
as methanol or natural gas, as essential to curbing urban smog.
   Instead, the administration is proposing in negotiations with
Senate leaders that a form of ``reformulated'' gasoline, which
would also reduce smog-causing pollution, might be an alternative
to automobiles using non-gasoline fuels.
   Vehicles using reformulated, low-polluting gasoline do not
require any additional equipment or modifications. Atlantic
Richfield Co. already is selling reformulated gasoline in
California.
   Reilly rejected sugestions that the change was a weakening of
the administration proposal to reduce automobile pollution.
   ``There is no change in the goals or the performance objectives
that we want to achieve, but we have tried to indicate more
flexibility about methods of getting there,'' he told reporters.
   Legislation before the Senate to tighten federal air pollution
controls does not include a requirement for alternative fuel
vehicles and, instead, would impose new automobile tailpipe
emission controls that the auto industry has vigorously opposed.
   But the White House has opposed the additional tailpipe emission
requirements, arguing that an alternative fuels vehicle program
focused on the areas with the dirtiest air is more economical and
achieves nearly as much pollution reduction.
   Some Senate Democrats have voiced frustration in recent days
over the changes in the administration's proposal, maintaining that
while the White House opposes tougher exhaust controls it is also
weakening the approach it is trying to sell as a substitute.
   Reilly acknowledged that the administration's original proposal
requiring automakers to produce and sell a specific number of
alternative fuel vehicles ``has caused us considerable opposition''
and kept some senators from joining in support.
   ``We have been willing for some months to redraft some language
on the alternative fuels (proposal) to try to reassure people that
... we do not prefer one fuel over another'' as long as the overall
pollution reduction is the same, said Reilly.
   Reilly suggested, for example, legislation that would require
all new cars in a polluted urban area to use the ``reformulated''
gasoline may accomplish the same pollution reductions as requiring
30 percent of cars in the area to run on something other than
gasoline.

<HEAD>Ritual Slayings Gang Member Dies in Mexico of AIDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Omar Francisco Orea Ochoa, a member of a cult
accused of committing ritual slayings along the U.S.-Mexico border,
has died of a heart attack brought on by AIDS, the Mexico City
attorney general's office said Monday.
   The government said he died of a heart attack Sunday afternoon
in the hospital at Mexico City's Santa Marta Acatitla federal
penitentiary. Dr. Francisco Guerra Izquierdo at the hospital said
the cardiac arrest was caused by AIDS.
   Orea Ochoa, 24, was diagnosed as having the deadly disease in
June, the attorney general's office said.
   Before joining the cult, he was a journalism student at Mexico's
National University.
   Orea Ochoa reportedly was the lover of Adolfo de Jesus
Constanzo, the Cuban-born leader of the cult. Orea Ochoa was one of
five cult members arrested May 6, when Constanzo ordered his own
killing and that of another man when police began closing in on
them in Mexico City.
   Authorities believe the gang was responsible for the deaths of
at least 13 people in and around Matamoros, across the Rio Grande
from Brownsville, Texas, and several others in Mexico City. The
April killing of Mark Kilroy, a Texas pre-medical student on a
border town visit, was the most widely publicized of those murders.
   Cult member Sara Aldrete said after her arrest that Constanzo
had invited her to join the Santeria cult and asked her to practice
voodoo rituals. They were designed in part to ``protect'' the
gang's drug smuggling from Mexico into Texas.
   Cult members originally were called ``narco-satanics'' under the
assumption their unusual rituals were connected to Satanism. After
further investigation, it was determined that Santeria is a blend
of Catholicism and old African beliefs that includes animal
sacrifices.
   Gang members were charged with homicide, criminal association,
wounding a police agent and damage to property.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a virus that attacks the
body's immune system, rendering it incapable of fighting illnesses.
It is most often transmitted by sexual contact or exchange of blood
products and there is no known cure.

sanctions against South Africa would undermine the ANC's push for
democracy. Mandela, founder of the ANC, was freed Sunday after 27
years in prison.
   ``The release of Mandela is the first step. It is not the end,''
said Gqiba at a news conference Monday. He is a guest at the
international meeting of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ).
   After his release, Mandela also reaffirmed his support for
continued economic sanctions until the government dismantles
apartheid, the legal separation of the races in South Africa.
   Gqiba fled South Africa in 1985 and has not returned. He has
since traveled the world speaking against apartheid.
   ``Our struggle has become an international war,'' he said.
   South Africa President F.W. de Klerk lifted a 30-year ban on the
ANC on Feb. 2. The ANC seeks a one-person, one-vote system, which
would be dominated by South Africa's 28 million blacks.
   Gqiba said he won't return to his homeland ``until the pillars
of racism'' are brought down.

<HEAD>Bulgarian Communists, Opposition Clash Over Parties in Workplace</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The opposition clashed with the ruling
Communists at negotiations Monday on the future of Bulgaria,
demanding the party withdraw from the workplace and that talks be
suspended until a consensus is reached.
   The state BTA news agency said the opposition, represented by
the loosely grouped Union of Democratic Forces, renewed its demand
that Communist Party organizations in factories and other work
places be dissolved.
   Last month the Communists announced plans to remove party
control of the armed forces and police.
   On Monday, the Communists agreed that party organizations should
also be banned from state offices, the judiciary, education and
health care, but not from the factory floor, BTA reported.
   The opposition wants a constitutional amendment placed before
Parliament to dissolve party organizations at factories before the
elections set for May.
   BTA said the opposition also wants action postponed on a measure
dealing with political parties, but the Communists also rejected
this proposal.
   On Tuesday, a working group will meet to try to reach a
compromise, it said.
   BTA reported that a spokesman for the opposition, not
identified, accused the Communists of stalling at the talks to
impede the opposition's election campaign.
   The Union of Democratic Forces has been negotiating for more
power-sharing with the Communists, who have so far rejected demands
for opposition access to radio and televison that would take their
platforms nationwide.
   According to BTA, however, reform Communists who split from the
party to form an Alternative Socialist Party last Sunday backed
opposition demands, as did the once-docile Agrarian Party.
   The opposition rejected an offer by the Agrarian Party to seek
an intermediary role and take part in the talks as a third
negotiating partner.
   Zhelyu Zhelev, chairman of the Union of Democratic Forces,
observed that the Agrarians had not gone into opposition. According
to BTA, Zhelev invited the Agrarians to join his group.
   Premier Andrei Lukanov was forced to form the country's first
all-Communist government last week after the Agrarian Party
announced it would no longer knuckle under to the Communists and
the opposition refused to heed Communist calls to join the
government.

<HEAD>Turkey Opens Sluice Gates, Euphrates Water Flows Downstream</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Turkey opened sluice gates of the huge
Ataturk Dam on Monday, allowing Euphrates River water to flow south
to Syria and Iraq.
   Turkey diverted the river's main flow Jan. 13 to increase the
water level in the Ataturk reservoir and finish some construction
work on diversion channels.
   Iraq and Syria protested that their agricultural land might be
damaged and their electricity production reduced.
   Cengiz Altinkaya, the public works minister, said at the dam
site 60 miles from the Syrian border near Sanliurfa that the
diversion channel opened Monday was closed in July 1988, and work
also was done on a second channel closed in May. His remarks were
carried by the semiofficial Anatolia News Agency.
   Ataturk Dam's reservoir has three main diversion channels. The
third was blocked last month and will not be opened for some time,
the agency report said.
   During the cutoff period, Syria and Iraq got water from
downstream tributaries of the Euphrates, but the flow was reduced
to about one-fifth the usual 500 cubic meters per second. Altinkaya
said average flow was being resumed Monday.
   The Euphrates originates in the mountains of eastern Turkey and
flows 1,460 miles through Syria and Iraq to confluence with the
Tigris River and Persian Gulf.
   Anatolia quoted officials at the dam as saying about 2.5 billion
cubic meters of water had accumulated in the Ataturk reservoir,
whose full capacity is nearly 20 times that.
   Tobacco farmers in Western Turkey rioted for higher support
prices Monday, breaking shop windows, blocking highways and
fighting police, news agencies reported.
   Anatolia said several thousand farmers blocked traffic for about
four hours by sitting on the railway line that connects Akhisar in
the Aegean region to Istanbul, and on the three major highways that
run through the town.
   Hurriyet, an independent agency, said the farmers later moved
into the center of Akhisar, 320 miles southwest of Ankara, and
broke the windows of the tobacco shops and the State Cigarette
Monopoly building.
   The farmers threw stones at police trying to disperse the crowd
and police arrested an undetermined number, Hurriyet reported.
   Support prices are what state-owned cigarette factories will pay
for the next tobacco crop. Because cigarette production is a
virtual government monopoly, they also determine the free-market
price.
   This year's support price was set 54 percent higher than for the
last crop, but farmers complain that it falls short of the 65
percent annual inflation rate.
   Resit Kursun, head of Turkish Chambers of Agriculture, told
state radio the price would not enable the farmers to repay their
production loans.

<TEXT>
   Mayor Erhard Krack, whose handshake with his
Western counterpart last November symbolized the historic crumbling
of the Berlin Wall, said Monday he plans to quit.
   The official East German news agency ADN said Krack decided to
resign following a furor over allegations of election fraud during
municipal balloting last May.
   East German opposition leaders used the fraud issue to rally
support for the peaceful revolution that ousted hard-line Communist
leaders and has brought the country to the threshold of its first
free elections.
   Krack will turn in his resignation at the next city council
meeting, but ADN did not say when it would be held.
   Krack and West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper shook hands on Nov. 12
minutes after a new opening had been cut in the Berlin Wall at
Potsdamer Platz, one of Europe's liveliest crossroads before World
War II. The historic meeting symbolized the crumbling of the Cold
War barrier that divided the city since 1961.
   Only three days before that, the East German government opened
its borders, allowing the Communist nation's people free access to
the West for the first time in 28 years.

   Several unions went on strike Monday,
including teachers and miners, and students marched into downtown
Niamey to protest the killing of three students by police last week.
   President Ali Saibou's military Cabinet, continuing an emergency
meeting begun over the weekend, praised ``the valor of the forces
of law and order'' who opened fire Friday to disperse a rally of
about 3,000 high school and university students.
   The government says police killed three people and wounded 33.
Students put the death toll at 12.
   A government statement said the Cabinet ordered all secondary
schools and Niamey University closed.
   Police did not interfere with Monday's march. The students also
denounced the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and
government for an unpopular austerity program that was a causes of
Friday's demonstration.
   Saibou's government said in its statement the Cabinet ordered an
investigation ``to unmask agitators and trouble-makers.'' It
claimed students were being manipulated by ``traitors to the
national cause pursuing personal ambitions.''
   Striking teachers said they also were protesting the arrests of
two colleagues detained on suspicion of encouraging student unrest.
   Leading politicians invited to the Cabinet meeting said the
government had agreed to meet with student representatives. No date
was given.
   In the past, the government has accused students of being greedy
in demands for larger grants, better-equipped libraries and
laboratories and guarantees of government jobs. The government has
put a freeze on public jobs.
   Government officials say the demands are excessive in one of the
world's poorest nations.
   The unrest is the worst in Niger since Saibou won a new
seven-year term Dec. 10.

   A leadership meeting of Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's Likud bloc broke down in chaos and shouts of anger
Monday after Shamir called for a vote of confidence in his plan for
Palestinian elections.
   Shamir stormed out of the session of the Likud Central Committee
after getting into a shouting match with his hard-line party rival,
Trade Minister Ariel Sharon, who said he would resign to protest
Shamir's policies.
   Shamir later claimed in a radio interview that he had received a
large show of support.
   The chaotic results left the already stalled Middle East peace
process in even worse shape and raised doubts about the future of
Shamir's fragile coalition Cabinet.
   Leaders of Likud's coalition partner, the center-left Labor
party, met Monday night and decided not to make any moves that
would likely break up the government as long as there is a chance
for peace. But a senior Labor official said the party would demand
a new Cabinet vote on the peace initiative and could leave the
government unless it got backing.
   Some Labor members demanded that the party quit the coalition
immediately because Israel's peace initiative has been compromised.
   ``I don't think we can continue to live in this marriage,''
Yossi Beilin, a top aide to Labor leader Shimon Peres, told The
Associated Press.
   In Washington, President Bush said Sharon's resignation could
suit U.S. policy if it led to progress in the stalled peace process.
   ``Mr. Shamir was a proponent of these talks, and if this clears
the way for the talks to go forward, that would (be) in keeping
with U.S. policy,'' Bush said at a White House news conference.
   Monday's meeting of Likud's Central Committee contained two
surprises.
   The first was Sharon announcing his resignation. The second was
the chaotic ending, which came after polls predicted a victory for
the prime minister over his hard-line rivals.
   The meeting broke down when Shamir called for a vote of
confidence at the end of a speech in which he essentially bent to
the political demands of Sharon and his supporters.
   ``Do you accept my proposal? Let us vote,'' Shamir shouted.
   But Sharon, who later claimed Shamir had broken an agreement to
delay the vote until the end of the debate, began shouting into a
microphone for a vote on his own stands.
   Hundreds of delegates raised their hands amid the chaos, and
both sides claimed they won.
   ``I received a decisive, massive majority,'' Shamir said moments
after leaving the meeting of Likud's 3,085-member Central Committee
in a circle of security guards.
   ``It was very clear that our proposals were accepted,'' Sharon
argued later in a radio interview.
   Sharon convened the meeting as a challenge to Shamir's
leadership and his peace plan, which envisages a limited
Palestinian autonomy in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The
Likud hawks say the plan gives the Palestinians too many
concessions.
   Opening the session, Sharon surprised even his close supporters
with his offer to resign from the Cabinet.
   ``My decision to resign from the government is in order to
continue the difficult struggle for our national goals ...
endangered as a result of policies of the present government,'' he
said.
   As he spoke, most delegates rose to their feet, and several
hundred began chanting ``Arik, Arik'' _ Sharon's nickname.
   Shamir tried to seize the initiative with an emotional speech
that embraced most of his rivals' stands: refusing to allow Arab
residents of annexed east Jerusalem to vote in the proposed
elections, and demanding an end to the 26-month Palestinian
uprising before peace could be negotiated.
   ``We cannot imagine real political negotiations and autonomy as
long as attacks and violence continue,'' Shamir said.
   Speaking later on army radio, Shamir indicated he would accept
the trade minister's resignation, saying: ``It seems natural that
Sharon resigns from a government whose policies he opposes in all
its aspects.''
   However, the prime minister and his chief supporters said the
chaotic meeting would not lead to a split in the party.
   ``This is not the end of Likud but the end of those who wanted
to break Likud down,'' said Environment Minister Ronnie Milo.
   But Moshe Zorenstein, a delegate, described the meeting as
``being at our own funeral.''

<TEXT>
   The armed forces on Monday
blamed leftist rebels for the death of at least six civilians in a
camp for recently returned refugees in northeastern El Salvador,
but witnesses said the five children and one adult died in an air
force attack.
   Twenty people also were reported wounded in the camp at Corral
de Piedra village, 53 miles northeast of San Salvador in
Chalatenango province.
   A statement from the armed forces press office said guerrillas
took refuge in the settlement Sunday and from catapults launched
bombs that landed among homes in the village. The statement gave no
details.
   On Monday, an army patrol at a roadblock barred seven foreign
journalists from entering the attack site.
   The camp was set up in Corral de Piedra last October for about
300 refugees who returned to El Salvador after spending eight years
in a refugee camp in neighboring Honduras.
   Army officers have recently accused the refugees of secretly
collaborating with the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front,
the guerrilla organization that has fought for power since 1979.
   Monsignor Eduardo Alas, Roman Catholic bishop of Chalatenango,
said the casualties were caused by air force helicopters and planes
rocketing the settlement.
   Alas told a local radio station one house where six people died
was hit by a rocket fired from a helicopter, and many roofs in
shanty homes were riddled by machine-gun fire.
   ``There were no guerrillas in the settlement,'' Noemy Lopez,
whose husband and infant daughter were killed, told The Associated
Press.
   She spoke in an interview at Rosales Hospital in San Salvador,
where she was recovering from shrapnel wounds.
   Emoteria Orellana, another victim at the hospital, also said the
village contained no guerrillas.
   Both women blamed the casualties on an air raid, which included
helicopters and an A-37 fighter-bomber jet, according to reports.
   An American nun, who works in the region and was in the village
on Sunday, also blamed the air force. She spoke on condition her
name not be used for fear of possible reprisals.
   The witnesses said guerrillas and soldiers engaged in a
firefight with automatic rifles outside the village around dawn,
but the rebels retreated long before the air raid began.

<TEXT>
   Slopes packed with skiers two weeks ago
were dotted with tanks on Monday as the forces of maverick
Christian Gen. Michel Aoun moved against the militia of a rival
Christian leader.
   Aoun's troops and Lebanese Forces militiamen under Samir Geagea
also fought with automatic weapons and hand grenades in the
rain-soaked streets of east Beirut, police reported.
   The general is under growing pressure to deliver a knockout blow
and seize Geagea's strongholds in east Beirut's Ashrafiyeh, Ein
Rummaneh and Karantina districts.
   But Aoun's troops were unable to break through the Lebanese
Forces defenses in the battle for control of the Christian enclave
north and northeast of Beirut that erupted Jan. 30.
   Police said the only casualty reports they had were one man
killed and a girl wounded by sniper fire late Monday in the
low-income district of Ein Rummaneh. Aoun's command, however,
reported the death of four officers and nine soldiers in the last
two days of combat.
   That raised the overall toll to 471 killed and 1,702 wounded in
two weeks of fighting.
   Aoun moved against Geagea's right-wing militia to eliminate the
main challenge to his authority as ruler of the 310-square-mile
enclave, home to 1 million Christians.
   But Geagea's 6,000-strong militia, which has 30,000 reservists,
is proving a tough opponent to Aoun's 19,000 troops in the
bloodiest intra-Christian fighting in the 15-year-old civil war.
   Police said Aoun's army was concentrating on a new front in the
mountain province of Kesrouan, a Maronite region 15 miles northeast
of Beirut.
   His tanks stabbed into a militia-held triangle formed by the
resort towns of Daraya, Kleiat and Ajaltoun below the ski slopes in
the Kesrouan mountains, police reported.
   A spokesman, who cannot be named under standing regulations,
said the hit-and-run mountain attacks appeared to be softening up
Lebanese Forces defenses before a large-scale assault to break a
militia siege of the army's main helicopter base at Adma and take
the whole of Kesrouan.
   The International Committee for the Red Cross, the Lebanese Red
Cross and Christian religious leaders issued fresh appeals Monday
for a mercy cease-fire to allow civil defense teams to recover at
least two dozen decomposing bodies from the sniper-infested streets.
   There was no formal break in the fighting, but civilians took
advantage of occasional lulls to dash across Beirut's dividing
Green Line into the Moslem sector, which has been outside the
combat zone.
   ``The snipers shot a woman running ahead of me,'' said Therese
Yakoub after she sprinted 500 yards across the Museum crossing, the
only gateway open along the 3-mile demarcation line.
   ``Poor thing, she has five children and she was planning to buy
bread and powdered milk for them,'' Ms. Yakoub said.
   Police said at least 75,000 Christians in the enclave have fled
to west Beirut and Syrian-controlled north and east Lebanon since
the fighting broke out.
   President Elias Hrawi appealed again to the superpowers, France
and the Vatican to support possible intervention by his
Syrian-backed troops to halt the fighting.
   Hrawi made a similar appeal last week. Beirut newspapers said
Pope John Paul II and France, traditional protector of Lebanon's
Christians, warned against Syrian military intervention.
   In Washington, the State Department said Monday night it was
clear that Aoun had pursued a ``violent course'' and ``bears
responsibility for the current round of senseless fighting among
Christians.''
   The department also expressed concern that Aoun's actions had
heightened the risk of greater Syrian involvement in Lebanon and
said only Hrawi could decide whether the Lebanese government should
intervene.
   ``We strongly support President Hrawi,'' it said in a statement.
   Aoun does not recognize Hrawi's Christian-Moslem government,
which is backed by Syria. He also has vowed to drive the Syrians,
who support the Moslem militias of west Beirut, from Lebanon.

   A domestic airliner hit a station wagon
and crashed while trying to land in southeastern Brazil Monday,
killing a woman and her son, an airline spokesman said. All 39
people aboard the plane survived.
   Luiz Carlos Franco, spokesman for TAM Regional Airlines, said
the 48-seat, twin-engine Fokker turboprop crashed at Bauru, 220
miles from Sao Paulo. The plane was flying from Sao Paulo to
Cuiaba, with a stop at Bauru.
   Franco said details still were lacking, ``but we can confirm
that all 36 passengers, the pilot, co-pilot and the flight steward
are alive. It was a real miracle.''
   Dr. Cesar Carvalho, director of Bauru Municipal Hospital, said
the pilot was in the intensive care unit and the co-pilot suffered
a fractured spine.
   The flight attendant and most of the 36 passengers were unhurt.
Some passengers were treated for minor scrapes and bruises and
released, Carvalho added.
   Carvalho said the plane hit and damaged two unoccupied houses in
trying to land, then hit a station wagon near the airport, killing
a 29-year-old woman and her 4-year-old-son.
   Maria Dalva, head of the news department of Bauru's Auri Verde
radio station, said, ``The plane crashed after it failed to gain
altitude following an unsuccessful landing attempt.''
   She said the wings and engines burst into flames but the
fuselage remained intact.
   ``Most of the passengers and crew members walked away from the
accident and only a few had to be carried on stretchers,'' Ms.
Dalva added.
   She and the others in Bauru spoke by telephone.

<HEAD>Judge Refuses to Drop $64 Million in Fines Against United Mine
Workers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LEBANON, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state judge refused Monday to drop $64
million in fines against the United Mine Workers, raising new doubt
about the future of a tentative settlement by 1,700 miners in three
states.
   The strike against Pittston Coal Group spread far beyond that
one company last summer, when thousands of miners staged wildcat
sympathy strikes.
   The UMW and Pittston reached a tentative agreement Jan. 1, but
union leaders said they wouldn't put the contract to a vote of the
rank and file until all legal action connected with the strike is
settled.
   Both the union and the company had asked Circuit Court Judge
Donald McGlothlin to drop the fines, but on Monday he refused. The
judge gave the union an additional 10 days to come up with new
arguments in favor of dropping the fines, imposed for a variety of
illegal strike activities.
   UWM General Counsel Robert Stropp said union leaders would
reassess their decision to withhold a vote on the tentative
contract. Asked if there may be a vote even if McGlothlin upholds
the fines, Stropp said, ``I think that is going to have to be part
of the assessment.''
   The union has said it would appeal a decision to impose the
fines.
   The union offered to have its 1,700 striking miners in Virginia,
West Virginia and Kentucky perform 10,000 hours of community
service over 30 days if the fines are waived. McGlothlin rejected
the offer Monday, calling it, ``an affront to this court.''
   The judge said dropping the fines would send the wrong message
to the community and to future strikers.
   McGlothlin said it would ``convince people ... that mass
violations of the law are a valid means of conducting a strike.''
   He said he knew dropping the fines would make all parties in the
dispute happy. Miners would be able to get back to work, state and
local governments would be free of the law enforcement burden
associated with the often violent strike and Pittston would be able
to return to full production.
   Pittston attorney Carl Kindig told the judge Monday a decision
to drop the fines would ``help bring an end to this dispute in a
fashion that will lead to labor peace in this area and ultimately
be in the public interest.''
   McGlothlin criticized Pittston for asking him to drop the fines
after coming to him repeatedly during the strike asking for harsh
penalties against the union.
   ``Now the same plaintiff says everything is fine and we want you
to drop everything and wipe the slate clean,'' he said. ``It's an
incredible irony in this court's opinion.''
   ``The courts are not pieces of a gameboard to be manipulated,''
McGlothlin said later.
   McGlothlin said there were 263 violent violations of his court
order restricting strike activities and 137 non-violent violations.
   The fines are the largest obstacle to a final settlement in the
strike, union officials said.
   Friday, the miners who have been on strike since April 5 moved a
step closer to a vote on returning to work as the National Labor
Relations Board settled complaints filed by both the company and
the union.
   U.S. District Judge Glen Williams will decide Tuesday or
Wednesday whether to waive nearly $1 million in strike-related
fines he assessed against the union.
   Both judges issued the fines for violations of court orders
limiting picket line activity and prohibiting the disruption of
Pittston's operations. About half of the fines were for violence
aimed at company personnel and property.
   McGlothlin also fined the union $5 million for taking over
Pittston's main coal processing plant in September for four days
and several million for the use of massive sit-down demonstrations
and enormous bumper-to-bumper convoys of cars and trucks to block
coal truck traffic.

   Scientists gathered to review a
10-year study on the causes and effects of acid rain were warned
Monday that their work won't provide a quick fix for policy-makers.
   ``The full story is seldom, if ever, known about the complex
issues of environmental science,'' said William Rosenberg, an
assistant administrator for the federal Environmental Protection
Agency.
   ``Scientific investigation must continue, including an
evaluation of the control program put in place,'' Rosenberg said.
``In the meantime, we must take prudent actions to protect our
health and our environment.''
   About 700 scientists from across the United States and 35
foreign countries have gathered to review 28 draft reports on acid
rain compiled by the National Acidic Rain Assessment Program. The
program was established 10 years ago by Congress and has spent $500
million investigating acid rain, which is caused by air pollution
and is said to pose the greatest threat to lakes in the Northeast
and upper Midwest.
   Acid rain is a blanket term for a combination of sulfur dioxide
and nitrogen oxide which mixes in the atmosphere and can fall as
rain, snow, fog or dust particles. It can make lakes and streams
acidic and can kill trees.
   Along with smog, acid rain is a target of clean air legislation
being considered in Congress that would would reduce pollution from
factories, power plants and automobiles.
   About 1,000 researchers have been at work during the past decade
compiling the reports being considered at the conference. The
documents don't take policy stands.
   ``You have changed the way the world thinks about acid rain and
you've helped policy-makers decide which steps need to be taken,''
said Michael Deland, chairman of the Council on Environmental
Quality.
   But, he added, ``it is highly unlikely we'll reach scientific
certainty on issues like acid rain.''
   That thought was echoed by James Mahoney, director of the
assessment program.
   `We must critically analyze all our hypotheses. But there is no
way the scientific community can provide a single answer that this
is the level'' for reducing industrial emmissions.
   Most of the reports which are the focus of the meeting have been
released over the past two months. This week's meeting gives
scientists from aboard a chance to review the material.
   Discussions Monday centered on acidity in the nation's streams
and lakes based on sampling completed in the mid-1980s.
   The survey found that 4.2 percent of the 1,181 lakes sampled
were considered acidic with the most acidic lakes in the Northeast,
the upper Midwest and Florida.
   The study also found that 2.7 percent of the 5,506 kilometers of
streams sampled are acidic _ most of those streams in the
Appalachian Mountains and the mid-Atlantic coastal plain.

   Nelson Mandela said Monday he
seeks a South Africa that is fair to both whites and blacks, and he
insisted that violence against apartheid is justified.
   The 71-year-old black leader, enjoying his first full day of
freedom after 27 years in prison, defended the policies of his
African National Congress but said talks with the government could
be held soon.
   In the tribal homeland of Ciskei, 10 blacks celebrating
Mandela's release Sunday night were shot and killed by police, and
20 were injured, according to the Daily Dispatch newspaper in
nearby East London. Homeland authorities refused to comment, and
civil rights groups demanded a judicial inquiry.
   In Mandela's hometown of Soweto, schools were deserted as
thousands of students marched and danced in the streets,
anticipating his return home. Believing Mandela was due back for an
afternoon rally, tens of thousands of Sowetans crammed into a
soccer stadium, and dozens were injured in the crush.
   Hundreds of youths heading home from the stadium surrounded a
police van and freed 13 prisoners inside, according to Gen. Herman
Stadler, a police spokesman. He said the officers in the vehicle
decided not to use their firearms, and no injuries were reported.
   The activists making arrangements for Mandela decided he should
not re-enter Soweto until Tuesday, when a massive welcoming rally
was planned. They refused to disclose where he would spend the
night, although television networks deployed helicopters to pursue
him.
   ``I am absolutely excited to be out,'' Mandela told reporters in
Cape Town before taking an evening flight to Johannesburg. He was
released unconditionally on Sunday.
   Mandela said negotiations between the ANC and the government
could begin ``very soon'' if President F.W. de Klerk continues his
peace initiative and makes further reforms.
   ``The state of emergency has to be lifted in its entirety and
political prisoners have to be released,'' Mandela told more than
200 journalists assembled on the lawn outside the official
residence of Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu in Cape Town.
   At a news conference in Washington on Monday, President Bush
expressed optimism Monday that Mandela's release was a sign the
Pretoria government was ``at last'' on the way to ending apartheid,
but Bush showed no inclination to move quickly to lift U.S.
economic sanctions.
   He noted that he had invited both Mandela and de Klerk to the
White House _separately, with no times yet fixed _ and wanted to
discuss sanction provisions with them.
   Andries Treurnicht, leader of the pro-apartheid Conservative
Party, accused the de Klerk government of falling victim to
``Mandela hysteria'' and moving toward white surrender. Eugene
TerreBlanche, leader of the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement,
said de Klerk is now powerless to control Mandela, and he warned
that his movement ``will protect itself and its property when the
government can no longer do so.''
   Mandela said whites should not fear the prospect of an ANC-led
government.
   ``Whites are fellow South Africans. We want them to feel safe,''
he said at his news conference. ``The ANC ... will find a solution
that will suit both blacks and whites.''
   The ANC seeks a one-person, one-vote system, which would be
dominated by South Africa's 28 million blacks. De Klerk seeks to
negotiate a new constitution that would establish some political
rights for blacks, but provide the 5 million whites with some sort
of veto over major decisions.
   Police have reported about 40 deaths in unrest around the
country since daybreak Sunday, including a clash between police and
looters in Cape Town that left one black dead and more than 100
people injured.
   Tutu, in an unusual move, issued a statement deploring the
looting and refraining from criticism of the police. Other
activists appealed to blacks to welcome Mandela in a dignified,
non-violent manner.
   At midday Monday, a white security guard in Johannesburg killed
a man who was among a group of blacks that chased and cornered him,
carrying bricks and clubs, police said. The group had been chanting
slogans welcoming Mandela's release, the police said.
   In Cape Town, a bomb blast damaged a ticket office at a stadium
where an English cricket team is due to play this week in defiance
of an international sports boycott.
   Mandela said the white government's intention when it jailed him
and other ANC leaders ``was that we should be forgotten.''
   Instead, his release from prison was covered by journalists from
around the world as an epic event that could lead to sweeping
political change in South Africa.
   Mandela said he had been conferring with government officials
for the past three years on the prospect of negotiations with the
ANC, as well as on the issue of freeing political prisoners.
   He denied there was conflict between his commitment to peaceful
solutions and his endorsement of the ANC's guerrilla campaign.
   ``I have committed myself to the promotion of peace in the
country. But I have done so as part and parcel of the decisions and
campaign that have been taken by the ANC ... The armed struggle is
a defensive act against apartheid.''
   The ANC's bombing and sabotage campaign, launched by Mandela and
his colleagues in 1961, has been nearly dormant in the past year,
although the movement has refused to confirm it is scaling back its
military actions.
   Mandela reaffirmed his support for continued economic sanctions
until the government dismantles the institutionalized racism of
apartheid. He also endorsed the ANC's commitment to nationalization
of South Africa's mines.
   He told reporters his years in prison were hard.
   ``I have lost a great deal over these 27 years and my wife has
been under all sorts of pressure,'' he said. ``It's not a nice
feeling for a man to see his family struggling without dignity,
without a man around.''
   Mandela described de Klerk, who on Feb. 2 lifted a 30-year ban
on the ANC, as ``flexible'' and ``a man of integrity.''
   ``If Mr. de Klerk is able to carry the National Party with him
in the new line he has taken ... then I think very soon we will be
able to begin negotiations,'' he said.
   He said he wanted to travel soon to Lusaka, Zambia, to consult
with the ANC's exiled leadership. He said he had no right to decide
unilaterally what role he would play.
   The decision to free Mandela, after a long international
campaign on his behalf, was announced de Klerk on Saturday. Eight
days earlier, de Klerk lifted bans on the ANC and other opposition
groups, suspended executions, and announced other reforms aimed at
clearing the way for black-white negotiations.
   In the mid-1980s, Mandela rejected offers to go free in exchange
for a renunciation of violence.

   Britain called on Monday for a swift relaxation of
sanctions against South Africa to save President F.W. de Klerk from
being toppled by a white backlash.
   But most other countries said the release Sunday of black leader
Nelson Mandela was not enough to warrant easing sanctions. The
12-nation European Community appeared likely to isolate Britain on
the issue, and President Bush said it was too early to talk about
lifting sanctions.
   The Soviet Union, which armed Mandela's African National
Congress guerrilla movement, and China joined in international
expressions of delight at Mandela's freedom.
   The Iranian Foreign Ministry said Mandela's release was ``a
token of good omen'' because it came on the 11th anniversary of
Iran's Islamic revolution.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia,
Cyrpus, said the Foreign Ministry also reffirmed its support for
the struggle against apartheid and warned South Africa's blacks to
watch out for ``the tricks of racist agents and weathered
supporters of the world arrogance.''
   World arrogance is Iran's term for the United States.
   Most African nations, including powerful Nigeria, said the
continent's last white government had taken a significant step but
should still be isolated. However, two West African conservatives,
the Ivory Coast and Gabon, urged immediate closer ties with South
Africa.
   In London, Foreign Office Minister William Waldegrave said it
was ``vital to send a signal to the white community that President
de Klerk's steps will find a response from the international
community.''
   ``If we don't provide any response at all ... (you) will surely
blame us when the white backlash sweeps de Klerk away,'' Waldegrave
retorted in acrimonious exchanges wth opposition Labor Party
legislators in the House of Commons.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher wrote to fellow European
Community leaders Sunday seeking an end to a 1986 ban on new
investment in South Africa and to a ban on promoting tourism there.
European Community foreign ministers will consider the proposal at
a Feb. 20 meeting.
   Mandela, who walked free Sunday after more than 27 years in
jail, said that sanctions and the armed struggle should continue.
   In a radio interview, Waldegrave brushed aside the international
chorus for continued sanctions. He said the only countries whose
positions mattered were the United States, Japan, West Germany and
Britain _ all major South African trading partners.
   ``It doesn't actually matter very much what the distant chorus
says,'' said Waldegrave. ``What really matters is that those who
have influence show to de Klerk that his line ... is going to get a
response. If it doesn't get a response he will be swept away.''
   Ireland, current president of the European Community, said it
believed the trade bloc should maintain its embargoes. The
relatively mild sanctions include bans on imports of coal, iron and
gold coins.
   ``President de Klerk displays great moral courage ... but (it
is) only a start,'' said Irish Deputy Prime Minister Brian Lenihan
said in Dublin.
   Other big trading partners confined themselves to welcoming
Mandela's release.
   In Bonn, West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher
called it a ``decisive step'' and said his government would insist
on a ``national dialogue in South Africa.''
   Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan said it was a
``clear turning point'' that would allow South Africa to move
toward democracy.
   In Beijing, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said China welcomed the
release of a man ``respected by all the justice-upholding people
the world over, including the Chinese people,'' the Xinhua news
agency reported.
   In Moscow, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov
told reporters, ``We hail the release of Nelson Mandela ... a step
that should have been taken long ago.''
   At its exile headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia, the ANC renewed its
commitment to armed struggle. ``Our glorious people's army must be
given all the necessary and possible assistance to enable it to
enhance its combat capacity,'' ANC Secretary-General Alfred Nzo
declared.
   Nzo made no reference to a call Sunday by Zambian President
Kenneth Kaunda for the ANC to suspend bombings and other guerrilla
actions in South Africa, but to maintain its military capability in
case of violence by right-wing extremists.
   Zambian officials said Mandela telephoned Kaunda Sunday night
and in emotional exchanges thanked him for ``his steadfast support
for the ANC.''
   In Damascus, Syrian President Hafez Assad welcomed Mandela's
release and compared the fight against apartheid to Arab efforts to
regain land claimed by Israel.

   The Soviet Union challenged the United States on
Monday to extend superpower cooperation in arms control
surveillance to the high seas and to space.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, addressing the opening
of a 23-nation ``Open Skies'' conference, also accused the United
States of bolstering its naval strength even while agreeing to cut
ground forces and land-based missiles.
   ``Let us face the truth,'' Shevardnadze said. ``Today, the
easiest way to launch a surprise attack, a military invasion or an
aggression is from the seas.''
   U.S. officials dismissed the idea, telling reporters in a
separate briefing that Washington was not interested in a naval
arms control agreement and that surveillance flights already are
allowed over oceans and in space.
   However, President Bush told a White House news conference that
he expected a ``major success'' on arms control at June's
superpower summit in the United States.
   Shevardnadze's tough speech, and one by Secretary of State James
A. Baker III leveling criticism at Soviet positions, broke from a
recent trend of soft-spoken reconciliation between the superpowers.
   The exchange also strayed from he main topic at hand, an
agreement between the 16 members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and the seven members of the Warsaw Pact on allowing
the alliances to survey member nations by air.
   Bush originally made the proposal in May. It includes aerial
inspection on 24 hours' notice to allay fears of surprise attack.
   The plan has been promoted as a confidence-building measure and
both alliances have agreed to it in principle.
   Shevardnadze endorsed the proposal, which is likely to get final
approval at a second conference in Budapest, Hungary, this year.
   He also announced that an agreement was reached during Baker's
talks last week in Moscow to provide for inspections of radar sites.
   A Soviet team will be permitted to go to Thule, Greenland, and
to U.S. installations in Britain, while an American group inspects
the Siberian radar station at Krasnoyarsk and other sites.
   The two sides have exchanged accusations that the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty's limitations on a defense against
missiles are being violated.
   Shevardnadze acknowledged last year that some activities at
Krasnoyarsk were illegal and promised to dismantle the station.
   On Monday he criticized the United States at length for
excluding naval forces from disarmament talks and for the ``Star
Wars'' program of seeking ways to use nuclear weapons in space to
block a ballistic missile attack.
   ``Again and again, at various negotiations, the issue of naval
arms and confidence-building measures affecting the activity of
states on the seas and oceans is being left out of consideration,''
the Soviet foreign minister said.
   ``No fair argument is cited to justify this,'' he said.
   Sarcastically, Shevardnadze said of the U.S. space program:
``They do not just grow chickens.''
   He urged the Bush administration and all nations to join in
developing a system to verify activities in space.
   On the open seas, Shevardnadze said, there should be exchanges
of information about fleet positions and movements of large naval
formations.
   ``Strong rays of light should focus on the darkest corners of
military activity,'' he said.
   Baker, meanwhile, said positions taken by Moscow on troops and
aircraft still stand in the way of completing a treaty this year to
limit non-nuclear forces.
   He criticized Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for
rejecting a proposal by Bush that would permit the United States to
keep 30,000 troops in Britain, Italy and Spain, while both sides
were held to 195,000 in Central Europe.
   Gorbachev countered with ceilings of 225,000 Soviet troops to
195,000 U.S. soldiers on foreign soil throughout Europe. That
would, in effect, prevent a U.S. numerical edge because the Soviets
could offset in Central Europe any Americans stationed eslewhere on
the continent.
   Bush Monday said he stood by his plan.
   Baker said Gorbachev's proposal for equal ceilings had not taken
into account that the Soviets could quickly expand their forces in
a crisis while American troops would be an ocean away.
   Baker also criticized the Soviets' resistance to imposing
ceilings on aircraft that Moscow claims have a defensive role. This
was ``hardly a step toward arms reduction,'' Baker said.
   Raising the prospect of an impasse, Baker said ``disagreements
over aircraft limits must not prevent us from signing a CFE
(Conventional Forces in Europe) agreement this year.''
   A senior U.S. official suggested, however, that the issue might
be finessed by leaving airplanes out of the treaty.
   Baker's tough approach seemed in contrast with his description
in Moscow last Friday of Gorbachev's proposal on troop levels as
``very, very interesting,'' and close to Bush's approach. He said
he would consult the NATO allies before giving a U.S. reply.
   A response _ and an early agreement _ now appears to be unlikely
before Baker flies home Tuesday night.
   Baker and Shevardnadze met outside the conference to discuss
German reunification. They set another meeting for Tuesday.
   Baker suggested this scenario, according to State Department
officials:
   After East Germany holds elections March 18, officials of the
new government would meet with West German leaders to begin
planning unification.
   They would make decisions on the new Germany's legal and
political arrangements and the size of its army.
   Afterward, the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and
France would discuss ``security arrangements'' to allay the
concerns of Germany's neighbors.
   As sovereign states, however, the two Germanys would have
control of the nation's destiny.
   The Soviets have stressed those concerns, and Shevardnadze
proposed two weeks ago an international plebisicite.
   But the State Department officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the Soviets were ``quite interested'' in the U.S.
proposal and that it had the endorsement of Britain and France.

   Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov said
Monday the Soviet Union is on the right track at the start of a
radical, far-reaching process of change, despite world talk about a
crisis in his country.
   He spoke at a news conference in Bangkok at the end of a two-day
visit to Thailand, days after the Soviet Communist Party announced
it was willing to give up its constitutional right to the leading
role in government.
   Ryzhkov then flew to Melbourne, Australia, for a three-day visit
and was greeted by Prime Minister Bob Hawke.
   He said in Bangkok that Moscow had laid the basis of
revitalization and that economic changes had brought some positive
results, although he admitted ``in some respects we have found that
things are not moving in the direction that we planned.''
   He said rival political parties would be allowed to form ``some
time in the future,'' although the government believed the party
should remain the driving force in the country.
   But the Communists would take part in politics as an equal and
their leading role would be gained through political struggle, not
by right, he said.
   ``Of course it is a new thing for us and we are just starting on
our way (but) first experience has shown us that we are on the
right track,'' he said.
   He said new political parties would need a legal basis as the
process of change under way also had some negative implications.
   ``If the parties ... are for drawing two nationalities against
each other, then these organizations should not be established and
we shall fight against such organizations,'' he said.
   Ryzhkov's 50-member delegation included Deputy Foreign Minister
Igor Rogachev. He was the first Soviet prime minister to visit
Thailand.
   Ryzhkov said earlier that peace in Cambodia would benefit the
entire region. A Soviet-backed government there has been fighting
Western- and Chinese-backed guerrillas in an 11-year-old conflict.
   He said the Khmer Rouge guerrilla faction should take part in a
meeting of warring Cambodian factions scheduled in Jakarta from
Feb. 26-28. The group has indicated it will not attend.
   Ryzhkov held talks Monday with Prime Minister Chatichai
Choonhavan and had an audience with King Bhumipol Adulyadej.
   In a luncheon speech, Chatichai, whose government backs the
guerrillas, praised Moscow's ``constructive efforts in helping to
find a political solution to the Cambodia problem.''
   Ryzhkov said the Soviets were eager to improve trade ties and
felt they could offer Thailand's developing economy expertise and
modern technology to strengthen its basic industries.
   While in Australia, he is to visit three cities and sign several
agreements ranging from port access for Soviet fishing trawlers to
commodities deals. Ryzhkov then is to travel on to Singapore.
   Thailand, Australia and Singapore are major players in the
Cambodian issue.
   On Monday, the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council _ the Soviet Union, the United Styates, China, Britain and
France _ arranged to meet U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar to brief him on efforts to enhance the U.N. role in the
peace process, including plans for the world body to administer
Cambodia and supervise elections.

   President Bush urged Congolese President Denis
Sassou-Nguesso to keep promoting peace in Angola and saluted ``the
growing health of free markets and free ideas'' in the Congo.
   At a state dinner Monday night honoring the president of the
People's Republic of the Congo, Bush said Sassou had helped make
Southern Africa ``a more peaceful and stable place.
   ``Namibia will soon be independent. The new beginnings in South
Africa may help end an old evil, apartheid,'' said Bush. ``And in
Angola, as Cuban troops are leaving, our search for national
reconciliation has intensified.''
   He urged Sassou to use his ``respected voice'' to pursue peace
and self-determination for the people in Angola.
   Bush said the Congo, once closely aligned with Moscow, ``has
taken some welcome steps, encouraging private enterprise, placing
some limits on the power of single-party rule and opening the
legislature to non-party groups.''
   Bush raised a glass to toast Sassou's health, success and ``the
growing health of free markets and free ideas in your homeland.''
   Sassou applauded Bush's role in leading the world to a more
peaceful era, saying, ``History will note that the U.S.-USSR
dialogue of the 90s helped sketch out the 21st century.''
   Speaking in French, the Congolese president said: ``May all
benefit from these trends, big people as well as small. May
democracy and freedom be combined with peace and development.''
   He called life in Africa today ``tragic'' and said international
support, especially from the seven major Western democracies, is
needed more than ever before ``to ensure our survival and our
recovery.''
   Earlier, in welcoming Sassou to the White House, Bush assured
his visitor that the dramatic events in Europe will not diminish
U.S. interest in African affairs.
   ``Africa's our friend. And friends don't forget one another,''
Bush said at a full-dress military welcome.
   Bush said that despite ``undiminished'' U.S. support for the
UNITA rebels, ``we continue to hope for a negotiated settlement to
that tragic war'' in Angola.
   Bush recalled he had visited Africa three times as vice
president and said he hoped to do so again as president.
   ``Some have suggested that events in the rest of the world,
including Central Europe, mean that the United States will no
longer pay attention to AFrica. I can assure you and everyone in
Africa that this is not the case,'' said Bush.
   ``I hereby renew the commitment of the American people and
government to ... (work closely) in partnership with Africa,'' Bush
said.
   Sassou paid tribute to the 200-year history of freedom in the
United States that ``has inspired so many ideals and dreams for
mankind.'' He called Bush ``one of the great figures who have
inherited this rich legacy.''
   Noting that this is African-American History Month and Monday
was the birthday of Abraham Lincoln, Sassou also invoked the
memories of Lincoln and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
   ``Their lives, their struggle, represent for us Africans a
never-ending source of admiration, pride and hope,'' he said.
   Both leaders hailed the release from a South African prison of
Nelson Mandela.
   Bush called it ``another important sign that South Africa may
soon begin negotiating a democratic, nonracial society and at last
be on the way to ending apartheid once and for all.''
   Sassou said Mandela was ``a great symbol of dignity for African
men'' whose ``release ushers in great prospects for the
negotiations on the future of South African society. From this day
on, the Congo can look forward with optimism to the future of its
own relations with South Africa.''
   This was the first official visit of a Congolese president,
although Sassou came here in 1986 as chairman of the Organization
of African Unity. The United States is its largest trading partner,
importing $400 million worth of Congolese petroleum annually.

   Israeli-backed militiamen shot and killed three
suspected guerrillas Monday in south Lebanon, Israeli military
sources said.
   One soldier from the South Lebanon Army militia was slightly
wounded in the incident, said the sources, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   They said a force from the Israeli-backed militia opened fire
after spotting the guerrilla squad near Taibe, a village 2{ miles
from the Israeli border. Three were killed, they said.
   The sources were unable to identify the guerrillas, but Israel's
Itim national news agency said documents on the bodies indicated
they were members of the Lebanese Communist Party.
   The clash occurred in Israel's self-proclaimed security zone, a
six- to 10-mile-wide strip of land patrolled by Israeli troops and
the SLA militia.
   Israel carved out zone in 1985 when it removed the most of its
troops from Lebanon following the 1982 invasion of that country.

   The Rev. Daniel Berrigan and 15 others who
blocked the elevator doors in the federal building in this city to
protest U.S. aid to El Salvador were convicted by a federal judge
Monday of obstruction.
   U.S. Magistrate Ronald Fonseca sentenced Berrigan and each of 14
other defendants to 20 hours of community service. Another
defendant was ordered to spend seven days in a halfway house
because she was on probation for trespassing in an anti-nuclear
protest.
   ``This court does not doubt you're sincere,'' Fonseca told the
defendants. ``But you cannot force your actions (on others) merely
to prove your case.''
   Berrigan and 22 others were arrested Dec. 1 in the Hale Boggs
Federal Building after they blocked the eight elevators in the
lobby for more than an hour.
   As many as 100 demonstrators went to the federal building that
day to protest U.S. aid to El Salvador, where six Jesuit priests
were slain in November. Berrigan is a Jesuit priest.
   Of the 23 arrested, seven pleaded guilty earlier and also were
sentenced to perform community service.
   Bill Quigley, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union,
said he didn't plan to appeal Fonseca's decision.
   ``The trial today showed there is justice and there is law,''
Quigley said. ``I think it was a technically correct decision. I
think the defendants were correct as well.''
   Berrigan, a veteran of anti-war and other protests who says he's
lost count of the number of times he's been arrested, was less
conciliatory.
   ``I feel the whole thing was a cover-up for the illegal murders
of the Jesuit priests,'' Berrigan said.
   Quigley argued the protesters should be acquitted because
federal law requires that rules governing prohibited behavior in
federal buildings must be posted in a conspicuous place. They
weren't when the demonstration occurred, he said.
   Several of the defendants testified they weren't told blocking
the elevators was a federal crime.
   Prosecutor Patrice Harris argued that they should have known.
   The one protester sentenced to seven days in a halfway house was
Janet LeBoeuf. She has lost nearly 20 pounds since she began a
water-only fast Jan. 22 at St. Louis Cathedral to protest continued
Salvadoran aid after the six priests were killed.
   She said she would continue the fast in jail if she is sentenced
in connection with the demonstration.
   ``The question for me is not when will the fast end, but when
will the military aid to El Salvador end,'' she said.
   Berrigan lives in New York City, where he works with AIDS
patients. He was arrested last week in New York for blocking the
doors of the office of U.S. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.

   Sen. Strom Thurmond, who at 87 is the oldest
member of Congress, announced Monday he would seek a seventh term.
   ``I am just your humble servant,'' the Republican told a small
group of supporters gathered in his western South Carolina hometown.
   ``I'm proud of South Carolina and we will continue to work
together to make it the greatest state in the nation,'' Thurmond
said. ``In all my years of public service I have never felt a
stronger obligation to continue my work for the future of our state
and our nation.''
   Thurmond became the oldest member of Congress when Rep. Claude
Pepper, D-Fla., died last year at age 88.
   The South Carolina legislator, who has served in the Senate
since 1955, was president pro tem from 1981 through 1987.
   A former governor, state senator and judge who ran
unsuccessfully for president as a Dixiecrat in 1948, he switched
from the Democratic Party to the GOP in 1964.
   Thurmond has a campaign war chest of about $700,000, according
to the Federal Elections Commission, and no formal opposition.
   ``I've had opponents every time,'' he said. ``The office belongs
to the people. I'm a temporary occupant of the office.''
   Wearing a red, white and blue tie and an American flag pin in
his lapel, Thurmond said that if re-elected, he would work to
improve education and the quality of life and to protect the
environment.
   Thurmond celebrated his 87th birthday in December and said at
the time his secret for a long life is a good diet, exercise and an
optimistic outlook.

   Sudanese rebels said Monday they had shot
down a transport plane ferrying troops to the southern Sudan town
of Maridi.
   In a clandestine radio broadcast, the Sudan People's Liberation
Army said the C-130 Hercules was brought down last Thursday by ``a
heat-seeking missile.''
   ``The plane fell inside Maridi and all aboard perished,'' said
the broadcast monitored in Kenya's capital of Nairobi. It gave no
estimate on the casualty toll.
   The broadcast said the plane was one of two being used by the
government to return an estimated 1,000 soldiers who fled into
northwest Zaire following the fall of a border garrison last month.
   The rebels also claimed to have halted a relief convoy bound
from Malakal to Juba, the besieged capital of eastern Equatoria
province, killing 72 government soldiers and destroying 10 trucks
and two tanks.
   There was no independent confirmation of the claims.

<HEAD>Gray Whales Behind Schedule, Mexican Authorities Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TALLI NAUMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexican officials said a weekend aerial
survey showed low numbers of gray whales arriving in bays along the
Pacific coast of Baja California though U.S.-based whalewatchers
reported were seeing normal numbers.
   ``Only about 20 percent of the normal population has arrived,
and we're still concerned,'' said Ulises Cesena Montano,
coordinator of the Vizcaino Biosphere Reserve, a favored gray whale
calving area.
   But he said bad weather limited the survey.
   The San Diego Sportfishing Council, whose members run commercial
whale-watching expeditions to the Baja California lagoons, said its
members were reporting normal numbers of whales.
   Flyovers of the San Ignacio and Ojo de Liebre lagoons on
Saturday and Sunday revealed 90 grays, Cesena said by telephone
Monday.
   Jorge Hernandez, a biologist at Vizcaina, said he spotted 30
more of the marine mammals off the coast south of the reserve
between Todos Santos and San Jose del Cabo.
   ``That probably means that along the length of the coast there
are many more,'' Hernandez said.
   But he said the number of gray whales normally in the lagoons at
this time of year ranges from 900 to 1,150.
   ``The reality right now is that the population has been held up,
and we still don't know why,'' Cesena said.
   Patricia Warhol, director of the American Cetacean Society in
Los Angeles, which also runs whalewatchers' expeditions, said her
organization received reports that the whales arrived in Baja
California in the same numbers as usual.
   She said her association calculates that the same number of
whales as usual passed the southern California coast on their
migration, but they showed up late and followed a new migration
route.
   ``The migration was two weeks late here, and they're now going
outside the Channel Islands instead of through the (Santa Barbara)
channel. Possibly that makes the trip a little longer and they may
not have shown up yet,'' Ms. Warhol said, adding that weather and
food supplies can influence migration timing.
   Cesena said Baja California experts speculate that a previously
unknown cold current, called the Corriente de la Nina, might be
holding up the whales.
   The species was once hunted almost to extinction, but estimates
of the total population now run from 17,000 to 21,000.

   The Coast Guard vessel monitor who was
on duty when the Exxon Valdez ran aground testified Monday that he
never looked for the tanker on his radar screen before the nation's
biggest oil spill.
   Bruce Blandford, testifying in the trial of former tanker
captain Joseph Hazelwood on felony criminal mischief and other
charges, said he came on duty 40 minutes before the disaster. He
said he was told by Gordon Taylor, the monitor who preceeded him,
that the ship had gone out of radar range.
   Blandford said he heard nothing from Hazelwood and added, ``I
wasn't looking for him because he had been lost (from radar) and I
had no reason to believe anything was happening other than what Mr.
Taylor had told me.''
   He said he went about straightening up papers, had coffee and
did his chores without looking at the radar before he got a radio
message.
   He said Hazelwood called to report the Exxon Valdez was ``hard
aground and leaking oil.''
   ``Did you respond immediately?'' asked Assistant District
Attorney Brent Cole.
   ``It seemed like forever,'' said the witness. ``It took about a
minute for me to figure out what was going on.''
   Blandford said he glanced at his radar screen and could see the
marker indicating the troubled ship. I asked him, ``Are you about a
mile north of Bligh Reef? And he said yes.''
   In other testimony, two seamen who took turns at the helm on the
Exxon Valdez painted a chaotic picture of the minutes before the
tanker went aground.
   Harry Claar told of being at the helm about 11:20 p.m. when
Hazelwood ordered him to put the ship on automatic pilot. He said
he followed the order and yielded the helm to Robert Kagan just
before midnight.
   Kagan said he knew the tanker was on automatic pilot when he
took over and can't remember when the order came to go back to hand
steering. He said he and the third mate, Gregory Cousins, were near
the autopilot control and, ``We both reached for it at the same
time.''
   Then, he said, he heard three separate commands to go right,
left and then right again. In the final seconds before grounding,
he said, there was a command to turn hard left and Cousins grabbed
the wheel with him.
   ``I started making the turn and he grabbed the wheel and helped
make it,'' Kagan said. ``I think he was kind of panicking then. ...
He was kind of excited.''
   At last, Kagan said, he heard ``a little rattle, bumping'' and
the ship was aground.
   Asked about Hazelwood's orders after the grounding, Kagan said
he can't be sure whether the captain was trying to move the ship
off the rocks or stabilize it on the rocks.
   ``I really wasn't sure what he was doing,'' the witness said.
   Cousins took the stand briefly before court recessed, and was to
tell his version of the grounding Tuesday.
   During questioning of Blanford, Cole asked the civilian Coast
Guard employee what went through his mind at the time of the
grounding, but Blandford said he didn't remember.
   ``I did a pretty hard swallow ... the adrenalin started
pumping.'' He said he called the commanding officer of the Coast
Guard station and told him ``this was the big one _ the Exxon
Valdez was on the rocks leaking oil.''
   Within an hour, he said, phones were ringing off the walls and
the Coast Guard had begun search and rescue operations.
   The Exxon Valdez was gashed open when it hit part of the long,
jagged Bligh Reef, and spewed more than 10 million gallons of oil
into Prince William Sound. The spill blackened hundreds of miles of
rocky coastline, killing hundreds of thousand of birds and
wildlife. Exxon says the cleanup has cost $2 billion.
   Hazewlood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., is the only person charged
criminally in the case. His lawyers are trying to show that the
Coast Guard's inattention may have caused the disaster, not
Hazelwood's alleged recklessness.
   Hazewlood is charged with one felony count of second-degree
criminal mischief and misdemeanor charges of reckless endangerment,
negligent discharge of oil and operating a vessel while
intoxicated. The maximum penalty for conviction on all counts is
seven years, three months in prison and $61,000 in fines.
   Both Blandford and Gordon Taylor, who concluded his testimony
Monday, said that even if they had thought Hazelwood was off
course, they lacked authority to order him to change position. They
said they would have had to defer to a commanding officer in such a
situation.
   ``Who is in the best position to navigate a tanker?'' asked Cole.
   ``Certainly the master,'' Blandford said, referring to the
captain.
   Asked to explain, he said, ``With reference to a vessel traffic
controller with radar contact, I can only see where he is in
relation to other vessels. I can't see what he can see. I know
approximaely where he is. But he is much closer to the locale and I
can't see what he sees.''

   ST-BASILE-LE-GRAND, Quebec (AP) _ U.S.-born Phil Edmonston
easily won a special parliamentary election in the Chambly district
Monday to become the first politician from the New Democratic Party
to be elected in Quebec.
   Edmonston defeated Liberal Party candidate Clifford Lincoln by
about a 70 percent to 15 percent margin, according to results late
Monday from nearly all of the 194 polling stations. Lincoln needed
a victory to boost his campaign for the national Liberal
leadership; four other candidates polled marginal returns.
   Known as a consumer advocate, Edmonston overcame allegations in
the final days of the campaign that he had accepted kickbacks in
the 1970s.
   His triumph was considered all the more remarkable because
Edmonston, born in Washington, D.C., 45 years ago and a U.S. armed
forces veteran who served 2{ years in Panama, speaks French with a
strong American accent. The Chambly constituency is overwhelmingly
Francophone and traditionally nationalist.
   ``Quebec is a province where people are very tolerent,'' said
Edmonston, who was greeted by a rousing version of the Quebec
nationalist anthem Gens du pays. Residents of Quebec accept people
of ethnic and cultural backgrounds, ``but French must be first,''
Edmonston added.
   He failed in earlier attempts to get a seat in the federal
Parliament in a special election in 1977 and in 1988 general
elections.
   Said Lincoln, ``I accept my defeat, but life continues.''

   Angry black students carrying the banner
``Keep The Dream Alive'' marched out of Selma High School on
Monday, ending a five-day sit-in, but decided they wouldn't return
to class when the school reopens.
   In another development, a federal judge turned down the city's
request to halt a sit-in at City Hall in this landmark city of the
civil rights era.
   Mayor Joe Smitherman announced that all schools would reopen
Tuesday, but the racial protest that brought public education to a
halt last week seemed far from resolved. Some white parents said
they were transferring children to other school systems.
   Superintendent Norward Roussell, whose dismissal at the end the
school year sparked the protests, ordered teachers to report at
7:15 a.m. Tuesday and predicted that about 70 percent of the school
system's 6,000 students would be in class.
   ``I anticipate some of our students will not show up tomorrow,
but we will have students tomorrow and we will have regular classes
for those students,'' Roussell said Monday.
   More than 100 black students who took part in the sit-in voted
Monday night to march to the high school when it reopened Tuesday,
but said they wouldn't attend classes.
   The students met in the basement of First Baptist Church while
more than 300 adults sat upstairs singing hymns.
   After the vote, Roussell told the parents and students it was
their decision how to react to schools reopening, but added, ``I
didn't come here to be superintendent over empty classrooms and
closed schools.''
   U.S. District Judge Charles Butler of Mobile, after hearing
arguments partly through a telephone hookup, refused earlier in the
day to grant a temporary restraining order against the black
protesters in Selma.
   However, he said he would reconsider the order if continued
protests interfered with school and City Hall activities.
   On the steps of City Hall, Smitherman said Monday afternoon that
officials felt public schools could safely reopen Tuesday. ``I will
have adequate law enforcement at each school to ensure the safety
of the children,'' he said.
   His statement was greeted by ``boos'' from a few dozen black
protesters in the crowd.
   Roussell predicted about 70 percent of the students would show
up Tuesday.
   About 150 students paraded Monday morning from the high school
to City Hall, where they briefly packed corridors, then most
departed. About 25 adults and students continued a City Hall sit-in
that began six days ago.
   Roussell was reinstated a week ago as rising racial tensions
forced the school closings, but the board has declined to extend
his contract beyond its June expiration. Roussell and his
supporters say the board opposes him because of his race, not his
alleged lack of managerial skills cited in an evaluation.
   The five black members of the 11-member Selma Board of Education
announced their resignations after the initial vote not to extend
Roussell's contract. Protesters also want the school board to be
elective rather than appointed by the City Council, which has five
whites and four blacks.
   Roussell spoke with student leaders of the high school sit-in
Monday, shortly before their parade.
   ``He felt it was in our best interest to leave. Plus, the school
board would fire him if we didn't leave,'' said student protester
Latima Salaam.
   Roussell confirmed that the white members of the school board
threatened to fire him if he did not expel students continuing the
sit-in. He said he would not expel them, but he did not rule out
lesser disciplinary action.
   Joe Pickard, a white member of the school board and a former
superintendent, said he was not aware of any threat to fire
Roussell if he did not expel the protesting students.
   ``I know nothing about such a statement to him whatsoever,''
Pickard said.
   The racial tensions and shutdown of the school system has
prompted some white parents to transfer their children.
   Sandra Knapp Sewell was among them, transferring her daughter,
Melissa, to Prattville. ``I'm leaving a place I've lived in 45
years to make sure she has a safe place to go to school,'' said
Mrs. Sewell.
   Black student protesters did not immediately say what their next
step would be. Most returned to the high school, picked up their
sleeping bags and went home. Ms. Salaam said the students would
meet Monday night.
   City Attorney Henry Pitts urged Butler to issue an order
prohibiting the protesters from ``totally paralyzing city
government.'' He said the dispute does not involve the human rights
that were at stake in 1965, when the Selma-to-Montgomery march
helped blacks gain voting rights.
   J.L. Chestnut, a black attorney in Selma, said, ``We don't think
some blanket injunction barring our people from the seat of
government should be granted.'' He said fundamental rights to
peaceful assembly would be violated.
   By noon, after about 150 students marched from Selma High
School, all but about 25 adult and student protesters were gone
from City Hall, which reopened its offices. When the student
marchers first jammed inside, all the offices closed, except for
Smitherman's. Several police officers guarded his door.

   Seated in a Johannesburg television studio a few
feet from an African National Congress leader, South Africa's
Foreign Minister Pik Botha on Monday night described followers of
the black guerrilla movement as ``my friends.''
   The ANC's Ahmed Kathrada, released a year ago after 26 years in
jail, said nothing really had changed, but he didn't doubt the
sincerity or integrity of the white government leaders.
   His face lined and somber, Jeff Masomola of the smaller,
militant black nationalist Pan African Congress dismissed
negotiations as futile. Only immediate universal suffrage for the
5-1 black majority, he said, ``will result in the taking over of
this country by the people who own it.''
   And veteran white liberal politician Helen Suzman chided Botha
for ``making the sort of speeches I made 30 years ago.''
   All were guests on the British Broadcasting Corp.'s ``Panorama''
current affairs program beamed live from Johannesburg in what the
network said was the first such appearance by South African leaders
from across almost the entire political spectrum.
   It came a day after ANC head Nelson Mandela, considered by many
of South Africa's blacks to be their leader, was released after 27
years in prison.
   Only the far-right white opposition Conservative Party refused
to come to the studio because its followers object to sitting in a
room with members of the ANC.
   Conservative Party spokesman Koos van der Merwe made his
contribution in a separate recording. ``He (Nelson Mandela) came
out of that jail without having given in one inch of his demands,''
said van der Merwe. ``They are not interested in peace or
democracy. They want complete capitulation of the white people.''
   No one raised their voices or interrupted throughout the near

apartheid, blacks were now supposed to help allay white fears.

   Iran's official Islamic Republic News
Agency said Monday that Soviet Moslems in troubled Azerbaijan
province celebrated the 11th anniversary of the Islamic revolution
that brought the Shiite Moslem clergy to power in Tehran.
   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, said Soviet Moslems gathered along
the border Sunday, the culmination of the 10-day celebrations
marking the anniversary, and shouted Islamic slogans.
   It said did not say how many people assembled across the Aras
River near the border city of Poldasht in Iran's East Azarbaijan
province.
   The area is in Nakhichevan, an Azerbaijani enclave bordered by
Armenia, Iran and Turkey.

religion with their Iranian cousins. Azerbaijan was once completely
ruled by Iran, but was divided in 1828.

Azerbaijan for closer links with Iran.

   Margaret Thatcher said Monday after meeting with
Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki of Poland that Britain will help
the Warsaw government try to solve its economic problems.
   The two also discussed German unification and the consequences
for Europe at a meeting that lasted more than two hours, a
spokesman for the British prime minister said.
   Next week in Paris, Poland will ask Western governments to
reschedule and ease its $39 billion foreign debt burden.
   Mrs. Thatcher congratulated Mazowiecki on his handling of
Poland's transition from a communist to a free-market economy since
he became prime minister last August, and he thanked Britain for
its help.
   Mrs. Thatcher later told reporters Britain wanted to see German
unification accomplished with security and stability in Poland.
   Poland's borders should be guaranteed by treaty, she said.
   Part of Poland's territory once belonged to Germany. Polish
officials have expressed concern that moves toward German unity
could threaten boundaries.
   Mrs. Thatcher said Britain would consider giving more help to
Poland.

   Saluting the very worst in motion pictures,
the Golden Raspberry Foundation on Monday announced the nominees

   The latter film received a top six Razzie nominations, followed
by ``Karate Kid III'' with five selections, ``Road House'' with
four, and ``Lock-Up,'' ``The Lonely Lady'' and ``Mommie Dearest''

states, with additional members in Canada and Switzerland, said a

   Perrier says it plans to destroy its
entire U.S. inventory of bottled mineral water _ about 72 million
bottles _ because a small amount of poisonous benzene was found in
some samples.
   The company has also shut down its France-based bottling
operation and directed its distributors to pull the water from
stores' shelves, said Ronald V. Davis, president of the
Greenwich-based Perrier Group of America Inc., which distributes
the bottled water in the United States.
   The head of the Food and Drug Administration said the levels
detected pose a ``negligible'' health risk.
   ``If I had a bottle in the refrigerator, I would drink it,''

   President Bush says it is a time for
``rejoicing'' over Nelson Mandela's freedom after 27 years in South
African prisons, but not for deciding whether to keep up stiff U.S.
sanctions on the country's white minority-ruled regime.
   Bush telephoned the newly liberated black leader on Sunday and
invited him to visit the White House. Afterwards, Bush had only
words of praise for both Mandela and the man who freed him, South
African President F.W. de Klerk.
   ``I'm not prepared to express my views on sanctions at this
time,'' Bush told reporters in the Rose Garden.
   Asked if he believed it was the sanctions that prompted de
Klerk's decision to release Mandela, Bush replied, ``Maybe so. I
don't know.''

   Capping a week of high-profile and
apparently successful European diplomacy, Secretary of State James
A. Baker III is sounding out NATO allies on how to shape an accord
with Moscow to withdraw a half-million U.S. and Soviet troops from
the continent.
   Baker's sessions at a NATO-Warsaw Pact ``Open Skies'' conference
in the Canadian capital could extend a skein of arms control
breakthroughs that marked his four days of talks in Moscow last
week.
   The United States and Soviet Union now stand on the brink of
treaties to slash their chemical weapons and long-range nuclear
missiles.
   And if the talks with allies and a session today with Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze pan out, the differences
between President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on
troop cuts can be worked out.

plans to meet top Philippine military officials on the future of
U.S. forces in the unsettled country.
   Cheney, here on the opening leg of a two-week tour of Asian

   Cheney scheduled a full day of sessions with U.S. military
chiefs from the Army, Navy and Air Force as well as touring a

   James ``Buster'' Douglas wore a world heavyweight
championship belt after his stunning knockout of Mike Tyson, but
two of boxing's governing bodies are investigating whether the
underdog was knocked out first.
   The title is in limbo while the World Boxing Association and
World Boxing Council review film of Sunday's bout to determine if a
``long count'' let Douglas stay in the match after Tyson decked him
in the eighth round.
   Only the International Boxing Federation, which sanctioned the
bout as a championship match, declared Douglas the winner.
   Douglas' supporters in his hometown of Columbus, Ohio, had no
doubts, and they planned to give him a hero's welcome upon his
return today.
   ``The man won fair and square,'' Mayor Dana Rinehart said.
``He's won it in the eyes of the world. This is his hometown, and
we're going to roll out the red carpet for him.'' Rinehart said
there would be a parade after Douglas got a day or two of rest.

   Unless California gets rains of biblical
proportions in the next two months, a drought will enter its fourth
year, forcing one city to outlaw lawn-watering and others to
require serious water cutbacks.
   Los Angeles is drafting a water conservation incentive program,
farmers in Turlock are using well water to offset reservoir
shortages and merchants along shrunken Folsom Lake near Sacramento
are bracing for a decline in visitors.
   The state's precipitation stood at 60 percent of normal on Feb.
1 for the rainy season beginning Oct. 1, 1989. The 154 largest
reservoirs were at 74 percent capacity and the water content in the
snow pack was at 40 to 50 percent of normal, officials said.
   If California has even normal rainfall in February and March,
officials will declare the fourth consecutive drought year, said
Bob Fingado, senior engineer with the state Water Resources
Department.

   What happens when the cheering stops, when an
athlete is told it's time to hang it up, when the Big Show is over?
For most, it's devastating. As former tennis champ Arthur Ashe once
wrote, ``retirement can only mean we are thereafter lesser men.''

   Professional athletes die twice.
   ``It's so,'' says Lee Lacy. ``When you are told the only life
you know and love is over, it's the same as telling you you are
dead and gone.''
   For 16 years Lee Lacy ran and threw and slid with joyful abandon
on three major league baseball teams. Today, at 41, he retains his
athlete's physique but has gained, or so he says, a middle-age
maturity. Even so, he refuses to accept a death sentence.
   Few athletes ever do. Especially, perhaps, prizefighters, whose
overdue decisions to hang 'em up often are only slightly less
painful to faithful fans who avert their eyes in sorrow at the
ultimate ignominy.
   But denial extends to less brutal pursuits as well. Arthur Ashe,
the former tennis champion offers an explanation and insists that
``a little like dying'' is more than metaphor.
   ``We have defined our masculinity in terms of our athletic
prowess,'' he once wrote, ``and retirement can only mean we are
thereafter lesser men.''
   Lesser men. At an age that most adults consider the prime of
life.
   Laying aside the artifacts of their prowess, their spikes and
gloves and rackets, is not all they leave behind. Athletes have
taken over from cowboys and movie stars and even astronauts as
America's most glamorous heroes, certainly the highest paid. What
they leave is more than a game, and the leaving thus more painful
than for mere mortals.
   ``It's the nature of the adulation,'' football star Jim Brown
recently told an interviewer. ``It's so overwhelming, the thrill
you get, the cheers you hear, the lifestyle you can afford. Your
head gets bigger without your even realizing it.''
   The years seem to pass without their realizing it as well. Many
athletes, notably those who play team sports, argue that their
ability to go just one more inning should determine their
longevity, not the presence of some younger hotshot on the bench.
   ``Why should there be a cutoff date?'' asks Toby Harrah, whose
17-year baseball career included four all-star games.
   Harrah, lithe and leather tough at 42, recalls the words of
Satchel Paige, whose playing days, some guessed, stretched into his
60s: ``How can you tell how old you are if you don't know?''
   ``You have to remember,'' said Harrah, ``that our careers began
not when we got out of college or even high school but back when we
were 6 or 7 years old. So when you're told you're through while you
still feel fit and confident, it's like being hit by a train.''
   Toby Harrah and Lee Lacy are two among 200 other former major
league baseball players who also had once been pronounced dead on
arrival _ at spring training camp, as in Lacy's case, or when they
came up with a bum leg or a sore arm or a slow bat.
   Naturally, none of them accepted the verdict as final.
   Instead, all of them heeded a siren's song inviting former major
leaguers 35 and older to come to Florida, land of the Fountain of
Youth, and play baseball once again, this time in the Senior
Professional Baseball Association.
   The league, its first three-month winter season just ended, was
the brainstorm of an entrepreneur willing to bet, as were his aging
recruits, on baseball philosopher Yogi Berra's pronouncement that
the game ain't over 'til it's over.
   Like Harrah, Lacy insists that ``that's something a ballplayer
ought to be allowed to decide for himself,'' acknowledging that
such a notion probably was a pipe dream. ``Well, why not? Playing
in the majors was a dream come true in the first place,'' he said.
   One of the senior league's luminaries, ex-Yankee Graig Nettles,
is also a dreamer. Said Nettles when he joined the league, ``If I
can stay in baseball, I may never have to grow up.''
   Lacy and Harrah both played for the West Palm Beach Tropics, who
wound up winning their Southern Division title but losing in a
championship game to the St. Petersburg Pelicans. Perhaps you
missed it.
   The Tropics' theme song was a Steve Winwood tune, ``Back in the
High Life Again.''
   Its promising words _ ``I'll be back in the high life again, All
the eyes that watched me once will smile and take me in ...'' _ had
a forlorn and ironic ring, however, blaring over the loudspeaker
before every home game, echoing across rows of empty seats in a
small-town ballpark that REAL major leaguers used only for spring
training.
   Lee Lacy loved the major league high life, all right, what
ballplayers call the Big Show.

   He traveled first class and slept on fine linen and left wake-up
calls and dined at tables with tapered candles and, oh, how he
savored the cheers, cheers of sellout crowds in three World Series
and in the Pittsburgh grandstands in 1984 when he led his league in
fielding and finished second in batting.
   ``My, my, my,'' Lacy said, his face cradled in a smile of sweet
memory.
   Then, last year, after 1,523 major league games, 4,549 times at
bat, 1,303 hits, 91 home runs, the Baltimore Orioles read the last
rites over Leondaus Lacy, outfielder.
   ``Somebody just told me, `Sorry, Lee, goodbye,' Lacy said. ``All
he left out was, `May you rest in peace.'''
   But Lee Lacy found no peace in the valley, a valley as dark as
his prospects for greatness had seemed back in the Oakland, Calif.,
housing project where he was raised.
   At age 7, learning from older guys, he took a match to a tennis
ball and burned off the fuzz so it resembled a baseball. What he
had lit was a career that would blaze in glory and, at a time other
professionals consider their prime, end just as unexpectedly in
ashes.
   ``I couldn't get over the shock of that,'' Lacy said. ``I
couldn't accept it. I moped around. I felt lost. I was not a
pleasant person. My wife and I started a little telephone answering
service, something to do, to feel worthwhile.
   ``But every night I prayed. I said, `Lord, if there is any
chance, any chance that I can play baseball again, let it be.'''
   Lacy reflected on his fate one evening in late January just at
nightfall, his long legs stretched out in the aisle of his team's
charter bus making its way across southern Florida. Out the window
he saw no bright lights, just a weary landscape of flat brown
canebrakes and dark flat swamps along arrow-straight roads.
   Was the answer to his prayer, then, really a minor Ephipany, a
deliverance from the Stygian twilight into one more moment in the
sun? Or was it a cruel prolonging of the inevitable agony?
   ``When they let me go, I knew in my heart I could still play
baseball,'' said Lacy. ``Now I have proved, to my own satisfaction
at least, that I was right. When the time finally comes to toss it
in I will know what to expect and will accept it.''
   Accepting it apparently is more difficult for the superstars
than for journeymen athletes.
   Brooks Robinson, who dazzled a nation of fans with his play at
third base, discovered, on retirement at age 40, that ``the only
thing worse than being down and out is going up and down and out.''
   ``The big thing is that you don't know what you're going to do
or where you're going to go,'' he said. ``The single hardest thing
about leaving is that you're leaving a love, a passion. It was my
whole life.''
   A few years later Robinson discovered another agony of a
vanished hero.
   On a visit to the Oakland A's clubhouse, wearing a suit and tie,
a clubhouse boy asked, ``Who are you?''
   ``Brooks Robinson.''
   ``Do you play ball?''
   Most athletes try to hang onto the fringes of their sport,
coaching, scouting, selling equipment. Robinson and Harrah and Al
Hrabosky, another big name on the Tropics, got into broadcasting.
But many of the former players, lesser lights, put aside jobs as
truck drivers or beer salesmen, or telephone answerers, to rush
headlong to the senior league.
   Pete Broberg is a rarity. After pitching eight years in the
majors, he went to law school in 1978 at age 30 and began a new
career. He took a leave from his practice in West Palm Beach to
join the home team ``so my children could see me play the game I
love so much.''
   ``Most players realize it would take them 20 years to learn to
do anything as well as they know how to play baseball,'' Broberg
said.
   ``Most other professionals, lawyers, doctors, brokers, at age 35
or 40 are just beginnning to feel they are competent, at the top of
their game so to speak. The same is true of athletes, at least
mentally. Yet that's the age athletes are told they're through.
That's hard to cope with. That's the sadness.''
   Rick Wolff, the director of sports books for Macmillan, did a
master's thesis on the problems athletes face at career's end. He
has developed a counseling program that leads the athlete through
the phases of denial, anger, bargaining, depression and, finally,
acceptance.
   If the program sounds familiar it is because it is based on the
model for terminally ill people from the book ``On Death and
Dying.''
   At least one line from the Tropics' anthem ``Back in the High
Life Again'' is as true, it seems, as a called strike:
   ``When you're born to run, it's so hard to just slow down ... .''
   That's the real sadness.

   Like penniless Vincent van Gogh, whose painting
``Irises'' recently sold for $54 million, one can imagine John
Goddard sitting on a cloud and numbly shaking his head over the
price of dying too soon. John Goddard? He was a Colonial
cabinetmaker credited with producing a desk-bookcase that sold last
year for $12.1 million, a record for a piece of furniture.

   Fiscally speaking, when John Goddard died
his shirt didn't quite meet his pants.
   On balance, that is, he was broke. Having 15 children may not
have helped. Too bad. Just 204 years later, a desk almost certainly
made by him sold for $11 million. Plus 10 percent commission.
   John Goddard (1723-85) was a cabinetmaker. He was also an unsung
Vincent van Gogh of mahogany. You know: Die now, get rich later.
Much later.
   In the 1760s, Goddard thought, correctly, he was making a
handsome desk-bookcase for a prominent Providence merchant, John
Nicholas Brown. He did not know he would also make tidal waves in
the antique market when Brown's descendant and namesake sold the
family heirloom through a New York auction house last June.
   The $12.1 million price tag quadrupled the previous world record
for a piece of furniture _ $2.97 million in 1988 for a Louis XVI
table once owned by Louis' queen, Marie Antoinette, before they
both went to the guillotine.
   Colonial cabinetmakers, even superstars like Goddard, didn't die
rich. Their customers did, instead. The Goddards served them in
death as in life, eking out a living in between masterpieces by
making coffins. Or hammer handles or cheap furniture for export to
the Caribbean whence came their expensive mahogany logs in return.
   Goddard's home, one of the many colonial buildings in this
antique seaport, still stands down on Second Street near Pine. So
does his shop, still attached to the three-story, gable-roofed
house. It's about as big as a one-car garage. If the car is a
compact.
   John Alden, the Mayflower immigrant, was the first cabinetmaker
in the Colonies. His product was crude as a broadax, rough-hewn for
the ages. As the Colonies prospered, hardscrabble utility began
surrendering to refinement. Quality furniture became a confirmation
of status, gentility, money.
   Wealth in the Colonies concentrated in the seaports.
Philadelphia, second largest city in the British Empire, was the
capital of cabinetmaking. Newport by the mid-18th century was
growing to 11,000 inhabitants, had more than 50 rum distilleries
and a growing class of entrepreneurs who were becoming rich in the
triangular trade of rum-slaves-sugar cane.
   Newport also had a family tribe of Quakers named Townsend and
Goddard. Three generations of Townsends and Goddards intermarried
nuptially and vocationally, producing a line of some 20
cabinetmakers and a golden age of furniture, wooden Parthenons for
the drawing rooms of the rich and famous who could afford the best
and found it, providentially, within walking distance.
   John Goddard was born in Dartmouth, Mass., son of a shipwright,
one of the crafts along with homebuilding that were to spawn the
Colonial cabinetmakers. By age 20 he was master of the sloop
Bashsheda plying between Philadelphia and Newport. In 1746 he
married Hannah, daughter of local cabinetmaker Job Townsend.
Goddard's brother, James, also married a daughter of Job's. The
brothers began to learn ``the art, trade and mystery'' of
cabinetmaking.
   The first good furniture in America was either British imports
or copied from English books of design such as Thomas Chippendale's
1754 landmark, ``The Gentleman and Cabinetmaker's Director.''
Gradually each of the American ports evolved its own style.
   Philadelphia's was the most elegant and richly carved. New York
was an unadorned and ``put it there'' kind of town, and so was its
furniture. Boston was already declining as a seaport. This produced
a frugal style that resisted change as well as ostentation. And in
Newport, which had 67 cabinetmakers during the century, the best,
remember, were Quakers.
   The tools of the trade were almost Cro-Magnonian by today's
workshop standards.
   ``All you needed were sharp planes, saws and chisels,'' says
Robert Emlen, the curator who shipped Goddard's desk off the
auction block. ``They finished wood with scrapers, pumice and
rottenstone or sharkskin. But for that you had to find a shark.''
   ``Screws were expensive, and they were only used where
absolutely needed,'' says Jeff Moore, who restores furniture for
the Newport Preservation Society. ``They used hide glue _ it's
still holding. Blacksmiths made files. And they had molding planes
and jointer planes and rifflers and sandpaper made out of crushed
glass glued to paper. They weren't fools. They did it the easy way
wherever they could.''
   Humbler woods were used where they wouldn't be seen. But the
visible mahogany surfaces were flawlessly carved and dovetailed.
   Future cabinetmakers apprenticed for seven years beginning at
about age 13. After the dog work, they became journeymen, traveling
from job to job until they acquired enough rifflers and planes and
sharks to open their own shops. Roughly, it took a journeyman eight
days to make a 4-foot table, six days for a plain desk, 22 days for
a highboy.

   Each city's style became subtly distinctive, an aid for future
antiquarians since few pieces in the Chippendale era were signed.
It was an anonymous business presumably because everybody knew who
made what. Ball-and-claw feet were squared off at the bottom in New
York, carved with pronounced knuckles in Philadelphia, without
webbing between the talons in Newport.
   The Townsends and Goddards became known for their block-front
furniture, convex panels surrounding a third concave panel and
topped with a carved scallop shell, a common adornment, along with
stars and radiating suns. It was a style that came to Newport from
Italy by way of Boston.
   Customarily, several crafts contributed to a block front
desk-bookcase: the lathe turner, the brass hardware maker,
sometimes the carver. They would turn over their pieces to the
cabinetmaker, who put them all together and got credit for the
final product. So it was, presumably, with John Goddard's $12.1
million block-front desk, although he probably did the carving
himself.
   Actually, no one is positive Goddard made the desk. It is
unsigned. ``It's a reasonably good bet he made it, but we're not
sure,'' says Emlen.
   Aside from the distinctive touches, there are letters in
evidence between Goddard and the Brown family, which was of such
importance and munificence that the College of Rhode Island became
Brown University in their honor. A 1763 letter to Goddard from
Nicholas's brother, Moses, accuses the cabinetmaker of being behind
on an order and of working for another client when he should have
been finishing Brown's furniture.
   Goddard, the Quaker, wrote back, hat respectfully in hand, that
Moses should understand he had ``to keep my boys Imploy'd ... so I
hope thou will think better of thy friend.'' He went on to describe
a ``Chest on Chest of Drawers and a Sweld (block) front which are
Costly and ornimental.''
   Such a costly and ornamental desk-bookcase, now known as a
secretary, might have sold for 400 pounds. Nicholas left at his
death in 1791 a ``bookcase with books'' _ probably the future
record-breaker _ valued at 95 pounds in the widely fluctuating
currency. But it was high for its times.
   There were 10 such desks made in all. One burned in a fire.
Eight are in museums. The Brown desk remained in the family from
the day it was made, about 1767. In fact, when it was moved to the
ultimate Brown home in Providence in 1814, it left there only
twice, both in this century to appear on exhibit.
   When he died, Goddard left ``all my stock of mahogany'' to his
sons ``to be worked up for the support of my wife and minor
children.'' A year later the Newport Mercury carried a sad epitaph,
a notice that said Goddard, ``represented insolvent ... all those
indebted to said estate are desired to make immediate Payment ...
.'' And so he faded into obscurity.
   The desk, meanwhile, passed down through the eldest Brown sons,
gradually acquiring the status of a ``family icon,'' says Emlen,
``a pinnacle of the family fortune. The Browns had the means to
change the interior decor every 20 or so years, but the desk always
remained.''
   The desk for years had received little more notoriety than
Goddard himself. Then in 1913 it was mentioned in Vincent
Lockwood's ``Colonial Furniture in America.'' Goddard became
similarly resurrected, as were his town and his works.
   Newport had been invaded by the British during the Revolution.
Four hundred homes were torn down for firewood. In the aftermath,
the town languished, its motto being ``Eat it up, make it do, do
without.'' In this environment, old furniture stayed at home and
out of antique shops. But as the mahogany took on the blood-maroon,
glowing patina of age, the cabinetmakers of Newport were recalled
from their graves as ``craftsmen (whose) output in quality, design
and originality (was) unsurpassed by any other urban or rural
setting throughout the world.''
   Almost 10 feet in height, the Goddard desk rose above the
finicky, precious details of the auction house catalog: ``molded
scroll pediment ... fluted urn flame finials ... stop-fluted
quarter columns ... shell-covered prospect door ... scroll-carved
bracket foot ....''
   The desk was bought by a leading New York antiques dealer,
reportedly for young members of the wealthy Bass family of Fort
Worth, Texas, who have begun collecting American antiques.
   Meanwhile, Emlen has asked a cabinetmaker in Maine to make a
replica of the desk, using the same primitive tools, for the Brown
center.
   ``I don't know yet what it will cost, but the estimate is
$35,000.''
   Roughly 900 Colonial pounds, say, a fair amount of spermaceti
candles. But maybe John Goddard's hands, like Van Gogh's, were
reaching for something far beyond the marketplace.

   Since 1813 it has been turning out equipment and
weapons for America's fighting men, from powder horns to battleship
guns. Now, with peace breaking out, the fortress-like Watervliet
Arsenal in upstate New York is once again looking for some other
kind of work.

   It's like V-E Day all over again for the
last of the country's cannon factories.
   The easing of Soviet-American tensions in Eastern Europe and
expected cutbacks in military spending signal a further eroding of
demand for artillery made at the 177-year-old Watervliet Arsenal
near Albany, the Army's big-gun shop.
   ``Like any military person, I welcome peace,'' says Col. Joseph
Mayton Jr., arsenal commander.
   But peace can mean red ink when your job is making the
heavy-hitters that paved the way for American troops in five wars
and many skirmishes in the last century.
   Resembling a fortress behind its spiked, wrought-iron fence, the
arsenal sells about $150 million in cannons and mortars a year,
mostly to the Army. It turns out 200 to 250 cannons and mortars a
month, its biggest seller a 120mm gun for the Army's Abrams M-1
tank, which may fall victim to President Bush's pared-back defense
budget.
   Since the last troops left Vietnam in 1975, the arsenal has had
to ``go out looking for other work,'' says arsenal spokesman John
Swantek.
   The plant has made bridges for the Marines, and its forge can
``fabricate nearly anything out of metal'' that requires
high-precision tooling and low-production volume, Mayton says.
   One of its hottest new lines are towbars for military vehicles,
a far cry from the 16-inch guns the arsenal fashioned for
battleships in World War II.
   Among the last of those 16-inch guns _ the biggest the arsenal
ever turned out _ was the one that exploded aboard the USS Iowa
last April, killing 47 sailors. A Navy investigation blamed the
explosion aboard the battleship on sabotage by a disgruntled sailor
who died in the blast.
   The arsenal no longer makes cannons that big, but as long as
humans know how to make war, the demand for big guns will be there,
Swantek says.
   ``With all of the euphoria of what's going on in Eastern Europe,
then something happens like in Panama _ and I'm sure there were
Watervliet Arsenal cannons down there with them,'' Mayton says.
   About 10 Army staffers oversee the arsenal, housed in 72
buildings, but the rest of the 2,350 workers are civilians. An
arsenal employing about 2,700 in Rock Island, Ill., makes carriages
for howitzers produced in Watervliet.
   Employment at Watervliet peaked at 10,000 during World War II.
   A 10-year, $350 million renovation has brought the latest in
cannon technology to the arsenal, including a laser-guided boring
system and robotics machinery that has automated many tasks.
   While that has eliminated the need for some jobs, it's the
``ebbs and flows'' of war and peace that dictate employment,
Swantek says. The arsenal will cut about 100 jobs a year through
retirements and other voluntary departures so long as the peace
lasts, he says.
   A few years before World War II, employment had dropped to about
140 and ``there was talk about closing the arsenal'' and putting
its 140 acres to other uses, says William Bradford, curator of the
arsenal's museum.
   ``In peacetime, people have said, `Say, that 140 acres would
make a nice hospital or a nice school.' Then unfortunately, along
comes another war and people are glad they didn't close it,''
Swantek says.
   The War Department opened the arsenal in 1813 to make powder
horns, bullet pouches, sword scabbards and other equipment. The
government chose Watervliet because of its location near the Hudson
and Mohawk rivers. From Watervliet, Army supplies could be easily
shipped to western and northeastern New York, where the British
were likely to attack from forts in Canada.
   The arsenal was converted to cannon production in the 1880s when
``there were already rumblings about what was to come in Europe,''
Swantek says.
   Fearing an attack from Europe, the Army ordered large,
long-range cannons placed along the Atlantic Coast. Until the
arsenal began making cannons, the Army's big guns were mostly made
by private companies copying European weapons, Bradford says. Those
companies often did shoddy work, and to set up its seacoast
defense, the United States needed its own research and production
area, he says.
   While the invasion never came, the research effort put the
United States at the front lines of artillery production, just in
time for the wars in Europe.
   Among the arsenal's chiefs was Col. J. Walker Benet _ father of
author Stephen Vincent Benet _ who commanded the arsenal from 1919
to 1921. The arsenal's research center, the Benet Laboratory, is
named for him.
   After the wars, strained relations between the United States and
Soviet Union kept the arsenal forges turning out cannons to defend
Western Europe. Soviet cannon factories churned out their own guns
to point west.
   A drawing hangs in the arsenal's quarter-mile-long ``big gun
shop'' showing a Soviet cannon plant superimposed over the
Watervliet facility. The Soviet plant is more than twice the size _
and it's just one of three in the Soviet arsenal, Swantek says.
   A past commander at Watervliet hung the drawing to show arsenal
workers that although it was peacetime, they still were fighting
the Cold War, he says.
   With arms production slowing, research on improved weapons
continues at Benet Laboratory, says research director Larry
Johnson. Much of the lab's work deals with better production
methods that could be used in other industries, he says.
   But the main goal is to build a better cannon, which will remain
a big part of the conventional weapons arsenal for at least 25
years, he says.
   ``There's two ways of settling arguments, nuclear deterrents or
conventional deterrents,'' he says. ``With conventional weapons,
people get hurt, but it's not terminal to our countries.''
   If old-fashioned artillery warfare breaks out, the arsenal has a
plan to step up production and mobilize private industry to begin
producing cannons within a year.
   ``You hope the peace business goes on,'' Swantek says, ``but you
have to wonder how many ebbs and flows will there have been a
hundred years from now?''

   Stock prices fell sharply in morning trading
Monday.
   Contributing to the retreat, traders said, were further falls on
West German and British bond markets, which increased bond yields
and redirected investment from equities into gilts.
   At the same time, dealers noted increasing concern that the West
German Bundesbank might raise interest rates as a means of keeping
a tight lid on inflation pressures fueled by prospects of German
unification.
   ``Trading is very light and very few large investors are
prepared to get involved,'' said one dealer. ``Everyone is hoping
that a clearer domestic and international picture is going to
emerge.''
   At about noon in London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was 15.6 points, 0.6 percent, lower at 2,298.0
points,.
   At midday, volume was an extremely thin 176 million shares
compared with 318.6 million shares at the same time Friday.

<HEAD>More Salaried Cuts at Chrysler</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A move by Chrysler Corp. to cut more salaried
workers should be well received on Wall Street today, a day before
the automaker reports marginal or no profit for the 1989 fourth
quarter, an analyst said.
   Chrysler on Sunday confirmed that it had begun a second round of
cuts among its white-collar work force. Spokesman Steve Harris said
there was no target number.
   ``White-collar reductions are becoming a way of life at
Chrysler,'' Harris said by telephone from suburban Detroit. ``A
certain part will come through attrition.''
   Auto analyst Steve Girsky of Paine Webber Inc. said Sunday from
New York the news is likely to get a good reception today because
it ``sends a signal that they are serious about trimming down.''
   Analysts have estimated that each of the Big Three _ General
Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler _ will report sharply
lower 1989 earnings compared with 1988.
   For the final quarter, they forecast, Chrysler would report
tiny, if any, earnings.
   Chrysler announced a cost-cutting program last October with an
original goal of carving $1 billion from its $26-billion annual
budget by the end of this year. Since then, the company has boosted
that target to $1.5 billion.
   Included were the eliminations of 2,300 salaried jobs, or about
8 percent of the white-collar work force. Automotive News, a weekly
industry journal, quoted sources in today's editions as saying the
new cuts would involve 5 percent to 10 percent of the salaried work
force.
   If the reduction falls between those two estimates, Chrysler
will slice 4,600 jobs, or about 15 percent, from its pre-October
salaried employment level.
   Chrysler is cutting its costs as the auto industry wrestles with
a slumping market and too much production capacity. In addition to
the staff cuts, the company shut down its Jefferson Avenue car
assembly plant in Detroit, planned to close its St. Louis car
assembly plant this September and cut out some expensive incentives.
   ``It's a question of can this company hold its market share,''
Girsky said. ``If you're going to buy market share (through
incentive use), let's hope you're a low-cost producer.''
   GM and Ford have said they, like Chrysler, constantly are
reviewing their employment levels. In 1987, GM began ``Action
Plan,'' to cut costs. Since then, its original target has been
raised to $13 billion by 1991.
   Ford has no formal cost-cutting plan like those at GM and
Chrysler.
   Analyst Thomas O'Grady, president of Integrated Automotive
Resources Inc. in Wayne, Pa., said Sunday Chrysler's savings must
be put to good use.
   ``What I would be concerned about is what they are doing with
the savings,'' he said. ``If it is just to have a better bottom
line, that's not so good.''
   He suggested that the company funnel the money into product
development. Harris didn't say where the savings would be sent.
   In other Chrysler news Sunday, Dodge dealers said the company
will do a test production run of less than 100 Dodge Viper sports
cars. The vehicles, a simplified two-seater with few of the
electronic gadgets in some of today's performance cars, was first
shown as a concept car 13 months ago.

<TEXT>
   The Digital Equipment Corp. reportedly plans to
sell its computers and services in Hungary under a joint venture
with two Hungarian partners.
   Digital will announce the venture Tuesday in Budapest, The
Boston Globe reported today.
   Sales at first will be aimed at users of Digital equipment
installed in Hungary before then-President Jimmy Carter in 1980
imposed strict controls on exports to Eastern Bloc nations after
the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.
   Clifford Clarke, Digital manager of international trade and
policy, said the company wants to take advantage of Hungary's
campaign to become a Western-style democracy with a free market
economy.
   Digital also expects an easing of export controls.
   Called Digital Equipment (Hungary) Ltd., the venture will begin
April 2 in Budapest with about 30 employees.
   Digital will own 51 percent. Hungarian partners, Szamalk, a
software company; and KFKI, a research institute that is part of
Hungary's National Academy of Science, will split equally 49
percent.
   Clarke said Digital hopes to supply a demand resulting from a
planned rebuilding of Hungary's telecommunications, financial
services and power generation and distribution.
   Digital is based in Maynard, Mass.

   The stock market drifted lower today, backing
off after last week's advance.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 7.88 to 2,640.32
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 8 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 370 up, 567 down and

   Big Board volume came to 14.63 million shares as of 10 a.m. on
Wall Street.
   Activity was curtailed, as expected, by a national holiday in
Japan and the absence of some U.S. investors observing the
Lincoln's Birthday holiday.
   Analysts said traders had been encouraged by the results of the
Treasury's auction of notes and bonds last week, which generally
went off better than had been expected. That provided some relief
from recent worries over rising interest rates.
   But many market participants remained edgy over the outlook for
rates in other leading industrialized countries.
   For several weeks now Wall Streeters have been worrying that
rising rates overseas would push U.S. rates higher as well,
increasing the chances of a recession.

<HEAD>Georgia-Pacific Sells Facilities to Eliminate Antitrust Question</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIRK BEVERIDGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Georgia-Pacific Corp. said today it was
selling safety-paper operations in Vermont and Iowa to remove an
antitrust question in its attempt to buy Great Northern Nekoosa
Corp.
   The Atlanta-based company said it would sell facilities in
Gilman, Vt., and Burlington, Iowa, to Seattle-based Simpson Paper
Co., for an undisclosed price.
   The Gilman plant makes safety paper, which is used in personal
checks and securities certificates, and the Burlington plant
converts and processes the paper.
   In a federal lawsuit in Bridgeport, Conn., Great Northern claims
Georgia-Pacific's $3.8 billion hostile tender offer would run afoul
of antitrust laws in the check-paper business and other areas.
   ``The sale of our safety paper business is an unwelcome step to
facilitate our acquisition of Great Northern Nekoosa Corp.,''
Georgia-Pacific Chairman T. Marshall Hahn Jr. said in a statement.
   ``We couldn't risk delaying or losing a pro-competitive $3.8
billion acquisition because of an adverse court decision regarding
assets with a value of less than 1 percent of the transaction at
issue.''
   The announcement came as Georgia-Pacific and Great Northern
prepared to fight another round in U.S. District Court in Portland
today. Great Northern was expected to ask U.S. District Judge Gene
Carter to block Georgia-Pacific's merger attempt as well as its
efforts to oust the Great Northern board at a special shareholders
meeting set for March 2 in Portland.
   Great Northern says Georgia-Pacific's takeover attempt should be
stopped because Georgia-Pacific allegedly has sought to conceal
plans to sell the Great Northern mills in Millinocket and East
Millinocket, as well as 2.1 million acres of Maine woodlands, if
the merger is successful.

<TEXT>
   Perrier resumed bottling mineral water today and a
company spokesman said human error probably had caused the benzene
contamination that forced the recall of about 72 million bottles in
Canada and the United States.
   ``All tests at the end of the production line have been
negative,'' spokesman Jean-Claude Lemaignen said after bottling
returned to normal.
   Company officials believe only 13 bottles were contaminated with
the poisonous chemical, he said. But the company has said all
recalled bottles will be destroyed.
   Exports of the product to the United States and Canada would
resume more rapidly than planned, in the next week or two,
Lemaignen said. Earlier, the company had said its product might be
off the market for months.
   Source Perrier SA halted production of its mineral water over
the weekend and withdrew bottles from North American store shelves
after the contamination was discovered.
   French newspaper reports estimated that the contamination
problem would cost the company $40 million in lost revenues.
   Trading in shares of the company on the French stock exchange
was suspended several times today before resuming just after midday
with prices down $41 dollars a share from Friday's close.
   Perrier Chairman Frederik Zimmer said human error was to blame
for the entry of the benzene into the bottling process at the plant
in Vergeze in southern France.
   That theory ``will be confirmed in the next 24 to 48 hours,''
Lemaignen said.
   He said an employee had used a product containing benzene to
clean some grease from one bottling line, whose production was
destined only for North America.
   A spokesman for the French Health Ministry confirmed there was
no contamination at the spring from which the sparkling water
flows. The government tests the source regularly and the last one
was at the end of 1989, the ministry said.
   Benzene is a clear, flammable poison used as a solvent for fats
and in making lacquers, varnishes and dyes. At high enough doses,
it has been linked to cancer in animals.
   The head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said the
levels detected in Perrier pose a ``negligible'' health risk.
   ``If I had a bottle in the refrigerator, I would drink it,''
said acting FDA Commissioner James Benson.
   The bubbly water, sold in green bottles, has acquired great
popularity in the United States as an upscale soft drink. The
company estimates annual U.S. sales at $150 million.
   FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit said the agency has confirmed levels
of benzene in Perrier samples at two to four times the
Environmental Protection Agency's standard for drinking water. The
standard is 5 parts per billion, and the levels found ranged from
12 to 20 parts per billion, he said.
   The elevated levels were found last month by North Carolina
health officials during routine testing and the FDA later confirmed
the findings.
   However, Nesbit said the FDA's health evaluation board
``concluded that there is no immediate health risk. ... People can
continue drinking Perrier.''
   ``These are fairly low levels and there's a negligible risk
involved here,'' he said.
   A lifetime of drinking water with these levels of benzene would
increase the risk of cancer by one in a million, he said.
   Despite the low health risk, the company felt its actions were
needed to restore consumer confidence. ``We're in the integrity
business, selling purity and quality,'' said Ronald V. Davis,
president of the Greenwich-based Perrier Group of America Inc.,
which distributes the bottled water in the United States.
   He said the company will offer refunds to customers, and has
established a toll-free telephone line for complaints or inquiries.
   ``We believe our decision is right because we think in the long
run our consumers will come back,'' he said. ``In the short run, it
will impact us very, very negatively.''

   Grand Metropolitan PLC, the British food and

by forming two separate companies to manage its pubs and
restaurants.
   The new pub company will run the Chef and Brewer, Clifton Inns
and Berni operations, while the restaurant company will handle Old

Met said.
   The move will mean significant savings within the retail
division, said the group, which owns Pillsbury Co. of the United
States.
   About 70 pubs and restaurants will be put up for sale, and about
300 office jobs will be lost, Grand Met said.
   Last year, a report by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
said brewers should be allowed to operate only 2,000 public houses,
or pubs.
   Grand Met, which has 5,000 pubs, said in January that it was
looking at its brewing interests to see how it could conform to the
recommendation, but Monday's announcement was not believed to be
directly related to the report.

<TEXT>
   The head of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries said a new era of international cooperation is
developing between oil producers and consumers, a newspaper
reported Monday.
   Subroto said that recent meetings with officials in the European
Economic Community, Japan and the United States suggested
``complete agreement'' among the three nations and OPEC on various
oil-related issues.
   ``I found that they look toward OPEC differently now... and they
no longer consider it a danger against them,'' he said.
   Subroto's remarks to the Al-Watan daily followed last Thursday's
meeting with 20 members of a U.S. Congressional committee on
national energy security which the OPEC chief called ``a milestone
in the history of the oil industry.''
   He described the meetings as the first step toward a dialogue
between oil exporters and importers.
   ``For the first time in the history of the oil industry, an OPEC
representative met with American decision-makers,'' Secretary
General Subroto said.
   Subroto said he agreed with the EEC's energy commission on
setting up a joint committee to prepare for an OPEC meeting in
Brussels.
   He said Japan also approved a similar proposal and that a
Japanese team will visit OPEC headquarters in Vienna shortly for
talks.
   Subroto ruled out a change in the cartel's current oil
production ceiling of 22 million barrels a day when OPEC's market
monitoring committee meets March 16.
   ``I don't think there will be market developments which require
such a step,'' he said, referring to the relative stability
prevailing in the world oil market.

<HEAD>Iraq Expands Suba Field, Invites Foreign Participation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq's Oil Ministry announced it has
begun production at its southern Suba oilfield with an initial
output of 20,000 barrels a day, the official Iraqi News Agency said
Monday.
   Developing the Suba oilfield is part of a major expansion
program launched last year to develop Iraq's oil and gas reserves
following the August 1988 cease fire in the eight-year war with
Iran.
   Meanwhile, the Middle East Economic Survey weekly oil journal
said in its latest edition Monday that Iraq is inviting wider
foreign participation in oilfield development, a major policy
reversal.
   INA, monitored in Nicosia, reported that production at Suba, 60
miles west of the port of Basra, can be boosted to 60,000 barrels
of oil a day and that the field can also produce 20 million cubic
feet of gas daily.
   Iraq's oil ministry took steps in November to develop the Saddam
oilfield in Saladin province north of Baghdad to produce about 45
million cubic feet of gas a day. Oil output is 45,000 barrels a day.
   The ministry also announced last year that it had completed a
project to expand the Al-Zubair field south of Basra to increase
its production by 150,000 barrels of oil a day to 230,000 barrels
daily.
   INA said the Al-Zubair expansion was carried out by the state
Oil Projects Co. with Iraqi and foreign contractors, while the
drilling and preparation of wells was carried out by the Southern
Oil Co.
   Iraq's current oil production capacity is 4.5 million barrels a
day. But it is observing an Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries quota of 3.4 million barrels a day.
   The Iraqis, however, are driving to boost production capacity to
5 million barrels a day. Oil exports are Iraq's economic mainstay
and are vital to its post-war reconstruction program.
   Iraqi Oil Minister Isam al-Chalabi told the newsletter that
widening foreign participation in oil development marks a new
policy under which the foreign companies ``will be paid back in
crude oil from the same field after the start of production.''
   MEES said this amounted to ``a significant decision to broaden
the participation of foreign companies in the development of
oilfields in Iraq.''
   It added that the new policy ``is evidently designed to speed up
the expansion of Iraq's production capacity with infusions of new
investment and technology, given the financial constraints that
Iraq is experiencing'' in the aftermath of the Gulf war.
   Iraq and other Arab oil producers have over the last two decades
sought to ease foreign companies out.
   But the slump in oil prices has limited their investment
potential and they have recently been seeking new relations with
foreign companies.

   Nelson Mandela's release from
prison might help ease sanctions, economists and financial experts
said today, but they voiced concern about his endorsement of
violence and nationalization.
   Gold shares on the the Johannesburg Stock Exchange dropped 4
percent today, and the financial rand _ a special currency used by
foreign investors _ dropped 10 percent in value. Analysts quoted by
newspapers attributed the slump to nervousness over Mandela's
remarks.
   The initial reaction of the business community to Mandela's
release on Sunday was enthusiastic, with executives and leaders of
employer associations saying it would speed political reform and
persuade some Western countries to resume investment.
   Gavin Relly, chairman of the Anglo American Corp. mining
conglomerate, called the release ``a major step toward normalizing
South Africa's political life.''
   But the mood changed after Mandela, in a hard-line speech in
Cape Town on Sunday, reaffirmed his support for the African
National Congress' guerrilla campaign against the government and
for its goal of nationalizing mines and banks.
   ``The nationalization of mines is a fundamental policy of the
ANC,'' Mandela said. ``I believe the ANC is quite correct in this
attitude.''
   These pronouncements were causing ``jitters and uncertainty,
particularly among foreign investors,'' said an economist at a
major bank, who requested anonymity.
   Mandela's stance will ``definitely have a negative effect on
foreign perceptions of investment in South Africa, on local
business confidence and on private fixed investment,'' the
economist said.
   The Johannesburg Stock Exchange was ``decidely bearish'' after
Mandela's remarks, said a senior dealer at a brokerage firm. Share
prices fell slightly today after a strong rise last week.
   Business leaders remained hopeful that President F.W. de Klerk's
reforms and concessions would persaude Western countries to abandon
or ease the sanctions imposed in recent years as a protest against
apartheid.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a longtime oppoenent
of sanctions, dropped academic and cultural embargoes when de Klerk
legalized the ANC earlier this month, and she now wants to end a
ban on new investment.
   Britain intends to press the sanctions issue at a Feb. 20
meeting of European Economic Community foreign ministers in Dublin,
Ireland.
   The main EEC sanctions, which need community agreement to end,
are bans on imports of steel, iron and Krugerrand gold coins.
   President Bush has said his government will review existing
sanctions against South Africa, but a final decision will require
congressional approval.
   One major foreign company in South Africa, Shell Oil, was quick
to identify with black jubilation over Mandela's release. It took
out a two-page ad in The Sowetan, a major black newspaper, saying:
``Welcome back Nelson Mandela. The stars will shine brighter
tonight. Tomorrow, a brilliant future beckons.''

Department of Energy reported Monday.
   The U.S. coal industry produced 17.2 million tons in the same
week last year, according to the department's Energy Information
Administration.
   Wyoming ranked first among the 27 coal-producing states with
3.54 million tons produced. Kentucky was second at 3.44 million
tons and West Virginia was third at 2.97 million tons, the agency
said.
   Domestic coal production so far this year totaled 99 million
tons, 6.6 percent ahead of last year's production at this time.
   The week's figures are comprised of bituminous and lignite coal.

   The stock market showed a broad loss today,
backing off after last week's advance.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 45.50 points last
week, dropped 19.60 to 2,628.60 by noontime on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 5 to 2 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 384 up, 971
down and 464 unchange was curtailed, as expected, by a national holidd.
   Activityay in
Japan and the absence of some U.S. investors observing the
Lincoln's Birthday holiday.
   Analysts said traders had been encouraged by the results of the
Treasury's auction of notes and bonds last week, which generally
went off better than had been expected. That provided some relief
from recent worries over rising interest rates.
   But many market participants remained edgy over the outlook for
rates in other leading industrialized countries.
   For several weeks now Wall Streeters have been worrying that
rising rates overseas would push U.S. rates higher as well,
increasing the chances of a recession.

<TEXT>
   To get a rough idea of Eastern Europe's
rotting infrastructure, try riding the creaky Bulgarian railroads
or walking a snowy Sofia avenue in the dead of winter.
   As most Eastern Europeans know, but many potential Western
investors have yet to find out, getting from here to there often is
a matter of dumb luck.
   In the last 18 months, at least 30 people have died and more
than 150 have been injured in five accidents on Bulgaria's
state-run rail network. The reasons range from poorly maintained
axles to reckless crews.
   It's not much safer on the streets. This and every other winter,
countless dozens have slipped and broken bones because of the ice.
The Bulgarians don't know or care about salting, sanding or
plowing. Their idea of snow removal is a brigade of stalwart,
lackadaisical women armed with picks and brooms.
   Underlying these explanations is a chronic lack of investment in
equipment and an indifferent attitude among workers subjected to 40
years of mismanagement.
   All over Eastern Europe, antiquated cars, primitive hospitals,
outdated factories, horse-drawn carts, poorly lit homes, narrow
roads, rickety airplanes and lumbering trains testify to a neglect
of the basics that Westerners take for granted.
   The lack of efficient ways to travel, transport goods or even
make a telephone call are frustrating efforts by the Eastern
Europeans to transform their economies.
   Where citizens can help themselves, they do. In 1989, for
example, Hungarians used their own precious hard currency to import
60,000 Western cars.
   But most infrastructure problems are too big for the individual,
even for the state.
   No one knows how much money it would take to bring Eastern
Europe up to date in technology, communications, transportation and
education. Almost any data suggest the sum is enormous.
   The West German consulting firm Axel Boje, quoted in a recent
issue of Austria's business magazine Gewinn, estimated that more
than 85 percent of industrial enterprises in East Germany are 25
years out of date.
   The firm estimated $269.5 billion is needed to modernize East
Germany's factories and another $35.9 billion for maintenance.
   Axel Boje said add another $77.8 billion for telecommunications
and transportation, another small fortune to build 400,000 homes,
and the bill for at least 20,000 managers to be trained in the
West, and East Germany might rival its Western cousin.
   Not even booming West Germany has that kind of money. For
countries like Bulgaria, with no wealthy friends, it is even harder
to modernize its rusting machines or add to the 2.29 million
telephones serving 8.9 million citizens.
   New democracy could prove as useless as old Stalinism in
creating economic might.
   ``The main reason for the neglect of infrastructure is
systemic,'' said Peter Havlik, a Czech-born expert at Vienna's
Institute for International Economic Comparisons. ``Traditional
Marxist theory had it that this was the so-called non-productive
area, and so very little was invested.''
   But, Havlik said, expansion ``needs enormous reserves. These do
not exist in Eastern countries. Thus we must fear that, given the
priorities these countries must make with reforms, infrastructure
again gets left behind. They must invest in industry, they must
deal with huge environmental damage, and there won't be enough left
over.''
   Some steps have been made. Last year, for instance, the ailing
telephone network in Budapest was enlarged in one weekend.
   Before that, Hungary's pioneering entrepreneurs had found
attempts just to establish offices with Western firms floundering
for lack of telephone numbers.
   Knowledge of the modern working world is also a problem. Most
East Europeans receive at least 11 years of schooling, and many
learn foreign languages, with the elite of the future attending
special schools that teach them near-perfect English, French,
German, Spanish or Italian.
   But, while the lack of Western distractions and a tradition of
valuing education may make them fine students, it doesn't equip
them with independent thinking.
   Decades of isolation from the outside world compound the
problem, giving most East Europeans a picture of the West akin to
Paradise on Earth _ with no imagination of the work needed to
afford the luxury.
   ``Total security in the future'' _ a promise held out by
Stalinism _ ``kills all incentives for dedicated work,'' said Ivan
Angelov, a Communist reform economist in Bulgaria, after some
restructuring began in 1987.
   Three years later, morale remains poor. ``A basic problem is low
efficiency, which is pervasive,'' Angelov's Soviet colleague,
Stanislav Shatalin, stated recently.
   Even in Czechoslovakia, where citizens are closer to the West
both geographically and mentally, unsuitable education impedes
development.
   Before revolution promoted him to the post of adviser to Vaclav
Klaus, the new finance minister, economist Dusan Triska pondered
how to calculate the country's real inflation rate.
   ``For years, it hasn't been properly studied,'' he said. ``We
must say, we know very little about ourselves.''
   The lack of such basic data hinders any Western company that
decides to do business with Eastern Europe. Intricate paperwork
adds to the frustration for such simple tasks as bank transactions
or purchases of state supplies.
   Scarce resources and bureaucratic bumbling present obstacles to
business and political initiatives alike.
   ``Everyone keeps comparing our democratization to that of Spain
after Franco,'' said Rudolf Joo of the opposition Hungarian
Democratic Forum last summer. ``But it's not the same. In Spain, if
you have money and support, you just go and rent office space and
order telephones.''

   Before the Berlin Wall opened in a
symbolic breaching of the East-West business barrier, Salamander AG
had produced more than 50 million pairs of shoes for
fashion-starved East Germans and Soviets.
   Volkswagen, maker of some of Europe's best-selling cars, has for
nearly 20 years been fitting Golf and Polo sedans with headlights,
horns and engines made under contract in East Germany.
   From the Bertelsmann publishers supplying book clubs in Dresden
to the Asko department store managers in Bulgaria, Hungary and the
Soviet Union, West German merchants who nursed weak business
prospects through the frosty decades of East-West discord are best
positioned now to exploit opportunities in Eastern Europe.
   ``While many other European and other countries are trying to
get their foot in the door in Eastern Europe, we're already inside,
sitting on the sofa and having tea,'' Jochen Degkwitz, Deutsche
Bank assistant vice president for East European affairs, said in
describing his nation's commanding lead.
   West Germany's boldness primarily has benefited cousin East
Germany, and they seem to be moving toward economic reunification
with stunning speed.
   The West German mark, for example, could soon become the single
national currency, a monetary union that would give Bonn enormous
influence in rebuilding and reshaping the sickly East German
economy.
   West Germany already has the strongest economy in Europe, a
strategic location as the pivotal point between East and West, and
a long history as Eastern Europe's largest Western trading partner.
   When finally calculated, West German trade with the East bloc
for 1989 is expected to exceed the $31.7 billion level recorded the
previous year. It accounted for more than half of all business
volume between Western Europe and the East bloc, but only about 5
percent of West Germany's worldwide total.
   It's difficult to estimate the potential for new business and
industry in a region long locked in the vacuum of socialist
economics. But Eastern Europeans are starving for products ranging
from cars to can openers. Economists say this demand could
eventually translate into enormous profits for investors with the
money and patience to endure a transition that could last a decade.
   Heinrich Vogel, an economist who heads Cologne's Institute for
Eastern and International Studies, contends the consumer needs of
more than 400 million people in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union
present international business with its best opportunity.
   ``The potential, in terms of an educated work force with
unsatisfied consumer demands and a broad technology gap, is
tremendous. Everyone is looking for new markets, and where else in
the world do you have a better chance to make money?'' Vogel said.
   Western Europe, which has more than 10 times the volume of trade
with Eastern Europe than either Japan or the United States, could
retain its edge because of proximity and shared history and culture.
   Most of the hundreds of cooperative ventures bringing Western
goods to Eastern buyers are between European partners.
   Philips of the Netherlands, for example, makes videocassette
recorders with Tesla of Czechoslovakia, while Sweden's Volvo sells
vans to East Germany. Austria's Wienerwald restaurant chain has
branched into Hungary, and a handful of Western automakers recently
have announced new projects, including a Volkswagen plant in
Karl-Marx-Stadt and a Renault venture in Czechoslovakia.
   Replacing costly imports with home-produced goods is the primary
aim of East Europeans, said Gerd Adomeit, East European trade
specialist with West Germany's Industry and Trade Council.
   ``We will contribute to their reconstruction mainly by
cooperation in joint ventures and by providing technology,
management skills and marketing skills to sell products in the
West,'' Adomeit said. ``However, import substitution is more
important to East Europeans now.''
   Many West German businesses, sensing what was needed long ago,
have been engrossed in efforts to help modernize Eastern Europe's
crumbling infrastructure. Some are expected to do quite well in
projects ranging from communications to power generation.
   Stock prices have shot up for firms like Siemens electronics, a
likely candidate to revamp the East bloc's woeful telephone
network. Upgrading of industrial plants will draw on the technical
know-how of Thyssen, Hoesch and Preussag, and Daimler-Benz's
transport expertise is in demand for the region's daunting rail
electrification needs.
   Most pressing and therefore most promising is the field of
environmental cleanup, as Poland, East Germany and Czechoslovakia
vie for the dishonor of the continent's most polluted state.
   West Germany has pledged more than $1 billion to 17 East German
cleanup projects. Asea Brown Boveri of Switzerland will be
producing steam turbines and other power plant equipment with
Poland's Zamech firm in one of the first projects aimed at
environmental improvement.
   Much of the West European interest in entering cooperative
projects with the East is stifled by indecision and inconsistency
in the laws regulating foreign investment.
   Some countries have yet to adopt clearly defined rules for joint
ventures and repatriation of profits by foreign companies, for
example. Even investments in tourism, considered an easy and quick
way to lure foreigners and their money, are hampered by poor
transportation and unmotivated workers.
   ``People who think they can come in and make a quick buck are
going to be very disappointed,'' said Eddy Buehlmann, senior vice
president for American Express Travel Related Services for Europe,
Africa and the Middle East.
   ``Service with a smile, or service with sentiment, as we say at
American Express, doesn't exist in Eastern Europe,'' Buehlmann said.

<HEAD>Japan Lukewarm to Expanding Business in Eastern Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GROSS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu toured Europe
last month he demonstrated Japan's economic might by announcing
almost $2 billion in aid to Poland and Hungary, dwarfing what the
United States has committed.
   In contrast, private Japanese industries, known for their
aggressive expansion elsewhere, are reluctant to plunge into a part
of the world they see as inexperienced, ill-equipped and still
emerging from 40 years of communism.
   A few prominent deals have been done. Suzuki Motor Co., for
example, recently agreed to establish an automobile plant in
Hungary, the first Japanese company to enter a joint venture with
Eastern Europe since the tumultuous political changes there.
   But Eastern Europe remains virtually untouched by Japanese
business. In 1988, Japan trade with the region totaled about $1.47
billion, excluding the Soviet Union. That's less than 1 percent of
Japanese trade worldwide.
   Though many Japanese firms have offices in Eastern European
nations, only about a dozen joint ventures have been established.
No Japanese company has yet invested in Poland, East Germany or
Czechoslovakia.
   Japanese businessmen have a range of reasons for holding back.
High inflation rates, a heavy debt burden and inconvertible
currencies make it difficult to profit in Eastern Europe, in their
view.
   Restrictions on exports of high technology to the East bloc, a
vestige of the Cold War that remains entrenched, also have reduced
the spectrum of trade opportunities for the Japanese, leading
exporters of high-tech items.
   Nonetheless, the changing political and economic landscape of
Eastern Europe has evoked Japan's interest. The government has
allocated $750 million for export insurance to encourage Japanese
firms to trade there.
   To Daihatsu Motor Co., economic reform and Japanese government
aid cannot alleviate the tremendous risks it sees.
   One of Japan's smallest automobile manufacturers, Daihatsu has
tried for more than five years to set up an assembly plant in
Poland. Though it developed an ambitious plan to build a
12,000-vehicle-a-year plant with Polish automaker FSO, Daihatsu
failed to acquire enough financing and the plan collapsed.
   Last fall, FSO approached Daihatsu again. This time, said
spokesman Wataru Shindo, the company has considerably scaled down
plans _ it will export about 6,000 unassembled Charade models to
Poland.
   ``We don't know whether we'll be able to meet our costs. At a
scale of 5,000 to 6,000 cars, even if we fail there will be little
damage done,'' Shindo said.
   Japan's largest glass manufacturer expressed the same caution.
Asahi Glass Co. has been negotiating with Poland to establish a
plate glass factory in the southern city of Sandomierz.
   The risks remain high, said Asahi official Shigehiko Tomita, and
no commitment has been made.
   Tomita said trade insurance and other Japanese government
support was necessary but stability in Eastern Europe was more
important.
   ``The political and economic situation in Poland is still fluid,
and the risks great. The country has high inflation, and even
though we think that democratization will proceed, we need to have
some protection,'' he said.
   Shigeki Ura, a senior officer with merchant trader C. Itoh and
Co. in Eastern Europe, doubted Japanese firms will attempt any
large-scale investments.
   Nevertheless, he added, ``As businessmen specializing in the
Eastern European market, we should not be so optimistic, but not so
pessimistic. Economic reform and democracy will give us chances.''
   Ura said Japanese firms differ fundamentally from European firms
in their attitude toward developing the Eastern European market.
The Japanese want clear-cut laws in place specifying what is
permissible for foreigners, but some European investors are willing
to overlook legal vaguenesses, Ura said.
   Despite Japan's reluctance, its neighbor South Korea seems eager
to exploit opportunity in Eastern Europe. Yoo Chang-soon, chairman
of the Federation of Korean Industries, South Korea's largest
business organization, said recently that ``prospects are bright''
for direct investment there.
   ``Some big entrepreneurs have already studied plans for direct
investment in communist countries,'' he said.
   South Korea established diplomatic relations with Hungary,
Poland and Yugoslavia only last year, and has a $91 million dollar
trade surplus with those countries.

   For 40 years, Eastern Europe has produced goods only the Soviet
Union would buy. They got back oil, raw materials and finished
products. Artificial rates were fixed in ``transferable rubles.''
   This closed circuit within strictly patrolled borders reduced
former industrial powers to Third World levels, with 40 percent of
the European Economic Community's productivity rate at twice the
energy consumption.
   Reform-minded countries must now wean themselves from the Soviet
Union and its socialist trading bloc, Comecon.
   The Soviet Union and Comecon partners agreed in January to work
toward trade in hard, convertible currency. But there was sharp
disagreement on how.
   ``I don't think these countries know what they're in for,'' said
Jan Vanous, a specialist on Eastern Europe at PlanEcon Inc., a
Washington consulting firm. ``They'll see inflation, unemployment,
debt, the works.''
   Because East bloc currencies are useless in the West, no one
knows precisely what they're worth. Many economists say these
currencies will have to find their true value in a free market of
foreign exchange, but most agree they are worth a fraction of their
officially set rates.
   This means, for example, that it could take huge sums of Polish
zlotys, Czech korunas, or Hungarian forints to buy the same things
that smaller amounts of those currencies bought previously.
   ``They will have to break out of the old cycle of `you pretend
to work and we pretend to pay you,''' Vanous said. ``It will be
very difficult.''
   Some Eastern European leaders who espouse free enterprise and
open markets still recoil from the term capitalism.
   Romania's revolutionary government, for example, cannot remove
the social safety net as it picks up the pieces of a potentially
rich agricultural economy plundered by executed dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu.
   When the revolution began, Petre Roman said Romania would open
its economy to the world. Later as prime minister he remarked, ``It
would be irresponsible to speak of this in detail now.''
   Czechoslovakia is slowly opening without abandoning socialist
safeguards, guided by economists who pushed for reform under the
communists. Not only are top managers reluctant to relinquish power
but many workers fear the adventure of free competition.
   ``We will have a tremendous job breaking up the mafia that runs
the big state companies,'' said one government adviser, who spoke
on the condition of anonymity. ``I am not sure we can do it.''
   East Germany is trying to intertwine with West Germany while
keeping its socialist character. But as people move west, from cab
drivers to physicists, plans are in turmoil. Pressure from Bonn is
accelerating economic integration.
   Hungarians have experimented with a private sector since the
early 1980s and have long been open to outside influence. Today
Budapest looks like a prosperous Western capital. Vaci Street,
nearly as swank as Paris' rue de la Paix, glitters with wealth. Its
McDonald's is Europe's busiest.
   General Motors Corp. recently committed $150 million to a joint
venture, one of 400 deals struck in the last six months between
Hungarian and foreign companies. Hungarian officials toured U.S.
stock exchanges last month in preparation for plans to expand their
own, launched a year ago.
   In a desperate image-building move, Hungary decided to co-host
the 1995 World's Fair with Austria, which will cost its strapped
economy an estimated $2.5 billion.
   Laszlo Lengyel, an influential economic consultant in Budapest,
said little has changed for Hungary's or Eastern Europe's three
main classes despite giant political strides.
   In Hungary, wages average $150 a month. Waiting lists for tiny
subsidized apartments approach 20 years. Private homes are
prohibitively expensive.
   While the elites retain power, Lengyel said, a broad class of
workers sees no prospect for new income beyond controlled wages.
Worse, many fear layoffs in a new free-for-all atmosphere.
   A third class of people with second jobs or small businesses on
the side might take new risks, he said. But few have contacts,
access to capital or reliable suppliers.
   Lengyel said a breakthrough may come from European and Japanese
investors who join local entrepreneurs in businesses that control
their own supply and distribution.
   But, he said, the American approach offering minimal official
aid and encouraging joint ventures will have limited impact. Even
some American diplomats in the region say privately that a country
which spent trillions to combat communism militarily should risk a
few billion to defeat it peacefully.
   The Gdansk Shipyard, birthplace of the Solidarity movement that
incited the East bloc's sweeping changes, embodies the challenge.
   Operations director Hans Szyc explained he could sell all the
ships he could make, but not without capital. Foreign investors
remain cautious and local banks charge 58 percent interest per
month.
   ``True, I am proud of the role this shipyard played in changing
the whole world,'' Szyc said. ``But the problem is not the past,
not today, but the future.''

<HEAD>Number of Models For Eastern Europeans to Emulate in
Transformation</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-EUR--Economic Challenge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern European nations face a range of alternatives in the
search for prototypes to reform their stagnating economies. All
involve dismantling state-run subsidy systems that keep prices
artificially low, unleashing market forces of supply and demand,
and moving toward integration with the rest of the world. The
unprecedented undertaking is fraught with risks. Moreover, none of
the models advanced so far has been put to an extended test.
   Below are some of the approaches under discussion:
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   State-owned companies would be converted to worker-owned
businesses through the issuance of stock to employees. Under this
arrangement, the government would give preferential low-interest
loans to these businesses, repayable over long periods, while
workers would control production, expansion, research, marketing,
hiring and firing. Employee ownership would preserve the socialist
ideal of workers controlling their own destinies. But in the West,
where variations of this model also have been tried, they often
have resulted in inefficiency and a reluctance by employees to make
tough decisions needed for their businesses to compete and survive.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>MANAGEMENT OWNERSHIP</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   State-owned companies would be sold to existing management,
foreign companies or a combination of both. In essentially one bold
stroke, the government would end its role as a giant business
monopoly, theoretically encouraging competition and productivity.
Sales of state-owned assets would be financed by low-interest
government loans. If the buyers are overseas investors, the
government would benefit by an infusion of foreign currency and
expertise. The risks lie in entrenching old managers, mostly
unqualified Communist Party functionaries. The process could create
enormous resentment by workers who feel little has changed.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>INTERLOCKING OWNERSHIP</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   State-owned companies would be restructured into interlocking
networks of suppliers and lenders that own stakes in each other,
creating an incentive for them to cooperate. An automaker, for
example, would form a partnership with a steel factory, which would
be partly owned by a bank, which in turn would be partly owned by
the automaker. Workers would assume a role in helping direct these
networks and would be protected by labor unions. Variations of this
model helped revive the shattered economies of postwar Japan and
West Germany. But in Eastern Europe's case, they raise the
possibility of entrenching unqualified managers, similar to the
risk presented by the management ownership model.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>CITIZEN OWNERSHIP</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   State-owned companies would be turned over to the population at
large, either in the form of stock given to all or via an auction
in which groups of citizens would compete to buy them. This
strategy in many respects is the fairest, by giving people an equal
economic opportunity. But it also presents the threat of
instability and confusion. If companies are simply restructured
into stock portfolios for each citizen, no new capital is created
for the economy to grow.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>ENTREPRENEUR OWNERSHIP</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The government would encourage the creation of small-scale
private businesses by managers and employees of existing
state-owned firms. This strategy would preserve the state's
dominant economic role indefinitely but would create new sources of
employment and production. The risk lies in the advantages that
some state enterprises have in access to supplies, creating the
possibility of profiteering and a polarization of classes into rich
and poor. Variations of this strategy have been tried on a limited
basis in China, but often have led to official corruption and a
popular backlash against entrepreneurs who become relatively
wealthy.

<TEXT>
   Top American and Soviet trade officials today
launched wide-ranging negotiations aimed at normalizing trade
between the two superpowers for the first time in nearly a
half-century.
   Asked if the talks could be accomplished in time for President
Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to sign a new trade
treaty at their summit in June, U.S. Trade Representative Carla
Hills said, ``We are a very efficient team.''
   She and Deputy Trade Representative Julius Katz led the American
negotiating team, while the Soviet delegation was headed by Yuriy
N. Chumakov, deputy minister of foreign economic relations.
   The agenda for just the first day of consultations listed 15
areas of discussions. The complexity of the negotiations was
demonstrated by the fact that the U.S. delegation included 19
officials from six separate government agencies.
   Officials said the first round of discussions were scheduled to
last through Tuesday, with more talks expected at the end of
February, possibly in Moscow.
   U.S. officials are hoping to wrap up the negotiations in April,
giving plenty of time for drafting the final document that will be
signed by Bush and Gorbachev at the Washington summit in June.
   Bush has said he hopes that normalizing trade relations between
the two nations will boost the Soviet economy and lend support to
the political reforms being undertaken by Gorbachev.
   Then-President Truman imposed trade restrictions on the Soviet
Union in 1947 after relations between the World War II allies
deteriorated.
   Under a U.S.-Soviet trade agreement, U.S. consumers would see
lower prices for such popular items as Soviet vodka, which by one
estimate could drop in price by $1.25 a bottle, and for luxury
items such as Russian furs.
   As part of a trade agreement, the United States would grant the
Soviet Union ``most favored nation'' status, qualifying it for the
lowest tariffs granted to other countries.
   Currently, the Soviets are blocked from that status because of
the 1974 Jackson-Vanik amendment, which penalized the Soviets for
their ban against emigration by Soviet Jews and other dissidents.
   The Soviets have liberalized that policy since Gorbachev came to
power, and Bush has said he will propose to Congress a waiver of
the Jackson-Vanik tariffs once the Soviet parliament passes
legislation that would put the liberalized policies into law.
   The lower tariffs cannot take effect, however, until there is a
trade treaty between the two countries.
   One primary area of dispute in the trade talks is expected to be
how the Jackson-Vanik tariffs will be lifted. The Bush
administration would like a three-year trade agreement with annual
presidential review and waiver of the high tariffs.
   The Soviets, however, would like to see the tariffs removed
permanently to build confidence among business leaders that trade
relations will remain stable in coming years.
   But such a position is not likely to find political favor in
Congress. Micah Naftalin, national director of the Union of
Councils for Soviet Jews, said his organization supports the more
limited one-year waivers.
   ``We should be giving them what they have earned, but we
shouldn't go overboard,'' he said. ``The country is still
extraordinarily unstable and we should take it step by step.''
   The administration seeks to guarantee the protection of
American-patented products from piracy, an arbitration method to
settle business disputes and provisions allowing either country to
impose temporary trade restrictions if a domestic industry suffers
injury because of an unexpected surge of imports.
   Under a trade agreement between the two nations, the
administration predicts that two-way trade, which last year totaled
under $5 billion, could double or even triple within the next two
or three years.
   But many experts said the administration was being
over-optimistic in its projections of increased trade, given the
troubles plaguing the Soviet economy.
   ``The reforms that have captured world attention so far have all
been on the political and social level,'' said Richard Kaufman, an
expert on Soviet affairs with the Joint Economic Committee of
Congress. ``I am not all that optimistic about significant
increases in trade flows until the Soviet economy is reformed.''
   Robert Cullen, editor of Soviet-American Trade, a newsletter on
the subject, said that even with a trade agreement, ``the
fundamental barriers between the Soviet Union and America, such as
not having a convertible ruble, are not going to be alleviated.''
   American farm groups are watching the trade negotiations with
keen interest. Three-fourths of U.S. export sales to the Soviet
Union involve American farm products and the Soviets reportedly
have stated that they will not approve a new grain sales agreement
with the United States until they are granted lower tariffs.

<HEAD>Hasbro Earnings Up 14 Percent in Quarter, 27 Percent for 1989</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PAWTUCKET, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hasbro Inc. on Monday reported profit
gains of 14 percent for the fourth quarter and 27 percent for the
full year.
   The company also said it discontinued its Maxie line of fashion
dolls, Hasbro's primary competition against Mattel Inc.'s Barbie,
because the doll did not meet sales expectations.
   The toy manufacturer earned $24 million, or 40 cents a share, in
the fourth quarter, up from $21 million, or 36 cents a share a year
earlier. Sales rose 5.6 percent to $417 million from $395 million.
   Income for the year ended Dec. 25 totaled $92.2 million, or
$1.56 a share, compared with $72.4 million, or $1.24 a share, in
1988. Revenue for 1989 was up about 4 percent at $1.4 billion from
1988's $1.35 billion.
   A Hasbro executive said the the toymaker's annual results were
not as good if a 1988 video game write-off were considered.
   ``But it's not as dramatic as it seems'' when tempered by 1988's
charge for the Nemo video system that never came to market, said
John T. O'Neill, executive vice president and chief financial
officer.
   Deducting that from 1988 research and development costs would
have improved earnings to about $80 million, in the range of $1.40
a share, he said.
   Hasbro, however, maintained its margins by holding costs down _
advertising increases, for instance, rose less than 1 percent.
   ``We managed very tightly in terms of operating costs and ... we
succeeded in getting a lot more leverage on our fixed costs,''
O'Neill said.
   Alan G. Hassenfeld. chairman and chief executive, said there was
balanced growth domestically and overseas, despite the strong
dollar.
   Domestic growth came from the Milton Bradley and Playskool
lines, Hassenfeld said. He said the addition of Cabbage Patch Kids
from Coleco brought more balance to Hasbro's product lines.
   Spokesman Wayne Charness confirmed that Hasbro had discontinued
Maxie. He said the decision was made about a month ago and that
Hasbro was keying on its recently announced New Kids on the Block
line as its latest fashion doll entry.
   ``Maxie was doing OK, but it really wasn't living up to the
expectations we had for it,'' Charness said.
   He refused to provide figures. The Wall Street Journal said an
analyst estimated Maxie sales last year were $20 million to $25
million, about the same as a year earlier, while Barbie sales were
approximately $375 million.

<TEXT>
   Jurors unanimously agreed Monday that Monsanto
Co. was not liable for alleged damages to residents whose homes
were built near a toxic waste dump.
   The 222 homeowners were asking for $335 million from the
chemical company, the chief user of the dump.
   Past and present residents of the subdivision in southeast
Houston sued Monsanto after learning much of the toxic waste in the
dump came from the chemical company.
   The plaintiffs claimed the Brio waste site has been the cause of
medical problems ranging from upset stomachs to headaches. Some
residents testified they fear they will contract cancer because
they live so close to the dump.
   In addition, plaintiffs claimed their property values have
dropped significantly.
   Monsanto denies responsibility for any injuries, saying it is
one of many companies that have used the Brio site through the
years. Monsanto has sued the developers and builders who
constructed homes in the area, saying they should be responsible
for any damages awarded by the jury.
   During closing arguments, Monsanto attorneys charged the suit is
a ``conspiracy'' against the company on the part of builders and
developers of the subdivision, who settled a lawsuit filed by the
homeowners, then joined forces with them against Monsanto.
   The trial began in state District Judge Alice Trevathan's court
in October. The Harris County jurors began deliberations Feb. 6.

   Share prices plunged Monday on London's Stock
Exchange as news circulated that the large Wall Street investment
house Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. was looking for a major investor
or a merger partner.
   Drexel said that unsettled markets, particularly the junk bond
market, have adversely affected the liquidity of its parent
company, Drexel Burnham Lambert Group.
   Wall Street has been abuzz for months with rumors that the firm
needed financial support to keep afloat amid lagging markets.
   ``We're very concerned about the Drexel statement,'' said one
head of market making at a London firm. ``We're waiting for a

<HEAD>First Trial Begins in Guinness Scandal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first trial began Monday in the ``Guinness
Affair'' stock manipulation case, the unprecedented white-collar
scandal that rocked British business after the multibillion-dollar
takeover of Distillers Co. by brewing giant Guinness PLC.
   Eight men, including Guinness' former chairman Ernest Saunders,
have been accused of involvement in a scheme to purchase Guinness
shares during the 1986 takeover fight for Distillers, a Scotch
whisky and gin maker, in an attempt to boost Guinness' stock price.
   The defendants allegedly aimed to make Guinness' $4.3 billion
cash and stock bid more attractive than a rival offer from
supermarket operator Argyll Group PLC.
   Guinness succeeded in April 1986 in what was Britain's largest
takeover ever. But in December of that year, the Department of
Trade and Industry announced it was investigating the deal and the
alleged financial wrongdoing started coming to light.
   The defendants in the first trial, which is expected to last up
to six months, are Saunders, 54; Gerald Ronson, the 50-year-old
chairman of the diversified conglomerate Heron International PLC;
former stockbroker Anthony Parnes, 44; and millionaire financier
and arts patron Sir Jack Lyons, 74.
   They face a total of 35 charges on such counts as stock
manipulation, theft, false accounting and destruction of documents.
   The four men briefly exchanged words as they took their places
on swivel chairs behind moveable desks in Southwark Crown Court.
   A jury of seven men and five women is to hear the case. The
trial judge, Sir Denis Henry, adjourned the case until Tuesday to
give the jurors time to put their affairs in order.
   The judge ruled last September that because of its complexity,
the case should be split into two consecutive trials.
   In the second trial, not scheduled to begin before October,
Saunders will be joined by Roger Seelig, 44, former Morgan Grenfell
and Co. Ltd. corporate finance director; Lord Patrick Spens, 47,
former director of corporate finance at the merchant bank Henry
Ansbacher and Co. Ltd.; and David Mayhew, 48, who continues as
senior corporate finance partner of the investment firm Cazenove
and Co.
   The seven men have pleaded innocent to the charges and each is
free on $850,000 bail.
   The eighth man charged is Thomas Ward, an American attorney who
also has denied wrongdoing. British police are seeking Ward's
extradition from the United States.
   Saunders _ who maintains that he is a scapegoat _ appears as a
broken public figure, openly bitter about trial delays, the
extensive legal fees which have forced him to obtain legal aid, and
the scandal's devastating effect on his family. He spent a night in
jail when he was arrested in May 1987.
   In an unusual step, the judge decided the defendants in the
first trial would not be required to appear in court every day. He
told them to apply to him for permission to be absent on days when
there was no likelihood of evidence concerning them being called.

<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela's declaration
of support Monday for nationalization of gold mines and other key
assets sent shockwaves through South Africa's business world.
   Mandela's statement on his first full day of freedom sent gold
shares down 4 percent on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. The
financial rand, a special currency used to encourage foreign
investment, plummeted 10 percent.
   The reaction apparently did not extend overseas. Gold prices
rose in Europe and the United States.
   Mandela told a news conference he fully supports the economic
plan of his African National Congress for a state-run economy,
including nationalization of mines and other major pillars of the
economy.
   ``The nationalization of mines is a fundamental policy of the
ANC,'' Mandela said. ``I believe the ANC is quite correct in this
attitude.''
   Businesses also were unnerved by Mandela's statements that he
supports armed struggle to end white-minority rule and destroy the
apartheid system. Mandela also stressed his desire for peace and
said whites had nothing to fear from blacks under a true democratic
system.
   The remarks punctured optimism in the business community that
had been generated by President F.W. de Klerk's announcement Feb. 2
of reforms to pave the way for talks with blacks on peacefully
ending white minority rule. The stock market and other economic
indicators rose after de Klerk's speech.
   Mandela's pronouncements were causing ``jitters and
uncertainty,'' said an economist at a major bank, who requested
anonymity.
   The black leader's stance will ``definitely have a negative
effect on foreign perceptions of investment in South Africa, on
local business confidence and on private fixed investment,'' the
economist said.
   Whites control the economy and white business and political
leaders say any future power-sharing deal with blacks must rest on
a free enterprise system. The white business community fears
nationalization will cripple the economy.
   Business leaders still hope de Klerk's reforms and concessions
will convince Western countries to abandon or ease the sanctions
imposed on South Africa in recent years as a protest against
apartheid.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a longtime opponent of
sanctions, dropped academic and cultural embargoes when de Klerk
legalized the ANC earlier this month, and she now wants to end a
ban on new investment.
   U.S. President George Bush has said his government will review
existing sanctions against South Africa, but a final decision would
require congressional approval.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
higher Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade, bolstered by
perceptions of shrinking supplies and prospects for new grain sales
to the Soviet Union.
   In a monthly report released after the close of trading Friday,
the USDA projected the nation's corn stockpile at 1.48 billion
bushels by Aug. 31, the end of the 1989-90 marketing year. That
compares with the January estimate of 1.61 billion bushels and last
year's ending stocks of 1.93 billion.
   The USDA pegged U.S. wheat stocks at 443 million bushels by May
31, the end of the wheat marketing year, compared with a January
estimate of 468 million bushels and last year's ending stocks of
698 million.
   Both estimates were below trade expectations. The Aug. 31
soybean projection of 335 million bushels, unchanged from January,
was near expectations.
   Traders also were attuned to the opening Monday in Washington of
U.S.-Soviet trade talks, which could lead to the United States
granting the Soviet Union most-favored-nation trade status,
allowing freer trade between the superpowers.
   At the close, wheat futures were unchanged to 2 cents higher
with the contract for delivery in March at $3.88} a bushel; corn
futures were 2\ cents to 3{ cents higher with March at $2.41} a

<HEAD>Report: UAL Unions Eye Chief Executive Candidate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Airlines' labor unions, who are seeking
employee ownership of parent UAL Corp., have approached at least
one candidate to replace UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf, according to
a report published Monday.
   The Chicago Sun-Times reported that Richard Ravitch, former
chairman of Bowery Savings Bank of New York and onetime head of New
York's transit authority, said he had held ``very preliminary
discussions'' with union representatives.
   Ravitch also said he had the impression the union group was
talking with others about taking Wolf's job, according to the
newspaper$.
   Attempts by The Associated Press to contact Ravitch were not
immediately successful. A receptionist at his New York office said
Ravitch was out of town, but would not reveal his whereabouts.
   There has been no indication that Wolf would resign from
Chicago-based UAL, which he has headed since December 1987, as part
of any employee buyout deal between the unions and the company's
board of directors.
   But the union group, representing United's pilots, machinists
and flight attendants, is believed to be hoping to dump Wolf and
Chief Financial Officer Jack Pope and recruit a new management team
before approaching banks for loans to finance a buyout.
   Union and UAL board representatives have been negotiating the
terms of a formal buyout bid and are expected to report on their
progress at a Feb. 22 board meeting.
   Neither a UAL spokesman nor spokesmen for the three unions would
comment on the Sun-Times report.
   A source within the union group, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the management issue has not been decided. But, he
said, ``I think it's probably fair to say that everyone wouldn't
mind looking elsewhere.''
   Wolf's role in an employee-owned UAL was not covered in a buyout
proposal outlined by the unions last month, nor was the price of
the 75 percent stake that the workers want to buy.
   Some airline analysts believe dumping Wolf would be a mistake,
despite his history of fractious relations with the unions.
   They say Wolf's experience in turning around the financial
fortunes of the former Republic Airlines and Flying Tiger
air-freight carrier before coming to UAL make him a good leader for
United, which has fallen behind American Airlines in ridership in
recent years after long leading the industry.
   Analyst Louis Marckesano of Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in
Philadelphia said the subject of dumping Wolf came up at a recent
meeting of airline analysts, most of whom ``thought it would be big
dumb thing the unions may be trying to do.''
   UAL's stock lost $4 to close at $132.50 Monday in New York Stock
Exchange Trading.

   The dollar ended narrowly higher Monday against
most key currencies in quiet, uneventful trading.
   Gold prices rose here after a mixed performance overseas.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $419.20 a troy ounce, up $3.10 from late
Friday. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for
gold at $418.70 an ounce, up $2.95.
   Currency dealers said the dollar continued to gain ground at the
expense of the West German mark. The market remains concerned that
a proposal to reunify the monetary systems of the two German states
could hurt West Germany's economy.
   However, the markets were slowed by the closure of Tokyo trading
houses for a public holiday, dealers said.
   In London, the dollar fetched 144.20 yen, compared with 144.72
Friday. Later, in New York, the dollar stood at 144.37 yen, down
from 144.725 yen Friday.
   The dollar was mixed against the British pound. Sterling bought
$1.6960, up from $1.6930 late Friday, and $1.6918 in New York, down
from $1.6955.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday
quotes, included: 1.6755 West German marks, up from 1.6680; 1.5005
Swiss francs, up from 1.4915; 5.6965 French francs, up from 5.6720;
1,246.00 Italian lire, up from 1,241.25; and 1.20065 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.20025.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Friday: 1.6695 West
German marks, down from 1.6750; 1.4960 Swiss francs, up from
1.4935; 5.6785 French francs, up from 5.6765; 1.8890 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.8835; 1,242.00 Italian lire, down from
1,242.25; and 1.2023 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1987.
   Gold rose in London to $419.50 an ounce from $415.75 late
Friday. In Zurich, gold rose to $419 an ounce from $416 Friday.
   But earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 92 cents to close at
$414.41 an ounce.
   Silver prices gained. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery closed at $5.286 a troy ounce, up 3.2 cents from
Friday. Silver rose in London to $5.32 an ounce from $5.25.

<HEAD>Time Warner Announces $317 Million Loss Due to Warner Acquisition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Time Warner Inc. announced Monday it lost $317
million in the fourth quarter and $987 million for all of 1989
because of costs related to its $14 billion acquisition of Warner
Communications Inc.
   Despite the loss, which was expected, securities analysts said
they were satisfied with the results because Time Warner's cash
flow _ which is crucial for paying off its $10.6 billion in debt _
was strong.
   Time Warner, formerly Time Inc., completed its acquisition of
Warner Communications on Jan. 10 after having acquired more than
half of Warner's shares in a tender offer last July.
   The results announced Monday were reported as though Time had
acquired Warner on Jan. 1, 1988, and therefore included results
from all of Warner's divisions.
   Time Warner's fourth-quarter loss amounted to $5.52 per share
and compared with a loss of $320 million, or $5.61 a share, in the
same period of 1988.
   However, Time Warner's operating income, which does not reflect
interest, taxes, costs associated with the Warner acquisition and
other expenses, totaled $412 million, up from $351 million a year
earlier.
   The company's fourth-quarter combined revenue rose to $3.09
billion from $2.5 billion a year earlier.
   Time Warner said its quarterly results reflected a $175 million
loss before taxes on the sale of its Scott, Foresman and Co. book
publisher.
   They also included a $63 million gain before taxes on the sale
of Time Warner's stock in Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.
   The company said all its divisions performed well during the
quarter.
   Time-Warner's magazine division, which includes Time, Sports
Illustrated and People magazines, had operating income of $108
million in the fourth quarter, up 13 percent from 1988. Advertising
revenue was up 8.7 percent while circulation revenue increased 4.7
percent.
   Time Warner said its magazine revenue more than offset start-up
costs for its Entertainment Weekly, which it launched Monday.
   The company's filmed entertainment division, which includes
Warner Brothers Studios, had operating income of $80 million,
compared with a loss of $20 million in fourth quarter 1988.
   Time Warner said it continued to profit from the success of the
motion picture ``Batman,'' which was in videocassette release
domestically and theatrical distribution overseas during the
quarter.
   The company's recorded music and publishing division, which
includes Warner Records, had operating income of $141 million, up
11 percent from a year earlier.
   Operating income at the company's cable television division was
up 58 percent to $180 million. Time Warner said the results partly
reflected the addition of a Florida cable system acquired from
Centel Corp.
   Time Warner's programming division, which includes Home Box
Office and Cinemax, had operating income of $37 million, compared
with a loss of $1 million a year earlier.
   The company's book division had a loss of $134 million,
reflecting the Scott Foresman sale, compared with operating income
of $35 million in fourth-quarter 1988.
   John Reidy, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said
Time Warner had a ``solid quarter.'' Judging by the performance of
the company's various divisions, cash flow for 1989 was in line
with expectations, he said.
   Analysts are more concerned with Time Warner's ability to pay
its debts and shrugged off the company's losses. ``They're
meaningless,'' said Pavlos Alexandrakis at Argus Research Corp.
   Alexandrakis also said Time Warner's cash flow would be enough
to service its debt load.
   For the year, Time Warner said it lost $987 million, or $17.29
per share, compared with a loss of $1.14 billion, or $19.84 a
share, in 1988.
   Full-year revenue totaled $10.78 billion, up from $9.1 billion.
   The results for all of 1989 also include the costs of the Warner
acquisition. Operating income for the year totaled $1.92 billion,
up from $1.33 billion in 1988.

   The stock market, beset by renewed interest-rate
and recession worries, declined broadly Monday in the quietest
session so far this year.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 45.50 points last
week, fell 29.06 to 2,619.14.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
479 up, 1,042 down and 442 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 118.39 million
shares, down from 146.91 million Friday and the lightest total
since a 77.61 million-share day on Dec. 26.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 146.92 million shares.
   Activity was curtailed, as expected, by a national holiday in
Japan and the absence of some U.S. investors observing the
Lincoln's Birthday holiday.
   Analysts said traders had been encouraged by the results of the
Treasury's auction of notes and bonds last week, which generally
went off better than had been expected. That provided some relief
from recent worries over rising interest rates.
   But many market participants remained edgy over the outlook for

   For several weeks now Wall Streeters have been worrying that
rising rates overseas would push U.S. rates higher as well,
increasing the chances of a recession.
   On top of all that, brokers cited uncertainty surrounding the
outlook for the prominent investment firm of Drexel Burnham
Lambert, which said it was looking for a merger partner or other
source of capital.
   ASA Ltd. dropped 4{ to 64&rsqb;. ASA is a closed-end fund that

   Conversely, precious metals stocks not directly exposed to the

   Berkshire Hathaway, by far the highest-priced issue traded at
the NYSE, fell 730 to 7220. An article in Barron's magazine argued
that the stock was overvalued based on the investments the company
holds.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $30.13 billion, or 0.93
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 1.84 to 182.55.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 4.29 to 381.28, ad S&amp;P's

   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
slumped 2.46 to 426.38. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 358.87, down 1.92.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev told East German leaders
a reunited Germany cannot belong to the NATO alliance, the state
news agency ADN said Monday.
   The Soviet leader's stand disagrees with the United States and
Western European nations, who oppose a neutral Germany with no ties
to the Western military alliance.
   East Germany rejected a West German proposal Wednesday for quick
adoption of a common currency, but approved the principle of a
monetary union.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany, trying to hasten
reunification, has said a single currency should be adopted soon to
help resolve East Germany's severe economic problems.
   East German leaders asked West Germany on Monday for financial
aid of up to $9 billion, but the West Germans said no. Finance
Minister Theo Waigel said there was ``no sense'' in financing a
``system that has still not decided to make fundamental changes and
has not shown it is capable of doing so.''
   About 70,000 East Germans turned out Monday evening for the
weekly pro-democracy rally in Leipzig. Dozens carried West German
flags and one banner read: ``If the West German mark comes, we'll
stay. If the West German mark doesn't show up, we'll go to join
it.''
   ADN, the official East German news agency, said two young people
were slightly injured in scuffles with about 75 to 100 right-wing
radicals who showed up in Leipzig.
   About 80,000 people held a rally in Karl-Marx-Stadt and chants
of ``Germany, one fatherland!'' rang through the city.
   Last year, 340,000 East Germans moved to prosperous, capitalist
West Germany. They now stream West at the rate of 1,800 a day,
making the economic chaos in East Germany even worse.
   The exodus helped bring down the old hard-line Communist
government, beginning in October, and now encourages a growing
reunification movement. What remains of the Communist Party in East
Germany has tried to slow the process.
   On Tuesday, Kohl and Hans Modrow, East Germany's Communist
premier, are to meet in Bonn. Foreign ministers of the European
Community said in Brussels that Kohl would make Modrow an official
offer of monetary union.
   They said Waigel mentioned the plan at a meeting of EC ministers
Monday. No details were released.
   Kohl said he got the ``green light'' for unification from
Gorbachev during a weekend visit to Moscow, but the official East
German agency ADN reported Monday the Soviet leader insisted a
united Germany stay out of NATO.
   The chancellor has said repeatedly that West Germany is firmly
in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and has rejected
neutrality for a single Germany.
   ADN said Gorbachev told Modrow by telephone he had ``clearly
told'' Kohl a ``united Germany staying within the structure of NATO
cannot be accepted.''
   Gorbachev said the ``question of military structures and
questions of political status can only be solved in a gradual
transition,'' the agency reported.
   Its dispatch gave no details on Gorbachev's position about the
Western military alliance, but said he acknowledged German unity
could come ``more quickly than previously thought.'' ADN indicated
Gorbachev initiated the conversation with Modrow.
   In Washington, President Bush said: ``We support Chancellor
Kohl's position that a unified Germany should remain a member of
NATO. Let me also express my appreciation of Chairman Gorbachev's
statesmanlike view that decisions regarding German unity should be
left to the people of Germany.''
   Kohl has denied West Germany wants to ``annex'' the East, but
comments from East Berlin indicate growing resentment to pressure
from Bonn.
   At the weekly talks Monday between the government and other
organizations, a set of guidelines was approved for Modrow's
meeting with Kohl.
   Most important was rejection of speedy action toward the single
currency Kohl says is necessary to bolster the East German economy.
The panel added, however, that monetary union eventually could be
an ``important measure for the creation of a German economic
system.''
   Sixteen political parties and other groups are represented in
the weekly ``round table'' discussions, which are part of the
interim administration guiding East Germany to free elections March
18.
   On Monday, panel members warned against ``artificial overheating
of the German process.'' The guidelines said reunification ``cannot
endanger European integration.''

<HEAD>Judge Gives Eastern Eight-Day Extension on Reorganization Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge on Monday gave
Eastern Airlines another eight days to file its proposed plan of
reorganization, after several parties in the proceeding said
progress has been made toward agreement on a plan.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland granted Eastern's
request for the extension, to Feb. 20, of the deadline for filing
its bankruptcy reorganization plan. During that time, other parties
such as creditors cannot submit competing proposals.
   Miami-based Eastern has been restructuring under bankruptcy
court supervision since a grueling strike began last March 4. The
airline asked the court last week for a 30-day extension but
reduced its request before Monday's hearing, indicating that
Eastern and its major creditors may have moved toward compromise on
a plan.
   David I. Shapiro, the court-appointed examiner overseeing
Eastern's Chapter 11 proceeding, supported the request and told
Lifland that ``substantial progress'' is being made in negotiations
between the airline and its creditors.
   Shapiro said last week he would fight liquidation of Eastern, as
rumors circulated that Texas Air Corp., Eastern's owner, would opt
for a Chapter 7 liquidation.
   The committee representing unsecured creditors also supported
Eastern's petition.
   Representatives of preferred shareholders, who recently
advocated liquidation or outright sale, supported the airline's
request for more time, however.
   In papers filed earlier in bankruptcy court, a committee
representing tthe preferred holders said it had lost faith in
Eastern's management because it was ``cannibalizing'' the airline
by selling vital assets.
   The preferred shareholders criticized Eastern's latest
reorganization proposal, recently diclosed publicly, which proposes
to pay them no more than 10 cents on the dollar in the form of new
stock.
   ``We are examining all of our various options; we're hopeful we
can come up with a solution,'' Robert Miller, an attorney for the
preferred shareholders' committee, said after the hearing.
   The new plan also calls for paying unsecured creditors only 10
percent of their debts in cash when the airline emerges from
bankruptcy protection, and 70 percent more over the following 10
years, without interest.
   In return for accepting partial repayment, Texas Air would give
the unsecured creditors 40 percent of Eastern's equity.
   Lawyers representing the Air Line Pilots Association and the
Machinists union opposed Eastern's request.
   The pilots and flight attendants abandoned their sympathy
strikes just before Thanksgiving, but Eastern had since rebuilt as
a smaller carrier and hired mostly non-union workers to replace the
strikers. The Machinists union remains on strike against the
carrier.
   Monday's extension was the fourth granted by Lifland to Eastern
since the bankruptcy proceeding began last March 9.

<HEAD>Soviet Ambassador Says Political Changes Helping Economic Recovery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet Ambassador Yuriy V. Dubinin said Monday
that the recent historic meeting of the Communist Party Central
Committee has given ``a powerful political impetus'' to the Soviet
Union's plans for economic restructuring.
   Dubinin, speaking to a business audience about joint ventures in
the USSR, said the committee's agreement last week to accept a
multiparty system and adopt a new platform of reforms would help
accelerate the country's economic recovery and expand trade with
the West.
   The Soviet Union's economic agenda includes taking emergency
steps to rebuild the economy and laying a foundation for economic
development, Dubinin said. It also includes creating a legal system
with laws on property, employment and taxes; decentralizing the
economies of republics within the country; making the currency
convertible; and reducing foreign debt, he said.
   However, Dubinin said, the ``natural mutual attraction'' between
the U.S. and Soviet business communities could be destroyed by
``the cold war or severe restrictions.''
   ``Shall we postpone our business interaction until better
times?'' Dubinin asked.
   ``I believe the answer lies in the fact that...we are already
experiencing an explosion of interest on the part of American
businesses toward establishing ties with Soviet business.''
   Dubinin underscored the need for a U.S.-Soviet trade agreement
that would relax trade barriers between the two countries and help
remove obstacles to granting the Soviet Union most-favored-nation
trade status, a move that could ease the economic troubles under
which the Soviets are living.
   Top U.S. and Soviet trade officials on Monday began negotiations
in Washington aimed at reaching a new trade treaty by the time of
the June summit between Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and
President George Bush.
   Dubinin said more than 1,000 joint ventures have been registered
between Soviet and Western companies in the last year. And more
than a dozen more joint venture agreements will be signed with
major American companies in the next few months.
   However, only about a fifth of those registered have become
reality due to the structural and economic problems in the Soviet
Union.
   ``We are trying to solve those problems,'' Dubinin said.
   The ambassador said the so-called ``economic conversion,'' or
the converting of Soviet military plants into facilities for
manufacturing consumer goods, is helping lessen the political
tension between the Soviet Union and the West while helping in the
recovery.
   ``Conversion serves to accelerate economic development
and...opens new horizons,'' Dubinin said.
   Dubinin said he returned on Sunday from Moscow, where he
attended meetings of the Communist Party Central Committee and
meetings with Secretary of State James A. Baker III that wound up
Saturday.

<HEAD>Fewer Thrifts Falling Short of Financial Standards, Regulators Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fewer savings and loans are falling short of
tough new financial standards than originally feared, thrift
regulators said Monday.
   Of 861 S&amp;Ls originally thought to be short of capital, 147 have
demonstrated they meet new standards that took effect Dec. 7, the
Office of Thrift Supervision said. The claims of an additional 43
are being evaluated.
   Thrift office Director M. Danny Wall said the 18 percent
improvement over earlier expectations ``doesn't come as a big
surprise'' because industry data showed that thrifts were shrinking
their operations in order to compy with the capital standards,
imposed as part of the S&amp;L bailout bill last August.
   S&amp;Ls that fell short of the standards were required to submit
recovery plans by Jan. 8. Regulators have from 50 to 80 days,
depending on the circumstance, to approve or reject the plans. So
far, they have rejected 53 and approved two.

   The annual American International Toy Fair that
opened Monday provides an opportunity for manufacturers to showcase
their latest creations and classics. Here are brief sketches of
some of the dolls, toys and games being introduced this year:
   _Dolls:
   My Pretty Ballerina is a battery-powered doll that dances. The
doll, from Tyco Toys, performs on her toes and executes moves on
one leg with the help of someone guiding her arm.
   New Kids on the Block dolls based on the five-member singing
group from Hasbro Inc. are expected to be a rage with teeny-boppers.
   _Plush Toys:
   Peeper Pals is a line of stuffed animals that also function as
night lights. When pressed on their bellies, the battery-powered
pals from Lewis Galoob Toys Inc. open their eyes, which light up.
   Zoo Tunes are high-tech hand puppets made by Worlds of Wonder
Inc. Three animals _ a lion, hippo and alligator _ sing children's
songs. The pupeteer controls the tempo by opening and closing the
puppet's mouth.
   Guard dogs from Nasta Industries are electronically activated
dogs that bark but look like soft, cuddly stuffed animals. They
have special pouches to stash valuables. If someone tries to unlock
the combination or pick up the dog, it barks.

   Gorbachev, named for the Soviet leader, is a family game in
which players must acquire Western-style consumer and luxury goods.
Special Gorbachev cards help players cut through red tape in their
buying binge as they advance around a board. The player with the
most goods at the end wins. It is made by the Milton Bradley
division of Hasbro Inc.
   Taboo is another family game from Milton Bradley. Players must
guess words via one-word clues from their teammates but five
obvious clues cannot be used. For instance, the clues ``space,''
``shuttle,'' ``moon,'' ``John Glenn'' or ``NASA'' can't be given
for the word ``astronaut.''
   Motor Mouth, from Tiger Electronics Inc., is a family game
co-designed by John Moschitta, known for his fast-talking
deliveries in radio and television commercials. The object of the
game is to successfully move around a board by correctly reading a
series of tongue twisters.

<TEXT>
   Oil futures prices rose in moderate trading
Monday, helped mainly by technical factors and protective buying by
investors.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the main grade of U.S. crude oil, rose 29 cents
to $22.03 a 42-gallon barrel. The contract posted a net loss of
$1.28 last week.
   The April crude contract climbed 28 cents to $21.84 and May
added 26 cents to $21.66 a barrel.
   Among refined products, March wholesale unleaded gasoline, which
fell 1.61 cents on Friday, rose 0.84 cent to 60.40 cents a gallon.
April gained 1.16 cents to 61.41 cents and May ended up 0.59 at
64.84 cents a gallon.
   No. 2 heating oil for March delivery, which had lost ground in
recent sessions pressured by warm weather in the Northeast,
finished at 55.95 cents a gallon, up 0.87 cent. The April contract
rose 0.65 cent to 55.27 cents and May added 0.55 cent to 54.61
cents.
   Analysts said there was little news to move the petroleum
markets.
   ``There was more movement than news,'' said Peter Beutel, energy
analyst with Elders Futures Inc. ``It seemed to have been short
covering that boosted prices.''
   Prices had been under pressure recently from industry and
government reports that showed an increase in crude and product
supplies in the nation's storage tanks.
   Analysts also attributed the recent weakness in crude prices to
an announcement by a few big refiners last week that they would be
doing annual maintenance turnarounds in March and April. The
maintenance requires refiners to slow operations, which suggests
they would be using less crude oil.

<HEAD>Avon Posts Quarterly Loss Due to Charge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Avon Products Inc. said Monday that it lost
$25.7 million in 1989's fourth quarter due to a $97.8 million
charge to cover the cost of discontinuing two health care divisions.
   But the beauty products company said it had a profit of $54.6
million, or 34 cents a share, for all of last year. That was an
improvement from 1988's deficit of $404.5 million, or $6.79 a
share, which had been caused by $545.6 million in losses from
discontinued operations.
   The loss for the three months ended Dec. 31, which came to 61
cents a share, compared with a profit of $56.6 million, or 89 cents
a share, in the final 1988 quarter.
   Sales in the latest quarter amounted to $1.03 billion, up 2
percent from $1.01 billion in the corresponding 1988 quarter. For
all of last year, sales rose 8 percent to $3.3 billion from 1988's
$3.1 billion.
   The non-cash charge taken in the fourth quarter was for two
Mediplex health care divisions and reflects the divisions'
realizable value, the company said in a news release.
   Avon, which has been divesting its holdings in the health care
field to focus on its core direct selling business, said it has
reached an agreement to sell all the shares of Mediplex Group Inc.
for $100 million in cash and notes convertible to cash.
   The buyer, Diamond Healthcare Acquisition Corp., will assume
Mediplex's leases, mortgages and liabilities.
   With the sale, Avon will have divested all of its health care
operations. Proceeds will be used to reduce debt.
   Avon said earnings from continuing operations were up 27 percent
in the fourth quarter and 26 percent in 1989.

   Shareholders of Canadian
appliance-maker Inglis Ltd. approved the company's purchase by
Whirlpool Corp. for $28.38 a share, or about $42 million, Whirlpool
said Monday.
   Inglis, affiliated with Whirlpool for more than 40 years,

   Inglis, headquartered in Mississauga, Ontario, will continue
making Inglis, Whirlpool, Admiral, Speed Queen and KitchenAid brand
appliances at its plants in Port Credit, Cambridge and Montmagny,
serving the Canadian marketplace.
   Inglis reported 1989 earnings of $9.3 million on sales of $349

   The bigger they are, the harder they fall.
   Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Wall Street's priciest stock, tumbled
$730 a share Monday in a sell-off that brokers blamed on negative
publicity in a Barron's magazine story.
   The stock's preeminence remained untouched, however. Even with
the drop, Berkshire Hathaway was still trading at $7,220 a share,
keeping it in a class by itself on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Barron's said the company, a hodgepodge of insurance and
investment concerns controlled by legendary multibillionaire Warren
Buffett, has become extremely overvalued since Buffett switched
trading in the stock from the over-the-counter market to the NYSE
in 1988.
   J. Verne McKenzie, Berkshire Hathaway's chief financial officer
and spokesman for Omaha-based company, said ``no comment'' when
asked about the Barron's report and the stock slide.
   A total of 1,450 shares traded hands in the sell-off.
   The shares have been on the decline since peaking at $8,900 late
last year.
   Barron's suggested that Buffett's investment miscalculations
were largely responsible. The magazine said some of Buffet's recent
investments have not been made based on his celebrated adherence to
buying into companies with sound balance sheets and strong
management.
   Berkshire Hathaway's genesis was a struggling textile mill that
Buffett acquired 25 years ago, then trading at $12 a share. Over
the years, Buffett expanded and strengthened the company into a
conglomerate with stakes in enterprises ranging from insurance
giant Geico Corp. to the Washington Post Co.

   MCI, a long-distance telephone carrier, had
dialing problems Monday afternoon but said the trouble was confined
to callers in the Washington area.
   ``Customers were experiencing a slow dial tone,'' said MCI
spokesman David Thompson. ``Based on the information we have, it
looks like a hardware problem.''
   A slow dial tone, he said, meant the customer experienced a lag
between the time the number was dialed and the time the destination
telephone began ringing.
   The nation's major long-distance carrier, AT&amp;T, suffered a major
failure Jan. 15 when it was unable to connect long-distance calls
because of a computer problem in New York.
   Thompson characterized MCI's problem as ``very localized, minor
... nothing major at all.'' There also was some trouble with calls
coming into the Washington area, he said.
   The company's electronic mail and toll-free 800 service were not
affected, Thompson said.
   The problem occurred about 4 p.m. EST when the volume of
business calls was tapering off, Thompson said, adding that most
service had been restored by 5:30 p.m.

<TEXT>
   Nissan Motor Corp. said Monday it would begin
airing regional television ads for its Infiniti luxury cars
featuring the vehicles in their entirety, instead of simply showing
scenes of rocks, birds and pussy willows.
   The ads, the second stage of the company's unusual advertising
campaign for the cars, will air in less than 45 television markets,
where Infiniti has dealerships, company officials said.
   Nissan drew some automotive ad industry barbs when its Infiniti
ad campaign began last year with ads that featured such scenes as
countrysides or fields, but did not show the car.
   The new ads will be broadcast on network affiliates in Infiniti
markets during local news and prime time shows for the next 3{
months.
   Nissan is broadcasting the new ads regionally because each of
the spots will carry the area dealer's name, said Nissan spokesman
Bob Thomas. The original ads, carried on television, newspaper and
in magazines, were intended to create name recognition for the new
auto line.
   ``If you had to do advertising to get a name established, we did
that in spades,'' said Thomas Mignanelli, executive vice president
of the company's U.S. sales arm.
   Mignanelli also said Monday the company was offering too many
cars in the United States, and indicated it may cut the size of its
sports car lineup.
   ``We probably ought to have one or two (car lines) less,'' he
said. ``We've got all the bases covered. You have to say how many
sports cars do you need?''
   Within the last year, Nissan has introduced its 240SX and 300ZX
and the new Pulsar NX sports cars. Nissan is setting up a new
organization in southern California designed to streamline its
product development process in North America, he said.
   The organization, called Nissan North America, will coordinate
operations of the eight other companies Nissan runs in the United
States.
   ``It's a transfer of the planning and review process to the
United States,'' Mignanelli said.
   During the last year, Nissan broke ground for a huge research
and development center northwest of Detroit to bring research for
future U.S. products closer to the company's plant in Smyrna,
Tenn., and to the market where the cars will be sold.
   ``It provides us with a lot more say in our company,'' said
Mignanelli. ``We can do a project from the seed to the tree in the
United States.''

   Platinum futures prices jumped Monday after Nelson Mandela
endorsed anti-apartheid violence and nationalization of South
Africa's mining industry, sending a shudder of supply fear through
the precious metals markets.
   On other commodity markets, oil futures fell; coffee futures
rose; grains and soybeans were mostly higher; and livestock and
meat futures were mixed.
   Platinum futures settled $9.80 to $10.10 higher on the New York
Mercantile Exchange with the contract for delivery in April up
$9.80 at $523.90 a troy ounce.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold finished $3 to $3.20
higher with February at $419.20 a troy ounce; silver was 2.8 cents
to 3.2 cents higher with March at $5.305 a troy ounce.
   South Africa is the world's largest producer of both platinum
and gold. It dominates in platinum, accounting for an estimated 2.6
million, or nearly 80 percent, of the estimated 3.3 million ounces
produced last year, according to British refiner Johnson Matthey
PLC.
   Mandela, the African National Congress leader who was freed
Sunday after 27 years in South African prison, said in a speech
that ANC bombings and sabotage were defensive acts against
apartheid and that the party's call for nationalization of mineral
and diamond minds was ``quite correct.''
   Those statements, along with reports of 30 deaths in scattered
South African violence since Sunday morning, smashed perceptions
that Mandela's release signified easing racial and political
tensions.
   ``Anything that causes uncertainty, anything that even hints at
the possibility of less reliability as far as source of supply is
concerned, is bullish for the platinum market,'' said Bernard
Savaiko, senior metals analyst at PaineWebber Inc.
   Mine sabotage poses obvious production problems while the ANC's
call for mine nationalization ``leaves open the possibility that
the flow of supply will diminish because of the inefficiencies of
government-owned mining operations as opposed to those controlled
by free enterprise,'' Savaiko said.
   Oil futures rallied late in an otherwise lackluster session on
the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Ray Mazzeo, energy futures specialist with Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc., said the rally was inspired by technical market
factors and did not appear to have much staying power.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 12 cents to 29 cents
higher with March at $22.03 a barrel; heating oil was .51 cent to
.87 cent higher with March at 55.95 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .84 cent to 1.5 cents higher with March at 60.4 cents
a gallon.
   The threat of a Brazilian port strike pushed coffee futures to
new five-month highs on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange.
   Leaders of the dockworkers union voted Saturday to recommend
that their members strike, beginning this Saturday, if their wage
demands are not met by Thursday.
   Coffee futures settled 1.21 cents to 2 cents higher with March
at 86.27 cents a pound.
   Most grain and soybean futures advanced on the Chicago Board of
Trade, bolstered by perceptions of shrinking supplies and hopes for
new grain sales to the Soviet Union.
   Wheat futures settled \ cent lower to 3\ cents higher with March
at $3.90 a bushel; corn was 2{ cents to 3{ cents higher with March
at $2.42 a bushel; oats were 1{ cents to 2} cents higher with March
at $1.39{ a bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents lower to 2{ cents higher
with March at $5.65\ a bushel.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, cattle futures for near-term
delivery were supported by forecasts for cold, snowy weather in the
Great Plains, which could delay marketings. Similar concerns
prompted buying of pork futures amid predictions the same storm is
headed for the Midwest.
   Live cattle ended .05 cent lower to .47 cent higher with
February at 79.67 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower
to .10 cent higher with March at 81.85 cents a pound; live hogs
were .22 cent lower to .58 cent higher with February at 49.27 cents
a pound; frozen pork bellies were .15 cent lower to .40 cent higher
with February at 49.55 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Great Northern Calls Georgia-Pacific, Three Executives Liars</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. asked a
federal judge Monday to block Georgia-Pacific Corp.'s $3.8 billion
hostile bid for the rival paper company, charging that
Georgia-Pacific lied about plans to sell Great Northern assets.
   Meanwhile, Georgia-Pacific announced the sales of its own assets
in three states to avoid antitrust problems that could develop if
it succeeds with its $63 a share offer.
   In federal court in Portland, Great Northern attorney Bernard
Nussbaum asked U.S. District Judge Gene Carter for a preliminary
injunction halting the takeover attempt as well as
Georgia-Pacific's efforts to oust Great Northern's board at a
special shareholders meeting March 2.
   Great Northern accused Georgia-Pacific of violating federal
securities laws by trying to cover up plans to sell Great Northern
assets, including two mills and 2.1 million acres of woodlands in
Maine, if its completes its planned takeover.
   ``G.P. is lying. They're not telling you their true plans,''
Nussbaum told Carter.
   Nussbaum said handwritten notes and typed memos from
consultants, bankers and Georgia-Pacific itself demonstrated that
the Atlanta-based paper giant has planned since at least 1984 to
sell the assets.
   Georgia-Pacific attorney Stuart J. Baskin in turn accused Great
Northern of ``pandering to the poor people in Maine'' through an
unfair motion that has no basis in law.
   Baskin said Georgia-Pacific has produced depositions and
affidavits from 14 people, including Georgia-Pacific executives,
consultants and bankers, who dispute Great Northern's contentions
about a planned asset sale.
   The judge said he would rule on Great Northern's request as
quickly as possible.
   After Monday's hearing, lawyers for both sides met with Carter
and agreed to unseal a motion for a preliminary injunction filed
last month by Georgia-Pacific, which alleged Great Northern's
directors breached their fiduciary duty by resisting the offer.
   Great Northern has rejected Georgia-Pacific's bid as inadequate.
However, Georgia-Pacific contends, Great Northern's investment
banker, Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., conducted a study last spring that put
the value of Great Northern's stock at somewhere between $46.39 per
share and $68.75 per share.
   The motion asked the judge to force Great Northern to forgo its
``poison pill'' takeover defense and to strike down ``golden
parachute'' payments to Great Northern's executives if they lose
their jobs in the battle.
   Georgia-Pacific also asked the judge to force Great Northern's
directors to refrain from using Maine's anti-takeover law to block
the merger.
   Great Northern issued a statement saying the Goldman Sachs study
was ``stale'' and ``originally prepared for a different purpose
than evaluating a bid for the company.''
   Also Monday, Great Northern filed papers saying it wanted to
pursue a speedy appeal of an order last week from Carter, who ruled
it would take a two-thirds vote by Great Northern's shareholders to
oust the Great Northern board.
   Great Northern's bylaws called for a three-fourths vote, but the
judge agreed with Georgia-Pacific that two-thirds was the most
allowed under Maine corporate law.
   Georgia-Pacific said Monday it had agreed to sell safety-paper
operations in Vermont, Iowa and New York to remove an antitrust
question in the takeover attempt.
   The company said it was selling facilities in Gilman, Vt., and
Burlington, Iowa, to Seattle-based Simpson Paper Co.
   The deal also calls for the sale of two wet process machines and
a precision sheeter in Warwick, N.Y.
   The Gilman plant employs about 200 people making safety paper,
which is used in personal checks, securities certificates and other
documents that need to be protected against forgery. The Burlington
plant employs about 20 workers.

   The new chairman of the Federated and Allied
retail chains became the subject of a lawsuit Monday when his
former employer, Neiman Marcus Group, claimed he was lured away in
violation of his contract.
   Neiman Marcus, part of General Cinema Corp. in suburban Newton,
said it filed the suit in state court in Dallas, Texas, where the
group's Neiman Marcus Division is based.
   Named as defendants are Federated Department Stores Inc., Allied
Stores Corp. and Canadian property company Olympia &amp; York
Developments Ltd., which provided a $250 million cash infusion last
year to Campeau Corp., the Toronto-based owner of Allied and
Federated.
   Neiman Marcus Group accused the defendants of ``tortious
interference'' in enticing Allen Questrom to become the chairman
and chief executive officer of Federated and Allied, which filed
for bankruptcy protection Jan. 15.
   Questrom was hired this month to oversee the troubled retail
chains.
   But in a statement, Neiman Marcus said the defendants pursued
him for the new position ``although they knew or should have known
that Mr. Questrom had a valid employment contract which obligated
him to serve as head of the Neiman Marcus Division until September
1991.''
   The retailers, based in Cincinnati, declined to comment on the
suit.
   The Neiman Marcus Group consists of three operating units:
Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman and Contempo Casuals.

<HEAD>Computer Industry Criticizes Proposed Supercomputer Definition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Suggested government regulations defining
supercomputers are too broad and would handcuff U.S. manufacturers,
industry officials said Monday as the Department of Commerce began
public hearings on its proposals.
   Although conceding there is a national interest in strict
controls over the biggest and fastest computers, experts said the
suggested definition of a ``supercomputer'' is so broad it could
include some personal computers within a few months.
   ``We have to make sure that we're controlling supercomputers and
not everything else in the world,'' said Terry Rock, a vice
president of Convex Computer Corp., a Richardson-based manufacturer
of so-called ``mini-supercomputers.''
   The Commerce Department has proposed defining a supercomputer as
a machine with a total peak performance of 100 million
floating-point operations per second, a measure of the speed with
which machines add, subtract, multiply or divide very large numbers.
   The rules would require an export permit for machines with a
performance of 100 Mflops or greater. Machines with a capacity of
150 Mflops and 300 Mflops could only be sold to 22 U.S. allies and
even then under strict guidelines, including certification of
security and access limitations.
   The industry is concerned that the proposed regulation, written
in consultation with the Department of Defense, will hamper its
ability to compete with computer makers internationally.
   ``It's obviously of great importance that we balance the
requirements of security with a minimum negative impact on
competition,'' said Stanley Sienkiewicz, the Commerce Department
associate deputy undersecretary who conducted Monday's hearing in
Dallas.
   ``Setting a 100 Mflops threshold for supercomputers today will
soon make it very difficult for both U.S. computer and
semiconductor manufacturers to effectively compete in the world
market,'' said Murray Goldman, head of the microprocessor group at
Motorola Inc., the No. 1 U.S. computer chip manufacturer.
   D.J. Thompson, a Dallas-based industry consultant, said a better
definition would be a machine with a 500 Mflop to 600 Mflop rating.
   ``This sort of system would have particular usefulness in the
known `strategic' applications, for instance, code-breaking, fluid
flow calculations, (anti-submarine warfare) signal processing and
the like,'' Thompson said.
   ``If one is truly speaking of `supercomputers' as understood by
the industry, the security controls are not at all onerous,'' he
said. ``A supercomputer is an expensive and delicate piece of
capital equipment and physical access to it and its use would
certainly be controlled and in a very strict way.''
   Industry officials also complained Monday about the pace of the
regulation-making, noting that rapid technology advances could make
the rules unrealistic almost before they take effect.
   ``Given the current performance trend for microprocessors, you
will soon need a 1,000 Mflops definition for a supercomputer, not
the 100 to 300 range you are currently evaluating,'' said
Motorola's Goldman. ``By the late 90s, we will see such systems
common on engineers' desks.''
   Commerce officials indicated they were sympathetic to the
industry's concerns, and hoped the public hearings will provide
evidence to help overcome Defense Department concerns about the
low-range computers.
   Other hearings are scheduled for Wednesday in Santa Clara,
Calif., the heart of the Silicon Valley; Boston, another high-tech
center, on Friday; and Feb. 19 in Minneapolis, home of Cray
Research Inc., the U.S. leader in supercomputers.
   The information gathered at the hearings will be reviewed by the
Commerce and Defense departments, and it will be several months
before a final regulation is prepared.

   Reacting to last year's apple chemical fear
and the Chilean fruit cyanide scare, the nation's fruit and
vegetable suppliers and buyers opened their convention Monday with
a predictable theme: produce safety.
   ``If it is an area of concern by the consumer, we have to
reassure them,'' said Jim Halloran, spokesman for the Chilean
Winter Fruit Association.
   His organization's members are among more than 7,500 attending
the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association's annual
convention, where the food safety question seeped into almost every
presentation.
   Association spokesman John McClung said produce safety is the
biggest issue at the group's 86th convention, but food safety has
been a concern for years.
   ``I am always amazed about the resiliency of the food safety
issue in the public mind,'' said McClung, emphasizing that though
specific food safety concerns wane, the overall question remains.
``The next issue to come along always attracts attention.''
   Roger Blobaum, director of Americans for Safe Food, a project of
the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said he believes the
fruit and vegetable industry is moving away from use of chemicals
and pesticides.
   ``There's a considerable amount of consumer interest and
pressure to reduce pesticide residue,'' Blobaum said Monday in a
telephone interview. ``We're encouraged by a lot of things that we
see.''
   He said his Washington-based organization has worked with the
United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association and similar groups to
promote food safety.
   The fruit and vegetable association has helped form the
non-profit Center for Produce Quality to spread its message that
produce is safe, McClung said.
   The entire produce industry in the United States represents
about $60 billion a year, although that includes retail and several
levels of wholesale sales, McClung said. About 30 percent of
produce is imported.
   In a speech to the produce association, Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter said he said he was concerned that food safety laws
may be affected by emotion rather than science.
   Last winter, a widely publicized consumer report linked the
chemical Alar to a long-term health threat. Alar is the trade name
for a spray that keeps apples red and fresh longer.
   On the heels of that controversy, traces of cyanide were found
in two grapes from Chile. The Food and Drug Administration ordered
Chilean fruit held at ports where it was entering the United
States, and FDA officials urged stores to remove the fruit from
their shelves.
   No other tainted fruit was found. However, millions of dollars
worth of produce went bad while it was held for the federal
inspections.
   Produce industry officials say they'll bounce back despite last
year's setbacks.
   Chilean fruit, which also includes nectarines, peaches and
plums, undergoes the same type of inspections domestically grown
fruit does, Halloran said.
   ``It's kept under rather rigid quality control from the time
it's picked to the time it makes it to the supermarkets,'' he said.
``They (Chilean growers) are very concerned, and they're not going
to do anything ... to jeopardize the quality.''
   Grapes constitute about 70 percent of the fruit Chile exports,
and virtually all of the fresh grapes sold in the United States
during the winter months are from Chile.
   
   Another glitch in 1989 came during the U.S. military invasion in
Panama in December. Closing of the Panama Canal forced some ships
to wait several days before getting through.
   But Halloran said while there was a slight delay in getting
produce to market, fruit on the refrigerated ships wasn't damaged.
   The convention ends Wednesday.

<HEAD>U.S. Investor to Buy 9.6 Percent of Blue Arrow</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A large U.S. investor reportedly has agreed to
buy 9.2 percent of Blue Arrow PLC for $96.7 million to become the
biggest shareholder in the British company, whose chief asset is
the temporary employment agency Manpower Inc.
   Blue Arrow Chairman Mitchell Fromstein said he was delighted by
the investor's decision to purchase the shares from NatWest
Investment Bank, the British bank that has owned them since 1987.
   The investor was not identified, but The Milwaukee Journal
described it in its Monday editions as a major insurance company,
pension fund or private investment group. Manpower is based in
suburban Milwaukee.
   ``It's a marvelous late chapter in the story,'' Fromstein said,
adding the purchase would increase U.S. ownership of Blue Arrow to
more than 75 percent. ``It removes an overhang from the market
that's been there for two years.''
   Fromstein has proposed reincorporating Blue Arrow in the United
States. He said the identity of the U.S. buyer would be announced
when the transaction was completed on Wednesday.
   NatWest will take an $88.7 million loss on the stock sale, the
Journal reported.
   The disclosure in 1988 that NatWest had owned the shares for a
year jolted Britain's financial community because British
regulations require public disclosure when anyone owns 5 percent or
more of a public company.
   As a result, the bank's top executives were dismissed, and
criminal charges eventually were filed against 10 executives of the
bank and a brokerage firm. The cases have yet to go to trial.
   NatWest acquired the shares through its investment banking
subsidiary, County NatWest, which underwrote an offering of new
stock to finance Blue Arrow's $1.3 billion acquisition of Manpower.
   County NatWest wasn't able to sell all the shares, however, and
was forced to keep 66.7 million shares itself, or a 9.2 stake.
   The disclosure of the NatWest stake not only rocked the bank but
also helped erode confidence in former Blue Arrow Chairman Tony
Berry, who was ousted last year by Fromstein, the former president
of Manpower.

   Eastern Europe governments attempting to move
away from communism should seek to stabilize their budgets,
inflation and exchange rates before dealing with problems of trade,
industry and labor, a banking group advised Monday.
   Nevertheless, the other problems also have to be tackled soon,
said a report of the Institute of International Finance, an
association of major banks throughout the world.
   ``The problem of successfully liberalizing a distorted economy
can be likened to the problem of teaching a baby elephant to stand
up,'' it said.
   ``The order in which it straightens its legs is important only
to the extent that it influences the elephant's ability to
straighten them at all.''
   Titled ``Financial Sector Reform: Its Role in Growth and
Development,'' the study is based on the experience of Chile,
Greece, Malaysia, New Zealand and Tunisia.
   It said detailed priorities should vary from place to place.
   In some Third World countries, such as Malaysia, the study found
the main task was to build institutions where few or none existed,
to develop skilled people and to build the basis for a modern
economy.
   Most heavily indebted Latin American countries had followed
misguided policies for many years, the study said, adding that at
various times countries such as New Zealand, Tunisia, Greece and
Chile have made similar mistakes.
   The priorities listed by the study included:
   _ getting control and stabilizing taxation, government borrowing
and spending, credit and prices;
   _ decentralizing decisions, to get them out of the hands of
bureaucrasts and politicians and giving more authority to people
with information and incentives;
   _ developing a situation for healthy markets so that prices
reflect cost and scarcity, giving people the incentive to put their
money into useful investments;
   _ adopting an exchange rate that reflects actual value on the
market, getting rid of taxes on exports, high duties on imports and
preference for state-owned business;
   _ reorganizing state-owned business.
   The report warned that delay in financial changes may lead to
high inflation and instability in other parts of the economy.
   ``These issues are particularly important to the design of
programs in Central and Eastern Europe,'' said Horst Schulmann,
managing director of the institute.
   Pushing financial changes, including control of the government
budget and convertibility of local currencies into hard money, also
is the priority for Jeffrey Sachs, the Harvard University professor
who is advising Poland and Yugoslavia. Sachs said last week that
Poland is already beginning to see results in lower food prices.
   ``The Yugoslavs have also introduced full convertibility of the
dinar as of Jan. 1, backed by billions of dollars of foreign
exchange reserves,'' he told a business conference last week.
   ``The currency is perfectly stable, fixed against the
Deutschemark (the West German currency). I think it's a safer bet
than the dollar in the next few months because they are committed
and will be able to achieve stability.''

   The Communist Party embraced the principle of
private property Monday in a radical rejection of some of the
fundamentals of Marxism and Soviet socialism.
   ``The Communist Party of the Soviet Union believes the existence
of individual property, including ownership of the means of
production, does not contradict the modern stage in the country's
economic development,'' the party's new platform says.
   The platform was approved Wednesday by the party's policy-making
Central Committee but not published in final form until Monday.
   It represents Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's boldest
break with communist orthodoxy and contradicts public statements he
made just months ago.
   The platform says the party took into account the new hunger of
Soviet citizens for democracy and reform, as expressed by mass
rallies and local political organizing all over the country.
   The document also says the Communist Party supports:
   _ ``Protection of a citizen's personality and honor, the
immunity of his home and property, the secrecy of correspondence.''
   _ Citizen ``participation in running the affairs of society and
the state, freedom of speech, the press, meetings and
demonstrations and the formation of public organizations.''
   _ ``Man's free self-determination in the spiritual sphere, the
freedom of conscience and religion.''
   _ A stronger presidency that would further erode the power of
the party in favor of the government. Party officials said last
week they would would give up their constitutional monopoly on
power.
   Soviet laws long have promised wide political freedoms, but the
Communist Party has dominated every aspect of life and has been
intolerant of any challenge.
   It was in economics, the foundation of Marxist theory, that the
party made its strongest break with both its ideological heritage
and decades of Soviet practice.
   Marxist theory holds that factories and other means of producing
goods must be owned by the state rather than individuals because
private ownership inevitably results in one person exploiting the
labor of another.
   The platform bowed to Marxism by also proclaiming that any form
of property must prevent man's alienation from production or
exploitation, but it did not define either term.
   Communists intend to reform the top-heavy Soviet system, in
serious economic straits, into a ``planned-market economy based on
a diversity of property forms, competition between independent
manufacturers, a developed financial system and on the powerful
stimuli of personal and collective interest,'' said the platform,
published by the Tass news agency.
   It said state-owned property should be turned over to worker
control through leasing, contracts, joint-stock holdings and other
methods.

<TEXT>
   Vestron Inc., a film and video company
whose credits include ``Dirty Dancing'' and ``Hamburger Hill,''
announced Monday it has received a merger proposal from a party it
didn't identify.
   In a short statement, the Stamford-based company said it was
evaluating the proposal.
   The company said it has been meeting with several parties
regarding the merger or sale of the company or its businesses.
   J. Garrett Blowers, a company spokesman, did not immediately
return a telephone call Monday night to his office in New York
seeking comment.
   Vestron announced June 29 that it was undergoing restructuring
that involved the layoffs of 140 employess. The restructuring
included eliminating its theatrical distribution activities and
substantially reducing its feature film productions.
   The restructuring followed Security Pacific National Bank's
termination of a six-year, $100 million credit line in October
1988, the company said.
   Vestron officials, who said the reasons for the termination were
never made clear, filed suit Aug. 16 charging Security Pacific with
breach of contract.
   Vestron Pictures was launched in January 1986 as an offshoot of
Vestron Video, at the time the country's largest independent video
cassette distributor.
   Among the 8-year-old company's completed or near-finished films
are ``Little Monsters,'' starring Fred Savage; ``Fear'' with Ally
Sheedy; and ``Blue Steel'' with Jamie Lee Curtis.
   Vestron's recent releases include ``Earth Girls Are Easy,''
``The Rainbow,'' ``Wonderland,'' and ``Far From Home.''

   The juiciest gossip Monday in the Big Apple was
the separation of Ivana and Donald Trump, the billionaire developer
who had the foresight to perfect the art of the prenuptial deal.
   If the split sticks after 13 years of marriage, the prenuptial
agreement decrees that Ivana gets $25 million, plus the couple's
Greenwich, Conn., mansion and custody of the three children,
according to columnist Liz Smith, who broke the story in Sunday's
Daily News.
   The gossip mill was kept spinning by battling tabloids and TV
stations that can't get enough of the tuxedoed Trump and the
bejeweled, begowned, blond Ivana, fixtures on the social circuit.
   Statements from the Trumps did nothing to slow the mill. Her
attorney, Michael Kennedy, issued a release Monday saying: ``We do
not consider the so-called prenuptial agreement to be serious. It
will have no relevance to a court because it is unconscionable and
fraudulent.''
   Kennedy also called Ivana ``a family woman. Her marriage and her
family have always been the most important things in her life. Mr.
Trump has now left her and the children. While one hopes for a
reconciliation, my mandate, at this time, is to document the 13
years of marriage and partnership in the Trump holdings.''
   In response, a spokesman for Trump released this statement:
``The prenuptial agreement signed by Donald and Ivana Trump is a
long and detailed document which covers all aspects and is 100
percent enforceable in courts of law. The agreement they have was
updated approximately two years ago. Prior to that, this agreement
has been updated on numerous other occasions throughout the years.
In virtually every instance marital agreements have been upheld by
the courts.''
   ``The Donald,'' as Ivana affectionately called him in happier
times, keeps everything else _ a business and real estate empire
worth somewhere from $1.7 billion to $4 billion, depending on who's
counting.
   Trump was back in town Monday after witnessing another shocker _
James ``Buster'' Douglas' knockout of boxing champ Mike Tyson in
Tokyo. According to Smith, Trump's comment on that debacle was:
``He fought a bad fight and the other guy fought a brilliant
fight.''
   But the author of the best-selling ``The Art of the Deal''
wasn't making himself available for comment, spokesmen said,
leaving Smith's reports of jet- and car-phone conversations as the
latest word.
   ``It is better for Ivana and me to separate at this time,''
Trump told the columnist. ``But I am leaving because I want to
leave.
   ``Ivana is a wonderful woman and a very good woman and I like
her. We might even get back together. I can't say we won't. Who
knows what could happen?
   ``And as for those other women I have been linked with, well, I
want to say that we are all just friends and that's as far as it
goes.''
   Other women? The New York Post plastered the faces of actresses
Catherine Oxenberg and Marla Maples and skater Peggy Fleming across
the top of a page.
   Not that anyone is on the record claiming a romance, but the
``Aspen Argument'' was trotted out as evidence by all three
tabloids _ the News, Post and New York Newsday. The New York Times
devoted three paragraphs to the story Monday.
   In a restaurant in that Colorado ski spa over the holidays,
Ivana reportedly warned Maples, star of a movie called ``Maximum
Overdrive,'' to stay away from ``the Donald.'' The Trumps were then
seen arguing on the slopes.
   Trump, 43, has been seen all over town in past weeks with a
half-naked woman _ on the cover of Playboy magazine, that is.
   Inside, he says he enjoys flirting, but when asked if marriage
is monogamous to him, he replies: ``I don't have to answer that. I
never speak about my wife. ... My marriage is and should be a
personal thing.''
   Not anymore it isn't. The Post, citing an unidentified
confidante, quoted Trump as saying: ``I like Ivana, but we've grown
apart.
   ``Her level of arrogance has grown steadily worse in recent
years. The bottom line is I don't want to create another Leona
Helmsley.''
   Leona is the self-described hotel queen recently convicted of
tax evasion; at her trial, former employees described her as
ill-tempered and demanding.
   Trump gave his wife the job of renovating the Plaza Hotel in
Manhattan after running Trump Castle in Atlantic City, N.J.
   ``I have told Ivana, `Whatever Leona would do, do the opposite.
Be nice to everybody.' And she is nice, anyway,'' Trump told
Playboy.
   Ivana, a former Czechoslovakian ski racer and sometime model who
turns 41 next week, ducked photographers Sunday night outside the
Trump Tower, where the couple has a three-floor penthouse.
   Trump moved out Sunday night, the Post reported.
   Despite the headlines and the hiding out, The Trump
Organization's publicity machine kept grinding away.
   Monday's release was about how Trump saved a struggling East
Harlem candy maker by ordering 75,000 pieces of chocolate to place
on pillows at the Trump Plaza Hotel in Atlantic City. The press
release headline: ``Trump Creates a Sweet Valentine Dream.''

   The Communist Party embraced the principle of
private property Monday in a radical rejection of some of the
fundamentals of Marxism and Soviet socialism.
   ``The Communist Party of the Soviet Union believes the existence
of individual property, including ownership of the means of
production, does not contradict the modern stage in the country's
economic development,'' the party's new platform says.
   The platform was approved Wednesday by the party's policy-making
Central Committee but not published in final form until Monday.
   It represents Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's boldest
break with communist orthodoxy and contradicts public statements he
made just months ago.
   The platform did not make clear in what sense the party still
considers itself to be Communist, but pays homage to the creative
spirit of Marxism and the philosphy's humanistic outlook of
opposing religion and emphasizing man's daily existence.
   It also points with pride to the concepts of pensions, free
education and medical care and other social benefits that it says
the Soviet system pioneered.
   In deciding on sweeping changes, however, the platform says the
party took into account the new hunger of Soviet citizens for
democracy and reform, as expressed by mass rallies and local
political organizing all over the country.
   The document also says the Communist Party supports:
   _ ``Protection of a citizen's personality and honor, the
immunity of his home and property, the secrecy of correspondence.''
   _ Citizen ``participation in running the affairs of society and
the state, freedom of speech, the press, meetings and
demonstrations and the formation of public organizations.''
   _ ``Man's free self-determination in the spiritual sphere, the
freedom of conscience and religion.''
   _ A stronger presidency that would further erode the power of
the party in favor of the government. Party officials said last
week they would would give up their constitutional monopoly on
power.
   Soviet laws long have promised wide political freedoms, but the
Communist Party has dominated every aspect of life and has been
intolerant of any challenge.
   In a departure from one of the Marxist slogans once used to
justify rule by terror and liquidation of the middle class, the
party dismissed the concept of a dictatorship of the proletariat,
saying: ``The rule-of-law state of the whole people has no room for
dictatorship by any class.''
   It was in economics, the foundation of Marxist theory, that the
party made its strongest break with both its ideological heritage
and decades of Soviet practice.
   Marxist theory holds that factories and other means of producing
goods must be owned by the state rather than individuals because
private ownership inevitably results in one person exploiting the
labor of another.
   The platform bowed to Marxism by also proclaiming that any form
of property must prevent man's alienation from production or
exploitation.
   Communists intend to reform the top-heavy Soviet system, in
serious economic straits, into a ``planned-market economy based on
a diversity of property forms, competition between independent
manufacturers, a developed financial system and on the powerful
stimuli of personal and collective interest,'' the platform said.
   Central planning has left the Soviet Union chronically unable to
provide its people with adequate food, housing or consumer goods,
and the platform said the system had been ``characterized by
monopoly, lack of initiative, wastefulness, mismanagement and
disregard for consumers interests.''
   The platform also said state-owned property should be turned
over to worker control through leasing, contracts, joint-stock
holdings and other methods.
   Private property could face stiff resistance in many parts of
the country, where state schools have preached its evils for
generations. Sociologist Tatyana Zaslavskaya told Tass last week
that while 80 percent of the population of Latvia, a small Baltic
republic, approve of private property, the attitude was exactly the
opposite in many other areas.
   The young Soviet state under Lenin's leadership confiscated most
private property after the 1917 revolution, and Stalin's drive to
strip peasants of their land through collectivization in the 1930s
took millions of lives through famine, deportation and summary
execution.
   The platform also called for restructuring heavily subsidized
state prices as an indispensable prerequisite to the market's
regulation of the economy.
   Subsidies have kept many prices artificially low. A pound of
sugar costs 70 cents, a loaf of bread 33 cents and a bus ride and
most daily newspapers a few pennies apiece.
   The system has kept many inefficient industries afloat and has
meant there is rarely any direct relationship between the cost of
manufacture and retail prices.
   The platform introduces the concept of competition _ once taboo
among Communist ideologists _ as a necessary tool for regulating
prices and ensuring availability of goods and services. It calls
for legislation to break up state monopolies, trade, credit
services and insurance businesses to permit competitive consumer
services.
   As recently as last November, Gorbachev stated firm opposition
to permitting Soviet citizens to hold private property.
   Tass said at the time he told a student assembly he remained
committed to the Communist Manifesto, which calls for state
ownership of all means of production to ensure that workers get
full value for their effort without factory owners taking a share
as profit. The Manifesto is the blueprint for communism written in
1848 by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.
   At that time he also rejected calls for allowing political
parties other than the ruling Communist Party, although he left
open the possibility the constitution might eventually be changed
to permit a multiparty system.
   Tass quoted him as saying there was ``no other political force
capable of both renewing the bodies of Soviet power that were
gaining strength and consolidating society.''

<HEAD>Traders Association Predicts Worst Trade Deficit in Nine Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korea will run a trade deficit
of $3.3 billion this year, the worst in nine years, the Korea
Foreign Trade Association predicted Tuesday.
   The figure compared with a government projected deficit of $2
billion. Both figures were on a customs clearance basis.
   The national traders group expected $66.3 billion in exports
this year, up 6.4 percent from $62.3 billion in 1989, while
predicting $69.6 billion in imports, up 13.5 percent from $61.3
billion in 1989.
   The government projected $66 billion in exports and $68 billion
in imports for 1990.
   Association officials said exports are expected to recover
somewhat in the second quarter of this year but the growth is
likely to be far outpaced by surging imports.
   After years of substantial trade deficits, Korea scored its
first annual trade surplus in 1986, amounting to $3.1 billion.
   The country's trade surplus rose to a record $8.8 billion in
1988 but plunged to $1 billion in 1989 because of the loss of
export competitiveness, affected by the Korean currency's
appreciation, steep wage hikes and labor unrest in the past three
years.
   The association said its projection was based on assumption that
the Korean currency will be devalued by 5.6 percent during this
year to 720 won to the dollar, accompanied by moderate wage hikes
and few labor disputes.
   The group called on the government to take substantial steps to
reinvigorate exports. The government so far has refused to take any
drastic measures on exchange rates and bank loan interest rates for
fear of high inflation and instead has called for structural reform
of Korean industries.

<HEAD>West Germany Will Make Offer on Monetary Union to East Germany</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The West German government will make an
official offer Tuesday to East Germany to form a monetary union of
the two countries, diplomats of the European Community said Monday.
   West German Finance Minister Theo Waigel revealed the move at a
meeting of finance ministers of the European Community, the
12-nation trading bloc, according to officials.
   No details of the plan were released.
   East German Premier Hans Modrow was scheduled to travel to Bonn
to meet with West German officials on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   Community officials had anxiously awaited Waigel's remarks
because of concern about the effect of a monetary union of the two
Germanys on the rest of Western Europe, which is planning its own
monetary reform as part of its plans to remove trade barriers by
1992.
   A German monetary union no doubt would involve circulation of
West Germany's strong mark currency in the East.
   Communist East Germany has seen its centrally planned economy
deteriorate rapidly since the border between the two countries
opened late last year. Thousands of East Germans have poured into
their western neighbor.
   ``I fully understand Bonn's position ... to accelerate its
economic and monetary (union) with East Germany,'' said Dutch
Finance Minister Wim Kok. ``But Brussels must be the place where we
help determine Germany's position on that.''
   ``I have full confidence in the fact that German-German economic
and monetary integration will be firmly anchored in wider European
consultations,'' he told reporters. ``I find that crucial.''
   West Germany's economy, based on a free-market system, is the
most powerful in the European Community. Many of the West European
currencies are closely tied to the West German mark, and the EC
countries have been working on plans to form a common currency for
their members.
   Irish Finance Minister Albert Reynolds said Waigel ``indicated
the German government will make an offer to (East Germany) tomorrow
on closer integration for monetary union.'' Ireland currently holds
the community's rotating six-month presidency.
   He said Waigel promised to keep the community ``fully informed
of developments.''
   A diplomatic source, demanding anonymity, said Jacques Delors,
president of the community's executive body, raised questions about
how the German monetary union would affect the trading bloc's
monetary system.
   An internal report by the European Commission, the executive
body, said that immediate monetary union would create a strong
confidence factor. But it also cautioned that a quick marriage
would ``irrevocably'' link West Germany to East Germany.
   ``Any turbulences and setbacks in (East Germany) would be
transmitted to the (West German) economy and thereby also to the
community,'' said the study.
   ``These turbulences and frictions seem, however, almost
unavoidable,'' it said. ``It should not be forgotten that almost
the whole (East German) population has had no direct experience
with democracy and a market economy.''
   Waigel told German reporters that he delivered a message to the
finance ministers from West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who said
his country remains committed to the community's campaign to form
an economic and monetary union.
   Kohl also said the Bonn government would discuss its unity plans
with all community institutions.
   Waigel said no date was mentioned for a German monetary union
because it depended on discussions this week with Modrow and the
outcome of the March 18 elections in East Germany.
   He also noted the East German economy is one-tenth the size of
West Germany's. ``The dimension of the integration issue should not
be exaggerated,'' he said.
   ``I tried to convince my colleagues that the challenge can be
met by West Germany if one takes a mid-term view, that is, from
five to 10 years,'' he told reporters.
