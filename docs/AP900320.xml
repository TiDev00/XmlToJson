<HEAD>Spring Arrives But Northeast Blanketed By Snow</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 3rd graf, `In upstate ...,' to UPDATE with number of

   Spring began Tuesday, but it looked more like winter in the
Northeast and the Appalachian Mountains as up to 22 inches of snow
fell, causing power outages and closing sections of an interstate.
   Snow fell on eastern Ohio, much of New York state, nearly all of
Pennsylvania, Vermont, southern New Hampshire, the Maryland
Panhandle, eastern West Virginia and Virginia. Rain fell on the
coast.
   In upstate New York, 11 elementary school students were injured
when their bus rolled over on a rural road in poor weather in
Columbia County, said Trooper Don Bailey. A 6-year-old girl was
hospitalized in serious condition with a ruptured spleen, officials
said.
   Vermont got the heaviest snow, with 18 inches at Braintree by
mid-afternoon, 14 inches at Randolph Center and 19 at Williamstown.
The Killington Ski Area reported 22 inches of snow by late
afternoon and hoped for an additional 10 inches by morning.
   The heavy, wet snow clung to power lines, weighing them down and
causing power outages across the state.
   About 6,000 Vermonters were without power in the southern
section of the state and some would not have electricity throughout
the night, said Chuck Satterfield of the Central Vermont Public
Service Corp., which supplies more than half the state.
   The Vermont Highway Department closed sections of Interstate 89
for a time between Montpelier and Barre because of treacherous
conditions, said highway dispatcher Ray Burke. He said part of
Interstate 91 south near Thetford was closed by a weather-related
rock slide.
   ``The funniest thing I've seen today,'' Burke quipped, ``is a
robin with snowshoes, digging for worms on the Statehouse lawn.''
   Vermont state government offices in Montpelier shut down at 3
p.m., shortly after National Life of Vermont insurance company, one
of the area's largest employers, sent its workers home.
   In Pennsylvania, 6 to 7 inches fell at higher elevations near
Wellsboro, with 6 inches in northern Bradford County. Up to 10
inches fell on hilltop areas of New York's Delaware County. Up to 8
inches fell at higher elevations of Virginia's Shenandoah Valley.
   Syracuse, N.Y., had 5.2 inches of snow by 8 p.m., giving it a
total of 147.1 inches this winter, the third snowiest on record for
the central New York state.
   ``It is not a freak snowstorm. Late-season snowstorms are not
that uncommon,'' said Virginia state climatologist Pat Michaels.
   About 1,200 Virginia Power customers north and west of
Charlottesville were without power for several hours because more
than 50 fsnow-laden trees had fallen on power lines, said Virginia
Power spokeswoman Claire Gillespie.
   Several weather-related traffic wrecks, including a 15-car
pileup, and school delays and closings were reported in North
Carolina, which had snow in the mountains and freezing rain
elsewhere.
   Heavier snowfall in the six hours ending at noon included 7
inches in Montpelier, Vt., 3 inches in Williamsport, Pa., and 2
inches in Syracuse, N.Y., and the Wilkes Barre-Scranton, Pa., area.
   Freeze warnings were posted overnight for much of Georgia,
interior South Carolina, the interior of North Carolina, central
and western Virginia, West Virginia's Eastern Panhandle and western
through central Maryland.
   The cold threatened many trees and other plants that have
started spring growth early because of recent unseasonably warm
weather.
   ``It looks crazy, stuff in bloom with snow all over it'' said
Henry Chiles, owner of Crown Orchard in Batesville, Va. He said his
orchard workers planned to use blowers during the night to protect
apple, peach and nectarine trees.
   Rain fell over eastern Maryland, New Jersey, southeastern
Pennsylvania, eastern New York and southern New England.
   In the West, warmer weather was making a resurgence. Casper,
Wyo., had a record high of 63 degrees and Tucson, Ariz., posted a
record high of 62.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 24 at
Bradford, Pa., to 94 at Palm Springs, Calif.
   Tuesday's low for the Lower 48 states was 8 at Marquette, Mich.

<HEAD>Pro-Western Afghan Rebels Protest Distribution of US Aid</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pro-Western Afghan rebels say they are in
grave need of U.S. weapons and food, and they have attracted
backers in Congress.
   ``We're very desperate,'' said Mohamad Saljuqi of the National
Islamic Front of Afghanistan, or NIFA, a moderate Sunni faction
among the coalition of mujahedeen rebels. ``I don't know how long
we can go on.''
   Saljuqi's comments in a telephone interview Monday from Tehran,
Iran, came as U.S. and Soviet diplomats prepare to discuss the
stalemated war in Afghanistan. They will explore a possible
political solution to remove the Soviet-installed Kabul government
from power during a meeting in Helsinki, Finland, on Wednesday.
   Saljuqi's complaint highlights the growing controversy over the
10-year U.S. aid program to the mujahedeen. Support in Congress has
been eroding following the Soviet military pullout from Afghanistan
last year.
   While conservatives believe the United States should increase
supervision of its aid and make sure it gets to the right groups,
liberals advocate a U.S. cutoff of aid for the rebels coupled with
an end to Soviet aid for the Afghan government.
   Robert Peck, until June 1989 the Bush administration's top
analyst on Afghanistan, said in recent congressional testimony that
the United States had become entangled in factional fighting among
the mujahedeen and should disengage.
   Other experts say Pakistan's secret service, which is in charge
of distributing U.S. weapons to the guerrillas, discriminates
against NIFA and other pro-Western factions in favor of
fundamentalist Moslem groups.
   Saljuqi said NIFA guerrillas have not received any ammunition or
other supplies from the United States since last summer. The State
Department rejects the complaint, saying each of the seven
mujahedeen groups receives what it should.
   But some members of Congress are championing NIFA's cause. In
two recent letters to President Bush, a group of lawmakers led by
Rep. Don Ritter, R-Pa., urged the administration to investigate.
   In response to the lawmakers' first letter, national security
adviser Brent Scowcroft wrote in December that the allegations of
discrimination against certain factions had been investigated and
``to the extent they existed, (were) corrected.''
   The lawmakers disagreed. The ``picture we are receiving from
official U.S. government channels ... appears to be different than
the many reliable reports, fresh from the field, that are coming
from important segments of the Afghan resistance,'' they wrote back.
   They urged an end to the Pakistanis' control over the weapons
``and an equitable distribution of military supplies to the most
strategic, combat-effective and moderate elements of the Afghan
resistance.''
   Saljuqi said that in order to break the stalemate in the
fighting against the Kabul government, his guerrillas need
ammunition, mortar shells and shoulder-fired, Stinger anti-aircraft
missiles.
   Administration officials say they prefer to look for a political
solution to the stalemate.
   Barnett Rubin, an Afghanistan specialist at the congressionally
funded U.S. Institute of Peace, said NIFA has been getting a bad
deal both from the Pakistanis and the Saudis. He said Saudi Arabia,
which provides about two-thirds of the estimated $700 million the
mujahedeen got last year, does not like NIFA because the Saudis
believe it is too close to Iran _ the Saudis' archenemy.
   The situation is further complicated by the continued suspension
of U.S. food aid to NIFA and other guerrillas in western
Afghanistan. U.S. officials said Monday they are still trying to
reach agreement with the rebel leaders on an effective monitoring
system for the program, which last year provided about $33 million
worth of food.
   The program, administered by the Agency for International
Development, was suspended last November and resumed once in
January, only to be stopped again last month, the officials said.
   The United States is concerned that without effective
monitoring, the food _ mostly sacks of wheat _ could be diverted by
rebel leaders and sold for profit.

   If Japan has a national obsession, it's the cherry
blossom.
   During the first days of spring, when the cool of winter still
envelops much of the nation, the coming of the ``pink mist'' is
impatiently awaited.
   Its progress up the archipelago from subtropical Okinawa to
snowy Hokkaido is closely watched.
   When the cherry trees bloom, millions of Japanese, young and
old, head to the parks to practice the ancient art of
``flower-viewing,'' a spirited mixture of song, sake and, with
luck, sunshine.
   Many companies arrange large, and sometimes lavish, outdoor
parties for their employees. Stalls in the parks sell tasty treats
_ from squid-on-a-stick to cotton candy.
   Since the cherry blossom's beauty is a fleeting pleasure,
lasting only a few days, careful attention to weather trends is
required to catch them in their full splendor.
   This year's official announcement came today: the state
Meteorological Agency declared that the wait this year should be
shorter than usual.
   Flower viewers, said one agency official, may even be able to
savor their rice wine before April Fool's Day.
   ``Several cherries are already in bloom because the weather has
been relatively warm,'' he said, requesting anonymity. ``In fact,
this year is tied with 1989 and 1966 as the earliest for blossoms.''
   Rumors to that effect had been circulating for quite some time.
   Evening television news broadcasts already have begun their
periodic updates on the ``sakura zensen,'' or cherry blossom front
line, giving special attention to those harbingers of spring that
burst into bloom earlier than the rest.
   Signs have been posted at rest areas along the nation's highways
informing motorists of when to expect the local blossoms to be at
their peak, and the public Japan Highway Corp. has set up a hotline
for cherry information.
   Some 150,000 cherry trees grace the 100 or so service areas
nationwide, said Motoki Mori, a corporation spokesman.
   ``The Japanese have a very strong fondness for the cherry
blossom,'' he said. ``It's just something about our national
character.''
   Mori said the ``front line'' was still down in the southwestern
island of Kyushu, but probably would hit Tokyo suddenly.
   Police, meanwhile, geared up for the onslaught of picnickers on
Japan's normally sedate parks. The heaviest-hit is likely to be
Tokyo's Ueno Park, where 450,000 people _ or 505 people per tree _
viewed the blossoms on a sunny April 2, 1989.
   A park official said flower viewers already had begun setting up
for picnics today, though only a few trees had blossomed.

<HEAD>Educator: Draft College Grads as Teachers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For a man whose animated classroom lectures
include leaping onto desktops, it's no wonder that Rice University
Professor Dennis Huston offers an unorthodox solution to an
impending teacher shortage.
   ``I think that the answer is some kind of system for drafting
young people just out of college who are in the process of deciding
what they want to do,'' said Huston, an English professor at the
Houston university who was named national ``professor of the year''
by an education group.
   Huston shared his ideas during an interview after meeting with
President Bush earlier this year.
   ``We need to put a lot of these kids into the high schools and
let them teach for one or two years as a kind of service to the
country,'' said Huston.
   The Education Department predicted the annual demand for new
public school teachers will rise from 128,000 in 1988 to 174,000 in
1995. But only 8.8 percent of the 1988 first-year college students
plan to pursue careers in elementary or secondary education.
   Linda Darling-Hammond, professor of education at the Teachers
College of Columbia University, said only about three-fourths of
those who prepare to teach actually enter teaching after
graduation. Of those who do enter, about half leave during their
first five years, she said.
   To get more teachers into the classroom, Huston said new college
graduates should be selected in a military-type draft or
``encouraged through propaganda like we once did for the Peace
Corps.'' They would teach their college major solely as a service
to the country, he said.
   ``If President Bush emphasized how important (the draft program)
was to the nation,'' it would work because ``lots of students feel
a missionary zeal,'' Huston said.
   The new graduates would be trained in a special program that is
``only a few weeks long because that's all you need when you know
the subject matter,'' said Huston, who joined the Rice faculty in
1969.
   He said his teacher draft idea would provide ``really qualified
inexpensive labor'' to schools.
   ``The president is fond of talking about wars on drugs, wars on
this ... This is a place where we need a draft of a different group
of people ... the people who have profited the most from their
upbringing either by their own initiative or by the fact that they
were fortunate enough to come out of a successful family,'' said
Huston.
   ``Those people owe this society. They owe this country the most.
Seems to me the least we can expect of them is two years of service
in a much more important cause right now than war _ the cause of
education. And it is, of course, finally in the end self-serving.''
   The recruits ``would have the energy and optimism of youth and
the knowledge of a wonderful education to convey to students in
high school,'' said Huston. And, he added, classroom size could be
reduced ``because we'd suddenly have a lot more teachers.''
   The professor of the year program is sponsored by the Council
for Advancement and Support of Education, the nation's largest
education association in terms of institutional membership,
including about 2,850 colleges, universities, and independent
schools.
   Huston won the title from 500 nominations nationwide. He
received a $5,000 cash award sponsored by the Carnegie Foundation
for the Advancement of Teaching.
   The council launched the competition in 1981 to recognize
undergraduate faculty members for their contributions to the lives
and careers of students. Since its inception, eight other national
professors of the year and more than 160 finalists have been
honored.

<HEAD>Administration Asks Congress for Aviation Tax Hikes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is asking Congress to
raise taxes on aviation fuel and airline tickets and allow a new
airport tax as part of a five-year plan for commercial aviation.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner included the $22 billion
proposal in the Federal Aviation Administration's reauthorization
bill sent to Congress on Monday.
   The plan would add up to $12 in airport fees to a roundtrip
airline ticket, increase the tax on tickets from 8 percent to 10
percent and hike aviation fuel taxes by 25 percent, which also
likely would be passed along in higher fares. Congress is likely to
make modifications, however.
   It is the first proposal arising out of the administration's new
national transportation policy, which calls for travelers to
finance a greater share of national transportation systems.
   The administration makes a distinction between ``user fees'' and
taxes, which President Bush has promised not to increase. Skinner
acknowledged last week, however, that transportation budget
proposals include boosts in both local and federal levies.
   The increases would add to an aviation trust fund that the FAA
proposes to tap for 85 percent of aeronautical needs through fiscal
1995. Currently, 57 percent of federal aviation costs are covered
by users via the tax-fed trust fund, with the remainder from
general tax revenue.
   FAA Administrator James B. Busey said the reauthorization bill
would help meet the growing demand for aviation, allow
modernization of the air traffic control system and increase
aviation safety.
   Overall, it would boost federal funding for aviation projects by
73 percent in the next five years, Busey said.
   In addition to the plan for improvements, the FAA expects to
spend between $22 billion and $24 billion on operations and
maintenance over the next five years, including salaries of air
traffic controllers, agency budget officials said.
   ``I believe this administration has put forward a comprehensive
proposal to deal with aviation in the 1990s,'' Busey told a meeting
of airport officials.
   If approved by Congress, the plan would allow airports to impose
taxes for the first time since the early 1970s.
   The maximum initial tax would be $3 per departure, with
travelers who make connecting flights paying at no more than one
additional airport each way. The legislation would give the
transportation secretary power to increase the maximum tax after
fiscal 1991.
   After the first year, collection of the tax would automatically
decrease other federal funding available to airports. Some smaller
regional airports might elect not to levy the fee, so it would not
reduce funding under the federal Airport Improvement Program, said
Mike Moffet, an FAA assistant administrator.
   Each $1 collected in departure taxes would reduce federal funds
available to an airport by 50 cents. Improvement funds that were
freed as a result of the new tax revenues would go into a
discretionary fund to help airports that need additional money,
Moffet said.
   If the nation's largest 45 airports imposed the ticket tax,
collections would total an estimated $1 billion a year, he said.
The collections could be used to obtain bonds for about $10 billion
in airport projects over the five years.
   Federal support for airport improvements would total $7.7
billion over five years, a 28 percent increase over amounts made
available during the past five years.
   Other funds under the reauthorization program would include
$13.5 billion for facilities and equipment programs, a 130 percent
increase over the previous five years; and $970 million for
research and development, a 13 percent increase.
   The aviation trust fund is expected to have a $7.6 billion
balance by the end of fiscal 1990 on Sept. 30. The spending plan
would decrease the fund to about $3 billion by the end of the
five-year period, officials said.

   A woman who once claimed David
Letterman was a dominant figure in her life has broken into the
talk-show host's home twice since she was released from prison for
one of five earlier break-ins there, police said.
   Margaret Ray, 37, of Crawford, Colo., was released Friday from
Niantic State Prison for women, and on Sunday, police found her in
Letterman's house after he called to report a broken window, police
Sgt. Nick Warren said.
   Police escorted her off the property and warned her not to come
back, Warren said.
   But early Monday, the host of NBC's ``Late Night with David
Letterman'' called police to report seeing Ray in the hallway of
his home. Police found her near the tennis court on Letterman's
property.
   Ray was charged with first-degree trespassing, held overnight on
$1,000 bond and taken to Norwalk Superior Court on Monday
afternoon, where a psychiatric evaluation was ordered, a
spokeswoman in the public defender's office said. Ray was taken
back to the Niantic prison.
   When Ray was released last Friday, she had served seven months
of a nine-month sentence for trespassing at Letterman's home last
August.
   An NBC publicist, Rosemary Keenan, said Letterman had no comment
on the arrest.

   Indianapolis Colts star Eric Dickerson, the
seventh-leading rusher in National Football League history, says he
has lost interest in football, and intends to retire.
   ``I'm through with football, and (the Colts) know it. So I'm
telling you, I'm finished,'' Dickerson, 29, said in an interview
taped Thursday at his Lost Angeles home and broadcast Monday on on
WFYI-TV's ``Indiana Tonight'' show.
   ``Right now I really don't love the game that much,'' Dickerson
said. ``But rather than stay in Indianapolis and take the pounding
that I'm taking, I'd rather quit.''
   Jim Irsay, the Colts general manager and son of owner Robert
Irsay, said through a spokesman on Monday that the team expected
Dickerson to fulfill his contract obligations. Team spokesman Craig
Kelley declined to say what Dickerson's obligations are.
   Dickerson came to the Colts in October 1987 in a trade from the
Los Angeles Rams. He has gained 11,226 yards, 10 behind O.J.
Simpson, and has rushed for more than 1,000 yards in each of his
seven NFL seasons. He holds the single-season record of 2,105
yards, set with the Rams in 1984.

   Filmmaker Robert Hendrickson, suing talk show
host Geraldo Rivera for alleged copyright infringement, lost a bid
to subpoena mass murderer Charles Manson to testify.
   Hendrickson contends that Manson is the only available witness
who can testify about his 1972 documentary ``Manson,'' parts of
which the filmmaker claims Rivera used without permission.
   In a ruling released Monday, U.S. District Judge Ronald S.W. Lew
declined to subpoena Manson, 55, who is in state prison in
Corcoran, 190 miles north of Los Angeles. Lew said Hendrickson
cited no authority empowering the court to issue the subpoena.
   Hendrickson, 45, of Woodland Hills, filed the copyright
infringement suit in May, a month after Rivera aired excerpts from
``Manson'' in the TV special, ``Murder _ Live from Death Row.''
   The trial is set for April 10.
   Manson was convicted in 1969 of masterminding the murder of
actress Sharon Tate and six others.

<HEAD>Study: Quickly Administering Clot Drug Stops Heart Attacks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Speedier injections of clot-busting drugs to
heart attack victims improves their chances of escaping permanent
damage, suggesting that ambulance crews can save lives by
administering this medicine on the way to the hospital, a study
concludes.
   Even when hospitals are prepared to offer this treatment, hours
may pass before patients reach the emergency ward, are evaluated by
heart specialists and eventually hooked up to lines that drip the
medicine into their bloodstreams.
   The new research supports the growing belief that for this
approach to work well, it must be offered fast, perhaps even before
heart attack victims leave their homes.
   The research found that 92 percent of clogged arteries could be
reopened if the medicine was given immediately as a shot. Currently
hospitals administer the medicine as a continuous drip infusion,
which takes longer to set up and is impractical for use by
paramedics.
   In past studies, clot-dissolving drugs have been about 60
percent to 70 percent effective in opening up clot-blocked heart
arteries.
   The new study, meant to simulate ambulance administration of the
drug tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, was conducted by Dr.
George R. McKendall of Rhode Island Hospital. He presented the
findings Monday at a meeting of the American College of Cardiology.
   ``They achieved what appears to be a startling patency,'' or
reopening of closed arteries, of more than 90 percent, said Dr.
Carl J. Pepine of the University of Florida. ``This is striking.''
   McKendall said that ambulance crews in Providence will begin
carrying TPA within a few weeks. Emergency teams in at least seven
other cities are already doing this or planning similar programs.
   Dr. C. Richard Conti, president of the college of cardiology,
said that in light of the lastest research, ``we ought to think
about giving the first dose in the home by paramedics.''
   In the latest study, patients with heart attacks were given an
injection of TPA as soon as they arrived at the hospital. Doctors
waited a half hour to mimic an ambulance trip and then set them up
on a continuous drip to deliver the rest of a standard dose of TPA.
   ``We wanted to see what happens if you give a quick shot and
then take the patient to the hospital,'' McKendall said. ``It
suggests that this may be a more effective way of achieving
patency.''
   Heart attacks usually occur when an obstruction, typically a
blood clot, gets stuck in an artery that feeds the heart muscle.
Unless the blockage is removed within a few hours, a section of
muscle is starved of oxygen and dies, permanently weakening the
heart.
   While TPA and similar drugs are effective, they also are risky
because they can cause uncontrolled bleeding. If the bleeding
occurs in the brain, the result can be a crippling stroke.
   To make sure that during emergencies the medicines are given
only to people who truly are having heart attacks, the ambulance
crew typically sends electrocardiogram readings back to the
hospital over a cellular telephone. A doctor there gives
instructions about what medicines to administer.
   Several clot-dissolving drugs are now on the market, and others
are being tested. Many studies are under way to determine which is
the best.
   In the United States, many physicians consider TPA to be the
preferred drug. This medicine, produced through genetic
engineering, costs a hospital about $2,300 for a single dose. A
competing drug, streptokinase, which is made from bacteria, costs
$87.
   A recent Italian study concluded that the far cheaper
stroptokinase works just as well as TPA. However, another new
study, also presented at the meeting Monday, suggests that a
combination of the two may be the best approach.
   Dr. Cindy L. Grines of the University of Kentucky compared the
combination with straight TPA in 111 heart attack patients. She
found that clogged arteries reopened in 70 percent of those who got
the combination, combined with 58 percent in those getting TPA
alone.
   She said that the combination approach costs only about half as
much as pure TPA and appears to work better.

   A Vietnamese court has sentenced to 20
years in prison the head of a group that helped hundreds of boat
people flee the Communist country, Hanoi Radio reported.
   It said other group members were also sent to prison, including
one sentenced to 18 years.
   From 1984 to March 1989, Phan Van Thanh organized 19 illegal
departures from Vietnam involving about 1,000 people, the Sunday
radio report said. These included one trip in October 1988 in which
one boat sank and 16 people died, said the report, which was
monitored in Bangkok on Monday.
   Thanh and his group, which operated in Ho Chi Minh City
(formerly Saigon), collected fees in gold from the families of
escapees once their safe arrival was confirmed by mail, the report
said.
   It said an accomplice, Tran Van Chi, bribed an Interior Ministry
official and also ``pressured '' security forces into releasing
another group member in 1988.
   Though Thanh surrendered to authorities at the beginning of
1988, he then ``abused his acquaintance with a number of leading
cadres (Communist party officials) to organize additional trips on
a larger scale,'' the radio said.
   He was sentenced on March 11, the report said.
   Tran Van Chi received a sentence of 18 years, the radio said.
   Jail terms of other group members ranged from three to 12 years,
the report said. The radio said Thanh had 13 accomplices, but it
did not say if they were all sentenced.

<HEAD>Republicans Say Democrats Too Hasty in Considering Child Care Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Republicans are accusing Democrats of
rushing to the floor for a quick vote this week on a tentative
compromise over competing versions of new child-care legislation.
   ``They've gone behind closed doors, they've cut their deals,''
Rep. Bob Walker, R-Pa., charged Monday. ``Now they're ready to rush
it to the floor.''
   The child-care legislation, which has been stalled for months
because of differences among Democrats, was the object of weeks of
private negotiations that were continuing today.
   Democratic leaders, who control the House agenda, scheduled the
bill for floor debate Wednesday and Thursday.
   But Rep. David Nagle, D-Iowa, one of the sponsors, told the
House on Monday that not all issues had been resolved and that
Democrats didn't have copies of the bill either.
   Democratic leaders hoped to work out details of their bill in
time to seek a special rule from the Rules Committee today limiting
floor amendments. Opponents wanted no limit.
   The tentative version worked out among Democratic leaders would
combine elements of competing child-care proposals. It would expand
tax credits for low-income families and increase funding for block
grants under Title XX of the Social Security Act, as well as expand
Head Start and create a school-based program for before- and
after-school care.
   It would drop a proposed new program of grants to the states to
subsidize child care, which had been pushed by liberals including
Rep. Gus Hawkins, D-Calif., chairman of the House Education and
Labor Committee.
   The compromise was expected to face challenges on the House
floor, however, from some Republicans and conservative Democrats.
   Total cost of the Democrats' version has been estimated at as
much as $5 billion a year.
   Nagle said Democrats were seeking resolution of final
differences over how to provide financial aid to religious
institutions that provide child care.
   Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia predicted that
President Bush would veto the Democrats' plan if it wins passage.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., has promised floor action
and has long said he hoped for a vote by the end of March. His
deadline put pressure on Democrats to resolve their differences or
risk losing entirely on the floor.

<HEAD>Forecasters Fairly Optimistic About '90 Farm Outlook</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With today's arrival of spring and the
observance of National Agriculture Day, it's also time for some
serious economic forecasting.
   Just in time, the Agriculture Department's seers have unveiled a
new set of numbers for the nation's farmers in 1990. Generally,
things are looking pretty good.
   Not everything will be rosy, but USDA's latest economic outlook
made it a lot easier for President Bush, Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter and other leaders to smile as they pay tribute to
the nation's farmers at a scheduled White House ceremony today.
   The picture is subject to change, of course. There's always the
possibility of unexpected catastrophe when crops and livestock are
involved.
   ``Combined with continuing strong demand for agricultural
products, currently higher prices due to tighter corn stocks and
smaller hog inventories have brightened the outlook,'' the outlook
report said.
   The report, a digest of one to be issued later in USDA's
Agricultural Outlook magazine, also had some encouraging news for
consumers this spring.
   ``Increasing poultry supplies may push retail prices below last
summer, giving consumers relief from rising pork prices,'' it said.
``Retail beef prices likely will remain near last year's highs
through the second and third quarters. Milk and egg prices probably
will decline in 1990 as recent favorable returns stimulate
production.''
   Analysts also said the bulk of federal payments _ which figure
prominently in annual farm income statistics _ continue to go to a
relative handful of larger farming operations.
   Overall, the ``net cash income'' of farmers was forecast at $54
billion to $58 billion this year, up from $53 billion in 1989 but
likely below the record of $57.2 billion in 1988. Previously,
USDA's Economic Research Service had put 1990 income in the range
of $52 billion to $57 billion.
   As used by the agency, net cash income ``measures the value of
commodities sold in a calendar year plus government payments, less
out-of-pocket costs.'' Commodities sold may actually have been
produced in earlier years and stored until marketed.
   In another method of accounting, the report said ``net farm
income'' is expected to be in the range of $45 billion to $49
billion, steady to down 8 percent from last year's $49 billion.
Previously, it was forecast at $44 billion to $49 billion.
   Economists use net farm income to measure the value of
agricultural production _ whether sold or stored _ in a calendar
year plus government payments, minus all costs, including
depreciation and other factors.
   ``Net farm income may drop as feed grain prices ease from the
spikes caused by the 1988 drought,'' the report said. ``The lower
prices will dampen the value of the fall harvest. Much of the fall
1990 harvest will be sold in 1991.''
   The report said an analysis of USDA's 1988 Farm Costs and
Returns Survey showed that direct payments to farmers have been
``distributed on the basis of production'' as prescribed by current
farm law.
   ``Of farms receiving direct government payments, 32 percent
received 90 percent of the payments,'' the report said. ``Since 64
percent of all farm receive no direct payments, 90 percent of the
payments go to only 12 percent of all farms.''
   Greg Gajewski, senior editor of the report, said there was ``no
surprise'' in the breakdown of federal subsidies and that the
pattern fit the trend.
   Direct federal payments to farmers peaked at about $16.7 billion
in 1987, according to the study, then dropped to $14.5 billion in
1988 and to around $11 million in 1989 as market prices improved,
thus reducing many of the subsidy rates. A further reduction to as
low as $8 billion is expected this year.
   The report also said that ``improved weather has brightened
prospects'' for the U.S. winter wheat crop.
   ``Early indicators in Western Europe, Canada and Australia point
to wheat production gains there as well,'' it said. ``Wheat prices
are falling.''
   In Asia, a bumper 1989-90 rice crop is being harvested, with
record or near-record output forecast for China, Bangladesh,
Vietnam, Thailand and India.
   ``But U.S. stocks are low, and the Thais are holding stocks back
for sale later in the year,'' the report added. ``So, prices remain
strong and U.S. exports are slowing.''

<HEAD>Rowny Pushes Strategic Defense Program</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. anti-missile program ``is destined to
play a major role'' in preventing a nuclear war even as the
superpowers prepare to slash their weapons arsenals, a senior
presidential adviser said today.
   The Strategic Defense Initiative, known popularly as Star Wars,
has been under attack by arms control experts as farfetched ever
since it was unveiled by former President Reagan.
   But Edward L. Rowny, a retired Army general who advised Reagan
and now President Bush on arms control, challenged those critics as
``wizards of Armageddon.''
   In a speech prepared for a defense association, Rowny said the
critics foolishly rely on an outmoded approach to deter Soviet
nuclear attack.
   That doctrine, known as MAD, for mutually assured destruction,
is based on the theory that a potential aggressor would not launch
a first strike if its lack of a defense exposed itself to massive
retaliation.
   Rowny said the technology of SDI offers a better guarantee
against Soviet or accidental nuclear attack. It would use nuclear
weapons and other advanced technology to intercept and destroy
ballistic missiles aimed at the United States.
   Bush is asking Congress to boost research spending on SDI by $1
billion beginning in October to $4.1 billion.
   In the meantime, the United States and the Soviet Union are
moving closer to treaties to reduce their long-range nuclear
weapons and their arsenals of tanks and other conventional arms in
Europe.
   Rowny said a strategic defense gradually becomes more critical
as these weapons are scaled down. He called SDI an insurance policy
for a treaty to cut long-range missiles by 30 to 50 percent.
   ``With SDI,'' he said, ``a fateful Soviet decision to initiate a
first strike, for whatever reason, will almost certainly never be
made. Should deterrence fail, though, strategic defense will help
protect our society.''
   U.S.-Soviet negotiations in Geneva on strategic defenses have
not kept pace with progress in other arms control areas.
   In fact, Rowny said, the Soviets were using the negotiations to
try to block the U.S. program.
   He said the Bush administration had proposed that both sides
have a strategic defense. After signing a treaty, they would have
three years to decide whether to deploy systems that are not
permitted under the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.
   Rowny was speaking to the American Defense Preparedness
Association.

<HEAD>10,000 Oil Spills Since Exxon Valdez Accident</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millions of gallons of oil will be spilled on
land and water year after year unless the United States changes its
approach to oil, says the Wilderness Society in a report called
``100 Spills, 1,000 Excuses.''
   The report released Monday details the 100 worst spills since
the Exxon Valdez accident broke all records when the tanker ran
aground March 24, 1989, dumping 11 million gallons of crude oil
into Prince William Sound, Alaska.
   ``The sad fact is that while the past 12 months have featured a
number of large and widely publicized spills, this has been, in
most respects, a typical year,'' said George Frampton, president of
the society.
   ``No one has final figures, but experts estimate that there have
been roughly 10,000 spills since the Exxon Valdez tore open,'' said
the report. Those spills have caused the loss of 15 million to 20
million gallons of oil, it said.
   The past year's spills include three in one weekend in June when
a Liberian tanker left a 20-foot by 2-mile sheen in Delaware Bay,
Del.; an Amoco pipeline spilled 96,000 gallons of gasoline at Knox
County, Ill., and 34,700 gallons of diesel fuel were dumped from a
pipeline near Newtown, N.D.
   On New Year's Day an Exxon refinery pipeline ruptured, sending
567,000 gallons of heating oil into the Arthur Kill Waterway near
Linden, N.J. On Feb. 7, a tanker ran into its own anchor and spewed
397,000 gallons of crude into the waters of Huntington Beach, Calif.
   The Wilderness Society said the report is based on its own
records and those of the Coast Guard, the Alaska Department of
Conservation, the National Park Service, the U.S. Bureau of Land
Management and World Information Systems of Cambridge, Mass.
   ``Oil is inherently messy business. Accidents, lots of accidents
will happen,'' said the report.
   It said there should be stronger incentives for oil and shipping
industries to extract, transport and refine oil more safely;
stepped up government enforcement of laws relating to oil
production and the environment; and an end to U.S. ``addiction'' to
oil.
   Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., chairman of the House Interior
subcommittee on water and power resources, starts hearings Thursday
to continue Congress' investigation of the Exxon Valdez spill's
impact.
   Miller said the hearing will consider the extent of oil
pollution in Alaska due to the Valdez, future cleanup options and
whether industry can handle another spill of the same magnitude.
   Miller plans another hearing next week to look into
environmental problems associated with operation of the
trans-Alaska pipeline, including corrosion of the pipeline.
   Congress is working on a liability bill that will determine who
should pay for future spills. The legislation, now in a
House-Senate conference committee, also would establish regulations
for handling oil.
   The most hotly contested issue is a House proposal to require
all tankers calling on U.S. ports to have double bottoms within
seven years and double hulls within 15 years. All new tankers would
have to be built with double hulls.
   Senate conference committee members want new tankers and barges
to have double hulls or any alternative that the National Academy
of Sciences decides would provide protection.
   They also have proposed a phaseout of the existing single-hull
tanker and barge fleet. About one-fifteenth of the fleet would be
retired each year, with the oldest and largest going first.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan should keep up his aggressive anti-smoking campaign and
``get even tougher,'' seven of his predecessors agree.
   Sullivan met in private Monday with the seven former secretaries
of HHS and its predecessor agency, the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare, for a wide-ranging discussion.
   The former officials later were joined by Vice President Dan
Quayle for an unveiling of former HHS Secretary Otis Bowen's
official portrait.
   Sullivan said after the ceremony the discussion with his
predecessors was ``very meaningful, very helpful.''
   ``We talked about some of our current priorities, such as health
care reform and programs to strengthen the family, and how former
secretaries dealt with moving their agendas,'' he said.
   Joseph Califano Jr., who headed HEW from 1977-79, and Margaret
Heckler, HHS secretary from 1983-85, said the former officials
uniformly supported Sullivan's campaign against smoking and tobacco
company advertising practices.
   Califano, the only Democrat among them, said they agreed ``that
he ought to keep going and get even tougher.''
   ``We gave him quite a lot of advice,'' Heckler said. ``In
general, we like the course he's plotted. ... We also feel he can
do a great deal more simply because he's captured the attention of
the American people on the smoking issue and its relationship to
minorities and women.''
   Sullivan said he intends to use the smoking issue as a platform
to emphasize the importance of health promotion and disease
prevention.
   The other former secretaries at the meeting were: Bowen,
1985-89; Richard Schweiker, 1981-83; David Mathews, 1975-77; Robert
Finch, 1969-70; and Arthur S. Flemming, 1958-61.
   HEW was broken up into the Department of Health and Human
Services and the Department of Education in May 1980.
   Bowen's portrait will be hung in the Great Hall of the Hubert H.
Humphrey Building, along with those of the other former secretaries
of HHS and HEW.
   Bowen, a physician and former Indiana governor, served as HHS
secretary from Dec. 13, 1985, to Jan. 20, 1989 _ the longest of
anyone in that position. He lives in Bremen, Ind., with his wife,
Rose, who also attended the ceremony.
   Quayle, a fellow Hoosier, said Bowen is ``a man of compassion,
man of integrity, a man committed to his family ... and all the
people of the nation.''
   Sullivan praised Bowen's work addressing the AIDS epidemic,
fighting illegal drugs and reforming the Medicare system with the
catastrophic illness program. Though Congress repealed it last
year, ``the discussion is far from over,'' Sullivan said.

   Despite predictions of more thefts like the $100
million-plus raid of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, many
museums and galleries have inexperienced, poorly paid guards and
inadequate security systems, experts say.
   To make matters worse, there are only a handful of investigators
trained to probe such crimes, officials said.
   Guards are considered the weakest link in the security chain.
Most are young and receive little better than the minimum wage to
protect million-dollar paintings and sculptures.
   ``We've got to begin to hire career security people,'' said
Steven Keller, a security consultant who was brought in to
supervise security at the Art Institute of Chicago after thieves
stole three Cezanne paintings in 1979.
   In Israel and some European countries, security guards are
typically highly-trained, well-paid professionals, Keller said.
   ``It's the exact opposite here. Security guards here are hired
at the entry-level and leave their jobs to work at McDonald's or
become janitors,'' Keller said.
   In the robbery early Sunday at the Gardner Museum, two men
dressed as police officers persuaded the two guards on duty to let
them into the museum, then bound them with tape and disabled the
security system.
   The thieves made off with a dozen artworks, including priceless
Old Master paintings, in the biggest theft in modern times since
the looting of Germany's national bank at the end of World War II.
   Several of the pictures and at least one Rembrandt were cut out
of their frames, which were connected to an alarm system.
   The pilfered works included two paintings and an etching by
Rembrandt, three paintings and two charcoals by Edgar Degas; one
painting each by Edouard Manet, Jan Vermeer and Govaert Flinck, and
a bronze beaker dating from the Chinese Shang Dynasty, 1,200-1,100
B.C.
   The thieves also tried but failed to take a third Rembrandt, a
self-portrait, said museum spokesman Barry Wanger. He would not
give details.
   Museum director Anne Hawley said the guards, who had worked at
the Gardner less than a year, were only doing their job and would
not be disciplined.
   Many museums have a lax attitude toward security, said Robert
Spiel, a private security consultant and former FBI agent
specializing in art theft.
   ``You're seeing a mentality where people assume that because an
artwork is either too obscure or too famous, no one will steal
it,'' Spiel said. ``That leads to a low level of security.''
   Curators and security experts said that as the value of art
soars at auction houses like Sotheby's, thefts are bound to
increase as the illegal art market grows to a billion-dollar
international trade.
   ``The average person thinks an art theft is an exotic thing that
happens once every few years,'' said Donald Mason, a private
security consultant for museums. ``That's just not so.''
   Mason, who headed art theft investigations for the FBI
nationwide from 1965 to 1976, said when he began he was the only
agent in the United States assigned to probe incidents of stolen
art.
   Eventually he assembled a squad of five agents to probe art
thefts, but the FBI has since disbanded the group.
   ``They said they wanted to concentrate on other things, like
white-collar and organized crime,'' Mason said. ``But a lot of art
investigations involve both of those.''
   Some improvements may be on the way. Keller, chairman of the
American Society of Industrial Security, said the security
professionals' association has spent the past two years drawing up
more than 100 guidelines on how to tighten museum security.
   The guidelines include such measures as tighter screening of
potential guards and making alarm systems immune to power failures,
Keller said.
   Compliance will not be mandatory, but pressure from insurance
companies will force most major museums to adopt the measures,
Keller predicted.
   Consultants agreed, however, that prevention of art theft will
probably continue to get a low priority.
   ``There's a perception that people who have art stolen can
afford it,'' Spiel said. ``But I think the public is the loser.''

   The 12 works taken from the Isabella Stewart
Gardner Museum in one of the biggest thefts in history were not
insured, and authorities were not optimistic the stolen
masterpieces would be recovered.
   ``The sad part is this may wind up in a vault somewhere.
Unfortunately, on valuable art objects, the track record (on
recovery) isn't really good,'' said FBI agent Dennis O'Callaghan.
   The FBI searched the world Monday for the ancient Chinese vase
and 11 paintings and drawings by artists such as Rembrandt, Degas
and Vermeer taken early Sunday from the museum.
   Police put the value of the missing paintings at a minimum of
$100 million. The museum said they were worth hundreds of millions
of dollars, and most art experts agreed. No exact value can be put
on the paintings because they have not been on the market for
nearly 100 years.
   Mrs. Gardner's collection of paintings, books, religious
artifacts, sculptures and rare books were only insured for
restoration and conservation, museum officials said. There was no
insurance for theft.
   ``The costs of such insurance would be prohibitive,'' said
museum spokesman Barry Wanger.``It would be more than the operating
budget of $2.8 million a year.''
   Futhermore, Mrs. Gardner's will bars the museum curators from
buying and installing replacements, he said. ``So if we lose a
painting by theft or another way, we can't buy another one.''
   The two thieves, dressed as policeman, talked their way into the
museum by telling the two security guards on duty there was a
disturbance in the area, police said. They bound the guards with
tape, and spent the next two hours removing the works.
   The crime was discovered when the morning cleaning crew arrived.
   The pilfered works included two paintings and an etching by
Rembrandt, three paintings and two charcoals by Edgar Degas; one
painting each by Edouard Manet, Jan Vermeer and Govaert Flinck, and
a bronze beaker dating from the Chinese Shang Dynasty, 1,200-1,100
B.C.
   O'Callaghan said no ransom demands had been received.
   He said he couldn't discuss any leads the FBI might have
uncovered.
   ``There are sources around the world we would reach out for'' in
the effort to recover the works, the agent said.
   The Gardner theft was exceeded only by the looting of Germany's
national bank at the end of World War II.
   The Guinness Book of World Records lists the looting of
Germany's national bank, the Reichsbank, in the spring of 1945 as
the most lucrative robbery in modern history, worth $3 billion in
contemporary dollars.
   Guinness also notes that the Philippines government has accused
former President Ferdinand Marcos and his wife, Imelda, of
pilfering $5 billion to $10 billion while in power.
   Probably the most celebrated art heist of all time was the 1911
theft of the Mona Lisa from the Louvre in Paris. It was recovered
in Italy in 1913. Because no price has ever been established for
the painting, the value of the theft has never been determined.
   In addition to a bid for ransom, speculation about the motive
for the crime includes a collector paying the thieves to steal what
the collector couldn't buy.
   The works are so famous they are worthless on the open market.
But authorities said it was urgent that the works be found quickly.
   ``The first 48 hours are very crucial, and the next two weeks,''
said Robert Volpe, a former New York City detective who is a
private consultant specializing in the recovery of art works. ``If
nothing happens, then we have a very different situation going
down.''
   Volpe was confident the works could be recovered, however,
because of what was taken and how.
   ``It's not a smart theft,'' Volpe said. ``The pieces are too
well documented. They're too well known.
   ``The fact that they came in and used violence, this is a little
out of the realm of the normal art thief,'' he said. ``Most art
thieves fashion themselves that they know how to steal.''

legislation to open Army combat jobs to women for a four-year trial.
   ``If we do have a test within the Army, I think finally there
will be documentation to prove that women can perform as
competently as men in the infantry and other combat areas,''
retired Brig. Gen. Evelyn Foote said Monday at a news conference
sponsored by the National Organization for Women.
   The Combat Exclusion Act, approved by Congress in 1948, bars
women in the Air Force, the Marines Corps and the Navy from serving
in combat positions. The Army has regulations similar to the law.
   Women comprise about 11 percent of the total armed forces of 2.1
million.
   The call for re-examination of the policy has grown louder since
Army Capt. Linda Bray led troops fighting Panamanian forces during
the U.S. invasion last December.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., and a senior member of the
House Armed Services Committee, proposed legislation in January
that directs the Army to conduct a test study allowing women
assignment to combat positions.
   Although the legislation faces an uphill fight in Congress,
officials of NOW, Foote and retired Col. Diane Ordes called for a
change in policy starting with passage of Schroeder's bill.

<HEAD>Report Says Bailout Bill Lacks Sufficient Funds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The savings and loan bailout enacted last year
will fall at least $30 billion and possibly as much as $162 billion
short of the amount needed to clean up the industry, says a
congressional report.
   The bill passed last August provided $50 billion to close or
sell failed thrift associations through 1992. However, $48 billion
of that will be needed to cover losses at the 383 institutions
seized by the government through March 5, concluded a report
submitted by Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn.
   Vento is chairman of an 18-member House Banking Committee task
force tracking the performance of the new bailout agency, the
Resolution Trust Corp.
   Regulators expect the failure of an additional 225 to 295 S&amp;Ls
with losses of at least $32 billion to $40 billion, according to
the report. In addition, 295 to 325 S&amp;Ls are weak and may not
recover on their own, it said.
   Depending on the severity of the losses, the shortfall could
rise as high as $162 billion, Vento said.
   Bailout officials, however, say there is enough money to last
into next year. If there's a shortfall after that, money intended
to cover S&amp;L losses after 1992 could be reallocated to cover
earlier failures, they say.

   A longtime resident left an estimated $1
million to this northwest Kansas town to build a municipal
auditorium and city hall. But there's a catch.
   The town has to raise an equal amount of money within two years
of Madonna Mae Morgan's March 4 death in order to receive the
bequest.
   If Oberlin cannot come up with the money, the 88-year-old
woman's gift goes to the Shriners' burn-treatment center for
children in Houston.
   Mrs. Morgan died at a nursing home in Hoxie, about 30 miles to
the south, where she moved about two years ago. She had lived in
Oberlin since 1962.
   Her late husband, Robert, was a retired mail carrier who
invested wisely in farmland, and Mrs. Morgan also inherited some
land, said her attorney, Kenneth Clark.
   About 1,700 acres of farmland will have to be auctioned before
the city knows for sure how much money it has to raise.

   A supermarket deli clerk who didn't want to
miss work was busy taking orders when she got a surprise delivery:
a 6-pound, 15-ounce girl.
   Lillie Mae Guillory, 30, went into labor with her third child
and gave birth Sunday in a tiny room behind the supermarket's video
rental counter.
   ``I'm an idiot,'' she said with a laugh later from a hospital
bed. ``I knew I was close, but I didn't want to miss a day of
work.''
   Mother and daughter were doing fine Monday, said assistant store
director Bobby Jackson.
   ``I said, `Lillie, you are not having that kid on my shift,'''
Jackson recalled. He told her to go home, but it was too late.
   Jackson ran next door, and summoned paramedics.
   Meanwhile, assistant manager Judy Foronda and cashier Diane
Williams helped with the delivery.
   ``I ran to the bakery to get some towels, and by the time I got
back the baby's head'' was just becoming visible, Foronda said.
``Diane held the baby, and I held Lillie's hand, and it just popped
out.''
   Williams also works as a medical assistant for a Tampa doctor,
and helped with a delivery years ago.
   Guillory was fine, ``a little scared,'' Williams said. ``She was
more concerned about people walking in on us than anything else.''
   When paramedics arrived they cut the baby's umbilical cord and
took mother and daughter to the hospital.
   ``My legs have finally stopped shaking,'' Foronda said Monday.
``We're like a family in this store, but this is going too far.''

<HEAD>Federal Judge Acquitted on 1 Count; Mistrial on 7 Others</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. District Judge Robert Aguilar, the
first federal judge charged with racketeering, was acquitted of one
obstruction-of-justice charge. But a jury deadlocked on seven other
felony charges after seven days of deliberations.
   Justice Department prosecutor William Keefer said Aguilar would
be retried on the seven charges.
   One juror, Joan McErlean of San Francisco, said after Monday's
verdict that ``the majority felt that the prosecution did not prove
its case.''
   ``There was no motive. They could not prove there was a meeting
of the minds between the judge and anybody else.''
   Aguilar was acquitted of a charge that he improperly approached
another federal judge, Samuel Conti, to seek favorable treatment
for a friend and creditor, Ronald Cloud, in a pending bank fraud
trial.
   The jury reported it could not reach a verdict on the other
charges. U.S. District Judge Louis Bechtle declared a mistrial and
scheduled proceedings on a possible retrial for June 4.
   Aguilar did not change expression when the jury's verdict was
read, but puffed his cheeks as if to release tension. He declined
to comment afterward.
   Defense lawyer Patrick Hallinan said he was pleased that ``the
jury did not buy the government's allegations of racketeering and
corruption in our courts.''
   But Hallinan said he was disappointed Aguilar was not completely
vindicated.
   Ms. McErlean said the vote was 9-3 to acquit Aguilar of the
charge that he used his office as a ``racketeering enterprise'' to
obstruct justice. It was the first such charge against a federal
judge.
   However, she said nine of the jurors felt Aguilar had committed
one of the illegal acts that was a part of the alleged pattern of
racketeering: helping Vera Hoff, his friend and former legal
secretary, remain a fugitive in Mexico, where she fled in 1979
after being sentenced to two years in prison for tax evasion.
   The Hoff allegation was not charged as a separate count of
obstruction of justice because the five-year legal deadline for
filing the charge had expired when Mrs. Hoff was arrested in Mexico
last year. But it was included in the racketeering charge, which
required proof that Aguilar had misused his office to commit two
specified criminal acts within 10 years.
   Aguilar remains free without bail pending a retrial. The
58-year-old judge from San Jose, who was appointed to the federal
bench in 1980 by President Carter, can be removed from office only
by Congress.
   Aguilar's lawyers have accused the Justice Department of
targeting him as a liberal who had ruled against the government in
important cases. The department denied any political motivation.
   Aguilar has issued rulings restricting factory sweeps by
immigration agents, limiting aerial raids on suspected marijuana
fields, and stopping the government from excluding people from the
country because of homosexuality.
   The counts on which the jury deadlocked included two against
Aguilar's fellow defendants, former Teamster leader Rudy Tham and
Abe Chapman, an 83-year-old ex-convict who was formerly related to
Aguilar by marriage.
   They and Aguilar were charged with plotting to use the judge's
influence to seek a new trial for Tham on a 1980 embezzlement
conviction by having Aguilar speak to U.S. District Judge Stanley
Weigel, who was hearing Tham's case.
   Aguilar said he only asked Weigel about the status of the case,
testimony that Weigel largely confirmed. Aguilar also said he was
only bragging, without foundation, when he told a friend in a
secretly taped conversation that Weigel was indebted to him and
would never reveal their contacts.
   Aguilar also denied trying to influence Conti in Cloud's case,
the charge on which he was acquitted.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl guided his
allies to victory in East German balloting he hopes the momentum
will seal his re-election in West Germany's vote in December.
   But it could be a struggle. Kohl must balance the fervent hopes
of East Germans eager for prosperity with the worries of West
Germans, who fear they'll have to pay for reunification.
   The new leadership chosen by East German voters Sunday supports
Kohl's plans for swift unification with West Germany, and its
election handed Kohl a victory of his own.
   Kohl helped create the three-party Alliance for Germany that won
in East Germany. He advised them in their campaign and barnstormed
across East Germany, promising unification would bring East Germans
Western affluence.
   Newspapers in both German states recognized Kohl's coup.
   ``The real winner is to be found there (in Bonn),'' said East
Germany's Communist-run newspaper, the Berliner Zeitung. ``The
electorate here is trusting promises made by Kohl and his friends
from the big Bonn sister party.''
   Kohl's political opponents in Bonn made the same observation.
   ``The decisive thought for East Germans may have been, `If we
vote for Kohl, the money will flow,''' said Social Democrat Oskar
Lafontaine, announcing that he'll challenge Kohl in West Germany's
elections Dec. 2.
   Kohl hopes the momentum will last through the West German
election.
   The chancellor said Monday he sees ``outstanding chances'' for
his party when elections for a united Germany finally come. He
indicated that would probably be sometime next year.
   The latest polls give Kohl's coalition government a lead of
about 6 percentage points over the Social Democrats. But the polls
indicate a close race if Kohl loses the support of Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher's Free Democrats, the coalition's junior
partner.
   Political experts say that although Kohl won an important
political victory by helping the East German conservative alliance
get elected, there's a chance it could backfire.
   ``After all the happiness and dancing over the results of this
election, we might also be seeing the opening of a Pandora's Box of
complications,'' said Heinrich Vogel, head of the Federal Institute
for Eastern and International Studies in Cologne.
   ``The real work starts right now. This is ground zero,'' Vogel
said in an interview. He said the costs of unification could
tarnish the West German voters' views of Kohl.
   Financial and political experts say the process of German
unification will be complicated and expensive, with West Germans
paying most of the bill.
   In addition, higher unemployment and rising prices for East
Germans are seen as nearly inevitable as the country undergoes
economic metamorphosis. Kohl has told East Germans his government
will protect them from economic shock. Vogel has said this will be
difficult.
   The Handelsblatt, West Germany's most respected financial
newspaper, said the East German election has ``set the course for
an investment boom and an economic upswing, but this upswing must
be painstakingly acquired.''
   East German expectations have put Kohl's government under great
pressure, the newspaper said. ``A belief in miracles would be of
little help.''
   Hans-Jochen Vogel, head of West Germany's Social Democrats, said
it is too early to count his party out for either the December
elections or as possible leaders of a united Germany.
   ``Kohl had set a very high horizon of expectations,'' he said,
by convincing East Germans that reunification can be fast, and by
telling West Germans it is possible without burdens.
   ``But I think the sobering-up will come very quickly,'' he said.

   Tight-wire acrobat Angel Wallenda takes
the scariest walk of her life today when she steps into an
examination room to await word on an operation that may leave her
tied to an oxygen tank for the rest of her life.
   Surgeons at the City of Hope National Medical Center were
scheduled to decide today when to start removing the tumorous
sections of her lungs. It could be the next day.
   ``They're kind of worried because if I wait any longer they
won't be able to do it at all,'' said Angel, who turns 22 today.
``If they take out too much I won't have any left to breathe.''
   She was diagnosed with bone cancer in 1987. Soon after, doctors
amputated her right leg below the knee. They cut away diseased
parts of both lungs in 1988, leaving her with about half the normal
capacity.
   Back then, though, she was able to carry on with an artificial
lower leg. Soon, she was back on the wire with her husband, Steven,
part of the clan that has performed since the 1600s.
   The most famous of all The Flying Wallendas, ``Karl the Great,''
died after a 1978 fall during a performance in Puerto Rico.
Carrying on the tradition is their 3-year-old son, Steven Wallenda
II, who first performed publicly on the trapeze at 11 months.
   The family spent Monday in a motel room near the hospital in
Duarte, a largely residential suburb in the San Gabriel Valley east
of Los Angeles.
   ``She turns 22 tomorrow,'' her 34-year-old husband said. ``We
sure didn't plan it that way. It just happened.''
   Angel and Steven met in New York almost five years ago. She was
working in an ice cream shop at a Westchester County mall where he
was performing, although she didn't learn about his career
immediately as they chatted.
   Later, she was in the audience as he performed.
   ``He was asking for a volunteer out of the audience,'' she said.
``I volunteered.''
   Their working relationship blossomed first, their romance later.
   ``I was more fascinated with the wire,'' Angel said. ``He asked
me if I'd like to learn. But before I could, he went to Jamaica.
   ``When he left I didn't know if I'd ever hear from him again.''
   He called, of course, and the years since have been a storm of
practices and performances, marriage, the birth of their son, her
illness, and now the latest trip to California for lung cancer
surgery.
   What was billed as her final performance took place early this
month at Mansfield University, near the family's home in Tioga, Pa.
Angel said her mind was on screw-ups in the lighting that made it
hard to perform, not on her problems.
   ``The rehearsal went perfect, and then everything went wrong,''
she said. ``It was like I'm sitting there saying, `Turn up the
lights, guys _ come on!'
   ``But in the end it was funny. We improvised and it made it more
homey. They thought it was part of the act.''
   The family said at the time that the latest surgery would end
her career as an aerialist, although her husband and son would
continue the performing tradition.
   The best Angel can hope for now, she's told, is a life tied to
an oxygen tank.
   On Monday, she wasn't so sure. So what if she has to breathe
oxygen. She already performs with a prosthetic leg.
   ``Who says I can't do it?'' Angel Wallenda said.

   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell
sharply to close below the 31,000-point mark Tuesday while the
dollar inched up against the Japanese yen despite a raise in the
Bank of Japan's official discount rate.
   The dollar closed at 153.65 yen, up 0.10 yen from Monday's
close. It opened lower at 152.70 yen and ranged between
152.45-153.75 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 456.05 points, or 1.48
percent, ending the day at 30,807.19, its lowest level since Jan.
9, 1989.
   The index had regained some of its early-morning plunge by the
end of the morning session, but it fell back in the afternoon as
markets were discouraged by the yen's meager recovery following the
Bank of Japan's discount rate hike, dealers said.
   Japan's central bank announced it raised its official discount
rate by 1 percentage point to 5.25 percent, effective immediately.
   On Monday, in its third-largest single-day crash of 1,353.20
points, or 4.15 percent, the index ended at 31,263.24, its lowest
since Jan. 20, 1989. Dealers attributed the plunge to a stronger
dollar and the looming discount rate hike.
   The official discount rate, or the interest rate the central
bank charges on loans to commercial banks and which has a strong
impact on other interest rates, had been 4.25 percent.
   In currency dealings, the market was little affected by the
discount rate hike as it had been already factored into the market,
traders said.

<TEXT>
   Schools throughout West Virginia
reopened after a nearly two-week teacher strike. Some held
counseling sessions to ease tensions between teachers who walked
out and those who crossed picket lines.
   ``I suspect there's a degree of animosity and maybe even
bitterness for those who walked across the picket line,'' Bob
Brown, executive director of the West Virginia Federation of
Teachers, said as teachers returned Monday. ``If they can live with
themselves, we can live with them.''
   The 3,000-member federation and the 16,000-member West Virginia
Education Association began the state's first teacher strike on
March 7. Another 3,000 teachers in the state are not represented by
unions.
   The key issue in the strike was wages. The average teacher
salary of $21,900 is higher than only South Dakota and Arkansas,
the National Education Association says.
   Teachers voted overwhelmingly Sunday to return to work _ without
settling the wage issue _ after legislative leaders promised to ask
Gov. Gaston Caperton to call a special legislative session to
consider a long-term plan for West Virginia's education system.
   The strike had spread to 47 of the state's 55 counties and
affected more than 150,000 pupils.
   In some counties, all the teachers stayed off the job, but in
others, some teachers crossed the picket lines. In Raleigh County
in southern West Virginia, for example, about 30 percent of 900
teachers crossed picket lines, said Dwight Dials, the county school
superintendent.
   State and union officials would not estimate how many teachers
crossed picket lines.
   On Monday, in Berkeley County in the easternmost part of the
state, the county Ministerial Association sent counselors to the
schools to help teachers work out any feelings of animosity toward
each other, said county school spokeswoman Susan Loveland.
   Most schools delayed classes for a few hours Monday so teachers
could prepare for their students. No major problems were reported.
   ``It's over, but it's not over,'' said Lewis County school
Superintendent Joe Mace. ``We'll do the best we can for the kids
for the rest of this school year. You try to mend some fences and
put back the pieces.''
   Some of the biggest headaches were from teachers trying to
reschedule student trips that were canceled and determining what
time would have to be made up, school officials said.
   The June 8 end of the school year will be extended two days to
make up last Thursday and Friday, when state School Superintendent
Hank Marockie canceled all classes in the state for a cooling-off
period.
   The average striking teacher will lose an estimated $660 in pay
and the 6 percent of their pay that normally would be paid into the
financially troubled Teachers Retirement System, Marockie said.
   The finance chairmen of the state Senate and House of Delegates
said Monday there is no more money available for teacher pay raises.
   Delegate George Farley, D-Wood, said the special session ``is
going to raise a lot of expectations.''
   Teachers received a 5 percent raise in February and a two-day
special legislative session last week found $27 million for an
additional 4 percent raise. The teachers union said the latest
legislative package was not enough.
   ``We skimped and scraped to put together a $27 million package
that made nobody happy, and if we did that again it would not make
them happy,'' Farley said.
   A statewide poll released Monday, meanwhile, showed the teachers
enjoyed broad public support.
   The poll of 405 state residents taken during the strike showed
nearly two-thirds opposed threats by state officials to fire
striking teachers who did not return to work by Monday. The margin
of error was 4.9 percentage points.
   ``I think (Caperton) sees how serious we can be and I don't
think teachers will be hesitant to walk again,'' said middle school
teacher Karen Ash in Bunker Hill, Berkeley County.

   A powerful bomb carried by two
suspected Sikh extremists exploded at a busy intersection today,
blowing them apart and killing four bystanders, police said. At
least 17 people were injured.
   There was no immediate indication what the bomb's intended
target might have been. But Home Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed was
due later in the day for a tour of Punjab, the rich farming state
where Sikh militants are waging a violent secessionist campaign.
   The blast damaged vehicles and shattered windows of houses 300
feet away, police spokesman Ashok Kapur said. The dead included two
schoolchildren and three of the injured were in critical condition,
he said.
   The explosion occurred in the most densely populated residential
neighborhood of this joint capital of Punjab and Haryana, northern
states that abut each other. Most of the city's 500,000 residents
are government workers.
   Kapur said the two Sikhs who were carrying the bomb on a motor
scooter were believed to be ``hardcore terrorists.'' He said
identification was difficult because the bodies were blown to
pieces.
   Their motor scooter was destroyed and parts of their bodies were
flung 90 feet away, he said. Press Trust of India said 15 vehicles
were damaged.
   The last extremist attack in Chandigarh occurred in October
1988, when a senior government official was assassinated.
   United News of India said Sikh extremists had killed two people
elsewhere in the state since Monday night.
   The killings came after a sharp rise in extremist-linked
violence, with police blaming militants for the killings of 26
people across Punjab during a 24-hour period ending Monday night.
   The extremists, in their eight-year-old secessionist campaign,
have usually targeted residents in remote villages and travelers on
deserted country roads.
   Sikh militants have killed more than 400 people _ mostly Hindus
and moderate Sikhs _ since January to dramatize their demand for a
separate state they want to carve out of Punjab.
   The separatists claim the Sikh community is culturally and
politically discriminated by the Hindu-dominated government. Sikhs
are in a slight majority in Punjab, but nationwide they comprise
just 2 percent of India's 880 million population. Hindus account
for 82 percent.

   Twentieth Century Fox is banning film critics
Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert from advance screenings of its movies
over remarks they made during a TV interview about the company's
flick, ``Nuns on the Run.''
   ``From now on, they can catch up with our films in the
theater,'' Bob Harper, the film studio's director of marketing,
said in an interview published Monday in the Hollywood Reporter.
   Ebert, a Pulitzer Prize-winning critic for the Chicago
Sun-Times, responded, ``I guess you could call it thumbs on the
run.''
   The move marks the first time that Ebert and Siskel, a Chicago
Tribune film critic, have been barred from special screenings of
movies released by major studios, said Andi Sporkin, spokeswoman
for Buena Vista Television, which produces ``Siskel &amp; Ebert.''
   Buena Vista is a subsidiary of the Los Angeles-based Walt Disney
Co.
   Ms. Sporkin said ``things got blown out of proportion'' after
the duo light-heartedly said they didn't like ``Nuns on the Run''
during an appearance Friday on ``Live With Regis and Kathie Lee''
in New York to tout their upcoming pre-Academy Awards show.
   Siskel and Ebert both gave the film a ``thumbs down'' last week
on their television show, and also panned the movie in syndicated
columns, Ms. Sporkin said.
   ``Nuns on the Run'' is a film about two gangsters who come into
possession of a large sum of money which various bad guys want.
They dodge into a convent, slip into nun's clothing and try to pass
themselves off as sisters.
   Fox contends Siskel and Ebert overstepped their bounds on Friday
because they attacked not only the film but also the marketing
campaign and reviewers who liked it.
   During the broadcast, Ebert held up a newspaper ad for ``Nuns on
the Run'' with a prominent quote from the Village Voice calling it
``the funniest anti-clerical transvestite movie of the decade.''
   He then bantered with Siskel about the fallacy in the ad.
   ``Yeah, this is 1990,'' Ebert said. ``How many other
transvestite, anti-clerical comedies have there been so far in this
decade?''
   But Fox officials were not amused.
   ``We have no problem with them not liking the movie,'' Harper
said. ``But they were on the show promoting their pre-Academy
Awards show and, to our thinking, were acting in the capacity of
entertainers _ not critics.''
   Ebert said he isn't sure ``just what Fox meant by that.''
   ``You might also wonder if this isn't a good way to get some
extra publicity for the movie,'' he said in today's editions of the
Sun-Times. ``Other than that, I have to ask: Where's their sense of
humor?''
   Both critics predicted the ban wouldn't really affect them and
would eventually be rescinded.
   ``We'll just buy tickets and go to the movies for our newspaper
reviews,'' Ebert said. ``The only difference will be on our TV
show. We'll still review the Fox movies, but people won't be able
to see any clips. That's not very smart for Fox, so I wouldn't
expect the ban to last too long.''
   ``Invariably, they are rescinded and no one learns anything.''
   About eight million people watch the ``Siskel &amp; Ebert'' program
weekly, Ms. Sporkin said.

<HEAD>Tokyo Stock Exchange Dives; Dollar Up</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index dived sharply
again today as neither currency market intervention nor a interest
rate boost by the central bank stopped the weakening of the
Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which plunged 1,353.20
points, or 4.15 percent, on Monday in its third-largest single-day
fall, tumbled another 456.05 points, or 1.48 percent, today.
   Its closing of 30,807.19 was the lowest since 30,678.39 on Jan.
9, 1989. So far this year, the index has dived more than 8,100
points, or almost 21 percent.
   Meanwhile, the dollar closed at 153.65 yen, up 0.10 yen from
Monday's close of 153.55 yen. It opened at 152.70 yen and ranged
between 152.45 yen and 153.75 yen. Its closing was the highest
since 153.69 yen on March 12, 1987.
   Stock market investors were discouraged by the yen's failure to
recover after the Bank of Japan announced a 1 percentage point
increase in its discount rate, its charge for loans to commercial
banks, said Yoshiro Inoue, an analyst with Nomura Securities Co.
   Generally, higher interest rates make a country's currency more
attractive to investors.
   The stock index fell in the morning, regained some ground on
word of the impending rate increase, then fell again in the
afternoon, after the increase to 5.25 percent was announced.
   ``The index fell back again as the discount rate hike failed to
boost yen buying,'' Inoue said.
   Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno said today the Central
Bank's ``pre-emptive'' discount rate increase would control latent
inflationary pressures without appreciably slowing Japan's economic
expansion.
   He said, however, the raise would not provide a quick fix for
recent instability in the foreign exchange and stock markets,
although he indicated the rate hike would help both in the long run.
   Inoue said the size of the raise was appropriate, and the end of
the long wait for the action meant elimination of one factor for
instability.
   ``But the stock market's stability is totally subject to
currency movements from now on,'' Inoue said.
   The rate increase had been expected since after national
elections on Feb. 18.
   The discount rate, which has a strong impact on other interest
rates, had been at a historic low of 2.5 percent for nearly nine
years, until May 1989, when the central bank made the first of
three increases that brought it to 4.25 percent by last December.
   Traders said that surprisingly, market players bought the dollar
even afdter the discount rate increase.
   ``The market reaction to the discount rate hike was minimal
because the rate increase already had been factored into the market
for such a long time,'' said Mitsui Bank trader Shinichi Kato.
   He said many market players who anticipated the raise by keeping
short, or oversold, dollar positions bought back dollars as soon as
the rate actually was raised.
   Traders estimated that the Bank of Japan sold some $200 million
today in efforts to prop up the yen. The bank does not comment on
its exchange market activity.
   ``Since many market players saw Japan's interest rate as having
climbed as high as it could, it (discount rate increase) will help
the yen and the stock market recover in the long run,'' Kato said.
``But there is nothing in the current economy to reverse the
dollar-buying trend and prompt yen-buying.''
   The price of the benchmark No. 119 Japanese government bond
ended trading at 86.27 points, down from Monday's close of 86.50.
Its yield was 7.29 percent, up from 7.24 percent.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will implement a
drastic economic reforms in July that include selling state-owned
enterprises and overhauling government-set prices to reflect market
forces, media reports said.
   The package of 17 measures, aimed at ending a dire economic
crisis, is expected to be painful and unpopular, the Interfax news
agency said.
   The agency also quoted a close aide to Gorbachev as saying the
crisis is so prfound that the Soviet Union might no longer object
to massive foreign aid. Soviet officials previously have appeared
offended when Western officials raised the possibility of aid.
   ``I would like to underline that such aid would be in the
interests of not only the Soviet Union, but of the entire world
community, Western countries included. But they do not seem to be
fully aware of that,'' said the aide, economist Nikolai Petrakov.
   Last month, Petrakov revealed that the Soviet leadership had
dropped its long opposition to private ownership of factories.
   After his inauguration to the powerful new presidency on
Thursday, Gorbachev said he was planning harsh economic reforms
that would require great sacrifices. Western analysts speculated
that Gorbachev felt he needed the enhanced power of the new post
before going got ahead with a program that could provoke serious
unrest.
   Economists say the Soviet economy suffers from too much money in
the hands of the people, who have nothing spend it on.
   Central economic planning has proved a failure, and the people
want for food and consumer goods of decent quality.
   Prices are set by central planners and many are unrealistically
low, with state subsidies for housing, transport and essential
consumer items.
   Interfax said in its report Monday that the reform package would
take effect July 1 and provide for the selling off of many
government-owned factories. It said another aspect was a plan for
making the ruble convertible.
   Economists say real pricing and a move toward a ruble whose
value is determined by world market forces would bring about
immediate inflation, accompanied by high unemployment.
   But doing nothing could be more dangerous. Coal miners unhappy
with the lack of improvement since their paralyzing strike last
summer have threatened renew walkouts.
   Interfax said the plan was drafted by 60 Soviet economists and
modeled on the one that took effect Jan. 1 in Poland, which decided
to leap directly into a market system in hopes of shortening the
painful period of transition after decades of Communist rule.
   Empty stores have been stocked, and Poles no longer have to
stand in long lines to buy what they need. The zloty has become
partially convertible thanks to a massive Western aid program,
which probably is impossible to duplicate for an economy the size
of the Soviet Union's.
   But unemployment is on the rise in Poland and experts say it
reach 1 million or more as inefficient enterprises are closed.
   Petrakov said the Soviets hope to eliminate excess rubles by
giving consumers the opportunity to buy goods that have been
illegal or impossible, including shares of stock, houses,
apartments and garden plots.
   Western sources say that in recent weeks Soviet trade
organizations have not paid their bills, giving the impression that
the country is running out of hard, Western currency.
   Petrakov also hinted there might be a shakeup in key economic
ministries now that Gorbachev has become official leader of the
government instead of Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov.
   Petrakov did not say whether Ryzhkov's job was in danger, but
the prime minister is responsible for the economy.
   ``Heads of ministries and departments are displaying sheer
irresponsibility in all questions,'' Petrakov said.
   Gorbachev's economic plan will include decisive measures,
deadlines and the names of the people in charge, he said.

<TEXT>
   Premier Li Peng opened China's annual legislative
session today by proclaiming that China will never yield to
attempts to undermine its socialist system and Communist rule.
   In a speech of more than two hours to the nearly 3,000 deputies
of the National People's Congress, Li also said the state would
exert more control over the economy but ease austerity measures
that have stalled economic growth.
   Li's state of the nation address sets the tone of the 15-day
meeting, which is expected to show unwavering support for the
party's hard-line political and economic policies.
   Li began by noting the ``soul-stirring struggles'' of 1989,
including the victory over the ``counter-revolutionary rebellion''
_ the government's term for the student-led pro-democracy movement
crushed by military force in June.
   He said the pro-democracy movement was led by hostile forces
trying to turn China into a bourgeois republic dependent on
capitalist countries.
   ``Only socialism can save China,'' Li said. If China turns
toward capitalism, ``a polarization of classes would inevitably
arise, the overwhelming majority of people would sink into poverty
and social unrest would prevail for a long time to come. Fraud,
degeneration and crime, inherent in a society of exploiting
classes, would spread unchecked.''
   Li, wearing a Western suit, was only occasionally applauded as
he plodded through the speech. Sitting behind him on the podium
were about 150 senior officials, including Communist Party General
Secretary Jiang Zemin, President Yang Shangkun and members of the
party Politburo.
   For the second straight year senior leader Deng Xiaoping did not
appear at the opening session. Also missing was Zhao Ziyang, the
former party chief who was purged from all party posts last year
after being accused of supporting the pro-democracy movement. Zhao
is still a deputy from Sichuan province.
   Li said China had also achieved victories last year in
straightening out the economy and improving the ideological
orientation of its citizens.
   He said austerity measures instituted in late 1988 had succeeded
in halving inflation while bringing economic growth down to a
manageable level.
   But he acknowledged that Chinese industry is beset by rising
debt, factory closures and stockpiling of goods, and said steps
will be taken to ``ameliorate the present contradictions.''
   The steps include relaxing curbs on the money supply, increasing
loans to enterprises, adjusting interest rates for loans and
savings deposits, increasing investment in key industries and
housing and engaging in water conservation and other public works
projects.
   Gross national product should rise by 5 percent in 1990, up from
3.8 percent last year, he said.
   On the ideological front, he said ``the influence of bourgeois
liberalization thinking and repulsive social phenomena still need
to be done away with.''
   Universities and colleges must stress education in
Marxism-Leninism and Maoist thought, he said, adding that
intellectuals should ``become one with workers and peasants'' and
the arts and television ``must be oriented towards serving
socialism and the people.''
   He urged the government to boost agricultural production this
year and to revive the stagnant economy.
   But there was little hint of the market-oriented reforms
initiated by Deng in 1979 and responsible for China's rapid
economic growth through the 1980s.
   China's open door policy will continue, Li said, but cautioned
that China must ``maintain sharp vigilance and resolutely combat''
the trend of Western-style democracy with a multiparty system.
   On foreign affairs, Li said China is ``naturally concerned about
the drastic political changes that have taken place in Eastern
Europe'' but hopes to maintain normal, friendly relations with
those countries where Communist rulers have been ousted in the past
year.t
   He said China hopes for improved relations with the United
States and the West. He criticized Western sanctions imposed after
the Chinese troops killed hundreds of civilians last June in
breaking up pro-democracy protests.
   China ``never yields to external pressure and ... No one can
succeed in isolating China,'' siad Li.
   He warned that China ``will not ignore'' the pro-independence
movement on Taiwan and said China is on guard against those trying
to make Hong Kong a base for overthrowing China's socialist system.
   During the 15-day session, the congress will approve a basic law
that Hong Kong would observe after it reverts to Chinese rule in
1997.
   It will also pass an amendment to a law guaranteeing that
foreign enterprises in China will not be nationalized.

   Morris Bailey leaned forward from his
lawn chair to his walker, from the shade into the sun, so his eyes
could take in both diamonds at once.
   ``Baseball,'' said the 74-year-old Bailey, breaking into a wide
grin. ``Real baseball is on the way.''
   And so it is. After 32 days, an agreement reached Sunday night
ended the lockout that had delayed the start of spring training for
major league players.
   Teams immediately began assembling at their training camps to
prepare for the start of the season, which will begin April 9, a
week later than scheduled. Exhibition games are scheduled to begin
Monday.
   Many fans who have had to make do with less also made plans to
be on hand today when major league training camps open across
Arizona and Florida.
   In that regard, Bailey, 74, was ahead of most. He was assured
tickets to the San Francisco Giants' home contests at Scottsdale
Stadium because his grandson, catcher Mark Bailey, was invited to
training camp after playing with the New York Mets Triple-A
Tidewater affiliate last season.
   ``And starting tomorrow,'' said Morris Bailey, a Springfield,
Mo., native who retired from his job as a production supervisor in
a factory 15 years ago and took to wintering in Scottsdale some
nine years ago, ``Mark will start drawing big-league pay.''
   The agreement between major-league players and owners guarantees
a minimum major-league salary of $100,000, a figure that only two
decades ago was the subject of salary disputes by superstars such
as Willie Mays.
   Another highlight of the pact was the owners' promise of salary
arbitration eligibility for 17 percent of the players with between
two and three years of service.
   With the lockout over, few could restrain their joy at the
prospect of again hearing the crack of the bat or gasping over a
shoe-string catch.
   On the other side from Bailey of those same diamonds at Indian
School Park, Giants' manager Roger Craig crossed one lizard-skinned
cowboy boot over the other, uncrossed them and cast a more
dispassionate eye on the minor league prospects working out on
either side of them.
   But like Bailey, he couldn't wait for the real thing when the
major league stars took the field.
   ``Spring training is something special. You could mark time by
it,'' he said, his voice lowering, ``until now.
   ``You hear the bats popping, the leather popping, you smell the
grass. We had that,'' he said, ``but it didn't seem the same.''
   Will Hill understood. He showed up at Municipal Stadium in
nearby Phoenix with 10-year-old son, Marlos, in tow Monday to pick
up tickets. The 42-year-old postal inspector and his son have made
Oakland A's contests a rite of spring for the past five years, and
discouraged as both were by the lockout, they weren't about to let
it go now.
   ``Little league kept him busy,'' Hill said, ``but as soon as we
heard this thing ended, I knew we'd wind up here today.''
   About a dozen others dotted the stands for the same reason. And
if the sounds of lawn mowers buzzing and sprinklers hissing wasn't
quite as reassuring as the thwack of bat, it seemed like the next
best thing.
   ``I'm still so mad I could burst,'' 71-year-old Bernie Bates
said, her hand resting on husband Warren's shoulders. ``But we're
suckers for baseball. That's why we're here.''

   H.L. Peterson paid $2.6 million for a
cave he wanted to turn into a lavish vacation retreat for the rich
and famous, but a leaky roof has doused his dream.
   Recent property-tax assessments on Beckham Creek Cave indicate
the place is virtually worthless, a state official says.
   Now Peterson has accused seller John Hay, a Boulder, Colo.,
businessman, of fraud in a $13.7 million federal lawsuit filed in
St. Louis. U.S. District Judge Clyde Cahill is to hear the case on
Aug. 27.
   Peterson bought the cave in the Boston Mountains range of the
Ozarks in August 1988. He spent $500,000 renovating it and put on a
Halloween party attended by nearly 300 guests that year.
   But since then, he has abandoned his plan to turn the unusual
structure into a luxury hideaway for the elite ``because he doesn't
think the leaky cave home would be a suitable hotel,'' Peterson
lawyer Charles Medley said. Medley said he had advised Peterson
against discussing the case.
   In June 1989, Hay called Peterson's lawsuit frivolous. He said
Peterson had ``fallen out of love'' with the cave and that the suit
was a case of ``buyer's remorse.'' More recently, Hay has refused
to discuss the lawsuit.
   During the mid-1980s, Hay converted a series of caverns into the
10,000-square foot, five-bedroom, five-bath bomb shelter, with
gold-plated fixtures on bathroom equipment, a kitchen with all the
conveniences and other lavish digs.
   Outside are a man-made pond, a helicopter pad, and an expansive
front deck with a Jacuzzi.
   But entering the cave, visitors are sprinkled by what appears to
be raindrops from the overhanging rock eave, an indication of
bigger problems inside. In winter, the droplets turn to icicles,
caretaker Gerald Causse said.
   The cave is cold, damp, musty. Causse has set out dozens of
plastic buckets and bottles of all sizes to trap the water that
pours through the epoxy-lined roof. Huge sheets of plastic are hung
to direct the flow and prevent flooding of the two-tier tiled great
room during heavy rain.
   ``When you try to dry this place up it just gets worse,'' he
said. ``My biggest headache is kicking buckets, emptying buckets
and slipping. Emptying buckets is a daily chore and when its
raining you might as well sit up here.''
   In summer, the battle is with mildew, Causse said, and every
cranny attracts lizards and creepy crawlers.
   Larry Crane, director of the state Assessment Coordination
Division, said the cave house was valued at $1.7 million for tax
purposes in 1989.
   But that the value could drop as low as $150,000 for 1990, Crane
said _ and ``the reality is that there are major water problems and
that the cave house itself has little value, if any.''

of January's U.S. trade figures.
   Steve Marks, a currency analyst at Hill Samuel Bank Ltd., said
the markets were also keeping a close eye on developments in
Lithuania.
   He said any signs of excessive aggression on the part of the
Soviet Union would likely to boost support for the dollar. The
dollar is generally seen as a safe haven currency during times of
international tension or unrest.
   Others said they expected the dollar to drop after the release
of the trade figures. Analysts predict the data will show a
widening in the U.S. merchandise trade gap.
   In London, currency dealers were also waiting to see what
Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major would do in his first budget
statement to be delivered in Parliament this afternoon.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.10 yen to a closing 153.65 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a lower rate of 153.00 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:
   _1.6835 West German marks, up from 1.6829
   _1.5060 Swiss francs, down from 1.5085
   _5.6900 French francs, up from 5.6895
   _1.8995 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8970
   _1,245.50 Italian lire, up from 1,244.25
   _1.1795 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1836
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound, and was
quoted at $1.6225, compared with $1.6110 late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $401.25 a troy ounce, up
from $402.45 bid late Monday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $400.80.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $401.00, down from $402.50 late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.28 to close at a bid $400.76.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.11 dollars a troy
ounce, from Monday's $5.13.

   Although the outcome of Wednesday's
presidential election is a foregone conclusion with the incumbent
the only candidate, a strong sense of political uncertainty has
gripped Taiwan.
   President Lee Teng-hui seems certain to win a six-year term from
the electoral college, but the election may not end the political
crisis that has enveloped Taiwan in recent weeks.
   Lee, 67, is facing pressure from the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party and the public to quickly scrap a political
system largely dominated by elderly politicians from mainland China
and give Taiwanese a greater say in choosing their leaders.
   Lee also is facing an intense struggle within his ruling
Nationalist Party, where his rivals would like to dilute his power
by changing from a strong presidency to a Cabinet-led government.
   He has ``fallen into a den of wolves and is in the wilderness.
No wonder he often prays these days, what else can he do?'' the
country's most respected political magazine, The Journalist, said
in an editorial on the devout Christian president.
   Indeed, Taiwan has resembled a three-ring political circus in
the weeks leading to the electoral college vote.
   This island of 20 million people witnessed an unprecedented
challenge to Lee's candidacy from within his own party.
   The challenge was triggered by Lee's decision to nominate his
personal aide as the party candidate for vice president instead of
Chiang Wego, the sole surviving son of the late Nationalist
strongman Chiang Kai-shek.
   Many aging Nationalist politicians who fled to Taiwan with
Chiang Kai-shek after losing the civil war to Communist forces in
1949 view his son as the main standard-bearer of their unlikely
dream to one day return victoriously to the Chinese mainland.
   The crisis was diffused only after eight Nationalist elders
intervened and convinced the party's Old Guard to drop plans to
offer a rival ticket at the electoral college meeting.
   But dissatisfaction with Lee remains strong within the party and
many Nationalist leaders would like to increase the powers of the
Cabinet at the expense of the presidency.
   Lee, a native Taiwanese, had no power base of his own when he
was elevated to head of government two years ago after Chiang
Ching-kuo, the eldest son of Chiang Kai-shek, died and four decades
of family rule ended. Lee has managed to remain at the top largely
because of his widespread public support.
   Meanwhile, the presidential vote has led to intense public
opposition to the electoral college, which is dominated by
politicians elected on the Chinese mainland in 1947 who have not
faced re-election since. The elderly deputies remain in office in
support of the claim that the Nationalists are still the legitimate
government of all China.
   A majority of the lawmaking Legislative Yuan also is comprised
of aging Nationalists.
   On Sunday, the main opposition party organized the largest
protest in Taiwan since the lifting of 38 years of martial law in
1987. More than 20,000 people protested the continued dominance of
the electoral college by the elderly deputies.
   About 5,000 students staged a rally today at a downtown park for
the second straight day to demand the dissolution of the electoral
college. Nearly 50 of them were on hunger strike to press the
demands, and one was hospitalized with stomach problems. The
protest was significant because Taiwan students rarely get involved
in politics.
   Lee today responded to the outcry for democratic change by
agreeing to convene an emergency conference of political and other
leaders to discuss changing the country's political system. There
was no elaboration on what changes he might have in mind and no
date was specified. Top opposition officials said the conference
would occur in May or June.
   Political observers said Lee could not act on change until after
his confirmation by the electoral college, whose members are wary
of any democratic change that would lessen their power.
   ``We don't know what Lee plans to do. He never speaks out,''
said Chang Chung-tung, professor of history at National Taiwan
University.
   The president ``may not have clear ideas about the future
redistribution of power and democratic reforms yet,'' Chang said.
``Even if he does, he cannot speak about it before he consolidates
his power.''

   Gov. Joseph Ada said a fetus is a human being
in signing a bill creating the most restrictive U.S. abortion
statute, but abortion rights advocates already are challenging the
measure.
   Janet Benshoof, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer,
immediately violated the law by telling women in a speech where to
go to have an abortion, and the territory's attorney general _ who
personally opposes the measure _ pressed charges.
   Territorial Attorney General Elizabeth Barrett-Anderson says
prosecuting the case will be ``a heavy burden,'' but a
responsibility of her job.
   Benshoof made a court appearance Tuesday, Guam time, but
Superior Court Judge Ramon V. Diaz said he could not hear the case
because he did not feel he could render a fair and impartial
decision.
   Benshoof is scheduled to be arraigned today.
   The law, which passed despite a ruling by Barrett-Anderson that
it is unconstitutional, makes it a third-degree felony for a person
to perform or help in an abortion. Seeking or having an abortion or
soliciting someone to have an abortion are misdemeanors.
   The law also sets a referendum during the Nov. 6 general
election for residents of this Pacific Ocean island about 1,500
miles east of the Philippines to decide whether to keep the law.
   ``In my heart, I believe that a fetus is a human being,'' Ada,
the Republican governor, said in signing the bill, which prohibits
abortion except when the mother's health or life are endangered.
   Benshoof said she immediately violated a provision of the law by
advising women in a speech at the Guam Press Club later in the day
to go to Hawaii to have legal abortions.
   ``I was very specific in my breaking of the law,'' Benshoof
said. ``The information that I gave, which is now a crime, came
from the Honolulu Yellow Pages.''
   Barrett-Anderson filed a misdemeanor complaint charging Benshoof
with violating the ban on soliciting someone to have an abortion.
Benshoof faces up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine if convicted.
   ``It's a matter of public record that I advised the Guam
Legislature ... that in my opinion the bill was unconstitutional by
operation of the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade,''
Barrett-Anderson said later in a statement.
   ``My advisory role has now shifted to one of enforcement. This
is a heavy burden, but ... I will enforce this statute to the
extent that the law allows.''
   Benshoof, who went to Guam to try to persuade Ada not to sign
the bill, was not arrested but appeared in court voluntarily.
   Guam's 21-member unicameral Legislature unanimously approved the
bill March 8 after Archbishop Anthony Apuron threatened in an
interview with a television reporter to excommunicate any Roman
Catholic senator who voted against it. All but one of the senators
is Catholic, as is Ada. However, most of the senators said they
were unaware of the threat.
   Among those hailing the new law was the National Right to Life
Committee.
   ``This is great news,'' group spokeswoman Nancy Myers said in a
telephone interview from her Washington office. ``The people of
Guam are largely pro-life as reflected by the unanimous vote in the
Legislature, and they have made a strong statement.''

<HEAD>Sharansky Criticizes Israel's Censorship Of Soviet Immigration</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Human rights advocate Natan Sharansky today
criticized Israel's censorship of reports on Soviet immigration,
saying it was hurting efforts to settle the new arrivals.
   Sharansky, a former Soviet refusnik, was joined by an official
of a resettlement agency in complaining about excessive censorship.
   The ban on publication of immigration figures was imposed March
1 amid mounting Arab protests the influx could lead to more Jewish
settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, home
to 1.7 million Palestinians.
   Sharansky, who heads the Soviet Jewry Zionist Forum, said today
some self-censorship might be needed to ensure the security of the
immigrants.
   But he said, ``We need more support from world Jewry and, to
make bureaucrats work more effectively, we need more public
pressure. We can't do it under conditions of censorship.''
   Sharansky and other Israeli activists have said the Jewish state
is not preparing enough housing and jobs for the arriving Soviets.
   Gad Ben-Ari, spokesman for the Jewish Agency, which shares
responsibility with the government for resettling immigrants, said
his group appealed to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to have the
censorship guidelines limited to two issues _ long-term immigration
projections and new transit routes.
   ``The process of fund-raising, especially in our Operation
Exodus campaign for the Soviets, depends a great deal on a constant
flow of accurate information about the immigration,'' Ben-Ari said.
``We are already having difficulties,''
   Operation Exodus aims to raise $200 million in each of the next
three years from Jews in the United States and Europe.
   In early March, Israel's military censor declared all material
on the immigration of Soviet Jews had to be submitted to the censor
prior to publication.
   Yossi Olmert, head of the Government Press Office, said today
despite that the broad wording of the censorship rule, it was
actually limited to two items, the number of immigrants and routes
of getting to Israel.
   ``American Jewry knows full well we are speaking of a big drama,
a big operation,'' Olmert said. ``Whether the number is `x' or `y'
isn't necessarily the most important item right now.''
   The immigration surge began last year, when 12,000 Soviet Jews
came to Israel, spurred by eased exit policies in the Soviet Union
and tighter U.S. immigration rules. Israeli leaders have said they
expect up to 750,000 Soviet immigrants this decade.
   Arab groups have protested the influx, and the Islamic Jihad for
the Liberation of Palestine said last week it would target airlines
and airports involved in the immigration.
   On Monday, the 46-member Organization of the Islamic Conference
issued a statement in Saudi Arabia calling on Arab states ``to use
all possible means and methods'' to prevent Soviet Jews from moving
to the occupied territories.
   The Arab outcry began after Shamir said in mid-January the wave
of immigration required ``the Land of Israel, a large and strong
Israel.'' Palestinians interpreted the statement as meaning Israel
intended to keep the occupied territories, which were captured from
Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Shamir later said the immigrants were not being directed to the
territories.

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Cabinet today
agreed to begin scrapping special benefits for East German settlers
in an attempt to stop them from flooding into West Germany, a
government official said.
   The decision is aimed at encouraging East Germans to stay home
and help rebuild their country and to relieve the burden East
German resettlers are putting on West German social services.
   About 500,000 East Germans have settled in West Germany in the
past 14 months and the Kohl government is under increasing
political pressure to stem the continuing influx.
   The Cabinet move came two days after East Germany's first free
election in which a conservative alliance allied to Kohl's party
won. The winners are still negotiating on forming a coalition East
German government that will help set the pace for unifying the two
Germanys.
   The Bonn government official, speaking on condition he not be
identified, said that as of July 1, West Germany will no longer
have a special program for helping East Germans who move west.
   It was not immediately clear whether the decision means the
settlers will receive absolutely no special benefits, but a closing
of dozens of reception centers appeared to be in the offing.
   The government official said details would be released later in
the day.
   As part of the current program, East Germans register for
special benefits such as unemployment, and they also receive help
in finding jobs and housing. They also are put up at special
reception centers as they look for housing.
   The exodus has seriously bled East Germany's economy and is
straining West Germany's own housing and job markets.
   In Sunday's elections, East Germans gave 48 percent of the vote
to a conservative coalition actively backed by Kohl that promises
quick unification. After the victory, Kohl appealed to East Germans
to stay home. He repeated the message Monday night on West German
television.
   ``Please stay home,'' the chancellor said in an interview with
the ZDF network. ``Unpack your bags. Go back to the factories and
offices, and help in building up the country.''
   A new ZDF poll released hours after East Germany's election said
only 13 percent of West Germans still welcome their compatriots
from the East now that they have freely chosen a government. The
poll showed 43 percent of West Germans have no understanding for
the continued exodus, and more than half want to cut aid to the
immigrants.
   Bremen, one of the 11 West German states, said Monday it would
not help East Germans find housing. The local government said its
camps for East Germans were overflowing and it would accept only
thos who find their own housing.
   Bremen Mayor Herbert Schmalstieg urged the federal government to
close reception centers for the refugees and send back all East
Germans who cannot be housed by local communities.
   Last week, the governors of all 11 West German states asked the
federal government to cut benefits to stop the influx.
   Kohl told ZDF that a monetary union between the two countries
would come soon, certainly before the end of the year. He wants
West Germany's powerful mark to replace East Germany's weak
currency to prop up East Germans' buying power and induce them to
stay home.
   The chancellor said he hoped East Germany's Parliament would
vote to merge with West Germany under a provisison provided by West
Germany's constitution.
   ``But I don't think the subject will be on tomorrow,'' Kohl said.
   The conservatives' victory was seen as a political triumph for
Kohl, who campaigned hard on their behalf.
   The three-party coalition led by East Germany's Christian
Democratic Union, a sister party of Kohl's own party of the same
name, swept to victory by promising a quick monetary union and
rapid unification.
   But the alliance failed to gain an absolute majority in the new
400-seat Parliament and will need to find a coalition partner to be
able to govern. The conservative alliance ended with a total of 193
seats.
   Lothar de Maiziere, the Christian Democratic Union chief likely
to become East Germany's new premier, on Monday offered to form an
alliance with the left-leaning Social Democrats, a move backed by
Kohl.
   But the Social Democrats, heavy losers in the election but still
the second-strongest party with 87 seats, spurned the offer.
   A three-party centrist, Liberal alliance supported by West
Germany's Free Democrats, the junior coalition partner in Kohl's
government, indicated it was ready to negotiate an alliance. The
Liberals hold 21 seats in Parliament.

<TEXT>
   Capucine, the French movie actress
whose leading roles included one with Peter Sellers in ``The Pink
Panther,'' died after falling from a window. Police said she
committed suicide. She was 57.
   The actress, born Germaine Lefebvre, died Saturday after
plunging from her eighth-floor attic apartment and police inspector
Claude Zbinden said an investigation left no doubt that she
committed suicide.
   The Lausanne newspaper Le Matin said she shared the apartment
with three cats. It quoted an unidentified friend as saying that
she had been suffering from depression.
   A former model, the Toulon-born Capucine came to the United
States in the late 1950's where she studied drama under Gregory
Ratoff. She later continued her screen career in Europe, settling
in Lausanne in 1961.
   In addition to ``The Pink Panther'' which came out in 1964, her
films included ``Song Without End'' and ``Walk on the Wild Side,''
in 1962, ``What's New Pussycat'' in 1965, ``Fellini Satyricon'' in
1969, and ``Martin Eden'' in 1979.
   Among more recent roles was one in the French TV film,
``Quartier Negre,'' based on a novel by Georges Simenon.

<HEAD>Regan Withdraws Duplicity Charge Against Wiesel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former White House chief of staff Donald T.
Regan agreed to delete a passage from his memoirs after Nobel
laureate Elie Wiesel threatened him with a $10 million libel
lawsuit, lawyers for both men said.
   In his book, ``For the Record,'' Regan charged that Wiesel made
a televised plea for then-President Reagan not to visit the Bitburg
military cemetery in West Germany ``after assuring me he would do
no such thing.''
   Wiesel made the plea during a ceremony in Washington in April
1985 at which Reagan awarded him the Congressional Gold Medal. His
lawsuit, never filed, maintained that he made no assurance to Regan
of silence on Bitburg, lawyers said Monday.
   In exchange for Wiesel dropping the threatened suit, Regan
instructed his publisher, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc., to delete
the disputed phrase from any future editions of ``For the Record.''
   Regan also wrote Wiesel a two-paragraph letter, dated Jan. 29,
in which he said of Wiesel's version of events: ``I hadn't
remembered it that way.'' He said he was withdrawing the phrase
``since I did not mean to offend you.''
   The suit said Regan's charge made it appear that Wiesel had
agreed to be silent on Bitburg so he would receive the
congressional medal.
   Reagan was criticized for visiting Bitburg because Nazi SS
troops are buried there. Wiesel, a survivor of the Nazi slaughter
of Jews during World War II, won the Nobel Peace Prize for his
writings examining the Holocaust.
   The settlement, reported in the National Jewish Post and Opinion
newspaper, was confirmed by lawyers for Wiesel, Regan and Harcourt.

<TEXT>
   Lithuania's president denied Kremlin
accusations that his Baltic republic plans to seize state
enterprises and sell them to private owners, and called a harsh
warning from Moscow a negotiating ploy.
   Vytautas Landsbergis, speaking before the republic's parliament
on Monday, said he believed that the increasing tension between
Moscow and Vilnius was part of the ``difficult beginning'' to talks
on Lithuania's independence.
   In a nationally televised broadcast late Monday, the Soviet
government warned Lithuania not to errect customs posts, introduce
its own currency or take over Moscow-run factories without Kremlin
permission.
   The announcement did not say what would happen if Lithuania
ignored the warning, but Soviet troops in the past day have carried
out military maneuvers in the republic that Lithuanians say are
aimed at intimidation.
   Landsbergis said Moscow's statements were based on mistaken
information, according to television editor Eduardas Potashinskas,
who monitored the session.
   ``It is not true that we are going to pass state-owned
enterprises to private owners,'' Landsbergis was quoted as saying.
   Lithuania's parliament voted on March 11 to secede from the
Soviet Union and restore the independence it enjoyed before being
forcibly annexed in 1940 along with the other Baltic states _
Estonia and Latvia.
   Four days later, the Soviet Parliament declared the decree
invalid, but also did not specify measures Moscow might take to
prevent Lithuania's succession.
   ``I regard the statement as a difficult beginning of
negotiations, as an exchange of opinions that sometimes widely
diverge and sometimes coincide,'' Landsbergis was quoted as saying.
   In Moscow, Egidius Bickauskas, a Lithuanian legislator, said
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told him and other Lithuanian
representatives about the warning when he met with them for 30
minutes late Monday.
   Bickauskas and Lithuanian legislator Vaidotas Antanaitis
delivered a letter from Landsbergis rejecting Gorbachev's deadline
_ which expired Monday _ for returning to the Soviet fold.
   Gorbachev has said he is willing to carry on a ``respectful
dialogue'' with Lithuanian representatives.
   The Kremlin on Monday accused Lithuania of trying to ``undermine
its links'' with the rest of the Soviet Union, which it said could
have ``pernicious consequences'' for the national economy.
   The Soviet statement ordered police, the KGB, and customs agents
to resist any attempts by Lithuania to change the existing customs
regime. It also directed the management of Soviet enterprises and
agencies in Lithuania not to hand over authority to local bodies.
   The announcement said the government was especially concerned
about atomic energy plants in Lithuania, and ordered the guard over
them increased.
   Moscow said it sympathized with Lithuania's strivings for
greater sovereignty, but this should be pursued only with ``strict
observance of Soviet laws and taking into consideration the mutual
interests of the peoples of Lithuania and other republics.''
   Landsbergis said his government agreed with aspects of Moscow's
statement, including the benefits of retaining strong economic ties.
   Many Lithuanians say they expected Moscow to punish the republic
by imposing an economic blockade and depriving it of fuel and raw
materials. But the Kremlin on Monday did not threaten such measures.
   Moscow leaders have also said they have ruled out the use of
troops to force Lithuania back into the Soviet Union.
   However, a spokesman for the Lithuanian nationalist movement
Sajudis, Lionginas Vasiliauskas, said in Moscow that 10 truckloads
of Soviet troops were moved Monday from Kaunas, about 60 miles from
Vilnius, to a military post just outside the capital.
   Residents said Monday that the military maneuvers carried out
over the weekend appeared over. But Radio Vilnius said it had
``reliable information'' that its broadcasts to foreign countries
had been blocked by Radio Moscow.
   A loud hum could be heard during a Radio Vilnius broadcast
monitored in Washington on Monday night.
   Lithuanian activist Eduardas Potashinskas said he thought most
Lithuanians would take the Kremlin's warning calmly.
   ``We say the Soviet empire is showing its teeth,'' he said from
Vilnius. ``But we think they can't threaten Lithuania. We'll be
calm. We'll fall and get up, but we'll go on.''
   Soviet television has shown several programs in the last two
days focusing on discontent among Lithuania's ethnic minorities,
who comprise about 20 percent of the republic's 3.8 million people.
   Late Monday, the nightly news program Vremya showed an
anti-independence meeting in the Lithuanian port of Klaipeda, at
which one speaker said: ``We don't want to live in bourgeois
Lithuania.'' The Baltic port is valuable to the Soviet military.
   A Vremya anchorman also read an appeal from a demonstration
Sunday in Vilnius that drew tens of thousands of ethnic Russians
and Poles.
   The appeal, addressed to Gorbachev, said: ``Hypocritically and
arrogantly, the interests of many thousands of people who are
categorically against being torn from the peoples of the USSR are
being ignored.''

   The district attorney's office bought a
Chinatown clothing factory, used undercover police to run it and
determined that organized crime has a stranglehold on the garment
industry, The New York Times reported today.
   The police, who supervised 25 garment workers in the noisy loft
factory, found that mob-affiliated trucking companies were shaking
down clothing manufacturers.
   The investigators gathered evidence against two organized crime
families, the newspaper said. No charges have been filed, but
authorities said evidence will be presented to a grand jury.
   ``The evidence we have so far turned up shows that organized
crime has a monopolistic stranglehold over trucking companies and
the truckers are the lifeblood of the city's garment industry,''
Manhattan District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau told the Times.
   Threats and extortion demands by trucking representatives were
secretly recorded during the set-up, unidentified investigators
told the newspaper.
   The trucking employees told the undercover agents which trucker
would have the sole right to move their goods, the newspaper said.
Prices were not negotiable.
   If the company used another trucking company, it would still
have to pay the one designated by the organized crime figures, the
Times said.
   Records of 10 garment district truckers were seized Jan. 30.
Unidentified officials said seven of the 10 are controlled by
Thomas Gambino, who has been identified by law enforcement
officials as a captain in the Gambino crime family, and that two of
the others are affiliated with figures in the Lucchese crime family.
   Thomas Gambino's attorney, Michael Rosen, said suggestions that
Gambino was connected to criminal activity were ``hysterical
accusations by people in law enforcement who have to justify their
existence,'' the Times said.
   Thomas Gambino, 60, is the son of the late Carlo Gambino,
reputed founder of the crime family that bears his name. The
Gambino organization is said to be the most powerful organized
crime group in the nation. Law enforcement officials believe it is
now headed by John Gotti.
   Thomas Gambino is married to Catherine Lucchese, the daughter of
the late Thomas Lucchese, who is said to have founded the Lucchese
crime family.
   The district attorney's office paid $25,000 for the garment
contracting company in Chinatown with sewing machines and other
equipment, said Michael G. Cherkasky, an assistant district
attorney in charge of the inquiry.
   The company, which operated for most of last year, sewed skirts
and jeans and delivered them to jobbers or manufacturers who
provided the fabric. The firm lost $10,000 last year.
   The firm's business was run by six state police officers. State
investigators were used instead of city police officers to reduce
the chances that an undercover agent would be recognized, Cherkasky
said.
   Cherkasky said he expected a grand jury will hear evidence of
extortion, price-fixing and racketeering in several months.

<HEAD>Two Men Found Dead In Liferaft As Search For Missing Ships
Continues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANBERRA, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two men were found dead in a liferaft
off the coast of Western Australian state today, but searchers
found no trace of two missing ships carrying 51 crewmen.
   The two bodies might have come from the missing
Panamanian-registered bulk iron ore carrier the Alexandre P, a
96,000-ton ship carrying a crew of 25, officials said.
   The bodies were those of two Asian men. They were discovered
near where a large oil slick and other debris were sighted Monday,
said a spokesman for the Sea Safety Centre in Canberra, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   A doctor aboard the oil search ship Energy Searcher, which
recovered the bodies, examined the men and found they had suffered
burns and lacerations before entering the liferaft, the spokesman
said.
   Evidence indicated their ship caught fire before sinking, the
spokesman said.
   The Alexandre P left Dampier in the north of Western Australia
state on March 13 en route to South Africa and Spain. It has failed
to make its required daily position report since March 15 and fears
are growing its cargo may have shifted and the vessel sunk.
   The Sea Safety Center spokesman said the center had not
positively identified the liferaft and bodies as being from the
Alexandre P.
   The spokesman said a separate search for a missing Japanese tuna
trawler was continuing about 500 nautical miles northwest of North
West Cape. The Dahlia II was carrying 22 Indonesian and four
Japanese crew members.
   Indonesian authorities picked up a distress call from the vessel
on Saturday, as tropical Cyclone Alex battered the area where the
Dahlia II had been fishing off the island of Java.

<DATELINE>SHERIDAN, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two funeral directors left a casket with a
body inside at a state social services office to protest government
reimbursement rates for indigent burials.
   P.J. Kane and Mark Ferries, who work with different Sheridan
funeral homes, said they meant no disrespect to the deceased. They
said the ploy was needed to get the attention of the Department of
Public Assistance and Social Services, which sets the limit for
indigent burial expenses.
   The two men left the casket at the office for two hours Friday.
   Kane said the department will pay up to $995 for the burial of
anyone who was receiving aid under the Wyoming Public Assistance
and Social Services Act. He said $995 doesn't come close to
covering the cost of a burial.
   ``We will not turn anybody away from a decent burial,'' he said,
``but, being in private business, we cannot buy a cemetery lot, pay
for burial costs and a vault out of our own pockets.''
   Many Wyoming counties cover the difference between the state
limit and the actual expense. However, Sheridan County's indigent
burial fund has apparently run dry, and county officials say there
won't be any more money coming to cover the costs.
   State social service officials, the county attorney's office and
the state attorney general's office all told the funeral directors
to file a lawsuit to get the law changed.
   The Rev. Ray Moss, who accompanied the funeral directors and the
casket to the office, said the woman whose body was in the casket
had no family in Sheridan and her estate would not cover the cost
of a burial.

<HEAD>Baker Says Democracy Fund May Be Used In South Africa</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Namibia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is considering a fund
used to aid democracy in Poland and Nicaragua to support
anti-apartheid groups in South Africa, Secretary of State James A.
Baker III said.
   In Washington, a U.S. official confirmed that the Bush
administration is seeking ways to aid the African National Congress
through the National Endowment for Democracy.
   In a briefing Sunday to reporters traveling with the secretary
to Namibia for its independence celebrations, Baker said the
endowment may be employed ``to encourage democracy, non-racial
democracy in South Africa.''
   The fund was created in 1983 and used most recently in Nicaragua
to support parties opposed to the Sandinista government. It also
financed Poland's Solidarity movement in its struggle against the
former Communist government.
   ``It's a little bit too early to tell'' how the endowment
process would work in South Africa), Baker said. He added that the
endowment itself would decide how to dispense funds in South Africa.
   A coalition of American black leaders has asked Baker to give
financial aid to the African National Congress, the main black
nationalist group fighting white-minority rule in South Africa.
Baker's suggestion of the endowment's involvement appeared to be a
response to the request to aid the ANC.
   The National Endowment for Democracy, created by Congress during
the Reagan administration, is a publicly chartered, but publicly
and privately funded organization whose leadership includes the
heads of both the Republican and Democratic parties, the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO. The group gives grants to
organizations which can further democracy in other countries.
   It also sends Americans abroad to teach democratic processes and
methods.
   Baker also said he would encourage South African President F.W.
de Klerk to continue reforms in South Africa.

<HEAD>Census Bureau Aims to Count as Many of Homeless As It Can Today</HEAD>

   They are mostly male and single. The majority
are minorities. They have little education and many have histories
of mental illness. All are homeless. And the Census Bureau aims to
count as many of them as it can today.
   ``The homeless are people and they deserve to be counted,'' the
Rev. Del Maxfield of Denver said this morning on NBC's ``Today''
show.
   Maxfield was critical of some advocates for the homeless who
have opposed the census effort. ``I think it is irresponsible of us
as service providers and as advocates for the homeless to sit back
now, after we try to keep these people in the forefront all year
long, and now tell them to go back in the shadows.''
   Mitch Snyder of Washington's Community for Creative Non-Violence
has led the anti-census effort.
   Members of Snyder's group protested in front of the Commerce
Department this morning, carrying signs saying ``Like Grains of
Sand the Homeless Can't Be Counted'' and ``You Can't Count The
Homeless.'' A pile of sand had been dumped in the street outside
the department.
   ``A number of and by itself isn't helpful ... I think it is
politically naive not to understand that coming in with a small
number is going to be misused. It's going to be used to try and
drive down appropriations,'' Snyder said on ``CBS This Morning.''
   ``I think that the politicians will do whatever they want to do
regardless of whether or not they have specific information. I
think we, as care providers and especially local government, will
do positive things with these figures...it's their (the homeless')
right as American citizens to be counted'' Chicago shelter operator
Rick Roberts said on the same broadcast.
   ``The government needs to know about everyone and this is a
chance for the homeless to say, `Look, we exist, we're part of this
country','' Cynthia Taeuber, special assistant for selected
populations at the Census Bureau, said Monday.
   Tonight and early Wednesday morning up to 15,000 census workers
will visit missions and shelters, walk the streets and look down
alleys. They will even wait outside abandoned buildings to see if
anyone emerges in the morning.
   Where possible, workers will ask some basic questions, too, but
they won't disturb sleeping people or those in no state of mind to
be interviewed.
   The plan is to take the measure of the homeless in a more
thorough count than occurred a decade ago when census workers
simply visited shelters and missions.
   Directing aid to the homeless has foundered on a lack of
knowledge, as estimates of their number vary from 250,000 to 3
million.
   Because of problems in finding all the homeless _ and concerns
about worker safety _ Taeuber admits that she expects the tally to
be conservative.
   Officials already know something about the homeless, through a
survey of 1,704 homeless people at soup kitchens in 20 cities taken
by The Urban Institute.
   The survey, with a margin of error of plus or minus three
percentage points, found that 81 percent of the homeless surveyed
were men, compared with just under half of the general population.
   About 46 percent of the homeless were black, 41 percent were
non-Hispanic whites and 10 percent were Hispanic. In the general
population, blacks make up about 12 percent and Hispanics 8 percent.
   About 55 percent of homeless had never married, compared with 22
percent of American adults overall. Fifty-two percent of all
homeless had completed high school, compared with 81 percent of all
American adults.
   Almost 20 percent of the homeless reported a history of mental
hospitalization and one-third had been patients in a detoxification
or alcohol or drug treatment center, the survey found.
   Today's $2.7 million special count involves looking for the
homeless in every city of 50,000 people or more. The Census Bureau
also asked smaller communities if they have a homeless populations.
If local officials said yes, ceusns workers will go there and make
a count.
   The bureau doesn't plan to announce a homeless population
figure. Instead, it will report that it found so many people in
shelters, so many in missions, so many in flophouses, so many
walking or sleeping on the streets, and so forth.
   From about 6 p.m. to midnight, workers will visit public and
private emergency shelters, hotels and motels used to shelter the
homeless and other hotels costing less than $12 per night.
   From 2 a.m. to 4 a.m., census workers will travel the streets,
checking places where homeless people may be found. After that,
until about 8 a.m., workers will wait outside abandoned buildings
where homeless people may live.
   Because of safety questions, the decision was made not to enter
abandoned buildings even though people may be sleeping in them,
Taeuber said.

<TEXT>
   The leading East German political party has
asked a successful West German wine merchant to become East
Germany's new economics minister.
   Elmar Pieroth urges speedily replacing East Germany's weak
currency with the mighty West German mark to spur the conversion
from centrally planned inefficiency to what he envisions as a
free-market economy and prosperity.
   The East German Christian Democratic Union, which placed first
in Sunday's elections, proposed that Pieroth serve in East
Germany's first freely elected government.
   Pieroth, 55, says he does not expect to hold an East Berlin job
for long because unity is sure to come soon.
   ``First we have to bring the economy in line with that of West
Germany. I could imagine unification of the two German states
within 12 months,'' he said.
   Pieroth is a politician in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union, sister party of the East German CDU.
   Starting in 1953, Pieroth and his brother, Kuno, headed and
expanded the family wine business in Bad Kreuznach, southwest of
Frankfurt in Rhineland-Palatinate state. He held the economics
portfolio in West Berlin's city government from 1981 until last
year.

<HEAD>Committee Approves Bill Allowing Free Travel Abroad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A parliamentary committee today approved a bill
that would allow all Soviet citizens to travel abroad freely,
sending the measure to the Supreme Soviet for debate, the official
news agency Tass said.
   Under provisions of the bill, permission will not be required
for Soviets to leave and return, either for short trips or
permanent residence abroad, Tass said.
   ``A passport for traveling abroad will be issued for a period of
five years to whoever applies for it,'' Tass said. ``The time
abroad will be determined by the citizen himself.''
   Only state security considerations, criminal proceedings or
incarceration could prevent a person from being issued a passport,
the news agency said.
   Additionaly, access to classified materials would allow the
Soviet government to deny an individual a passport for only five
years, Tass said.
   ``A citizen may lodge an appeal with any authority, up to the
U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet, against a refussal to issue a foreign
travel passport,'' Tass said.
   The bill was introduced by Fyodor Burlatsky, a Supreme Soviet
deputy and well-known political commentator, who called it ``a
major indicator of democratization in the Soviet Union.''
   Committee members said they would insist that the bill be
adopted at the current session of the Supreme Soviet legislature,
which ends in late April.
   Members also warned against delay in solving issues related to
the passport bill, including rules on exchanging money and buying
airline tickets.
   Unless flying on the state-run airline Aeroflot or its joint
ventue partner Pan Am, Soviets seeking to travel abroad must pay in
hard currency.
   Under newly introduced tourist exchange rates, a $1,000 airline
ticket would cost a Soviet traveler about 6,000 rubles on a foreign
airline. The Aeroflot and Pan Am flights are sold out for more than
a year in advance.
   Last year, 235,000 people left the country for permanent
residence abroad and that 2 million Soviets took short trips
abroad, including 300,000 travelers to the West, Burlatsky said.

<HEAD>Members Suing Union Entitled to Jury Trial if Seeking Monetary
Compensation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union members who sue their union for
allegedly denying fair representation are entitled to a jury trial
if they also seek monetary compensation, the Supreme Court ruled
today.
   ``We hold that the (Constitution's) Seventh Amendment entitles
such a plaintiff to a jury trial,'' Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote
for the court in the 6-3 decision.
   Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin
Scalia dissented.
   Lawsuits accusing unions of breaching their duty of fair
representation usually are tried before judges without juries. Such
suits generally seek to end some asserted unfair treatment or to
force a union into taking some action.
   But, ruling in a case from North Carolina last year, the 4th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said a jury trial can be demanded
when monetary compensation such as back pay is part of the relief
sought.
   Other appeals courts had ruled differently.
   Today's decision, resolving the issue, is a victory for 27 truck
drivers who in 1983 sued Local 391 of the Teamsters union.
   The lawsuit stemmed from the drivers' transfer from various
locations to the McLean Trucking Co.'s terminal in Winston-Salem,
N.C. After the transfers, the 27 were laid off and recalled on
several occasions.
   The drivers contend that McLean breached a collective-bargaining
agreement by manipulating recall procedures so it could give other
drivers preference, and that Local 391 failed to represent them
fairly in the resulting grievances.
   The suit seeks, among other things, compensatory damages for
lost wages and benefits. As a result of today's ruling, the suit
now will reach a jury.
   In a separate jury-trial decision, the court unanimously
reinstated a lawsuit by a black machinist from North Carolina who
said he was fired because of his race.
   John S. Lytle's suit also alleged that he was given an
unfavorable job reference because he had filed a discrimination
claim against his former boss.
   Today's ruling broadens the right to a jury trial in lawsuits by
those who claim their civil rights have been violated.
   Lytle was fired in 1983 by Schwitzer Turbochargers in Arden,
N.C., a subsidiary of Household Manufacturing Inc.
   He accused the company of racial bias in violation of two civil
rights laws: a 19th Century statute first used to protect freed
slaves and a 1964 law.
   A federal judge ruled for the company, and denied Lytle a jury
trial.
   The high court today said Lytle's Seventh Amendment rights were
violated.
   The cases are Chauffeurs, Teamsters and Helpers vs. Terry,
88-1719, and Lytle vs. Household Manufacturing Inc., 88-334.

<TEXT>
   Two federal agencies have put up a $100,000 reward for the
capture of the bomber responsible for the destruction of the Fort
Myers, Fla., office of the Drug Enforcement Administration.
   The explosion has prompted the DEA to alert its offices around
the country, but agents say there's only so much they can do to
protect themselves.
   The DEA and FBI, which posted the reward, haven't named a
suspect in the blast. However, the FBI has issued a nationwide
alert for Jeffrey A. Matthews, 23, a drug suspect who allegedly
threatened the DEA after he was indicted Thursday.
   ``There have been no warrants issued yet for anyone in the
explosion, but we are following some good leads,'' FBI spokesman
Brian Kenscel said Monday.
   Matthews' half-brother, John Lewis Ciganek, 22, gave himself up
Sunday in the Florida Keys and was questioned about the bombing.
The FBI spokesman refused to say what, if anything, the suspect
told agents.
   On Monday, Ciganek was arraigned in Fort Myers federal court on
the drug indictment.
   ``I just want a fair trial,'' he said after declaring himself
indigent and in need of a court-appointed attorney. He was ordered
held without bond.
   In Washington, DEA spokesman Bill Ruzzamenti said agency offices
around the world have been told about the bombing, but no new
security measures have been taken.
   ``The situation in Fort Myers is an isolated incident,'' he said.
   The agent in charge in Minneapolis, Jim Braseth, says his office
hasn't gotten any threats, nor has it stepped up security.
   In Indianapolis, David H. McDougal, the resident agent in
charge, said that while the bombing appears local, ``this just
shows that it is a war.''
   In Yakima, Wash., DEA agent in charge Robert Dreisbach said his
office had ``taken certain security precautions as a result of Fort
Myers and continuing threats to all DEA offices from
drug-trafficking organizations.'' He wouldn't elaborate.
   The bombing _ along with threats from Colombian drug dealers and
the slayings of agents around the world _ shows the agency's limits
in protecting itself, the DEA acknowledged.
   Agents probably will be more careful, Miami DEA spokesman John
Fernandes said. But he said surrounding DEA offices with armed
guards, for instance, wouldn't work.
   ``We can't shut ourselves off behind an iron wall,'' Fernandes
said. ``We work with the public.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia called on
his fellow Democrats today to embrace the conservative economic
principles he has adopted as the nation's first elected black
governor.
   ``In presidential elections, our candidates must take the plunge
into the waters of America's New Mainstream,'' Wilder said in a
speech prepared for delivery to the National Press Club. He said
Democrats should return to their heritage of opposition to high
taxes and spending and warned that they had let Republicans take
those issues away from them.
   Wilder also urged Democrats to ``stop fighting each other'' long
after primary battles are decided.
   ``We're doing the other party's dirty work for them _ and it
must stop if we are to ever again be more than mere guests at 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue,'' he said.
   Since his history-making election in November 1989, Wilder has
been one of the hottest properties in the Democratic Party, much in
demand as a speaker.
   He issued his call for unity at a party dinner in Chicago last
week and is a featured speaker on the agenda of the Democratic
Leadership Council meeting in New Orleans later this week.
   For many Democrats, Wilder represents a mainstream alternative
to Jesse Jackson, who has twice run for the party's presidential
nomination from a base of overwhelming support within the black
community.
   But during his first months as governor, Wilder's politics have
been as conservative as Jackson's are liberal.
   In his press club speech, Wilder's emphasis was on economic
development and tough anti-crime measures.
   ``I was pleased that the legislature passed an administration
supported bill calling for the death penalty in certain
drug-related murders,'' he said, also citing legislation requiring
criminal background checks for would-be buyers of automatic weapons.
   Wilder warned Democrats that they ``cannot afford to
underestimate or ignore the economic and housing needs of citizens
living beyond our cities and suburbs.
   ``Americans everywhere want to hold the line on spending and on
taxes. There was a time when Democrats were elected by campaigning
against big government and high taxes. But for too long we have let
the other party take these issues away from us _ indeed we have
allowed them to hammer us with these issues.''

<HEAD>South Carolina Court: Cocaine Users Are More Likely to Lie</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Supreme Court ruled that cocaine
possession is a crime of moral turpitude that raises questions
about a person's basic honesty.
   In its 4-1 ruling Monday, the court said a past conviction for
cocaine possession might be used in legal proceedings to imply that
a person would lie under oath.
   ``Any involvement with cocaine contributes to the destruction of
an ordered society,'' the court said in taking cocaine possession
off the short list of crimes it considers self-destructive but not
harmful to others.
   Self-destructive crimes _ including simple possession of
marijuana, bookmaking and public drunkenness _ cannot be used
against people to convince juries in future court proceedings that
they might be basically dishonest.
   The decision reversed a 1987 ruling that cocaine possession was
not a crime of moral turpitude, and it could not be used to
challenge a defendant's truthfulness on other matters.
   The change of heart on the state's high court was directly tied
to the justices' view of cocaine:
   ``The drug cocaine has torn at the very fabric of our nation,''
Associate Justice Jean Toal wrote in the majority opinion.
``Families have been ripped apart, minds have been ruined, and
lives have been lost. It is common knowledge that the drug is
highly addictive and potentially fatal.''
   Associate Justice Ernest A. Finney dissented, saying that the
same reasoning could just as accurately be applied to alcohol,
nicotine and marijuana in the hands of abusers.
   The legal point about cocaine did not affect the outcome of the
trial that brought the issue before the court. All the justices
conceded there were other reasons to question the basic honesty of
Jimmy Major, a Florence County drug dealer convicted of selling
crack and distributing the drug within a mile of a school ground in
1988.
   The court affirmed Major's conviction, overruling his claims
that a prior conviction was improperly entered into evidence.

   Lebanon's parliament convened at its
pre-civil war headquarters in downtown west Beirut today for the
first time in nearly 15 years.
   Thirty-seven of the 72 surviving deputies attended the session,
electing the unicameral legislature's 13 committees and voting a 40
percent wage increase for civil servants.
   Speaker Hussein Husseini, a Shiite Moslem, scheduled another

loyal to President Elias Hrawi.
   In another development, police said one person was wounded when
a small bomb exploded near the Carton Hotel in the Ras Beirut
district of the city's Moslem western sector late Monday.
   The meeting today was the first by parliament at its old venue
in west Beirut's Star Square since mid-1975.
   Lawmakers from various sects attended the session. About 16
mainly Maronite Christian deputies who do not feel secure in west
Beirut remain in France to stay out of the reach of renegade Gen.
Michel Aoun.
   Parliament was invited to a meeting at its old headquarters
Sept. 22, 1988, to elect a successor to President Amin Gemayel, but
a quorum could not be achieved for the presidential vote.
   A simple majority was needed to pass the bills today.
   The civil war between Christians and Moslems broke out April 13,
1975, and forced the legislature to move to a new headquarters at
Beirut's dividing Green Line to aid participation by both Moslem
and Christian deputies.
   ``The meeting at the old parliament headquarters is the first
step toward patching up differences and reuniting the nation,'' the
Moslem Voice of the Nation said in a commentary.
   Parliament returned to its old offices apparently to avoid
meeting near Aoun's hostile troops. Aoun declared the legislature
dissolved last November in an attempt to prevent the election of
Hrawi, whom Aoun considers pro-Syrian.
   Lawmakers met at a hotel in the Syrian-policed Bekaa valley town
of Chtoura Nov. 24 and elected Hrawi as president in line with an
Arab League-brokered peace plan to end the civil strife.
   Aoun, backed by the 19,000-man mainly Christian half of the
armed forces, has rejected Hrawi's election. He holds the
shell-ravaged presidential palace in suburban Baabda, east of
Beirt, the traditional home of Lebanese heads of state.
   Aoun's move forced Hrawi to establish offices in Moslem west
Beirut, policed by about 3,500 Syrian soldiers.
   Syria, which backs Hrawi, has 40,000 troops deployed in
predominantly Moslem sectors of Lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping
mandate from the 22-nation Arab League.

<HEAD>Sri Lanka to Close Israeli Diplomatic Office</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said today it will
close an Israeli mission that has been operating in Colombo since
1984 and it gave Israeli officials one month to leave.
   Sri Lanka severed diplomatic relations with Israel after the
1967 Arab-Israeli war.
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa's predecessor, Junius R.
Jayewardene, invited the Israeli government to open an interest
section in 1984 because Israel provided military and intelligence
assistance to help against a Tamil secessionist campaign.
   Jayewardene's decision was criticized by Arab nations and
members of the non-aligned movement, but he defended the action by
saying Israel was the only country that responded to his appeal for
aid.
   Today's statement said Premadasa's decision to close the Israeli
office was the fulfillment of an election promise made before he
took office 14 months ago.
   Sri Lanka will resume diplomatic relations with Israel once
``she recognizes the Palestine Liberation Organization as the
legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, withdraws from
all occupied Palestinian territory and agrees to participate in an
international conference on the middle east convened by the U.N.,''
the statement said.
   Ori Noy, head of the Israeli Interest Section in Colombo, could
not be reached for comment.
   The interest section operated under the auspices of the U.S.
Embassy. A U.S. Embassy official refused to comment on the closure
order.
   An interest section, which operates under the flag of another
country, is a step below full diplomatic relations.
   After the Israeli Interest Section was set up, Israel sent
agricultural experts to help in northcentral Sri Lanka. Scores of
Sri Lankan soldiers, maimed in the Tamil insurrection, were sent to
Israel to be fitted with artificial limbs.
   Tamils, who make up 18 percent of the population, began fighting
in 1983, alleging discrimination by the majority Sinhalese who
control the government and the military. Sinhalese make up 75
percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people.
   Some Tamil guerrillas have acknowledged receiving support from
PLO groups, especially in the early days of the revolt.

<HEAD>Dutch Negotiate Return of Art Collection From Soviet Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Dutch government is
negotiating for the return of hundreds of art works that ended up
in Moscow museums after they were sold illegally to the Nazis in
World War II, officials said today.
   The art works, worth between an estimated $79 million to $105
million, are part of the Konigs Collection of 2,200 drawings by old
masters such as Rembrandt van Rijn, Peter Paul Rubens, Titian,
Tintoretto, and Albrecht Durer. The works disappeared during the
wartime occupation of the Netherlands.
   ``We have strong indications that about 500 drawings have been
stored in the Pushkin Museum (in Moscow) and the Hermitage (in
Leningrad),'' said Koos de Jong of the Netherlands Office for Fine
Arts, a government agency charged with care of the Dutch state's
huge art collections.
   ``We have asked the Soviet authorities to cooperate with us in
locating the collection and in returning it to the Netherlands,''
De Jong said.
   De Jong said that the Soviet Union has expressed willingness to
return the drawings to the Netherlands, from where they were taken
in 1941 by German scouts. During World War II, many art works were
taken from occupied Europe for the private collections of Third
Reich leaders.
   The drawings were sold to German buyers by the Rotterdam's
Boymans Van Beuningen museum, De Jong said, adding it was unknown
whether it had been a forcible sale.
   The museum acquired the full collection from a Dutch bank that
liquidated in the months before World War II. The bank had bought
the 2,200 drawings from Dutch financier A. Konigs when he ran into
financial trouble in 1931.
   The drawings sold to the Germans ended up in a museum in Dresden
and presumably were taken from there in 1945 by Soviet occupying
forces, De Jong said.
   Under a declaration signed by the four wartime allies, all
transactions with the Nazi government were voided, De Jong said.
``We base our claim on that declaration,'' he said, adding that he
hoped the art would be returned to the Boymans Van Beuningen museum
``tomorrow ... but it could also take decades from now.''

   A bad-check suspect riding in the back of
a police car pulled out a concealed handgun, shot at a patrolman
and then held off officers for 1{ hours, threatening suicide.
   Billy Ray Youngblood, 38, of Muskegon, was being taken to police
headquarters Monday afternoon when he pulled the .25-caliber
semiautomatic from a handbag, police Lt. Dan Stout said.
   Youngblood demanded that Patrolman Louis Hood drive him to the
Muskegon suburb of Norton Shores, but the officer escaped, Stout
said.
   As Hood fled, Youngblood fired a shot through the cruiser's rear
side window. The shattering glass and metal fragments injured Hood,
who was treated for cuts and released from Hackley Hospital,
according to Beth Taylor, an emergency room clerk.
   During the standoff that followed, Youngblood threatened suicide
by pointing the gun into his mouth. The standoff ended when Police
Chief Thomas Kelenske from nearby Roosevelt Park persuaded
Youngblood to surrender.
   The incident began shortly after noon when police were called to
the Harbor Hilton Hotel on a bad-check complaint, Stout said.
   ``Apparently, the suspect had a handbag with him and the officer
hadn't searched him well enough before putting him in the
cruiser,'' Stout said.
   Stout said Youngblood was being held in Muskegon County Jail
pending arraignment on an attempted murder charge.

   Investigators looked for clues today
in the wreckage of an apartment where a shoebox-sized package bomb
killed a man who had just moved to Florida a week before.
   The victim, 70-year-old Sherwin William Finlay, was returning to
his apartment late Monday with his wife and daughter when the blast
occurred at about 8 p.m.
   The family stepped over the package in front of the apartment
and went inside their first-floor apartment, authorities said.
   ``He came back (out), picked it up and it exploded,'' said
police spokesman Steve Weintraub.
   According to witnesses, the package resembled a shoebox and was
wrapped in brown paper. It apparently was not sent through the
mail, Weintraub said, adding ``you can't tell _ there's no package
left.''
   The blast was powerful enough to blow out the roof overhang of
the two-story apartment building, Weintraub said.
   Willi Ellison, agent in charge of the Jacksonville office of the
U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said the bomb was
``more or less a homemade device.''
   He said the remains of the device would be sent to the ATF
laboratory in Atlanta for analysis.
   Investigators do not believe the explosion is related to recent
mail bombings in Alabama, Georgia and Jacksonville, which led to
two deaths.
   ``At this point, I don't think there is a connection but we're
looking into all aspects,'' Ellison said.
   Authorities knew of no suspects or motive for the bombing. The
FBI was investigating but had no comment late Monday.
   Finlay's wife, Dorothy, 67, and 35-year-old daughter Gay Lynn
Meek were not injured. The daughter was from Illinois, said
Ellison. He said the Finlays were from Missouri, but he didn't know
exactly where.
   ``They've been here since Dec. 1,'' said Weintraub. ``I don't
know if they're down here to see if they wanted to live here or
what.''
   According to the yearbook of the Missouri Highway Department,
Finlay was a highway engineer from Gravois Mills, Mo., who retired
10 years ago.
   The family reportedly moved into the apartment complex about a
week ago and neighbors knew little about them.
   Philip Brown, who lived in a nearby apartment, said he was in
his living room when he heard the blast.
   ``I ran outside and all I could see was smoke,'' he said.
``That's when I saw someone lying under the stairs and heard a
woman screaming.''

<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign leaders and diplomats streamed
into Windhoek today, transforming the sleepy city into a
mini-United Nations as Namibia counted down the final hours before
independence.
   Seventy-five years of South African rule was to end with a
speech by South African President F.W. de Klerk before the South
African flag was lowered for the last time and replaced by the red,
green and blue banner of a new nation.
   U.N. Secretary General Perez de Cuellar was to swear in former
resistance leader Sam Nujoma as Namibia's first president, marking
the midnight transition of Africa's last colony into its youngest
state.
   ``This is a great time. It means we have freedom. We are going
to celebrate all night,'' said Nicholas van Wyk, 21, a hotel worker.
   Nujoma's South-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) had
waged a 23-year war to oust the South Africans, who captured the
former German colony on Africa's south-west coast during World War
I.
   In December 1989, South Africa agreed to grant the huge, arid
territory of 1.3 million people independence under a regional peace
plan that also calls for Cuba to withdraw its 50,000 soldiers from
neighboring Angola by mid-1991.
   In November, SWAPO captured 57 percent of the vote in free
elections.
   Representatives of dozens of nations attending today's
celebrations were also using the occasion for some
behind-the-scenes consultations, with the United States, Soviet
Union and others holding an elaborate series of meetings.
   Among the foreign guests attending the celebrations were U.S.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze; Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak; Libyan
President Moammar Gadhafi; the leaders of at least 10 African
nations; and the foreign ministers of Britain, West Germany,
Romania, Indonesia and other nations.
   Shops and main streets were festooned with Namibian flags as
workers put final touches on podiums, banners and other
decorations. Excited youngsters put up flags and decorated walls
with murals depicting peace and prosperity in the new nation.
   Tens of thousands of Namibians were expected to take part in the
celebrations, which include fireworks, choirs and traditional
dancing that was likely to last through the night.
   A parade through downtown Windhoek was expected to draw some
50,000 people Wednesday morning.
   Shevardnadze told Nujoma that gaining independence was just the
first challenge facing the new nation, and that Namibia would have
to work hard to avoid problems confronting other African nations.
   ``The main work lies ahead. We all know from experience, and
especially in fellow African states, that there is often a more
difficult struggle in development than in working toward
independence,'' he said on his arrival.
   South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a leading anti-apartheid
activist, said he hoped Namibian independence would help speed the
end of apartheid in South Africa.
   ``It is exciting to be here in Namibia at this period in time.
It means a lot to us that a country can achieve independence in the
face of such elements against them,'' he said.
   Many Namibians expressed hope that the new nation would solve
past racial differences and overcome the economic and political
problems facing many poor African nations.
   ``Other African countries have had disappointments after
independence. I hope we have learned from those economic and
political mistakes,'' said Simon Ekanjo, a student.
   Some in the white minority expressed concern about the new black
government, but said they wanted to support the new nation.
   Said Barney van der Schynn, a 41-year-old businessman, ``The
economy could suffer and changes aren't easy, but we couldn't keep
carrying on the way we were. Independence should have come
earlier.''
   Security for visiting guests was tight with police blocking off
streets around the hotels where foreign delegations were staying.
Windhoek's modest airport was thronged with police and security
officers as officials prepared for the arrival of about 100 planes
bearing guests.
   Sirens began wailing at dawn today as motorcades transported
visiting leaders and diplomats across Windhoek.
   Baker had six separate meetings planned today, including talks
with Perez de Cuellar and Shevardnadze.
   Among other issues, Baker and Shevardnadze expected to discuss a
peace plan for Angola, which has suffered 15 years of civil war
between the Soviet-backed Marxist government and U.S.-supported
insurgents.
   The independence date was chosen to mark the 30th anniversary of
the ``Sharpeville Massacre,'' when 69 unarmed demonstrators were
shot to death in South Africa while protesting apartheid laws in a
black township south of Johannesburg.
   ``The day was chosen as a sign of solidarity not only for the
people of Namibia, but also with the people of South Africa,'' said
Hifikepunye Pohamba, a SWAPO member who will become the home
affairs minister in the new government.
   Namibia for decades has had the same apartheid laws of racial
segregtion as South Africa, although most were scrapped in recent
years.

<TEXT>
   The Seabrook nuclear power plant's reactor
began operating early today, five days after receiving an operating
license.
   A sustained atomic reaction in the plant's uranium fuel began at
3:59 a.m., spokesman Ron Sher said. The first sustained chain
reaction at the plant was during low-power testing last year.
   Sher said the plant will increase power to 100 percent over the
next two to three months. Seabrook will begin to produce limited
amounts of electricity at about 10 percent of full power, he said.
   The $6.5 billion plant, finished in mid-1986, got its Nuclear
Regulatory Commission operating license Thursday, following lengthy
regulatory battles and a preliminary court skirmish decided in
Seabrook's favor.
   The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington declined last week to
block the license pending further court action, but still has
before it an appeal filed by the plant's opponents.

<TEXT>
   President Bush urged congressional leaders
today to enact his $800 million aid package for Panama and
Nicaragua, saying it would help increase pressure for democracy in
Fidel Castro's Cuba.
   Bush, speaking at the outset of a White House meeting with the
House and Senate leadership, said, ``I'm terribly disappointed that
Castro seems to be firming up his totalitarian position instead of
moving toward free and fair elections.''
   ``I'd like to see him shift from that highly militarized island
and let democracy have a chance,'' said Bush. ``I think if we are
helpful to Nicaragua and Panama, it will simply increase the
pressure in that marvelous island of Cuba for change.''
   Bush is pressing for passage of $500 million to help Panama
rebuild following the ouster of Manuel Antonio Noriega, and $300
million for Nicaragua, where citizens last month voted to replace
Sandinista President Daniel Ortega with publisher Violeta Chamorro,
who is strongly backed by the United States.
   Bush, addressing the congressional leaders and top
administration officials gathered in the Cabinet Room, said he
called the meeting to discuss the ``dramatic'' shifts toward
democracy in Panama and Nicaragua.
   ``I know that the Senate and the House will come to grips with
this problem,'' said Bush.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley said after the meeting, ``We're going
to do whatever we can to expedite this process'' of enacting the
aid package, but it may take ``a few weeks.''
   With last week's ouster of a military ruler in Haiti, the United
States regards Cuba as the sole holdout against democracy in the
Western Hemisphere.
   Bush, in an interview Monday with Media General newspapers,
criticized Castro for keeping some troops in Africa and for human
rights abuses in Cuba.
   Asked what Castro could do to secure normal relations with the
United States, Bush said, ``I think free and fair elections and a
recognition of the democratic changes taking place, and a shifting
from a highly militarized island to something that would be more
helpful to his own people.''
   He also called for economic changes, including shifting the
highly socialized Cuban economy to market forces.
   He said Castro was ``digging himself in further, almost in
splendid isolation, against the changes that are taking place
around the world.''
   Several lawmakers said the real pressure on Castro is emanating
not from the White House, but from the dramatic changes elsewhere
in Central America and Eastern Europe.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said, ``Cuba is being squeezed by
world events. ... Just like we've seen in Eastern Europe, I think
change is inevitable in Cuba no matter what we do.''
   Leahy, chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that
dispenses foreign aid, also questioned the importance of Cuba.
   ``We should be helping to stabilize and encourage the emerging
democracies in Eastern Europe. ... Cuba is interesting to us
because it's 90 miles offshore. But does it really involve the
strategic interest of the United States?'' Leahy said. ``It's a
tiny little island country.''
   Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., the House Republican whip, said,
``Castro is ... a man who is denying the reality of history.''
   ``We're not getting any tougher with Castro. We're staying where
we are and hoping that Castro will decide to allow the people of
Cuba to choose freely,'' said Gingrich.

   A conservative abortion foe and a pro-choice
moderate squared off today in Illinois' Republican gubernatorial
primary, while Democratic Reps. Gus Savage and Sidney Yates faced
spirited challenges in their Chicago districts.
   State officials predicted about a quarter of Illinois' 6 million
registered voters would cast ballots.
   A larger share of Chicago's 1.4 million registered voters was
expected to turn out, largely because of an intense four-way
Democratic primary contest for the powerful presidency of the Cook
County Board.
   Early indications were that voter turnout was running according
to projections.
   At 7 a.m., when polls had been open an hour, turnout was running
at a rate of about 25 percent in suburban Cook county, according to
the county clerk's office. Shortly before noon it was calculated at
43 percent in the city.
   Today also is Election Day in two New York City congressional
districts with vacant seats. Republican City Council member Susan
Molinari is expected to win the seat vacated by her father, Guy
Molinari, who represented Staten Island until he quit to become
borough president. Democratic Assemblyman Jose Serrano is favored
to take the Bronx seat of Robert Garcia, who has been sentenced to
prison for extorting payoffs in the Wedtech scandal.
   In the Republican race for the Illinois governor's nomination,
two-term Secretary of State Jim Edgar _ who has led in the polls _
warned against complacency among his supporters, whom he billed as
the real Republicans.
   ``We need to make sure that Republicans decide the Republican
nomination for governor,'' Edgar said Monday at a Springfield
rally, where he pledged to control state spending.
   Moderate temperatures today disappointed Edgar's opponent,
conservative political organizer Steven Baer. He said at a
Springfield campaign stop that he hoped for ``sub-zero weather'' to
bolster his longshot campaign.
   ``The pro-life supporters will go to the polls anyway,'' said
Baer, who has attacked Edgar for supporting abortion rights and
extension of a temporary 20 percent state income-tax increase.
   State Attorney General Neil Hartigan, unopposed in the
Democratic primary, faces the GOP winner in November. Four-term
Republican Gov. James R. Thompson is not seeking re-election.
   Edgar has the support of President Bush and GOP National
Chairman Lee Atwater, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
Monday.
   A third GOP gubernatorial candidate, Dr. Robert Marshall of Burr
Ridge, has ran a low-profile campaign.
   Age has been an issue in the challenge to 40-year House veteran
Yates, 80, by first-term Chicago Alderman Edwin Eisendrath, 32, in
the 9th Congressional District on the North Side and in some north
suburbs.
   Yates complained Eisendrath had maligned him with a campaign
pamphlet that ranked Yates with an antique typewriter and a vintage
car.
   ``What I've said is he doesn't have the experience for the
job,'' Yates said.
   Eisendrath contended Yates is just out of touch.
   ``Sid Yates is no Claude Pepper,'' he added, referring to the
late Florida Democrat, a congressional champion of elderly rights.
   Savage, a 10-year House member from the predominantly black 2nd
District, used a weekend rally to say his main challenger, educator
and Rhodes Scholar Melvin Reynolds, 38, is taking money from
pro-Israel donors outside the district.
   At a commuter-station campaign stop Monday, Reynolds said Savage
wasn't focusing on issues.
   ``In the shuffle, it's clear that people lose out,'' he said.
   Only two other incumbents faced challenges in Illinois' 22 U.S.
House districts _ Chicago Democrats Charles Hayes in the 1st and
Cardiss Collins in the 7th.
   The top Cook County job opened up for the first time in 21 years
when George W. Dunne, 76, announced he was retiring.
   There was intense last-minute campaigning by front-runners
Richard Phelan, special counsel in the House ethics committee's
investigation of former House Speaker Jim Wright, and Eugene
Pincham, a former state appellate judge.
   Also seeking the Democratic nomination were Cook County Clerk
Stanley Kusper and the party's endorsed candidate, state Sen. Ted
Lechowicz, who placed third in a late poll.
   U.S. Sen. Paul Simon and his Republican challenger, U.S. Rep.
Lynn Martin, were unopposed in their primaries.
   Two Republicans and four Democrats were seeking nominations to
Martin's 16th Congressional District seat in northwestern Illinois.

<HEAD>Parliament Approves Tough Money Laundering Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERN, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament has approved a law that
makes money laundering a crime punishable by fines of up to
$666,000 and five years imprisonment.
   The legislation, which takes effect July 1, was approved by the
upper house Council of States late Monday and was hailed by a
deputy as an international pace-setter. The National Council, or
lower house, adopted the measure last November. Both votes were
unanimous.
   Professionals in the financial sector who fail to exercise ``due
care'' in obtaining the identification of customers risk drawing
unspecified fines or terms of up to one year in jail.
   Rene Rhinow, head of the commission that wrote the bill, told
the Council of States that the law would give Switzerland a leading
position in the fight against organized crime.
   Justice Minister Arnold Koller said the government was examining
measures that would require people crossing into Switzerland with
large amounts of cash to declare the money to customs. He said this
may involve amounts between $33,300 and $66,600.
   Switzerland has been rocked by several money laundering cases in
the past two years. Last November, a parliamentary commission
criticized prosecuting authorities for not doing enough to fight
international crime, including the drugs and arms trade.
   Under the Swiss system, possible opponents of the law now have
three months to seek a national referendum by collecting at least
50,000 signatures. Barring such move, which is not expected, the
law would enter into force July 1.

   President Bush said today he hopes the
breakaway republic of Lithuania will experience peaceful change and
self-determination.
   Bush was asked by reporters at the outset of a meeting with
congressional leaders if he was concerned that President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev might order a military crackdown on the breakaway
republic.
   ``I'm glad that they're still talking peaceful change. That's
essential,'' Bush said. ``That's what everybody wants to see is
peaceful evolution in Lithuania.
   ``We want to see democracy and freedom. We want to see
self-determination and we also want to see peacful evolution, and
that is in the interest of Eastern Europe as they begin to solidify
their democracy,'' said Bush, who is welcoming the new
non-communist prime minister of Poland, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, to the
White House on Wednesday.
   After the meeting, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash.,
praised Bush's response to the Lithuanian independence movement.
   ``I think the president's approaching that matter with caution
and discretion,'' he said. ``I think the president and the United
States has made it clear that we expect the Soviets to hold to
their promise not to use force with reference to Eastern Europe or
with reference to the Balkan states.''
   Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., the House minority whip, said it
would be ``utterly stupid'' for Bush to be lecturing Gorbachev in
public about what to do on Lithuania.
   ``The United States has never recognized the Soviet conquest of
Lithuania. ... I presume that we are prepared to help those folks,
but that we also recognize that militarily they're only going to
become as free as the Russian military and the Soviet government
permit,'' said Gingrich, a leading conservative.
   ``If the Soviets decide on force, if they decide on military
occupation, then there is plenty of time to react. But as long as
you have a hope that ... Gorbachev is genuinely maneuvering to find
a way to accommodate Lithuanian desires without destroying the
Soviet Union, I think it's prudent for us to be a little calm and a
little patient.
   ``This guy's been amazing so far,'' Gingrich said. ``And I don't
think we ought to try to pretend either that we have the military
power to force anything or that we are dramatically smarter than
the Lithuanians and Russians.''
   The United States has urged the Soviet Union to respect the will
of the Lithuanian people, but it has not formally recognized the
breakaway republic. It says it will delay a decision on recognition
until the new government in Lithuania establishes control over its
territory.
   The Soviet government warned Lithuania Monday not to erect
customs posts, introduce its own currency or take over Moscow-run
factories without Kremlin permission.
   The televised announcement did not say what would happen if
Lithuania ignored the warning, but Soviet troops in the past day
have carried out military maneuvers in the republic that
Lithuanians say are aimed at intimidation.
   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis denied that his Baltic
republic plans to seize state enterprises and sell them to private
owners, and called the harsh warning from Moscow a negotiating ploy.

<HEAD>Dearborn School Apologizes for Survey of Arab Stereotypes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A survey meant to assess high school
students' attitudes toward Arab-Americans did more to inspire
negative images than battle them, critics said.
   The survey was developed by teacher Ron Webb and 13 students in
his advanced journalism class at Dearborn High School.
   Among other things, it asked non-Arab students whether they
thought Arabs dealt drugs, had poor hygiene habits or avoided taxes.
   School officials issued a letter of apology Monday following an
outcry from Arab-American students, parents and community leaders.
   ``We are disappointed with ourselves that, in attempting to
measure anti-Arabic prejudice among non-Arabic students at Dearborn
High School, we inadvertently insulted those whose problems ... we
were attempting to expose, deal with and rectify,'' Principal Ann
Superko wrote.
   The questions created tensions that hadn't existed at the
school, where 10 percent of the 1,000 students are Arab-American.
   ``The survey didn't give them any chance to say good things,''
said freshman Ali Chami.
   ``Arabs don't pay taxes? We paid $4,600 in property taxes. I do
not want to walk around the rest of my life apologizing for being
Arabic,'' said Chami's mother, Fay, a Lebanese-American.
   Webb said he received threatening phone calls after the survey
was distributed last week. He canceled an edition of the school
newspaper that was to have reported its results.
   ``I didn't want to insult anybody,'' he said. ``That's the last
thing I wanted to do.''

<HEAD>30 Anti-Abortion Protesters Invade Hospital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LILLE, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 30 anti-abortion protesters were led
away by police Tuesday after forcing their way into the operating
section of a hospital where abortions are performed.
   About half the protesters shut themselves inside an operating
room of Huriez hospital and wrote anti-abortion graffiti on the
walls while their comrades blocked the entrance to the room.
   After more than two hours, police removed the protesters and
took them to a police station in the northern industrial city. They
later were released, but hospital officials said they planned to
file charges of vandalism.
   The officials said surgery had to be postponed because the
protest required the operating room to be sterilized again.
   Abortion has been legal in France since 1975 despite opposition
from the country's powerful Roman Catholic Church. Anti-abortion
groups have been active politically, but there have been few
previous incidents involving forced entry into hospitals,
harassment of abortion recipients, or other aggressive tactics such
as those used by some anti-abortion activists in the United States.

<HEAD>Premier Says Hard-Line Policies Needed to Maintain Stability</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLENE L. FU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Li Peng on Tuesday reaffirmed China's
hard-line policies stemming from last year's crushing of the
pro-democracy movement, attacking Western ideas and praising the
superiority of socialsm.
   ``As we confront pressure from abroad and difficulties at home,
preservation of the country's stability is a matter of paramount
importance,'' Li said in a state of the nation address to open
China's annual legislative session.
   Li stressed the importance of maintaining correct ideology to
combat ``bourgeois liberalism,'' or Western ideas, and the need for
more central planning and control of the economy.
   ``A trend toward bourgeois-liberalization thinking had run
rampant during previous years,'' he told the 2,705 delegates to the
National People's Congress. But, he said, ``importance has been
attached afresh to ideological and political work.''
   Li noted the ``soul-stirring struggles'' of 1989, including the
victory over the ``counterrevolutionary rebellion'' _ the
government's term for the student-led pro-democracy movement
crushed by military force in June. Hundreds and perhaps thousands
of people were killed in the crackdown.
   He said the pro-democracy movement was led by hostile forces
trying to turn China into a bourgeois republic dependent on
capitalist countries.
   In contrast to recent developments in the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe, Li proclaimed that ``come what may, socialist China
will stand rock firm in the East'' and reaffirmed the leading role
of the Communist Party.
   ``Upholding socialism is inseparable from upholding leadership
by the party,'' he said, equating it with national stability and
unity.
   Li said class struggle would continue for a long time ``and may
even become acute under certain condition.'' He called for
``intensive education,'' especially of young people, in ideology
and political thought.
   ``It is essential to distinguish clearly between socialist
democracy and bourgeois democracy,'' he said. ``We must ...
maintain sharp vigilance and resolutely combat this corrosive trend
of thought.''
   There was little response from the floor as Li droned through
the 59-page, 2{-hour speech, raising his voice at a few key points
to elicit applause. A few delegates clearly had fallen asleep,
chins propped on chests, while other struggled to stay awake,
wiping their faces with wet towels, yawning and rubbing their eyes.
   Behind Li on the podium, China's aged leadership held whispered
conversations with each other during the speech.
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping was missing from the rostrum, his
seat conspicuously empty beside party chief Jiang Zemin.
   Zhao Ziyan, Jiang's predecessor who was purged from all party
posts last summer after being accused of supporting the student-led
democracy movement, also was missing. Zhao is a deputy from Sichuan
province and reportedly had asked for leave from the congress.
   Much of Li's speech was devoted to China's struggling economy,
which flourished and then overheated under Deng's economic reforms
of the past decade. Li imposed tough austerity measures in 1988 to
combat excessive growth and runaway inflation.
   He reported that those measures had cut the inflation rate to 7
percent from 30 percent a year ago, and brought economic growth to
a manageable level, but said many problems, including stockpiling,
rising debt and factory closures remain.
   ``We must not look for quick success in either economic
development or reform. Similarly, we must not look for quick
success in current economic improvement and rectification,'' Li
said.
   He announced some austerity measures would be eased, including
relaxing curbs on the money supply, increasing loans to
enterprises, adjusting interest rates for loans and savings
deposits, and increasing investment in housing and key industries.
   Several times, Li said economic reforms would continue, but he
also called for more state control on prices and money markets,
construction projects and distribution of valuable materials rather
than allowing market forces to rule.
   Li stressed the reforms are ``designed to demonstrate the
superiority of the socialist system.''
   One of Li's final points was that a ``clean and honest''
government that has the faith and respect of the masses was needed
to achieve the goals set forth in his report.
   Corruption and bureaucracy has been a major complaint of the
Chinese people and was one of the rallying cries of last year's
democracy movement.

<HEAD>Gadhafi Calls For Moslem Boycott Of U.S., Britain, West Germany</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi today urged a
Moslem economic boycott against the United States, Britain and West
Germany and said no Islamic country should have diplomatic ties
with those nations.
   Libya has said it suspects the United States, Israel and West
Germany are behind last Wednesday's fire at a Libyan plant that
allegedly produced poison gas. The three countries have denied any
involvement.
   Gadhafi's remarks, carried by the official Libyan news agency
JANA and monitored in Rome, made no mention of the fire. But the
report said Gadhafi accused the United States and its allies of
conducting a campaign of subversion against Islamic countries.
   It quoted Gadhafi as saying that any peace with the United
States is deception and hypocrisy. He also said there should be no
U.S., British or West German embassies in any Islamic state.
   Libya has diplomatic relations with West Germany, but the United
States and Britain severed ties with Libya years ago.
   Gadhafi was quoted as saying the Moslem world is facing a
historic struggle with a ``hostile satanic force'' and that ``no
Islamic country should establish relations with the U.S. government
and its allies. Rather, we should have a decisive and perpetual
boycott against them.''
   Libya contends the plant near Rabta, about 60 miles southwest of
Tripoli, produced pharmaceuticals, but the United States and West
Germany say it produced poison gas.
   Libya's ambassador to Italy, Rahman Shalgam, told Italian
journalists in Rome Monday that several people suspected of causing
the fire had been detained. He also said a ``member of the
technical staff'' apparently set the fire, which he said caused
``damage of great proportions.''
   U.S. officials say the plant is now inoperable.
   JANA quoted Gadhafi as saying no ship or plane from the United
States, Britain or West Germany should be allowed in ``the land of
Islam.'' He appealed to Islamic countries to ``boycott completely
the forces of evil on this planet.''
   The United States attacked Libyan targets three times in the
1980s, twice shooting down Libyan fighter planes and in 1986
bombing Tripoli and Benghazi to retaliate for what it called
Libya's support of international terrorism.
   Some of the U.S. warplanes that attacked Libya in 1986 came from
bases in Britain.
   Britain broke diplomatic ties with Libya in April 1984 after a
London policewoman was shot to death during a Libyan dissident
demonstration. Britain said she was killed by a Libyan firing from
inside the Libyan embassy.
   President Reagan ordered economic sanctions against Libya in
January 1986. President Bush, citing Libya's continued support for
terrorism, extended those sanctions last Jan. 4.

<HEAD>Lovely Ethnic Styles Look Sexy at Ungaro</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUZY PATTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Fashion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emanuel Ungaro's luxury ready-to-wear show Tuesday
did more for the rich peasant look from the East than anybody since
Yves Saint Laurent brought out folklore from the steppes in 1976.
   And Ungaro made it sexy in a Parisian way that only master
tailor and colorist could pull off. It was his best ready-to-wear
show in many seasons.
   Everything was there in an up-to-date melding of East and West.
Ungaro took flower-printed long velvet skirts and topped them with
shimmery lame blouses or flowered vests and rich, quilted velvet
short jackets and Russian army hats or pillboxes with tassels.
   Color ran riot in this show that had plenty of sophisticated
smooth-wool daytime suits with bicolor waist-fitted tops, in
eye-catching shades like violet, carmine or peacock with charcoal,
emphasizing feminine curves.
   But the sexy message was there, this time in good taste. A
voluptuous model looked fancy but fetching in a decollete silk
jersey blouse and wrapped flowered satin long high-waisted skirt
ornamented by a bright pink taffeta bow and jeweled pin.
   The skirt was split to show plenty of leg. The whole thing was
topped by a royal blue taffeta-lined multicolored velvet jacket.
   Ungaro used loads of metallic soft leathers in brief minis,
sleek long pants, quilted anoraks. But he also mixed these up with
colorful printed silk velvets, satin tunics, throwing in
beautifully cut checked suits and straight pants.
   His lame-shot silk print chiffon blouses will be coveted by
anybody with a yearning to shimmer and shine, at any time of day. A
new fashion message beaming from Paris: it's OK to look fairly
glitzy even for lunch, as long as you do it tastefully.
   Part of Ungaro's new exuberance was high, knee-covering boots
worn with the minis, the most sensational in flowered prints and
brocades.
   The glory of this collection was that one can choose. Pile on
the opulence to flaunt it, or pare things down to the Ungaro
details _ all excellent.
   Even the ``little black dress,'' a strapless short sheath, was
perfectly dressed up by strands of pearls and cabochon stones,
topped by an airy black organza shrug.
   At Guy Laroche, the boutique-line designer Guy Douvier got all
the trends right in an upbeat collection full of the current colors
and silhouettes.
   While Ungaro's ``Parallele'' line is expensive, a suit upward of
$2,000 or more, the somewhat simpler but still fashionable Laroche
offerings are well-made, and cost about half as much.
   He went in for flaring shortie coats, the mohair versions
looking great with important patch pockets in primary colors or
more subtle shades of vanilla, coral or violet.
   In the sporty lines, Douvier showed good long cable-knit
collegiate pullovers or silver-buttoned cardigans over tiny tweed
minis. There were also great tricolor knit dresses topped by
black-edged shawls.
   Laroche offered the currently trendy bright quilted duffels. For
evening, the gold versions opened up to reveal sexy split-skirt
outfits or a wonderful brown and lame pleated lace cocktail dress.
   One classic but novel trouser outfit here teamed an apple-green
bolero and jersey pullover with narrow khaki suede pants and a
fringed violet and yellow shawl printed with a wild-animal pattern.
   Both Ungaro and Laroche showed versions of puffy iridescent
bubble short evening dresses but they somehow looked a bit passe
compared with the slinkier gowns split up the leg.
   Laroche brought out some nice short minks and fur-lined suede
duffel coats.
   Frederic Castet, for 20 years the fur designer at Dior,
displayed his fur-lined fashions in his runway debut. He will open
a shop on the rue Bassano, in the fashion area known as the
``golden triangle'' near the Champs-Elysees, celebrating the event
with golden triangle adornments on belts and sunflower motifs
appliqued on silk blouses.
   Besides the most sumptuous duffels, parkas and swirly pyramid
minks in natural or dyed ruby or indigo shades, chinchilla, fox and
fisher, Castet also brought out a beautiful new fake fur in woven
silk called ``Castiss.''
   It's a dead-ringer for sheared mink or beaver, and looks fine as
duffels, parkas, or taffeta raincoat linings.
   Valentino brought out his usual impeccably cut outfits, often
featuring a new look in tiny ``Fortuny'' or crystal pleating all
over dresses in flounces or palazzo pants.
   He piled on satin, lace and gold-leaf appliques for an opulent
effect.

<TEXT>
   A man who was acquitted in 1986 of molesting
his young daughter was awarded more than $5 million in damages for
being defamed by members of the audience at Geraldo Rivera's talk
show.
   U.S. District Court Judge Maryanne Trump Barry on Monday entered
a default judgment granting Lawrence Spiegel $1 million in special
damages and $4 million in punitive damages.
   Spiegel's attorney, Stephen Haft, said Faye Yeager of Atlanta
and Lydia Rayner of Gulfport, Miss., defendants in the 1988 federal
slander suit, failed to file answers or appear at Monday's hearing.
   Haft said his client was a guest on the nationally televised
show in 1988 when the defendants _ wearing wigs and sunglasses _
began berating Spiegel from the audience.
   He said the women, who are associated with the national group
Mothers Against Raping Children, had previously harassed Spiegel
during a speaking engagement in California.
   Spiegel was indicted in December 1983 on charges of molesting
his then-2-year-old daughter. He was cleared of the charges in
January 1986.
   ``If nothing else, I hope this sends the message that I will not
be a punching bag for anyone,'' Spiegel, a psychologist from
Parsippany-Troy Hills, said of the judge's decision.
   There were no telephone listings for Ms. Yeager in Atlanta or
for Ms. Rayner in Gulfport.

   Supporters of democratic reform won victories
across the Soviet Union, defeating old-guard Communists in runoff
elections in the Slavic heartland and choosing independence
activists in the Baltic republics.
   In Latvia, the People's Front claimed victory Monday in the
republic's first free elections in 50 years, and a spokesman said
the group came close to achieving the parliamentary majority needed
to press for independence.
   In Estonia, pro-independence parties won at least 54 of the 105
seats in the republic's new parliament.
   Activists in Latvia and Estonia had hoped Sunday's parliamentary
elections in the Baltics _ annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 _
would follow the lead of nearby Lithuania and bring independence
supporters to power.
   But a spokesman for the Latvian opposition group, Kristian
Rozenvald, said the People's Front will probably gain a majority in
the next election round in April.
   The victories of the popular movements were a blow to President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's efforts to slow their drives for
independence. He has repeatedly condemned ``separatists'' and has
refused to recognize Lithuania's self-proclaimed independence.
   Reformers also claimed victories in crucial runoffs Sunday in
Russia, Byelorussia and the Ukraine. The Soviet Union's Slavic
heartland accounts for 80 percent of the country's territory and
two-thirds of its population. The reformers unseated local
Communist officials who have been accused of blocking reforms
advocated by Gorbachev.
   There were no immediate results from most towns in Russia, or
from the Ukraine, and official tallies were not expected for
several days.
   In Estonia, the Estonian People's Front won at least 38 of the
105 seats in the republic's new parliament, said Rina Lohmus, a
correspondent for Estonian Radio.
   The radio said the Estonian Committee, a more radical
independence group won at least 16 seats, and deputies from several
small parties supporting the People's Front platform won several
seats.
   Results from about 15 seats had still not been determined,
Lohmus said.
   Although officials results were not expected until Friday, Lempi
Tekone, a spokeswoman for the Estonian People's Front said the
party expected to have the support of about three-quarters of the
deputies.
   She said the Yedinstvo organization representing
Russian-speaking residents would probably have about 25 percent of
the seats, and Free Estonia, formed by the republic's Communist
Party, won about 10 seats.
   Many activists said they expect the former Communist Party to
cautiously support moves for independence.
   Throughout the Slavic republics, voters chose between candidates
in 1,610 runoffs, held after no candidate gained 50 percent of the
vote in the main round of parliament and local council elections
March 4.
   According to Moscow's electoral commission, 55 out of the
capital's 65 seats in Russia's parliament were won by candidates
representing the reformist Democratic Russia alliance. The group
also won 281 seats out of 498 in the city council, said Interfax, a
news agency of Radio Moscow.
   In Leningrad, reformists from the Democratic Elections-90 bloc
won 60 percent to 70 percent of the contested seats, the official
Tass news agency said.
   Elena Zelinskaya of the Northwest Information Agency, an
independent for-profit news agency focusing on the Leningrad area,
said Communist Party members also scored some victories. They were
mostly in the so-called closed electoral districts such as army
units, where campaigning was not allowed.
   Initial results in Byelorussia showed gains for democrats, but
new elections were expected in about one-quarter of the districts
since none of the candidates gained 50 percent of the vote in the
runoffs, Tass said.
   In Latvia, the People's Front said it won 118 spots in the
201-seat parliament, a large majority among the 171 delegates
elected. Rozenvald said the front could get the support of 12
candidates from other parties and control 130 seats in parliament.
   Still, that would fall short of the two-thirds majority, or 134
seats, needed to change Latvia's constitution and declare
independence. Tass reported that initial results showed the Front
only won 108 seats.
   Lithuania's parliament declared the republic independent on
March 11. Ever since, Lithuania has been engaged in a bitter
conflict with Moscow, which declared the move illegal and on Monday
warned it would not tolerate attempts to act on the independence
declaration.
   Latvia followed Lithuania's example and legalized alternative
political parties several months ago. No such move was made in
Estonia but several parties competed there. The Soviet Congress
legalized multiple political parties for the whole country last
week.

   Clayton Williams, the Republican nominee for
governor of Texas, said today he hopes to jump on President Bush's
coattails and ``ride them like a bucking bronco'' into office.
   Williams won a promise today from Bush to help him raise funds
for November's gubernatorial election and to campaign personally
for him.
   ``I have asked him to come and help whenever and wherever he
can,'' Williams told reporters outside the White House.
   He said he needed Bush's help in financing an $11 million
campaign. The wealthy Texas businessman told reporters he had
already sunk $6.5 million of his own funds into his race and ``I'm
about at the end of my rope. If I put any more in...the bankers
will eat me alive.''
   The candidate discussed the Texas race with Bush in the Oval
Office and then had lunch with him.
   Williams told reporters the president ``has some wonderful
coattails and I'd like to grab a-hold of them and ride them like a
bucking bronco.''
   Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater, who accompanied
Williams, said Bush ``made it clear he will be coming to Texas and
wants to help from a fund-raising standpoint. Mrs. Bush also wants
to help.''
   ``And let's face it,'' Atwater added, ``this is his (Bush's)
home state. He loves Texas. He loves the politics of Texas.''
   The RNC chairman called Williams' chances of winning the
election ``much better than even....This guy is the political
phenonomen of 1990.''
   Williams was invited by Bush last week after he won the GOP
primary for governor in a rout. He made the rounds of party offices
here Monday, including a stop at the Republican Governors'
Association to seek a campaign contribution.
   The national party didn't take sides before the primary, but
association Executive Director Michele Davis said her group is
ready to make a large contribution to Williams now.
   ``You bet,'' she said. ``I've got a request in to the executive
committee for approval ... It's a chunk.
   ``We want to say, `Yep, we're with you,''' she said.
   Known as ``Claytie,'' Williams relied on a plain-spoken Texas
appeal _ and a television campaign bankrolled with his own money _
to swamp his Republican opponents in the state's open primary.
   ``I had an old cowboy uncle who said, `Son, you don't learn
anything while you're talking,''' Williams said Monday, explaining
that he was doing more listening than talking during his two-day
trip to Washington.
   With Democrats facing a bruising runoff election, Williams is
the early favorite in the general election and the Republicans'
hottest new political phenomenon.
   ``We've got a lot of new friends,'' quipped his press secretary,
Bill Kenyon.
   Williams' success has given Republicans a boost in Texas, one of
the three biggest states with governor's races this year and one
the GOP places a priority on holding in anticipation of
redistricting after the 1990 census.
   Wearing elaborately stitched black-and-white cowboy boots with
his gray suit, Williams also paid calls at the Texas state office
in Washington, the bipartisan National Governors' Association and
the National Cattlemen's Association.
   Williams' cattle operations _ just one of his business ventures,
along with oil and gas, banking and real estate _ make him the
nation's seventh largest calf producer, Kenyon said.
   Williams also planned to meet with administration drug policy
director William Bennett and Energy Secretary James Watkins during
his Washington visit.
   Accompanied by his wife, Modesta, Williams first met with
Republican Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, who also is running for
re-election this year, at Gramm's Senate office. They agreed last
week in Houston to a joint get-out-the-vote effort.
   ``We talked about three things _ strategy, strategy and
strategy,'' Williams said.
   ``I think Claytie is going to be a great partner. I know there
are some that will write us off as just two pretty faces, but
that's something I think we can overcome,'' Gramm quipped.

   The navy rescued 14 fishermen who were
adrift for 12 hours in a life raft on choppy seas Tuesday after
their boat sank off the Madeira islands, a news agency reported.
   The fishermen were unharmed. They were brought aboard the patrol
boat Cuanza after their inflatable raft was spotted by an air-se
rescue plane, according to the Lusa news agency.
   Three French ships had joined the Portuguese naval and air force
patrols in the search for the raft about 40 miles south of Porto
Santo island, Lusa said.
   The fishermen sent out distress signals at dawn indicating they
were abandoning their sinking vessel, the Marinho, the navy said.
   Madeira and Porto Santo are islands 625 miles southwest of
Lisbon.

   Muddy flood waters from last week's
torrential rains in Alabama and Georgia coursed through the Florida
Panhandle today, damaging homes and businesses and threatening
supports for an interstate highway bridge over a raging river.
   Flood damage was expected to worsen in Florida, where at least
1,200 people fled their homes. Some rivers in the northern part of
the state wouldn't crest until Wednesday, a National Weather
Service forecaster said today.
   In Alabama and Georgia, authorities began assessing damage from
storms that dumped up to 16 inches of rain Thursday and Friday.
Flood-related accidents killed 17 people and about 4,000 fled their
homes in those two states.
   Cold air followed receding flood waters in Alabama and Georgia
today, the first day of spring. Temperatures dipped to 30 degrees
this morning in Birmingham, Ala., and hovered just above freezing
in Atlanta. Freezing temperatures also were recorded in Tennessee
and Kentucky.
   A mixture of rain and snow was falling today in the nation's
capital. The band of snow showers stretched from central
Pennsylvania, through Maryland, central Virginia and into central
North Carolina.
   In Virginia, 6 inches of snow fell in Lynchburg, 2 inches in
Roanoke and 4 inches near Charlottesville.
   Alabama Gov. Guy Hunt asked President Bush for federal aid
Monday for Coffee County, where the swollen Pea River burst a levee
and inundated Elba, a town of 4,400 people.
   Hunt also requested federal aid for 25 other flooded counties in
central and south Alabama, but said he would ask Bush to help
Coffee County first.
   Some of Elba's evacuees returned Monday for their first look at
the destruction.
   ``It didn't really hurt until I got here. Then it tore me up,''
said Mike Simmons, who returned home to find a waterline on his
ceiling, overturned furniture and smaller items still floating in
several inches of water.
   National Guardsmen and state troopers patrolled the streets
enforcing a 7 p.m. curfew after some reports of looting in downtown
Elba, which remained under several feet of water. Telephone, gas
and electric service was out.
   There was another problem in Elba and elsewhere in the region:
the high waters flushed out snakes, which could be seen swimming
through inundated neighborhoods.
   The Pea River empties into the Choctawhatchee River in Florida,
and its muddy water was already a foot deep in Billy Wayne Bailey's
four-bedroom house in Caryville on Monday and was expected to rise
another 3 feet before cresting today. The river was at 20.5 feet
this morning, nearly 9 feet over flood stage.
   ``Well, it's already done the damage so it doesn't matter now
far it goes,'' Bailey said as he looked down on his home from
nearby U.S. Highway 90.
   ``We got out the night they showed Elba on television,'' Bailey
said. ``I didn't wait for nobody to tell me. I just went ahead and
left. I've been snatching other people out for the last two days.''
   Washington County commissioners on Monday ordered all of
Caryville's 630 residents and 200 people in surrounding communities
to move to higher ground. Hundreds more fled voluntarily.
   A 20-mile stretch of west-bound Interstate 10, from Bonifay to
DeFuniak Springs, was closed by state transportation officials
Monday afternoon because of concern about erosion around the
supports of the highway's bridge over the Choctawhatchee.
   The Choctawhatchee Bridge, a 2,000-foot span on I-10 West, will
be closed until a contractor hired by the state Department of
Transportation can repair the pilings, said state Transportation
Department spokesman Tommie Speights.
   The department will hire another contractor to build a temporary
crossover road connecting the westbound lane with another bridge
that heads east on the interstate, allowing one-lane traffic in
both directions, Speights said.
   Flooding in Caryville forced the closure of U.S. Highway 90,
which parallel's I-10 two miles to the north, and State Route 279
which connects the two federal highways, said Ginger Vance, a
spokeswoman for Washington County.
   In neighboring Holmes County, about 150 residents evacuated
areas north of Caryville, said James Merchant, county emergency
management director.
   Flooding also forced evacuations along the Apalachicola River
near Bloutstown, Escambia River near Cantonment and the Blackwater
River near Milton.
   Swollen rivers swamped sewage-treatment plants in Atlanta and
Macon, Ga. Macon officials ordered residents to boil water after
flood waters swamped a water-treatment plant.
   But Macon's levee, reinforced by sandbags, held. The Ocmulgee
River crested 4 feet below the levee's top.
   ``We're glad we dodged the bullet,'' said Larry Brown, acting
director of Macon's public works department.

   The independence of Namibia,
the last colony in Africa, marks the end of colonial rule on a
continent once carved up and ruled by European powers hungry for
imperial glory.
   Tuesday's end of South African rule in the vast arid territory
after 75 years also marks the end of a process that began in 1957
when Ghana became the first European colony in Africa to become
independent. In the years since, some 50 African nations have
emerged from colonial rule to become independent.
   Namibia's peaceful independence after a 23-year bush war between
South African forces and nationalist black guerrillas has added to
hopes that South Africa's racial divisions may also be resolved
peacefully.
   Nearly all of Africa except for Ethiopia and Liberia was divided
up between the European powers in what historians call ``The
Scramble for Africa,'' mainly in the 19th century.
   The colonization of Africa, according to the historian Basil
Davidson, meant Africans ``had lost their independence, and, with
this, their capacity to develop along their own lines.''
   ``They had lost, in short, the command of their own history,''
he wrote.
   While European colonization of Africa began with the Portugese
in the 15th century, most of the continent was carved up by Britain
and France in the late 19th century. The two imperial powers took
over huge tracts of territory across the continent, sweeping aside
African resistance.
   Even minor powers such as Belgium, Spain and Portugal carved out
colonies far larger than their own size. The king of Belgium ran
the huge Belgian Congo as a private enterprise.
   Much of the territory gobbled up by the European powers was
jungle, desert and swamps of little value. Few of the colonies ever
did more than consume the funds of the colonial mother country and
never produced the wealth predicted by colonial officials.
   The European officials and soldiers who served in these
far-flung colonies in the early days had notoriously short lives.
British officials in some fever-ridden West African colonies never
booked return ship tickets, because so few completed their tours of
duty. West Africa was called `The White Man's Grave.'
   ``Death was accepted as part of the day's work,'' said one
British colonial civil servant.
   Despite the worthlessness of many of these colonies, the
European powers competed frantically to snap up African territory.
Empires and colonies gave enormous prestige and Europeans of all
classes gloried in their nation's foreign possessions.
   The pursuit of colonies added to the international tensions that
dragged Europe into World War I in 1914. When the war came, little
colonial armies fought each other in Africa, with British and
French troops seizing Germany's colonies.
   A German army of a few thousand men, mainly African troops, held
out in East Africa until the end of the war in 1918, fighting off
much larger English, Indian, South African, Belgian and Portuguese
forces.
   Namibia, then called South West Africa, was a German colony
captured by South African forces during the war.
   But the European powers gave up their African colonies
relatively easily after World War II when colonialism started to go
out of fashion and liberation movements sprang up in Africa.
   Britain and France released most of their African colonies. Only
Portugal put up a long, bitter fight to try to retain Angola,
Mozambique and its other possessions, but conceded defeat in the
mid-1970s.
   South Africa also fought for years to retain Namibia, until its
leaders concluded the war against the South West African Peoples
Organization was no longer feasible. SWAPO won subsequent elections
in 1989.
   Now South Africa is the sole portion of Africa that remains
under white rule. But white South Africans reject radicals'
assertions that their nation also is a colony. White settlement in
South Africa dates back 350 years and the politically dominant
Afrikaners of Dutch descent regard themselves as Africans with no
other home.
   Recognizing the change in African history, South African
President F.W. de Klerk has said whites must find a new way to live
in their country and he has started to work toward the end of
white-minority rule.
   De Klerk says South Africans must seek a peaceful solution, as
in Namibia, or face the threat of a race war he warns would last
for generations.

   Iran-Contra prosecutors wrapped up their
criminal case against former national security adviser John
Poindexter today after 7{ days of testimony from 10 witnesses.
   Lawyers for Poindexter were to open their defense this afternoon.
   Videotaped testimony by former President Reagan, obtained at the
request of Poindexter's lawyers, is expected to be shown in court.
   The government's last witness, a Senate staffer, said it seemed
``strange'' that Poindexter knew so little about a November 1985
shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran.
   Poindexter is accused of concealing from Congress the U.S. role
in the Hawks shipment and Oliver North's military assistance and
fund raising for the Contras.
   North was the government's main witness against Poindexter, but
testified reluctantly against his old boss. The former White House
aide said he watched Poindexter tear up a presidential document
ratifying the 1985 Hawks shipment.
   Poindexter told Sens. David Durenberger and Patrick Leahy that
he had learned of the Hawks shipment only in January 1986, Senate
staffer Eric Newsome testified.
   Poindexter's discussion with Durenberger and Leahy took place
just hours before the national security adviser destroyed the
finding, a politically embarrassing document which depicted U.S.
involvement in Iran arms sales as a straight arms-for-hostages deal.
   ``It did seem strange to me that he didn't know more than he did
about the Hawks shipment,'' testified Newsome, who took notes in an
hour-long discussion in Poindexter's White House office on Nov. 21,
1986.
   Poindexter also told Durenberger and Leahy that it was ``unclear
whether there was prior knowledge'' of the shipment by U.S.
officials, testified Newsome, reading from a memo he typed up after
the meeting.
   Durenberger, R-Minn., was chairman at the time of the Senate
intelligence committee. Leahy, D-Vt., was vice chairman of the
panel.
   On Monday, Rep. Lee Hamilton testified that Poindexter failed to
tell the House intelligence committee about a presidential document
that approved the missile shipment to Iran. Then-CIA Director
William Casey said the document didn't exist, said Hamilton.
   Poindexter said ``the U.S. government had not approved'' and
``did not know about'' the shipment, said Hamilton. He was chairman
of the House intelligence committee, which met with Poindexter just
before he met with Durenberger and Leahy.
   The trial was continuing today with the government's final
witnesses. U.S. District Judge Harold Greene denied a defense
motion for a mistrial Monday after some of Hamilton's testimony
touched on statements that Poindexter gave Congress in 1987 under
immunity from prosecution.
   Hamilton said Monday that ``almost the first words that Admiral
Poindexter said'' when he walked into the meeting were that
``President Reagan ... wanted to tell the full story.''
   ``When Mr. Poindexter was making statements about Iran arms you
believed him?'' asked Iran-Contra prosecutor Dan Webb.
   ``I did,'' Hamilton replied.
   Webb questioned the congressman about the presidential
authorization document, called a finding.
   ``He didn't tell you at all about the 1985'' document? Webb
asked.
   ``I didn't know there was such a finding,'' Hamilton replied.
   In a separate meeting the same day, Casey told the intelligence
committee there was no document authorizing the shipment of Hawk
anti-aircraft missiles to Iran, Hamilton said.
   ``Do you remember Casey in that testimony actually telling you
there was no finding for that 1985 shipment?'' Webb asked Hamilton.
   ``I do,'' the congressman replied.
   A year before, Casey had sent the finding directly to Poindexter
for President Reagan's signature. Casey attached a note to
Poindexter saying the finding ``should not be passed around in any
hands below our level.''
   Hours after Casey's and Poindexter's discussions with Congress,
Poindexter destroyed the politically embarrassing presidential
document. It depicted U.S. involvement in Iran arms sales as a
straight arms-for-hostages deal.
   The former national security adviser is accused of concealing
from Congress Oliver North's military assistance to the Contra
rebels in Nicaragua and the U.S. role in the missile shipment to
Iran.
   Earlier in the day, Webb inadvertently brought out some of
Poindexter's immunized congressional testimony in questioning
Hamilton about the presidential finding.
   Had Poindexter ever reported destroying the document? Webb asked.
   ``He did,'' Hamilton said in front of the jury.
   The congressman, c-chairman of a special congressional committee
that investigated the Iran-Contra affair, was referring to
Poindexter's July 1987 testimony to the committee, during which he
said he tore up the document.
   No part of the case against Poindexter may be derived from his
testimony to Congress, given under a grant of immunity from
prosecution.
   Webb rephrased the question, but defense attorney Richard
Beckler asked for a mistrial, saying that Hamilton had specifically
been instructed not to refer to Poindexter's immunized testimony.
   Greene denied the motion, saying that North testified last week
that he watched Poindexter tear up the finding.
   Greene said Hamilton's testimony was ``cumulative rather than
harmful.''
   Beckler suggested the jury might not find North's testimony
credible. But Greene also noted that ``both the government and the
defense referred to tearing up of the finding'' in their opening
statements to the jury.
   ``And you have great credibility,'' the judge told Beckler.
   The information about tearing up the finding ``is not new at
all,'' Greene concluded.
   In his opening statement, Beckler said Poindexter tore up the
document ``because it was not accurate'' in portraying the arms
shipments solely as an attempt to free American hostages held in
Lebanon.
   Beckler noted that it was replaced by another finding that
portrayed the arms shipments as an attempt to establish a more
moderate government in Iran as well as to further the release of
the hostages.

   NASA today successfully concluded a
two-day practice countdown for space shuttle Discovery's April
flight to deploy the Hubble Space Telescope.
   Five astronauts were in the shuttle's cockpit for the final two
hours of the launch day dress rehearsal, intended to train ground
controllers and the flight crew.
   ``Overall, we had a smooth countdown, with nothing that would
preclude launching Discovery and the Hubble Space Telescope on
April 12,'' said George Diller, a spokesman for the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration. ``All space shuttle systems
performed as expected,'' Diller said.
   April 12 is the target date for Discovery to begin its five-day
mission to put the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope into orbit.
NASA officials will set a firm date early next month.
   From space, the telescope will have a clear view of faraway
galaxies that scientist believe will provide detailed information
about the formation of the universe. The 94-inch telescope is named
for Edwin P. Hubble, an astronomer in the 1920s and 1930s.
   Discovery's crew members are Air Force Col. Loren J. Shriver,
the commander; Marine Col. Charles F. Bolden, Jr., the pilot; and
mission specialists Steven A. Hawley, Navy Capt. Bruce McCandless
II and Kathryn Sullivan.

<HEAD>Former DEA Agent Ordered Held Without Bail Pending Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former federal drug agent accused of
narcotics trafficking and money laundering was denied bail pending
his trial.
   U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. ruled Monday that
Darnell Garcia was likely to flee and a danger to the community if
bail were set.
   A Sept. 4 trial date was set for Garcia and two other former
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents, John Jackson and Wayne
Countryman.
   Prosecutors contend the agents stole drugs confiscated during
DEA raids. Authorities say the agents sold the drugs, laundered
narcotics profits and leaked information to drug dealers about
federal investigations against them.
   Garcia, of Rancho Palos Verdes, traveled around the world after
he was suspended in 1987 during a corruption investigation,
authorities said.
   Garcia reportedly spent time in Rio De Janeiro, Madrid, Paris,
Frankfurt and Luxembourg before he was arrested last July for a
passport violation. He was extradited from Luxembourg in February.
   Garcia originally was charged in 26 of the 42 counts in the
indictment, but was extradited on six counts.
   He pleaded innocent Monday to one count of stealing heroin from
the DEA and one of possession with intent to distribute heroin.
   Defense attorney Mary Gibbons said she will challenge the other
counts involving money laundering and conspiracy because they were
``not within the extradition treaty'' between the U.S. and the tiny
Western European country.
   In January, a judge ordered Jackson held without bail and set
bond for Countryman at $120,000.

<TEXT>
   A white Briton quit his job in London
to fly to Namibia. A black Namibian rose before dawn Tuesday to
drive six hours across the desert. A teacher used the new
Constitution to instruct students.
   Independence in Africa's last colony drew tens of thousands of
celebrants in Windhoek, each for their own reasons.
   ``Independence doesn't mean you can be lazy, it means hard work,
taking responsibility so that you can be a leader,'' said Usko
Shivute, a history teacher.
   He uses Namibia's democratic, Western-style Constitution to
teach the values of free speech and respect for the opinions of
others, he said. He also tries to keep a lid on the rising
expectations that come with independence.
   ``Nothing will be free,'' Shivute tells his students. ``But now
we will have more opportunity.''
   Shivute helped plan the weeklong independence celebrations in
Windhoek, the modern capital and largest city with about 120,000
people. Nightly parties were planned. The new red, blue and green
flag with a golden sun in one corner waved from virtually every
shop on Kaiser Street, the main throughfare.
   ``Namibia, Free At Last,'' said bumper stickers.
   Posters on the roadside showed black and white children arm in
arm under the heading, ``Our Free Nation.''
   Dozens of foreign leaders and thousands of diplomats and
journalists arrived in Windhoek, a city with less than 500 hotel
rooms.
   The small airport, about 30 miles outside Windhoek in the scrub
brush of the Namibian countryside, was expected to handle nearly
100 flights Tuesday, up from the usual average of six.
   Due to lack of space, planes dropped their passengers then took
off again to park in neighboring countries.
   ``I want to see (Libyan leader) Moammar Gadhafi,'' said Ben
Goagoseb, 26. ``We have heard so much about him and he has always
identified with our struggle for independence.''
   Goagoseb and other young black men said Gadhafi was the foreign
figure they most wanted to see, even more so than South African
black leader Nelson Mandela.
   Gadhafi was invited, but it was uncertain whether he would
attend.
   Dokes Tjitombo and his brother, Alex, rose before dawn Tuesday
and drove six hours from Namibia's northeast corner to Windhoek for
the celebrations.
   ``We just came for a day because we wanted to see
independence,'' said Tjitombo, a 35-year-old driver wearing a
T-shirt with the new national flag emblazoned on the chest.
   David Maxwell quit his job at a London brokerage firm in October
and came to Namibia to witness the independence process.
   ``There's a spirit of good will from blacks and whites. I think
both sides are willing to bury the past,'' said Maxwell.
   Maxwell, 29, was living in South Africa in 1980 when
neighboring, white-ruled Rhodesia became black-ruled Zimbabwe.
   ``There was much more hostility there than in Namibia,'' said
Maxwell. ``Whites are a bit nervous (in Namibia), but they are much
more positive about the future.''

   A federal regulation that prohibits
government-funded family planning clinics from discussing abortion
with clients is an unconstitutional infringement on freedom of
speech, an appeals court has ruled.
   The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, said in a ruling released
late Monday that the speech at issue involves telling a woman about
an activity _ abortion _ ``in which she has a constitutional right
to engage.''
   Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon and attorneys for
various family planning groups challenged the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services for enforcing the family planning
regulations in 1988.
   The regulations prohibited people in medical facilities that
received money under the federal Title X program from counseling
women about abortion and from referring pregnant women to any
facilities that perform abortion.
   The court said in its 4-1 decision that the secretary of Health
and Human Services has tried to use funding ``to limit public
discussion on abortion rights. It is by now black letter law that
such a restriction is a violation of the First Amendment.''
   Lucy Eddinger, a spokeswoman for the HHS Office of Population
Affairs, said this morning that the federal government had not had
time to review the case. ``We understand there has been a decision,
but no one has seen that decision, so we won't have a comment until
we have read it,'' Eddinger said.
   The ruling is binding only in the 1st Circuit, which has
jurisdiction over Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island
and Puerto Rico. Other circuits can be expected to be influenced by
it, however.
   The appeals court affirmed a decision by U.S. District Court
Judge Walter Skinner.
   In May, three judges of the 1st Circuit ruled in favor of the
state, upholding the injunction that blocked the ban on referrals
from taking effect.
   But when the U.S. Supreme Court handed down a decision in the
Missouri case of Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services two
months later, the federal government asked the 1st Circuit to
rehear the arguments.
   The Webster decision gave states broader discretion to set
limits on abortion.
   Judge Juan Torruella, who dissented in Monday's ruling, cited
the Webster decision.
   ``In my opinion, the secretary has merely refused to fund an
activity which the government is not constitutionally required to
support, without imposing legal obstacles to a citizen's choice of
action in a protected area,'' Torruella said.
   Ruling in favor of the state were Chief Judge Levin Campbell and
Judges Hugh Bownes, Stephen Breyer and Bruce Selya.

   An explosion and fire struck a
major oil refinery early Tuesday, injuring six workers, authorities
said.
   Firefighters brought the blaze under control at the Shell
chemical processing plant at Stanlow in northwest Britain, said a
spokesman for Shell U.K. Ltd.
   The plant occupies a half-acre site inside the refinery, which
is on the southern bank of the River Mersey and about 10 miles from
the port city of Liverpool.
   Ten people were in the plant at the time of the blast, and six
were injured, including one person with serious burns, the BBC
reported.
   The BBC said nobody was evacuated from the area.
   The cause of the explosion was being investigated, the Shell
spokesman said.

<HEAD>Fear of Malpractice Slows Spread of New Heart Attack Treatment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many heart attack victims are being denied
life-saving new treatment because doctors fear they will be sued if
their patients suffer strokes, a rare but devastating complication
of the therapy, specialists say.
   New clot-dissolving medicines can literally stop a heart attack
if given within a few hours after the start of chest pains. But
many heart doctors believe this treatment has been too slow to
catch on in the United States.
   Heart attack victims often wait too long before going to the
hospital to be able to benefit from the treatment. However, many
others don't get the medicine even when they arrive at the
emergency room in time.
   The reasons vary, but some advocates of aggressive treatment say
their colleagues' fear of malpractice suits has played an important
role.
   ``This has been one of the main impediments to the proliferation
of treatment in the United States,'' said Dr. Robert Califf of Duke
University.
   Califf raised the issue at this week's meeting of the American
College of Cardiology. Many other heart specialists said they
agreed.
   ``There is no doubt in my mind that it affects physicians'
choice of therapy,'' said Dr. William B. Smith of Tulane
University. ``The fear of lawsuits is real.''
   When all goes well, the new drugs, known as thrombolytic agents,
clearly save lives. A heart attack usually occurs when a blood clot
gets stuck in the arteries that feed the heart. Within a few hours,
a section of the heart muscle dies.
   But if given quickly, the drugs can dissolve the clot,
preventing most of the damage. In studies, the treatment typically
has reduced the heart attack death rate from 12 percent to 6
percent.
   But because the therapy interferes with the body's normal
tendency to make blood clots, the treatment can trigger a major
side effect: unwanted bleeding. In most parts of the body, such
bleeding can be controlled. But if a blood vessel spews blood
inside the brain, doctors are powerless to stop it, and the result
is often a crippling stroke.
   Such strokes occur in about one in 200 or 300 people who receive
the clot-dissolving drugs.
   Doctors routinely exclude people at high risk of bleeding from
receiving the treatment. These include those with high blood
pressure, the elderly and victims of prior strokes.
   Under current guidelines, about 25 percent of all heart attack
victims are considered to be good candidates for clot-dissolving
therapy. Estimates vary, but experts say that probably only about 5
percent actually get this treatment in the United States.
   Califf said he already has been sued because of a stroke
resulting from the heart attack treatment. He added that many other
doctors have said they are reluctant to offer the therapy because
of fear of lawsuits.
   ``You simply can't have a bad outcome in the United States
without someone asking, `Was it the doctor's fault?''' he said.
   Dr. Peter Rentrop of St. Vincent's Hospital in New York noted
that a malpractice lawsuit can be professionally and financially
damaging. So doctors consider the legal as well as the medical
risks of clot-dissolving therapy.
   ``You always have to ask: `If the patient has a complication, do
I have a strong defense?''' Rentrop said. ``If I have a weak
defense, I have an obligation to myself and my family not to
treat.''
   Surgeons routinely accept the risk that some proportion of their
patients will not survive operations. Dr. Jeremy Swan of the
University of California, Los Angeles said internists, too, should
be able to live with a small risk that their therapy will be lethal.
   ``They will not suffer malpractice suits if they can show that
they followed accepted standards,'' he said.
   Dr. Keith Fox of the University of Edinburgh in Scotland
cautioned that doctors who don't offer clot-dissolving drugs also
may be sued for failure to properly treat heart attacks, and
several such lawsuits have been filed in Europe.
   ``The evidence in relation to benefit is very clear,'' he said,
``and we are seeing this on both sides of the Atlantic.''

   Police arrested a man _ twice _ after
he allegedly caused a four-car accident with a stolen lawn mower
and then commandeered a patrol car while his hands were cuffed
behind his back.
   Police Officer T.L. Bailey gave chase in a borrowed a pickup
truck, spotted his parked cruiser and arrested Earl Thomas Pryce,
28, of High Point, after a chase on foot.
   The incident began Monday when a riding lawn mower that was
being towed with a 10-foot rope began weaving and was hit by a
truck. Two other cars collided as they tried to avoid the scattered
parts.
   Police arrested Pryce, handcuffed him and belted him into the
front passenger seat of a patrol car, according to Lt. T. Shuler.
With Pryce in the car, Bailey began questioning the drivers of the
other cars.
   At that point, Shuler said, Pryce ``got out of the seatbelt and
slid under the driver's wheel and left the scene in the police car.
It's wild.''
   The cruiser was found about a mile away, parked behind a
business. Shuler said Pryce ran, ``and we chased him for about
another half-hour after that.''
   Pryce initially was charged with driving while impaired, driving
while his license was revoked and having improper registration.
   He later was charged with larceny of a motor vehicle, hit and
run causing personal injury, and careless and reckless driving. He
also was charged with larceny in connection with the theft of the
lawn mower earlier in the day.

   Seven medals awarded to a French Resistance
heroine who smuggled out British agents and details of German V1
and V2 rockets have been bought by the Imperial War Museum for
$28,500, it was announced Tuesday.
   Berthe Fraser was best known for smuggling the British agent
code-named ``The White Rabbit'' through a German encampment in a
mock funeral along with details of the secret German weapons.
   Christie's auctioneers said the museum's bid for the medals and
accompanying documents was four times higher than its estimated
value of $6,000 to $9,000. It said they were sold by private
collector W. H. Fevyer.
   Mrs. Fraser began helping British servicemen in 1940 and soon
was plotting escape routes for them.
   She organized a mock funeral to smuggle Cmdr. Forest Yeo-Thomas
out of France in November 1943, hiding him in a hearse under
flowers and the weapon plans inside the coffin. A German patrol
inspected the cortege, but didn't find them.
   Mrs. Fraser was twice captured by the Germans, but refused to
betray the Resistance despite torture and threatened execution. She
was liberated by the Allies on Sept. 2, 1944.
   The French-born heroine was awarded Britain's George Medal for
heroism, France's Legion of Honor, the senior award for gallantry
and France's Croix de Guerre for military service. She never fully
regained her health after her wartime imprisonment and died in 1956.

<HEAD>Court Says Union Members May be Entitled to Jury Trials in Suits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that workers
who sue their unions for allegedly failing to represent them fairly
may be entitled to jury trials to settle the issue.
   By a 6-3 vote, the court said union members must be given jury
trials if their suits seek monetary compensation such as back pay.
   The decision is a victory for 27 truck drivers who sued a North
Carolina local of the Teamsters union.
   ``The money damages (the drivers) seek are the type of relief
traditionally awarded by courts of law,'' Justice Thurgood Marshall
wrote for the court. ``Thus, the (Constitution's) Seventh Amendment
entitles (them) to a jury trial.''
   Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin
Scalia dissented.
   Lawsuits accusing unions of breaching their duty of fair
representation usually are tried before judges without juries. Such
suits generally seek to end some asserted unfair treatment or to
force a union into taking some action.
   In most such cases, an employer also is sued and charged with
breaching a collective-bargaining agreement. To win money damages,
a union member generally must prove the employer violated the union
contract and that the union breached its fair-representation duty.
   Local 391 of the Teamsters union was sued by 27 truck drivers in
1983, after they had been transferred from various locations to the
McLean Trucking Co.'s terminal in Winston-Salem, N.C.
   The 27 had been laid off and recalled on several occasions after
their move to Winston-Salem.
   Their lawsuit contends that McLean breached a
collective-bargaining agreement by manipulating recall procedures
so it could give other drivers preference, and that Local 391
failed to represent them fairly in the resulting grievances.
   McLean went bankrupt after the suit was filed and was dropped as
a defendant.
   The suit seeks from the Teamsters, among other things,
compensatory damages for lost wages and benefits. As a result of
Tuesday's ruling, the suit will reach a jury.
   In a separate decision, the court unanimously reinstated a
lawsuit by a black machinist who says he was fired illegally from
his Arden, N.C., job in 1983 because of his race.
   The high court said John S. Lytle's Seventh Amendment rights
were violated when he was denied a jury trial.
   The court also split 6-3 in ruling that Frances Dalm of Michigan
waited too long to sue the government over $20,262 in tax
overpayments.
   Kennedy wrote for the court in that case. Justices John Paul
Stevens, William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall dissented.

   President Chaim Herzog today named Labor Party
leader Shimon Peres as Israel's prime minister-designate and gave
him the difficult task of trying to form a new government.
   Israel television broadcast live coverage of Herzog giving a
letter of nomination to the 66-year-old Peres, who headed Israel's
government in 1984-6.
   Israeli law left Herzog with the authority to choose a candidate
for prime minister. Peres has six weeks to form a new ruling
coalition, but it was not certain he would be able to bring
together his leftist allies and conservative religiousd factions.
   Herzog met over the past two days with leaders of Israel's two
major parties to decide who has the best chance of forming a new
governing coalition. A reversal by a key religious faction Monday
left Labor and the right-wing Likud at a draw, with 60-60 support
in the 120-member Parliament.
   The Labor Party is technically Parliament's largest faction,
with 39 legislators.
   Caretaker Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, whose Likud bloc has 35
seats, fell in a parliamentary vote of no confidence last Thursday,
triggered by a dispute over Middle East peace moves.
   An official in Herzog's office, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the president's office has been inundated with
phone calls from Israelis complaining that the wheeling and dealing
has paralyzed the government.
   ``People say it is impossible to bear the political situation,''
the official said.
   Israel radio said Herzog, mirroring these sentiments, told some
politicians Monday that ``the Israeli public is fed up with
politicians.''
   The radio said Herzog's office also received a number of
anonymous telephone threats today, including one bomb threat.
Police searched and found no explosives, the radio said.
   Much of the maneuvering has involved small ultra-Orthodox
religious parties, notably the Shas faction whose spiritual leader,
69-year-old Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, caused the fall of Shamir's
Likud-Labor coaltion last week.
   Yosef said he ordered Shas to withhold support from Shamir
because his government was unable to move forward in the peace
process.
   But he reversed his stand Monday after a talk with his mentor,
92-year-old Rabbi Eliezer Shach, and a scolding from the nation's
two chief rabbis.
   In another development, Israel Monday welcomed the idea of peace
talks with its most implacable foe, Syria, but said the goal should
be an overall peace treaty rather than a proposed demilitarized
zone in the occupied Golan Heights.
   Former President Jimmy Carter, who met Syrian President Hafez
Assad last week, told reporters Sunday that Syria was ready for
``bilateral talks with Israel, including the Golan Heights.''
   Peres told Parliament last week that he received information the
``Syrians are proposing peace negotiations, demilitarizing the
Golan Heights.''
   Israel seized the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 Six-Day
war and annexed the 700-square-mile plateau in 1981. About 7,000
Israelis and 12,000 Druse Arabs live there.
   The strategic plateau overlooks northern Israel and the approach
to Syria's capital, Damascus. Prior to the 1967 war, Syrian gunners
used their positions on the heights to shell Israeli settlements in
the northern Galilee.
   Syria has previously demanded the return of all the territory,
but the latest hints raised the possibility of a troop withdrawal
as an interim solution.

<HEAD>Wilder Says Democrats Need Strong Presidential Candidate in '92</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   L. Douglas Wilder, catapulted to national
prominence as the nation's first black elected governor, said
Tuesday that if the Democrats fail to put up a strong mainstream
presidential candidate in 1992 ``we'll be locked out of the White
House for a long, long time.''
   The Virginia governor told The Associated Press that in the
Democratic presidential primary campaign he would actively support
a candidate who espouses ``mainstream values.''
   Wilder never mentioned Jesse Jackson by name, but he made clear
he does not believe Jackson shares those mainstream values.
   ``There isn't any single voice'' commanding the loyalty of
blacks, Wilder said, adding, ``there isn't going to be,''
   Wilder also spoke to the National Press Club, calling on
Democrats to embrace the conservative economic policies he has
pursued in his first few months as governor.
   ``Americans everywhere want to hold the line on spending and on
taxes,'' he said.
   ``There was a time when Democrats were elected by campaigning
against big government and high taxes. But for too long we have let
the other party take these issues away from us _ indeed, we have
allowed them to hammer us with these issues.''
   In his speech, Wilder also urged Democrats to ``stop fighting
each other'' long after primary battles are decided.
   ``We're doing the other party's dirty work for them _ and it
must stop if we are to ever again be more than mere guests at 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue.''
   Wilder has been one of the hottest properties in the Democratic
Party, much in demand as a speaker, since his history-making
election in November.
   He spoke at a party dinner in Chicago last week and is a
featured speaker on the agenda of the Democratic Leadership Council
meeting in New Orleans later this week.
   Many Democrats view Wilder as a mainstream alternative to
Jackson, who has twice run for the party's presidential nomination
from a base of overwhelming support within the black community.
   In the interview, Wilder suggested it was unlikely Republican
Sen. John Warner would face strong opposition for re-election this
fall.
   ``If you have somebody who is credible and can raise funds and
attract people for a winning campaign, fine, let's do that,'' he
said when asked about the prospects for a strong Democratic
challenge to Warner.
   ``We have a committee out looking for those persons,'' he said.
Then laughing, he added, ``They haven't come back yet.''
   As for the next presidential election, Wilder said: ``It's
essential that the Democrats put a strong candidate up in 1992.''
   He said that whomever the party nominates would have to be
someone who is ``close to mainstream values.'' If the party fails
to do that, he said, ``we'll be locked out of the White House for a
long, long time.''

<HEAD>Parents, Though Smarter, Still Make Potentially Deadly Mistakes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parents have become a lot smarter about
keeping medicines and hazardous chemicals from the mouths of their
children, but even the best-meaning parents can do something dumb.
   Like those who cajole Junior into taking his medicine by telling
him it's candy. That's an invitation to disaster, and it drives the
poison prevention folks right up the wall _ as they made clear at a
news conference Tuesday marking the 29th National Poison Prevention
Week.
   An even worse mistake: Storing paint thinners, antifreeze,
lighter fluid for the outdoor barbecue or household chemicals in a
soda bottle, cup or drinking glass.
   Overall, however, the news regarding the threat to small
children is good. As noted by President Bush in his annual
proclamation marking the public awareness campaign, which began
Sunday, there has been a 93 percent decrease since 1961 in the
accidental poisoning deaths of children under the age of five.
   That year, the last before Congress enacted legislation creating
Poison Prevention Week, 450 youngsters aged four and younger died.
In 1987, the last year for which complete statistics are available,
31 perished.
   The decline has been especially dramatic since the advent of
mandatory child-resistant closures, beginning with those for
aspirin products in 1972. Since then, child-resistant caps have
been required for various types of furniture polish, drain
cleaners, oven cleaners, lighter fluids, turpentine, paint
solvents, windshield washer solutions, antifreeze and
iron-containing vitamins and dietary supplements.
   In addition, drug manufacturers and pharmacists are required to
deliver all oral prescription drugs in child-resistant packages,
unless an adult specifically requests an easy-open container. All
too many, including grandparents, do just that, officials complain.
   At a news conference at Georgetown University Hospital,
Jacqueline Jones-Smith, chairman of the U.S. Consumer Product
Safety Commission, credited the child-resitant caps on oral
medications with saving the lives of an estimated 340 children
since 1974.
   Still, hundreds of thousands of children have what she termed
``near misses'' with poisons each year. In 1987, about 100,000
children were treated in emergency rooms for accidental ingestion
of hazardous materials and poison control centers received more
than half a million calls involving children.
   Toby Litovitz, poison control director at Georgetown and
president-elect of the American Association of Poison Control
Centers, said the 70 member centers reported 1.5 million poisonings
last year _ ``just a fraction'' of the number believed to have
actually occurred.
   She estimated the total at 4.7 million, of which she said 62
percent involved children.
   Litovitz said ``prescription medications, including
antidepressants, cardiac medications, asthma therapies and iron _
especially iron in prenatal vitamins _ are a continuing cause of
needless deaths in small children.''
   The Poison Prevention Week Council, headed by David Almquist of
the American Society of Hospital Pharmacists, urged parents to keep
on hand a one-ounce bottle of syrup of ipecac, which induces
vomiting, for each child in the home. But the substance should
never be administered without first consulting a poison control
center or physician, the group cautioned. It also warned that HUMCO
brand ipecac syrup should be replaced with another brand, because
that company has mistakenly labeled potentially deadly eucalyptus
oil as syrup of ipecac.
   The council also urged adults who have no children in their
homes to avoid the temptation to use easy-open containers for their
medications. ``Accidents have happened when youngsters have visited
homes where no children live,'' it noted.
   According to a safety commission study, 23 percent of the oral
prescription drugs that were accidentally ingested by children
belonged to someone who did not live with the child. About 17
percent involved drugs belonging to a grandparent or
great-grandparent.

<TEXT>
   Democratic Gov. William A. O'Neill, his
popularity sagging under the weight of a faltering state economy,
announced today that he will not seek election to a third full term.
   O'Neill, 59, insisted that recent polls indicating voter
approval of his performance at an all-time low weren't what drove
him from the race. After much soul-searching, O'Neill said, he and
his wife, Nikki, decided they didn't want to go through what
promised to be a bruising campaign.
   ``I firmly believe I could win re-election,'' O'Neill said at a
news conference at the governor's mansion. ``But the modern process
of campaigning is a rigorous one. It exacts a toll on the body and
the spirit which, at this point in my career, I do not choose to
pay.''
   O'Neill's announcement followed a week of intense speculation
about his plans. Word leaked out that O'Neill would not seek
re-election after he informed his staff of his decision during a
meeting this morning.
   In consecutive years of service, O'Neill is the longest-serving
Democratic governor in the nation. He took office Dec. 31, 1980,
after Gov. Ella Grasso resigned in poor health. He was elected to
full terms in 1982 and 1986.
   O'Neill had repeatedly said he would run again, barring an
unforeseen health problem. But he met with his doctors earlier
today and said his health was good and did not lead to his decision.
   During his nine years in office, O'Neill had a heart attack,
heart bypass surgery and, more recently, colon polyps, one of which
was cancerous.
   Two recent polls showed the governor finishing last in a three
way match-up with former U.S. Sen. Lowell P. Weicker, who is
running as an independent, and U.S. Rep. John G. Rowland, the
front-runner for the Republican nomination.
   O'Neill faced a challenge from U.S. Rep. Bruce A. Morrison, a
four-term congressman from Hamden, for this year's Democratic

   Other Democrats have said they'd be interested in the
nomination, should O'Neill step aside. They include Larson; state
Rep. William J. Cibes of New London; former West Hartford Mayor
Christopher Droney, brother of state Democratic Chairman John F.
Droney; and former state Rep. Timothy Moynihan of East Hartford, a
former Democratic state chairman and now president of the Greater

   U.S. Rep. Barbara B. Kennelly, a very popular four-term

   The prosecutor at Joseph Hazelwood's
trial suggested to jurors today that Exxon pressured crew members
to give testimony favorable to the tanker captain blamed for the
nation's worst oil spill.
   Assistant District Attorney Brent Cole, in his final argument at
Hazelwood's criminal trial, told jurors to notice ``the presence of
Exxon in this case,'' and recalled the testimony of an Exxon
executive who said that the company has an interest in the outcome
of Hazelwood's trial.
   ``It doesn't take a brain surgeon to see Exxon's interest in
this matter,'' Cole said. ``It's seeing Captain Hazelwood get
acquitted.''
   The prosecutor reminded jurors that crew members who testified
supported their captain on many issues, and sometimes changed the
stories they had originally given about the grounding of the Exxon
Valdez.
   ``It's easy to see the pressure they were putting on these crew
members,'' Cole said.
   Exxon lawyers have been present in the courtroom throughout the
trial and were seated in the front row as Cole spoke.
   Cole portrayed Hazelwood as ``a gambler'' who took the risk of
drinking before boarding the Exxon Valdez only to lose his ship.
   ``Captain Joseph Hazelwood chose to be a gambler,'' Cole said.
``He chose to be a risk taker. He chose to sit in the Pipeline Club
and drink most of the afternoon before he sailed.''
   Cole, the first attorney to speak in closing arguments at the
7-week-old trial, said Hazelwood risked his ship and the lives of
his crew, and should be found guilty of reckless conduct.
   ``He gambled that drinking would not affect his judgment,'' Cole
said. ``He was wrong, ladies and gentlemen, because alcohol never
improves judgment. Captain Joseph Hazelwood gambled and lost, and
it resulted in a captain's worst nightmare.''
   As Cole spoke, Hazelwood sat calmly at the defense table. His
wife and father, who recently arrived at the trial, sat in back-row
seats of the crowded courtroom.
   Using a large blackboard on which he mounted a blow-up picture
of the Exxon Valdez, Cole reminded jurors how the tanker ran
aground, ``bubbling oil into Prince William Sound.''
   And he told them to remember that a tanker captain's concern
should be ``safety first.''
   ``Captain Hazelwood did not have safety first in his mind when
he sat in the Pipeline Club or he wouldn't have been there,'' Cole
said.
   He recounted Hazelwood's actions in the hours preceding the
tanker's grounding, ``They were the actions and judgments of a
person whose mind was clouded with alcohol.''
   Defense attorney Dick Madson was to argue for the skipper's
total acquittal.
   Hazelwood is charged with a felony, criminal mischief, and three
misdemeanors: reckless endangerment, operating a vessel while
intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil. If convicted, he could
receive 7\ years in prison and $61,000 in fines.
   The Exxon Valdez ran aground on Bligh Reef on March 24, spilling
almost 11 million gallons of North Slope crude oil that wreaked
devastation over hundreds of miles of shoreline rich with fish,
birds and other wildlife.
   The intoxication charge is one of the most bitterly disputed
points of the trial.
   When officials tested Hazelwood 10{ hours after the grounding,
his blood-alcohol level was .061, below the .10 Alaska minimum to
be considered a drunken driver.
   Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone on Monday sided with the
prosecution in ruling that the jury would consider only whether the
43-year-old Huntington, N.Y., man was ``impaired'' by alcohol. The
defense wanted jurors to decide whether Hazelwood was ``noticeably
impaired.''
   The judge refused to add a proposed prosecution instruction in
which jurors would be told the Coast Guard's blood-alcohol limit
for operating a commercial vessel is .04, well below the state law.
Johnstone said the Coast Guard standard is a federal regulation,
not state law, and has not been admitted into evidence at the trial.
   Every crew member and investigator who saw Hazelwood on the
crucial night was asked about his sobriety. They testified he did
not stagger, slur his words or show any signs of intoxication,
although three witnesses smelled liquor on his breath.
   ``There are a lot of people who canmask their impairment,''
Johnstone told lawyers, explaining his decision to strike the word
``noticeably.''
   Madson appeared stunned by the ruling, saying, ``This is the
first time I've ever heard of this.''
   Madson said that in his years of defending drunken driving cases
in Fairbanks, the term ``noticeably impaired'' always has been
included in jury instructions.
   ``My gosh, it's been around for a long time,'' he told the judge.
   But Assistant District Attorney Sam Adams argued, ``All we have
to prove is that he was impaired, not stumble-down drunk.''

<TEXT>
   The Pentagon urged Congress Tuesday to give
the military the authority to revise the way personnel are laid
off, saying changes are needed so that forces remain balanced as a
leaner Defense Department cuts back.
   ``We need to work together to get some package put together to
provide us with the flexibility we need to manage the force
drawdown we all know is coming,'' said Christopher Jehn, assistant
secretary of defense for force management and personnel.
   Jehn and representatives of the military services stressed
before a Senate Armed Services subcommittee the importance of quick
approval of legislation the Defense Department proposed in July
1989.
   The bill revises certain restrictions involving voluntary and
involuntary ``separation'' of commissioned officers.
   Among the proposed changes would be allowing military
secretaries to convene selective early retirement boards to force
retirement of lieutenant colonels and commanders who have failed to
receive a promotion on one occasion.
   Previously, officers had to fail to gain promotion twice before
they would be considered by the board for retirement.
   ``We are asking for additional flexibility to allow us to shape
the officer corps in a balanced and equitable way,'' said Army Lt.
Gen. Allen K. Ono, deputy chief of staff for personnel.
   Sens. John Glenn, D-Ohio, chairman of the Armed Services
subcommittee on manpower and personnel, and John McCain, R-Ariz.,
said Congress needs a report on the Pentagon's policy plans for its
forces as it weighs the Defense Department request.
   Jehn said the report won't be completed until the end of the
year, but the Pentagon will try to make much of the information
available to Congress before it finishes its work on the fiscal
1991 defense budget.
   ``There's a sense of frustration here,'' McCain said. ``It's
very difficult to enact these measures unless we have a blueprint
for the future.''

<HEAD>Iranian Parliament Demands No Negotiations on Hostages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN MARRIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A majority of Iran's parliament members
has demanded that the government not negotiate to gain freedom for
Western hostages in Lebanon, Tehran radio reported Tuesday.
   The radio, monitored in Cyprus, said parliament issued a
statement Monday night saying the fate of the captives should
depend only on the Lebanese.
   The statement, signed by 170 members of the 270-member
parliament, was the latest sign of a power struggle in Tehran over
the captives.
   Moderates led by President Hashemi Rafsanjani have said the
issue is moving toward a solution. Hardliners, whose stance was
reflected in the parliament statement, oppose freeing the hostages.
   ``The fate of the Western hostages in Lebanon depends on what
the Moslem people of Lebanon want _ an end to the U.S. plots in
Lebanon and the clarification of the fate of the Lebanese and
Palestinian hostages in prisons in the West,'' the statement said.
   The pro-Iranian Lebanese Shiite Moslem groups that hold most of
the 18 Westerners have in the past demanded freedom for hundreds of
Palestinian and Lebanese prisoners held in Israeli jails.
   Many Middle Eastern countries consider Israel part of the West.
   ``The arrogant mass media's propaganda on separating the fate of
the Western hostages from the problems of Lebanon is strongly
condemned,'' the radio quoted the statement as saying.
   The reference was to reports that a release of hostages may be
imminent following alleged secret talks between Tehran and
Washington. No concrete signs have emerged to support the
speculation.
   The radio said parliament called on Iran's Foreign Ministry to
deny clearly what the radio called rumors that Iran was involved in
secret talks.
   Rafsanjani said March 7 there were no direct contacts with the
United States on the hostages, and Foreign Ministry officials
repeatedly have stressed that Iran is not directly involved.
   The United States also has denied any direct talks.
   The parliament statement urged the ministry to step up efforts
to determine the fate of four Iranians who went missing in north
Lebanon in 1982.
   Iran has ignored repeated statements by the Lebanese Forces, the
main Christian militia in Lebanon, that the four are dead, although
Rafsanjani has said if they were no longer alive their bodies
should be returned to Iran.
   The statement by the members of the Majlis, or parliament, was
the latest in a series reflecting an increasingly public fight in
Iran over the fate of the hostages.
   The debate started with a newspaper editorial in the Tehran
Times in February saying the hostages should be released without
conditions.
   The parliament statement reflected the stance taken in a recent
newspaper editorial by its leading hardline member, Ali Mohammad
Mohtashemi, saying Iran would not interfere in Lebanon and
encouraging the kidnappers to retain their captives.
   Hard-liners have said the rumours of U.S.-Iran contacts over the
hostages are an attempt to sow domestic discord in Iran. They
consider confronting the United States a cornerstone of the 1979
Islamic revolution.
   Rafsanjani's faction, however, seeks to improve contacts with
the West, in part to gain much-needed foreign investment for Iran's
post-war reconstruction.
   Most of the 18 hostages are believed held by groups linked to
Hezbollah, or Party of God, a Shiite organization heavily financed
by Iran. The hostages are eight Americans, four Britons, two West
Germans, two Swiss, an Irishman and an Italian.
   The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who marked his fifth year
in captivity on Friday.
   Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiite Moslem population, the largest of
the 17 religious sects among the 4 million Lebanese, is related to
that in Iran.
   The Shiite Moslems never achieved the political and economic
power built into the government structure by the Maronite Catholics
and Sunni Moslems. The structure cracked in 1975 with the start of
the civil war.

   A truck accident caused a power failure
today at the Plant Vogtle nuclear station, but the brief emergency
did not affect the plant's safety, Georgia Power officials said.
   ``There has been no release of radiation and no danger to the
public,'' said utility spokesman Tal Wright.
   One of the plant's two nuclear reactors was operating at the
time of the accident, Wright said. Although a backup generator
immediately supplied power, the operational reactor automatically
shut down and was being maintained in a ``stable'' condition, he
said.
   Another unit, which was not operating because of a refueling
operation, was without power for 36 minutes, the spokesman said. He
could not say why backup power was delayed to that unit.
   Wright said a heavy construction truck backed into a support
column in a switchyard at about 8:45 a.m., knocking out power.
   Wright said non-essential personnel were evacuated. But at
midday today, Georgia Power officials retracted that report, saying
no evacuation took place.
   Wright said that in accordance with Nuclear Regulatory
Commission regulations, the plant declared a ``site emergency,''
downgraded to an alert 15 minutes later.
   NRC inspectors headed for Plant Vogtle (pronounced VO-gul) in
east Georgia.

<TEXT>
   Here's a look at Tuesday's effort to count the
nation's homeless:
   Who:
   About 15,000 Census Bureau workers visit an estimated 11,000
shelters and an equal number of identified street locations.
   What:
   They interview homeless people if possible, and at the very
least count them for inclusion with all other Americans in the 1990
census. This special homeless count is costing about $2.7 million.
   When:
   From 6 p.m. to midnight enumerators will visit shelters and
low-cost hotels and motels. From 2 a.m. to 4 a.m. they go to
predetermined street and other outdoor sites where the homeless are
known to congregate. From 4 a.m. to 8 a.m. they are outside
abandoned buildings to count those coming out.
   Where:
   The effort includes every city of 50,000 or more residents and
smaller towns and rural areas where local officials reported having
a homeless population.
   Why:
   Homelessness has become an increasingly noticed problem in
America, but there are no good statistics showing the extent.
Estimates of the number of homeless vary from 250,000 to 3 million.
   Results:
   The effort is to find out how many people are homeless. But the
Bureau will not try and define that term. Instead, it will simply
report finding so many people on the streets, so many in shelters
or hotels, so many doubled up in apartments, etc.
   The results will be part of the general national population and
housing analysis, expected to published in late 1991.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Widens Sharply</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. trade deficit widened sharply to $9.3
billion in January as record demand for foreign oil offset an
all-time high in sales of American products overseas, the
government reported Tuesday.
   The January gap between imports and exports was 20.5 percent
larger than December's $7.7 billion deficit, which had been the
best monthly showing in five years.
   The Bush administration, which is counting on further
improvement in trade to boost economic growth this year, sought to
play down the huge December-to-January swing.
   But private economists were more pessimistic, warning that
America's trade woes could deepen this year due to a growing
dependence on foreign oil and a stronger U.S. dollar. The rise in
the dollar makes imports less expensive and therefore more
attractive to U.S. consumers while making American products less
competitive on overseas markets.
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
emphasized the robust growth in exports while minimizing the
overall deficit figure.
   ``Everyone seemed to realize they couldn't maintain that low
(deficit) level and so it was expected that there would be an
increase in January,'' he said.
   Exports climbed to a record high of $32.07 billion in January, 4
percent above the December level. However, that gain was swamped by
a 7.3 percent rise in imports, which increased to $41.32 billion.
   The increase in imports came primarily from a 44 percent surge
in oil shipments, reflecting a rush by oil companies to replenish
storage tanks depleted by unusually cold weather in December.
   The total volume of oil imports hit an all-time high of 291,278
barrels, surpassing the previous record set just last August. With
the price per barrel rising as well, the total oil bill climbed to
$5.86 billion, the highest total dollar amount since August 1982,
when the volume was less but the price per barrel was higher.
   Foreign oil accounted for a record 54 percent of consumption in
January, and with domestic production now at its lowest level in a
quarter century, analysts are concerned that rising dependence on
oil imports will make it increasingly difficult to reduce the trade
deficit further.
   Michael Evans, head of a Washington consulting firm, predicted
that this year's trade deficit could top $120 billion, up from a
$109 billion deficit in 1989.
   ``Without a weaker dollar, we are just not going to get an
improvement in trade,'' he said.
   David Wyss, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill, said the growing
trade deficit would increase calls for protectionist trade
legislation, especially in view of weakness in the overall economy.
   ``We are going nowhere in trade, and with the economy slowing
down, people aren't willing to tolerate trade problems,'' he said.
   The administration has tried to fight off protectionist
legislation with vows to open markets overseas, focusing on Tokyo
because of America's $49 billion deficit with Japan, representing
almost half of last year's total.
   President Bush met with Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu
last month to press the administration's case that Japan must do
more to open its markets to American goods.
   The deficit with Japan did decline in January to $2.9 billion,
its lowest level in five years, but it still remained by far the
biggest imbalance with a single country. The January improvement
came from a drop in imports to this country, not from a rise in
U.S. exports.
   Other big deficits in January included a $1.1 billion imbalance
with Taiwan, an $840 million deficit with China and a $628 million
deficit with Canada, America's largest trading partner.
   Analysts were encouraged that the increase in exports stemmed in
large part from a 13 percent jump in sales of manufactured capital
goods, an area where the United States is regaining ground
previously lost to foreign competitors.
   But on the import side, another factor swelling the deficit was
a 31 percent jump in clothing shipments, which totaled $3.1 billion
in January.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nursing home residents's personal funds would
gain protection under a regulation proposed Tuesday by the
Department of Health and Human Services.
   The proposed rule would prevent nursing homes from charging
residents for any goods or services not requested by the resident.
It also would bar nursing homes from requiring any applicant for
admission or resident to request specific items or services as a
condition of admission or continued stay.
   In addition, residents who request an item or service for which
they will be charged _ for example, a telephone, television or
radio for personal use _ must be told the amount of the charge,
under the proposed rule.
   The regulation would implement a law barring nursing facilities
from requiring payment from residents' personal funds for costs
covered by Medicare or Medicaid.
   The rule defines the circumstances under which residents can be
charged the difference between the Medicare payment and the
customary cost of an item or service when this cost is higher than
Medicare pays.
   Besides phones and TV sets, they include such goods and services
as nonmedical personal comfort items, beauty and barber items and
services that cost more than the Medicaid or Medicare payment,
personal clothing and services, reading material, flowers and
social and entertainment services.
   Also included would be special care services such as private
duty nurses, private rooms except when therapeutically required and
special foods that cost more than the foods provided to other
residents.
   The proposed regulation was published in Tuesday's Federal
Register. After a 60-day period for public comment, a final rule
will be published.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 5,000 rail workers went on strike Tuesday,
demanding that 1,406 former workers of the state-run railway be
given their jobs back.
   Those laid off by the Japanese Railways Liquidation Corp. are
among 7,628 employees of the former Japan National Railways who
were not rehired when the 277,000-member railroad was broken up
into seven private firms in April 1987.
   After the breakup, the workers were placed in a three-year
training program, scheduled to end this month. The plan was to have
the private rail firms hire the newly trained workers.
   The unemployed workers were hired by the liquidation firm on the
condition that they should find jobs in three years, said a company
official.
   National Railway Workers Union Kazuhiko Watanabe said 5,000
workers will go on strike again Wednesday to press their demand.
The union will strike again next week if its demand is not
accepted, Watanabe said.
   The National Railway Workers Union, which had 130,000 members
before the railroad became private, has only 37,000 members. Former
rail workers now belong to the new Japan Confederation of Railway
Worker Union, which has 140,000 members.

<TEXT>
   The government is examining a plan to
stem the flow of Third World refugees arriving through Poland on
phony documents, officials said Tuesday.
   The proposed plan, submitted to a government committee, would
make entry more difficult for refugees who arrive on their own
initiative rather than on U.N. refugee programs and quotas.
   It also called for increased diplomatic pressure on Poland to
check travel documents more closely. Sweden also may start
returning refugees to Poland after receiving assurances they are
treated in accordance with U.N. conventions.
   Hundreds of people from the Middle East and Africa have come to
Sweden from Poland in recent weeks requesting asylum. Virtually all
of them carry false documents, according to press reports.
   ``They are put in refugee camps pending individual handling of
their case which, unfortunately takes as much six to eight weeks,''
said police duty officer Carita Stahl.
   These people are ``ruthlessly exploited by refugee organizations
who have lured them into coming to Sweden at horrendous prices,''
said the Dagens Nyheter newspaper.
   The report said some refugees from Lebanon, Ethiopia, Somalia
and Iran had bought blurred photocopies of Swedish visas for
$600-$1,000 in Egypt, Turkey or Poland.
   In October, the government introduced visa requirements for
Bulgarians to halt a stream of thousands of ethnic Bulgarian Turks
that raised the number of asylum seekers in Sweden to the highest
level since World War II.
   Under Sweden's traditionally liberal immigration policies,
nearly 20,000 refugees move to Sweden every year.

<HEAD>House Backs Designation of Voting Rights March Route As Historic
Trail</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House approved legislation Tuesday
authorizing the National Park Service to determine whether the
route of the 1965 voting rights march from Selma to Montgomery
should be designated a national historic trail.
   Rep. John Lewis of Atlanta, who was severely beaten by Alabama
state troopers at the outset of the march, said the designation
would ``demonstrate our commitment to voting rights and ...
dramatize the importance of going to the polls and voting.''
   The legislation, which now goes to the Senate, was sponsored by
Lewis and endorsed by the Bush administration. It was approved
400-0 just one day before the 25th anniversary of the start of the
54-mile march from Browns Chapel Church in Selma to the Alabama
state capitol in Montgomery.
   The march, led by the late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., began
three weeks after Lewis and a group of 525 demonstrators were
attacked by Alabama state troopers as they reached the Edmund
Pettus Bridge in Selma while attempting to march to the state
capitol.
   ``We were confronted by billy clubs, bullwhips and tear gas,''
Lewis said. ``Women and children were trampled by deputies on
horseback.
   ``This day, which became known as Bloody Sunday, sent shock
waves around the world, raised the nation's consciousness and
convinced the political leaders that the time had come for voting
rights legislation,'' he said.
   Congress normally insists that at least 50 years must pass
before an event can be considered for historic designation, but
Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., said Bloody Sunday ``was one of those
events whose history, while infamous, was also instantaneous''
   Vento, chairman of the House interior subcommittee on national
parks and public lands, said the Selma-to-Montgomery march ``marks
a passage in the social history of our nation.''
   National Park Service officials enthusiastically endorsed Lewis'
bill at a hearing before Vento's panel three weeks ago. They
promised to find $150,000 in their existing budget to pay for the
study so it can be completed within one year.
   The law creating the national historic trail system requires
that the National Park Service conduct a study to determine if a
trail is of sufficient historical value to be marked and included
in the system before it can be so designated by Congress.
   Herbert Cables, deputy director of the park service, said the
agency wants to explore the possibility of putting together an oral
history of the march and creating exhibits and markers along the
route to interpret its significance to the public.

   Former President Jimmy Carter said
Tuesday that settling Soviet Jews in the occupied territories could
result in an international backlash that would hinder future
immigration.
   Also Tuesday, Soviet emigre and human rights activist Natan
Sharansky urged the government to end its censorship of Soviet
immigration figures, saying it was interfering with fund raising
and publicity efforts.
   Asked about settling some of the thousands of Soviet immigrants
coming to Israel in the occupied territories, Carter said:
   ``I believe that the number of Soviet Jews that will be
permitted to come to Israel is going to be dramatically reduced in
the future if these hopeful people coming to freedom are used to
establish facts (of Israeli presence) in occupied territories.''
   Carter added that he was concerned because such settlement was
``arousing animosity and opposition throughout the Arab world and
other places, in the Soviet Union and even in the United States.''
   Israel captured the West Bank and Arab east Jerusalem, along
with the Gaza Strip, from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East
War. Israel annexed east Jerusalem as part of its capital and has
set up a military government to rule the 1.7 million Palestinians
in the West Bank and Gaza.
   Israeli leaders have said they expect up to 750,000 Soviet
immigrants in the next few years.
   Carter made his comments at a news conference at Ben-Gurion
Airport at the end of a three-day visit to Israel. He visited
Egypt, Syria and Jordan earlier as part of a Middle East tour.
   Sharansky, a former Soviet ``refusenik'' who heads the Soviet
Jewry Zionist Forum, said some self-censorship might be necessary
to ensure the security of the immigrants.
   But he added: ``We need more support from world Jewry and, to
make (Israeli) bureaucrats work more effectively, we need more
public pressure. We can't do it under conditions of censorship.''
   Sharansky was joined in his appeal against censorship by
officials from the Jewish Agency, a quasi-government body that
shares responsibility for resettling immigrants.
   The agency's spokesman, Gad Ben-Ari said the organization was
appealing to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to have the broad
censorship guidelines limited to two key issues: long-term
immigration projections and new transit routes.
   ``The process of fund raising, especially in our Operation
Exodus campaign for the Soviets, depends a great deal on a constant
flow of accurate information about the immigration,'' Ben-Ari said.
``We are already having difficulties, not in fund raising but in
being able to deliver necessary information.''
   Operation Exodus aims to raise $200 million in each of the next
three years from Jews in the United States and Europe.
   The ban on publication of immigration figures was imposed by the
government on March 1 amid mounting Arab protests that the influx
could lead to more Jewish settlement in the Israeli-occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip, home to 1.7 million Palestinians.
   Israeli officials said the Arab statements raised the prospect
of guerrilla attacks against the immigrants, making censorship
necessary.
   Officials have said that Soviet Jews are not being directed to
settle in the occupied territories. About 200 Soviets settled in
the West Bank last year.

<HEAD>Press Cooperative Protests Gov't Decision to Liquidate It</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of Poland's largest press
cooperative said Tuesday the Solidarity-led government had acted
unfairly in deciding to liquidate it.
   Under Communist rule, the Workers' Publishing Cooperative
muzzled unauthorized publications. On Monday, the Cabinet decided
to do away with the group because it was seen as an organ of the
now-defunct Communist Party.
   Parliament must still pass the law dismantling the group.
   Slawomir Tabkowski, chairman of the cooperative, said the
government commission that developed the law had submitted to
``neo-Bolshevik pressure'' aimed at attaining ``political revenge.''
   He said the cooperative had gotten only a brief chance to
display its plans to reform itself, and the government had taken an
arbitrary decision.
   Under Communist rule, the party owned 95 percent of the
cooperative. Those assets were turned over to the Social Democracy
Party, which was created in January after the Communist Party
dissolved itself.
   A government statement carried by the PAP news agency said the
cooperative was ``an element of the structure of the political
monopoly of a single party.''
   ``An often unobjective and manipulatory impact on the
consciousness of the great masses of society ... was one of the
basic elements of that system,'' it said.
   To maintin the cooperative in the hands of the Social Democracy
Party ``would put it in a privileged position over the other
currently existing parties, unions, and associations,'' it said.
   The cooperative published the vast majority of newspapers on the
market, controlled the sale of newspapers through its monopoly on
more than 20,000 kiosks in the country and owned several important
publishing houses.
   Last year, the popularity of the cooperative's publications
began to drop as new independent newspapers and dailies emerged in
Poland's changing political climate.
   In a report published Monday in the Social Democracy Party's
newspaper Trybuna, the cooperative said that in January it
published 44 daily newspapers and a wide array of other
publications in the provinces.
   Its profits were a steady source of revenue for the Communists
and subsequently the Social Democracy Party. Tabkowski said the
cooperative had posted a profit of $10 million in 1989 and had 13
printing plants.
   Its monopoly on newspapers, along with censorship, prevented the
sale of underground literature which flourished after the 1981
martial law crackdown that crushed Solidarity.
   The kiosks began to distribute some independent publications,
but their shelves are still covered by the cooperative's newspapers
and magazines.
   Tabkowski said Tuesday that its abolition would reduce the array
of titles available to Polish readers.
   He said he would seek to retain some titles and would continue
business as usual. But he did not appear to have the support of the
workers who run the kiosks.
   Tabkowski said the cooperative has 39,000 employees, and another
38,000 work in the kiosks.
   As for the fate of the Trybuna newspaper, the Social Democracy
Party's official organ, party secretary Krzysztof Janik said it
might have to start publishing underground.

<HEAD>Texas Governor Hopeful Counts on Bush Coattails, Fund-Raising</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Republican millionaire Clayton Williams
said Tuesday he hopes to ride President Bush's coattails ``like a
bucking bronco'' to victory in an $11 million campaign for the
Texas governorship.
   The cowboy-oilman, who had lunch with Bush and Republican
National Chairman Lee Atwater at the White House, said Bush
promised to campaign actively for him and to help raise funds for
his campaign.
   ``I have asked him to come and help whenever and wherever he
can,'' Williams told reporters after his first-ever visit to the
Oval Office.
   Atwater said the president had no political trips to Texas
scheduled for the next month or so. But he said Bush ``made it
clear he will be coming to Texas and wants to help from a
fund-raising standpoint. Mrs. Bush also wants to help.''
   ``And let's face it,'' Atwater added, ``this is his (Bush's)
home state. He loves Texas. He loves the politics of Texas.''
   Atwater called Williams' chances of winning the election ``much
better than even... This guy is the political phenonomen of 1990.''
   Williams, speaking to reporters in the driveway outside the
White House, said he needed Bush's help in financing what he said
would amount to an $11 million campaign.
   The Texas businessman said he had already sunk $6.5 million of
his own money into his race and ``I'm about at the end of my rope.
If I put any more in... the bankers will eat me alive.''
   He said the president, who considers Houston his hometown, ``has
some wonderful coattails in Texas and I'd like to grab ahold of
them and ride them like a bucking bronco.''
   Asked which Democrat he would rather face in Novemember, state
Treasurer Ann Richards or Attorney General Jim Mattox, Williams
said: ``We'll take any one of them on. They both have strengths and
weaknesses. And we hope that each side will continue to point out
the weaknesses of the other side.''
   The two are in a runoff.
   Asked whether he would raise the issue of drugs if Richards wins
the runoff, Williams said: ``It will depend... My son was involved
in drugs. He spent 14 months in his rehabilitation. I admire any
person recovering from chemical dependency.''
   Richards, a recovering alcoholic, has refused to say whether she
ever used illegal drugs.
   Williams said he was making an effort to reach out to blacks,
Asian-Americans and Hispanics.
   ``I have an Anglo body but a heart that is Mexican-American,''
he said. ``I speak the language, working man's Spanish. I sing the
music. I have Mexican-Americans in my upper management... I'm proud
of my record in that arena.''
   And, he added, ``I met my wife in a Mexican restaurant.''
   Williams was invited to the White House last week after he
trounced three opponents to win his party's nomination to replace
retiring Republican Gov. Bill Clements.
   ``In a year like this, we can't afford to lose the governorship
of a state like Texas,'' Atwater said. ``Texas-California-Florida,
that is the three-mega-state anchor to our entire sunbelt political
base.''
   California and Florida, like Texas, have GOP governors whose
terms are up this year.

   Arson may have caused a supermarket fire in western
Japan that killed 15 people, a police official said Tuesday.
   Sunday's fire at the five-story Nagasakiya supermarket in
suburban Osaka, about 300 miles west of Tokyo, originated between a
wall and a pile of cushions on the fourth floor, said a police
official, who spoke on the condition he not be identified.
   ``We have not determined the cause of the fire yet, but the fire
may have been caused by arson or someone throwing away a cigarette
butt, considering the site where the fire started,'' the police
official said.
   He said police and fire officials investigating the fire are
questioning employees and shoppers who were on the fourth floor
when the blaze broke out.
   About 120 shoppers and 58 company employees were in the store at
the time. On Monday, police said they were investigating reports
about a man telephoning two major national newspapers saying he was
responsible.
   The Asahi Shimbun reported a man called their office in Kobe and
said ``I set the fire. I didn't think it would turn into such a
disaster. I was frustrated because I had been fired.''
   The official would not comment Tuesday on the police
investigation.

   Gov. Terry Branstad apologized for
joking that one solution to child poverty is for the rich to have
more kids, but insisted he is not insensitive to the plight of the
poor.
   The Republican governor said he doesn't regret having a sense of
humor. But he told reporters Monday it was wrong to say ``the rich
get richer and the poor have children.''
   He made the crack several weeks ago during a Kiwanis Club
meeting after he gave a more serious response about what could be
done for children living in poverty.
   A columnist for The Des Moines Register publicized Branstad's
joke Friday. After initially defending his remark at his weekly
news conference Monday, Branstad changed gears minutes later.
   ``In retrospect, I think it was a mistake,'' said Branstad, who
is running for re-election in November. ``It's not a funny topic.
I'm sorry that I said that in humor.''
   Democratic gubernatorial candidate Don Avenson claimed the
remark reflected Branstad's lack of concern for the poor.
   But Branstad said his administration has started welfare reform
programs and directed money to school programs for poor children.
``I'm committed to seeing that's done,'' Branstad said. ``I think
we need to do all that we can.''
   ``The state has taken significant action and will continue to
take action to help people move from poverty and dependency to job
opportunities and a higher standard of living,'' Branstad said.
``That's what this system is all about, to help people.''

<TEXT>
   The Colorado Department of Health has cited the
federal Drug Enforcement Administration for violating state air
pollution standards by burning a half ton of cocaine in an
incinerator last month.
   DEA officials expressed outrage Monday at being issued a
``notice of violation'' for burning 1,042 pounds of contraband
cocaine on Feb. 23 in a U.S. Department of Agriculture incinerator
in Lakewood, a suburb of Denver.
   ``What do they think we're going to do with it _ ship it back to
Colombia?'' asked DEA spokesman Ron Hollingshead.
   Hollingshead said at first he thought a phone call about the
alleged violation was a joke.
   Harry Collier, a state air pollution control specialist, said
the department acted after receiving several complaints about a
dense column of smoke when the cocaine was burned.
   The DEA used the incinerator because it could burn the drug at a
temperature exceeding 800 degrees, Hollingshead said. The high
temperature was needed to keep the cocaine burn from turning into
``the world's biggest crack cookout,'' he said.
   Collier said the DEA could have found other incinerators that
would have complied with the clean air law.

   Eleven years later than they hoped,
operators of the Seabrook nuclear power plant turned on its reactor
Tuesday to begin running it up to full power.
   At 3:59 a.m., the 1,150-megawatt reactor achieved its first
sustained chain reaction since low-power tests in 1989, spokesman
Ron Sher said. He said the reactor operated at a fraction of 1
percent of full power shortly after engineers partially withdrew
some of the 57 control rods.
   ``There is a real sense of accomplishment because everyone at
Seabrook Station who has worked so hard can now continue the job
that we have been organized to do: that's prepare to generate
much-needed electricity for more than 1 million New England
homes,'' Sher said.
   In a nuclear chain reaction, neutrons released by spontaneously
dividing uranium atoms split other uranium atoms, releasing more
energy and more neutrons. Control rods interrupt that process by
absorbing neutrons.
   The reactor will be allowed to increase power to 100 percent
during the next two to three months, Sher said. A limited amount of
electricity will be produced at about 10 percent, but until then
operators will shunt steam past the turbines that eventually will
drive electrical generators.
   The $6.5 billion plant, finished in mid-1986 after years of
protests, got its Nuclear Regulatory Commission operating license
last week, following lengthy regulatory battles and a preliminary
court skirmish decided in Seabrook's favor.
   The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington declined last week to
block the license pending further court action, but still has
before it an appeal filed by the Massachusetts attorney general,
Seacoast Anti-Pollution League and New England Coalition on Nuclear
Pollution.
   Public Service Co. of New Hampshire proposed building a nuclear
power plant on the New Hampshire seacoast in 1968. The company
revived the project in 1972 with a plan to build two 1,150-megawatt
reactors at Seabrook for a total cost of $973 million. The first
was to operate in 1979, the second in 1981.
   Beset by construction delays, increased safety requirements
after the partial meltdown of the Three Mile Island reactor in
1979, regulatory snags and opposition by neighboring Massachusetts,
owners mothballed Seabrook's second reactor in the mid-1980s.

   The Army is gambling that Congress will agree
to end tank production while also approving money for controversial
new weapons systems such as the LH attack helicopter, senior
Pentagon officials said Tuesday.
   Steven Conver, assistant Army secretary for research and
acquisition, told a House panel that the Army reluctantly proposed
abandoning the M-1 Abrams tank production line and the Apache attak
helicopter because of the overall squeeze on defense spending.
   Conver said he recognized that it might be difficult persuading
Congress to halt tank production while also spending on new weapons
systems such as the LH, or light helicopter, which the Pentagon
itself has begun reassessing.
   ``I realize the political difficulty,'' Conver told the House
Armed Services subcommittee on procurement. ``We're really throwing
the dice on that one.''
   The difficulty made itself apparent during the hearing.
Legislators who stand to lose coveted military contracts for their
districts protested the cuts in current Army programs. Others,
concerned about the costs involved in new weapons programs,
questioned the need for developing new tanks and helicopters.
   ``I sense a disconnect between where the administration is going
and where the Congress is going on modernization,'' said Armed
Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis.
   Rep. Marvin Leath, D-Texas, who said he had no parochial
interest in the cancellation of the M-1 or Apache, said, ``I don't
know how you think it's fine to just destroy a production base.''
   Gen. Donald Pihl, the Army's top acquisition officer, responded:
``It is not comforting to think about the United States of America
not producing tanks.''
   Rep. John Rowland, R-Conn., suggested that rather than spending
$400 million to mothball the two existing tank factories in the
United States _ one in Detroit and the other in Lima, Ohio _ the
Army should continue to make a small number of M-1s and promote
tank sales to foreign countries.
   The LH program would last into the next century and cost about
$3 billion per year. Each helicopter, with the latest in
target-seeking and radar-avoiding technology, would cost about $7.5
million. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney last week ordered a
high-level Pentagon review of the need for the LH.
   Some members of Congress also are uncertain about the need for
new light helicopters.
   ``How can you realistically expect the Congress to approve these
levels of funding for a single helicopter program, particularly one
of questionable value?'' asked Rep. Larry Hopkins, R-Ky.
   Conver replied that ``we are not even a little bit apologetic
about asking Congress for this program.''

   Audrey Hepburn's recital from the diary of
Anne Frank gave a wondrous glimpse into the young Holocaust
victim's ``hopes, her youthful dreams, her reality,'' composer
Michael Tilson Thomas said.
   The 60-year-old actress, who is goodwill ambassador for the
United Nation's Children's Fund, read from the diary in the first
of four ``Concerts for Life'' Monday night to benefit the world's
needy children.
   The diary chronicled the Jewish girl's feelings as she and her
family hid from the Nazis for two years in the attic of an
Amsterdam office building. Published in 1947, it later was made
into a play and then a movie. Miss Hepburn turned down both roles,
saying they were too emotional upsetting.
   ``I couldn't deal with it, I could not exploit her,'' said Miss
Hepburn, who lived in Holland during World War II and was the same
age as Anne Frank.
   Miss Hepburn finally relented by collaborating on Thomas'
musical tribute, ``From the Diary of Anne Frank,'' which premiered
before an emotionally charged audience of 2,400 at the Academy of
Music.
   ``This is certainly one of the best experiences of my life,''
Miss Hepburn said. ``The words of Anne Frank have lived this long;
and in this music, they will live forever.''
   ``It was as if you were listening to Anne Frank, her hopes, her
youthful dreams, her reality,'' Thomas told reporters.
   Other concerts are planned for Wednesday in Chicago, Friday in
Houson and Sunday at the United Nations.

   Lou Diamond Phillips has been released
from the hospital where he was treated for a broken arm. The actor
suffered the injury after being thrown and dragged by a horse on
the movie set of ``Young Guns 2.'' The Philippines-born actor
received at least 20 floral arrangements, dozens of get-well cards
and phone calls from fans during his weekend stay at University of
New Mexico Hospital.
   Spokeswoman Gail Sutton said Phillips, 28, left the hospital
Monday evening. A gunshot startled the horse Phillips was riding
Friday on a movie set near Galisteo, 20 miles from Santa Fe. His
fractured right arm required 2{ hours of surgery.
   Phillips, best known for his roles as singer Ritchie Valens in
``La Bamba'' and as a defiant math student in ``Stand and
Deliver,'' was returning home Tuesday to Los Angeles, said his
publicist, Eddie Michaels.
   Ms. Sutton said telephone calls to Phillips were carefully
screened, but a few who falsely claimed to be relatives got
through. ``A couple of little kids dropped off cards,'' she said.
   Phillips is playing Jose Chavez y Chavez, a friend of Billy the
Kid, in the ``Young Guns'' movies. Emilio Estevez plays the Kid.

   A judge ordered Billy Barty to pay one of his
former writers $1,300, and the diminutive actor was jubilant.
   The 65-year-old Barty, who has starred in such films as
``Rumpelstiltskin'' and ``Willow,'' said he was happy with Monday's
ruling because he didn't have to award 10 percent of future
syndication profits for his show ``Short Ribbs'' to writer-producer
Bill Winckler.
   ``It went fine, it went very good, I was very pleased at the
judge's decision,'' Barty said being ordered to pay Winckler $1,300
in disputed salary and $28 in court costs.
   Barty said the publicity hadn't hurt his career.
   ``This has gotten about as much publicity as Zsa Zsa and I
didn't even slap anybody,'' he said. ``But I wouldn't slap anybody.
I'd hit them in the knee.''
   Winckler, who sued Barty in small claims court for $2,000, said
he also was satisfied.
   ``I would have liked to have had my 10 percent of the show, too,
but I'm not overly upset about it because I don't know how
marketable the show is now,'' he said.
   Thirteen episodes of ``Short Ribbs,'' described as a ``Saturday
Night Live'' for ``Little People,'' were televised last fall on
Orange County-based cable station KDOC.
   Winckler, a writer for television cartoons, said he agreed to
the relatively paltry fee of $100 per episode because he figured he
stood to make a good deal more with 10 percent of the syndication
fee. But he said Barty wouldn't pay him anything after the two fell
out over creative differences.

   Bill Demby, a Vietnam War veteran who lost
both legs in a rocket attack in 1971, tells youngsters that his
disabilities don't stop him from enjoying life to the full.
   The former army private features in a television commercial by
Du Pont, which manufactures a plastic used in his artificial legs.
He travels around the country, often to cities with Du Pont plants,
to offer hard-earned advice to high school students.
   ``I hope kids can find something in my story that will help them
out when times get hard,'' he said during a visit Monday to Omaha
Northwest High School. ``Maybe when they see my life, they'll
realize that they're not so bad off.''
   Demby said he cannot run as fast as before, nor can he jump as
high.
   ``But I get out there and play,'' he said, ``and if you give me
half a chance, I'll burn the nets off you.''
   After returning from the war, Demby said he fell into a cycle of
drug and alcohol abuse until, one night in a bar, a friend told him
``You don't need this.'' Since then, Demby said, he has made a
slow, steady recovery.
   ``Sometimes you've just got to kick yourself in the rear and get
going,'' he said.

   President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia said
Tuesday that his country's venerable arms industry will no longer
sell weapons to dictatorial or totalitarian regimes.
   Czechoslovakia, a major arms manufacturer since before World War
II, has sold sophisticated explosives to countries, and they have
found their way to terrorists.
   ``Today, we stop all arms sales to dictatorial or totalitarian
countries,'' Havel said at a news conference near the end of his
two-day official visit to France. He did not say which nations he
had in mind.
   ``We are studying reconversion of our military industry,'' Havel
said. ``Don't hold it against us if we continue to furnish arms for
a little while to democratic countries.''
   Havel answered questions at the Elysee Palace at the side of
President Francois Mitterrand. The visit was Havel's first to
France since becoming Czechslovakia's leader in December.
   The Czech leader promised not to resort to autocracy to resolve
the economic problems facing his country after four decades of
Communist rule.
   ``The process before us does not have historic precedence,''
Havel said. ``There are different economic theories and different
economists, so there is a divergence of points of view.''
   Havel promised that a draft bill will be submitted to the
country's Assembly for approval in coming weeks dealing with
economic readjustment and the tricky question of private property.
   Mitterrand announced no new aid or foreign policy programs for
Czechoslovakia beyond saying that France ``will without doubt
assist President Vaclav Havel.''
   The Czech president is trying to raise his country's profile in
the West after decades of dominance by the Soviets. He visited the
United States last month and travels to London on Wednesday for
talks with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

   Providing health care for all pregnant women
and children would lead to healthier babies with fewer needs for
costly special care later in life, witnesses told a House
subcommittee Tuesday.
   The short-term costs of expanding care would be high, medical
and health policy experts agreed, but the long-term payoff would be
lower costs for expensive high-tech care later on.
   ``It costs taxpayers and private businesses more money if
pregnant woman can't get medical care,'' said former Sen. Lawton
Chiles, D-Fla., chairman of the National Commission to Prevent
Infant Mortality.
   Without adequate prenatal care, a woman is more likely to
deliver a low birthweight baby that might need costly medical
services to survive.
   Increasing the birthweight of one such infant from two pounds to
2.5 pounds would save $17,000 in acute inpatient hospital care,
Chiles told the House Ways and Means subcommittee on health.
   Extending that savings to the entire U.S. population would
result in immediate savings of as much as $90 billion, he said,
``and that does not even begin to address the long-term savings in
health care, school failure and lost productivity.''
   Sen. Pete Stark, D-Calif., subcommittee chairman, has introduced
a bill that would provide publicly-financed health insurance to all
children through age 22 and pregnancy-related health services for
all women.
   The net cost of the package would be about $50 billion a year.
   ``When Medicare was passed in 1965, it provided
publicly-financed health insurance for the elderly,'' Stark said.
``The time has come to provide similar coverage for the other most
vulnerable groups within our society _ children and mothers.''
   Fifteen percent of the 3.7 million women who give birth each
year have no health insurance to pay for maternity care, Richard
Schwarz, vice president of the American College of Obstetricians
and Gynecologists, said in testimony submitted to the panel. Of
those who do have insurance, about 330,000 of them have policies
that don't cover maternity services, he said.
   An estimated 11 million children lack health insurance. Studies
have shown that these children are about 20 percent more likely to
be reported in poor health as are children who are insured or on
Medicaid, Birt Harvey, president of the American Academy of
Pediatrics, said in his testimony.
   About 300,000 infants die or are born with low birthweight every
year, said Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., chairman of the House
Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families.
   ``The answer is not difficult,'' Miller said in testimony before
the subcommittee. ``This isn't a secret formula we're groping for.
It's an attitude'' that pregnant women and children are entitled to
health care, he said.

<HEAD>Senators Urge ABA Removal From Judicial Selection Process</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four Republican senators say the American Bar
Association, by endorsing abortion rights, has forfeited its role
in selecting federal judges.
   ``The time has come to end the ABA's preferred role in judicial
selection. We hereby strongly urge you take steps ... to terminate
the official relationship with the ABA,'' the senators said in a
letter to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh.
   The letter signed by Sens. Charles Grassley of Iowa, Orrin Hatch
of Utah, Gordon Humphrey of New Hampshire and Alan Simpson of
Wyoming was written Monday but was not made public until Tuesday.
   The ABA is the nation's largest lawyers' organization. Its
policy-making House of Delegates voted last month to oppose
legislattal action threatening a woman's right to
abortion.
   Thornburgh subsequentlion or governmeny said the resolution could bias
the ABA's
ability to judge the professsional competence of judicial nominees.
   ``We share your publicly expressed view that positions such as
these call into question the ABA's privileged role on judicial
selection,'' the senators told Thornburgh.
   The four, all conservative members of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, have been critical of the ABA's role in the fight over
Robert H. Bork, nominated to the Supreme Court in 1987 by PreMaine, lawyer
who heads the
ABA federal judiciary panel, rejected the letter's premise.
   ``Our evaluation focuses, as it always has, only on three
factors: professional competence, judicial temperament and
integrity,'' he said.
   ``We have no `litmus test' and do not consider the views of the
potential nominees on particular policy issues,'' Lancaster said.
``The ABA has adopted over 750 policy positions on legislative
issues. None of these is now _ or will be _ a factor in the
standing committee's evaluation'' of nominees.
   There was no immediate reaction from Thornburgh. But when
Justice Department spokesman David Runkel was asked Monday to
comment, he told reporters the controversy created by the ABA
abortion vote ``is still an open issue.''

<TEXT>
   Upset by recent developments at Random House,
James Michener says he may leave the publisher in favor of what he
calls ``some small house obedient to the old traditions.''
   The prolific novelist, who has had more than 30 books published
by Random House, issued a statement Monday in which he said he had
been ``devastated by the series of hammer blows my company has
suffered in recent months.''
   The writer cited the forced resignation of Robert Bernstein as
president of Random House; Bernstein's replacement with Alberto
Vitale, whom Michener described as ``not a man reared in the
traditions of American publishing;'' and the forced resignation of
Andre Schiffrin as managing director of Pantheon Books, a Random
House subsidiary.
   Michener also expressed concern about possible layoffs at Random
House.
   Michener, author of ``Hawaii'' and many other best-sellers,
described himself as ``one of Random House's oldest and most loyal
writers.'' He urged Vitale and S.I. Newhouse, whose family owns
Random House, to ``step forward and define their understanding of
how the world's major English-language publisher should conduct its
business.'' If they do, he added, ``I will sign a new contract with
a sigh of relief.''
   Vitale expressed dismay over Michener's remarks and said he was
willing to discuss them with the writer. Newhouse said he had no
comment on Michener's statement.

<HEAD>EPA Audtiors Review Handling of Case Involving Tooth Fillings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmental Protection Agency auditors are
reviewing the agency's handling of an unusual case that put the
bite on dozens of dentists because they sold old fillings whose
toxic ingredients ended up in the soil.
   The case has attracted the attention of lawmakers because it
tests how far the government can reach to hold parties accountable
for toxic waste contamination.
   Last week, the EPA inspector general's office said it was
assigning auditors to conduct a 60-day review of the case before
determining whether additional study was necessary. The review
comes at the request of a Pittsburgh dental supplier who claims the
agency overstepped its authority.
   The case hinges on amalgam _ the stuff that fillings are made of
_ and whether it can be considered a ``hazardous substance'' after
it has been removed from peoples' teeth.
   Amalgam is a hard, durable alloy. Dentists often save old
fillings or leftover amalgam and sell it to processors, who break
it down into mercury or silver.
   The EPA alleged in 1987 and 1988 that Pittsburgh dental
suppliers Roy Ott, his son Ken, and other companies sold amalgam to
metal processor Eugene Bourdeaudhui. As a result of Bourdeaudhui's
efforts to break the amalgam down, the agency said soil in
Willington, Conn., became so polluted with toxic mercury that it
required a $710,000 cleanup in 1985.
   In seeking out responsible parties to pay for the cleanup, the
EPA stunned the nationwide dental community by going after not only
Bourdeaudhui but also 58 dentists and several dental suppliers who
did business with him.
   All the parties have settled with EPA, according to attorney
Robert Ging of Confluence, Pa. His clients, the Otts, agreed last
November to pay the government $30,000 because they said the
expense of further legal challenges was too great.
   In announcing several of the settlements last year, the EPA said
the agreements ``demonstrate that members of the dental community
understand that they have a responsibility to make themselves aware
of dental amalgam's ultimate disposal method and that the dental
community _ which controls the disposition of waste amalgam _
rather than taxpayers, should bear the cost of cleanup.''
   But Ging said in an interview Tuesday that the principle
involved compelled the Otts last month to ask EPA Inspector General
John C. Martin to review the case.
   ``Mr. Ott and his son were so offended by the waste and the
injustice of the whole procedure that they felt it ws worth their
time and effort to bring this to the attention of the Congress and
the people,'' Ging said.
   Several lawmakers agreed with the Otts that the case raised
basic fairness questions.
   ``The fact that dental amalgam is considered a hazardous waste
under Superfund comes as a surprise to many,'' said Rep. Doug
Walgren, D-Pa., in a letter last year to EPA. ``A substance which
is in my mouth _ and the mouths of millions of Americans _ and is
deemed `safe' by dentists and the American Dental Association
hardly seems a candidate for Superfund coverage.''
   Walgren also said it ignored ``a common sense standard of
reasonableness'' to hold Ott and the dentists responsible for the
actions of a ``third party'' in Connecticut.
   Through the Freedom of Information Act, the Otts obtained EPA
documents they said demonstrated excessive charges by contractors
for the cleanup.
   ``We share your concern that contractors may be charging
excessive fees under the Superfund law,'' Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich. and chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee,
said in a letter to the family several weeks ago.

   Former Secretary of State George P.
Shultz has joined critics of the Bush administration who say the
United States should take a more active role in shaping the future
of Eastern Europe.
   But Shultz cautioned against promoting independence movements in
the Soviet Union beyond the Baltic states.
   In an interview at his on-campus office last week, he also
warned against the United States aggravating the Middle East peace
process, saying President Bush must make it clear he does not
support dividing Jerusalem.
   Reluctant to criticize the Bush administration since leaving
office last year, Shultz, 69, has busied himself on several
projects at the Hoover Institution in Stanford University.
   He lives here with his wife, and still carries the worn brown
leather briefcase, bulging with papers, that he hauled around the
globe during 6{ years as President Reagan's secretary of state.
   Instead of meeting daily with world leaders, Shultz is writing
about his years in Washington, discussing political and economic
events with other Hoover scholars and Stanford students and
developing material for a book and some television documentaries on
foreign policy, called ``Statecraft.''
   In a discussion of recent developments in foreign affairs,
Shultz did not directly criticize Secretary of State James Baker's
plan to allow participation of East Jerusalem Arabs in talks with
Israel.
   But he indicated some dissatisfaction with the plan, which
triggered a dispute and shakeup in the Israeli government, and
comments by Bush suggesting East Jerusalem was part of occupied
territory with Israeli settlers.
   ``I think it's very important for us not to condition the
atmosphere by taking stands that tend to aggravate the situation
unnecessarily,'' Shultz said. ``There is no point in giving anyone
the sense that we in any way support dividing Jerusalem.''
   Shultz said ``diplomacy has become a neglected dimension of the
Arab-Israeli conflict.''
   He suggested the United States take a lead in shaping events in
Eastern Europe.
   ``It seems to me when things are changing in directions that are
congenial to us, and the balls are up in the air in great
multitude, it is a time to be leaning forward into the task of
diplomacy and engaging with these problems,'' Shultz said.
   ``The United States has had a great part in creating these
changes and we have a great stake in the way they work out,'' he
said. ``So we're not an onlooker only. We have been a participant
and we want to retain our ability to affect what goes on.''
   Several Democratic leaders have complained the Bush
administration has not responded vigorously enough to changes in
Eastern Europe. Shultz said U.S. and European officials should heed
the lessons of history.
   ``We should remember that at the end of World War I, the
statesmen then designed a system (in Europe) that didn't work,'' he
said. ``After World War II, the statesmen who were the most
influential, and they were from the United States, designed a
system that did work.
   ``That doesn't mean we have to thump our chests about it. Our
friends had a lot to do with it, too,'' Shultz said. ``But the U.S.
influence has been a very positive one. We have paid our dues.''
   Shultz said the United States must tread delicately over whether
to encourage independence movements among the Soviet republics. The
United States has long encouraged or supported freedom efforts in
other countries, he said.
   ``That doesn't mean we go around supporting armed insurrection
everywhere, but we promote'' freedom, he said. ``That's what we
stand for. I suppose that's one reason why the Chinese are always
edgy about us.
   Aside from the Baltic republics, where the United States has a
longstanding position of not recognizing their incorporation into
the Soviet Union, ``it's not for us to promote any particular
rearrangement of the Soviet Union,'' he said. ``But the people
there will be better served if they have a right to ...
self-expression about these matters.''
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev has ``a whole set of
tremendous problems,'' Shultz said. ``He clearly has to create a
looser federal system in the Soviet Union than the one they've
got.''

   Police and federal agents hunted for
clues Tuesday in the wreckage of an apartment where a shoebox-size
package bomb killed a 70-year-old man wintering in Florida with his
family.
   Sherwin William Finlay, a boating enthusiast from Missouri, was
killed when a package left at the door of his rented apartment
exploded when he picked it up, said Sgt. Steve Weintraub of the
Jacksonville Sheriff's Office.
   Finlay had just moved to the apartment about a week before with
his 67-year-old wife, Dorothy, and daughter Gay Lynn Meek, 35, who
were not injured. They said they had no idea why anyone would want
to kill Finlay.
   Investigators do not believe the explosion is related to recent
mail bombings that killed two people in Alabama, Georgia and
Jacksonville.
   The blast Monday was powerful enough to blow out the roof
overhang of the two-story apartment building.
   Willi Ellison, agent in charge of the Jacksonville office of the
U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said the bomb was
``more or less a homemade device.'' Its remains were to be sent to
the ATF laboratory in Atlanta for analysis, he said.
   All 10 agents at his office were investigating the bombing,
along with the sheriff's office, he said.
   ``We want to find out who committed this crime,'' Ellison said.
   The brown-paper package was not delivered by the U.S. Post
Office as were package bombs that killed a federal appeals court
judge, Robert Vance, and Savannah, Ga., alderman Robert Robinson
last December, Ellison said.
   ``At this point, I don't think there is a connection but we're
looking into all aspects,'' Ellison said.
   Unlike the bombs that killed Vance and Robinson, the device did
not contain nails as shrapnel, he said. Shrapnel devices also were
sent to the Jacksonville office of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People and the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Atlanta, but both were disarmed.
   The family is from Gravois Mills, Mo., where Finlay worked for
the Missouri Highway Department for 20 years before retiring 10
years ago.
   A friend, Bryan Taylor, said he and Finlay had sailed together
for more than two decades as members of the Lake of the Ozarks
Yachting Association. Taylor described him as an unlikely target
and said the Finlays had planned a boat trip through the
Intracoastal Waterway to Jacksonville, where their son, Doug, is a
boat salesman.
   Weintraub said the couple had been in Jacksonville since Dec. 1.
They moved into the apartment complex about a week ago, and
neighbors knew little about them.
   The FBI is monitoring the case, said George Wisnovsky, an agency
spokesman.

   President Bush pressed Congress Tuesday to
move quickly on his $800 million aid package for Panama and
Nicaragua, but it became increasingly clear that there were serious
obstacles to action before the president's Easter deadline.
   Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger told a Senate
Appropriations subcommittee that the aid is crucial to the survival
of new democratic governments headed by President Guillermo Endara
in Panama and President-elect Violeta Chamorro in Nicaragua.
   ``Early success ... is going to be fundamental to whether Mr.
Endara and Mrs. Chamorro are going to make it,'' Eagleburger told
the foreign aid subcommittee.
   At the White House, Bush gave visiting congressional leaders
another reason to act quickly: to turn up heat on Cuba's Fidel
Castro, the hemisphere's lone communist holdout.
   ``I'm terribly disappointed that Castro seems to be firming up
his totalitarian position instead of moving toward free and fair
elections,'' Bush said while reporters were present for a
picture-taking session.
   ``I'd like to see him shift from that highly militarized island
and let democracy have a chance,'' said Bush. ``I think if we are
helpful to Nicaragua and Panama, it will simply increase the
pressure in that marvelous island of Cuba for change.''
   On Capitol Hill, Eagleburger sought to reassure senators about
the need for the aid package and to press them on its urgency.
   For Panama, where the administration is seeking $500 million,
the money is a one-shot economic boost, he said. The administration
does not expect to come back next year for still more money,
Eagleburger told them.
   Nicaragua's $300 million would not begin to flow until the
current leftist government of Sandinista President Daniel Ortega
fully turns over power to Chamorro, he added.
   But he seemed to acknowledge the tough job ahead, and several
members of the panel pointed to a thicket of potential problems
that could delay the package beyond April 5, when Congress recesses
for Easter.
   ``We won. We got what we wanted'' in Nicaragua and Panama,
Eagleburger said. ``Now we are going to see if we have what it
takes to sustain what we helped to start. We may be about to learn
that winning was the easy part.''
   The most immediate problem is how the package will be paid for.
The administration has proposed a list of cuts in Pentagon spending
to free money for the aid bill, but is still negotiating with
Congress over which programs should be cut. Sen. Robert Kasten,
R-Wis., said he believed those talks would be completed in the next
two days.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the subcommittee chairman, said it
was almost certain that opponents of U.S. military aid to El
Salvador would seek cuts in aid as a signal of displeasure over
that government's failure so far to bring to justice the killers of
six Jesuit priests.
   Nicaragua itself still must find a way to reintegrate the Contra
rebels, who have fought the government for the past decade, into
peaceful society. The U.S. government says there now are 15,000
Contra fighters and 45,000 family members, most of them in
Honduras, who need to be repatriated.
   Eagleburger acknowledged that suspicions are deep on both sides
and that all the rebels are unlikely to lay down their weapons and
move back by Chamorro's April 25 inauguration. The package includes
some $42 million for Contra repatriation, and anti-Contra lawmakers
will likely want to debate that issue.
   And Leahy accused the administration of having its priorities
wrong, suggesting he might seek to divert some of the money to help
bolster fledgling democracies in Eastern Europe. Nicaragua and
Panama are of ``slight economic, security and foreign policy
importance'' compared to Europe, he asserted.
   A spate of other amendments also awaits the bill, including a
Kasten-Leahy proposal to offer $400 million in housing loan
guarantees to Israel to build accommodations for Soviet Jews moving
there under the Soviet Union's relaxed emigration policies.
   Eagleburger seemed to soften the administration's position on
that proposal, saying it would support the idea ``on the assumption
that we can obtain adequate assurances with regard to those funds''
on Israel's plans for settlements in the occupied territories. The
statement was less categorical about needed assurances than recent
statements by Bush and by Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   In addition, as the first must-pass legislation to come along in
this year's congressional session, the Panama-Nicaragua bill will
become a popular target for pet projects of lawmakers. Dozens of
members already have indicated an interest in offering amendments.
   ``It seems to me we have to establish the emergency nature of
this ... in a stronger way,'' said Kasten. ``Right now there is not
enough of an emergency nature to this total package.''

<TEXT>
   The White House expressed concern Tuesday
about Soviet troop movements around the breakaway republic of
Lithuania, urging the Kremlin to avoid creating ``an atmosphere of
intimidation and increasing tension.''
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We don't
have any indication of forcible control being exerted.'' However,
he added, the troop movements ``are cause for concern and they do
precipitate a little higher level of interest on our part.''
   The statement was triggered by Soviet military maneuvers in and
around Lithuania and the beefing up of Soviet security around
state-run factories and power plants.
   The Soviet moves apparently were designed to prevent Lithuanian
leaders from carrying out their declared intention of taking full
control of government property.
   The Bush administration's statement was met by a new pledge from
Moscow that it would not use force in the Baltic republics, even
though it rejects Lithuania's vote to secede from the Soviet Union.
   ``We are against the use of force in any region and particularly
against the use of force domestically,'' said Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, standing alongside Secretary of State
James A. Baker III in Namibia during a celebration of its
independence from South Africa.
   Baker commented, ``The minister has said that on a number of
occasions.''
   The United States has never recognized the forced incorporation
of Lithuanian or the Baltic states of Estonia and Latvia into the
Soviet Union in 1940.
   On the other hand, the United States has not responded to
Lithuania's declaration of independence by granting formal
diplomatic recognition. Fitzwater referred in his statement to
``the Lithuanian government'' but said that was not intended to
imply a change in policy.
   The U.S. course has been to urge Lithuania and the Soviet Union
to negotiate a peaceful settlement for the future of the republic.
   In contrast to the expression of concern voiced by Fitzwater
over the troop movements, President Bush praised Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev for his restraint on Lithuania.
   ``I'm glad that they're (the Soviets) still talking peaceful
change,'' Bush said, replying to reporters' questions during a
meeting with congressional leaders. ``That's essential and they've
been very good about it _ the Soviets have all through Eastern
Europe.''
   Bush added, ``We want to see democracy and freedom. We want to
see self-determination. And we also want to see peaceful
evolution.''
   He said he had discussed the issue previously with Gorbachev. An
administration official said Bush and Gorbachev, at their summit in
Malta, talked about ``Soviet non-use of force in the Baltics and
Eastern Europe.'' The official said Gorbachev assured Bush that
force would not be used.
   The press secretary, reading from a prepared statement, said,
``We continue to urge a constructive dialogue'' between Lithuanian
and Soviet leaders.
   ``This would be complicated by an atmosphere of intimidation and
increasing tension,'' he said. ``In this regard, the activities and
statements of the Soviet government over the past few days are
cause for concern. We are watching the situation closely.''
   Fitzwater said he did not expect the issue to mar prospects for
a summit between Bush and Gorbachev this summer. ``I don't
anticipate any cloud at this time in any way.''

<TEXT>
   Opponents of the most restrictive U.S.
abortion law are organizing in hopes of persuading voters in this
territory to overturn the measure in November.
   A court test of a section of the new law already was under way
Wednesday, less than 48 hours after Gov. Joseph Ada signed the
bill, which was unanimously passed March 8 by the Pacific Ocean
island's Legislature.
   The law prohibits abortions except when a pregnancy endangers
the life of the mother. It makes it a third-degree felony to
perform an abortion or aid in the procedure, a misdemeanor for a
woman to solicit or have an abortion and a misdemeanor for a person
to solicit a woman to have an abortion.
   Janet Benshoof, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's
Reproductive Freedom Project in New York, was to be arraigned
Wednesday on a misdemeanor charge of solicitation to commit
abortion.
   During a speech Tuesday at the Guam Press Club, Benshoof urged
woman needing an abortion to travel to Honolulu for the procedure.
   ``I was very specific in my breaking of the law,'' Benshoof
said. ``The information that I gave, which is now a crime, came
from the Honolulu Yellow Pages.''
   Two investigators from the territorial attorney general's office
taped the speech, and Attorney General Elizabeth Barrett-Anderson
filed the charge later in the day. Benshoof faces up to a year in
jail and a $1,000 fine if convicted.
   The attorney general had advised the Legislature before the vote
that the measure is unconstitutional. After the governor signed it,
she said, ``it is not my duty to decide the statute's
constitutionality but to enforce it.''
   A pro-choice group, Guamanians for Self-Determination, set an
organizational meeting for Thursday and pledged to fight the law.
The meeting was scheduled by about 35 women who met following
Benshoof's speech Tuesday.
   The law sets a referendum for the 130,000 residents of this
island about 1,500 miles east of the Philippines to decide whether
to keep the law.
   The issue of giving advice about abortions also was involved in
a federal appeals court ruling in Boston on Tuesday.
   The 1st Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that a federal
regulation that prohibits government-funded family planning clinics
from discussing abortion with clients is an unconstitutional
infringement on freedom of speech.
   The court said the speech at issue involves telling a woman
about an activity ``in which she has a constitutional right to
engage.''
   Elsewhere, Idaho's state Senate put off until Thursday a vote on
what could become the most restrictive abortion law of any state.
Supporters and opponents expect the bill to pass. Gov. Cecil Andrus
has said he is anti-abortion but has refused to say whether he will
sign or veto the measure.
   A filibuster in the Maryland Senate against an abortion-rights
bill continued for sixth day on Tuesday. The bill would allow
unrestricted abotions until a fetus is old enough to survive
outside the womb.
   In Laredo, Texas, the City Council on Monday passed a resolution
stating that life begins at conception. While a resolution is
merely an expression of the council's opinion, an anti-abortion
activist said he'll push for a city anti-abortion ordinance.
   Benshoof came to Guam on Sunday in hopes of dissuading Ada from
signing the bill. She was unable to arrange a meeting with the
governor.
   ``This is an issue that effects all women in the United States,
not just Guam,'' she said.
   Guam residents are U.S. citizens but cannot vote in U.S.
elections. It has an appointed governor and elected legislature.

   Savings and loan regulators are considering a
controversial program that would pump taxpayer dollars into ailing
thrift institutions before they fail.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. on Tuesday chose eight
states whose institutions would be eligible for open thrift
assistance, but postponed until next week approval of the program
itself.
   The states, picked because they are economically depressed, are:
Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana, New Mexico,
Oklahoma and Texas.
   Even if the FDIC adopts the program, the money for it would have
to come from the Resolution Trust Corp. Oversight Board, a Treasury
Department-led panel that controls the policy and pursestrings of
President Bush's S&amp;L bailout.
   The board has said in policy directives that it prefers bailout
money be spent on closing failed S&amp;Ls. Although it has not entirely
ruled out open thrift assistance, the board was reportedly unhappy
with the FDIC's draft proposal because in some cases the old
managers of the assisted thrift would have been allowed to keep
their jobs.
   Congress in last year's S&amp;L law specifically authorized
regulators to aid open thrifts in depressed states, but some
members of Congress argue that propping up the institutions wastes
money and does little more than postpone failure.
   Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., chairman of a House Banking Committee
task force on the S&amp;L bailout, and Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a
member of the banking committee, have written in opposition to the
plan.
   A similar program in the past ``actually increased the ultimate
cost of resolution and ... created unhealthy incentives in the
entire industry,'' they wrote.
   However, Seidman said regulators would consider the assistance
``only _ I repeat _ only when the cost of the assistance is clearly
less than the cost of closing the institution or any other
alternative available.''
   He said the FDIC would require that new capital be raised from
private sources, in addition to the federal money, and that
stockholders and creditors of an assisted institution be left no
better off than if the institution were shut down. The managers, if
they contributed to the institution's problems, would be thrown out.
   In the past, Seidman has argued that open thrift assistance is
sometimes cheaper because seizing and selling an S&amp;L so tarnishes
its reputation that new buyers demand more government aid than
would be required to revitalize the thrift under the old owners.
   In a separate development, the Treasury Department's Office of
Thrift Supervision demoted its top supervisory official,
transferring him to the agency's Indianapolis office. Darrel
Dochow, who had been the thrift office's director of supervision,
is swapping jobs with Indianapolis director John Downey.
   Dochow had been criticized by the House Banking Committee for
his part in handling the failure of Lincoln Savings and Loan
Association, Irvine, Calif.
   The top official of the thrift office, M. Danny Wall, left
earlier this month. He had been preceded by the agency's senior
attorney, Jordan Luke, who also was criticized in the Lincoln
matter.

   Namibia became the world's newest
nation Tuesday, ending 75 years of South African rule as Africa's
last colony with traditional tribal dances and choirs singing
liberation songs.
   The South African flag was lowered for the last time at midnight
local time and the new blue, red and green Namibian flag was raised
as thousands of blacks and whites cheered and clapped at
independence ceremonies.
   The huge, arid territory of 1.3 million people on Africa's
south-west coast was a German colony until it was captured by South
Africa during World War I.
   Representatives of dozens of nations attending the celebrations
were using the occasion for some behind-the-scenes consultations,
with the United States, the Soviet Union and others holding an
elaborate series of meetings.
   Among the foreign guests attending the celebrations are U.S.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze; Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak; the leaders
of at least 12 African nations; and the foreign ministers of
Britain, West Germany, Romania, Indonesia and other nations.
   South Africa agreed in December 1988 to grant independence to
Namibia under a regional peace treaty that also calls for Cuba to
withdraw its 50,000 soldiers from Angola by mid-1991.
   The independence date was chosen to mark the 30th anniversary of
the ``Sharpeville Massacre,'' when 69 unarmed demonstrators were
shot and killed in South Africa while protesting apartheid laws in
a black township south of Johannesburg.
   ``The day was chosen as a sign of solidarity not only for the
people of Namibia, but also with the people of South Africa,'' said
Hifikepunye Pohamba, who will become the home affairs minister in
the new government.
   Pohamba is a member of the South-West Africa People's
Organization, the group that waged a 23-year war against South
African rule and captured 57 percent of the vote in elections last
November.
   Namibia for decades has had the same apartheid laws of racial
segregtion as South Africa, although most were scrapped in recent
years.

   Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
presented Secretary of State James Baker with a nine-point peace
proposal on Tuesday, including a call for a cease-fire and direct
talks with U.S.-backed rebels, sources said.
   The meeting took place as Cuba warned it would retaliate against
the U.S.-armed rebels for an attack against a Cuban supply column
in Angola last week. The rebels say the Cuban troops were escorting
a resupply unit of the Angolan government.
   In its statement issued Tuesday, Cuba said one soldier was
killed and six wounded in the March 17 attack. ``This new
aggression against Cuban troops will not be left without
punishment,'' the statement said. U.S. officials say Cuba is
complying with an agreement to withdraw its troops from Angola by
next year.
   In Namibia, where the meeting took place on the sidelines of
independence celebrations for the former South African colony, a
U.S. official said Dos Santos appeared more flexible on the
cease-fire proposal than he had until now.
   Baker is expected to discuss the Angolan proposal with Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze at meetings in Windhoek
Tuesday and Wednesday. Shevardnadze, whose government provides
Angola with weapons to fight the U.S.-armed Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), also met Tuesday with Dos Santos in
Windhoek.
   The nine-point proposal has not been made public but was
obtained from sources on condition they not be identified. It
appears loosely based on a peace plan Dos Santos outlined earlier
this year.
   The plan appears to have some of the same problems that caused
UNITA to reject it in the past _ it fails to allow for
incorporation of the organization in Angola's political life.
Instead, the proposal envisages ``the right of citizens to
participate in political and social life.''
   It also calls for the ``recognition of the legitimacy of the
government and the state'' _ a proviso that UNITA also has rejected
as a pre-condition for talks. The rebels want the government to be
determined by elections in which UNITA can participate as a group.
   The change appears to stem from the plan's ninthpoint, which
calls for ``direct contacts with a view to achieving a cease-fire
and mechanisms of direct negotiations.''
   In Windhoek, a U.S. official said Dos Santos ``appeared more
inclined toward an early cease-fire than three months ago.''
   A cease-fire negotiated last June by Zaire's President Mobutu
Sese Seko broke down last summer and the Angolan government
attacked inside UNITA territory in February. The sides have been
locked in combat around the town of Mavinga in recent weeks.
   The Angolan plan also calls for:
   _ ``The neutrality and the positive attitude of third party
governments.'' This appears to be a reference to ending arms
supplies by the United States and Soviet Union;
   _ ``Special and adequate treatment of Jonas Savimbi's case.''
Savimbi has rejected past Angolan demands that he go into exile.

   This cat burglar has nine lives and

   It seems the Meier family pet, Punkin', tripped a burglar alarm
in his owners' home 14 times while the family was on a three-day
vacation.
   The Tippecanoe County Sheriff's Department is willing to forget
three of the trips made to the home to investigate, but it wants
the family to pay $925 in fines for the other 11.
   Besides setting off the security system, Punkin's home alone

   Ever had the urge to rip off those pesky tags on
pillows and mattresses? Well it's legal in Colorado.
   Gov. Roy Romer put to rest consumer fears by signing a law
Monday that deregulates the mattress and bedding industry, making
it legal to tear the tags off bedding items.
   He formalized the law by gleefully tearing a label off a pillow
at his state Capitol office.
   Ken Mesch, a legislative liaison for the Colorado Department of
Health, said the laws were enacted half a century ago to certify
that bedding materials were sterile.
   ``We have learned in the last 50 years a lot more about how
people get sick,'' Mesch said. ``And we know now that they don't
get sick from mattresses.''
   Rep. Jim Pierson, who introduced the bill told Romer that as a
child he was concerned, ``I might get in trouble by accidentally
tearing that label off.''
   ``I've been worrying about the mattress inspector jumping
through the window for years, and I hope this removes that,'' the
governor said.

<HEAD>Lithuania Forms Volunteer Border Force Despite Kremlin Warning</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>VILNIUS, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Lithuanian youths
volunteered Tuesday to serve as the breakaway republic's customs
and frontier guards despite a Kremlin warning not to change border
security operations.
   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis said the warning from
Moscow actually marked the beginning of negotiations on the Baltic
republic's demand for independence. He said Lithuania agreed with
much of the Kremlin statement, including the order to maintain
trade ties.
   Lithuania declared itself independent on March 11, 50 years
after it was occupied by the Red Army and annexed to the Soviet
Union. The Soviet Parliament declared the decree invalid but did
not say what steps it would take to stop the republic from seceding.
   In a stern warning to Lithuania on Monday, the Kremlin ordered
its own ministries to ensure there were no interruptions in customs
and frontier procedures and in trade, transport and communications.
   Lithuania Tuesday moved ahead with plans to take charge of its
borders, however, and youths volunteered to help.
   ``I served two years in the occupying army, and now I want to
serve in my own country's,'' said a young man as he rushed to turn
in his application in a cramped office in the Lithuanian capital's
center.
   Lithuanian officials said there were no plans to arm the border
force.
   The symbolic value of the force may help convince other
governments that Lithuania is controlling its territory and should
be formally recognized as a full-fledged country, said Edward
Tuskenis of the republic parliament's information center.
   The small Baltic republic was quiet Tuesday, with none of the
disturbing signs of Soviet troop movements that intimidated the
population over the weekend. Officials said there also were no
signs of an economic blockade by Moscow.
   ``We are still receiving gas and oil,'' Lithuania's two most
critical imports from the Soviet Union, said Prime Minister
Kazimera Prunskiene.
   Telephone communications between Lithuania and the West were
restored on Monday after being cut off for 2{ days due to what
Soviet officials said was maintenance work.
   However, Lithuanian Deputy Prime Minister Kazimieras Motieka
said Soviet military airfields in the republic ``have an excessive
number of helicopters and perhaps also military units.''
   Lithuania, on the Soviet Union's Western front line, contains
eight military bases and tens, if not hundreds of thousands of
troops, according to emigre sources.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has said he does not
intend to use force against the rebellious republic.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, speaking Tuesday in
Windhoek, Namibia, reiterated that position. ``We are against the
use of force in any region, and particularly against the use of
force domestically,'' he said.
   The White House voiced concern about Soviet troop movements on
Lithuania's borders, but spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Gorbachev
had offered assurances the Kremlin would not resort to force.
   A Lithuanian activist said people still were worried that an
attack might be staged on Soviet soldiers or their families to
create an excuse for a military takeover.
   ``We are concerned for the safety of Russian officers and their
families,'' said Virgilius Cepaitis, who served as a Lithuanian
representative in the Soviet Parliament until the declaration of
independence.
   He claimed that a provocateur attacked Soviet soldiers in
Azerbaijan in January, helping set off a military invasion of Baku
in which hundreds died as troops tried to end ethnic strife and
restore Soviet power.
   ``We have knowledge that similar troops are in Lithuania,'' he
said. ``But will they be used, or not?''
   Cepaitis said Lithuanians also feared an embargo and that
individual Soviets in positions of power would cut off supplies.
   With the Soviet economy already experiencing extreme shortages
of nearly everything, he said it would be very easy for a manager
who cannot fulfill all his orders to send his goods to the Ukraine
rather than Lithuania.
   Lithuanian officials said the border force was intended largely
to keep Soviet shoppers from stripping Lithuanian shelves bare in
case of shortages.
   Mrs. Prunskiene said the government hoped to have 37 border
posts within 10 days in spots where there are now traffic police on
the Soviet boundaries and KGB troops on the frontier with Poland.
   ``It will be a very gentle regime,'' said Mrs. Prunskiene.
``There will be no visas on the Soviet side or great demands. But
it will show there is a border already being observed and protected
by our country.''
   Many of the hundreds of youths who signed up serve on the force
are recent deserters from the Red Army, said Ludwiga Pociuniene,
who was taking the applications at the Lithuanian Parliament
building.
   Lithuanians have been complaining since the push for
independence began two years ago that their young men had been
harassed and tortured and faced death in the ranks of the army.
   Motieka said the Lithuanian government was registering the
deserters in hopes of protecting them from forcible return to their
units. However, he said military authorities had warned the
government that steps would be taken to arrest the soldiers and
return them to the army beginning on Saturday.
   In another development, Mrs. Prunskiene said she and Deputy
Prime Minister Algirdas Brazauskas met Tuesday with factory
directors to assure them that Lithuania wants business to proceed
as usual.
   The Kremlin order had warned Lithuania not to seize state
enterprises and sell them to private businesses, and Landsbergis
said the government had no intention of doing that.

   Labor Party leader Shimon Peres pledged to make
peace talks with Palestinians his first priority after President
Chaim Herzog chose him on Tuesday to take on the arduous task of
forming a new government.
   Peres said that if he succeeds, he will accept U.S. Secretary of
State James A. Baker III's proposal to open a Palestinian-Israeli
dialogue in Cairo.
   Peres' hard-line rival, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of the
Likud bloc, rejected Baker's plan.
   ``I think there is a majority in the Knesset (parliament) for
peace,'' Peres said. ``I will try to form a government as quickly
as possible.''
   The selection of Peres as prime minister-designate gave
center-left Labor a distinct advantage over Shamir, whose refusal
to accept the U.S. proposals led to the breakup of the Likud-Labor
coalition.
   Shamir, 74, remains head of a caretaker government until a new
governing coalition is assembled, He could get a crack at putting
together a government if Peres fails to complete the task within
the six-week limit.
   A statement from his office said Shamir respected the
president's decision but would not give up his campaign to set up a
Likud-led government.
   ``We will still make efforts to form a government under Likud
after Peres definitely fails to form his own government,'' Shamir
spokesman Yossi Ahimeir said.
   Peres, 66, conceded that he and Shamir each controlled 60 seats
in the 120-member parliament, but said he believed he could win
more support.
   ``There is no doubt that we need to make up with people. We need
to find common ground,'' Peres said.
   He left open the possibility of joining hands with almost any
parliament faction, even Likud.
   To do so, he must oversee a shotgun wedding of small leftist
factions and ultra-Orthodox religious groups. That could undercut
his ability to make the concessions needed to advance peace
negotiations.
   Herzog's position as head of state is largely ceremonial.
Israeli law left him with the task of breaking the tie between
Peres and Shamir.
   Herzog said in a televised address after picking Peres that
Labor was the largest faction and had the best chance after winning
a no-confidence vote against Shamir in parliament, 60-55, last
Thursday.
   Herzog said he saw no prospect for another Labor-Likud
government because neither party would accept the other's
leadership.
   ``Common sense obligates us to give a chance to a new direction,
one other that which fell to a no-confidence vote,'' he said.
   He called for electoral reform to create more stable government,
noting that the prime ministry changed five times, or once every 16
months, since he became president in 1983.
   Labor and Likud have shared power in a broad coalition since
1984, which was headed by Peres as prime minister for the first two
years.
   Peres needs the backing of 61 members of parliament to form a
new coalition.
   No candidate nominated by the president failed to assemble a
government, although Peres in 1984 and Shamir in 1988 had to share
the power.
   Peres had looked like a shoo-in to be tapped as
premier-designated, but a last-minute switch by a small religious
faction threw the nomination into doubt until the last moment.
   Israel television said Shamir had the edge because he was the
incumbent and the religious factions would fit more readily with
the conservative Likud.
   But Israeli newspapers said Peres remained Herzog's likely
choice because the party was technically the largest faction with
39 legislators to Likud's 35.

<TEXT>
   A plan to create an international lending
agency to aid the economic recovery of Eastern Europe may be
completed by July, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said
Tuesday.
   ``There is a sense of urgency among our European colleagues ...
to get this job done ... by the economic summit this summer,''
Brady told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee.
   The summit is scheduled for July 9-11 in Houston. The leaders of
the Group of Seven nations _ Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan,
the United States and West Germany _ will attend.
   On another topic, Brady told reporters that he will meet later
this week with Japanese Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto. Brady
said the meeting would be in California, but did not give a
specific date or location.
   Brady did not say what he and Hashimoto would discuss, but there
was speculation the agenda might include efforts to defuse the
growing trade friction between the United States and Japan.
   Brady told the subcommittee that the United States would
contribute between 8{ percent and 10 percent of the $10 billion
capital for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Redevelopment.
   The United States wants most of the funds aimed at
private-sector initiatives for the emerging democracies of Eastern
Europe, he said.
   Participation by the Soviet Union should be limited to the
amount of its contribution, Brady said. The Soviets tentatively are
scheduled to contribute 6 percent to the bank's capital.
   Brady has said the United States would refuse to participate
unless the Soviets are barred from borrowing any more money than
they contribute.
   ``We feel ... the purpose should to be assist and aid Eastern
Bloc countries,'' Brady said. ``We don't want to crowd out the
needs of those Eastern Bloc countries by having an enormous
participation by the Soviet Union.''
   Representatives of the 39 nations involved in creating the
agency plan to resume negotiations April 9 in Paris.
   One of the issues to be settled is the amount of capital the
United States will contribute, which will determine U.S. influence
on the bank's decisions.
   The Europeans will have 51 percent of the bank's votes, Brady
said.

<HEAD>McGruff, the Crime Dog, to Fight Drugs and Alcohol Among Children</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   What better way to get a message to a young
child than through coloring books and comics?
   That's the idea behind the National Crime Prevention Council's
new anti-drug publications featuring ``McGruff, the Crime Dog.''
   ``This prevention message is delivered each time a child picks
up one of the books to read or color,'' said John A. Calhoun, NCPC
executive director, as the coloring and comic books were presented
Tuesday at a news conference.
   ``The message is received not once but many times per child,''
Calhoun said.
   The coloring book, called ``Crack Down on Drugs,'' is aimed at
children who are in pre-school through third grades. In the book,
McGruff tells children to refuse to drugs and encourages their
efforts in sports, games, school and in helping friends.
   Children in third and fourth grades who face peers and slightly
older youths who encourage them to use alcohol and drugs are the
target of the comic book, called ``McGruff's Surprise Party.''
   Two million copies of each book have been produced to be
distributed free by the Office of Substance Abuse Prevention's
nationwide alcohol and drug awareness resource centers, and by 46
state crime prevention organizations. The agency is part of the
Department of Health and Human Services.
   The coloring book artwork was donated by the Noteworthy Corp.,
and the comic book was designed by Custom Comic Services.
   Single copies of the books can be requested from the National
Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information, P.O. Box 2345,
Rockville, Md. 20852. The phone number is 301-468-2600.

   Too much rain in parts of the South has
hampered farm work while other areas have benefited from widespread
precipitation, the government's Joint Agricultural Weather Facility
said Tuesday.
   ``Heavy rains added to the already surplus moisture supplies in
much of the Delta,'' the facility said in its report for March
12-18. ``Rain improved winter wheat prospects in most of the Great
Plains and portions of the Pacific Northwest.''
   The facility is operated by the Agriculture and Commerce
departments. The weekly reports cover crop conditions but do not
include production forecasts.
   Pastures were reported to be improving as a result of the
widespread moisture. Livestock was said to be in good condition
with spring lambing and calving continuing in most areas.

   U.S. District Judge Harold Greene denied John
Poindexter's motion for acquittal Tuesday after the prosecution
closed out its case against the man who was once President Reagan's
national security adviser.
   Poindexter's lawyers said they would begin playing seven hours
of videotaped testimony from Reagan on Wednesday in an effort to
bolster their client's defense. Poindexter is accused of
obstructing and lying to Congress to cover up the Iran-Contra
affair.
   Greene said evidence garnered from 10 witnesses called by the
prosecution in its 7{-day presentation against Poindexter suggests
he adopted false information ``designed to obstruct Congress.''
   Poindexter ``sent Oliver North to meet with'' the House
intelligence committee, where North lied by denying he was
assisting the Contras militarily, the judge said in rejecting the
motion for a acquittal.
   There is evidence that the ``defendant destroyed'' a
presidential finding as well as ``5,000 ... notes'' in his computer
on the Iran initiative, said Greene.
   In addition, the judge said, the jury has heard evidence that
``Oliver North got permission from Admiral Poindexter to check out
and cover up'' five memos showing North's military assistance to
the Contras.
   Poindexter attorney Richard Beckler told Greene there is no
evidence Congress had inquiries pending at the time Poindexter
supplied information on the Contras and a November 1985 shipment of
Hawk missiles.
   In urging acquittal, Beckler said Poindexter's destruction of a
presidential document on the Iran initiative is ``the epicenter''
of the government's case. Yet the destruction of the document is
never mentioned in the indictment, said Beckler.
   Greene replied that it isn't necessary for the document, a
presidential finding, to be mentioned in the indictment.
   Poindexter is accused of covering up the U.S. role in the 1985
missile shipment and North's secret Contra resupply operation. He
is charged with conspiracy, two counts of obstructing Congress and
two counts of making false statements.
   Iran-Contra prosecutor Dan Webb said there is ``overwhelming
evidence'' to proceed with the five criminal charges against
Poindexter.
   ``People like Admiral Poindexter who engage in conspiracies
ordinarily don't speak out, ... don't discuss what they are
doing,'' said Webb. He asserted that a trail of documents shows
that Poindexter conspired, obstructed Congress and made false
statements.
   The prosecution's final witness, Senate staff member Eric
Newsom, testified that ``it did seem strange'' how little
Poindexter said he knew about the missile shipment when questioned
a year afterward by members of Congress.
   The defense's first witness, former White House lawyer Dean
McGrath, said on cross-examination that he ``wouldn't have
cleared'' letters signed by Poindexter if he had known they were
false.
   The letters embraced statements made the previous year by Robert
McFarlane denying that North was raising money for or assisting the
Contras militarily.
   ``You would have ... stopped'' the letters ultimately signed by
Poindexter if they were false? asked prosecutor Louise Radin.
   ``I would have tried to,'' replied McGrath.
   The government's primary witness was North, who testified with
evident reluctance for 3{ days against his former boss.
   Last week, North testified that he had watched Poindexter
destroy the presidential finding which ratified the missile
shipment.
   In highlights of the government's case against Poindexter:
   _Poindexter told the FBI three days after resigning his White
House post as the Iran-Contra affair was becoming public in
November 1986 _ and after the meeting with senators that figured in
Tuesday's testimony _ that he had ``no working knowledge'' of early
Iran arms shipments and ``no direct knowledge'' that profits had
been diverted to the Contras, FBI agent Ellen Glasser testified.
   _Rep. Lee Hamilton testified Monday that Poindexter failed to
tell the House Intelligence Committee about the Reagan finding
relating to the missile shipment and then-CIA Director William
Casey told the committee the document didn't exist. Casey sent
Poindexter a copy of the finding a year before the CIA director
denied its existence, according to documents introduced at
Poindexter's trial.
   _North testified he was reluctant to go to an Aug. 6, 1986,
meeting to answer lawmakers' questions, but that Poindexter sent
him anyway, telling his aide that ``you can handle it'' or ``you
can take care of it.'' North lied at the meeting by denying he was
assisting the Contras militarily. North testified the decision to
lie was his own.

   President Bush called West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl on Tuesday to press the U.S. position that Poland's
current borders should be guaranteed when Germany reunifies, Bush's
spokesman said.
   The president telephoned Kohl on the eve of a visit to
Washington by Poland's Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who is
expected to raise the border issue with Bush.
   ``They did discuss the Polish borders question,'' Fitzwater said
of Bush's call to Kohl. ``President Bush reiterated our position
that we are strongly supportive of the Helsinki Final Act, which
calls for the inviolability of the Polish borders.''
   The Poles are still nervous about the issue even though Kohl,
under pressure from the United States and internally, finally
endorsed the idea of keeping the current borders.
   Bush called the German leader to talk about the move to reunify
East and West Germany and to discuss Sunday's election in East
Germany, said press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   The balloting was won by a coalition of conservative parties
allied with Kohl's ruling Christian Democrats in West Germany.
   The results are seen as a good sign for the future of Kohl's
party in a unified Germany.
   Kohl's government recently agreed that the Poles can be
represented in the unification talks among the two Germanys and the
World War II victors who divided Germany and ceded part of its
territory to Poland.
   Poland has been worried that the looming reunification could
mean a new unified Germany will demand its pre-war borders.
   Fitzwater said the administration is confident that Kohl's
position is in line with what Bush has said. Initially, Kohl
refused to endorse the current borders of Poland as permanent,
saying that question could only be answered by a unified Germany.
   Despite his new position, Fitzwater noted, ``The Polish still
have questions.'' He said Mazowiecki would raise the matter with
Bush during his state visit on Wednesday.
   When that happens, the spokesman said, ``We listen to his
concerns very closely and we look forward to talking with him, and
we'll just have to see what the discussion leads to.'
   A senior administration official who briefed White House
reporters on the Mazowiecki visit said Tuesday that administration
officials ``are delighted'' that West Germany is endorsing having
the Poles in on the unification talks regarding border issues.
   ``What has been done meets the concern'' of the United States,
said the official, who spoke on condition his name not be used.

<BYLINE>Broccoli-Hating Bush Encounters `The Broccoli Fellow'
^By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush may not like broccoli on his
plate, but he got a big kick Tuesday out of seeing a lobbyist
wearing a stalk of broccoli as a boutonniere.
   Bush broke into laughter when he spotted George S. Dunlop,
president of the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association,
wearing the leafy green vegetable dressed up like a carnation on
his lapel.
   It was a jocular protest against Bush's reported edict banning
broccoli from the menu aboard Air Force One, the presidential
aircraft.
   The encounter came as Bush was shaking hands with farm lawmakers
and lobbyists attending a ceremony at the White House where Bush
signed a proclamation designating Tuesday as National Agriculture
Day and urged Congress ``to help us pass a good, fair farm bill.''
   When he came to Dunlop, Bush did a double-take, laughed and
insisted his photographer get a picture of him with ``the broccoli
fellow.''
   Reporters at the ceremony could not hear the president's
exchange with Dunlop, but the lobbyist said afterward that Bush
told him, ``Hey, I like that! That's good!''
   He said Bush added that folks who ``like the taste of broccoli
really ought to eat it. It's good for them. Just because I don't
care to eat it, it doesn't mean that others shouldn't.''
   Bush's taste in food runs to pork rinds, taco salads with
hot-pepper sauce and chocolate bars mixed with oat bran.
   Dunlop, a former Senate Agriculture Committee chief of staff who
now represents the $60 billion produce industry, said he had a
florist at a local supermarket make up the boutonniere.
   Broccoli is a $400 million crop for American farmers in
California, the Carolinas and other vegetable-growing states, said
Dunlop.
   But the produce pusher said he harbors no ill feelings at the
president's disdain for the vegetable.
   ``It's a free country,'' the lobbyist said. ``There's plenty of
things the president does like. If he doesn't care for broccoli,
maybe he likes carrots or apples or potatoes.''
   And what did Dunlop plan to do with his boutonniere?
   ``Well, I think I'll go home and eat it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Independence Movement Wins in Estonia Parliament</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Independence supporters won Estonia's
parliamentary elections, giving secessionist movements a sweep of
the three Baltic republics, according to preliminary results
released Tuesday.
   In Moscow, activists of the Democratic Russia bloc that took
control of the city council in Sunday's runoffs debated what to do
with their power, but they appeared divided and lacked a platform.
   Estonia's initial results indicated candidates from the People's
Front won at least 38 of the 105 seats in the republic's new
parliament, said Rina Lohmus, a correspondent for official Estonian
Radio. At least 16 seats were taken by the Estonian Committee, a
more radical independence group.
   A group of small parties supporting the People's Front platform
also won several seats, according to the radio. Results from about
15 seats still had not been determined, Lohmus said.
   The secessionists' win followed the electoral victories of
independence movements in the neighboring Baltic republics of
Latvia and Lithuania.
   In Lithuania, pro-independence lawmakers declared their
republic's independence from the Soviet Union about two weeks after
Feb. 24 balloting, widening their split with Moscow.
   Latvia's elections were Sunday, and the pro-independence
movement won a majority. However, it remained unclear whether it
could muster the two-thirds vote needed to declare independence.
   ``More people supported the People's Front than we expected,''
said Lempi Tekone, a spokeswoman for the Estonian group.
   She said the People's Front anticipated having the support of
about three-quarters of the deputies. Official results were not
expected until Friday.
   Yedinstvo, a group representing primarily Russian-speaking
residents who strongly oppose the Baltic independence drive, would
have about 25 percent of the seats, she said.
   Ms. Lohmus said Free Estonia, an election group created by the
republic's Communist Party, had won about 10 seats. Among those who
won seats from Free Estonia were the party leader Vaino Vyalyas and
Premier Indrik Toome, she said.
   The Estonian Communist Party has not worked as hard for
independence as many Estonian activists would like, but it is
expected to support independence in any important legislative votes.
   However, Estonia is unlikely to follow Lithuania in pushing hard
and fast for independence. Activists say the parliament is likely
to discuss sharing power with the Estonian Congress, a citizens'
gathering demanding independence, and press for talks with the
Kremlin.
   Reformers also claimed victories in key runoff elections held
Sunday in Russia, Byelorussia and the Ukraine, the Slavic heartland
that accounts for about 80 percent of Soviet territory and
two-thirds of its population.
   Some 1,610 runoffs were held in these republics after no
candidate polled 50 percent of the vote March 4 in the main round
of elections for local parliaments and councils.
   The Moscow electoral commission said 55 of the capital's 65
seats in Russia's parliament were dominated by candidates of the
reformist Democratic Russia alliance.
   Democratic Russia won 263 seats in the 465-seat Moscow city
council, ensuring itself a 60 percent majority. But it was unclear
whether members of the alliance would be able to agree on a joint
program.
   ``We came to the bloc from various groups because we all shared
some democratic views,'' a councilman who gave his name as Fadeyev
told a meeting of Democratic Russia activists at Moscow State
University. ``But now this stage is over. We see that there are
Communists, Socialists, Social Democrats and even Christian
Socialists among us.''
   ``We must be united. The only hope of the old party apparatus is
to cause a split among us,'' said Sergei Sukhorukov, another
councilman.
   Russian Parliament member Gavriil Popov, who presided over the
tense gathering of about 150 activists, suggested the alliance
appoint committees to work out the group's platform and proposals
for reforms.
   The only immediate measures were a request to Moscow's
prosecutor to investigate anti-Semitic leaflets that appeared
during the elections and called Democratic Russia a ``United Jewish
Front,'' and a demand that local newspapers include party
affiliation when naming election winners.
   In Leningrad, reformists of a group called the Democratic
Elections-90 bloc won 60 percent to 70 percent of the city council
seats, the official Tass news agency said.

   An anti-abortion conservative challenged the
Republican front-runner in the gubernatorial primary Tuesday, and
Rep. Gus Savage fought to keep his job after allegations of sexual
misconduct.
   Attorney Richard Phelan, whose ethics investigation led to the
resignation of U.S. House Speaker Jim Wright, battled three
opponents for the Democratic nomination for the powerful Cook
County Board presidency.
   Chicago Alderman Edwin W. Eisendrath, 32, sought to deny
80-year-old Rep. Sidney Yates the Democratic nomination for a 21st
term from the 9th Congressional District. Also in the race was
James Newport-Chiakulas, 49, a National Education Association
official.
   Late polls gave a wide lead to Secretary of State Jim Edgar, a
pro-choice moderate, in the GOP primary race to replace retiring
four-term Republican Gov. James R. Thompson.
   Steven Baer, abortion opponent and political newcomer, was
Edgar's closest challenger. A third candidate, Dr. Robert Marshall,
ran a low-profile campaign.
   The winner squares off in November against state Attorney
General Neil Hartigan, who faced no opposition in the Democratic
primary.
   In the 2nd Congressional District, representing parts of
Chicago's heavily Democratic South Side and some suburbs, Savage
faced his toughest primary since first winning election in 1980.
Challenger Mel Reynolds said Savage embarrassed constituents when
he was investigated for harassing a Peace Corps worker in Africa.
   Also in the Democratic primary was Ernest Washington Jr., a
follower of extremist Lyndon LaRouche.
   Phelan spent thousands of his own dollars to finance a media
blitz, but late polls showed him running only slightly ahead of R.
Eugene Pincham, a black former state appellate judge. The two other
contenders were County Clerk Stanley Kusper and state Sen. Ted
Lechowicz, the Democrats' slated candidate.
   The State Board of Elections said just over 6 million Illinois
residents were registered to vote. By late afternoon, turnout was
running at about 43 percent in Chicago and 25 percent in suburban
Cook County.
   Also Tuesday, New York City voters filled two vacant
congressional seats in special elections. Republican City
Councilwoman Susan Molinari was favored to win the seat given up by
her father, Guy Molinari, who has become Staten Island borough
president. And in the Bronx, state Assemblyman Jose Serrano was the
front-runner to win the job vacated by Robert Garcia after his
conviction in the Wedtech influence peddling scandal.

   Edgar, 43, was state GOP leaders' choice as the best hope of
retaining the Executive Mansion occupied 14 years by Thompson, who
plans to join a Chicago law firm. Edgar picked up President Bush's
backing on Monday.
   Baer, 30, flayed Edgar for his support of abortion rights and
extension of last year's temporary 20 percent state income-tax
increase. Baer had support from conservative activist Phyllis
Schlafly, but Edgar, despite his pro-choice position, won the
endorsement of a leading anti-abortion congressman, Rep. Henry Hyde.
   Savage, a 64-year-old black Congressman whose district is 70
percent black, invoked race to rally his troops, saying he was the
victim of ``white-owned media.''
   The U.S. House ethics committee this year ruled Savage made
improper sexual advances to the woman during a 1989 trip to Zaire.
No charges were pressed.
   Reynolds, a 38-year-old black Rhodes scholar making his second
bid for the seat, was endorsed by Chicago's two largest daily
newspapers.
   The top job in Cook County _ which includes Chicago _ came up
for grabs when George W. Dunne, 76, announced he was retiring after
21 years.
   Phelan, 52, was staff attorney for the House ethics committee's
investigation of Wright. The candidate has long been active in
Democratic politics, but the contest for the patronage-rich post
marks his first candidacy.
   Pincham, 64 _ an ally of the late Harold Washington, Chicago's
first black mayor _ made headlines in 1987 when he said blacks who
didn't vote for his friend ``ought to be hung.''
   Kusper, 55, stressed his experience, but was dogged by reports
he put county money in no-interest accounts in politically
connected banks.
   Lechowicz, 51, was little known outside his Northwest Side
district despite 20 years in the General Assembly.
   The uncontested GOP nominee for the board president's job was
state Sen. Aldo A. DeAngelis.
   Voters in the 9th District, covering Chicago's North Side and
suburbs, have given Yates high seniority in the House, where he
serves on the Appropriations Committee.
   Eisendrath, a former teacher, stressed the need for new blood.
   Democratic U.S. Sen. Paul Simon was unopposed in the primary, as
was the Republican he will face in November, Rep. Lynn Martin.

   Ted Landsmark can't forget the bloody anti-busing
riots of the 1970s any more than people can forget the Pulitzer
Prize-winning photograph taken of him under attack outside City
Hall by angry whites wielding an American flag.
   But after previewing a television re-creation of the nightmare,
the young, black attorney and others are asking: How well have we
remembered?
   A brief silence spread over the audience after a private
screening Monday of ``Common Ground,'' based on the best-selling
book by Anthony Lukas. The docudrama will be broadcast Sunday and
Tuesday on CBS-TV.
   The group of about 60 people sat quietly, perhaps fatigued by
the 192-minute Hollywood re-creation of the racial drama that tore
this city apart 15 years ago.
   Then the talk started. The voices _ many still bitter _ belonged
to the people who inhabit ``Common Ground,'' the story of three
families caught up in the riots that broke out when black students
were bused into the white neighborhood of Charlestown.
   ``I don't think anyone views this as pure entertainment ... but
it could be an opportunity for the commmunity to disuss what
remains to be done,'' said Landsmark, who now directs the mayor's
Office of Jobs and Community Services.
   Not everyone who attended the showing was of that mind.
   ``This is nothing but pornography!'' said Elveira ``Pixie''
Palladino, an anti-busing activist.
   It could have been any Boston high school auditorium more than a
decade ago. But it was not, and that's what some found troubling.
   ``It's a shame that some people can't live with the pain and the
same of the past,'' said George Walker, whose half-sister,
Cassandra Twymon, was bused to Charlestown and whose family is
featured in Lukas' Pulitzer Prize-winning book.
   ``Cassandra and I were just kids ... guinea pigs,'' said Lisa
McGoff, whose Charlestown family's story was also chronicled. ``I'm
not going to apologize to anyone for what this book is about.''
   The book is about Alice McGoff and her stand against the forced
desegration she felt threatened her children and mostly Irish
community. It's also about Rachel Twymon and her belief that
education could secure for her children a life better than that
they'd known in the city's Roxbury section.
   Those two strongly held beliefs came at an enormous cost to the
families and to the city. The public school system has never
recovered and the racial battle lines, though at times less stark,
remain intact.
   ``I don't think it's any stigma to Boston ... but even the mayor
didn't come out as well as he'd like to and maybe the city didn't
either,'' said Kevin White, who was mayor during the riots.
``Funny, none us were ever the same after the war was over.''
   It was a war and, like any historic passage, should be examined
with the distance only time provides, the producers said.
   ``Obviously there's a feeling among some of these people that
they don't want this picture shown,'' said Daniel H. Blatt, who
produced the miniseries for Lorimar Telepictures Co. ``But what
occurred has to be faced.''
   The producers and families featured in the film, all of whom had
veto rights on the script, testified to its accuracy. Lukas said he
only regretted that his 661-page book had been condensed to a
four-hour script that largely overlooks his third family, the
Divers, who tried to promote social justice amid a city in tumult.
   Mayor Raymond Flynn, who was an anti-busing activist in the
1970s, did not attend the private showing or return repeated
telephone calls to discuss it. The producers said he refused to let
the production company film the more incendiary scenes on location.
   ``He felt that shooting here would incite violence,'' said
Blatt. ``I can't put myself into his shoes, but this problem of
race and class and education is with us today. It's a reality.''

   Raytheon Co. pleaded guilty Tuesday to
illegally obtaining secret Air Force budget documents and agreed to
pay $1 million in fines and penalties.
   The plea in U.S. District Court made Raytheon, of Lexington,
Mass., the fifth defense contractor to plead guilty to trafficking
in classified Pentagon documents.
   Raytheon's guilty plea involves the actions of a former
employee, John R. Kiely, who obtained a classified 1983 Air Force
document.
   However, U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson said in a statement that
Raytheon illegally obtained a wide range of Pentagon papers from
1978 to 1985.
   Under a plea bargain approved by the court, Raytheon will pay a
$10,000 criminal fine and $990,000 in civil penalties and damages.
   The government said it has no evidence that anyone now
associated with Raytheon was involved in the scheme or knew about
it.
   Since November, four other contractors have entered guilty pleas
and three other individuals have been convicted in the
investigation code-named ``Operation Uncover,'' an investigation
still under way. The key documents involved generally were Defense
Department five-year spending plans.
   The others convicted were:
   _Boeing Co. Boeing paid fines and penalties of $5.2 million
following its Nov. 13 guilty plea. Former Boeing employee Richard
Lee Fowler was convicted Dec. 7 of 39 counts of conspiracy,
conveyance without authority, mail fraud and conversion of
government property. He received a two-year prison sentence.
   _RCA Corp., a subsidiary of General Electric Co. RCA pleaded
guilty Feb. 5 and paid fines and restitution totaling $2.5 million.
A current RCA executive, Ronald Stevens, and a former executive,
Leonard Kampf, are awaiting sentencing on their guilty pleas to
conveyance without authority. They each face possible sentence of
10 years in prison.
   _Hughes Aircraft Co., a subsidiary of General Motors Corp.
Hughes entered a guilty plea March 9 and was ordered to pay $3.57
million in fines and penalties.
   _Grumman Corp. Grumman pleaded guilty last Friday and was
ordered to pay $2.5 million in fines and penalties.

   Vice President-elect Virgilio Godoy
said Tuesday that the Sandinista Front was engineering a campaign
to discredit him by having him accused of fraud. The case could
prevent his taking office next month.
   The allegations involve research foundation funds.
   Judge Ramon Rojas Mendez of 4th District Criminal Court rejected
the charge on a technicality Tuesday, but the charge could be filed
again.
   The judge said the accusers failed to inform police, as required
before accusations can be presented in court.
   Godoy hinted that forces in his own United National Opposition
coaliation were involved in what he called a ``campaign of
calumny,'' in an internal power struggle to weaken his position
when the government takes office April 25.
   He said he believes his life might be in danger if he is cleared
in court.
   ``This shows the the Sandinista Front's interest in saying
goodbye by kicking Virgilio Godoy ... (and also) the involvement of
people from the private sector in this matter,'' Godoy said.
   He said later, when asked to expand on the private sector
remark, ``It's an attempt on their part to weaken the figure of the
vice president in order to obtain positions of power'' within the
new government.
   He named no names.
   President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro and Godoy were the
winning ticket of UNO, a coalition of 14 parties and one native
Indian organization.
   The UNO swept general elections on Feb. 25, unseating the
Sandinistas after 10{ years in power.
   Four men filed a document in court Monday accusing Godoy of
fraud. Two of them, Joaquin Mejia and Juan Manuel Gutierrez, belong
to the Liberal Independent Party. Godoy is president of the party.
   The four allege Godoy failed to account for funds donated to a
research center by the West German Friedrich-Naumann Foundation.
   In rejecting the charge, Godoy cites a letter from the
foundation that brands the accusations as false.
   ``This is a new campaign to slander me,'' Godoy said in an
interview on Radio Catolica.
   In expressing fear for his life, the vice president-elect said,
``While I'm under attack ... the danger of a physical aggression is
still on the sidelines. (But) when this media terrorism ends, I'll
have to take better care of myself because then I'll be closer to
an attempt at personal aggression, including physical elimination.''
   Should Godoy be arrested and tried, he could not take office
until the judicial matter is settled. If convicted and imprisoned,
he also could not take office.
   Last November, Godoy was stripped of his legislative immunity as
a deputy of the Sandinista-dominated National Assembly as a result
of the same accusations. That action opened the way for legal
charges to be filed.

<TEXT>
   The incoming president of Costa Rica, Rafael
Angel Calderon, met with President Bush on Tuesday to discuss peace
developments in Nicaragua and U.S. aid to Costa Rica.
   Calderon expressed interest in following the lead of outgoing
President Oscar Arias to continue Costa Rica's involvement in
working for peace and political stability in Central America, said
one U.S. official.
   Arias won a Nobel peace prize for his work in spearheading the
regional peace accord that led to last month's election in
Nicaragua and the end to the Contra war.
   Arias and other Latin American leaders are engaged in talks on
how to demobilize the U.S.-backed Contra rebels and arrange a
peaceful transfer of power when Nicaragua's Marxist President
Daniel Ortega leaves office April 25.
   Costa Rica also is seeking greater U.S. economic assistance,
said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   The new Costa Rican president is a conservative and a supporter
of strong U.S.-Costa Rica ties.
   Calderon also met with Vice President Dan Quayle. Talks were
also scheduled with Cabinet members and members of Congress.
   Calderon takes office May 8 for a four-year term.

<HEAD>Maryland Banker Revises Lawsuit Against CIA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former official of a Baltimore bank said
Tuesday he has filed a revised lawsuit which seeks $4 million from
the bank, the CIA and other federal officials for allegedly ruining
his life after he balked at handling arms transactions for a CIA
front.
   Robert Maxwell charges that he was threatened, was forced to
resign and suffered a nervous breakdown after he questioned the
legality of certain dealings relating to an account held by the
now-defunct Associated Traders Corp. at the First National Bank of
Maryland, in Baltimore.
   Maxwell left the bank in late 1985, taking with him several
documents which, he told a news conference Tuesday, linked
Associated Traders with at least $23 million in covert arms
shipments to Central America, Angola and Afghanistan.
   Published accounts by columnist Jack Anderson and others, dating
to 1986, have identified Associated Traders, dissolved in the wake
of that publicity, as a CIA front. According to Maxwell's suit,
bank officials confirmed to him that it was.
   More than a year ago, Maxwell brought a $19 million damage suit
against the bank in state court. The bank's attorneys, who
succeeded in moving the case to federal court, filed legal briefs
saying ``a relationship between First National and the CIA or
Associated Traders and the CIA could be classified information
which can neither be confirmed nor denied.'' Bank counsel Gary
Sutton has declined further public comment on the case, as has the
CIA.
   Maxwell's revision names the CIA and 10 ``John Does'' in other
federal agencies as defendants. According to the new suit, another
bank counsel, Joseph G. Finnerty, transmitted threats to Maxwell's
attorney, Thomas J. Dolina, in behalf of unnamed government
officials that if he didn't ``go easy'' on the suit, Dolina would
be disbarred and Maxwell would be criminally prosecuted.
   Calls to Finnerty's office and home were not immediately
answered.
   Maxwell talked to reporters Thursday at the offices of the
Association of National Security Alumni. The group opposes
clandestine operations and is backing Maxwell's legal effort.

<HEAD>Service Personnel Chiefs Disagree on Test of Women in Combat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army's top personnel officer said Tuesday
he opposes a proposed four-year test of whether women can hold
combat-related jobs. His Air Force counterpart disagreed, saying
there probably isn't a war-time job in his service that women
couldn't do.
   The test has been proposed in legislation put forward by Rep.
Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo.
   ``I don't feel that a test is necessary,'' Army Lt. Gen. Allen
K. Ono testified before the House Armed Services subcommittee on
military personnel.
   ``The fundamental issue ... is (one of) national policy. There's
no ducking that _ whether women should serve in direct combat, and
that's for you to decide,'' Ono told the lawmakers in the first
subcommittee hearing on women in the military.
   Ono argued that other nations, such as Canada, have wrestled
with the issue of using women in combat-related jobs and that the
United States can learn from their experiences. Although Canada
recently offered infantry training to 80 women, only one became
qualified, the panel was told.
   The general said that it would also be difficult to conduct such
a test in peace time and that there is no military need to bring
women into combat fields.
   ``The Army can't operate without its women soldiers _ but in
regards to combat arms, we are able to recruit sufficient numbers
of males,'' Ono said.
   However, Lt. Gen. Thomas A. Hickey, the Air Force's personnel
chief, told the lawmakers that ``there probably isn't a combat job
in the Air Force that women couldn't do.
   ``They're physically capable; they're emotionally capable. If
you want us to put them there, it's up to you,'' Hickey said.
   By U.S. law, women in the Navy and Air Force are barred from
serving in combat jobs. The Army is not covered under the same
statute and has written its own policy to comply with the law.
   Ms. Schroeder submitted her legislation following the U.S.
invasion of Panama in light of the fact that some of the 600 women
who took part in the initial operation came under fire even though
they were not detailed to units considered combat-related.
   Ms. Schroeder, who testified about her bill before the panel,
argued that excluding women from combat-related jobs doesn't
protect them from coming under fire on the battlefield and actually
``shuts off many routes of advancement'' for women who want to make
the military a career.
   The congresswoman pointed out that one Army advertisement
highlights a female soldier working in a communications van,
directing other soldiers in the front lines of battle.
   Mrs. Schroeder said that even though women are allowed to enter
communications jobs, they could be posted to one of the first sites
targeted by an enemy eager to cut off an opponent's communications.
   ``It appears that women can be the first killed, but they're not
allowed to be in the front lines,'' Ms. Schroeder said. ``I think
that really shows you how tenuous many of these classifications
really are.''
   The congresswoman has proposed legislation directing the Army to
conduct a four-year test of women to see how they would perform in
the combat-related units.
   Rep. Beverly Byron, D-Md., the chairman of the subcommittee,
said she is not in favor of opening combat jobs to women, but is
interested in making sure that women in the military have promotion
opportunities in their selected fields.
   ``I've got some misgivings about any change in the combat
exclusion law,'' Mrs. Byron said. File Stored As:

   A consumer group complained Tuesday that
supermarket displays putting sugar-laden cereals at kids-eye level
are attracting children with ``candy ads masquerading as cereal.''
   Such displays add to the problems of getting children to eat
more nutritious foods, said the Center for Science in the Public
Interest.
   Victoria Leonard said the center surveyed supermarket cereal
displays and found child-oriented cereals in colorful packages
generally lower than the more nutritious cereals marketed for
adults.
   ``That makes it more likely to catch the attention of a child
walking by,'' said Leonard. ``Children are being bombarded by candy
ads that are masquerading as cereal.''
   CSPI volunteers last November looked at the location of cereals
displayed in 27 grocery stores in the Boston, San Francisco,
Chicago, Baltimore and Washington, D.C. metropolitan areas.
   ``The average position of ten child-oriented brands was the
next-to-bottom shelf, while the average position of ten adult
brands was the next-to-top shelf of a typical four-shelf-display,''
the center said.
   All 27 stores displayed adult cereals such as Grape Nuts or
Nutri-Grain which have an average of 10 percent sugar content on
higher shelves than child-oriented products such as Froot Loops or
Cap'n Crunch which contain an average 44 percent sugar content, the
center said.
   Surveyors shopped at stores of several supermarket chains,
including Giant Food Inc., Safeway and Lucky Stores, Inc.
   Officials of Lucky's had not received a copy of the survey but
spokeswoman Judy Decker said the company has ``never had an
objective to place cereals on shelves to attract children's
attention.''
   Decker said cereals are grouped according to manufacturer and
how quickly they sell in the stores.
   ``The lower shelves usually have the fastest moving items,'' she
said, explaining that the lower shelves are spaced farther apart
and allow stock personnel to stack more cereal than in the middle
and upper shelves.
   Officials of other stores and food marketing industry
representatives did not immediately return phone calls.
   Leonard said the center has written the stores asking that they
change the displays and elevate the children's cereals.
   ``Children are attracted by the brand names and flashy packaging
and then plead with their parents to buy them,'' she said. ``We
want parents to make the choice.''
   She said display techniques and intense television advertising
of sugary cereals during Saturday morning children's programming
compound problems of parents.
   CSPI is a nonprofit, 200,000-member organization founded in 1971
to promote improved health policy.

   Pieces of a spy satellite put into orbit over
the Soviet Union by the space shuttle last month are falling back
to Earth and burning up as they pass through the atmosphere, the
Defense Department indicated Tuesday.
   ``Two of the items have already entered the Earth's
atmosphere,'' said spokesman Pete Williams. ``The remainder are
expected to decay within two to seven weeks.''
   Williams did not identify the items as a satellite but said they
were ``associated with'' last month's secret mission of the space
shuttle Atlantis. NASA sources have said astronauts aboard Atlantis
put a sophisticated $500 million spy satellite into an orbit that
carried it over much of the Soviet Union.
   The Defense Department said one piece burned up on reentry on
March 15, but it did not say where. A second piece made its fiery
dive over the Gulf of Alaska on March 19.
   There were reports from the Soviets last week that the satellite
had broken into four big pieces, which were being tracked by radar.
   The Defense Department acknowledged then that some debris from
the shuttle mission would be coming back to Earth. U.S. officials
would not confirm the specifics of the Soviet reports, saying
merely that the Atlantis mission ``has achieved its goal.''
   ``On the average one to two items in space from the hundreds of
space launches each year reenter the atmosphere each day,''
Williams said Tuesday. He refused to answer more questions.

   China's request for a $150 million loan for
road improvements won't be presented to representatives of the
World Bank, a bank spokesman said Tuesday.
   Peter Riddleberger declined to say why bank President Barber B.
Conable decided to hold back the loan.
   A source familiar with the bank's work said Conable decided
Monday to withhold consideration of the loan when it became
apparent it would not be approved.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said last week that the
United States would oppose World Bank loans that were not for basic
human needs.
   The $150 million loan would have been used to improve roads and
inland ways in Jiangsu province, in the east central part of China.
   Decisions on loans are made behind closed doors by the 22
members of the bank's Board of Executive Directors, most of whom
represent several countries.
   The United States controls only 19 percent of the vote, but that
is the largest single block. Usually enough other governments
support the U.S. view to give it the needed majority.
   In June, Conable withheld consideration of nearly $800 million
worth of loans to China after troops suppressed the pro-democracy
movement. He said that decision was made on economic grounds.
   President Bush asked that loans be held up as part of the U.S.
sanctions against the Chinese government.
   The board last month approved two loans to China worth $90
million, including one that had been delayed in June. The U.S.
representative voted for approval, the Treasury Department said.
   The World Bank, with 152 member governments, is the largest
single source of aid to the Third World, making loans of more than
$22 billion a year.

   Leaders of the National Liberation Army
derided another leftist rebel group for surrendering to the
government and pledged to keep up a sabotage campaign against the
oil industry and U.S. businesses.
   At a meeting deep in the Andes mountains last Saturday with
eight reporters, ELN commanders chided the April 19 Movement, known
as the M-19, for laying down its arms and transforming itself into
a political party this month. The M-19 won seats on city councils
and one mayor's office in nationwide municipal elections on March
11. Its participation was considered a victory for President
Virgilio Barco's peace plan. Barco has repeatedly exhorted other
rebel groups to accept the plan.
   ``We were always uncertain about the M-19's ideological
position,'' said one ELN commander, identifying himself only as
James. ``Now it seems our doubts were justified.''
   ELN, Colombia's most active leftist guerrilla organization, says
it will never negotiate with the government and holds fast to a
Marxist-Leninist plan to take and hold power.
   Its members denigrated the M-19.
   ``They fought for 16 years to win a mayor's office,'' said
Ernesto, an ELN operative in Bogota. ``We control large sections of
the countryside. Who is more intellegent?''
   The ELN has long wreaked havoc in the rural areas through
ambushes of security forces and sabotage campaigns.
   Now it appears to be launching a news media offensive.
   ``We are planning to increase our contacts with the press in
order to clarify our positions and correct the lies of the
government,'' said commander Argemiro.
   The reporters, contacted by ELN operatives at cafes and other
public places in Bogota, were taken by different routes to a
drop-off point, where rebels led them into the hills.
   To reach the camp, an Associated Press reporter, accompanied by
two rebels, hiked nine hours in the dark across terrain ranging
from dense jungle to rocky mountains.
   At the camp, on cleared land tilting down into thick mountain
vegetation, 12 ELN soldiers shouted slogans as they raised Uzi
submachine guns and assault rifles toward a television camara.
   They later performed training exercises for the camera's benefit
before posing arm-in-arm with the television crew.
   After feeding the exhausted journalists soup made of animal
intestines and dirty water, ELN commanders gathered them around a
rickety table.
   They demanded a national commission be formed to accept the
release of 14 soldiers kidnapped by the ELN in February.
   The commanders said freeing the soldiers would prove ELN's
commitment to humane treatment of prisoners of war, and challenged
the government to follow suit.
   They accused the military of murdering rebels captured in
combat, a charge the government denies.
   They invited reporters to return to the mountains to witness the
soldiers' releases at the end of this month.
   Although the ELN is still learning how to deal with the news
media, it is highly skilled when it comes to attacking government
security forces, kidnapping opponents, and sabotaging Colombia's
oil industry.
   For years local radio has peppered Colombians with news of ELN
attacks on army and police patrols.
   The group's armed forces are estimated at 1,000 to 2,000 rebels.
ELN is said to finance part of its activities by ransoms paid by
hundreds of cattle ranchers it kidnaps every year.
   The commanders would not discuss the ELN's strength or its
financing.
   They had a simple message regarding petroleum facilities: they
plan to keep attacking them until the government nationalizes the
industry.
   The ELN has pulled off eight dynamite attacks this year against
Colombia's main oil pipeline running 500 miles from the border with
Venezuela to the Caribbean port of Covenas.
   The commanders bristled when asked about the government's view
of them as terrorists costing the nation millions of dollars in
foreign exchange each year.
   ``We are patriots who are saving the country money by preventing
the export of petroleum that belongs to our people,'' said a
commander called Dario. ``The crumbs given to the government by the
foreign oil companies are just a fraction of the money the country
could earn if the industry were nationalized.''
   A month ago the ELN swore to attack U.S. business interests here
as part of a ``sovereignty campaign'' to defend national interests.
   The ELN was founded in 1965 and took its inspiration from the
Cuban revolution.
   Now it says it is tired of being linked to Fidel Castro.

<TEXT>
   A closed session of parliament Tuesday
charged 20 prominent Jordanians, including seven former Cabinet
members, with financial and administrative corruption, lawmakers
said.
   One lawmaker, speaking on condition of anonymity, said those
accused included four members of the parliament, which was elected
in November.
   The names were made available to The Associated Press and were
confirmed by four deputies who attended Tuesday's session.
   They cannot be disclosed under a law that prohibits open
allegations against private and public figures unless they are
convicted by Jordanian courts.
   State television said the parliament turned the case _ said to
involve 37 projects including construction of a desert highway and
expired food projects _ over to the attorney general to pursue
``those who were responsible for mismanagement.''
   The parliament has the power to charge officials with crimes.
   If convicted, the accused will face prison sentences and fines,
and the government will permanently confiscate their property and
cash.
   Seven of the former Cabinet members are members of parliament,
the sources said. They confirmed an eighth person accused is a
well-placed politician.
   Also accused were a former senior security official, two former
senior Central Bank officials, three prominent merchants, a leading
banker and five senior government department officials, among whom
one is member of parliament.
   The deputy who discussed the case said the 37 projects were
recently investigated by the parliament and ruled as ``tampering
with public funds.''
   He said a previous government spent $935 million on the
construction of a desert highway, while the actual cost of the bid
was $51 million.
   Another case involved selling expired food products. ``The lab
tests proved that these expired products caused cancer if consumed,
such as red meat, canned food and coffee, which were sold to
Jordanian citizens for many years,'' the deputy said.
   The government of Prime Minister Mudar Badran backed the
parliament's decision to bring charges, and the motion was adopted
by a vote of 76-0 with four abstentions, one deputy said.
   The deputy said the abstentions in the 80-member chamber were
the four deputies who were accused.
   Badran has promised to heed parliament's demands to fight the
alleged corruption of the government of his predecessor, Zeid Rifai.
   Four days of rioting erupted in the kindom last April after
Rifai's government raised the prices of basic food commodities and
fuel. This led to the downfall of Rifai's government, which then
was accused of corruption and restriction of political freedoms.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
met Tuesday with Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos to find
ways to end the African nation's 15-year-old civil war, and a U.S.
official said dos Santos appeared more flexible on a proposed
cease-fire.
   The administration official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said it was the first meeting between a U.S. secretary
of state and an Angolan president since independence from Portugal
in 1975.
   ``President dos Santos appeared more inclined toward an early
cease-fire than he was three months ago,'' the U.S. official said.
   Baker also met with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
and said he was assured the Soviet Union would not use force to
crush Lithuania's independence movement.
   ``The minister made it very clear to me that they are hopeful
questions involving Lithuania will be handled through dialogue.
That's what the central government would like to have happen and
that's what they expect to have happen,'' said Baker, visiting
Namibia to attend the celebration of independence from South Africa.
   ``And he, once again, as he has done before ... said that force
would not be the solution to the problem as far as the Soviet Union
is concerned,'' Baker said.
   Baker said the talks ``covered a wide range of issues starting
with the fact that what is happening here in Namibia we both agree
is a good example when the Soviet Union and the United States
cooperate rather than compete.''
   Shevardnadze said, ``I believe Namibia is the best example that
this is realistic.''
   The United States brokered an agreement between South Africa,
Angola and Cuba that led to independence for Namibia, ruled by
South Africa since it wrested control of the territory from Germany
during World War I. The Soviet government also was involved in the
negotiations.
   South Africa demanded the withdrawal of Cuban troops from
Angola, Namibia's northern neighbor, as a condition of
independence. Cuba has begun a withdrawal of more than 50,000
soldiers from Angola, but fighting continues between the country's
Marxist government and anti-Marxist guerrillas.
   Sources in Washington said on Tuesday dos Santos presented Baker
with a nine-point peace proposal, including a call for a cease-fire
and direct talks with the American-backed National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola, or UNITA.
   Shevardnadze, whose government provides Angola with weapons to
fight UNITA, met with dos Santos on Monday in the Angolan capital
Luanda, before the two flew here for the independence celebrations.
   Baker was scheduled to go to Zaire on Friday for talks with
President Mobutu Sese Seko and UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi, who
already has declared his support for a cease-fire.
   Cease-fire negotiations mediated by Mobutu in June quickly broke
down, and fighting has intensified in recent months.
   Dos Santos has insisted Savimbi's anti-Marxist guerrillas accept
some conditions before a truce can be arranged.
   The U.S. administration official who spoke on condition of
anonymity said a stalemate in the fighting could be a factor in dos
Santos' apparent change of heart.
   Zaire reportedly serves as a transit point for the shipment of
U.S. weapons to Savimbi. American officials have refused to comment
on reports that U.S. aid to UNITA has increased.
   The U.S. official said Baker made it clear to dos Santos that
American support for UNITA will continue until an end to the war is
negotiated.

   The jury foreman in U.S. District Judge
Robert Aguilar's trial expressed outrage at the prosecution's case
after jurors cleared Aguilar of one charge and voted in strong
majorities to acquit him of most other charges.
   The Justice Department said Tuesday it plans to seek a retrial.
   ``I wish the government would go away and find something better
to do,'' San Francisco bank executive Carl D'Amico said after the
six-week obstruction-of-justice and racketeering trial ended Monday
with only one charge resolved.
   Aguilar, a 1980 appointee of President Carter, was acquitted of
one charge of trying to influence a friend's criminal case by
approaching a fellow judge.
   Mistrials were declared on the other seven charges after seven
days of deliberations, with reported jury votes leaning strongly
toward acquittal on most of them.
   They included a 9-3 vote to acquit on an unprecedented charge
that Aguilar had used his federal judgeship as a ``racketeering
enterprise'' to obstruct justice.
   Defense lawyers accused the government of targeting Aguilar as a
liberal judge, an accusation the Justice Department denied but
which apparently hit home with some jurors.
   D'Amico said the case ``approaches a political trial.'' Saying
he was speaking for a number of his fellow jurors, the foreman
called a retrial ``an unfair use of taxpayer money and an affront
to a great judge.''
   But Justice Department spokesman Doug Tillett said the
government intends to retry Aguilar on the remaining charges.
   ``Each trial is different and each jury is different,'' Tillett
said. ``We believe, as we always have, that we have a good case.''
   Aguilar attorney Hugh Levine was not surprised by the decision.
   ``In a case that was not a cause celebre but an ordinary felony
case, I really can't imagine that any kind of prosecutor, state or
federal, who viewed this case dispassionately would seek a
retrial,'' he said. ``But the government has made an enormous
investment and an enormous commitment to this. It would be much
more difficult for them to let go.''
   U.S. District Judge Louis Bechtle, a Philadelphia jurist
assigned to the case by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist,
scheduled the retrial for June 4.
   Aguilar, who remains free without bail, is returning to his San
Jose courthouse, where he has kept a limited calendar of cases
since his indictment last June. He answered no questions after the
verdict but issued a statement thanking God and his lawyers and
adding, ``I look forward to further acquittals.''
   Even if acquitted, Aguilar could still be impeached and removed
from office by Congress, which removed U.S. District Judge Alcee
Hastings of Florida last year despite his acquittal on a bribery
charge.
   But New York University law professor Stephen Gillers, an expert
on judicial ethics, said if Aguilar is acquitted, his conduct
should be viewed as less serious than that of Hastings. Aguilar has
not been accused of seeking personal gain through his office,
Gillers said.
   The jury verdict, though inconclusive, was a rebuff to the
prosecution, which portrayed Aguilar as a judge blinded by his
power and trying to throw his weight around the legal system on
behalf of his friends.
   The heart of the case was an accusation that Aguilar improperly
tried to lobby two colleagues for rulings favoring criminal
defendants: Ronald Cloud, a friend and creditor facing trial for
bank fraud, and Rudy Tham, a former Teamster leader and friend of
one of Aguilar's relatives who was trying to overturn an
embezzlement conviction.
   Aguilar was acquitted of trying to influence Cloud's case, and
the jury deadlocked 9-3 for acquittal on the charge in Tham's case.
Aguilar denied trying to sway either of his colleagues, saying he
wanted only to appear as a character witness for Cloud, and merely
asked about the Tham case's status.
   Another juror, Joan McErlean, said the prosecution failed to
show motive. She said the jury voted 7-5 for conviction on one
charge, that Aguilar had relayed word in 1987 to Abe Chapman, an
ex-convict related to him by marriage, that Chapman was being
wiretapped.

   Another 1,000 Indian soldiers left Sri
Lanka on Tuesday ahead of a withdrawal of the peacekeeping force
scheduled for completion this weekend, military officials said.
   The soldiers sailed for home from the Kankesanthurai port in
northern Jaffna district, said a Sri Lankan military official who
cannot be identified under briefing rules.
   The port on the northern tip of Jaffna Peninsula is 200 miles
north of Colombo.
   With Tuesday's departure, northern Sri Lanka has been completely
evacuated by the Indian troops who arrived in Sri Lanka 2{ years
ago to disarm Tamil guerrillas, the officer said.
   Jaffna has been the center of the seven-year-old Tamil
separatist campaign that was led by several guerrilla groups
including the dominant Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.
   Most militant groups surrendered arms under a July 1987 accord
that allowed Indian troops to be deployed in Sri Lanka's
predominantly Tamil northern and eastern districts. But the Tamil
Tigers, after an initial acceptance, turned their guns on Indian
soldiers and continued the guerrilla war.
   At the height of the jungle war against the Tamil Tigers, about
125,000 Indian troops were deployed in the northeast. A phased
withdrawal began last year after the new government of President
Rane
majority against the Sinhalese-dominated government for its efforts
to make peace with the Tamils.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, make up 18 percent of the
island's 16 million people and claim they are discriminated against
by the Sinhalese majority.
   Sinhalese, who are mostly Buddhists, comprise three-quarters of
the population.

   Street violence broke out between
Hungarians swinging chains and club-wielding Romanians in a
Transylvanian city late Tuesday, leaving at least two dead and 160
injured, hospital officials said.
   Gangs rampaged through downtown Tirgu Mures into the early
morning hours Wednesday in the worst outbreak of violence since the
December revolution that overthrew the late Communist dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu. Tirgu Mures is 250 miles northwest of Bucharest.
   Dozens of casualties were brought into the central hospital as
police and soldiers, armed only with clubs, appeared unable to halt
the clashes, witnesses said.
   Hospital officials confirmed two dead and about 160 injured,
many of them suffering from head wounds. Freelance photographer
Kevin Harvey, a British national, was among those beaten and
clubbed, and was being treated at a local hospital.
   Others told hospital officials of being struck by ethnic
Hungarians swinging chains on the fourth night of fighting between
ethnic Romanians and Hungarians.
   Witnesses said about 4,000 people were involved in the melee in
the center of the town. It was the fourth night of fighting between
ethnic Romanians and ethnic Hungarians seeking greater cultural
autonomy since the overthrow of Ceausescu.
   At the root of the clashes are ethnic Hungarian demands for
separate Hungarian-language public facilities and schools.
   Tirgu Mures is considered a cradle of ethnic Hungarian culture
in Transylvania. The region was ruled by Hungary for centuries, but
was granted to Romania under a 1920 treaty. Most of the estimated
1.7 million ethnic Hungarians in Romania live in Transylvania.
   Ethnic cultures were largely suppressed under the 24-year rule
of Ceausescu and minority groups have become increasingly vocal in
demanding cultural autonomy since his overthrow and Christmas Day
execution.
   Ethnic Hungarians claim that discrimination has continued since
the post-revolutionary government took power.
   The street violence occured despite the nation's provisional
leadership warning that ethnic clashes could destabilize Romania.
The clashes have left 102 injured in Tirgu Mures, including 22 on
Monday.
   ``These kind of demonstrations, as well as any kind of
extremist, nationalist or chauvinistic actions, irrespective of who
they come from, are of the nature to destabilize the national and
international situation of Romania,'' the statement said.
   ``We insist that you go back to your homes in peace,'' said the
communique broadcast Tuesday night over national television and
signed by the executive bureau of the provisional Council of
National Unity, which is acting as a makeshift parliament.
   Late Tuesday night, a spokesman for the Defense Ministry also
appealed for calm over national television.
   There were no reports of the violence in Tirgu Mures on
Bucharest radio or national TV news.
   In Hungaria's capital Budapest, 50,000 people attended a
demonstration to show solidarity with the ethnic Hungarians in
Romania.
   The communique was issued after an emergency meeting of the
ruling 21-man Executive Bureau, following earlier clashes in Tirgu
Mures.
   The clashes have their roots in historical rivalries fueled by
ethnic Hungarian demands that include the use of Hungarian street
signs in areas where many Hungarian live, separate
Hungarian-language television stations, schools and other social
institutions that were largely suppressed under Ceausescu.
   Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Horn on Tuesday summoned
Romania's ambassador to express his government's concern and asked
for immediate United Nations mediation to restore order in the
region, the Hungarian state news agency MTI reported in Budapest.
   Horn also relayed a message from Premier Miklos Nemeth to his
Romanian counterpart, Petre Roman, saying he was ``shocked'' by
news of the reported attacks against ethnic Hungarians in Romania,
MTI said.
   On Monday, hundreds of ax-wielding Romanians attacked the local
headquarters of the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Tirgu Mures,
wounding at least 11.
   The national Rompres press organization said 11 other people
were wounded in subsequent rioting and street fighting.
   Among the most seriously injured, MTI reported, was ethnic
Hungarian writer Andras Suto, the local president of the
organization who suffered broken ribs and an eye injury. MTI said
he was flown to Budapest for treatment at the request of Hungarian
authorities.
   At dawn Tuesday, Romania's army sent reinforcements to Tirgu
Mures to protect the headquaters of the Democratic Union, MTI
reported. There was no immediate confirmation.
   The Hungarian news agency said during the attack on the
headquarters, army and police refused to intervene. The Democratic
Union is leading the ethnic Hungarians' call for greater cultural
and political autonomy.
   A government source said the administration was considering
sending in a mediator to resolve the escalating conflict between
the two ethnic groups.
   ``Every form of conflict is a threat to the revolution,'' said
the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Connecticut Governor Drops Re-election Bid To Avoid Nasty Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUDD EVERHART</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic Gov. William A. O'Neill, the
dominant force in Connecticut politics for almost a decade,
reversed himself Tuesday and said he would not seek a third term in
November.
   O'Neill, who had been saying he was going to run, said he was
loathe to enter what promises to be a nasty and negative campaign.
   ``The modern process of campaigning is a rigorous one. It exacts
a toll on the body and the spirit which, at this point in my
career, I do not choose to pay,'' O'Neill, 59, told a news
conference.
   O'Neill said his poor standing in the polls had little to do
with his decision. And he said his health, which he had previously
said would be the only thing that might keep him from running, was
not a factor; during his nine years in office, he has had a heart
attack, heart bypass surgery and, more recently, colon polyps, one
of which was cancerous.
   He said he and his wife, Nikki, had reached a final decision
late Monday.
   He said he decided he could best serve the state ``by completing
this term of office unfettered and unimpaired by the demands of a
campaign for re-election.''
   A former lieutenant governor, O'Neill became governor on Dec.
31, 1980, when Ella T. Grasso resigned as governor in failing
health. He was elected to full terms in 1982 and 1986.
   Voters have given him poor job approval ratings. O'Neill
attributed that Tuesday to record tax increases passed last year
and lingering, although far less severe, fiscal problems this year.
   Polls released this month showed him as a weak contender in what
will be a three-way race for governor this fall. In addition to a
Democratic and Republican candidate, former Republican U.S. Sen.
Lowell P. Weicker Jr. has entered the race as an independent.
   Weicker said O'Neill was ``a class act'' and said he shared
O'Neill's foreboding about a negative campaign.
   The immediate effect of the governor's announcement was to make
U.S. Rep. Bruce A. Morrison, a liberal four-term congressman, the
front-runner in what is expected to become a crowded field for the
Democratic nomination. He has been campaigning for the nomination
since last fall.
   The leading Republican contender is three-term U.S. Rep. John G.
Rowland.

   Two IRA bombs exploded at a
missiles plant Tuesday, slightly injuring four people, and police
said in a separate attack that gunmen burst into the home of a
Belfast Protestant and killed him in front of his wife.
   The blasts at the Short Brothers plant in east Belfast had been
preceded by warning telephone calls from the Irish Republican Army,
the Royal Ulster Constabulary said.
   Police said the plant was evacuated while officers searched for
more bombs, but no others were found.
   The IRA warnings were telephoned to Belfast media 18 minutes
before the explosions, police said.
   Police said the slaying in north Belfast occurred Tuesday night.
They said at least two masked gunmen broke into the home of Billy
McClure, 43, and shot him to death as his wife watched.
   Later, the Irish People's Liberation Organization claimed
responsibility for the slaying. In a message to Belfast news
organizations, it said it killed him in retaliation for attacks by
Protestant paramilitaries on Roman Catholic hard-liners.
   The organization is a breakaway faction from the Irish National
Liberation Army, which in turn is a splinter group of the mainly
Catholic IRA.
   Police said McClure had been convicted in 1974 for illegal
possession of a gun, but it was not known if he had any links with
Protestant paramilitary groups.
   Brian Feeny, an oficial with the moderate Catholic Social
Democratic and Labor Party, denounced the slaying. ``This murder is
going to increase tensions in north Belfast, which has now become a
virtual killing ground for both sides intent on carrying out
retaliatory shootings,'' Feeny said in a statement.
   ``They achieve nothing. All it does is guarantee that another
Catholic will be killed in an equally sectarian fashion,'' he said.
   Northern Ireland minister John Cope said the IRA bombs were by
``terrorist gangsters ... set on a campaign of destruction for its
own sake _ regardless of whose lives they put at risk.''
   Short Brothers said three other IRA bombs have exploded at the
company's nearby aircraft factory since July 1989.
   After last month's bombing at the aircraft hangar, the IRA
warned there would be further attacks because the company was
involved in government defense contracts.
   A Short Brothers spokesman confirmed the company had a British
Ministry of Defense contract to build the new Starstreak missile.
   Security was tightened and high perimeter fences were built
after the previous bombings, the spokesman said.
   The financially troubled company is the biggest employer in
Northern Ireland. It was state-owned until last year when it was
sold to Canada's Bombardier Inc., an aerospace company.
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and
unite the predominantly Protestant province with the Roman Catholic
Republic of Ireland.

   Singer Gloria Estefan of the hit group
Miami Sound Machine suffered a broken vertebra Tuesday when a truck
ran into the band's bus on a snow-covered highway in the Pocono
Mountains, authorities said.
   The 32-year-old singer was in stable condition at Community
Medical Center in Scranton with a broken vertebra in the middle of
her back, said hospital spokeswoman Nancy Parlo.
   Miss Estefan was not paralyzed, said Dr. William Pfeifer, who
treated her. He refused to say if surgery was planned.
   Five other people and the truck driver were treated at the
hospital and four were later released. They included the singer's
husband, Emilio Estefan Jr., 37, who suffered head and hand
injuries, and their 9-year-old son, Nayib, who suffered a neck
injury, the hospital said.
   Band member Barbara Arecidia, 25, was in stable condition with
back and neck injuries, the hospital said.
   The accident occurred on westbound Interstate 380 about 12:15
p.m. near Tobyhanna, state police said.
   The group was headed for Syracuse, N.Y., for a concert scheduled
for Tuesday night. The rest of the band had already arrived in the
city.
   The Estefans met Monday with President Bush at the White House
to discuss her anti-drug work.
   Their driver, Ron Jones, said he had stopped on the highway when
a tractor-trailer jackknifed in the snow and a truck and bus
stopped behind it. Jones said the bus was pushed into the truck
when another truck rammed it from behind.
   Miss Estefan was asleep on a couch and was thrown to the floor
by the impact, said Jones, who suffered cuts and bruises.
   ``The road was wet and snow-covered,'' said Trooper Joseph
Kearney, the second officer on the scene. ``It was light snow at
that time and slippery. Traffic had stopped.
   ``He (the truck driver) came up on them and was unable to stop.
... He was unable to stop and he should have been. That's the
bottom line.''
   Kearney said the truck driver, identified as Heraldo E. Samuels,
of Scarboro, Ontario, has been cited for driving at an unsafe speed.
   Miss Estefan was nominated in February for best pop vocal
performance by a female for the single ``Don't Wanna Lose You'' in
the Grammy awards.
   Her new album, ``Cuts Both Ways,'' a collection of dance songs
and ballads, was 26th on the Cashbox magazine pop chart for the
week of March 17.
   Being on the road is nothing new for Miss Estefan, who was just
a baby when her family fled from Cuba in 1962.
   She grew up Glorita Fajardo, the shy daughter of a former
bodyguard for the wife of deposed Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista.
Music was at that time, literally, a dream; she would imagine
herself on stage, dressed in black.
   For 10 years, she and Miami Sound Machine have toured the world,
attracting millions of listeners with the sounds of salsa, samba
and conga. With a string of hit singles, including ``Rhythm Is
Gonna Get You'' and the No. 1 ``Anything for You,'' the schedule
moves at the pace of their hottest music.
   She attended the University of Miami, where she met Emilio
Estefan Jr. in 1974. Miami Sound Machine was formed in 1975 under
his direction, and played Hispanic music as well as Top 40 songs in
small halls in Miami.
   Miss Estefan, who coaxed crowds to ``come on baby, do that
conga,'' quickly became the unquestioned star of the band, which
plays Latin-flavored pop and dance tunes.
   The group burst into national prominence in 1985 with the
double-platinum album ``Primitive Love'' and its hit single
``Conga.''
   The band has played to sold-out arenas in recent years, and was
recently formally renamed ``Gloria Estefan and the Miami Sound
Machine.''
   Miss Estefan said in an interview with The Associated Press last
August she has no desire to follow the path of pop stars such as
Diana Ross and Deborah Harry, who left their bands behind to pursue
a solo career.
   The husband-and-wife duo complement each other, the singer said.
   Estefan, the group's manager and producer, has ``a lot of drive
and I'm a couch potato,'' she said recently. ``He pushed me along
and motivated me with a lot of things, and at the same time I keep
him from having a nervous breakdown.''

<HEAD>Assailants Shoot Tear Gas into Two Haitian Schoolyards</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Assailants in a white jeep shot
tear gas canisters into two schoolyards Tuesday, causing hundreds
of primary students to have vomiting fits and setting off panic
downtown, radio stations said.
   It was the latest incident in a surge of violence in Haiti.
   The attackers hit Venezuela Co-Ed School in La Saline, a crowded
seafront slum, at 9 a.m., said privately owned Radio Haiti Inter
and Radio Antilles.
   They said many of the 700 elementary school pupils began
vomiting from the tear gas, and parents rushed to the area to
withdraw their children.
   The Roman Catholic Church's Radio Soleil said the assailants
moments later shot a tear gas canister into nearby Our Lady of
Lourdes Catholic primary girls' school, causing teachers and
students to evacuate the building.
   Both schools were immediately closed.
   The incidents caused hundreds of pedestrians and peddlers to
flee downtown streets and most other schools in the area closed,
but this capital city of 1 million people returned to normal by
noon.
   The Unity Assembly in a communique Monday night denounced
attempts to undermine the civilian government of President Ertha
Pascal-Trouillot.
   ``A forceful criminal movement has been generated to make a
river of blood flow in the country,'' it said.
   The organization is a broad political and civic coalition that
led national protests resulting in the ouster March 10 of military
ruler Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril.
   Late Monday gunmen killed a soldier and wounded seven civilians
while committing several holdups and shooting at passers-by in the
capital.
   Masked thugs beat eight nuns and slashed them with machetes
Sunday at a Catholic girls' school in Port-au-Prince, drawing
strong protests from the French Embassy.
   The U.S. Embassy in a communique Tuesday condemned ``in the
strongest possible terms'' the ``barbarous'' attack.
   Private Radio Cap-Haitien said at least 10 peasants were wounded
Monday in the north coast town of Borgne during a demonstration in
favor of the Pascal-Trouillot government.
   The station said Tuesday that four of the peasants, hospitalized
in nearby Cap-Haitien with bullet wounds, said soldiers fired on
the estimated 2,000 demonstrators without provocation.
   The Unity Assembly chose Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot, a Supreme Court
justice, to succeed Avril and she was inaugurated as provisional
president on March 13, a day after Avril flew into U.S. exile.
   Army chief of staff Lt. Gen. Herard Abraham pledged loyalty to
the new government. But the Haitian military _ ill-equipped and
infested with elements loyal to past dictatorships _ has almost
never intervened to protect civilians from armed marauders.
   The army high command said Tuesday that Maj. Isidore Pongnon,
accused by political and civic groups of responsibility for
widespread human rights abuses, and six other military personnel
were discharged from the army.

<HEAD>Committee Approves Bill Allowing Free Travel Abroad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet citizens would be allowed to travel abroad
freely under a bill approved Tuesday by a parliamentary committee.
   The official news agency Tass said the Supreme Soviet
legislature now will debate the measure and committee members will
insist it be adopted at the current session, which ends in late
April.
   Under provisions of the bill, permission would not be required
for Soviets to leave and return, either for short trips or
permanent residence abroad, Tass said.
   ``A passport for traveling abroad will be issued for a period of
five years to whoever applies for it,'' the news agency said.
   It said state security considerations, criminal proceedings and
incarceration could prevent a person from being issued a passport.
Access to classified materials would allow the Soviet government to
deny an individual a passport for five years, Tass said.
   ``A citizen may lodge an appeal with any authority, up to the
U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet, against a refussal to issue a foreign
travel passport,'' Tass said.
   The bill was introduced by Fyodor Burlatsky, a Supreme Soviet
deputy and well-known political commentator, who called it ``a
major indicator of democratization in the Soviet Union.''
   Members of the committee that approved the measure warned
against delay in solving related issues, including rules on
exchanging money and buying airline tickets.
   Unless flying on the state-run airline Aeroflot or its joint
ventue partner Pan Am, Soviets who want to travel abroad must pay
in hard currency.
   Under newly introduced tourist exchange rates, a $1,000 airline
ticket would cost a Soviet traveler about 6,000 rubles on a foreign
airline. The Aeroflot and Pan Am flights are sold out for more than
a year in advance.
   Last year, 235,000 people left the country for permanent

   Troubled CBS' call for help from Marshal Matt
Dillon left NBC's ``Phantom of the Opera'' choking on trail dust
and helped the network draw second place in the overall ratings
released Tuesday.
   A ``Cheers'' episode on NBC about St. Patrick's Day bar jokes
took first place in the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings for the week ended
March 18. ``America's Funniest Home Videos'' on ABC was second and
``Roseanne,'' also ABC, was third.
   ``Gunsmoke: The Last Apache,'' starring James Arness as the
durable lawman, was No. 7 in the ratings, tied with ABC's ``The
Wonder Years.''
   ``Gunsmoke's'' Sunday night rival, the first half of the
two-part NBC miniseries ``The Phantom of the Opera,'' was 40th,
tied with ``Amen'' and ``Dear John.''
   For the week, NBC finished first with an average rating of 13.8,
its 22nd consecutive week of winning the ratings. CBS was in second
place with 11.7, edging out ABC, which finished with 11.5. Each
ratings point represents 921,000 homes.
   It was the second time in three weeks that CBS finished No. 2,
the network pointed out.
   ``The Simpsons,'' Fox Network's cartoon family, finished 11th in
the ratings with a 17.5 and won against the first half-hour of a
new episode of CBS's ``Murder, She Wrote.'' It was the highest
ranking ever for a regularly scheduled Fox show.
   Here are the Top 10 shows, their networks and ratings:
``Cheers,'' NBC, 22.1; ``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' ABC,
22.0; ``Roseanne,'' ABC, 21.9; ``The Cosby Show,'' NBC, 21.8; ``60
Minutes,'' CBS, 20.4; ``A Different World,'' NBC, 20.3; ``CBS
Sunday Movie _ Gunsmoke: The Last Apache,'' CBS, 19.7; tied with
``The Wonder Years,'' ABC, 19.7; ``Who's the Boss,'' ABC, 18.1;
``In the Heat of the Night,'' NBC, 17.9.
   ABC's ``World News Tonight'' was first in the news show average
ratings for the 10th week in a row, with 10.6, followed by ``NBC
Nightly News'' with 9.2 and the ``CBS Evening News'' with 9.1.
   Jane Pauley's NBC News special, ``Changes,'' was ranked a
respectable 32nd, tied with ``Hunter'' for a 13.2 rating. A repeat
of ``The Karen Carpenter Story,'' CBS' much-advertised effort to
counter the Pauley show, was in 50th place with ``Anything But
Love'' and a 10.8 rating.
   While Marshal Dillon did well, ``Kojak'' on ABC came in 75th for
the Saturday night ``ABC Mystery Movie.'' ``Why, Charlie Brown,
Why,'' a CBS special with the ``Peanuts'' gang dealing with serious
illness, was 65th.

   Census officials were rebuffed Tuesday night
when they tried to count residents staying at the city's largest
shelter for the homeless.
   Activist Mitch Snyder refused to allow a team of census-takers
in the Capitol Hill shelter operated by his advocacy group, the
Community for Creative Non-Violence.
   Snyder, who on Monday broke a nine-day fast in protest of the
city's cuts in spending for the homeless, told the canvassers there
were 1,400 people in the shelter and that about 80 had completed
census forms.
   ``You can't use this census with any degree of legitimacy,''
Snyder said. ``Politicians can use these figures to say anything
that they want them to _ mainly that the problem of homelessness
isn't as bad as the American people have been made to believe
because there's no way that you can legitimately count how many
homeless people that are in this city or in this country.''
   He gave the completed forms to Valerie Lobban, a district office
manager of the Census Bureau.
   Ms. Lobban said that Snyder's actions would not deter her.
   ``We kind of expected what happened here tonight. Mr. Snyder had
publicized his intentions, that he wasn't going to let us in. But
his actions in no way will affect what we're trying to do,'' Ms.
Lobban said.
   She had 80 counters visiting shelters, abandoned buildings,
sidewalks and other locations were the homeless might be found.
   ``Obviously, there will be some people who will fall through the
cracks,'' Ms. Lobban said. ``It may be imposssible to account for
each homeless person in Washington. We want to get a realistic
estimate as to how many there are to make sure that the city gets
its proper amount of federal funding.''
   Wylie Williams, deputy mayor for economic development, estimated
that the city's homeless population had increased 50 percent in the
past eight years _ to approximately 7,500.
   Williams said that the number of homeless women in the city
during that time had gone up from 1,000 to about 2,250 and that the
D.C. government's funding levels for homeless service programs had
more than tripled since 1982 from $8 million to $27.5 million.
   The census effort was important because ``only when we know how
many homeless there are can improvements be made in the delivery of
services,'' he said.
   The City Council on Tuesday refused to restore $19 million cut
by a committee from the fiscal 1991 budget for homeless programs.
   Snyder added that it was unlikely that the enumerators would be
able to find a representative sample of the total amount of
homeless persons who live in the nation's capital.
   ``Homeless people are very resourceful,'' Snyder said. ``They
have to be to survive on the streets. I doubt that the census
takers will be going down every alley in the city, looking into
every shanty and crawl space. These people should be allowed to
have their dignity and not be disturbed in the middle of the night
to accomodate government grandstanding,'' he said.

<HEAD>West Germany To Scrap Resettler Aid; Major Steps Toward Unity

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany said Tuesday it will
scrap as outmoded a 40-year-old aid program for resettling East
Germans in light of the fast pace toward unification.
   The Bonn government also stepped up pressure on its new East
German allies to decide quickly on the future governing coalition
in East Berlin.
   Volker Ruehe, chief of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union, conferred in East Berlin with leaders of the
three-party conservative alliance that placed first in Sunday's
East German elections. Among them was Lothar de Maiziere, chairman
of the East German Christian Democratic Union and likely new
premier.
   Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said the Cabinet decided to
end the resettlement program on July 1. Arriving East Germans then
will stop receiving special treatment.
   West Germany has about 61 million people and East Germany about
16 million.
   Nearly 500,000 East Germans have resettled in West Germany in
the last 14 months. The exodus has devastated East Germany's
economy, strained West German housing and job markets, and worn out
many West Germans' patience for the newcomers.
   Schaeuble said Bonn expects major steps toward unification
following Sunday's election and improved conditions for East
Germans would make special aid unnecessary.
   ``We assume that by summer we will be able to achieve a
currency, economic and social community,'' he said.
   The two Germanys are negotiating a monetary union in which the
West German mark would replace East Germany's currency. They plan
other links as part of an ``economic union'' to help rescue East
Germany's run-down economy and prepare for unification.
   West Germany further plans to provide massive social assistance
to East Germans as the nations come closer together.
   Hans Klein, Kohl's chief spokesman, said the next steps toward
unification were the main topic at the Cabinet meeting. He quoted
Kohl as saying East Germany will have to undertake constitutional
changes to achieve the planned ``currency, economic and social
steps.''
   Kohl reiterated that he does not expect elections for a united
Germany to occur until after West Germany's Dec. 2 elections. He
previously has said all-German elections are unlikely until
sometime next year.
   President Bush called Kohl from Washington on Tuesday to press
the U.S. position that Poland's current borders should be
guaranteed when the two Germanys are united, White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater said.
   ``They did discuss the Polish borders question,'' Fitzwater
said. ``President Bush reiterated our position that we are strongly
supportive of the Helsinki Final Act, which calls for the
inviolability of the Polish borders.''
   Poland's Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki is expected to raise
the issue when he visits Bush this week.
   Schaeuble meanwhile said Tuesday that West Germany wants to send
a ``psychological signal'' to East Germans thinking about moving
west and that it is possible emigres would be encouraged to return
voluntarily.
   Tuesday's Cabinet decision means new East German arrivals would
be denied sudh special benefits as guarantees of a place to stay,
``starting-out money'' and low-interest loans.
   Saarland state said Tuesday it was immediately ending special
resettlement procedures there and would send back any new arrivals.
Bremen _ a city as well as a state _ already has taken that step.
   Kohl was under enormous pressure from leaders of West Germany's
11 states, the population and politicians from a broad spectrum to
eliminate or drastically reduce the special aid.
   The resettlement procedures were designed to help East German
refugees build new lives in West Germany in a Cold War climate when
flights to the West were dangerous and rare.
   In East Berlin on Tuesday, the Christian Democratic Union
confirmed it will nominate de Maiziere as their whip in parliament
but that a decision on the future premier will be made later.
   Ruehe, the West German Christian Democrats' envoy, invited de
Maiziere and other Alliance for Germany leaders to Bonn for talks
with Kohl Wednesday and again called for a broad coalition that
would include the Social Democrats.
   By including the Social Democrats, the conservatives would have
a two-thirds parliamentary majority needed to declare a merger with
West Germany under a provision in the West German constitution.
Such a merger is favored by Kohl and would speed up unification.
   The conservative East German alliance led by the Christian
Democrats fell short of gaining an absolute majority in the
400-seat parliament and needs a coalition partner.
   The Social Democrats, who favor a slower reunification process,
have refused to enter a coalition government.

   Former Philippines first lady Imelda Marcos
arrived in court for the start of her racketeering trial Tuesday
and complained about being tried in the United States.
   ``I am a Filipino citizen. I should be tried in my own country,
the Republic of the Philippines, not in a foreign country,'' Mrs.
Marcos told a crush of reporters before entering the U.S. District
Courthouse.
   ``I pray I will be treated and tried here like an ordinary
American citizen, seeking for justice.''
   Supporters carrying signs reading ``Marcos is Innocent'' and
``Stop Persecuting Mrs. Marcos'' greeted Mrs. Marcos when she
arrived with her attorney, Gerry Spence. Other signs featured
pictures of Mrs. Marcos and her late husband, Ferdinand, with
ex-presidents Nixon, Carter and Reagan.
   Federal marshals did their part to treat her like anyone else,
making Mrs. Marcos run her purse through a metal detector before
allowing her upstairs to the third-floor courtroom, where jury
selection began.
   Several of the prospective jurors said they had heard of the
case but did not know the facts. They also said wealthy people
should be treated equally under the law. Under questioning, several
said they remembered that Mrs. Marcos had many pairs of shoes.
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, is accused of taking part in the illegal
transfer of more than $160 million from the Philippines treasury to
buy Manhattan real estate. The indictment also alleges she
defrauded $165 million from banking institutions to finance the
properties.
   She is being tried with Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi, who is
accused of helping the Marcoses hide their ownership of the real
estate, including commercial buildings on Wall Street, Fifth
Avenue, Madison Avenue and Herald Square.
   Marcos, the ousted Philippines president who was the central
figure in the October 1988 indictment, died Sept. 28 in exile in
Hawaii.
   Judge John F. Keenan began screening the first 25 of 150
prospective jurors who had filled out a preliminary questionnaire
about their eligibility for service.
   Keenan spoke with each potential juror individually in a room
behind the courtroom. Also in the room were the defendants, their
lawyers, prosecutors and reporters.
   Samuel Cerezo, a 51-year-old Transit Authority manager from
suburban Westchester County, was asked what he knew about Mrs.
Marcos. He told the judge he had heard of a huge shoe collection
she left behind when fleeing the Phillipines with her husband in
early 1986.
   Keenan asked Cerezo whether he would hold that against her.
   ``No, my daughter also has a lot of shoes,'' he replied,
prompting a laugh from Mrs. Marcos.
   Cerezo was one of 10 retained as potential jurors. Those not
dismissed for such reasons as work obligations or personal bias
were told to return to court next Tuesday when the final panel is
to be chosen.
   Khashoggi, who arrived shortly after Mrs. Marcos, chatted with
reporters at the defense table.
   In reply to a question about where he would rather be, he
quipped, ``I'd rather be in Mecca, fasting.''
   When asked whether America would be embarrassed by revelations
at the trial, he said, ``No, America is too big to be embarrassed.''
   Khashoggi also said he felt America had ``betrayed'' Mrs. Marcos.
   Mrs. Marcos is charged with racketeering, racketeering
conspiracy, mail fraud and obstruction of justice _ which carry a
maximum sentence of 50 years in prison and a $1 million fine.
   Khashoggi, 54, faces charges of obstruction of justice and mail
fraud, which carry a maximum sentence upon conviction of 10 years
in prison and a $500,000 fine.
   The trial is expected to last three to four months.
   In Washington, meanwhile, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said President Bush had received a letter from Mrs. Marcos.
Fitzwater would not elaborate, saying only that the president could
not respond for legal reasons pertaining to the trial.
   When asked about the letter, defense attorney Spence said Mrs.
Marcos had offered her cooperation in finding funds allegedly taken
from the Philippine government on the condition the money be used
for charity in the Philippines. He said Mrs. Marcos sent the letter
recently and had received no reply.
   In return, she asked Bush for help in returning her husband's
body to his homeland for reburial, Spence said. Marcos was buried
in Hawaii after the present Philippine government refused to allow
his body into the country.

<DATELINE>CARYVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Muddy water surged over Florida's
Panhandle on Tuesday, forcing more than 2,000 people to evacuate
and threatening a major bridge, and water surged into Selma, Ala.,
forcing more evacuations there.
   Flooding also continued in central Georgia.
   At least 11 people have died in Alabama since heavy rain _ more
than 16 inches in some places _ doused that state last week.
   More than 1,500 people had to evacuate in three Florida counties
flooded by the rising Choctawhatchee River. An additional 500
people had to be evacuated from other Panhandle river basins
flooded by water flowing down from Alabama and Georgia.
   The worst Florida flooding has been in the small farming town of
Caryville, about 100 miles west of Tallahassee.
   Most residents cooperated with the evacuation, but a few elderly
people had to be forced from their homes, said Washington County
Sheriff's Deputy Ronyon Campbell.
   ``They were kicking and screaming, but it's for their own
good,'' he said.
   The Choctawhatchee, which inundated Caryville, was expected to
crest during the night at about 21 feet, 9 feet above flood level.
   Three or four families who had boats or could demonstrate their
ability to cope were allowed to remain in Caryville, Campbell said.
   But no one who left could return to the flooded area.
   Hardest hit by flooding was Elba, Ala., where a broken levee let
in the Pea River and White Water Creek and forced about 2,000
residents to flee over the weekend. Water was receding there
Tuesday, but few people were able to return to their homes as power
and phone service remained out.
   Engineers announced Tuesday that the Elba levee had no
structural flaws _ it just wasn't high enough.
   ``The flood wave was larger than it was designed for,'' said
Alton Colvin, area engineer for the Army Corps of Engineers. He
said water poured over the top of the earthen dam, eventually
eroding its base and breaking it open.
   Mayor Fred Moore said the corps couldn't be blamed ``because
they had never realized this much water was going to come in here.''
   At Selma, Ala., between 450 and 500 people evacuated Tuesday as
the Alabama River spread into a miles-wide lake curving around
Selma, said Warren Rhodes, director of the Dallas County emergency
management agency.
   Selma's central business district was just above the raging
waters of the Alabama River, but other neighborhoods and homes and
businesses on the opposite side of the historic Edmund Pettus
Bridge were engulfed.
   At Selma's Elmwood Cemetery, about a half-dozen caskets floated
out of the ground Monday when water crept over the grounds. City
workers in rowboats tied the caskets to trees to keep them from
floating off, but there was nothing more to do until the water
receded.
   In the rural south Alabama town of Geneva, emergency workers
fought against a break in a levee near the courthouse, with
National Guardsmen helping pile sandbags.
   In the Florida Panhandle, westbound Interstate 10 was closed
Monday from Bonifay to Ponce de Leon and will remain closed until
next week because of erosion around the pilings of the highway's
bridge over the Choctawhatchee, said Julian McCrary, district
maintenance engineer for the Florida Department of Transportation
in Chipley.
   High water also closed several other highways in the region.
   Flooding in Georgia wasn't expected to end before Friday.
   In Macon, water swamped the city's water treatment plant.
Residents were advised to boil water before drinking it, and
bottled water was sent to schools, where water fountains were shut
off.
   The Ocmulgee River, with a flood stage of 18 feet, crested near
30 feet early Monday, about 4 feet under the top of a levee
protecting much of Macon.
   The muddy Ocmulgee also inundated the Macon-Bibb County Water
and Sewerage Authority's water treatment plant.
   In metropolitan Atlanta, Gwinnett County officials reported that
two malfunctioning pumps at the Yellow River plant allowed sewage
to overflow from a manhole for several hours.

<TEXT>
   The electoral college, dominated by
elderly deputies elected 40 years ago on mainland China, cast
ballots Wednesday that are expected to give President Lee Teng-hui
his first full six-year term.
   Protests continued for democratic change meanwhile as a student
sit-in at a downtown Taipei park that began Friday with about 200
participants swelled to more than 5,000, including about 50 on a
hunger strike.
   Lee, chairman of the ruling Nationalist Party, was the only
presidential candidate before the assembly, but some members
unhappy with the choice were expected to cast blank ballots in
protest.
   The 752-member electoral college, or National Assembly, began
voting at about 9 a.m. at a tightly guarded meeting hall in a rural
suburb of Taipei. Final results were expected later in the day.
   The 11 assemblymen from the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party were not allowed to vote because they refused to swear
allegiance to the Nationalist government.
   The election has stirred great controversy because the assembly
is controlled by old men who were elected on mainland China in the
1940s and then fled to Taiwan with the rest of the Nationalist
government after losing a civil war to Communist forces in 1949.
   Those deputies, many in their 80s and 90s and in poor health,
were frozen in office to boost the Nationalist claim to still be
the legitimate government of all China. Several voted from
wheelchairs or used canes to walk to the ballot box.
   Public pressure for the electoral college to be scrapped and
replaced by direct presidential elections has dramatically
increased, particularly after some deputies proposed increasing
assembly powers and the members' salaries.
   About 300 protesters led by Huang Hwa, the opposition party's
unofficial presidential candidate, marched to the main road to the
suburban hall Wednesday morning to keep elderly assemblymen from
voting. One delegate was pulled from his car but appeared unharmed.
   A plainclothesman was injured in a scuffle with demonstrators.
   A few dozen students got past about 2,000 police surrounding the
hall. They gathered in front Wednesday to sing patriotic songs and
unfurl protest banners.
   Premier Lee Huan early Wednesday visited the students
demonstrating in Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Park and said the
government would consider their demands.
   The day before, President Lee Teng-hui's office responded to the
pressure by issuing a statement saying he agreed to convene an
emergency conference to discuss changing the country's political
system.
   It said Nationalist and opposition politicians and other leaders
would be invited to take part. No date was set for the meeting.
   Wednesday's election was the first time the National Assembly
was asked to choose as president someone outside the Chiang
Kai-shek family, which ruled Taiwan for nearly 40 years after the
Nationalist retreat from mainland China.
   The assembly elected Chiang Kai-shek president five times and
his eldest son, Chiang Ching-kuo, two times.
   The younger Chiang died in office in January 1988 shortly after
he began a political liberalization program that included the
scrapping of martial law after 38 years and abolition of a ban on
opposition parties.
   Lee Teng-hui was the handpicked vice president of Chiang
Ching-kuo and finished his term as president.
   Lee, 67, is the first native Taiwanese to head the government
and ruling party and is regarded with suspicion by many of the
Nationalist old guard, who believe he is not sufficiently committed
to their dream of one day returning victoriously to rule the
Chinese mainland.

<HEAD>Cheney Blamed for Media Missing Start of Panama Invasion</HEAD>

   The U.S. news media missed the start of the
American invasion of Panama because Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
decided secrecy was more important than ensuring media coverage,
according to a report released Tuesday.
   The report, sponsored by the Pentagon, also criticized Cheney's
press secretary, Pete Williams, for not trying to convince Cheney
to send a group of reporters and photographers to Panama in time to
cover the critical opening battles Dec. 20.
   ``I take the blame for what happened in Panama,'' Williams said
in response to the report. He said the Defense Department was fully
committed to the idea of allowing the news media to cover military
operations, and that steps already were being taken to correct
problems described in the latest study.
   The report also said poor planning by the Defense Department and
the U.S. Southern Command in Panama prevented the media from
providing meaningful coverage of newsworthy events long after they
arrived. Key problems were lack of transportation and too few
briefings on military developments during the brief war.
   The report was written by Fred S. Hoffmann, a former reporter
who until recently was a deputy Pentagon press spokesman.
   Hoffmann made 17 recommendations on ways the Pentagon can ensure
the usefulness of media ``pools,'' or a pre-selected group of U.S.
reporters and photographers who are to accompany a major military
operation in remote areas.
   One of Hoffman's chief recommendations was that plans for
military action include assurances that a pool travels with the
U.S. forces involved. That recommendation was not immediately
accepted, but instead referred for ``further consideration,'' along
with five other suggestions.
   ``Because of a secrecy-driven decision by Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney, the pool was called out too late and arrived too late to
cover the decisive U.S. assaults,'' the report said.
   Hoffmann said Cheney was unduly concerned that word of the
invasion plan could leak out before the American troops arrived in
Panama.
   ``Over the five-year history of Pentagon-sponsored pools,
including a year-long series in the Persian Gulf, hundreds of
newsmen and newswomen demonstrated they could be trusted to respect
essential ground rules, including operational secrecy,'' the report
said.
   ``Unless the Defense Department's leaders are prepared to extend
that trust in hot war situations, the pool will probably be of
little value,'' it said.
   Cheney told Hoffmann that his first priority was safeguarding
the security of the military operation and that ``I was aware of
the conflict'' between that need and the goal of getting the
reporters and photographers to Panama in time.
   ``As Cheney's public affairs advisor, Assistant Defense
Secretary Pete Williams should have foreseen the consequences of a
late pool deployment,'' the report said.
   The American Society of Newspaper Editors criticized Cheney's
delay in alerting the press pool.
   ``Cheney's decision to delay calling the pool until after the
close of office hours and the broadcast of the evening news made
assembling the pool difficult and actually increased the security
problem,'' said Jean Otto, chairman of the ASNE's Press-Bar-Public
Affairs Committee.
   ``Since the creation of the pool, there has been no security
breach involving the press,'' said Otto, who is associate editor of
the Rocky Mountain News in Denver. . ``Cheney's lack of trust has,
instead, breached the right of the press to report, and of
Americans to learn, what happens early in military actions.''

   The electoral college, dominated by
elderly deputies elected 40 years ago on mainland China, cast
ballots Wednesday that are expected to give President Lee Teng-hui
his first full six-year term.
   Protests continued for democratic change meanwhile as a student
sit-in at a downtown Taipei park that began Friday with about 200
participants swelled to more than 5,000, including about 50 on a
hunger strike.
   Lee, chairman of the ruling Nationalist Party, was the only
presidential candidate before the assembly, but some members
unhappy with the choice were expected to cast blank ballots in
protest.
   The 752-member electoral college, or National Assembly, began
voting at about 9 a.m. at a tightly guarded meeting hall in a rural
suburb of Taipei. Final results were expected later in the day.
   The 11 assemblymen from the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party were not allowed to vote because they refused to swear
allegiance to the Nationalist government.
   The election has stirred great controversy because the assembly
is controlled by old men who were elected on mainland China in the
1940s and then fled to Taiwan with the rest of the Nationalist
government after losing a civil war to Communist forces in 1949.
   Those deputies, many in their 80s and 90s and in poor health,
were frozen in office to boost the Nationalist claim to still be
the legitimate government of all China. Several voted from
wheelchairs or used canes to walk to the ballot box.
   Public pressure for the electoral college to be scrapped and
replaced by direct presidential elections has dramatically
increased, particularly after some deputies proposed increasing
assembly powers and the members' salaries.
   About 300 protesters led by Huang Hwa, the opposition party's
unofficial presidential candidate, marched to the main road to the
suburban hall Wednesday morning to keep elderly assemblymen from
voting. One delegate was pulled from his car but appeared unharmed.
   A plainclothesman was injured in a scuffle with demonstrators.
   A few dozen students got past about 2,000 police surrounding the
hall. They gathered in front Wednesday to sing patriotic songs and
unfurl protest banners.
   Premier Lee Huan early Wednesday visited the students
demonstrating in Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Park and said the
government would consider their demands.
   The day before, President Lee Teng-hui's office responded to the
pressure by issuing a statement saying he agreed to convene an
emergency conference to discuss changing the country's political
system.
   It said Nationalist and opposition politicians and other leaders
would be invited to take part. No date was set for the meeting.

   A legion of clipboard-toting counters sought out shelters,
subways and steam grates Tuesday in the broadest attempt ever to
find out te extent of homelessness since it became a national
disgrace in the 1980s.
   The tally went on into the night despite a spring storm that
interrupted the count in Vermont by dumping up to 22 inches of snow
and the refusal of some shelters to allow census-takers inside.
   Some homeless didn't mind the government intrusion.
   ``It shows that they're starting to recognize us as humans and
not the scum of the earth,'' said Chester Broadwell, 21, who
answered questions at the Waystation Shelter in Burlington, Vt.
   No one expects the $2.7 million, one-night U.S. Census Bureau
effort to yield a precise tally of Americans with no fixed address.
Critics fear an undercount will allow the government to justify
cuts in services.
   ``We'll get the vast majority,'' said Barbara Bryant, director
of the Census Bureau, which expected to hit 22,000 shelters and
street sites nationwide.
   ``There are no believable numbers of homeless in America,'' she
said at a news conference in New York. ``This is going to get an
order of the magnitude of the problem.''
   Some shelters offered free blankets and special meals to attract
as many homeless as possible. Nationwide, 15,000 enumerators _ the
federal euphemism for headcounters _ fanned out to visit an untidy
world of shelters, roosts and hideouts.
   St. Paul's Community Shelter in Toledo, Ohio, lured the homeless
with a party.
   ``The biggest fear all of us have is that the dollars will be
allocated according to the numbers that they get, and the numbers
will be significantly lower than the problem,'' said shelter
director Ruth Beshalske.
   But Robert Allen, 28, of Toledo, walked away when counters
approached him.
   ``What are they going to use the numbers for anyway? To tell us
there ain't no homeless problem? Hell, I'm a living example that
there is a problem,'' Allen said. ``We need jobs, not surveys.''
   The homeless _ now estimated to number 250,000 to 3 million _
were asked their name, age, sex, race and marital status.
   It's part of the constitutional mandate for the country to take
stock of itself every 10 years and a throwback to the days when the
count was done with personal interviews instead of computerized
mailings.
   But critics such as David Hayden of the Justice House Community
in suburban Washington, D.C., refused to let counters inside and
said the homeless could easily evade the census.
   ``It's akin to looking for needles in haystacks,'' Hayden said.
``If people with clipboards can find them, so can people with
2-by-4s who want to rob them. They should spend the money on
decent, affordable housing.''
   However, Christine Mulholland, census manager in Milwaukee,
said: ``They remain invisible unless they're counted.''
   The counters, many of whom are homeless and were paid $7.50 an
hour, got six hours of training. In New York City alone, 2,167
sites were tagged as places where the homeless congregate.
   Cold, wet weather in New York City was expected to help census
takers find and count more homeless people.
   ``I expect that it will drive more people indoor to the shelters
and to the subway system,'' Dwayne Mayes, a homeless man working as
a district supervisor for the homeless count.
   From 6 p.m. to midnight, the count was focused on shelters,
armories, missions, church basements, flophouses and hotels
charging less than $12 a night.
   A 2 a.m. to 4 a.m. phase 2 eroed in on bus stations, all-night
restaurants, subway cars, underpasses, bridges, railroad trestles,
cars, bank machine vestibules, park benches, trash bins and other
homeless hangouts.
   In the third phase, lasting until about 8 a.m., counters were to
interview people coming in and out of abandoned buildings. For
their own safety, the counters have been told not to enter the
buildings.
   No sleeping person was supposed to be disturbed. Estimates of
age, race and sex would suffice.
   ``We don't want someone pulling a blanket off someone and find
they are staring at a knife or a pistol,'' said Kenneth Meyer,
assistant regional census manager in New York.
   Census officials say the count will help determine such things
as congressional and state representation and how much taxpayers'
dollars are doled out for homeless programs.
   ``There's no way we can count everybody, but it's to everybody's
advantage to have these people counted,'' said Ray Bancroft, a
census official. ``One obstacle is trying to gain the confidence of
the homeless population to convince them it is to their benefit.''
   Some homeless will elude the counters.
   ``Part of surviving on the street is being able to hide or being
able to look like they are not homeless,'' said Kristin Morse,
assistant director for the Coalition for the Homeless in New York.
   But one who plans to stand up and be counted is Steve Weber, 37,
who sleeps between the skyscrapers of midtown Manhattan and begs
money with a plastic foam cooler lid that says ``Homeless Man _
Please Help.''
   ``Homeless people count, too,'' said Weber, sitting on a
discarded cushion atop a plastic milk crate. ``Just because I ain't
got no money don't mean I ain't a person.''
   Activist Mitch Snyder of the Center for Creative Non-Violence in
Washington has urged the homeless to snub the enumerators. He and
others have burned census forms as a protest.
   ``It is impossible to locate and count more than a small
fraction of America's homeless,'' Snyder said. He said the process
is demeaning because admitting homelessness is ``the final stage of
brokenness.''
   But other advocates plan to cooperate even if the attempt is
imperfect and unlikely to settle the debate over the number of
homeless.
   ``If we didn't count the homeless, it'd be like we're saying
they are non-persons for 10 more years,'' said Bill Friskics-Warren
of the Coalition for the Homeless in Nashville, Tenn.
   Boona Cheema, director of Berkeley-Oakland Support Services in
California, said she planned to help guide the enumerators through
their rounds even though she thought at least half the homeless in
her area would be missed.
   In Sacramento, Calif., a group concerned about assuring the most
complete count of the region's homeless raised money to buy 1,000
blankets to give out at a free dinner at a Salvation Army center.
   ``The message is get a free hot meal and a free blanket and be
counted,'' said Greg Bunker, who was helping to coordinate the
giveaway. ``This won't get all of them, but we think it will be a
help.''

   The Gardner Museum on Tuesday offered a $1 million
reward for information leading to the recovery of a dozen uninsured
art treasures that were stolen in the largest art heist in modern
times.
   Museum Director Anne Hawley said the reward would be paid, no
questions asked, and that it could even go to the thieves if it
were to lead to the safe recovery of the art works.
   She said Sotheby's and Christies, the international art auction
houses, had agreed to underwrite the reward through their own funds
and through help from the art community around the world.
   ``Our firm has never done this before, but there has never been
such a catastrophic art theft,'' Sotheby's president Diana D.
Brooks said in New York. ``This is the most serious theft in our
memory. This is a very sad day for the art world.''
   Hawley said she believed that no member of the museum's staff
had been questioned by the FBI as a possible suspect.
   Investigators, admitting they had few leads, turned their
attention to what may have been similar recent efforts to break
into the Gardner and the Museum of Fine Arts.
   In another art theft, New York City detectives displayed $1
million worth of works stolen from a Soho gallery last month that
were found in a parked car two weeks ago. Police said six suspects
were sought in the theft that included six Leroy Neiman paintings
of European nightlife and an Erte statue.
   In Boston, investigators said about two weeks before Sunday's
theft at least three people took part in an apparently staged
disturbance outside the museum in the early morning.
   One person pounded on the door and begged to be let in to escape
people he had claimed were attacking him, investigators said. When
the guard refused, he got into a car with the two men who had
supposedly attacked him and drove off.
   Museum guards were being interviewed to determine whether any of
those involved in that incident matched the description of the
robbers, who had disguised themselves as police officers and
entered the same door early Sunday, investigators said.
   The investigators, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also
said the thieves removed video cassettes from the Gardner's
surveillance system.
   On Jan. 15, two men who appeared to be police officers tried to
enter the Museum of Fine Arts when it was closed for the Martin
Luther King holiday, said William McAuliffe, the museum's chief of
security.
   The men said they were responding to a summons for aid and asked
a guard to let them in, according to McAuliffe. When the guard went
to check with his supervisor, the men left.
   ``We're checking to see if they were police,'' McAuliffe said.
   Eleven paintings and drawings by Rembrandt, Degas and Vermeer
and other Old Masters were among the works stolen from the Gardner.
The loss was estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
   The doors of the four-story tan-brick museum were posted Tuesday
with signs stating that the museum was closed for the day. The
museum was to reopen Wednesday, the one day of the week the $5
admission fee is suspended.
   A reporter allowed inside saw city police detectives and workers
involved in the museum's security mapping out locations of cameras
and checking the equipment.
   Museum officials said Monday that the collection gathered by the
late Isabella Stewart Gardner was only insured for restoration and
conservation, not for theft.
   The cost of such insurance would be more than the museum's
annual $2.8 million operating budget, and Mrs. Gardner's will bars
the curators from buying and installing replacements, said Barry
Wanger, a museum spokesman.
   Police said the two thieves gained entry by telling two security
guards there was a disturbance in the area. The robbers bound the
guards with tape and spent the next two hours removing the art
works.
   The thieves took two paintings and an etching by Rembrandt,
three paintings and two charcoals by Edgar Degas; one painting each
by Edouard Manet, Jan Vermeer and Govaert Flinck, and a bronze
beaker dating from the Chinese Shang Dynasty, 1,200-1,100 B.C.
   Wanger said the thieves also tried in vain to take a third
Rembrandt, a self-portrait. He gave no further details.
   Several of the pictures, and at least one Rembrandt, were cut
out of their frames, which were connected to an alarm system. The
paintings ranged from matchbook-size to one as big as a desk top.
   Security consultants said while many museums have strict
policies outlining who guards may admit after hours, guards are
often inexperienced, poorly trained and susceptible to being
intimidated or fooled.
   In addition, guards are often in short supply, and museums must
often close exhibits on certain days because of lack of staff to
guard them.
   ``It's very common to see exhibits closed because of a guard
shortage,'' said Steven Keller, a security consultant who was
brought in to supervise security at the Art Institute of Chicago
after thieves stole three Cezanne paintings in 1979.
   ``Most museums put in as many guards as they can afford, but
they usually cut back to a small number at night,'' Keller said.
   Robert Burke, the chief of security at the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington, D.C., said the American Association of
Museums recently recommended that museums adopt firm guidelines on
who guards could admit people into museums after closing hours.

   Republican City Councilwoman Susan Molinari won
her father's old job and Democratic Assemblyman Jose Serrano was
picked to replace a jailed lawmaker in special congressional
elections Tuesday.
   Molinari, 31, will become the youngest member of Congress;
Serrano, 46, will be the only Puerto Rican native to have full
congressional voting rights.
   The elections filled seats vacated by Rep. Guy Molinari, a
Republican who resigned to become Staten Island borough president,
and Rep. Robert Garcia, a Democrat who quit his south Bronx seat
after his conviction in the Wedtech influence peddling scandal.
   In final returns from the Staten Island district, which includes
a sliver of Brooklyn, Molinari had 45,682 votes, or 60 percent, and
Democrat Robert J. Gigante had 25,916 votes, or 34 percent. Two
minor party candidates shared the rest.
   ``I promise to work as hard as possible to represent you on a
national level,'' Molinari told supporters. ``And I pledge tonight
to continue to concern myself with the quality of life issues that
we've worked so hard on.''
   In his impoverished south Bronx district, Serrano outdistanced
Republican Simeon Golar, 61, a former city housing official, and a
third, minor party candidate. With all precincts reporting, Serrano
had 26,719 votes, or 92 percent, and Golar had 2,027 votes, or 8
percent. Conservative Kevin Brawley had 118 votes.
   ``Today we proved that we are capable of preserving our
diversity while building a coalition of pride and respect,''
Serrano, who rose from poverty to political prominence, told
applauding supporters at a Bronx restaurant.
   He was joined by Mayor David Dinkins, who declared that Bronx
voters ``said yes to the ideals of progressive leadership and
unleashed upon the nation a leader of boundless energy and fierce
commitment.''

   Molinari was favored by dint of her own success in the City
Council as well as her father's popularity. Elected to the council
by a 161-vote margin in 1985, she won re-election last year in a
landslide, with 75 percent.
   In campaign appearances, she stressed her experience on the
Council, where she was the lone Republican.
   Molinari also noted the Washington contacts available to her
through her father, who held the seat since 1980 and was
co-chairman of President Bush's campaign in New York in 1988. Bush
attended a fund-raising luncheon that netted the young candidate
$223,000.
   In the Bronx, Serrano had an enormous built-in advantage in
voter registration. Golar, who also held an independent line,
attacked him as the progeny of the Bronx's notorious Democratic
machine.
   The charge was a new one against Serrano, who won his assembly
seat in 1974 as a reformer. He rose to become chairman of the
Education Committee and worked on consumer affairs.
   The district, one of the poorest in the nation, elected Herman
Badillo in 1970 as the first Puerto Rican to serve as a full voting
member of Congress, then elected Garcia, also a Puerto Rican.
   Garcia surrendered on Monday to begin serving a three-year
prison sentence for extorting payoffs from Wedtech, the now-defunct
south Bronx defense contractor.

   A man identifying himself as the hacker who
illegally penetrated a nationwide computer network said he did so
to taunt computer security specialists, The New York Times reported.
   The man called the Times on Tuesday afternoon, identified
himself only as an Australian named Dave, and said he was callng
from outside the country, the newspaper said in Wednesday editions.
   His account could not be confirmed, the Times said.
   The newspaper said, however, that the man offered many details
about recent electronic break-ins that were corroborated by several
targets of the intruder.
   Federal investigators have said that in recent months the
intruder has illegally entered computers at dozens of institutions
in a nationwide telephone linkup, the Internet.
   Once inside the computers, they said, the intruder stole lists
of the passwords that allow users to enter the system, then erased
files to conceal himself.
   Unidentified investigators said federal authorities in Chicago
were close to finding the intruder and several associates, the
Times said. The U.S. attorney's office in Chicago refused to
confirm that.
   The caller said he had intended to tease computer security
experts but not to damage the systems he entered.
   ``It used to be the security guys chase the hackers,'' he said.
``Now it's the hackers chase the security people.''
   Asked if he would continue his illegal activities, the caller
said he might lay low for awhile.
   ``It's getting a bit hot and we went a bit berserk in the past
week,'' he said.

   Edna Ramsaier Yardley, widow and
collaborator of pioneer code-breaker Herbert O. Yardley, died at
her home Tuesday of a stroke. She was 87.
   She was Yardley's assistant in the ``American Black Chamber''
that Yardley established in 1919 in New York City. That group broke
the Japanese diplomatic code in 1921, enabling the United States to
know Japanese negotiating positions in the 1922 Washington naval
disarmament conference.
   A native of Jersey City, she remained in New York after the
chamber was abolished by Secretary of State Henry L. Stimson in
1929 with the oft-quoted aphorism, ``Gentlemen do not read each
other's mail.''
   In 1940 she joined the Army's Signal Intelligence Service, the
organization that again broke Japanese diplomatic codes.
   She left the Army the following year to rejoin Yardley in
establishing a Canadian coding service. She married him in 1944.
   A first marriage ended in divorce. Yardley died in 1958. Mrs.
Yardley is survived by a sister.

   Lithuania's president says the Kremlin is merely
taking a tough initial negotiating stand by ordering Moscow-run
enterprises and agencies in the breakaway Baltic state to resist
alleged takeover efforts.
   In a nationally televised announcement late Monday, the Soviet
government sternly warned Lithuania not to erect customs posts,
introduce a new currency or take over Moscow-run factories without
Kremlin permission.
   The announcement did not say what would happen if Lithuania
ignored the warning, but Soviet troops have in the past few days
carried out unannounced maneuvers that Lithuanians interpret as
aimed at intimidation.
   Soviet jets have buzzed Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, and
troops were reported moved onto the outskirts of the city.

   Now that East Germany has elected a
government, West Germany is preparing to take away the welcome mat
for the thousands of East Germans who have poured across the
border, straining housing and job markets.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, facing an election of his
own on Dec. 2, is under pressure to control an exodus that has
already seen 500,000 East Germans settle in the West over the last
14 months.
   The East German exodus helped spark the fall revolution that
toppled the hard-line Communist regime in East Germany. It has
strained West Germany's social services and crippled the East's
economy.

   The Bush administration is asking Congress to
raise taxes on aviation fuel and airline tickets and allow a new
airport tax as part of a five-year plan for commercial aviation.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner included the $22 billion
proposal in the Federal Aviation Administration's reauthorization
bill sent to Congress on Monday.
   The plan would add up to $12 in airport fees to a roundtrip
airline ticket, increase the tax on tickets from 8 percent to 10
percent and hike aviation fuel taxes by 25 percent, which also
likely would be passed along in higher fares. Congress is likely to
make modifications, however.
   It is the first proposal arising out of the administration's new
national transportation policy, which calls for travelers to
finance a greater share of national transportation systems.

   Speedier injections of clot-busting drugs to
heart attack victims improves their chances of escaping permanent
damage, suggesting that ambulance crews can save lives by
administering this medicine on the way to the hospital, a study
concludes.
   Even when hospitals are prepared to offer this treatment, hours
may pass before patients reach the emergency ward, are evaluated by
heart specialists and eventually hooked up to lines that drip the
medicine into their bloodstreams.
   The new research supports the growing belief that for this
approach to work well, it must be offered fast, perhaps even before
heart attack victims leave their homes.
   The research found that 92 percent of clogged arteries could be
reopened if the medicine was given immediately as a shot. Currently
hospitals administer the medicine as a continuous drip infusion,
which takes longer to set up and is impractical for use by
paramedics.

   Despite predictions of more thefts like the $100
million-plus raid of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, many
museums and galleries have inexperienced, poorly paid guards and
inadequate security systems, experts say.
   To make matters worse, there are only a handful of investigators
trained to probe such crimes, officials said.
   Guards are considered the weakest link in the security chain.
Most are young and receive little better than the minimum wage to
protect million-dollar paintings and sculptures.
   ``We've got to begin to hire career security people,'' said
Steven Keller, a security consultant who was brought in to
supervise security at the Art Institute of Chicago after thieves
stole three Cezanne paintings in 1979.

   A new wave of rap musicians is replacing
drugs, sex and cursing with the Gospel, and using the music of the
streets to save souls.
   Transformation Crusade is one of several rap groups nationwide
with the idea that kids who don't listen to a sermon in church will
listen to a rhyming message brought by muscle-bound, hip-talking
guys with a sound system.
   ``We're not like other rappers, rapping for ourselves. We're
rapping for God and no one else. It's not just entertainment, it's
ministry. We want to see sinners saved and saints released,'' says
the group's rap song, RAP (Righteousness and Praise).
   The group, composed of present and former students at the Rev.
Jerry Falwell's Liberty University, recently released its second
tape.
   ``Because it's unorthodox and untraditional, it reaches those
who are tuning out the Gospel,'' said Andre Sims, 26, a seminary
student at Liberty and a former gang member. ``It's the same
Gospel, it's new and different.''
   Sims said he came to Liberty to learn the Gospel so he could
take it back to the inner city. Rap serves that purpose, he said.
   ``It breaks the stereotype that Christians are sissies, or
white, or nerds,'' said Chris Williamson, 21, a senior majoring in
biblical studies. ``We lift weights. We play basketball.''
   Transformation Crusade started about two years ago ``as a way to
keep our fire alive,'' and to find an application in the streets of
the classwork at Liberty, Sims said.
   Williamson and Daryl Fitzgerald do nearly all of the rapping,
Sims preaches, and Sims' wife, Kathy, 24, designs their costumes
and counsels with young women after the performances.
   ``Even though it's the music of the street, it goes
everywhere,'' says Fitzgerald, 22, a junior psychology major.
   The group, and others like it, is going places.
   Christian rap first began to surface nationally in the mid-1980s
with Christian musicians such as Stephen Wiley, the first to be
signed to a major label moving into territory once held only by
secular rappers.
   Christian rap _ often thought too hip for the traditional
Christian station and perhaps too Christian for the soul stations _
is beginning to be played on the radio, the rappers say.
   But airplay is mostly limited to special shows on Saturday
nights on Christian rock stations, said John Styll, editor and
publisher of CCM (Contemporary Christian Music) magazine in
Nashville, Tenn. The magazine also compiles top-50 lists of
Christian rock. Two rap songs were on CCM's top 50 list for
December.
   ``It's a booming area in Christian music,'' Styll said. ``It's
more lyrically driven. It's the perfect setting for Christian
thought.''
   The groups say they are busy, playing on the road and recording
tapes. In the winter months, Transformation Crusade spends three
weekends a month on the road, mostly playing churches. In the
summer, they take rap to the projects.
   They have played at Myrtle Beach, S.C., in Chicago, New York and
up and down the East Coast. This summer, they plan to go to Los
Angeles.
   Of a performance at the Virginia Correctional Center for Woman,
Chaplain Karen Powell said, ``The music was upbeat. I thought it
would appeal to the women and the experiences they had.''
   Rap DC Talk also grew out of friendships at Liberty University.
The group plays mostly on college campuses and as an opening act
for other Christian groups, said Toby McKeehan. They do about 115
concerts a year.
   McKeehan, who grew up in Washington where the group is now
based, earned the street nickname DC Talk for his rapping while a
teen-ager. Now, he says, the name stands for Decent Christian Talk.
   ``Rap is the type of thing that whatever you're saying, you need
to be strong and bold about it,'' McKeehan said. ``That's the
nature of rap. If you're going to do rap, you've got to be
explicit, whether it's cursing or Christianity, as long as you're
coming strong, the kids are into. They'll listen to what you have
to say.''
   ``It's nice to get on the mainstream,'' said Johnnie Williams of
the Tulsa, Okla.-based ETW (End Time Warriors).
   Sims said the kids on the streets know something's different
about these rappers the minute they see them.
   ``We don't have gold chains, no dancers,'' he said. Some of the
kids don't like it.
   ``Once they hear we're not going to do any cursing, not advocate
drinking and hanging out, they leave. But it's too late. They've
already heard.''

<HEAD>Two Los Angeles-Based CBS Sitcoms Premiere For Some Reason</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There was a time Hollywood was full of talent.
Now it seems full of people with degrees in TV from the University
of Boy Is This Dumb.
   Two CBS sitcoms that resemble doctoral dissertations from that
school are premiering tonight. The worst is ``Normal Life,''
co-starring Moon Unit Zappa and her brother Dweezil as members of a
lovably off-beat family.
   The other is ``Sydney.'' It stars Valerie Bertinelli as a
lovably spunky private eye named Sydney Kells.
   Each show is set in Los Angeles, which certainly is a novel
idea. But a true Los Angeles sitcom requires yogurt, Thank You For
Not Smoking signs, references to other sitcoms and kids who keep
saying, ``That's gross!''
   Neither ``Normal Life'' nor ``Sydney'' have this, though. It's
enough to make you boo CBS for putting them on and taking ``Grand
Slam'' off.
   ``Normal'' is about a free-lance writer (Max Gail) and his
family, which consists of Mom (Cindy ``Laverne &amp; Shirley''
Williams), a 13-year-old boy (Josh Williams), and his older brother
and sister (the Zappa kids).
   The opening credits show a montage of home video shots of the
family. Later on, Dweezil uses a home video camera. Could it be the
writers turned to ABC's ``America's Funniest Home Videos'' for
inspiration? Nah.
   The opening crisis has the daughter fussing over getting Pop to
the airport in time. She fears he'll miss his plane to New York,
where his new play is being cast. Pop enters, emits a few lines,
then withdraws.
   He never is seen again. This indicates he read tonight's script.
The rest of the show features a neighborhood burglar, the youngest
lad's efforts in basketball and the usual drop-in visitors of
Sitcomville.
   The visitors here are a doctor who keeps zapping himself with a
burglar-fighting stun gun, and Moon Unit's best friend, a lovable
flake played by Bess Meyer. The two women like to wear goofy hats.
   The credits say that three writers were required to create this
tableau. Okay, but it has only one good line. The line is: ``So?''
   There remains the burning question of whether the Zappas,
offspring of rock star Frank Zappa and occasional guest veejays on
MTV, can act.
   Well, Dweezil is a good guitar player. But neither he nor Moon
Unit appear quite ready for, er, you know, dialogue.
   (We won't make fun of their names, though. They are children of
the counterculture. We pity the kids of baby boomers. Those poor
urchins are facing life with names like Justin and Kimberly.)
   In ``Sydney,'' Bertinelli, formerly of ``One Day at a Time,''
essays a woman who moves back to Los Angeles from New York to be
closer to her boyfriend, a handsome airline pilot. But he doesn't
call her now.
   He's afraid to make a ... commitment? He feels she doesn't need
him?
   Well, that means it's time to get her life back together again,
to re-start her budding career as a private eye. Good thing she
comes from a police family and that her handsome brother is a cop.
   By gumshoe, he even steers her to a handsome lawyer who, as she
casually confides to a woman friend, is ``semisingle.'' Sure, the
barrister thinks she's too pretty to be a private eye. Sure, she
turns out to be so darn smart and efficient that he ... well, he
goes and hires her.
   There also is a bar in which she hangs out. It's run by an old
pal of her late father. The bar's name is the Blue Collar. Everyone
in it is strictly from Brooks Brothers, though, save for a
greasy-haired geek named Cheezy.
   All this will cure insomnia. However, it must be said that Tom
Byrd, as the dashing pilot, is the one bright spot in a dim show.
He deserves a medal for his deft deliveries of feeble lines.
   Bertinelli is chipper and lovely. But here, she mainly appears
to be an advocate of speed-talking.
   For the record, she is one of four, count 'em, four executive
producers that ``Sydney'' required to get under way.

<HEAD>Methodist Bishop Leads Church Battle Against Drug, Alcohol Abuse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRIGGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The former prostitute and drug addict was testifying about her
life at a Washington church when she turned and shook her finger at
the leader of the United Methodist Church's battle against drug and
alcohol abuse.
   ``This is a spiritual problem, and if you're here to talk about
social programs, then I don't think we're going to get to first
base,'' the woman told Bishop Felton E. May, selected by the
Council of Bishops to head an anti-drug initiative in the 8.9
million-member denomination.
   The next morning, May heard a similar refrain from a hospital
chaplain, who told him doctors, psychologists and others were
agreed drug addicition is a spiritual problem.
   ``I just said, `I'm in the right place in the right time,''' May
recalled in a recent interview.
   While President Bush has declared war on drugs, the denomination
decided to undertake an inititative of its own by appointing May to
lead the church's attack on drug and alcohol abuse. Although
authorized by church law, the denomination had never before
assigned a bishop to a special issue.
   Still, even some of the most committed to the drug fight within
the denomination are skeptical about whether members of local
churches are going to be willing to move over in their pews to make
room for addicts.
   ``The church often gets so caught up in systems, in bureaucracy
... what it misses is taking a risk,'' said the Rev. Cecil Williams
of Glide Memorial United Methodist Church in San Francisco.
``Addicts have to have a place. Pushers have to have a place. Drug
abusers have to have a place they can trust.''
   The church often has not been that place, some of the 700
recovering addicts who regularly meet at Glide Memorial have told
Williams.
   ``They often say: `All they want to do is preach us to hell. ..
. Our pain is not their pain,''' he said. ``Until their pain
becomes our pain, the church is not the church as far as I'm
concerned.''
   The 54-year-old May, who said when he took the job that he was
worried the church would ``shrug its shoulders'' at the initiative,
said after a couple of months on the job he believes United
Methodists are ready for action.
   ``I see a church that has consistently been involved through
resolutions and pronouncements. The day has come to act on those
resolutions and pronouncements, and that is happening now.''
   May and Williams are planning a national conference on drug
abuse in November, and the Health and Welfare Department of the
Board of Global Ministries recently organized an advisory panel on
the public health aspects of the drug crisis.
   In Dallas, the Rev. Patrick Williams of Crest-Moore King United
Methodist Church is leading an effort to persuade area churches to
establish four-block ``drug-free zones.''
   The 54-year-old May said there are reasons for optimism in
battling drugs in the '90s.
   With the growing recognition the United States is an ``addictive
society'' and the failure of other initiatives in the battle
against drugs, there is greater openness to a spiritual approach
that emphasizes the value of each individual, he said.
   In its own war on drug, May has said, ``I think the church must
be reminded of the weapons that are at its disposal: truth,
righteousness, salvation, faith and peace.''
   Williams, who said his church has helped more than 4,500 people
on crack cocaine the last four years, agreed the denomination can
be in the forefront of battling drug abuse.
   ``I did it in my church first, and now that I know, I am
convinced that the United Methodist Church, with the appointment of
Bishop May ... can step ahead of the fray,'' he said. ``The United
Methodist Church can do it if it really wants to.''
   May has asked all United Methodists to light candles in the
windows of their homes each evening as a symbol of hope for ``those
who are hurting and suffering'' and to pray daily for them.

   UAL Corp.'s unions and biggest shareholder
announced a $3.8 billion buyout offer for the airline company, a
mostly cash deal worth about 40 percent less than a debt-financed
effort that collapsed five months ago.
   UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf _ who helped lead last year's
ill-fated buyout deal _ issued a statement Monday saying the board
would consider the offer, which shattered a lull in the maneuvering
for the parent of United Airlines.
   The outcome could help determine the shape of takeovers in the
tight-money atmosphere that has prevailed since the collapse of the
earlier $6.8 billion deal, which contributed to a plunge in the
stock market.

   President Bush could grant the Soviet Union
``most-favored nation'' trading status at the July economic summit
if the Soviets enact legislation permitting free emigration,
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said.
   Bush had announced at his summit meeting with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev last December the United States would begin
negotiating a trade agreement with the Soviets wiping away nearly
half a century of trade friction.
   Mosbacher said Monday most favored status could be granted in
July under certain conditions.

<HEAD>Treasury Bill Yields Rise to Highest Level Since Summer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities rose in the latest auction to their highest level since
last summer.
   The Treasury Department sold $8.1 billion in three-month bills
Monday at an average discount rate of 7.97 percent, up from 7.96
percent last week. Another $8.0 billion was sold in six-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.92 percent, up from 7.89 percent
last week.
   The rates were the highest since three-month bills sold for 7.99
percent on Aug. 21 and six-month bills averaged 8.08 percent on
June 19. Six-month bills also were sold at a 7.92 percent rate last
Oct. 2.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 8.25 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,798.50 and 8.36 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,599.60.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 8.42
percent last week, up from 8.34 percent the previous week.

<HEAD>Coniston Returns To Join Unions in UAL Buyout Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coniston Partners, known for mounting proxy
battles against corporate giants, is in the hunt again for UAL
Corp., and some analysts believe the New York takeover trio will
prevail.
   Coniston announced Monday it was joining with United Airlines'
three unions in a fight using shareholder ballots to unseat UAL's
directors and buy the company for more than $3.8 billion.
   The buyout plan by Coniston's Keith Gollust, Paul Tierney Jr.
and Augustus Oliver mirrors their attack on UAL predecessor Allegis
Corp. in 1987. Coniston also waged a proxy contest for Gillette Co.
in 1988 that it lost, selling its stake in the personal care giant
for a large profit.
   Coniston acquired a stake in Allegis and threatened to oust the
directors if the company did not divest its non-airline businesses,
which Coniston believed were hindering corporate earnings and
depressing share price. Allegis eventually sold the holdings.
   Now Coniston is pushing for a sale of 75 percent of
Chicago-based UAL to the company's employees, contending a buyout
offers shareholders a chance to realize the full value of their
stock.
   UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf said Monday that the board would
consider the offer at a meeting to be held soon. A source said a
meeting was scheduled for Wednesday, but UAL would not confirm the
meeting date.
   Although the buyout group has not disclosed its plans for
financing the bid, analyst Jack Hunter of Howe Barnes Investments
Inc. predicted the board would agree to the sale, perhaps at a
higher price.
   ``I don't think there's going to be a war,'' Hunter said. ``I
think the board wants out.''
   Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. analyst Kevin Murphy said the group's
ability to obtain financing was the key to their plan.
   ``It's going to be hard for them to win a proxy fight unless
they can show the shareholders they've got some financial clout,''
he said.
   Analysts said UAL was worth at least $25 more per share than the
$150 per share in cash and $25 per share in securities the
Coniston-union group is offering.
   The new offer comes nearly seven months after Los Angeles
investor Marvin Davis put UAL into play with a $4.3 billion offer,
and two months after UAL's board offered to help the pilots,
machinists and flight attendants unions develop a viable buyout
bid, which has not materialized.
   Gollust said in a telephone interview that Coniston was mounting
the proxy fight ``based on our disappointment that the board was
unable to produce another transaction.''
   ``Obviously, we reached a point where we felt it was in our
interest and the interest of other stockholders to become more
active,'' he said.
   Coniston, which owns 11.8 percent of UAL's approximately 21.8
million outstanding shares, previously had prodded the board with
the threat of a consent solicitation to dump some of the directors.
   A consent solicitation is similar to a proxy fight but is harder
to win. In a consent solicitation, the party initiating the action
needs to win approval of a majority of all shares outstanding;
winning a proxy fight requires approval of a majority of shares
voting at a meeting.
   UAL's annual meeting is scheduled for April 26.
   Under the Coniston-union plan, stockholders also would receive
non-voting common stock amounting to 25 percent of the total in the
company. Based on the total shares outstanding, the offer would be
worth about $3.8 billion.
   UAL's stock rose $12 to $154.50 a share on the New York Stock
Exchange Monday. The shares recently have traded as low as $121.
   The new offer is about 40 percent less than a $6.8 billion
debt-financed buyout deal led by UAL's pilots and management that
collapsed last Oct. 13.
   That fiasco sparked a 190-point drop in the Dow Jones
industrials average and is considered a major event in the era of
corporate takeovers because it instilled deep skepticism about
whether such deals would continue.

<HEAD>Eastern Cuts First-Class Fares</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines is cutting first class fares by
about 40 percent in an effort to attract more business travelers,
but analysts said carriers on competing routes are unlikely to rush
to make similar reductions.
   ``It will probably be a week before we see matching or lowering
fares,'' said Andrew Geller, analyst with Provident National Bank
in Philadelphia. ``It won't be instantaneous.''
   In a related move, Eastern said Monday it would raise travel
agent commissions for sales of the new, cut-rate tickets.
   The lower fares, called ``Y-Not fares,'' are good for domestic
travel through June 30, carry no penalties, are fully refundable
and can be booked up to flight time.
   Industry analysts expressed surprise at the size of the cuts,
which put Eastern's first-class tickets about 15 percent below the
industry's full coach fares. But they said they did not expect
other carriers to immediately match or lower their rates.
   ``It's a marketing move, a promotional program,'' said Robert
Decker, analyst with Duff &amp; Phelps in Chicago. ``We might see some
selective matching by other airlines but I wouldn't expect a
widespread move at this point.''
   Eastern is reorganizing under bankruptcy court protection from
creditors, where it sought protection following a crippling strike
by pilots, machinists and flight attendants a year ago.
   Eastern claims its 9,000 daily first-class seats are 65 percent
full, although Eastern officials conceded that many passengers now
flying first class on Eastern are frequent flier passengers
upgraded from coach.
   Current industry first class fares between New York and Miami
are $437 one-way, while the lowest full-coach fare is $333,
according to figures supplied by Eastern. The new ``Y-Not'' fare on
that route is $276 one way _ $10 above Eastern's current full-coach
fare.
   Between Chicago and Atlanta, the current first-class, one-way
fare is $537, full-coach is $360 and Eastern's ``Y-Not'' fare is
$298.
   Eastern passengers with full-coach fare tickets will be able to
exchange their tickets for first-class seats for $10 more.
Eastern's full-coach fares, the lowest in the industry, are $10
less than the new fares.
   Eastern said it expects the lower fares to generate about
$400,000 a day more in net revenue. The fares are good for travel
in the United States, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
   Geller said the increase in travel agent commissions would be an
incentive for travel agents, many of whom have been wary of putting
customers on Eastern because of the carrier's financial problems.
   Standard commissions industrywide amount to about 10 percent.
Eastern will boost the commissions on ``Y-Not'' tickets to 15
percent.

<HEAD>General Dynamics Launches $5 Million Advertising Blitz</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Dynamics Corp., the nation's second
largest defense contractor, is spending $5 million on a radio and
newspaper advertising campaign aimed at Washington insiders and
Capitol Hill decision-makers.
   The ads were created before democratic change swept Eastern
Europe and make no mention of a perceived easing of world tensions.
But the pitch is clear: The government should not turn its back on
advances in defense capabilities.
   The campaign also comes as Congress begins debate on next year's
defense budget at a time when pressure to reduce military spending
is at its greatest in a decade.
   ``This is a fairly soft message, but the underlying text is:
Keep the next generation of technology coming,'' said Gordon Adams,
director of the Defense Budget Project, a non-profit analyst group
based in Washington.
   ``I don't think any member of Congress is ever sold by an ad,''
Adams said Monday. ``What the ad does is put the issue on the
table. It says, `This is important. Sit up and take notice.'''
   General Dynamics' first radio spot began airing last week. It
recounts the historic voyage of the USS Nautilus, the nation's
first nuclear submarine, beneath the North Pole on Aug. 3, 1958.
   ``The USS Nautilus creeps forward, threading between the arctic
ice above and the shallow sea bottom below,'' the narrator says.
``The only thing more remarkable than the submarine itself is the
submariner.
   ``Dedication to both has kept us improving submarines since we
built the Navy's first 90 years ago. We're General Dynamics, a
strong company for a strong country.''
   The Nautilus ad is one of six radio spots prepared by
Cleveland-based Wyse Advertising. Budgeted at $5 million annually,
the effort will last at least two years and possibly much longer,
said Chuck DeMund, a General Dynamics executive heading the
campaign.
   Although the advertising budget is small for a Fortune 500
company _ General Dynamics was 41st on last year's list _ it is the
first product-oriented campaign for the St. Louis-based defense
contractor in 20 years.
   ``If you're in the defense business, most of the decision-makers
are inside the Beltway, or so I'm told,'' DeMund said. ``The
Washington emphasis is heavy and pretty obvious.''
   An outline of the campaign distributed to top General Dynamics
officials indicates it is an extension of a mid-1980s attempt to
improve the company's image when its government contracting
operations were under investigation.
   Although the probe later was dropped, ``Our corporate reputation
was in disrepair and we were in the bull's eye of the media's
target,'' wrote Bob Morris, a General Dynamics communications vice
president.
   The earlier ad campaign promoted general topics such as
education and voter registration as an image-booster. ``We decided
it was time to start telling more specifically about what General
Dynamics does for a living,'' DeMund said.
   General Dynamics gets about 90 percent of its business from U.S.
government defense contracts, $6.89 billion in 1989. The company
has more than 100,000 employees and makes Tomahawk cruise missiles
in San Diego; nuclear submarines in Groton, Conn.; F-16 fighter
planes in Fort Worth, Texas; and M-1 tanks in Troy, Mich., and
Lima, Ohio.
   Print ads are appearing in The Wall Street Journal, U.S. News
and World Report, Fortune, National Geographic, Smithsonian, the
National Review and Washington Monthly.
   Robert Costello, chief military procurement official in the
Reagan administration, predicted that as military budgets fall,
other defense contractors will produce similar ads.
   ``Basically, their issue is keeping as much business for their
company as possible _ at the expense of competitors,'' said
Costello, now an analyst at the Hudson Institute, an Indianapolis
think tank. ``Yes, they can have an impact.''
   While its campaign germinated before the changes in Eastern
Europe, General Dynamics is aware of the implications of democratic
reform on military contractors.
   The cover of the company's 1989 annual report is a photograph of
Cortland Bryant, a ship's rigger at General Dynamics' Electric Boat
Division in Groton, Conn., where submarines are built.
   ``I really think this country's tough stand on defense helped to
make all those good things happen over in Europe,'' Bryant is
quoted as saying on the cover. ``Nobody wants a war _ I sure don't
_ and as long as we've got these boats out there, I don't think
we'll have one.''

<HEAD>CFTC Member Proposes Compromise in Turf Battle With SEC</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A member of the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission has proposed setting up an arbitration panel to iron out
the regulatory agency's jursidictional disputes with the rival
Securities and Exchange Commission.
   The compromise suggested Monday by CFTC Commissioner Fowler C.
West called for setting up a five-member Inter-Agency
Jurisdictional Arbitration Panel to resolve disputes at the request
of either agency.
   The plan would require amending the federal laws that created
the CFTC, which oversees the nation's futures markets, and the SEC,
which regulates the stock and bond markets.
   A spokeswoman for the SEC said the agency had no comment on the
proposal.
   The CFTC and the SEC have a long-simmering dispute over which
agency should have the power to regulate so-called ``hybrid''
financial products that share characteristics of both a security
and a futures contract.
   The dispute has heated up since a federal appeals court in
Chicago ruled last year that the CFTC's regulatory authority
extended to financial instruments with even a trace of futures-like
characteristics.
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held that the SEC
overstepped its authority in claiming jurisdiction over hybrid
products created by exchanges in Chicago, New York and Philadelphia.
   The ruling forced those exchanges to stop or never start trading
the products, known as index participations, which allowed
investors to trade on indexes tied to a whole basket of stocks like
the Standard &amp; Poors 500 without actually buying the underlying
stock.
   That prompted SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden to call for reform
to prevent foreign markets from copying innovative U.S. financial
products while their introduction in this country is held up by
court battles.
   Last week Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said it's time to
make some changes. He said the department was studying three
scenarios: merging the CFTC and SEC; giving the SEC authority over
all financial futures contracts or simply giving the SEC power to
regulate stock index futures.
   And two House members, one from the committe that oversees the
SEC the other from the Agriculture Committee that oversees the
CFTC, said last week they were exploring possible legislation to
create a new super regulatory agency with authority over both
securities and financial futures markets.
   The Seante Banking Committee has scheduled a March 29 hearing on
the jurisdictional dispute.
   Under West's proposal, each commission would appoint two
qualified arbitrators, who, in turn, would select a fifth member.
   Jursidictional disputes between the CFTC and the SEC would be
submitted to the panel, which would render a decision within 90
days. The panel's findings would be final and not subject to
reversal.
   ``Federal courts have encouraged arbitration, and arbitration
has been used even to settle disputes over international
territorial boundaries,'' West said. ``I see no reason why
arbitration could not be applied successfully to the gray area of
jurisdictional disputes between these agencies.''
   Rather than creating an expensive new federal bureaucracy, West
said his proposal would be ``taking the current system and making
it work.''
   The arbitration panel could utilize the staff and facilities of
either agency and West estimated it could operate for less than
$1.5 million a year.

   In the late 1980s, Columbia Savings
and Loan television ads showed a man in a suit standing high atop a
graph. Lines on the chart zigzagged up to demonstrate the company's
growth and strength.
   ``I'd say things are headed in the right direction,'' the
pitchman said.
   If the ads ran now, the guy might have to stand in a junkyard _
a metaphor not only for Columbia, but also for other California
S&amp;Ls that diversified away from home-mortgage lending during the
deregulated frenzy of the last decade.
   A third of the state's 21 biggest thrifts are in danger of
failing, even in a state economy that is one of the largest and
healthiest in the world.
   Why are so many California thrifts sick?
   A big reason is bad investments made under deregulation.
   Columbia's years of success, for example, were built on
investments in junk bonds, securities that paid high interest
because they funded risky ventures. Many were sold by Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.'s junk bond purveyor Michael Milken to his
friend and ally, Columbia Chairman Thomas Spiegel.
   Columbia's heap of junk, far bigger than any other thrift's, has
fallen in value by at least $800 million. Because of that, the S&amp;L
no longer meets federal standards for capital reserves _ its cash
cushion against risk.
   Spiegel has resigned. Drexel is in bankruptcy court. Milken is
indicted. The market for the risky securities he helped pioneer has
collapsed.
   Columbia's new president, Edward Harshfield, is trying to sell
the whole $3.5 billion junk bond package. Many observers don't
think he can.
   ``I just have a feeling Columbia may be too far gone,'' said
Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Va.-based financial industry consultant.
   The No. 2 junk bond investor, San Diego's Imperial Savings and
Loan, was seized Feb. 23, the same day regulators took over
Huntington Beach-based Mercury Savings. Mercury had many problems,
but fell into insolvency partly because of another bugbear for
California thrifts _ a risky out-of-state loan.
   The number of thrifts in California boomed in the early 1980s
after federal and state laws were loosened, permitting S&amp;Ls to make
a range of investments. Unlike banks, they originally had been
allowed only to make loans for houses.
   California has about 12 percent of the country's population, but
29 percent of the S&amp;L assets.
   The state hasn't suffered the economic shocks of Texas and other
energy states, which could partly blame the skidding oil business
for their S&amp;L problems, or Arizona, where thrifts were buried when
real estate prices slumped.
   Analysts, regulators and industry officials instead blame shoddy
managers who courted big depositors with high interest rates and
made ill-conceived investments well beyond the Golden State's
borders. Besides junk bonds, California thrifts put money into duds
ranging from stud horses to Yugo cars.
   Honcho thrift entrepreneurs with little experience used their
newfound license to write not just adjustable rate loans, but
commercial and industrial loans, loans on vacant land, ``all that
goofy stuff,'' California S&amp;L Commissioner William Crawford said.
   Making matters worse, many conservative lenders followed suit,
often trying to recoup losses from early fixed-rate mortgage loans
made at low rates. ``A lot of the good monkeys copied the bad
monkeys,'' Crawford said.
   Crawford and Marion Sandler, president of World Savings and Loan
Association, said trying to do business outside the state was the
biggest problem.
   ``First, you don't know the territory, and second you're the
latest pigeon,'' she said.
   Many California thrift managers wrongly assumed every market was
as good as California, said Alex Sheshunoff, the head of an Austin,
Texas-based firm that tracks the thrift industry.
   ``They thought they had geographical risk diversification,''
Sheshunoff said. ``What they wound up with was a piece of every bad
deal no matter where it was.''
   Some of the more prominent thrifts that ventured out-of-state
include Great American Savings Bank of San Diego, now seeking an
investor or buyer after losing $124 million in 1989, largely
because of commercial lending in Arizona.
   Great Western's 1989 profits fell 60 percent because of a $200
million reserve for losses on commercial real-estate loans, most of
them outside California. The company is regarded as healthy
nonetheless.
   Irvine-based Lincoln Savings, the notorious thrift that
regulators say will cost $2 billion to bail out, lost money on
Arizona real estate and junk bonds. It is the biggest S&amp;L collapse
so far.
   Mercury said a soured loan on a hotel in Tulsa, Okla., helped
push it into insolvency. With assets of $2.16 billion, it had a
negative net worth of $33 million when seized.
   San Diego's Imperial had assets of $9.7 billion and a negative
net worth of $60 million when regulators seized it. Besides big
junk bond holdings, Imperial's problems included shaky car loans
and backing the importer of the Yugo, a car U.S. drivers shunned.
   Ely attributes many of the problems to simply too many S&amp;Ls with
too few solid franchises.
   ``There's parallels to the steel industry,'' said Ely. ``What
we're doing is trimming away obsolescence. ... It's the same trend
you see in any mature industry.''

<HEAD>SEC Exploring Price Quote System for Junk Bonds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission is
looking into developing a centralized price quote system for the
market in high-yield, high-risk junk bonds.
   In a letter to a Senate committee, SEC Chairman Richard C.
Breeden said the agency needs to keep closer tabs on the junk bond
market but cautioned against ``overly intrusive'' legislation.
   The letter accompanied an SEC report on junk bonds to the Senate
Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, in which Breeden said
he wanted to improve the availability of information on price and
liquidity of the securities.
   The 84-page SEC report, delivered to the committee last week and
made public Monday, contained information on events and data up
through Fall 1989.
   The committee's chairman, Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich,
requested the study after Campeau Corp. sought bankruptcy
protection for its huge U.S. retailing operations, which it
acquired mainly with money borrowed through junk bonds.
   The report does not deal with the collapse of Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc., the junk bond pioneer whose parent sought bankruptcy
court protection in February. Much of the data in the report came
from Drexel, however.
   The report stated Drexel was the primary underwriter of junk
bond issues with about a 43 percent market share in the first nine
months of 1989.
   The report also estimated the size of the entire junk bond
market at $300 billion to $350 billion.
   The SEC report conceded that much of its information _ including
the numbers of new issues, the size of the secondary market and
involvement of commercial banks in the junk market _ was based
estimates rather than hard data because of what it called ``the
persistent problem of obtaining quality research'' in junk bonds.
   Breeden said improved price information would assist investors,
market participants and regulators and he has asked the SEC's
Division of Market Regulation to study problems in developing a
centralized price quotation system for junk bonds.
   The issue of price quotes for junk bonds was highlighted last
week when Drexel, which is liquidating its holdings, stopped
quoting prices on some 3,000 to 4,000 junk issues. The firm had
been the market's biggest _ and for some issues the only source _
for junk bond quotes.
   Breeden also warned that ``an overly intrusive approach could
create other risks and significant costs.
   ``Therefore, any steps to increase the direct regulation of
trading in high yield securities should be carefully considered due
to their potentially far-reaching implications,'' said Breeden in a
letter to Riegle.
   There was no comment from committee, as the Senate was not in
session Monday.

<TEXT>
   Leon Gorman is leaving his L.L. Bean
boots at home when he joins climbers from three nations this week
in scaling Mount Everest to promote world peace and environmental
protection.
   Instead, the president of the outdoors outfitter famous for its
duck shoes, plaid flannels and huge mail-order business is taking a
pair of backpacking boots and some stiff plastic ones equipped with
crampons for venturing onto glaciers.
   Bean's signature Maine Hunting Boot _ with its leather uppers
and rubber bottoms _ wouldn't be appropriate on 29,028-foot
Everest, the world's highest mountain, along the border of Nepal
and Tibet in the Himalayas, he said.
   Gorman, 55, is participating in the climb as a ``trekker'' who
will follow the nearly 50 expedition members to Camp 3, an advanced
base camp at 21,325 feet where the technical phase of the ascent
begins in earnest.
   ``That's the highest we expect to go,'' Gorman said. ``But if
everything is perfect, we might go on the glacier a little higher
...''
   It's the highest objective ever attempted by Gorman, a
recreational hiker who did virtually all his climbing in northern
Maine's Baxter State Park and the White Mountains of New Hampshire
before joining Jim Whittaker on a climb of 14,410-foot Mount
Rainier in Washington state three years ago.
   Whittaker, who in 1963 became the first American to climb
Everest, organized this year's Everest Peace Club and enlisted
Gorman's company as lead sponsor and official outfitter.
   Included on the expedition were opportunities for physically fit
people with little or no climbing experience to follow in the
footsteps of expedition members to the 17,100-foot base camp or to
advance further up to Camp 3.
   The cost of the treks is nearly $10,000, with proceeds used to
defray the expenses of the expedition _ figured at more than $1
million, with the United States, through corporate sponsors and
individual donors, also paying to outfit Soviet and Chinese
climbers.
   Organizers hope to conclude the ascent on April 22, the 20th
anniversary of Earth Day, with one climber from each country
advancing to the summit.
   The three-nation project is intended to promote international
amity. Its environmental goal is to clean up some of the two tons
of discarded tents, oxygen bottles and other garbage left by
earlier teams of climbers.
   In addition to a $100,000 cash donation for the expedition, L.L.
Bean is supplying climbers with gear ranging from rucksacks and
altimeters to head lamps and wool mittens.
   The food, fuel and equipment, weighing more than 50,000 pounds,
was transported 9,000 miles by ship from Seattle to Hong Kong, then
another 5,000 miles by truck to base camp. The final leg, to
advance base camp, is being made by a herd of 60 yaks, each of
which carries roughly a 110-pound load per trip.
   Gorman said most of the equipment ``is off-the-shelf,'' except
for high-altitude climbing suits custom designed by Bean's product
development staff and three of its vendors for the Everest
expedition.
   The suits are bright red, with yellow pockets and blue shoulder
trim, representing the flag colors of the countries taking part in
the climb, said Jeannie Parker, who coordinated the outfitting of
the expedition for Bean.
   She said the Mount Everest 90 System suits will be offered by
the company in its specialty catalog issued next fall.
   Gorman tuned up for the trip last September with a 4{-day climb
of 19,340-foot Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest summit. It was
there he tested ``power breathing'' techniques designed to
acclimate the body to high-altitude climbing.

<TEXT>
   Canada's ambassador to the United States
lashed out at American fishermen illegally plying his country's
waters, saying the movements heightened the ``risk of injury'' from
Canadian patrol boats.
   Ambassador Derek Burney on Monday cited recent incidents in
which U.S. fishermen have been caught working Canadian waters and
chased back into their own territory.
   ``Warning shots have been fired, but no shots have been fired at
U.S. vessels,'' he told the Gulf of Maine Fisheries in the '90s
conference. ``I would like to keep it that way.
   ``Unfortunately, the risk of injury has been heightened by the
refusal of some U.S. fishermen to obey the legitimate orders of
Canadian fisheries officials.''
   Burney later denied he was threatening U.S. fishermen. ``I don't
want there to be a situation in which shots are fired at fishing
vessels from either country,'' he said. ``Please don't interpret
what I said as saber-rattling.''
   Burney also criticized legislation passed by Congress last year
banning the import of undersized lobsters from Canada. A panel of
officials from both nations is determining whether the law is an
unfair restriction of trade.
   ``Why could we not have asked the panel to give us an advisory
opinion on this issue before the legislation was adopted?'' Burney
said.
   Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, said the
legislation appeared necessary last year when Canada began
increasing its minimum size for lobsters but then backed off.
   New England fishermen complain that Canada's lower size limit
gives Canadian fishermen an unfair advantage. Canadian fishermen
say their size limits are adequate to protect the supply of
lobsters.

<DATELINE>FREMONT, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gerber Products Co. will restructure its
children's clothing business and sell three North Carolina plants,
the company said.
   Gerber Childrenswear Inc. will be streamlined to cut some
products for older children, mainly private-label sleepwear lines
that sold for low prices and brought low returns, said Kent C.
Robinson, president and chief executive officer of Gerber
Childrenswear.
   Robinson, who also is president of Gerber Apparel, said Monday
the plants being sold are a small part of Gerber Childrenswear's
total operations.
   He declined to give the total number of plants or total number
of employees in the unit. But the three plants employ about 600
people in Yadkinville, Greensboro and Salisbury, N.C.
   Gerber said an after-tax reserve of $8.3 million, or 22 cents a
share, would be established by a charge in its fourth fiscal
quarter, ending March 31, to cover anticipated losses on the plant
sales.
   Al Piergallini, Gerber Products chairman, president and chief
executive officer, said fiscal 1990 earnings per share from
continuing operations still were expected to be at least $2.75 a
share, up about 25 percent from comparable earnings for fiscal 1989.
   Gerber Childrenswear is part of the Gerber Apparel Group, which
also includes Buster Brown Apparel Inc. and Weather Tamer Inc.
   Gerber Products Co., also the country's leading producer of baby
foods, employs nearly 15,000 people and reported earnings of $81.4
million on sales of $1.07 billion in its last fiscal year.

<HEAD>Government Promises New Indictment By Mid-April</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said a new indictment of former
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk bond executive Michael Milken
would be ready by mid-April.
   U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood on Monday set a May 1 conference
date to discuss when a trial would begin of one of Wall Street's
most influential figures of the 1980s.
   Milken and two others were indicted last March 29 on 98 counts
of criminal fraud and racketeering involving a range of alleged
securities crimes, some related to insider trading and fraud during
corporate takeovers.
   But the government plans to bring a broader, or superseding,
indictment against Milken that is said to include more charges and
other defendants. The new indictment first was expected last summer
and prosecutors have repeatedly pushed back the date.
   After the first indictment, a March 1, 1990, trial date was
scheduled. Wood said she called Monday's hearing ``in view of the
fact that March 1 has come and gone.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John K. Carroll said the new indictment
would be ready ``no later than the week of April 16.''
   Wood said the two sides would agree upon a definite trial date
when they meet May 1.
   ``Obviously, until we see the superseder we're not in any
position to talk about a trial date,'' Milken attorney Arthur Liman
said. He said the new indictment would require additional
preparation because other defendants were expected to be named.
   But lawyers involved in the case have said in the past they
would need close to a year to prepare for what is expected to be a
lengthy and complicated trial. That would push a trial date back to
early 1991.
   Milken, his brother Lowell, and former Drexel trader Bruce Lee
Newberg were charged with defrauding clients through insider
trading and stock manipulation between 1984 and 1986. They have
pleaded innocent.
   Michael Milken, 43, left Drexel last year and set up a
investment management company.
   Drexel, which pleaded guilty to six felonies and agreed to pay
$650 million in penalties to settle its case with the government,
is going out of business. Its parent company filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy court protection from creditors last month.

<TEXT>
   British executive John C. Cahill, who
wants to buy the 105-year-old Norton Co., calls his firm BTR PLC
his family and Worcester's largest employer a prospective member.
   ``Do I look ruthless? Do I look like Attila the Hun?'' Cahill
said Monday, brushing aside analysts' descriptions of his company
as dogged in pursuit of cost targets.
   But Cahill didn't directly address the question of layoffs
should he acquire the world's leading abrasives manufacturer,
saying, ``I can't respond to that at this moment.''
   Despite Cahill's words, employees of Norton voiced disapproval
of the $1.6 billion hostile takeover bid as about 3,000 workers
marched around city hall Monday.
   ``It's more than just $75 a share. It's our livelihood. It's our
jobs,'' said John Schafer, an organizer of the rally timed to
coincide with Cahill's visit.
   The show of force by Norton employees, enlivened by chants,
renditions of ``God Bless America'' and even the torching of a
Union Jack, didn't seem to deter Cahill, although he did change one
meeting place to skirt the crowd.
   ``I think this is a very healthy sign. They're showing loyalty
and support,'' said Cahill, adding that he had mingled with some of
the earliest ralliers at around 6 a.m.
   In Boston, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis said he was watching the
Norton situation.
   ``I am very concerned. Every time we have one of these hostile
takeovers it seems to be directed at one of our best employers, our
best corporate citizens,'' he said.
   Cahill said he hoped the takeover would marry Norton's technical
prowess with BTR's operating techniques.
   Norton Workers said they don't trust Cahill and fear that if his
bid is successful they could be out of a job or forced to meet
stringent profit ratios. BTR's bid made its first public appearance
in an ad in Friday's Wall Street Journal.
   Among's those at Monday's rally was 87-year-old former chairman
Milton P. Higgins, who was brought to city hall in a wheelchair.
   ``My grandfather was one of the founders of the company. It's
the best company in the city and we don't like to have it sold out
to somebody else. It's as simple as that,'' Higgins said.
   The employees cited BTR's purchase of Worcester Controls Corp.
in 1978 as grounds for their fears. In 1986, the company's
manufacturing operations were moved to North Carolina, although
their corporate offices remain in Marlboro.
   But Cahill maintained that was a decision by management that had
been in place before the BTR purchase and he insisted he had no
such plans for Norton.
   Norton management has said its board is evaluating the offer and
will advise shareholders by March 29. Over the weekend, Norton
lined up a group of advisers, including the investment banking firm
Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.

<HEAD>Economists See Possible Worsening of Trade Deficit</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Will be led with 8:30 a.m. EST release of new report. A
version moving on general news wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. trade deficit, after two years of
steady improvements, could worsen significantly in 1990, economists
say.
   These analysts are concerned that a growing appetite for
imported petroleum and stepped-up demand by consumers for foreign
products will worsen the nation's trade problems.
   Analysts were anxiously awaiting today's report from the
Commerce Department on the merchandise trade deficit in January.
   In advance of the report, many analysts were looking for the
deficit to widen substantially from a $7.2 billion deficit in
December, which was the smallest shortfall in five years.
   Robert Dederick, chief economist of Northern Trust Co. in
Chicago, said he expected a January deficit of $10.5 billion. He
said this would reflect a jump in petroleum imports as oil
companies increased purchases to replenish heating oil supplies
following unusually cold weather in December.
   The merchandise trade deficit showed an 8.4 percent improvement
for all of 1989, dipping to $108.6 billion. That followed a 22
percent drop to $118.5 billion in 1988.
   But many analysts are concerned that the back-to-back deficits
will be erased this year as imports of cars and televisions flood
into the country because a stronger dollar has made those goods
more attractive to American consumers.
   That increased demand, added to the jump in oil imports, could
keep the monthly deficit hovering around $10 billion for the entire
year, some economists said.
   Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting company, said he
was looking for the deficit for all of 1990 to total between $120
billion and $125 billion, which would make it the second worst
imbalance on history. The all-time high was a $152.1 billion
deficit in 1987.
   ``Without a weaker dollar, we are just not going to get an
improvement in trade,'' Evans said. ``We are destined to have bad
trade numbers for some time.''
   Such a forecast could spell trouble for the Bush administration,
which is counting on further gains in exports to help boost the
fortunes of American manufacturers and dampen protectionist
sentiments in Congress.
   Last month, President Bush held a hastily arranged meeting in
California with Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu to press
demands that Japan do more to reduce its trade gap with the United
States, which amounted to $49 billion last year.
   Kaifu promised to make reduction of trade tensions a top
priority, but U.S. critics question whether the verbal commitments
will be turned into significant market-opening moves.
   Sen. John Danforth of Missouri, the ranking Republican on the
Senate trade subcommittee, said Monday that Japanese officials he
met with in Tokyo last week appeared to be more willing to address
U.S. complaints about their closed markets.
   ``There was a recognition that the time had come to redress the
grievances we had,'' said Danforth, who has been a leading critic
of both Japanese trade practices and the way Bush and former
President Reagan addressed them.
   But Danforth told reporters, ``I remain skeptical that the ...
talks are going to lead to the kind of concrete results we hope
for.''
   He said the talks will have to produce more specific sales of
U.S. products to Japan as well as a broader general commitment by
Tokyo to removing impediments.

   Japan's central bank ended weeks of uncertainty for
investors today by raising its key lending rate a full percentage
point, but the move provided no quick fix for the sinking stock
market and weakening yen.
   The Bank of Japan said it raised its official discount rate _
the interest charged on loans to commercial banks _ to 5.25 percent
from 4.25 percent.
   While uncertainty over interest rates had been cited as one
factor in stock prices' recent decline, the Tokyo Stock Exchange's
key index still fell 456.05 points, or 1.48 percent, closing at
30,807.19. It was its lowest closing since 30,678.39 on Jan. 9,
1989.
   That followed a decline of 1,353.20 points, or 4.15 percent, on
Monday, the index's third-largest single-day fall.
   Although higher interest rates generally tend to make a
country's currency more attractive, the yen weakened further.
Traders said the move did not spur yen-buying because the market
had been expecting it soon.
   The dollar gained 0.10 yen Tuesday, closing at 153.65 yen, its
highest closing in three years.
   The yen's failure to respond to the discount raise increase
discouraged stock investors, traders said.
   Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno said Tuesday the bank's
move was ``pre-emptive,'' to maintain price stability, and would
not appreciably slow Japan's economic expansion.
   While not providing an instant remedy, the rate increase would
help both the yen and the stock market in the long run, he said.
   Hiroshi Saito, president of Nippon Steel Corp., told Kyodo News
Service that the action would stabilize financial markets by making
investors think the interest rate has reached its top.
   Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto also said it would contribute
to stability in financial markets while helping to sustain
non-inflationary economic growth led by domestic demand.
   But Hideo Mori, president of Sumitomo Chemical Co., said the
rate increase might damage healthy economic growth.
   Some analysts suggested the problem was waiting too long to
raise the rate.
   ``If the discount rate had been raised when the dollar was about
to surpass the 150-yen line, the dollar could not have risen this
high,'' said Toshiaki Kakimoto, chief economist with Sumitomo Bank.
``Monetary actions should be taken in more flexible fashion.''
   With signs of inflationary pressure growing, the market
originally had expected the rise to come shortly after general
elections on Feb. 18.
   Amid the uncertainty that followed, stock and bond prices and
the yen all continued to weaken.
   So far this year, the dollar has risen by more than 10 yen, or 7
percent, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's 225-share Nikkei Stock
Average has fallen more than 8,100 points, or almost 21 percent.

<HEAD>Apple Introduces Big Mac</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Analysts said Apple Computer's new,
more powerful and speedier Macintosh model shows the company is
continuing its strategy of selling expensive computers with high
margins.
   That's despite recent criticism from Wall Street and some of its
customers that the company desperately needs a low-cost, updated
version of its original Macintosh.
   Apple executives promised to soon get cheaper models of the
enormously popular machines on the market.
   ``We will have new compact machines at lower price points and
modular machines at lower price points,'' said Randy Battat,
Apple's vice president for marketing, said at a news conference on
Monday. He refused to say when those machines will be available.
   Apple's new Macintosh IIfx is based on a speedy version of
Motorola Inc.'s 68030 microprocessor and is twice as fast as the
Macintosh IIci introduced six months ago. It will enable the
company to compete better in the $6 billion a year market for
workstations, which are powerful and fast desktop computers.
   The IIfx costs from $9,696 to $11,497, nearly $3,000 more than
the IIci and in the same range as competing workstations.
   While the new machine won't satisfy critics who blame the
company's recent financial woes on the absence of a cheap
Macintosh, Apple responded to the call for lower prices by
announcing decreases of up to 50 percent on its memory expansion
kits for almost all Macintosh systems, as well as LaserWriter
printers.
   Apple also introduced video display cards that improve graphic
display and will compete with those sold by other companies; a new
release of its implementation of the Unix operating system; and new
training programs for customers and authorized Apple resellers.
   The Macintosh IIfx is available in three configurations _ with a
single floppy disk drive, with an 80-megabyte hard disk drive, or
with a 160-megabyte drive. Each comes with 4 megabytes of internal
memory, and the machine is expandable to 8 megabytes.
   Many of the people who developed the new system originally
worked at such rival workstation makers as Sun Microsystems Inc.
and Apollo Computer.
   William Lempesis, an analyst with Dataquest Inc., a San Jose
market research company, said the new machine shows that Apple is
continuing efforts to better position itself for a greater share of
the high-end corporate computer market, where profits are higher.
   In the last year, Apple's sales have declined, but the company
made more money per machine, indicating a switch in sales toward
higher-priced, more profitable units.
   Lempesis said the Macintosh IIfx will compete with workstations
used for such technical work as computer-aided design.
   ``One of the objections to the Mac has been pure speed and
processing power,'' said Jennifer Aurand, a spokeswoman for
Versacad Corp., a software maker in Huntington Beach, adding that
the new machine ``allows the Mac to compete more directly with
(Sun's) Sparcstation.''
   The new version of Unix also is likely to assist Apple in the
workstation area. Federal government agencies and universities
generally use computers that run the Unix operating system.
   The Macintosh IIfx won a generally enthusiastic response among
industry observers, but the company is still criticized for a lack
of cheap products that has resulted in a loss of sales to companies
selling less expensive IBM-PC compatibles.
   Apple slashed prices by up to 17 percent on its low-end
computers in February after laying off 400 people because of slow
sales. In the first quarter, which ended Dec. 29, profit fell 11
percent to $124.8 million. Revenue grew just 6 percent to $1.49
billion.
   Apple's troubles recently led to a major management shakeup,
including the resignation of two division presidents, and
appointment of a chief operating officer.

   Whitman Corp., continuing a plan to focus on food

explore selling Hussmann Corp., an industrial and commercial
refrigeration equipment maker.
   Whitman also announced Monday that it would use the net proceeds
from any sale of assets to reduce long-term debt and pursue

   It said it also would study a plan of corporate reorganization
designed to create an operating company in place of the current
holding company.
   ``This plan is a strong step forward in the evolution of Whitman

in a statement.
   The announcement regarding Hussmann, which is based in
Bridgeton, Missouri, follows a February statement that Whitman
would concentrate on becoming a strong North American food and
soft-drinks company and sell its investment in Northfield
Laboratories.
   Among Whitman's food and soft drinks holdings are Pepsi-Cola
General Bottlers. It also owns Pet Inc. with brands including Old
El Paso Mexican foods, Progresso soups, Underwood meat spreads and
Whitman chocalates.

<HEAD>Mitchell Says Administration Has Rejected Rostenkowski Proposal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration has demonstrated it is
not concerned about the budget deficit by rejecting a
deficit-reduction proposal by Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, Senate
Majority Leader George J. Mitchell said today.
   ``They have opposed every single specific provision in the
Rostenkowski plan'' while appearing to be conciliatory, Mitchell,
D-Maine, told reporters.
   ``This again demonstrates the president is the cause of the
budget deadlock and only the president can break it,'' Mitchell
said.
   Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, outlined on March 11 a plan for raising taxes; freezing
spending, including Social Security increases; and cutting the
defense budget in order to wipe out the deficit by 1994.
   President Bush said he will consider Rostenkowski's proposal but
repeated his opposition to raising taxes.
   Mitchell noted that Bush's budget director, Richard G. Darman,
had spelled out the administration's opposition to specific parts
of the plan in testimony before a congressional committee last week.
   Bush's State of the Union message ``said in effect that it (the
deficit) is not a problem,'' Mitchell said. ``That is the problem.
When that's changed, when there's some seriousness about it,''
Congress and the administration may be able to agree on significant
deficit reduction, the Democratic leader said.

<HEAD>EC Budget Chief Sees EC Currency in Late 1990s</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   EC Finance Commissioner Henning
Christophersen said today he sees the EC introducing a single
currency in the second half of the 1990s as part of economic and
monetary union in the trade bloc.
   He said making the European currency unit legal tender across
the EC could save up to $24.2 billion a year in bank charges on
transactions among the European Community currencies.
   Christophersen said the ECU would not necessarily replace
existing currencies but its corresponding value could be printed on
one side of coins and bills now in circulation.
   ``I do not exclude that you can have a single currency and also
protect the names of existing currencies,'' he told reporters.
   He added jokingly if consumers feel very European they can pay
with the ``ECU side of bills and coins facing up.'' Alternatively,
they can let the national denomination face upward, he said.
   Currently, the ECU is a basket of existing EC currencies
weighted in favor of the largest economies in the Community.
   Christophersen released the Commission's recommendations for EC
economic and monetary union, the topic of an intergovernmental
conference. That meeting, due to start this year, will discuss the
necessary amendments to the EC treaty.
   ``The benefits of the EC single market will be amplified by
economic and monetary union and a single currency,'' Christophersen
said.
   In addition to a single currency, his report proposes a central
EC bank system, called Eurofed.
   It also recommends the EC states coordinate their budget
policies more closely and that those with serious budget
difficulties solve them before monetary union takes shape.
   Christophersen rejected a British plan for economic and monetary
union under which currencies would float freely against each other.
He said that would result in one currency emerging as the winner.
   But the Commission recommended looser controls on member states'
budget policies than suggested by EC Commission President Jacques
Delors last year.
   Christophersen said EC central banks could have some flexibility
in following Eurofed's policy depending on, for example, regional
circumstances.
   His report lists two key rules for monetary union: EC states
cannot fund deficits by printing money and the EC will not
automatically bail out a member facing serious budgetary problems.
   ``It isa clear message. If a member state is following the wrong
policies it will have to pay the price,'' Christophersen said.
   The central bank system, modeled on the U.S. Federal Reserve
System and the Deutsche Bundesbank, would develop EC monetary
policy and be independent of EC central banks and of the EC
institutions.
   It would comprise the governors of the 12 EC central banks, who
would set monetary targets and interest rates, and a group of
lower-level experts to monitor compliance with these.
   In addition to responsibility for price stability, Eurofed would
have exclusive control over the issuing of ECUs.
   EC finance ministers will review Christophersen's plans at a
meeting in Ireland on March 31.
   The single currency and the central bank would emerge in the
last two stages of the drive to economic and monetary union.
   Under the first stage, starting July 1, the EC states would
tighten their economic policy coordination, free capital movements
and join the European Monetary System's exchange rate mechanism.
Britain has not done the latter.
   The second stage would start after the EC treaty has been
amended, which might be by Jan. 1, 1994. During the third stage,
which may take another three years, the EC would institute a single
currency and create a central bank.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
higher in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
extending their gains on buying inspired more by bullish chart
signals than supply-and-demand factors.
   The rally in the soybean market surprised analysts who had
predicted profit-taking after Monday's strong advance.
   Buying interest swelled as prices climbed, said John Frazier,
director of the agricultural futures trading for Gerald Inc.
   ``It looks like everybody's got their bull horns out right
now,'' he said of the soybean market. ``Everybody thinks it's going
through the roof.''
   Some soybean buying was prompted by private estimates that the
Brazilian soybean crop now being harvested will be smaller than the
20.5 million metric tons forecast by the U.S. Agriculture
Department.
   Wheat futures continued to be led higher by signs of relatively
tight supplies for delivery against the March contract, which
expires tomorrow.
   In early trading, wheat futures were \ cent to 2{ cents higher
with the contract for delivery in March at $4.01 a bushel; corn was
\ cent to 1 cent higher with March at $2.51} a bushel; oats were
unchanged to \ cent lower with March at $1.48{ a bushel; soybeans
were 1\ cents to 3} cents higher with March at $5.91{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were lower while pork futures were mixed in early

   Live cattle futures were .25 cent to .37 cent lower with April
at 77.77 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .40 cent
lower with March at 82.70 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent

<TEXT>
   Ames Department Store Inc., which in
January announced it expected to post its first annual loss, has
suspended the company's annual 10 cents a share common stock
dividend.
   Directors of the Rocky Hill-based Ames said Monday that the
dividend would not be paid until the company becomes profitable
again. The company's last quarterly dividend of 2{ cents, was paid
Thursday.
   Ames is expected to release its 1989-90 financial report within
three weeks, and company officials have conceded the news will not
be good. Retail analysts have predicted Ames might have lost more
than $1 per share, or more than $37 million.
   Ames has attributed its financial troubles to a weak retail
environment and problems at the Zayre chain of discount stores,
which it acquired in October 1988.
   In January, Ames said it would post its first annual loss and
that it would take a number of cost-cutting measures, including
laying off 85 workers.
   Douglas Ewing, Ames director of investor relations, said the
decision to discontinue the common stock dividend will save the
company about $3.7 million a year.
   ``Given that dividends are really a distribution of earnings,
and that we're operating at a loss for 1989, there's a rationale in
that,'' Ewing said. ``No earnings, no dividend.''
   The dividend suspension, announced about an hour before the
stock market's close Monday, caused Ames stock to drop 37{ cents,
to $5.62{ cents a share, on heavier-than-average trading volume on
the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has been dropping steadily
since January, when it was selling for about $9 a share.

   U.S. shares were higher around midday today,

   A man who acted as an adviser in
numerous corporate takeovers pleaded guilty today to stealing $1
million from his proxy solicitation firm between 1987 and 1989.
   Donald C. Carter, chairman of The Carter Organization Inc., also
pleaded guilty to falsifying personal state income taxes and
falsifying tax returns, said Ronald Goldstock, director of the
state Organized Crime Task Force.
   Carter entered the plea before Justice George F. Roberts in
state Supreme Court in Manhattan, although the announcement was
made at the task force offices in Westchester County.
   Carter, 41, of Old Brookville, pleaded guilty to grand larceny,
filing a false and fraudulent personal income tax return. He faces
up to seven years in prison.
   Among the victims of Carter's thefts were many of the nation's
largest and best-known companies, including Union Carbide Corp.,
Shell Oil and Caesar's World Inc.
   The Carter Organization represented leading takeover specialists
such as Saul Steinberg, T. Boone Pickens and Carl Icahn.
   According to Goldstock, Carter routinely billed his clients for
non-existent or inflated expenses between 1984-89, supplying false
information to justify the bogus invoices.
   Carter has agreed to establish a $1 million escrow fund to make
restitution to the victims, Goldstock said. He also admitted
falsifying a New York state tax return in 1986, including charging
hundreds of thousands of dollars in personal expenses as business
expenses.
   The personal expenses included renovation to Carter's Manhattan
apartment. He also owes New York State an estimated $2 million in
taxes, penalties and interest, Goldstock said.

<HEAD>Analysts Divided Over Whether Rate Rise Will Stifle Inflation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLAYTON NAFF</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's economy should slow due to Tuesday's hike
in a key interest rate, but there are questions about whether
another big increase is needed to douse inflationary fires,
analysts said.
   The question for most was whether the discount rate hike would
revive the sagging yen, a key cause of inflationary speculation and
stock market instability.
   ``The latest discount rate will bite,'' said Richard Koo, senior
economist at Nomura Research Institute. ``But this kind of thing
operates with a lag.''
   The Bank of Japan raised its discount rate by 1 percentage point
Tuesday to 5.25 percent. It was the fourth hike of a series
intended primarily to fight inflation.
   The rate _ the interest charged on loans to commercial banks _
was 2.5 percent last May.
   Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno called the increase
``pre-emptive,'' saying it would ease latent inflationary pressures
without appreciably slowing Japan's economic expansion.
   Japan already has some of the world's highest prices. Throughout
the 1980s, Japan managed to keep consumer prices stable and
wholesale prices tumbled in the late '80s as the yen's value shot
up. Only land prices rose sharply, by as much as 90 percent
annually.
   But recently, the costs of items ranging from beer to school
tuition have been rising.
   Last year, Japanese inflation was about 3 percent, but fully
half of the increase was attributed to a 3 percent sales tax
imposed in April. Economists predict that, excluding effects of the
tax, inflation will rise by about 1 percentage point to 2.5 percent
this year.
   The Bank of Japan has blamed the weakening yen _ along with
labor shortages and a growing money supply _ for much of the
inflation problem. So far this year, the yen has fallen 7 percent
against the U.S. dollar. The weaker yen fuels inflation by raising
the cost of imports.
   Kenneth S. Courtis, senior economist with DB Capital Markets
Asia, said the money supply growing twice as fast in Japan as in
the United States. With the supply of yen far outstripping demand,
the central bank's rate hike was inadequate, he said.
   ``Japanese rates will have to go up much higher to support the
yen,'' he said.
   The dollar rose to 153.65 yen on Tuesday from Monday's 153.55
yen, the highest close since its 153.69 yen level of March 12, 1987.
   Courtis predicted the yen would fall to 165 against the dollar,
pushing the Japanese inflation rate to about 2.5 percent.
   But others said inflation may have peaked, if the rate hike
stabilizes the yen.
   Economist Atsuko Kitamura of Yasuda Trust Bank said hotels,
taxis and other services were likely to raise their prices in
April. But she noted the cost of golf club memberships _ an early
indicator of land price trends in Japan _ was slipping.
   Koo said the central bank's action paved the way for an
investment slowdown. He predicted the long-term prime rate would
now go up half a point to 8 percent.
   ``How many people can afford to borrow at 8 percent to speculate
in land?'' he said.
   But others felt the market had adjusted in advance to the widely
anticipated rate increase.
   Jan VanDenBerg, an economist with Merrill Lynch, said larger
companies would react to the higher cost of capital by laying off
part-time workers, reducing orders to suppliers and cutting
production.
   But despite this economic cooling, another increase might be
required to trim land prices, she said.
   Jason James, a strategic analyst with James Capel Pacific, said
the market continued to shun the yen because the cost of land and
other assets in Japan was much higher than abroad, reducing
investment yields.
   James speculated there remained ``a 50-50 chance'' that the Bank
of Japan would have to raise the discount rate again this year.

   The U.S. trade deficit, bloated by a record
demand for foreign oil, worsened dramatically in January, climbing
to $9.3 billion, the government said today.
   The Commerce Department said the January deficit was 20.5
percent larger than December's $7.7 billion imbalance. Most of the
deterioration came from a 44 percent surge in oil shipments.
   The January deficit was an ominous beginning for the new decade.
Many analysts believe America's trade woes will worsen in coming
years as U.S. dependence on foreign oil grows.
   For January, exports climbed to an all-time high of $32.1
billion, 4 percent above the December level.
   However, this gain was swamped by a 7.3 percent surge in
imports, which increased to $41.3 billion.
   The trade deficit, the difference between imports and exports,
was the largest since a $10.1 billion imbalance in November.
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
the January increase showed export growth has been outpacing growth
in imports.
   ``These numbers are pretty much as expected due to the deficit
drop in December, which was the lowest in five years. Everyone
seemed to realize they couldn't maintain that low level, and so it
was expected that there would be an increase in January,''
Fitzwater said.
   The U.S. trade deficit has been improving for the past two
years, falling to $109 billion last year, down 8 percent from 1988.
   But many economists predicted the 1990 deficit could begin
rising again because of the oil bill and gains in the value of the
dollar. A stronger U.S. currency makes imports cheaper for
Americans and U.S. products less competitive on overseas markets.
   The huge 44 percent surge in oil imports did not come as a
surprise, with analysts blaming the rise on December's record cold
weather, which caused oil companies to import heavily in January to
restock depleted supplies.
   The total volume of oil, 291,278 barrels, was an all-time high,
topping a previous record set in August.
   Prices shot up to $20.13 per barrel, pushing the total oil bill
to $5.86 billion, the highest total dollar amount snce August 1982,
a month when the volume was less but the price per barrel was
higher.
   The American Petroleum Institute has reported that foreign oil
accounted for a record 54 percent of consumption in January as
domestic production fell to its lowest level in a quarter century.
   Another factor swelling the deficit in January was a 31 percent
surge in imports of clothing, which totaled $3.1 billion in January.
   As usual, the deficit with Japan was the largest of any country.
However, at $2.9 billion, it was at the lowest level since December
1984.
   The Bush administration has been pressing the Japanese to do
more to purchase U.S. exports as a way of reducing the huge annual
deficit of $49 billion that America is running with Japan.
   Other big deficits included Taiwan, $1.2 billion; China, $800
million; Canada, $600 million, and the countries of Western Europe,
$300 million.
   Many economists are worried that the deficit will worsen even
further in coming months.
   Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting company, said he
was looking for the deficit for all of 1990 to total between $120
billion and $125 billion, which would make it the second worst
imbalance on history. The all-time high was a $152.1 billion
deficit in 1987.
   ``Without a weaker dollar, we are just not going to get an
improvement in trade,'' Evans said. ``We are destined to have bad
trade numbers for some time.''
   Such a forecast could spell trouble for the Bush administration,
which is counting on further gains in exports to help boost the
fortunes of American manufacturers and dampen protectionist
sentiments in Congress.
   Last month, President Bush held a hastily arranged meeting in
California with Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu to press
demands that Japan do more to reduce its trade gap with the United
States, which amounted to $49 billion last year.
   Kaifu promised to make reduction of trade tensions a top
priority, but U.S. critics question whether the verbal commitments
will be turned into significant market-opening moves.
   Sen. John Danforth of Missouri, the ranking Republican on the
Senate trade subcommittee, said Monday that Japanese officials he
met with in Tokyo last week appeared to be more willing to address
U.S. complaints about their closed markets.
   ``There was a recognition that the time had come to redress the
grievances we had,'' said Danforth, who has been a leading critic
of both Japanese trade practices and the way Bush and former
President Reagan addressed them.
   But Danforth told reporters, ``I remain skeptical that the ...
talks are going to lead to the kind of concrete results we hope
for.''
   He said the talks will have to produce more specific sales of
U.S. products to Japan as well as a broader general commitment by
Tokyo to removing impediments.

   A record increase in clothing costs helped
push consumer inflation to a brisk 0.5 percent in February, despite
the biggest one-month drop in fuel oil prices in 55 years, the
government said today.
   The gain in the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index came on
top of a huge 1.1 percent rise in January, the steepest in 7{ years.
   A turn-of-the-year cold snap sent energy and food costs soaring
in January. Fuel oil prices recovered with warmer-than-usual
temperatures in February.
   However, food prices are taking longer to snap back and clothing
costs posted the largest seasonally adjusted monthly rise in 43
years, accounting for about two-fifths of the overall gain.
   ``It's a nasty little number, worse than we thought it would
be,'' said economist Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co.
International Inc. ``The problems we had in January still appear to
be lingering in February.''
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said: ``We must remain vigilant against any increase in inflation.
But the inflation level has been relatively steady for some time in
spite of the weather-related and energy-related surges. Overall, we
continue to believe that inflation is low and under control.''
   Taken together, the first two months of the year represent an
annual inflation rate of 9.9 percent. However, most analysts expect
a succession of milder reports this year and look toward a 1990
rate just under last year's 4.6 percent.
   In a separate report, the Commerce Department said the U.S.
trade deficit widened to $9.3 billion in January, up from $7.7
billion in December. The deficit worsened despite a 4 percent climb
in exports to an all-time high of $32.1 billion.
   Many stock and bond prices fell in reaction to the reports.
Although the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 3.83 points
at 2,759.46 in the first half hour of trading, bond prices declined
and the broader stock market was lower. Declining issues
outnumbered gains by around 3 to 2 on the New York Stock Exchange.
   In advance, most analysts had been expecting only half as much
inflation. Traders took the price rise, coupled with the economic
strength suggested by the export number, as an indication the
Federal Reserve Board will not soon lower interest rates.
   In a related report, the Labor Department said U.S. workers
earnings rose 0.3 percent in February after adjustments for
inflation and seasonal factors. That followed a 1.2 percent drop in
January, much steeper than an earlier government estimate of 0.7
percent.
   Energy prices overall were down 0.7 percent in February
following a 5.1 percent gain in January.
   The department said fuel oil, which advanced 26.3 percent in
January, fell back 18.7 percent in February, a record since 1935
when the government first began tracking the price.
   Gasoline rose 0.8 percent after a 7.7 percent rise. Natural gas
and electricity rose 0.6 percent after a 0.3 percent increase.
   Food costs rose 0.5 percent in February after a large 1.8
percent rise in January.
   Dairy products rose 0.9 percent. So did fruit and vegetables,
following a 10.2 percent rise in January after a freeze ruined
crops from Texas to Florida.
   Tomatoes jumped 30.7 percent in February. For the two months
combined, they were up 129.4 percent.
   There were declines for sugar and sweets and fats and oils.
   Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, prices rose
0.5 percent. This ``core'' number is generally considered a better
indication of underlying inflation pressures.
   However, it was driven higher by an unusual 3.3 percent rise in
clothing and upkeep prices. On a seasonally adjusted basis, it was
the sharpest rise since 1947 when that series of numbers was first
recorded.
   A department analyst said spring fashion lines were introduced
earlier in the year than normal, throwing off the department's
statistical adjustments.
   Infant's and toddler's clothing rose 10.3 percent. Women's and
girls' clothing was up 5 percent, while men's and boys' clothes
rose 1.2 percent.
   There was a 0.2 percent drop in new car prices as dealers tried
a new round of incentives to stimulate lagging sales.
   The various changes left the Consumer Price Index at 128.0
before seasonal adjustments. That meant that a hypothetical
selection of goods and services costing $100 in the 1982-84 base
period would have cost $128 last month, up from $121.60 a year
earlier.
   In other details, the department said services rose 0.4 percent,
including a gain of 0.8 percent for medical care.
   For the year, analysts expect inflation to be stable. Low
unemployment is keeping wage increases from abating. But
sluggishness, particularly in manufacturing, is keeping inflation
from getting out of control.
   ``The economy is too strong for inflation to go down, but it's
still ... too weak for inflation to really be rising very much,''
said economist Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch.

<HEAD>Three Submit Preliminary Bids For MiniScribe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONGMONT, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   MiniScribe Corp., the financially
troubled computer disk drive maker, has received three preliminary
bids from potential buyers, chairman Richard Rifenburgh reported.
   Rifenburgh said Monday the company expects formal offers from at
least two of the bidders later this week. Rifenburgh would not
reveal the names of the bidders nor their preliminary offers, but
he said he was optimistic a deal could be struck.
   ``I'm now convinced that one of these three offers will be the
winning bid and the buyers will go forward with (MiniScribe's)
product,'' he said. ``We're very, very pleased that it looks like
we'll continue to have a going concern in MiniScribe.''
   The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization on
Jan. 1. MiniScribe must be sold by April 4 or face a court-ordered
bank auction.
   Company officials have estimated that MiniScribe's assets would
bring $35 million to $50 million in a liquidation sale. But
officials say the company is worth substantially more if it is
purchased as a going concern.
   The company's new line of 1-inch-high disk drives, now in
limited production overseas, is viewed as its most valuable asset.

<HEAD>ConAgra Reports Record Third Quarter, Nine-Month Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ConAgra Inc. Tuesday reported a 17.8 percent
increase in its third-quarter profit, boosted by a significant gain
in its prepared foods business.
   The Omaha-based food conglomerate said it earned $44.2 million,
or 36 cents a share, in the three months ended Feb. 25, up from
$37.6 million, or 31 cents a share, in the previous year's third
quarter.
   Sales rose 33.5 percent to $3.63 billion from $2.72 billion.
   Through the first three quarters of ConAgra's 1990 fiscal year,
the company had income of $158.2 million, or $1.28 a share, a 19.3
percent gain over $132.5 million, or $1.10 a share, a year earlier.
   Nine-month sales totaled $11.49 billion, a 37.4 percent increase
over $8.37 billion the year before.
   The third quarter and nine month per share results reflect a
three-for-two split on ConAgra's common stock effective Dec. 1,
1989.
   ``We've often emphasized the strength ConAgra derives from our
strategy to grow across the food chain,'' said Charles M. Harper,
chairman and chief executive officer. ``This year our company has
abundant evidence of exciting food chain activity ranging from
successful new consumer products to international growth.''
   During the third quarter and nine months, ConAgra's largest
industry segment, Prepared Foods, had a significant operating
profit gain.
   The company said it also had growth in its frozen foods, fresh
meat and poultry businesses, while earnings were down in turkey
products and weak in pork product sales.

   U.S. shares were lower this afternoon following
negative economic reports and another tumble on the Tokyo stock
market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 5.18 points at
2,750.45 at 2 p.m. EST. Declining issues edged out advances by
around 4 to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 820 issues down,
611 up and 488 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 127.44 million shares.
   After shrugging off negative economic news and advancing earlier
in the session, stocks turned lower in the afternoon.
   The government reported today that consumer inflation was 0.5
percent in February and the U.S. trade deficit worsened
dramatically in January, climbing to $9.3 billion.
   The January trade deficit was 20.5 percent larger than
December's $7.7 billion imbalance. Most of the deterioration came
from a 44 percent surge in oil imports.
   In addition, the Tokyo stock market took a sharp dive again
today, as neither currency market intervention nor an interest rate
boost by the central bank stopped the weakening of the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which plunged 1,353.20
points, or 4.15 percent, on Monday in its third-largest single-day
fall, tumbled another 456.05 points, or 1.48 percent, today.
   The New York market had tumbled initially Monday in the wake of
that day's slide in Japan, but later recovered in an afternoon
rally.
   The Dow Jones average finished 14.41 points higher Monday at
2,755.63, its highest close since it stood at 2,760.67 on Jan. 11.
   Today, the NYSE's composite index of all its listed common

<HEAD>Shaine Investors Settle 2{ Years After `Black Monday'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 2{ years after the stock
market collapse of 1987, creditors of a failed brokerage firm have
reached a settlement with former options investors who lost $12.4
million on Black Monday.
   The 60 investors, enrolled in a high-risk options trading
program with H.B. Shaine &amp; Co. at the time of the Oct. 19, 1987,
crash, will pay $3.4 million _ or an average of about $57,000 each
_ of the $12.4 million worth of trading losses they piled up. The
settlement was approved Monday by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Laurence
Howard.
   Shaine, a locally based retail brokerage firm, was ordered
liquidated by a federal judge on Oct. 20, one day after Wall
Street's record collapse. It was taken over by Securities Investors
Protection Corp., a federal agency that insures brokerage accounts.
   The remaining losses owed to creditors will be absorbed by the
brokerage's large creditors or paid by its owners and directors.
   The largest single creditor is Options Clearing Corp., the
Chicago clearinghouse that handles options transactions. Other
creditors include banks that loaned Shaine money.
   The investors have accused the brokerage's management and two of
its brokers with failing to warn them fully of the risks of the
transactions. The settlement cancels all customer claims against
the brokerage and its directors, including several lawsuits filed
outside of the bankruptcy court.
   Cyril Moscow, the court-appointed trustee, said he plans to
pursue the brokerage's owners and directors for additional damages.
   Attorneys for 41 of the customers said their clients had their
assets in Shaine accounts, totaling $5.8 million, frozen after the
brokerage's failure. With the settlement, those involved will have
their accounts unfrozen and will get some money back after the
settlement is paid, attorney L.R. Roegge said.
   The trading losses mounted as the 60 clients sold options in the
Standard &amp; Poor's 100 Index. The options, sold on the Chicago Board
Options Exchange, were sold ``naked,'' meaning the customers did
not own the underlying stocks for which they were selling options
to purchase.

<HEAD>Chase President Expects Rise In Non-Performing Real Estate Loans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chase Manhattan Corp. President Thomas Labrecque
said Tuesday he expects to see a steady increase in problem real
estate loans over the next several months as sluggishness in many
commercial and residential markets continues.
   ``We had expected a cyclical market downswing for two years,''
Labrecque told a meeting of securities analysts. ``We took steps to
limit our growth and tighten our underwriting and appraisal
standards.''
   Chase placed $783 million in domestic real estate loans on a
nonaccrual basis at the end of 1989, a 49 percent jump from the
$527 million the previous year.
   When loans are placed on nonaccrual status, banks no longer
include on their statements the interest and other charges due on
the loans until the money is actually received.
   As the current sluggish real estate environment persists,
Labrecque said, the number of these non-performing loans is
expected to increase moderately in the first quarter and ``somewhat
more over the next quarters.''
   Chase's domestic real estate loan portfolio totaled $9 billion
at yearend, up from $7.1 billion in 1988.
   Despite the sharp rise in problem loans, Labrecque told analysts
overall credit quality in the bank's real estate lending business
was relatively good and should remain profitable.
   ``Our's is a well-diversified portfolio that has helped us
withstand regional downturns,'' he said.
   Chase is the nation's second-largest bank holding company with
assets of $107.37 billion at the end of 1989. Its individual bank,
in which its real estate lending operations are included, accounts
for around a third of total assets.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
higher Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade after see-sawing
through the session as traders searched for significant new
developments.
   The markets extended the strong gains posted in the previous
session, rallying near the close amid reports that the Soviet Union
was making progress on resolving credit problems.
   The reports stirred speculation that the Soviets would soon
return to the U.S. grain markets. Recent rumors of Soviet interest
in buying U.S. grain have so far not been confirmed by purchases.
   The wheat market found additional support in indications of
tight supplies for delivery against the March wheat contract, which
expires Wednesday. Other grain and soybean futures for March
delivery also go off the board Wednesday.
   At the close, wheat futures, were \ cent to 3} cents higher with
the contract for delivery in March at $4.02\ a bushel; corn futures
were \ cent to 2\ cents higher with March at $2.52\ a bushel; oats

<TEXT>
   A long-awaited increase in a key lending rate
Tuesday provided no quick fix for the sinking Japanese stock market
and weakening yen, but analysts predicted the move would have a
greater impact over the long term.
   The Bank of Japan raised its discount rate _ the interest
charged on loans to commercial banks _ by 1 percentage point to
5.25 percent. The increase was the fourth since last May, when the
rate stood at 2.5 percent.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index, which has been slumping
this year due to uncertainty over interest rates, continued to fall
in reaction to the rate hike, dropping 456.05 points, or 1.48
percent, to close at 30,807.19. It was the Nikkei's lowest closing
since 30,678.39 on Jan. 9, 1989.
   That followed a decline of 1,353.20 points, or 4.15 percent, on
Monday, the index's third-largest single-day fall.
   In another move aimed at supporting the stock market, major
Japanese securities houses reportedly agreed to suspend the
issuance of new shares. Nikkei Telecom, a Japanese news wire
service, reported the suspension would last at least a month.
   In the currency markets, the yen weakened further despite the
discount rate hike. Although higher rates tend to make a country's
currency more attractive, analysts said traders discounted the move
because they had been expecting it.
   The dollar gained 0.10 yen Tuesday, closing at 153.65 yen, its
highest since the March 12, 1987 closing of 153.69 yen.
   The yen's failure to respond to the discount rate hike
discouraged stock investors, who view currency stability as a key
to a recovery in stocks, traders said.
   Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno said Tuesday the bank's
move was ``pre-emptive,'' to maintain price stability, and would
not appreciably slow economic growth.
   While not providing an instant remedy, the rate increase would
help both the yen and the stock market in the long run, he said.
   Hiroshi Saito, president of Nippon Steel Corp., told Kyodo News
Service that the action would stabilize financial markets by making
investors think the interest rate has reached its top.
   But Hideo Mori, president of Sumitomo Chemical Co., said the
rate increase might damage healthy economic growth.
   Some analysts suggested the Bank of Japan waited too long to
raise the rate.
   ``If the discount rate had been raised when the dollar was about
to surpass the 150-yen line, the dollar could not have risen this
high,'' said Toshiaki Kakimoto, chief economist with Sumitomo Bank.
``Monetary actions should be taken in more flexible fashion.''
   With signs of inflationary pressure growing, the market had
expected the rise to come shortly after the Feb. 18 general
elections.
   Amid the uncertainty that followed, stock and bond prices and
the yen all continued to weaken.
   So far this year, the dollar has risen by more than 10 yen, or 7
percent, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's 225-share Nikkei Stock
Average has fallen more than 8,100 points, or almost 21 percent.
   This triple decline _ yen, stocks and bonds _ led companies to
shift money from stock and bond investments to bank accounts and
forced many to abandon plans for raising capital.
   Kakimoto said the rate increase would show its effects slowly
but surely, and would give the yen a chance for a gradual recovery.
   Since the interest rate gap between the United States and Japan
has narrowed, reducing the relatively higher returns on U.S.
securities, dollar-buying should slow, he said.
   Also, direct investments in the United States _ in factories,
real estate and takeovers _ may slow because dollars will become
more expensive for Japanese businessmen, Kakimoto said.

<HEAD>Americans Are Told To Eat Their Vegetables _ For A Day</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Not everyone noticed, but Tuesday was the Great American
Meatout, a day when soup kitchens went vegetarian in Pittsburgh and
the mayor of Des Moines, Iowa, discovered a new kind of pork barrel
politics.
   ``You're not my mayor,'' was among the kinder remarks greeting
Des Moines Mayor John ``Pat'' Dorrian at the Iowa statehouse after
he signed a proclamation recognizing the vegetarian holiday.
   ``This blows my mind,'' added Dorrian's non-constituent, state
Sen. John Soorholtz.
   Dorrian half-heartedly defended his decision to support a
one-day meat boycott in the nation's top pork-producing state, but
even he conceded, ``It's probably something that should never have
been signed.''
   The Meatout was the idea of the Farm Animal Reform Movement, a
national advocacy group opposed to ``factory farming'' and in favor
of vegeterian diets. It was intended as a response to National Meat
Week _ another of the nation's lesser-known commemorations.
   The Meatout was supported by such entertainment figures as Doris
Day, Ally Sheedy and River Phoenix, and ``American Top 40'' radio
announcer Casey Kasem.
   It also was observed, perhaps inadvertently, by about 500 people
who ate vegetarian meals at three soup kitchens in the Pittsburgh
area. The food was donated and served by volunteers from Animal
Advocates and the Pittsburgh Vegetarian Society.
   About 165 people ate vegetarian chili, corn, fruit cocktail and
bread at the Rainbow Kitchen in Homestead, a depressed former steel
town just outside of Pittsburgh.
   ``They liked it. We do serve vegetarian meals from time to
time,'' said Kevin Amos, the kitchen's food program manager.
   It was somewhat less of a success in Philadelphia _ birthplace
of freedom and the cheesesteak _ where Meatout supporters targeted
Jim's Steaks on South Street as their staging ground.
   A group of high school vegetarians stood outside the art deco
landmark passing out anti-meat fliers, carrots and orange slices as
the aroma of seared beef and fried onions wafted overhead.
   But they were evidently unable to cow any of the early lunch
crowd into avoiding meat for a day. The usual stampede began
shortly after 11 a.m.
   ``If they don't want to eat it, they don't have to,'' said Leon
Schwartz, a 30-year-old Philadelphian ``weaned'' on the famed
cheesesteak, a mound of sliced beef slathered with melted cheese
served on a roll. ``I want to, and I eat it. That's what America is
all about.''
   ``What is this, save a cow?'' said Bernie Bartholome, a New York
businessman as he chewed on a cheesesteak laden with peppers,
onions and tomatoes. ``See _ I eat vegetables, too.''
   Many passersby accepted the handout from the students and
chomped on the carrots.
   ``As long as they read it and understand, that's a start,'' said
Rachel Randolph, 15. ``People are being real receptive.''
   ``This is a Philadelphia institution, so we decided to stand
here,'' said Laura Kuperman, 16. ``We're trying to be friendly, not
confrontational.''
   What's their beef?
   The demonstrators said raising livestock is environmentally
dangerous, wastes vital farmland and is cruel to animals.
   It's also bad for you, they said, reciting statistics about
heart disease, saturated fat, cancer, hormones and other
uncomfortable topics.
   ``Even if they don't convert, their eyes will be open,'' said
Jane Edelstein, 15.
   ``We're trying to make people more aware,'' added Alix
Hetherington, 16.
   Anything more, presumably, would be gravy.

   Still, Wall Street's decline wasn't nearly as severe as the
sharp dive today in the Tokyo stock market. Analysts said the New
York market drew some support from strong bond prices, which pushed
interest rates lower.
   In Tokyo, the key Japanese stock index tumbled a second day as
neither currency market intervention nor an interest rate boost by
the central bank stopped the weakening of the Japanese yen.
   The Bank of Japan raised its key discount rate by 1 percentage
point to 5.25 percent. It was the fourth hike of a series intended
primarily to fight inflation.
   Hugh Johnson, senior vice president of First Albany Corp. in
Albany, N.Y., suggested that the Japanese may have to increase the
rate again in the near future.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which plunged 1,353.20
points, or 4.15 percent, on Monday in its third-largest single-day
fall, tumbled another 456.05 points, or 1.48 percent, today.
   The New York market had tumbled initially Monday in the wake of
that day's slide in Japan, but later recovered in an afternoon
rally.
   The Dow Jones average finished 14.41 points higher Monday at
2,755.63, its highest close since it stood at 2,760.67 on Jan. 11.

<HEAD>Britain Presents Cautious Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government, in growing trouble over the
economy, presented a cautious budget Tuesday aimed at fighting
inflation partly by encouraging Britons to save and hiking taxes on
tobacco, alcohol and gasoline.
   In his annual spring budget statement to the House of Commons,
Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major said the government would
raise an addition 500 million pounds, or $805 million, from
taxpayers in the year ended March 31, 1991.
   But he announced no drastic changes in the way the government
raises its tax revenue, choosing instead to tinker with thresholds
and allowances.
   His budget was expected to be highly popular with Britons who
will benefit from the adjustments, mainly small savers, retirees,
working mothers, and small businessmen.
   However, economists expressed disappointment in the statement,
saying it was not austere enough to curb 7.7 percent inflation,
which has been stubborn despite 15 percent interest rates.
   A tight budget would have increased tax revenue more than 3
billion pounds, and that would have been more effective in curbing
consumers' spending power, the economists said.
   The financial markets had little reaction. Opposition Labor
party leader Neil Kinnock called it a ``bits and pieces'' budget
that ``won't save the government.''
   This budget has been viewed as politically crucial for Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, whose economic strategy has come under
increasing fire. She needs to get the economy in the best possible
shape before mid-1992, the deadline for the next election.
   The spring statement, in addition to outlining the government's
revenue raising plans, is a principal platform for announcing
economic policies and forecasts.
   The government, which announces its spending plans in an autumn
statement, said in November it would spend 179 billion pounds in
the coming year. The Treasury said a figure for total tax revenue
was not available but that overall government receipts are expected
to come to 219 billion pounds.
   Major announced new special savings accounts which will allow
Britons to earn interest tax-free on up to 1,800 pounds a year for
five years if they leave the capital unchanged during the entire
period.
   The rises in excise taxes on gasoline, alcohol and tobacco were
roughly in line with inflation, Major said. For example, a
one-pound pint of beer will cost 2 pence more and a 1.60-pound pack
of cigarettes will cost 10 pence more.
   The chancellor left Britain's two income tax rates of 25 percent
and 40 percent unchanged. He reaffirmed the government's intention
to bring the basic rate down to 20 percent, but did not say when.
The corporate tax rate remains at 35 percent.
   ``This budget will take no risks with inflation,'' Major said.
``That beyond any doubt is the most urgent program before us
today.''
   Evelyn Brodie, senior British economist at the London investment
firm Morgan Grenfell and Co. said the chancellor ``hasn't tightened
policy at all.''
   ``If you were bearish before, you're still bearish now,'' said
Chris Dillow, an economist at Nomura Research Institute in London.
``We believe that the U.K.'s problems still remain.''
   Major said British inflation was worse than in other countries
because of heavy borrowing and strong consumer spending, but
insisted the government's strategy of raising interest rates was
working.
   ``It will worsen noticeably before it improves,'' he warned.
   He did not forecast the inflation rate's peak, which many
economists are pegging at 9 percent. He said the rate might still
be above 7 percent in the fourth quarter compared with the 5.75
percent he previously forecast, but that it should fall below 5
percent in 1991.
   ``My judgment is that interest rates will stay high for some
time to come,'' he said. Later, at a news conference, he said he
could not be certain interest rates wouldn't go up again.
   Britain's economy should grow 1 percent this year, and reach
2.75 percent in 1991, he said in Parliament. Growth was 2.5 percent
last year and 4.4 percent in 1988.
   The trade deficit should shrink to 15 million pounds this year,
and further thereafter, from more than 20 billion pounds last year,
Major said.

   The dollar rocketed higher in heavy trading
Tuesday, benefiting from profit-taking in West German marks and in
the Japanese yen.
   Intervention by several central banks aimed at shoring up the
sagging yen failed to alter the dollar's course. The banks
reportedly sold dollars on world foreign exchange markets and
bought yen.
   Speculation that U.S. interest rates would not decline soon,
which grew when the government reported an unexpectedly strong
inflation reading for February, also encouraged dollar buying.
   Gold prices tumbled. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a
bid of $392.40 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EST, down
$8.40 from Monday's late bid. On New York's Commodity Exchange,
gold for March delivery settled at $392.20 a troy ounce, $8.50 ower
than Monday.
   Currency dealers in the United States described trading in
dollars as brisk. They said the Federal Reserve sold dollars
against the yen, following similar maneuvers by its foreign
counterparts in Europe.
   ``We had a nice rally in the dollar,'' said John McCarthy, chief
dealer at the Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank's office in New York.
   McCarthy said most of the momentum for the dollar's broad
advance came from sales of West German marks to collect profits
amassed during the currency's recent climb.
   Traders had scrambled to buy marks ahead of Sunday's Eas German
elections and bought more Monday when the results indicated a
faster move toward a unified Germany. But as the euphoria over the
outcome of the voting eased, traders lightened their mark holdings.
   As trading ended in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.7048
West German marks, up from 1.6860 marks late Monday.
   The Japanese yen suffered despite an increase in a key lending
rate. Dealers said the 1 percentage point hike in Japan's discount
rate to 5.25 percent failed to evoke a favorable response because
the move was widely anticipated.
   The rate increase failed to snap the Tokyo stock market out of
its slump, further undermining the yen.
   One dollar bought 154.20 Japanese yen late in New York, more
than 153.05 yen late Monday. Earlier, in Tokyo, the dollar rose to
a closing 153.65 yen from 153.55 yen at Monday's close. Later, in
London, it rose to 153.85 yen.
   A slightly larger than expected increase in the February
Consumer Price Index and a widening in the U.S. merchandise trade
deficit during January were bullish for the dollar. The CPI rose
0.5 percent and the trade gap grew to $9.3 billion from $7.7
billion in December.
   The British pound reacted negatively to the annual budget
announcement delivered by Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major.
But dealers said the budget wouldn't have a lasting impact on
sterling and was considered neutral.
   One pound fetched $1.6005 late in New York, weaker than $1.6135
on Monday. Earlier in London, the British pound fell to $1.6105
from $1.6110 late Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late quotes
Monday, included: 1.5225 Swiss francs, up from 1.5085; 5.7575
French francs, up from 5.7025; 1,258.00 Italian lire, up from
1,246.75; and 1.17765 Canadian dollars, down from 1.18225.
   Selected dollar rates late in Europe compared with Monday's late
levels were: 1.6965 West German marks, up from 1.6829; 1.5157 Swiss
francs, up from 1.5085; 5.7340 French francs, up from 5.6895;
1.9107 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8970; 1,253.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,244.25; and 1.1792 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1836.
   Precious metals dealers said gold dropped in response to the
dollar's rise.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid of $398 a troy ounce from
$402.45 late Monday. In Zurich, the metal fell to a closing bid of
$399.25 from $402.50 late Monday. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell
$1.28 to close at a bid of $400.76.
   In New York, silver bullion for March delivery closed at $5.043
a troy ounce, down from Monday's settlement of $5.10. Silver
bullion fell in London to a late bid price of $5.09 a troy ounce
from $5.13 bid late Monday.

<HEAD>Gold Futures Prices Tumble On Dollar's Strength, Japanese Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices skidded well below $400 an ounce Tuesday on
New York's Commodity Exchange as a stronger dollar and a rise in
Japanese interest rates prompted aggressive selling of gold by
banks and Far Eastern investors.
   On other commodity markets, coffee futures surged; livestock and
meat futures retreated; energy futures were mixed; and grains and
soybeans were mostly higher.
   Gold futures settled $8.60 to $9.60 lower with the contract for
delivery in April at $393.30 a troy ounce, a four-month low.
   Silver futures finished 5.8 cents to 7.7 cents lower on the
Commodity Exchange with March at $5.043 a troy ounce; platinum
futures dropped $8.50 to $8.70 on the New York Mercantile Exchange
with April at $493.60 a troy ounce.
   Analysts said the gold market mainly took its cues from the
dollar, which surged in value Tuesday against the British pound,
Swiss franc, West German mark and the Japanese yen.
   A stronger dollar tends to discourage foreign demand for gold
because it makes the metal, which is traded in dollars, more
expensive in terms of other currencies.
   Further selling was prompted by the Bank of Japan's announcement
of a 1 point increase in its discount rate to 5.25 percent, the
fourth rate hike in a series intended to fight inflation.
   Tuesday's developments created uncertainty about the future of
Japanese investment demand for gold, said Stephen W. Platt, metals
analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   He said investment buying from Japan ``has been a big mover for
the market and there are questions as to whether it will still be
as formidable a source of demand as it has been.''
   Coffee futures rallied strongly on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp;
Cocoa Exchange, erasing nearly half of the steep losses registered
in the two previous sessions.
   Analysts tied the buying to perceptions that the market had sold
off too sharply in reaction to the Brazilian economic reforms
announced Friday. Traders initially speculated the reforms would
spur sales of coffee from Brazil, the world's largest producer, but
doubts about that prediction have surfaced.
   Coffee futures finished 1 cent to 3.52 cents higher with May at
91.21 cents a pound. The March contract expired at 88.46 cents a
pound.
   Cattle futures fell sharply on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
in selling prompted by softer cash markets. Weak cash prices also
pressured pork futures.
   Live cattle futures settled .50 cent to 1.33 cents lower with
April at 76.82 cents pound; feeder cattle were .40 cent to .87 cent
lower with March at 82.20 cents a pound; live hogs were .47 cent
lower to .05 cent higher with April at 53.25 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were unchanged to .85 cent lower with March at 50.60
cents a pound.
   Crude oil futures slipped while refined products advanced on the
New York Mercantile Exchange ahead of the American Petroleum
Institute's weekly inventory report.
   The report, released after the close, showed
smaller-than-expected U.S. supplies of crude oil and petroleum
distillates _ including heating oil _ while supplies of gasoline
were within market expectations.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures finished 9 cents to 32
cents lower with April at $19.28 a barrel; heating oil was .15 cent
to .33 lower with April at 54.35 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was .25 cent to .95 cent higher with April at 57.31 cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures settled mostly higher on the Chicago
Board of Trade after see-sawing through the session as traders
searched for significant new developments.
   Wheat futures finished { cent to 3} cents higher with March at
$4.02\ a bushel; corn futures were { cent to 2{ cents higher with
March at $2.53 a bushel; oats were { cent to 2 cents lower with
March at $1.46{ a bushel; soybeans were 1{ cent to 3 cents higher
with March at $5.92{ a bushel.

<TEXT>
   Foreign companies would have to pay more taxes
on profitable operations in the United States under a bill
introduced Tuesday by senior House Democrats.
   ``It is critical that we ensure that foreign-owned companies are
not underpaying their taxes, thereby gaining a competitive
advantage over American companies that are paying their fair share
of taxes,'' Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee, said at a news conference.
   The bill, also sponsored by House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo., grew out of Internal Revenue Service disclosures
that more than half of 36,800 foreign companies that filed tax
returns in 1986 reported no taxable income. The IRS is
investigating whether foreign companies underpaid taxes by billions
of dollars in the 1980s.
   Foreign-controlled corporations reported $542 billion in
receipts and $1.5 billion in losses and paid $3 billion in U.S.
income taxes in 1986. Gephardt said foreign automobile
manufacturers had $7.7 billion in sales and paid less than $12
million in tax.
   ``No wonder ... (U.S. automakers) have had a hard time
competing,'' Gephardt said.
   Gephardt and Rostenkowski said they are not worried that
enactment of their bill would discourage foreign investment, which
has played a major role in financing the U.S. budget deficit. ``All
we are asking people to do is pay what Americans pay to do business
in this country,'' Rostenkowski said.
   The bill would:
   _Expand IRS authority to investigate whether foreign companies
have manipulated U.S. tax laws in dealings with their American
subsidiaries and operating arms. For example, a foreign automaker
could artificially inflate the price of parts coming into the
United States so as to show little or no profit on the sale of the
completed car.
   A 1989 law strengthened the hand of the IRS by requiring
increased reporting and better recordkeeping by foreign companies,
but it does not apply to past-year taxes. The bill would allow the
IRS to use the stricter rules in investigating past-year problems.
   _Tax the capital gains realized when a foreigner sells stock in
a U.S. corporation. The tax would not apply to residents of
countries with which the United States has treaties prohibiting
such taxation.
   Congressional analysts estimate the bill would boost taxes on
foreign corporations and investors by about $200 million a year.
Gephardt said other estimates are far higher.

   Gasoline futures rebounded Tuesday while crude
oil prices continued to sag, pressured by concern about short-term
plentiful supplies and slowing demand.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the April contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, tumbled
32 cents to settle at $19.28 a 42-gallon barrel after trading as
low as $19.07.
   Analysts said a late round of arbitrage buying helped lift the
contract off its lows on the final day of trading before it expired.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for April delivery, which dropped
0.60 cents in Monday's session, rose 0.95 cent to 57.31 cents a
gallon.
   And the April contract for No. 2 heating oil, which rose 0.08
cent in the previous session, slipped 0.19 cent to 54.35 cents a
gallon.
   Energy analysts said crude oil started the day higher but gave
way to fundamental factors as the session progressed.
   Demand has slowed in recent weeks due mainly to seasonal factors
while production, particularly by OPEC countries, has remained
strong. Projections are for demand to continue to slow in the
second quarter, which is traditionally a period of weak demand.
   Analysts said the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries'
inaction at last weekend's monitoring committee meeting left the
market under pressure.
   OPEC ministers adjourned a two-day session without making any
new commitments to curb production, which currently exceeds demand
by more than a million barrels a day, according to various
estimates.

<TEXT>
   The nation's best-known matzo maker, B.
Manischewitz Co., was accused Tuesday of scheming with its
competitors to fix the price of $25 million of kosher Passover
matzo from 1981 to 1986.
   An indictment filed by the U.S. Justice Department in federal
court here accused the Jersey City-based company of conspiracy to
restrain trade. No other company was named, nor were any
individuals charged.
   The 101-year-old maker of kosher products issued a statement
denying the charge and said its prices have been ``independently
and fairly determined.''
   ``Manischewitz will vigorously defend against the charges,''
said the company. Questions were referred to vice president Robert
A. Mann.
   A secretary said Mann was out of the office until Wednesday and
that the company would have no other comment.
   Kosher for Passover matzo is made specially for the Jewish
holiday that celebrates the exodus of the Jews from ancient Egypt.
   The indictment, filed by the Justice Department's antitrust
division, alleged that Manischewitz and co-conspirators discussed
price increases and published price lists incorporating the
agreed-on increases.
   Customers who were charged the allegedly fixed prices included
kosher food distributors who sold to supermarket chains and grocery
stores.
   The maximum penalty for the charge is a $1 million fine.
   Manischewitz earned $286,861 on $32.5 million in sales in the
fiscal year ending July 31, 1989. The annual report said an 8.1
percent increase in sales resulted from higher average selling
prices, plus modest volume increases.
   The company has about 225 employees.
   At Streit's Matzos in New York City, a Manischewitz competitor,
a man who answered the phone and also declined to give his name
said company officials who could comment had left for the day late
Tuesday afternoon.
   The office manager at Goodman's Matzoh Inc. in Elmwood Park, who
declined to give her name, said Manischewitz has taken over its
matzo production.

   International Business Machines Corp. introduced
six new personal computers Tuesday that allow quick transfer of
information among a network of microcomputers.
   The machines, which include new versions of IBM's Model 80 plus
a new machine called the Model 65 SX, are IBM's first workstations
or file servers based on jazzed-up personal computers. Analysts
said they will enable the computer giant to catch up with the rest
of the personal computer market in that field. IBM had not
introduced a new top-end Model 80 since 1987.
   File servers are computers that can quickly disperse individual
files to a number of other computers. in contrast to a stand-alone
computer that does not have such capability.
   IBM already makes larger computers that can be used as file
servers for networks of machines.
   The new Personal System-2(a) models are variations of IBM's
Personal System-2 desktop computer line, offer twice as much memory
as earlier Model 60s and 80s and include high-performance fixed
disks as standard equipment.
   Four of the new machines are based on versions of Intel Corp.'s
80386-series microprocessor. A new system, the IBM Personal
System-2 Model 65 SX, is designed around the Intel 80386SX
microprocessor.
   All are equipped with microchannel card adapters called Small
Computer System Interface that will enable the user to attach up to
seven devices such as printers, disk drives or optical scanners
through a single system expansion slot. Previous adapters allowed
only one hookup.
   ``They are as good as the competition but I wouldn't say they're
any sort of showstopper,'' said Daniel C. Benton, computer analyst
with Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.
   Two of the machines run at 25-megahertz and include a 64
kilobyte memory cache and four megabytes of random access memory.
Two others run at 20-megahertz and come equipped with two megabytes
of RAM and either 120 megabytes or 320 megabytes of hard disk
capacity.
   Two versions of the Model 65 SX come with a two megabyte memory
and either 60 megabytes or 120 megabytes of hard disk capacity.
   Companies increasingly have been hooking together their personal
computers so employees can share a data base. That allows workers
to access and update the same documents or to share computer files
electronically rather than by transferring computer disks manually
from one machine to another.
   File servers function as the central data repository for a
network of personal computers. They have a much greater storage
capacity and can get at data more quickly than an ordinary desktop
computer.
   But the capabilities of a file server are as much a function of
the hardware as the software, the program that runs the computer,
said Peter Burris, an analyst with the consulting firm
International Data Group.
   IBM's chief competitor in the personal computer file server
business will be Compaq Computer Corp., which last fall introduced
machines that analysts considered impressive. Compaq makes
IBM-compatible computers.
   The four Model 80s are priced between $7,495 and $13,195 and the
Model 65 SX machines at $5,295 and $5,995.
   IBM also announced price reductions between 15 percent and 24
percent on all existing PS-2 Model 80s, Model 60s, Model 30-001s
and Model 30-021s.
   For example, the Model 80-071 has been reduced to $6,095 from
$7,995 and the Model 30-021 has been marked down to $1,925 from
$2,255.
   Other new devices announced by IBM include a new IBM PS-2
laserprinter Model P70 386-031 that is 25 percent faster than the
current industry leader made by Hewlett Packard. The laserprinter
with color display is also competitively priced with the HP printer
at $1,495.

   Smith Corona Corp., citing a market
shift to lower priced electronic products, has cut 350 positions at

   The company said it would offset the Cortland layoffs by adding

transition to our new product line which will be introduced this
summer.''
   Thompson said the demand for higher priced products, such as
those produced at the Cortland facility, has weakened and the
demand for the cheaper products has increased.
   The New Canaan-based company manufactures portable electronic
typewriters and personal word processors. It also markets office
supplies including file folders, office forms and paper.

<HEAD>Outboard Marine To Acquire Grunman Boats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WAUKEGAN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Outboard Marine Corp. said Tuesday it was
acquiring Grumman Allied Industries' boat manufacturing plants and
equipment in three states.
   Under terms of the agreement, Outboard Marine would take over
Grumman Boats plants in Marathon, N.Y., Arkadelphia, Ark., and
Minong, Wis. Grumman Boats is a division of Grumman Allied
Industries Inc., a subsidiary of Grumman Corp.
   Outboard Marine also would obtain all current inventory of
Grumman Boats and the exclusive license to use the Grumman name on
a worldwide basis to market aluminum recreational boats.
   The company did not provide financial details on the agreement.
   ``This acquisition provides us with additional manufacturing
capacity for aluminum boats in the northeastern and southern
regions of the country,'' said James C. Chapman, Outboard Marine
president and chief executive officer.
   ``It also gives us another brand of outboard powered aluminum
boats to satisfy demand for these products among our Johnson and
Evinrude outboard motor dealers,'' Chapman said in a statement.
   Outboard Marine manufactures and sells boats, marine engines
marine accessories and services. It currently markets Lowe, Sea
Nymph and Suncruiser aluminum boats in the U.S., along with eight
brands of fiberglass boats.
   Outboard Marine had net sales in 1989 of $1.5 billion.

<HEAD>Union Accuses American Airlines of Asking for FAA Scrutiny</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pilots union said American Airlines' request
that federal regulators monitor its flight crews is raising tension
between the two sides.
   The Allied Pilots Association, which represents the 8,100 pilots
at American, said the airline asked the Federal Aviation
Administration to monitor its flights in order to determine if
pilots are slowing down.
   A federal mediator is scheduled next week to join contract talks
between American and the pilots, which started last September.
   In a letter to U.S. Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, APA
President Fred Vogel said FAA monitoring violates the Bush
administration's policy of not intervening in labor disputes.
   Vogel's letter contained what he said was an FAA memo advising
air traffic controllers to keep a record of American's flights.
   ``It appears that some flight crews are flying their aircraft at
less-than- expected altitudes and speeds. American Airlines has
asked, to the extent possible, that we record the flight call
signs, dates and times for forwarding to the airline,'' the FAA
memo said, according to Vogel.
   Vogel warned Skinner that the FAA will bear some responsibility
if negotiations break down and pilots strike American, the nation's
largest airline.
   The letter asks Skinner to ``take the necessary steps'' to stop
the FAA monitoring.
   The pilots union referred questions about details of its request
to Scott Peterson, who did not immediately return a call Tuesday.
   Al Becker, a spokesman for Fort Worth-based American, said the
airline has seen ``absolutely no evidence of a systematic
slowdown.''
   A DOT spokesman said Monday it was a common practice for air
traffic controllers to closely monitor airlines that are locked in
tough contract talks with their pilots.
   But, he added, ``During these types of negotiations, it's not
uncommon for individual pilots to conduct themselves in a way that
is not in the best interest of the company.''
   To slow down flights, pilots can fly and taxi at
slower-than-normal speeds and cancel flights because of minor
mechanical problems.

<TEXT>
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. on Tuesday downgraded
Greyhound Lines Inc.'s credit rating, citing a 20-day-old drivers
strike and a $380 million debt from a 1987 leveraged buyout.
   Standard &amp; Poor's, a credit rating agency, said the company's
new management has improved revenue generation and operating
efficiency, but interest on the debt and rentals on leased buses
remain a heavy burden.
   It also said the strike by unionized drivers that began March 2
``initially halted most bus operations and has caused substantial
losses.''
   Standard &amp; Poor's said it had lowered Greyhound's rating to
B-from B. It said the company remained on its CreditWatch list
pending a further review.
   George Gravley, a spokesman for Dallas-based Greyhound, said:
``We don't have anything to say about that. We have a good
financial condition, and we're not at all concerned.''
   Meanwhile, the company and the drivers union, Amalgamated
Council of Greyhound Local Unions, said there was no movement
toward reopening contract talks that stalled Sunday.
   Each has accused the other of not negotiating in good faith.
   Unions representing 6,300 drivers and an estimated 3,000 other
Greyhound workers walked out over wages, job security and grievance
procedures.
   A Greyhound spokeswoman Monday said the proposal union leaders
offered Saturday was ``three times more than Greyhound could
afford.''
   A union spokesman said the company has offered a plan that
included no guaranteed pay raises, but would have made raises
contingent on increased profits and ridership.
   During the strike, there have been at least 14 shooting attacks
on Greyhound buses, 46 bomb threats and numerous other incidents of
vandalism or threats during the walkout, company officials say.
   Greyhound operates the only nationwide intercity bus service.

<BYLINE>Anheuser-Busch Launches New Attack Against Miller</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anheuser-Busch Inc., the world's largest
brewer, announced a new product Tuesday that looks and sounds a lot
like the popular, cold-filtered beer made by rival Miller Brewing
Co.
   The new beer, called Busch Cold Filtered Draft, will be sold in
clear, longneck bottles just like Miller's Genuine Cold Filtered
Draft.
   ``Imitation is nothing new for Anheuser-Busch,'' said Susan
Henderson, a spokeswoman for Milwaukee-based Miller. ``Miller
coined the term cold filtered in 1985 to describe its exclusive
non-heat pasteurization process and Anheuser-Busch wants to turn it
into a generic term.''
   Anheuser-Busch plans to test market the new beer for one to two
months in Tulsa, Okla. to determine whether it's a viable product.
   Michael Roarty, director of marketing for Anheuser-Busch, said
the company has wanted to use a clear bottle for some time, to
serve beer drinkers who like to see what they're drinking.
   Miller Genuine Draft, the fastest-growing premium beer in the
country, last year supplanted Anheuser-Busch's Michelob as the
nation's 10th most-popular beer.
   A big difference between the two beers is that Busch Cold
Filtered Draft is sensitive to light and could spoil if the bottles
are taken out of the box and left, for example, on a shelf or in a
tub of ice in the backyard.
   Anheuser-Busch hasn't sold beer in clear bottles for at least
100 years because beer made by its methods spoils when exposed to
light.
   Anheuser uses the entire hop blossom when it makes beer, while
Miller extracts the important oils and resins from the blossom
separately and adds them to the brew kettle.
   Miller's process protects the beer from taste-altering light,
Busch's does not. The two have had a long-running dispute over
their brewing processes.
   ``We really had a dilemma because we wanted to use a clear
bottle but we also wanted to continue our tradition of using only
natural ingredients,'' said Klaus Zastrow, brewmaster for
Anheuser-Busch.
   The company compromised by brewing Busch Cold Filtered Draft
with its usual methods while packaging the clear bottles in a
light-proof cardboard box. But once the beer comes out of the box
it's susceptible to spoilage, Zastrow said.
   ``If you're talking about a bright, sunny day, it could be a
matter of minutes before the beer develops this off-flavor,''
Zastrow said. ``If you're inside it could take hours.''
   Because of this uncertainty, Anheuser-Busch in its test
marketing initially will sell the beer only in restaurants and
taverns.
   Zastrow said some people may enjoy the light-induced change in
the taste.
   ``The exposure to light will enhance the hoppy flavor and the
beer will taste more European,'' said Zastrow.
   Anheuser Busch sells 17 other brands of beer including Busch and
Busch Light. The company uses a cold filtering process to make
Busch Light and Bud Dry, which is scheduled to be rolled out
nationally in two weeks.
   All beer is cold-filtered, but beer that advertises the ``cold
filtered process'' undergoes a second, highly pressurized
cold-filtering to remove yeast cells. That second process takes the
place of pasteurization.
   Stock analysts said the new beer offered the world's largest
brewery another opportunity to grow in an industry that has been
experiencing flat sales for several years.
   ``I guess you could call it copying, but in every business if
something is successful you're going to see people jump on the
bandwagon,'' said Bob Bernstein, a stock analyst for Edward D.
Jones Co. in St. Louis. ``Companies don't stand back and applaud
their competitor's success. They try to come up with something even
better.''

<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. and Saab-Scania AB have have
completed setting up a joint automaking venture in Europe, the
Swedish company said Tuesday.
   GM, the world's largest automaker, and Saab-Scania, Sweden's
second-biggest vehicle maker behind Volvo AB, agreed Dec. 15 to
form a joint automaking company, called Saab Automobile AB.
   Ownership of the new company is split 50-50 between Saab and GM,
which is spending about $600 million to acquire half of the
corporation's auto business.
   Saab-Scania's automobile business has been struggling
financially and draining profits from the corporation's other
businesses, including trucks and airplanes.
   The move is seen as a way to financially bolster the automotive
business and to give GM a manufacturing foothold in Sweden.
   The new company will manufacture and distribute cars under the
Saab nameplate through Saab's dealer network and make GM cars for
European distribution.

<HEAD>World Bank Holds Back Loan for China</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Bank on Tuesday held back a $150
million loan to China that was to go before representatives of the
152 member governments for approval, a bank spokesman said.
   A source familiar with the bank's work said World Bank President
Barber Conable decided on the move when it became apparent the loan
would not be approved.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady last week said he would
oppose loans by the bank to China that were not for basic human
needs. The proposed loan was earmarked for roads and inland ways in
Jiangsu province in east central China.
   Decisions on loans are made behind closed doors by the bank's 22
executive directors. The United States controls 19 percent of the
vote, the largest single block. Usually enough other governments
support the U.S. view for a majority.
   Conable last June withheld consideration of nearly $800 million
in loans to China after troops suppressed a pro-democracy movement.
He said his decision was made on economic grounds.
   President Bush, however, asked that loans be held up as part of
the U.S. sanctions against the Chinese goverrment.
   Last month the board approved two loans to China worth $90
million, including one that delayed in June. The Treasury
Department said the U.S. representative voted for the loans.
   At a Congressional hearing last week, Brady took note of
opposition to the loans by many members of Congress, and said the
U.S. position was taken on behalf of them as well as the Bush
administration.
   The bank is the largest single source of aid to the Third World,
making loans of more than $22 billion a year.
   Its charter, and those of other intergovernment banks that help
the Third World, try to prevent political matters from being
considered in granting loans.
   But Brady said the United States will insist that progress
toward democracy be made a condition for loans under the rules of
the projected European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
   Brady said he had made it clear to the Soviet Union that any
loans from the new bank to them would leave less for other east
European countries the United States considers further along on the
road to democracy. The World Bank does not lend to the Soviet
Union, which is not a member.

   The U.S. stock market showed resilience but
finished lower Tuesday in the face of negative economic reports and
another steep tumble on the Tokyo exchange.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 16.89 points to
2,738.74.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
892 down, 598 up and 495 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board totaled 177.32 million
shares, up from 142.30 million in Monday's session.
   After shrugging off negative economic news to rise early in the
session, stocks turned lower in the afternoon and lost most of the
ground just before the close. Wall Street has posted an impressive
advance in recent weeks.
   ``It was just an overbought market that got a little bit ahead
of itself,'' said Charles Jensen, an analyst at MKI Securities Corp.
   The government reported that consumer inflation was 0.5 percent
in February and the U.S. trade deficit worsened dramatically in
January, climbing to $9.3 billion.
   The January trade deficit was 20.5 percent larger than
December's $7.7 billion gap. Most of the deterioration came from a
44 percent surge in oil imports.
   Still, Wall Street's decline wasn't nearly as severe as the
sharp dive Tuesday in the Tokyo stock market. Analysts said the New
York market drew some support from strong bond prices, which pushed
U.S. interest rates lower.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond finished about ~
point higher, or up $8.75 for every $1,000 in face value. Its
yield, which falls when the price rises, slid to 8.45 percent from
8.53 percent late Monday.
   In Tokyo, the key Japanese stock index tumbled a second straight
day as neither currency market intervention nor an interest rate
boost by the central bank stopped the weakening of the Japanese yen.
   The Bank of Japan raised its key discount rate by 1 percentage
point to 5.25 percent. It was the fourth hike of a series intended
primarily to fight inflation.
   Hugh Johnson, senior vice president of First Albany Corp. in
Albany, N.Y., suggested that the Japanese may have to increase the
rate again in the near future.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which plunged 1,353.20
points, or 4.15 percent, on Monday in its third-largest single-day
fall, tumbled another 456.05 points, or 1.48 percent, Tuesday.
   The New York market had dropped initially Monday in the wake of
that day's slide in Japan, but later recovered in an afternoon
rally.
   The Dow Jones average finished 14.41 points higher Monday at
2,755.63, its highest close since it stood at 2,760.67 on Jan. 11.
   Among actively traded issues Tuesday on the NYSE, IBM fell 1 to
108, General Electric was down { at 64&rsqb;, Boeing dropped 1 to 70{
and AT&amp;T slipped | to 41}.
   Philip Morris was unchanged at 39, General Motors was up &lsqb; at
47| and Bank of New England rose ~ to 5&lsqb;.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 212.70 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $15.55 billion, or 0.47
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.95 to 187.71.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 2.35 to 396.45, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 1.96 at 341.57.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
2.83 to 440.08. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index lost 0.70 at 363.42.

<DATELINE>BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A delicatessan owner testified Tuesday
that Academy Award winner Paul Newman reneged on a promise of stock
in exchange for helping the actor launch his spaghetti sauce and
salad dressing business.
   Newman, dressed in a blue pinstripe suit and shiny black boots,
sat in the back of the courtroom, took notes and talked to a
business partner as testimony began in the second trial in the case.
   Westport deli owner Julius Gold sued Newman in 1983, claiming he
was promised stock in Newman's Own Inc. A mistrial was declared in
1988 when the jury mistakenly received depositions not admitted as
evidence.
   Newman and A.E. Hotchner, a friend and fellow Westport resident,
started Newman's Own to sell the salad dressing Newman had been
making and bottling for friends. The company, which also makes
popcorn and lemonade, donates all profits to charity, $28 million
so far.
   Gold, 65, testified that he received a call from Hotchner in
1979 asking for help in distributing the dressing to six or eight
stores in Westport.
   ``I did nothing immediately after that phone call, nor did I do
anything for a period of many months,'' Gold said, adding he had
doubts about the venture.
   But he said he got a second telephone call from Hotchner in
January 1980, and set Hotchner up with three distributors. The last
was David Kalman, who eventually distributed the products
nationwide.
   Gold also said he performed other services to help the business
and sat in on many meetings, including a May 1982 meeting with
Newman's attorney, Leo Nevas, at which he and Kalman were promised
8 percent of the stock.
   Newman winced when Gold testified said the actor offered him a
ride home in a Volkswagen after an August 1982 meeting at Newman's
New York apartment to discuss kickoff plans for the salad dressing.
Newman drives and races Nissans.
   At the end of the ride, Gold said he thanked Newman for giving
him 8 percent of the stock, and the actor said, ``That's fine,
you're very welcome.'' Newman shook his head.
   Gold, who is seeking unspecified damages, also claims he
performed other services to help with details such as packaging and
labeling. He was the first witness in the trial in Bridgeport
Superior Court.
   Newman's lawyer, W. Patrick Ryan, said he plans to produce
witnesses and evidence disputing Gold's claims.
   ``Nobody's saying he wasn't looking for stock. Of course he was
looking for stock,'' Ryan said in opening arguments Tuesday. ``The
only thing is, he was told no. He asked again, he was told no.''
   Security at Bridgeport Superior Court was tight. A television
camera and a still camera have been allowed in the courtroom, but
only to photograph the judge, witnesses and lawyers.
   During a break, Newman said a bandage on his right hand was for
an injury he got when his finger stuck in the collar of his dog,
Griggs. But he declined to discuss the lawsuit, saying, ``I don't
think it's appropriate at this time.''

   The Senate rejected efforts Tuesday night to
toughen auto pollution controls in a compromise clean air bill as
opponents successfully argued the provision was ``a prescription
for deadlock.''
   The vote was 52-46 to table, and in effect kill, an amendment
which would have required considerably tighter emissions controls
on automobiles than a compromise bill crafted by Senate leaders and
the White House. It also called for 1 million vehicles capable of
burning fuels other than gasoline toward the end of the decade.
   Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., and other backers of the amendment
argued that additional restrictions on automobile pollutants were
needed because autos ``are the biggest source of pollution in our
cities.''
   But Senate leaders and supporters of the compromise bill
characterized the tougher requirement as threatening enactment of
clean air legislation altogether this year because of the strong
opposition from the Bush administration.
   Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, called the amendments
``a prescription for deadlock'' on the bill before the Senate.
   ``Do we want 13 more years of speeches or do we want a bill? Do
we want to make statements or do we want to make law?'' Mitchell
asked his colleagues.
   Meanwhile, the compromise was under attack on another front
Tuesday in a dispute over whether the federal government should
provide assistance to coal miners who lose their jobs because of
the bill.
   Wirth said on the floor that the coal miner assistance proposal
``appears to have a majority of the votes.'' Negotiations have been
under way with the Bush administration to see if all parties could
agree on help for miners.
   The White House has objected to the plan's $700 million price
tag and has characterized it as a ``deal breaker'' if some
compromise cannot be reached with the sponsor, Sen. Robert C. Byrd,
D-W.Va.
   Deadlock on the Byrd amendment caused the Senate to turn its
attention to auto controls.
   Byrd is trying to help miners of high-sulfur coal who would lose
jobs because of new curbs of sulfur dioxide emissions by Midwest
utilities. His plan calls for four years of assistance to miners.
Byrd's state produces both high-sulfur and low-sulfur coal.
   Mitchell had refused Byrd's repeated calls to bring his
amendment to a vote.
   The amendment was to have been the first order of business when
the Senate reconvened after a week recess, but consideration was
postponed for a second time early Tuesday.
   Senate sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed
Wirth's assertion that Byrd appears to have enough votes for the
amendment. Senate leaders fear the amendment would prompt the White
House to withdraw support for the legislation and threaten passage
of a clean air bill this year.
   Some of Byrd's support may come from senators who oppose the
overall bill for various easons and see a push for coal miners'
assistance as a chance to stall the legislation, Senate and
industry and environmental lobbyists suggested Tuesday.
   Byrd met Monday with Roger Porter, President Bush's chief
domestic policy adviser, in an attempt to reach a compromise, but
sources said little progress was made.
   The Senate bill would set tough new pollution controls on
industry and automobiles to reduce urban smog, cut toxic chemical
emissions from industry, and require electric utilities to reduce
sulfur dioxide emissions by 10 million tons by the end of the
decade.
   Byrd says that provision, which is aimed at reducing acid rain,
would cost the jobs of thousands of coal miners, including many in
his state where many jobs depend on high-sulfur coal.
   Wirth noted in Tuesday's debate that President Bush said last
year the clean air bill should ``reconcile the automobile with the
environment.'' But Wirth said the compromise backs off from that
promise.
   In the House, meanwhile, the Energy and Commerce Committee edged
toward consideration the first of several amendments to a somewhat
different clean air bill.
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., introduced an amendment Tuesday
that would tighten controls on urban smog from industry.
   ``I don't think we're that far apart,'' said Waxman, suggesting
he's ready to compromise on the proposal and predicting a possible
vote within days. The committee, chaired by Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., hopes to push a clean air bill to the House floor by May.

   General Motors Corp. will delay moving production
of full-size vans to Flint from Scarborough, Ontario, for one year
to provide more time for retooling in Michigan, GM officials said
Tuesday.
   GM announced late last year it would make a series of moves in
late 1991 that would result in idling its Scarborough plant and a
production reduction at its truck factory in Lordstown, Ohio.
   The moves are designed to consolidate full-size van production
at GM's Flint truck plant. Full-size vans now are made at
Scarborough and Lordstown.
   GM of Canada spokesman Nick Hall said Tuesday that the
Scarborough plant would stay open through at least late 1992 and
continue making full-size vans. About 2,400 hourly and 300 salaried
employees work at the plant.
   GM Truck &amp; Bus Group spokeswoman Kari Hulsey said moves are
still planned for late 1991 that will transfer production of
Chevrolet Blazer and Suburban and GMC Jimmy vehicles from Flint to
Janesville, Wis., and production of full-size vans from Lordstown
to Flint.
   She said specific dates for the production changes have not been
set. About 2,500 Lordstown workers are to be laid off when the move
occurs.

   The case of Joseph Hazelwood went to
the jury Tuesday after a defense attorney called the Exxon Valdez
skipper a scapegoat of political powers and a prosecutor portrayed
him as a reckless drunk.
   A defense attorney argued that the 7-week-old trial was a
political action in which the state seeks to shift blame for the
disaster.
   ``Maybe the state hopes the people will look the other way when
it comes to their responsibility,'' defense attorney Dick Madson
declared in his final argument.
   Madson said crew members were not the only ones who saw that
Hazelwood wasn't impaired aboard the Exxon Valdez when it struck a
charted reef a year ago Saturday. He pointed to 21 witnesses at
Hazelwood's criminal trial who said the captain was sober and
showed no signs of being impaired by alcohol.
   Assistant District Attorney Brent Cole said it was not necessary
to show that Hazelwood looked intoxicated to have been impaired by
drink.
   ``The state has to prove he was under the influence of
intoxicating liquor,'' Cole said. He said this did not mean that
``a person is stumbling, falling down, and needs support.''
Instead, Cole argued, impairment means ``when your physicial and
mental abilities are impaired.''
   Cole asked jurors to determine that Hazelwood was impaired from
his actions and from a blood test taken 10{ hours after the ship
ripped its hull open on a reef in Prince William Sound.
   Following arguments, Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone
instructed jurors on the law for about an hour, then told them to
select a foreman and begin their deliberations.
   They spent about 10 minutes behind closed doors, then retired
for the day. They were to resume Wednesday morning.
   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., is charged with one felony,
criminal mischief, and three misdemeanors, reckless endangerment,
operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of
oil. If convicted, he could receive 7\ years in prison and $61,000
in fines.
   After the ship ran aground, it spilled nearly 11 million gallons
of Alaska North Slope crude oil, blackening hundreds of miles of
shoreline and killing fish, birds and other wildlife.
   Madson urged jurors to ignore efforts to make Hazelwood out as
the villain.
   ``Alaska is known as the last frontier,'' he said. ``We don't
have vigilantes or lynch mobs. What this frontier does is grant a
fair trial to everyone _ even people who transport what they call
black gold.
   ``Captain Hazelwood is entitled to that fairness,'' Madson said.
   He reminded jurors that their verdict cannot change or improve
what happened in Prince William Sound. ``That is over and done,''
Madson said.
   Many parties had an interest in seeing Hazelwood blamed for the
disaster, and among them might be Exxon itself, Madson said in
response to prosecution claims that Exxon wants the skipper
acquitted.
   Madson ridiculed any reliance on the delayed blood test. He said
the calculations presented by a prosecution expert on how drunk
Hazelwood might have been were hard to believe.
   ``Under the testimony you heard, Captain Hazelwood would have
had to be dragged up there (on the ship) by the collar. He would
have been so high at that blood alcohol level,'' Madson said.
   He held up a picture of the ship's precarious gangway, which the
skipper negotiated without a missed step, and declared, ``this is
probably the toughest sobriety test you're going to see.''
   Cole said crew members who testified that the captain was sober
were probably influenced by Exxon to back up the skipper.
   He asked the jury to notice ``the presence of Exxon in this
case,'' and recalled the testimony of an Exxon executive who said
the company has an interest in the outcome of Hazelwood's trial.
   ``It doesn't take a brain surgeon to see Exxon's interest in
this matter,'' Cole said. ``It's seeing Captain Hazelwood get
acquitted.''
   The prosecutor reminded jurors that crew members who testified
supported their captain on many issues, and sometimes changed the
stories they had originally given about the grounding of the Exxon
Valdez.
   Witnesses, for example, told the National Transportation Safety
Board that the skipper tried to move the ship off the reef, but
some said on the stand that they did not know if he was trying
while others said he was not, Cole contended.
   ``It's easy to see the pressure they (Exxon) were putting on
these crew members,'' said Cole as Exxon lawyers maintained their
daily front-row vigil.
   Exxon spokesman Joe Tucker in Anchorage said he was not
authorized to comment on Cole's allegations and that Exxon
officials in Houston were not available.
   Cole said Hazelwood risked his ship and the lives of his crew,
and should be found guilty of reckless conduct.
   Madson told jurors they could not ignore the testimony of the 21
people, not all Exxon employees, who said he was sober. He said
jurors could not discount the opinions of experts who said that, if
the skipper's instructions had been followed, the ship would have
missed Bligh Reef by two miles.
   Hazelwood sat calmly at the defense table. His wife and father,
who recently arrived at the trial, sat in back-row seats of the
crowded courtroom.
