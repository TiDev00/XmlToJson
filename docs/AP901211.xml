<HEAD>Three Convicted Of Conspiring To Buy Missile For IRA</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Three Irishmen were convicted
Tuesday of conspiring to buy a Stinger missile for the Irish
Republican Army after a trial that prompted criticism from jurors
of federal sting operations.
   Kevin McKinley of Riviera Beach, Seamus Moley of Toronto, and
Joseph McColgan of Dundalk, Ireland, were found guilty of two of
five charges in U.S. District Court.
   They were convicted of a conspiracy count that they attempted to
obtain military weapons to use against British forces in Northern
Ireland and attempting to obtain a Stinger surface-to-air missile.
   Each was acquitted of three remaining charges - attempting to
transport an explosive in foreign commerce, attempting to export
defense articles without a license and violating the Neutrality
Act.
   The men, who have been held without bond since January, each
face a maximum sentence of 15 years. Sentencing was set for Feb.
22, 1991.
   Jurors said they felt their hands were tied when U.S. District
Judge Jose Gonzalez ruled they could not consider entrapment as a
defense.
   ``It's a shame that the government spent tons of money to entrap
these three guys who really weren't looking for any trouble,'' said
juror Fabio Majia.
   Defense attorney Fred Haddad added, ``If the judge had allowed
them to consider entrapment, these men would be on their way to the
airport boarding a plane for Ireland right now.''
   The government's case was based on the trio's attempts to buy a
Stinger missile from undercover agents posing as arms dealers.
   The defendants claimed they were with the IRA and wanted to use
the Stinger to shoot down a British helicopter in Northern Ireland,
the government said.
   Federal agents showed them a realistic model of the Stinger to
see if they were serious about the deal. The missile had a genuine
infrared guidance system, but no rocket fuel or explosives in the
warhead.
   The defendants then produced $50,000 to buy the missile. Agents
arrested all three Jan. 12 in Palm Beach County after McColgan
placed the missile in a car so he could ride away with it.
   Robert J. Creighton, special agent in charge of the Miami
district for U.S. Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms, praised
the conviction.
   ``This will strike a significant blow against the Irish
Republican Army operations within the United States,'' he said.
   Defense attorneys argued during the month-long trial that
government destroyed key tape recordings, entrapped their clients
and used a ``psychopathic gun nut'' as an informant.
   Prosecutors warned jurors to set aside any personal feelings
about the historic conflict in Ireland and consider violations of
U.S. law.
   The IRA is fighting to drive the British out of Northern Ireland
and unite the Protestant-dominated province with the overwhelmingly
Roman Catholic Irish Republic under a leftist administration. More
than 2,800 people have been killed in political and sectarian
violence in the province since 1969.

<HEAD>Teen's Family Wins $1.2 Million in Abortion Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The family of a 13-year-old girl who died after
a failed abortion has received a $1.2 million jury award, the
largest wrongful-death abortion payment in state history.
   A Manhattan jury made its decision last Friday in the case of
Dawn Ravenell, who died in January 1985 after the abortion at the
Eastern Women's Center in Manhattan.
   The jury ruled that Dr. Allen Klein of Philadelphia and nurse
Robert Augente of East Williston, N.Y., were liable for $950,000 in
pecuniary damages, or loss of service to the family, and $275,000
for pain and suffering.
   The girl's parents, who are both Pentecostal ministers, did not
know their daughter was pregnant until they received word she was
in a coma on Jan. 24, 1985, said the girl's mother, Ruth Ravenell.
   ``I know that she was fearful in that we are a religious
family,'' said Mrs. Ravenell. ``I think that she felt that for me
to see her as less than perfect would have been too much.''
   According to court records, Ravenell was 21 weeks pregnant when
she went to the clinic for an abortion.
   Five minutes into the procedure, Ravenell came out of a general
anesthesia and began vomiting and choking, court papers said. The
doctor and nurse inserted a breathing tube and moved her to a
recovery room, where she began choking again, papers said.
   She then suffered a massive heart attack before the medical
personnel checked on her again, according to the records. She was
already in a coma when the ambulance arrived. She died three weeks
later at Roosevelt Hospital, never regaining consciousness.
   Nationally, six women died from abortions in 1985, according to
the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research
organization.
   Before Friday's award, the highest sum awarded in an abortion
death was $701,500 in the 1984 case of a 24-year-old Manhattan
woman, said Russell Moran, editor of Jury Verdict Reporter.

   Incredulous motorists who pull into U.T.
Brown's filling station might wonder if they hadn't taken the wrong
turn and wandered into an amusement park by mistake.
   The landscaping around Cardinal Plaza Shell's gasoline pumps
includes a Japanese rock garden with stone dragons and pagodas, a
five-foot fiberglass Ninja Turtle and a miniature putting green
surrounded by sand traps.
   To help his customers fill 'er up with the Christmas spirit,
Brown has scattered his gardens with nine welded-wire reindeer and
a sleigh, all blinking with hundreds of tiny white lights. And, of
course, a red-nosed Rudolph stands watch over his herd from a perch
above the garage.
   There's a 25-foot illuminated Christmas tree on the roof of the
gas pump bays, 500 red and white lamps bordering the immaculate
lawn, and a giant candy cane decorating the tire racks.
   A model train whistles as it clickety-clacks around a circular
track atop the cashier's booth throughout the day, to the delight
of small children.
   A tape of Bing Crosby crooning ``White Christmas'' is even piped
into the restrooms.
   Lest he forget his Jewish customers, Brown has installed a
lighted menorah in his window for Hanukkah, the eight-day festival
of lights that begins tonight.
   ``It's unbelievable. At nighttime it looks like Disneyland,''
said Brown, 58, who is proprietor of the station with his son,
Scott, 27.
   Both are graduates of the University of Virginia with degrees in
business administration but neither is a landscape gardener. As
self-taught amateurs, they have gladly invested a small fortune
creating a wonderland for their customers' enjoyment.
   It's been good for business, said the elder Brown, and it's been
a lot of fun. ``I like to do it, and the customers like it,'' he
said. ``My business takes so much out of the community that I like
to put something back in.''
   Brown's office wall is covered with Shell Oil Co. citations for
appearance and customer service. The Fairfax County Board of
Supervisors issued a special certificate praising Brown's
beautification efforts, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars gave him a
``Patriotic Citizen Award'' for flying a huge American flag at the
corner of his busy intersection.
   In the spring, the station's lush green lawn is ablaze with
4,000 tulips, daffodils and crocuses. In the summer, Brown plants
marigolds, begonias and cockscombs. This winter, it is filled with
nearly 500 decorative white and purple cabbages that cost about
$2,000.
   An elderly man in the neighborhood carved and painted a wooden
pelican for Brown, who placed it atop some pilings overlooking the
fountain pond where colorful Japanese carp swim in the summer.
   A local woman told Brown she makes a point of driving past his
station every day because the sight makes her feel good. ``Once you
get those comments, you just keep pouring it on,'' he said.
   Last year, Brown created a ``desert island'' of sand flanked by
two palm-like yucca trees and surrounded by a ``sea'' of tiny blue
flowers. When a beloved cherry tree died, Brown paid a Virginia
Beach artist $600 to build a Ninja Turtle to cover the stump.
   ``People are always asking, `What are you going to do next?' and
I don't know,'' he said. ``This afternoon, I guess I'll put a Santa
Claus cap on the turtle.''

   An American hostage who returned to the
United States Monday after four months trapped in Kuwait said he
spent 23 days hiding in an air conditioning duct with his dog.
   Tom Kreuzman, one of 155 hostages who arrived at Andrews Air
Force Base in Maryland Monday night, appeared gaunt and tired on
arrival in Tampa Monday night.
   The 38-year-old native of Holiday, Fla., said his Scottish
terrier, Chu Chu, was lost in the rush at Baghdad airport on
Sunday.
   ``It's a tragedy,'' said Kreuzman, a former U.S. Air Force
serviceman who worked for the Kuwaiti Defense Ministry as a
technician on their Hawk missile system. ``She made it that far.
She went through a lot with me over there.''
   Kreuzman said he felt guilty leaving behind the Kuwaitis who
helped him hide from Iraqi forces that crossed into Kuwait on Aug.
2.
   He said he initially avoided capture by hiding in a cramped
crawl space in his apartment for 23 days beginning on Oct. 6. He
said he ate only dry spaghetti.
   Kreuzman said he used a cordless phone to stay in touch with a
network of about 100 people in hiding in Kuwait. Through this
network, friends enabled him to transfer to a safe house in late
October, he said.
   They stayed there until they heard a radio broadcast that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein had agreed to release all foreign
hostages.
   ``He told us it was horrible,'' his mother, Elsie Janos, said in
a telephone interview from her home in the Florida Gulf town of
Holiday, 15 miles northwest of Tampa. She didn't know why her son
eventually left his hiding place.
   Mrs. Janos said she had only one brief note from her son. ``It
said he was in hiding close to Iraq and they were doing
house-to-house searches - wish him luck and say hello to his
girls.''
   She said he seemed upset over losing his dog when she talked
with him.
   ``Somehow the crate was dropped or opened and the dog got
loose,'' he said.``He didn't have time to look for her. He told me,
`I'm nervous and upset over it.' We're hoping maybe someone will
find her and bring her home.''
   Mrs. Janos said Kreuzman's family, which moved to Florida in
1973 from the Hamilton, Ohio area, is just happy he survived the
ordeal.
   ``With Thomas coming home, the children said this is the best
Christmas present they ever got,'' she said.

<HEAD>Reinstitution of Draft Gets Cold Shoulder From Key Lawmakers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mention reactivating the military draft to
lawmakers and they treat the term like a four-letter word.
   ``The last thing we need is a draft,'' said Rep. G.V. ``Sonny''
Montgomery, D-Miss., chairman of the House Veterans' Affairs
Committee and a senior member of the Armed Services Committee.
   The possibility of reinstituting the draft after a 17-year
absence has been raised in recent congressional hearings and
editorial columns.
   Former military officials have suggested that if President Bush
decides to use military force to oust Iraq from Kuwait, draft
notices should go out immediately to avoid troop shortages.
   Lawmakers have questioned whether the Pentagon's decision to put
a rotation policy on hold and wait before transferring forces in
and out of the gulf region would require a draft.
   By January, U.S. troops in the area will total more than 440,000
of the nearly 2.1 million active duty forces worldwide.
   The Selective Service System remains in operation and all men
must register with it within 30 days of their 18th birthdays, but
actual conscription ended in 1973 with the U.S. withdrawal from
Vietnam.
   Members of Congress with a powerful say on the issue, however,
said in interviews last week that there is little or no support for
a draft among their constituents at home or lawmakers on Capitol
Hill.
   ``It wouldn't fly anywhere. It wouldn't get off the ground,''
said Montgomery, a decorated Army veteran of World War II and the
Korean war.
   Montgomery, best known as the father of the latest GI Bill that
expanded health, education and housing benefits for military
personnel, said the all-volunteer force is ``doing the job.''
   ``The last thing we need is a draft. There are still a lot of
units to call up. It would really put the country in uproar. It's
really not necessary at all,'' Montgomery said.
   Two weeks ago, the United Nations backed a U.S.-crafted
resolution that authorized the use of military force to drive Iraq
from Kuwait if President Saddam Hussein fails to withdraw his
troops by Jan. 15.
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona, ranking Republican on the Senate
Armed Services subcommittee on manpower and personnel, suggested
that those mentioning a draft are using the issue to undercut
Bush's poliy.
   ``People who are the opponents of action in the Persian Gulf are
raising it as a straw man,'' said McCain, who believes the present
U.S. force is sufficient. ``I don't think the American people want
reinstitution of a draft and the specter would contribute to their
reluctance to support the president's policy in the Persian Gulf.''
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, chairman of the manpower and personnel
subcommittee, said he opposes a draft for now but that the United
States must keep its options open if the crisis persists.
   If Bush finds it difficult to sustain a force of more than
440,000 in the gulf after a year, ``either you cut a force of that
size or rotate people,'' Glenn said. ``If you don't want to cut at
that point, go to a draft - either a major recruiting campaign or a
draft.''
   Rep. Norman Dicks, D-Wash., a member of the House Appropriations
defense subcommittee, said another situation - a drawn-out war in
the gulf - might require reactivation of the draft.
   ``Should hostilities break out and go on for a while, I see a
scenario where people start saying consider a draft,'' Dicks said.
   He said the country does not have a large enough volunteer force
to support a prolonged military operation. The call for a draft
then would come from Congress, not the military, Dicks said.
   McCain contended, however, that reactivation of the draft would
be an indictment of the volunteer force.
   ``If this crisis drives us back to reinstitution of the draft
and this is a mid-size crisis, then an all-volunteer force will
have been a failure,'' he said.

<HEAD>Survey Shows Food Scarcest in Big Russian Cities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The highly publicized Soviet food shortage is most
acute in big Russian cities and seems milder in the countryside,
smaller cities and in non-Russian republics, a survey indicates.
   ``The situation is better here than in Russia,'' said Povilas
Klimas, deputy mayor of Vilnius, capital of the Baltic republic of
Lithuania, which declared independence in March. ``We're ready to
go ahead on our own.''
   Officials from the 12 cities surveyed by The Associated Press
said there was more food in farmers' markets than in state stores,
although prices were higher. They blamed shortages on panic-buying
and the collapse of the centralized distribution system, which is
not getting the harvest into cities.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has appealed to the West for food
to prevent winter unrest that he says may jeopardize his reforms.
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze carried the plea Monday to
Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   Gorbachev has said that much of this year's harvest has been
diverted from the state distribution system and sold privately. He
has called upon the KGB security police to make sure that Western
food aid is not siphoned off.
   An AP telephone survey found that food was plentiful in the
Baltic republics and Central Asia, and scarce in Russia and two
republics hit by ethnic unrest, Armenia and Moldavia.
   The survey found little fear of starvation, in keeping with more
thorough public opinion polls conducted by Soviet sociologists.
   In a poll published this week in the weekly newspaper Moscow
News, 27 percentbelieved that mass famine would commence this
winter, compared with 57 percent who thought it unlikely.
   The poll of 1,363 people by the Union Center for Public Opinion
and Market Research found that 58 percent expected widespread
strikes, which could aggravate the food shortage.
   The AP survey found that several Soviet cities have rationed
food, but it appeared to do little good where supplies were scarce,
as in Leningrad, the second-largest Russian city.
   Leningrad officials are trying to bypass the state distribution
system and buy directly from better-supplied regions, said
Lyudmilla Smirnova, a city government spokeswoman.
   Food is plentiful but rationed in nearby Tallinn, capital of
Estonia, another breakaway Baltic republic, said Mikhtel Pilving,
head of the city council secretariat.
   The monthly ration for butter is 1.1 pounds, and 4.4 pounds each
for sugar and grains, Pilving said.
   ``Yes, we have ration cards for vodka and other alcoholic
beverages,'' he said.
   Food supplies are better than last year in the Central Asian
republic of Uzbekistan, said Yuri Kukarin, editor of the Uzbek
Information Agency.
   ``There is a shortage of meat in state shops, but a wide variety
in the markets. And there is no problem with dairy products and
butter,'' he said.
   Although Uzbekistan has one of the lowest per capita incomes in
the Soviet Union, there has been no need to introduce rationing,
Kukarin said.
   ``We pray that the ration card infection does not spread to
us,'' he said. ``The situation is definitely ... much better than
in other regions. In the countryside, there are more fruits and
vegetables.''
   Food was also reported to be plentiful in the European republics
of Byelorussia and the Ukraine, and the Caucasian republic of
Georgia.
   Officials in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev have prevented
panic-buying by paying 70 percent of salaries in coupons that can
be redeemed for specific products, said Mikhail Derimov, editor of
the newspaper Pravda Ukraini.
   But the situation sounded grim in Armenia, which has yet to
recover from the earthquake of December 1988 and a civil war with
Azerbaijan.
   ``How can you ration something when there is nothing to
ration?'' said Karen Mikaelyan, aide to the Yerevan city council
member responsible for commerce in the Armenian capital. Ration
cards have been introduced for butter, cereals, sugar, cheese,
tobacco and coffee.
   Food supplies were fair but prices were four times 1989 levels
in Kishinev, the capital of Moldavia, which was hit by ethnic
unrest last month, said Valery Rinitse, deputy editor of the
Vechernaya Kishinev newspaper.
   ``The city committee against sabotage has found that food
supplies sent to state stores mysteriously disappear,'' he said.
``It is sold to speculators, then taken out of the city to other
regions or to other republics where they sell it at higher
prices.''
   Besides cracking down on theft, Moldavian officials have been
trying to buy food from better-supplied neighbors.
   ``This year, we'll be eating potatoes from Poland,'' said
Rinitse.

<HEAD>Head of Rural Co-Op Lending Program Says Some Borrowers in Trouble</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of the electric cooperatives that are a
mainstay of rural America are having trouble repaying billions in
low-interest government loans, according to the head of the agency
that issues the loans.
   Gary C. Byrne, who has run the Rural Electrification
Administration since March, said Monday that the agency's lending
program must be tightened to make it more responsible. The REA,
part of the Agriculture Department, has lent billions of dollars to
rural electric cooperatives.
   ``We have some difficult credit situations,'' Byrne said in his
first meeting with reporters. However, he added, ``I'm reasonably
confident that we're through the worst of the credit problems.''
   Eight rural electric cooperatives are in default on $2.3 billion
in loans from the REA; four of the eight are in Chapter 11
bankruptcy reorganization. The eight also owe $1.25 billion to
private creditors.
   Only a few of the nation's nearly 1,000 electric co-ops are in
serious trouble, but the money problems have made some experts
fearful of the REA's financial health. Nearly all the co-ops
nationwide have received low-interest federal loans or federal
guarantees for bank loans.
   The financial troubles gripping some electric co-ops and their
potential impact on the federal loan program were disclosed in an
article by The Associated Press.
   Byrne, the first banker to be appointed REA administrator, said
the outlook for co-ops will depend on the health of the economy and
on the weather. If the economy is weak or the weather is warmer
than usual this winter, he said, demand for electricity - and
consequently the co-ops' revenue - would decrease.
   Byrne said the REA has adopted a strategy that includes steering
financially healthy co-ops toward the private market for their
loans and weaning them away from federal aid. The agency plans to
reduce the number of low-interest loans it grants and replace them
with loan guarantees.
   In addition, he said, the REA needs to revise its lending
policies to better distinguish between the co-ops with the greatest
financial need and those less in need of federal funds.
   The new approach ``does assure the American taxpayers that if
the money is loaned out, that money will be returned,'' Byrne said.
   The rural electrification program, set up in the mid-1930s,
radically changed U.S. agriculture by providing the cheap electric
power that enabled farmers to modernize. But critics complain that
the program no longer serves a useful purpose and is a waste of
taxpayers' money.
   The Bush administration, looking for ways to reduce the swelling
federal budget deficit, has mounted a quiet attack on the REA
subsidies. The Office of Management and Budget, in a recent memo to
the Energy Department, proposed phasing out all REA subsidies over
10 years.
   ``I think we're going to be battling for funds over the next
several years,'' Byrne said. ``You keep the program strong by
making the program financially responsible.''
   The biggest losses have been posted by big cooperatives that
generate their own electricity. Most of the smaller co-ops - which
are members of the generating co-ops and only distribute
electricity - are in sound financial shape.
   The REA has proposed new administrative rules that would, among
other things, require the smaller distribution co-ops to guarantee
loans made to their parent cooperatives.
   Byrne, who was appointed by President Bush to a 10-year term,
formerly was chairman of the Bank of Alex Brown in Sacramento,
Calif. Before Byrne, REA administrators had come from a farming or
ranching background.

   The arrival of 1991 has been postponed.
   The new year will be a second late, to accommodate a ``leap
second'' that will be inserted Dec. 31 to keep clocks in time with
the Earth.
   The problem is that modern atomic clocks are too darn accurate.
   They hardly vary at all, being accurate to within a billionth of
a second a day, according to the U.S. Naval Observatory, the
government office in charge of keeping track of what time it is.
   The rotation of the Earth, on the other hand, isn't nearly that
consistent.
   It speeds up a bit sometimes, slows down other times.
   Our original clock, the rotation of the Earth, is consistent to
only about one-thousandth of a second a day, says the National
Institute of Standards and Technology, the agency in charge of
measuring units of time.
   In the past, slight irregularities in the Earth's rotation
didn't matter.
   But now, the really accurate clocks get out of time with the
slightly wobbly world. And since the planet can't be adjusted, the
clocks must be.
   Because the Earth as slowed a bit, the clocks have been getting
ahead of it. They must be slowed down to keep them on time.
   This year's leap second will occur at 23:59:59 universal
coordinated time. That's 6:59 p.m. and 59 seconds, Eastern Standard
Time.
   Normally, 6:59:59 p.m. EST is followed by 7:00:00. But on Dec.
31 of this year it will be followed by 6:59:60, and that will be
followed by 7 p.m.
   Universal coordinated time, formerly known as Greenwich Mean
Time, is the international time standard.
   The international agreement calling for the insertion of a leap
second, when needed, was signed in 1972. This will be the 16th leap
second added since then.

   British aid agencies say millions of people in the
four corners of Africa face starvation as early as January, and
some compare the situation to the Ethiopian famine that shocked the
world five years ago.
   John Magrath, a spokesman for the Oxfam charity, said Monday he
had received a telex from a worker just back from the Ethiopian
province of Eritrea:
   ``Terrible drought,'' it said. ``Animals dying. People already
on the move.''
   Oxfam has joined with six other agencies to form the British
Disaster Emergency Committee, which is launching an appeal in the
new year for funds to assist Ethiopia, the Sudan, Mozambique,
Angola and Liberia.
   The requests for help for Africa come at a time when the
European Community is pulling together a $2 billion food aid
program for the Soviet Union, Oxfam spokesman Tony Vaux noted.
   ``A problem is building while the world is looking elsewhere,''
he said.
   The other participating agencies are the British Red Cross,
Action Aid, Christian Aid, the Catholic Fund for Overseas
Development, the Save the Children Fund and Help the Aged.
   Announcing the appeal on Monday, the groups set no financial
target but said they were appealing on behalf of ``victims of a
major famine now threatening millions of people in many parts of
Africa.''
   The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization has appealed for 1.3
million tons of food aid for Sudan - 1 million tons for relief and
the rest to replenish depleted stocks. It said major and immediate
relief is needed to avert calamitous famine.
   Mozambique's government says half of its 16.3 million people
face deprivation or death because of food shortages aggravated by a
15-year-old civil war.
   Liberia is suffering food shortage compounded by the disruption
of war. In Angola, an estimated 1.9 million people are affected by
food shortages.
   Oxfam workers John Wilding and Trish Silkin said Monday that
they had found a near-total crop failure in Eritrea and severe crop
failures in another civil war-ravaged Ethiopian province, Tigre.
   ``There will be a food crisis in Eritrea as early as January
unless there is an expanded program of relief,'' said Wilding, who
estimated that 2.5 million Eritreans are at risk of death from
hunger or thirst.
   In Eritrea, Wilding said, there were no crops to assess. ``There
is an almost complete lack of grazing, and livestock is in an
extremely poor condition. Water levels are falling below the
bottoms of many wells.''
   The situation is less severe in neighboring Tigre, Wilding said,
but 2.2 million people need food aid, he said.
   Ms. Silkin said the conditions in Ethiopia were similar to that
preceding the disastrous famine of 1984-85, when about 2 million
Africans died of starvation or famine-related ailments, about half
of them in Ethiopia.
   ``The potential for the same situation is there,'' she said, but
added that now there is an effective distribution system for food
relief.
   A report prepared for a World Bank meeting in Paris on Monday
said Mozambique would need more than 1 million tons of food aid
next year to stave off mass starvation.
   ``Massive, direct, emergency assistance is required now,'' the
report says.
   The FAO has promised 25,000 tons of wheat, 19,000 of which have
been delivered. No other donors have made any commitments.
   It is the second consecutive year of severe food deficits in
Sudan because of lack of rain.
   The harvest also has been hindered in the south by a civil war
that has killed hundreds of thousands of people in eight years and
displaced many more.
   Estimates of the number of people at risk in the Sudan vary from
3 million to 11 million.
   Adam Kellett-Long of the British Disasters Emergency Committee
said the civil war in Liberia was causing widespread famine and
making it difficult to distributed aid.
   ``Reports we have say people are already starving there and some
say up to 80 percent of the inhabitants have malnutrition,'' he
said.
   A U.N. relief program for Angola began early in November, after
the government and rebels of the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola agreed to let the convoys pass.

<HEAD>Administration Drawing Up Blueprint for Meeting Energy Needs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senior Bush administration officials are
considering suggestions ranging from a stiff gasoline tax to eased
environmental rules as part of a blueprint for dealing with the
nation's future energy needs.
   The national energy strategy has been in the works at the Energy
Department for 18 months, but it attracted increased attention
after America's dependence on foreign oil was highlighted by the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   The department has put together 67 options for consideration by
an inter-agency task force at the White House, with a pared-down
selection of proposals to be given President Bush before Christmas.
A draft energy plan is to be announced early next year.
   Many of the options already are under attack from
environmentalists, who say the administration is paying too little
attention to energy conservation and too much attention to
production - at times at the risk of harming the environment.
   ``There's no vision. There is simply a long list of options,''
Christopher Flavin, an energy specialist at the Worldwatch
Institute, said of the proposals leaked so far.
   ``All signs point to a policy that will reward and placate
entrenched energy interests'' at the expense of conservation and
development of renewable energy such as wind and solar, said Edwin
Rothschild, energy policy director for Citizen Action, a
Washington-based consumer advocacy group.
   Linda Stuntz, assistant undersecretary for policy and planning
at the Energy Department, said she expects the final plan to
provide ``a balanced menu of both supply and demand'' proposals.
   The energy strategy is hoped to allow Bush to break the logjam
for new energy initiatives in Congress as he did in the area of new
clean air legislation, she suggested.
   Among proposals almost certain to be included in a final package
are those aimed at streamlining regulations to ease the
construction of nuclear power plants and the building of new
natural gas pipelines, officials say.
   But some of the other proposals are thought less likely to
survive.
   These include a suggestion that Congress impose a
50-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax, set federal energy efficiency
standards for new houses and require automakers to increase fuel
economy of new cars to as much as 36.5 miles per gallon by the end
of the decade.
   To increase domestic energy production, the proposals include
tax credits for oil and gas drilling and opening federal lands -
including wilderness areas, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and
parts of the Outer Continental Shelf - to energy exploration.
   While those approaches have the administration's ear, they are
likely to meet strong opposition from environmentalists and
lawmakers.
   Energy Secretary James Watkins made the national energy policy a
priority when he took office in March 1989. The plan gained a fresh
momentum after the Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   But Ms. Stuntz expressed concern recently that public interest
and political support for an energy program may wane once the gulf
crisis and oil prices subside. ``Will the public's interest in a
national energy policy remain the same if gasoline prices are back
at $1 or so (a gallon) next summer?'' she asked.
   She and other Energy Department officials declined to discuss
specific proposals, although senior officials such as White House
chief of staff John Sununu have emphasized that the focus must be
on measures driven by market forces and not new government
regulations.
   Some of the options under consideration would require regulators
to formally take energy impact into account whenever an agency
considers new environmental regulations. That ``may be viewed as
attempts to bypass environmental requirements and reduce public
oversight,'' an Energy Department document.
   Among other proposals are:
   -An expansion of the gas-guzzler tax on cars combined with a
system of tax credits for buying fuel-efficient vehicles.
   -Incentives to promote alternative fuel vehicles, including the
government buying 60,000 such vehicles and spending $10 billion
over 10 years to establish 70,000 retail alternative fuel outlets.
   -Restructuring the utility industry to reduce the cost of
electricity through increased competition.

<HEAD>FRA Redesigning Railroad Inspection System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Railroad Administration,
responding to a stream of sharp criticism from congressional
investigators, is redesigning its inspection system in an effort to
assure the safety of U.S. railways.
   Acknowledging deficiencies in the current inspection system, FRA
Administrator Gilbert E. Carmichael said the changes will help
assure continued public confidence in the safety of rail travel as
the nation plans and builds a high-speed rail system.
   The railroad administration has been the subject of four
critical reports this year by the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress.
   The reports, requested by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman
of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, concluded that the FRA
did not have enough hazardous-materials inspectors and probably was
deficient in other inspection areas.
   These include inspections of track, locomotive power and
equipment, operating practices and signal and train control.
   In July, the GAO said the Transportation Department agency was
not using available data to target routine inspections toward
high-risk locations and toward railroads with poor safety records.
   It said FRA inspectors independently schedule their safety
inspections without analyzing safety or accident data.
   ``As a result, railroads with increasing numbers of accidents
did not receive additional inspection activity,'' the GAO said.
``We found in many cases inspections decreased for railroads with
increasing number of accidents.''
   The most recent GAO report, issued late last month, took the
review of the agency one step further.
   ``FRA does not know how many inspectors it needs to adequately
cover the railroad industry ...,'' the GAO said. ``FRA does not
know whether it has a sufficient number of safety inspectors to
carry out its safety mission because FRA has not developed
inspection coverage standards.''
   Carmichael's response is to redesign the inspection system, a
process he says will take 12 to 15 months.
   ``At the end of that time I'd like to be able to say to the GAO,
we've got the system in place, `go check it,' so Congress will be
comfortable and the public will be comfortable,'' Carmichael said
at briefing last week.
   Dingell said that so far he is encouraged by the changes. In a
letter to Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner he said: ``I
applaud the initiatives that you and Gil (Carmichael) have
undertaken thus far to implement the recommendations ....''
   Carmichael said the changes are designed to improve the training
of the 361 authorized federal inspectors and the 110 inspectors
employed by state governments.
   He said it also is aimed at ensuring that the inspectors are
properly deployed, that key areas such as the transport of
hazardous materials are not neglected and that the statistics
gathered to support the inspection system are timely, complete and
accurate.
   Carmichael said that when he became head of the FRA at the
beginning of the Bush administration, statistics were so poor that
``we didn't know exactly how many railroads there were in this
country.''
   Recordkeeping has improved and now he does. There were 580
railroads then. Now there are 605, an increase caused in part by
large railroads spinning off their lines to small carriers.
   Perry Rivkind, Carmichael's deputy, said that when accidents at
rail grade crossings and those involving trespassers on railroad
property are discounted, some 40 people a year lose their lives in
railroad accidents.
   Compared with the 45,500 killed in highway accidents in 1989
alone, ``it is obvious that railroads are an incredibly safe mode
of transportation,'' he said.
   Carmichael promised that statistics will be improved, a
comprehensive teaching and operations manual written for
inspectors, a training academy established, standards for
inspectors raised and the inspection staff kept at full strength
through aggressive recruitment and hiring.
   Furthermore, he said, inspectors will be allocated to problem
areas on a national basis. Previously, he said, the FRA had a
regional inspection plan with little uniformity on the national
level or in the way the system dealt with problem areas.
   Carmichael said the transport of hazardous materials will get
special priority, although he stressed there has been no fatal
accident in that area since 1980.
   ``I live with a Bhopal in the back of my mind,'' he said,
referring to the December 1984 chemical leak at a Union Carbide
pesticide plant at Bhopal, India, that killed 3,403 people and
injured 20,000.

<HEAD>Bush Administration to Seek Up to $20 Billion for Desert Shield</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush does not plan to raise taxes to
pay for Operation Desert Shield, and will ask Congress next month
for $12 billion to $20 billion to cover the troop deployment,
congressional officials say.
   Bush believes the overall costs of keeping more than 400,000
U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf area for a possible confrontation
with Iraq will be as much as $30 billion in fiscal 1991, which runs
through next Sept. 30, the officials said Monday.
   But the administration is counting on receiving at least $7
billion from U.S. allies to defray those expenses, said the
sources, who asked not to be identified.
   Those figures would not cover the dramatically more expensive
costs that would be incurred should war break out. By one estimate,
fighting could cost $1 billion to $2 billion a day.
   One congressional aide said the administration planned to send
the detailed request to Congress in late January.
   Under the five-year budget bill enacted last month, possible
expenditures for Desert Shield were left unlimited. The government
also was authorized to pay the expenses by simply borrowing the
money.
   Some Democrats in Congress have said a temporary surcharge on
income taxes might be necessary if fighting breaks out and costs
soar.
   According to the Defense Department, Kuwait has committed itself
to contribute $2.5 billion, the United Arab Emirates $1 billion,
Japan $2 billion, Germany $1.1 billion, South Korea $95 million,
and Saudi Arabia an unspecified amount of food, fuel, water
facilities and transportation assistance.
   In September, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said he expected the
year's bill for keeping just more than 200,000 troops in the gulf
to not exceed $15 billion. Since Bush's Nov. 8 announcement that he
would double the deployment, the administration has not publicly
estimated the additional cost.
   Congressional aides said they were unsure whether the costs
would double if the number of troops also doubled.
   Pentagon spending is increasing because of reservists who have
been called up and because Desert Shield troops are receiving $110
per month in hazardous-duty pay, they said.
   However, they noted, many of the new troops are being sent to
the Middle East from bases in Europe, a shorter and cheaper trip
than the journey from the United States many of the first soldiers
made. In addition, the Pentagon is not hurrying the extra troops to
the Gulf as it did the first wave.
   ``If there's no rush to get there, you can put them on ships
that will take two weeks to get there but cost a lot less money
than flying them,'' one aide said.
   Last week, Robert Reischauer, director of the Congressional
Budget Office, told lawmakers that it would cost about $12 billion
for the 400,000-troop force to remain in the gulf for a year -
excluding contributions from allies.
   House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., has said
war with Iraq could cost $1 billion to $2 billion daily.
   But Republican congressional aides have said they believe that
figure is too high. At a hearing last week, Reischauer told Panetta
that a $1-billion-per-day price tag was ``wildly too high.''

<HEAD>CIA Reports Increase in Third World Debt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Third World countries' foreign debt rose to
$1.096 trillion this year, up from $1.051 trillion last year and
from $786 billion in 1984, the Central Intelligence Agency reports.
   The figure does not include the Soviet Union, China and other
countries either still under communist rule or emerging from it,
such as those in eastern Europe. Those countries add at least
another $210 billion, according to earlier estimates by the CIA and
the World Bank.
   The money is owed to more affluent governments including the
United States, Japan and West Germany, to their private commercial
banks and to intergovernmental bodies like the World Bank. Another
$29 billion owed to the International Monetary Fund is listed
separately.
   Although the CIA reported a rise of $45 billion in the debt
since last year, it showed that payments dropped to $122 billion
from the $126 billion of 1989.
   For the debtors the payment level is more important than debt
itself. Each dollar they save on payments to their creditors is a
dollar they can spend on new foreign goods.
   They can use foreign goods either to raise their people's living
standards or to invest in new equipment that will produce more
goods and jobs for their rapidly rising work force.
   The CIA handbook includes information compiled from the World
Bank and the International Monetary Fund in Washington, the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris and
the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland.
   The book consists only of tables and does not explain the rise
and fall of figures.
   Of the 113 countries listed, the heaviest debt is reported for
Brazil: $115.341 billion, up from $112.15 billion in 1989. Brazil
also owes about $8 billion in back interest, but the CIA does not
include such arrears in its figures. They show Brazil as paying
$10.1 billion on its debt this year, compared with $11.9 billion
last year and $16.1 billion the year before.
   The new government of President Fernando Collor de Mello is deep
in negotiations with private banks, to which it owes the bulk of
its debt. They are urging at least some payments on the back
interest.
   Mexico's debt of $88.02 billion is the second largest, reduced
under the plan of Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. Last year
it was $90.789 billion. Mexico's payments also have dropped due to
the new arrangement, to $10.06 billion this year from last year's
$13.104 billion.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy's A-12 stealth aircraft program,
already under attack for cost overruns and schedule delays, now is
the focus of a criminal probe, the Defense Department says.
   ``The U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri
presently is conducting and directing a criminal investigation into
the overpayment of progress payments,'' the Pentagon's inspector
general, Susan Crawford, said Monday.
   Crawford made the disclosure at a House Armed Services Committee
hearing on the attack plane, designed to replace the Navy's aging
fleet of A-6 Intruders aboard aircraft carriers starting in 1995.
   ``Both the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, which works
for me, and the Naval Investigative Service are working in a joint
fashion under the direction of the U.S. attorney,'' she said.
   The plane's contractors, McDonnell Douglas Corp. and General
Dynamics Corp., are based in St. Louis.
   The Navy announced last week that it was removing three top
overseers of the A-12 program, including two admirals, for failing
to disclose serious flaws in the aircraft's development.
   Five weeks after Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told Congress in
April that the program was on track, it was disclosed that the A-12
was 18 months behind schedule and more than $1 billion over the
planned $4.7 billion cost.
   Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett told Cheney last week that he
was forcing Vice Adm. Richard C. Gentz, commander of the Naval Air
Systems Command, to retire by Feb. 1.
   Garrett also said he was reassigning Rear Adm. John F. Calvert,
the program executive officer for tactical aircraft programs, and
Capt. Lawrence S. Elberfeld, A-12 program manager, and writing each
a letter of censure.
   But Garrett said he would not stop Elberfeld's scheduled
promotion to rear admiral.
   Garrett, testifying before the House panel Monday, faced
criticism for that decision from Rep. Andy Ireland, R-Fla.
   ``I wonder what message you send when you include censure and a
promotion as well,'' Ireland asked.
   ``The message is already clear,'' Garrett responded.
   ``That you can be promoted,'' Ireland interrupted.
   The Navy secretary argued that the promotion of Elberfeld was
based on his 20 years of service and the censure even with the
promotion would be ``embarrassing and debilitating'' to Elberfeld's
future career.
   An internal Navy report and the Pentagon inspector general's
investigation indicated last week that the government did not
sufficiently challenge overly optimistic cost and schedule
estimates of the contractors.
   The Navy report said McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics
contract officials failed to tell the Navy of cost and schedule
problems.
   Garrett testified that briefings from the Navy's management team
on the A-12 program ``gave no indication of risk that the contract
would not be completed within its ceiling price, nor any risk that
first flight and the follow-on test program would not be
achieved.''
   The Navy secretary blamed ``human errors in judgment'' for
problems with the aircraft that were never reported. He added that
although the current procurement system works, individuals ``find
it very hard to push bad news up to the top.''

<HEAD>1990 Wasn't a Terrific Year for NASA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When NASA looks back to 1990, no one will sing
``it was a very good year.'' But, hey, there's always 1991.
   The space shuttle Columbia, which set records for giving trouble
on the ground before the launch and in orbit afterward, is home
aftr encountering what NASA Administrator Richard Truly called
``unbelievable difficulties.''
   Launch crews and mission planners have a rest of more than two
months before the next flight, the first of seven scheduled for
1991. That mission is to deploy unclassified payloads for the Air
Force and the Strategic Defense Organization.
   Columbia's mission was the sixth and last for a shuttle in 1990,
a year of embarrassments for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   In April, the Hubble Space Telescope was launched with fanfare,
but it later was found to be not nearly as sharp-eyed as promised.
In May, the first of five tries to launch Columbia found the
shuttle to be leaking dangerously. That was fixed, but during the
mission, science computers had to be shut down and so was the
toilet. Then the threat of bad weather at Edwards Air Force Base
forced the landing to be moved up by a day.
   ``If we were in the business of constantly trying to make
ourselves look good, we would plan to achieve very little and then
surprise everybody because we achieved twice as much,'' Truly said.
   On Monday, as the astronauts were packing up, a committee formed
to make recommendations for NASA said the space agency should use
the shuttle only when human presence is required in space. The
agency should put most of its efforts on science, the panel said.
   The space science program ``ranks above space stations,
aerospace planes, manned missions to the planets and many other
major pursuits which often receive greater visibility,'' said the
government's Advisory Committee on the Future of the U.S. Space
Program.
   The committee wants NASA to forego a fifth shuttle after the
ship Endeavour joins the fleet, using the money saved to develop a
heavy-lift rocket to use on all missions except those requiring
astronauts.
   It would add a Mission From Planet Earth - to explore space - to
the currently planned Mission to Planet Earth, which is planned as
an all-encompassing environmental study. And the committee
recommends a down-sized, cheaper space station devoted to life
sciences and microgravity research.
   The committee was formed as NASA's embarrassments piled up
earlier this year. But Norman Augustine, chairman of the 12-member
panel, told reporters that ``NASA is neither as troubled as some
suggest nor as good as it will have to be to carry out the program
we have recommended.''
   He and Truly differed on whether another shuttle should be
built. The agency boss said ``We should not give up the ability to
build one if for any reason we need to build another one.''
   Augustine, however, said it's only a matter of time until the
shuttle program has another disaster like the one that destroyed
Challenger and its crew of seven in 1986.
   The planned 1991 missions include an April trip in which the
Gamma Ray Observatory is to be carried into orbit, and in May, a
space life sciences laboratory is to ride aboard Columbia.
   Discovery is to fly in July with another in a series of tracking
and data relay satellites, which gather information from other
satellites and space shuttles and send it to the ground.
   Atlantis is to fly in August with several Defense Department
payloads on a mission lasting 10 days. Discovery is scheduled again
in November with the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite; and the
final launch is that of Atlantis in December, carrying a manned
scientific laboratory in its cargo bay.

   Armand Hammer, the socialist's son who became
a titan of American capitalism and a tireless crusader for world
peace and a cancer cure, died Monday night. He was 92.
   He died at his home after a brief illness, said Frank Ashley, a
spokesman for Hammer's Occidental Petroleum Corp.
   The affable Hammer was a self-made millionaire by the time he
graduated from Columbia University medical school at age 23.
Throughout a life of international wheeling and dealing, he was on
a first-name basis with world leaders from Vladimir Lenin to Ronald
Reagan.
   His empire rested in Occidental, based in Los Angeles. He bought
the tottering company for $100,000 in 1957, during a try at
retirement, then turned it into the nation's seventh-largest oil
company by running it as his personal fiefdom.
   Ray Irani, Occidental president and chief operating officer,
became the new chairman immediately, the company said.
   Hammer's death came one night before he was to celebrate his bar
mitzvah, 79 years late, at a star-studded ceremony and fund-raiser.
He was born a Jew but his socialist family did not observe
religious customs.
   Hammer was pardoned in 1989 b President Bush for making illegal
contributions to President Nixon's re-election campaign in 1972. He
had pleaded guilty in 1976 and received a year's probation and a
$3,000 fine.
   Hammer was in the forefront of negotiating huge deals with
communist countries to develop untapped natural resources.
   He made several fortunes in his lifetime and made large
charitable donations.``The only reason I make money is so I can
give it away,'' he was fond of saying.
   Hammer said he had two dreams - a cure for cancer and peace
between East and West. He urged American and Soviet leaders to
agree on limits on nuclear weapons, so the money could be diverted
to agriculture and medicine.
   He gave millions of dollars to cancer research, and President
Reagan named him chairman of the President's Cancer Panel.
   After the Chernobyl nuclear accident in the Soviet Union, he
arranged visits by U.S. specialists in bone-marrow transplants, an
important technique for saving radiation victims.
   Occidental spent $96 million on the Armand Hammer Museum of Art
and Culture to house his collection, which Hammer estimated to be
worth more than $400 million. The museum opened last month.
   Hammer was born in 1898 in a cold-water flat in New York City's
Lower East Side. His great-grandfather built warships for Czar
Nicholas I, while his Russian-born father was a doctor and a
founder of the American Socialist Party.
   But Hammer was a staunch capitalist who was fond of saying of
his communist business partners: ``I tell them in no uncertain
terms that I don't think their system works ... But that doesn't
keep us from doing business.''
   After serving in the U.S. Army Medical Corps in World War I,
Hammer went to medical school at night and worked during the day to
bail out the family's small, nearly bankrupt pharmaceutical firm.
He turned it into a million-dollar company.
   After the Bolshevik Revolution, he worked out a deal to trade
surplus U.S. grain for Soviet products.
   Overnight Hammer became a Soviet hero. Lenin granted him a
license as the sole representative of 38 leading American
manufacturers, including Ford, Allis Chalmers, U.S. Rubber and
Underwood Typewriters.
   Hammer was married three times and had one child, Julian, by his
first wife. His third wife, Frances, died in 1989.
   Funeral arrangements were not immediately known.

<HEAD>Lithuania President Says Soviets About to Cut Off Food and Supplies
Again</HEAD>

   Lithuania's president says the Soviets have
informed his government they will cut off shipments of food and raw
materials to the breakaway republic beginning Jan. 1.
   President Vytautas Landsbergis, who met with President Bush at
the White House on Monday, told The Associated Press afterward the
Soviets are not characterizing the step as a renewal of the
blockade imposed after Lithuania declared its independence from
Soviet rule last March 11.
   ``They are saying `we have nothing for you,''' Landsbergis said
in an interview. ``And everything we would have gotten, our
portion, is going to be divided up for everyone else. Nothing will
be left for us.''
   He said the present dispute is over Lithuania's refusal to go
along with an economic plan that he said would return the republic
to the control of Soviet central planners and impose a Soviet
budget, financial and tax system. The Kremlin also is demanding
nearly all of Lithuania's foreign currency revenues, he said.
   ``The Soviets have given us an ultimatum,'' he said. ``Since we
are determined not to capitulate to the demands of that ultimatum,
we don't know what consequences await us after the end of this
year.''
   The leader of the tiny Baltic republic said Lithuania is not as
short of food as other Soviet republics but that ``it could be very
bad in the winter if the Soviets cut all the supplies, including
the grain, heating oil, sugar, as they did during the blockade.''
   He said he hoped his meeting with Bush, the first between a U.S.
and Lithuanian president, would result in the United States issuing
a statement ``that will stay the hand of the Soviets or even result
in a pledge from the Soviets that they are not going to use
military or economic violence against us.''
   Bush spokesman Marlin Fitzwater issued a statement Monday
calling for peaceful settlement of disputes between the Soviets and
the Baltic republics.
   The statement said Bush expressed his hope that ``the Soviet
government would work constructively with Baltic leaders, without
resorting to threats, intimidation or the use of force.''
   Soviet foreign minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze was scheduled to
meet with Bush in Washington today, and Landsbergis said he was
confident the subject would be raised.
   The Lithuanians export meat to their neighboring Soviet
republics, but Landsbergis said the threatened cutoff of feed
grains ``would destroy our agricultural system in months.''
   He quoted a high-level Soviet official as boasting, ``You will
slaughter your animals this winter.''
   Landsbergis said it was not clear whether heating oil and other
petroleum products also would be cut off.
   Lithuania was practically brought to its knees earlier this year
when the Kremlin imposed a tough economic embargo in an effort to
force the republic to halt setting up its own border controls and
taking other steps to establish its independence from the Soviet
Union.
   The embargo was halted when Lithuania agreed to suspend steps it
was taking unilaterally and enter into negotiations with the Soviet
Union toward establishing the republic's eventual independence.
Little progress has been reported in getting the talks underway.

   Scientists say pictures of the far side
of the moon taken by the spacecraft Galileo will help fill a blank
spot on the map of the planet.
   The pictures, taken as Galileo sped past the moon and Earth on
its six-year voyage to Jupiter, also should reveal more about the
mineral content of the moon's crust, scientists said Monday.
   ``We're actually doing some new observation,'' said James Head,
a member of Galileo's imaging team at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration displayed
black and white photos of the full moon that provided a sharp image
of the Orientale Basin as well as portions of both the near and far
sides of the moon.
   The spacecraft swung into the Earth's gravitational field
Saturday, hurtling 597 miles above the western Atlantic at the
point of its closest approach.
   By sweeping near Earth, Galileo was able to use gravitational
pull like a slingshot to increase its speed by 11,600 mph, boosting
its velocity to 79,000 mph in relation to the sun.
   Galileo's approach allowed scientists to focus the craft's
cameras on the far side of the moon for the first exploration of
the region since NASA's Apollo missions in the 1970s.
   The cameras photographed a wedge of moonscape near the south
pole on the far side that somehow was missed by previous U.S. and
Soviet mapping missions, said project scientist Torrence Johnson.
   ``That's interesting, it's got craters just like the rest of the
moon, but there's no great scientific surprise in that,'' Johnson
said.
   A subsequent journey through the Earth's magnetic field gave
scientists their first measurements of a solar storm in which
magnetically charged ions take on higher energy levels.
   The data could reveal whether the majority of these ions, which
trigger colorful auroras near Earth's magnetic poles, come from the
sun or Earth, said Lou Frank, chairman of Galileo's magnetic field
working group.

birthday messages on a pay telephone line set up for Ol' Blue Eyes
as he turns 75.
   Piscopo, who imitates Sinatra in his comedy routine, and the
other celebrities kicked off the birthday hotline Monday.
   For a maximum $4 charge, callers who dial 1-900-420-2448 can
record messages for Sinatra, who turns 75 on Wednesday. Profits
will go to charity.
   The hotline will remain open through October 1991, then the
messages will be given to Sinatra, said Esther Perman, a
spokeswoman for Chivas Regal, the sponsor of Sinatra's Diamond
Jubilee world tour. The tour begins today in New Jersey.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Teen-age actor Corey Feldman admitted
possessing heroin and cocaine but avoided jail in a plea bargain
that bars him from working in movies or TV while he undergoes drug
rehabilitation.
   Feldman, who appeared in such films as ``Stand By Me'' and ``The
Lost Boys,'' was fined $5,000 Monday and placed on four years'
probation.
   In exchange for his no-contest pleas, prosecutors agreed to
dismiss charges of transporting heroin and possessing the drug for
sale.
   As part of the deal, Feldman agreed to finish a seven-month drug
program he entered in October but was suspended from recently for
having an unauthorized visitor.
   During rehabilitation, Feldman will be barred from working in
the entertainment industry, said attorney Richard Hirsch.
   Feldman, 19, was found with drugs twice after roadside stops. He
also was arrested for driving with a suspended license.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Ninety-year-old actress Helen Hayes says she
wants a rough-hewn British compliment, taken from a play about
Queen Victoria, chiseled on her tombstone.
   In the play, the line ``Go it, old girl! You've done well!'' is
shouted by a coarse-looking man who breaks through police lines at
Victoria's 90th birthday.
   ``I've always meant, since I (heard) that line, to have it put
on my tombstone,'' Miss Hayes told the Hollywood Women's Press Club
on Sunday.
   Miss Hayes and actor Dennis Weaver were honored with the club's
Louella O. Parsons awards, which recognize performers who project
outstanding images in the entertainment industry.

   NEW YORK (AP) - ``Godfather III'' co-star Andy Garcia says he's
proud of his Cuban heritage but hates being known as a ``Hispanic
heartthrob.''
   ``There's nothing that I cherish more than my culture and what I
am,'' he said in January's Glamour magazine. ``But to call me the
great Hispanic actor is ridiculous; it's racism. They don't call
Dustin Hoffman the great Jewish-American actor.''
   Garcia's family fled Cuba in 1961 when he was 5.
   The 34-year-old actor has appeared in such films as ``The
Untouchables,'' ``Internal Affairs'' and ``Black Rain.'' In the
``Godfather'' sequel scheduled for release on Christmas, Garcia
plays Vincent Mancini, the illegitimate son of a slain mafia
prince.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - An obsessed fan who pleaded guilty to sending
threatening letters to actress Stephanie Zimbalist was sentenced to
two years in prison.
   U.S. District Judge John G. Davies also ordered Michael Lawrence
Shields, 42, of Plymouth, Mich., to undergo psychiatric counseling.
   He also was prohibited from approaching or trying to contact 26
people, including the actress and her father, actor Efrem Zimbalist
Jr.
   ``He created a well-founded fear in Miss Zimbalist and disrupted
her life,'' said Davies.
   Starting in 1988, Shields sent 212 letters signed ``Your Secret
Admirer,'' to Miss Zimbalist, 34, who starred in the detective
series ``Remington Steele.''
   In one letter, he wrote, ``Dear Stephanie, You can run, but you
can't hide.''

   The Postal Service should rescind a decision
to reduce delivery standards for some mail, according to a report
prepared for Congress.
   The post office cut back some overnight delivery areas in July,
saying the changes would save money and improve efficiency. The
agency said the changes would slow delivery of only about 5 percent
of first-class mail.
   The change could slow delivery of as many as 4.3 billion pieces
of mail over a year, according to the report by the House
Government Operations Committee and titled ``Just Say Slow.''
   In 1989, the post office carried 85.8 billion pieces of
first-class mail. Five percent of that would be 4.3 billion.
   The report issued Monday said the Postal Service implemented the
change without demonstrating that it would lead to any improvement
for the public.
   ``Our investigation indicates that many customers - especially
those in rural America - will suffer because of the new
standards,'' Rep. Bob Wise, D-W. Va., said in a statement.
   Wise is chairman of the government information subcommittee of
the House Government Operations Committee, which released the
report.

<HEAD>NTSB Chairman Presses States to Lift Licenses of Drunken Drivers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal safety official wants a national
campaign to persuade 21 states to pass laws to confiscate the
licenses of drivers who fail or refuse drunken-driving tests.
   James L. Kolstad, chairman of the National Transportation Safety
Board, told a meeting of the National Commission on Drunk Driving
that license confiscation is a ``simple, direct and inexpensive''
way to attack a problem blamed for 60 deaths a day or nearly 22,000
fatalities a year.
   Such laws already have been passed by 29 states and the District
of Columbia, and Kolstad said Monday they have resulted in
substantial decreases of drunken driving.
   Kolstad's proposal, recently listed as one of the safety board's
``most-wanted'' safety changes, would require the immediate
confiscation of a license if a driver either fails a sobriety test
or refuses to take one.
   Under the program, a driver is given a temporary license and
given the option of an administrative hearing.
   ``That hearing establishes only one basic fact: did the driver
indeed fail the test or refuse to take it?'' Kolstad said. ``If the
answer is `yes,' the driver's license is revoked on the spot.
   According to the Safety Board, the 21 states which have not
passed such laws are: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Kentucky,
Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New
Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina,
South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Washington.

   The White House Christmas decorations are
ready for the estimated 100,000 visitors who will troop through
over the next few weeks.
   ``It's ravishing,'' exclaimed Barbara Bush on Monday as she led
a preview tour of a White House brimming with garlands, bows,
poinsettias, 47 trees, 54,000 lights and even a sprig of mistletoe
above the Grand Staircase.
   President Bush complained of having ``a touch of the flu,'' but
he was host of a congressional ball for 700 guests Monday night.
The Bushes planned seven other Christmas parties over the next 10
days.
   Mrs. Bush had seen most of the decorations as they went up over
the weekend, with the help of 40 volunteers from the florist
industry and White House staff. Several grandchildren helped pelt
the trees with artificial snow.
   The Nutcracker ballet provides the theme this year, with the
official 18{-foot high Fraser fir tree in the Blue Room festooned
with porcelain dolls and beaded ballet slippers.
   Mrs. Bush also gave reporters a glimpse of the Bush's personal
Christmas tree, upstairs in their private quarters in the Yellow
Oval Room and filled with the family's own decorations.

   Hundreds of soldiers restricted to Fort
Sill are being ``adopted'' by local families who want to brighten
their holidays away from home.
   Darren Neal, a Fort Sill spokesman, said soldiers assigned to
the 2nd Battalion, 80th Field Artillery, have been restricted ``to
speed up readiness and training.'' Units based at this Army base in
southwest Oklahoma have been deployed to the Persian Gulf.
   ``Something needed to be done more than cookies and egg nog in
the rec room,'' said Diana Mercado, a former soldier who is married
to one of the battalion's drill sergeants.
   ``We have people picking them up in limos, we have people that
are going to take them out to a restaurant, we have a lady who's
going to take them horseback riding on her ranch,'' she said.
   Capt. Edward Solbach said more than 300 soldiers have received
sposors, and more volunteers are expected to sign up. The soldiers
will leave the base Christmas Eve or Christmas Day.
   ``It's kind of a pilot,'' said Solbach. ``It's the first time
we've done this. We're really the only battalion to be trying it.''
   Pvt. Terri Leach is spending her first Christmas away from her
home in Fryeburg.
   ``The morale here is pretty glum, but we're dealing with it,''
Ms. Leach said. ``Some of them are kind of hesitant (to be
adopted). I guess it really hasn't hit them that they're not going
home.''
   Jimmie Segraves, a widow whose husband served in the Marines
during World War II, plans to take four soldiers out to dinner and
give them care packages and T-shirts.
   ``I'm trying to carry out a theme to let these gentlemen know we
can't compare with their hometown...,'' Mrs. Segraves said. ``We

<TEXT>
   A woman whose surgeon later died of AIDS has
filed a $32 million lawsuit against the doctor's estate and Johns
Hopkins Hospital.
   The lawsuit filed Monday in Baltimore Circuit Court claims that
Dr. Rudolph Almaraz was obligated to tell patients of his disease
and that the hospital should have known he had the fatal virus.
   An identical claim was filed with the state Health Claims
Arbitration Office, which handles malpractice cases.
   The lawsuit is the first filed against Almaraz' estate and the
hospital since it was disclosed 1{ weeks ago that he died Nov. 16
of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Perry Mahoney Rossi and her husband, Dennis T. Rossi, seek a
total of $32 million in compensatory and punitive damages.
   In November 1989, Almaraz removed a non-malignant lump from Mrs.
Rossi's breast. She said she felt ``panic, horror and fear'' when
she learned the surgeon died of AIDS.
   ``I wish Dr. Almaraz had told me and I could have had the option
of walking out the door,'' Mrs. Rossi said. ``That's not the option
I was given. He took that choice away from me.''
   Mrs. Rossi has had an AIDS test but does not know the results.
   The hospital's attorney, Paul Rosenberg, refused to comment on
the lawsuit, saying he had not seen it.
   Almaraz's worked at the hospital for six years and performed
surgery on about 1,800 patients.
   The Rossis' lawyer, Jonathan Schochor, said the law requires
informed consent from a patient.
   ``The man was operating at this institution for years,''
Schochor said. ``In our opinion they should have known'' that he
had AIDS.
   Almaraz closed his practice last March and resigned from the
hospital June 30.
   His lawyer said Almaraz apparently contracted AIDS from one of
his patients.
   Almaraz's widow, Betty, said her husband took precautions to
avoid infecting his patients.
   Experts say the risk of doctors passing the virus on to their
patients is small.

   He knocked out Rocky Balboa on his debut, and
last weekend he shot down Clint Eastwood. The crafty little boy in
``Home Alone'' was the nation's favorite movie for the
fourth-straight weekend.
   ``Home Alone,'' starring Macaulay Culkin as an 8-year-old boy
abandoned by his family while burglars prowl outside, has earned
$84.2 million in a month. The year's biggest moneymaker, ``Ghost''
made $69 million in its first four weeks.
   The 20th Century Fox hit premiered the same weekend as ``Rocky
V,'' but outdid the heavyweight.
   Actor-director Clint Eastwood's police drama ``The Rookie''
fared no better last weekend, opening to a weak $5.5 million for
third place.
   That's three strikes for Eastwood this year. ``Pink Cadillac''
made just $12.1 million and ``White Hunter, Black Heart'' collected
$2.1 million.
   The film's poor opening leaves Warner Bros. two more chances
before Christmas, with ``The Sheltering Sky'' and ``Bonfire of the
Vanities.''
   ``Misery,'' adapted from the Stephen King novel by director Rob
Reiner and screenwriter William Goldman, took second place on the
charts with ticket sales of $7.1 million.
   ``The Rookie'' was third and actor Kevin Costner's directing
debut in ``Dances With Wolves'' claimed fourth with receipts of
$5.4 million.
   ``Three Men and a Little Lady'' fell 43 percent from the
previous weekend, collecting $4.6 million for fifth.
   The urban alien drama ``Predator II'' netted $2.1 million for
sixth and ``Rocky V'' was seventh on a disappointing $1.8 million.
   The latest ``Rocky'' sequel has grossed $34.7 million to date
and won't get far past $50 million before it disappears. ``Rocky
IV'' made $127.9 million and ``Rocky III'' took in $122.8 million.
   ``Ghost'' was eighth with ticket sales of $1.5 million and will
pass the $200 million mark this week. ``The Rescuers Down Under''
was ninth with $1.4 million and ``Child's Play 2'' took 10th with
$680,098.
   Here are the top movie ticket sales Friday through Sunday as
tallied by Exhibitor Relations, with distributor, weekend gross,
number of theater screens, average per screen, total gross and
number of weeks in release.
   Figures are based on a combination of actual box-office receipts
and studio projections where actual figures are not immediately
available.
   1. ``Home Alone,'' 20th Century Fox, $14.2 million, 1,764
screens, $8,068 per screen, $84.2 million, four weeks.
   2. ``Misery,'' Columbia, $7.1 million, 1,299 screens, $5,471 per
screen, $20.1 million, two weeks.
   3. ``The Rookie,'' Warner Bros., $5.5 million, 1,862 screens,
$2,959 per screen, $5.5 million, one week.
   4. ``Dances With Wolves,'' Orion, $5.4 million, 1,051 screens,
$5,124 per screen, $32 million, five weeks.
   5. ``Three Men and a Little Lady,'' Disney, $4.6 million, 1,282

   The dollar rebounded sharply against the yen in
Tokyo today, and share prices closed higher for the fifth
consecutive trading day.
   The dollar closed at 131.75 yen, up 1.20 yen from Monday's close
of 130.55 yen. After opening at 131.87 yen, it ranged between
131.30 yen and 132.07 yen. The dollar had plunged a total of 3.50
yen in the previous two trading days.
   Spot trading today amounted to $9.47 billion, down slightly from
Monday's 9.55 billion dollars.
   A trader at a major European bank said the yen suffered partly
from a rumor that the Bank of Japan might lower the official
discount rate, the interest it charges for loans to commercial
banks. Lower interest rates tend to make a currency less attractive
to investors.
   Continuing tensions in the Middle East also helped push the
dollar higher, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``The yen is basically weakening, especially toward the end of
the year, when there is a substantial increase in demand for the
dollar from travelers and trading houses,'' said Chizuko Satsukawa,
a dealer with Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   More than a million Japanese are expected to travel overseas for
the New Year holidays. Most of them buy dollars for their trips.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed
at 23,956.97 points, up 172.30 points or 0.72 percent.
   The Nikkei average now has gained 2,094.36 points in five
trading days.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 530 million shares,
up from 436.147 million Monday.
   Share prices rose Tuesday after an initial fall from
profit-taking, brokers said.
   Investment trusts established recently by major brokerage houses
were active buyers, they said.
   Market players feel the Nikkei average has bottomed out and is
now moving up to the 25,000-point level, a level it has not hit
since Oct. 31, said Toshinao Nakamura of Nomura Securities.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds rose to 87.95 points as of 5 p.m. (3 a.m.
EST) from Monday's 87.72-point close. Their yield fell to 7.070
percent from 7.120 percent.

<HEAD>Florida Man Hides with Dog in Kuwait; Another Kills Intruder with
Machete</HEAD>

   A Florida man trapped in Kuwait by Iraqi
invaders hid for 23 days with his dog in a tiny crawl space, eating
only uncooked spaghetti. A New Mexico man defended his hide-out
with a machete, killing an intruder.
   A freed Baltimore man told of watching a Kuwaiti man gunned down
by a platoon of Iraqi soldiers. The family of a Missouri man who
endured four months in hiding plans to burn his passport so he
can't leave the United States again.
   Tales of captivity ranged from those who cringed inside darkened
apartments in terror to a hostage held in a Kuwaiti royal palace
who ate off fine china and drank from gold-rimmed crystal goblets.
   Tom Kreuzman of Holiday, Fla., hid with his Yorkshire terrier,
Chu Chu, in an apartment air-conditioning duct about 8 feet long
and 3 feet wide for more than three weeks before Kuwaiti friends
moved him to a safe house.
   Kreuzman's homecoming joy Monday was tempered by sadness for the
dog that didn't make the flight home.
   ``It's a tragedy,'' he said. ``She went through a lot with me
over there.''
   He had crated his pet and put her on the plane in Kuwait. ``At
Baghdad I wanted to go down to cargo and give her some water but
was told no,'' said Kreuzman, 38. ``We got to Frankfurt, the box
was smashed and no dog was in sight.''
   Master and dog descended from the crawl space for only about
five minutes a day. Kreuzman never cooked, fearing the smell might
alert occupying troops. He said the dog never barked or made a fuss
that might give them away.
   Donald Latham, 50, of Albuquerque returned home with his
stepfather, Eugene Hughes, 69, after a harrowing stay in Kuwait
marked by the slaying of a burglar.
   ``We had a Palestinian break into our house, and I killed him
with a machete,'' Latham said.
   He said marauding Iraqi troops had entered the apartment earlier
but did not find the men. ``They stole our television, the blender,
one watermelon and about half our food,'' he said.
   The captives returned home after Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein
decided to release the many foreigners held since his forces
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   One man hiding in Kuwait experienced the carnage of war
firsthand.
   ``The worst thing I personally witnessed was a Kuwaiti being
shot by probably 20 Iraqi soldiers,'' said Ed Werner of Baltimore.
``The guy was crawling on the ground across the street, he fired a
shot, and about 20 Iraqi soldiers just opened up on him.''
   Stories of Iraqi soldiers torturing and murdering Kuwaitis were
common.
   ``I'm a veteran of Vietnam, but there's nothing in Vietnam that
scared me the way this did,'' said Robert Morris, a dentist from
Milton, Mass., who returned home Monday night. ``These people that
came down were barbarians.''
   ``They took everything. They pillaged the country, they raped
the women constantly ... they are killing the doctors,'' Morris
said.
   Jack Rinehart of Stover, Mo., who took refuge in the U.S.
Embassy in Kuwait, wasn't likely to travel abroad anytime soon.
   ``We're definitely going to have a passport-burning party. He's
not going to leave the good old U.S.A. again,'' said Rinehart's
sister, Sue Iliff of Stover.
   Robert Vinton, 58, of Santa Fe, N.M., was held as a human shield
at a petroleum refinery south of Baghdad and said conditions there
were like a prison camp, including barbed wire.
   ``We really couldn't leave,'' Vinton said. ``Basically we were
in a total prison with bars on the windows. They locked the doors
at night.''
   In a stark contrast to that isolated deprivation, Dave Lammel,
42, of Orinda, Calif., was held at a Kuwaiti royal family palace,
using the Limoges china and crystal glassware kept there.
   ``I had the irony of living in these ungodly opulent
conditions,'' he said. ``It was bizarre. It was like a Fellini
movie.''

   Third World countries' foreign debt rose to
$1.096 trillion this year, up from $1.051 trillion last year and
from $786 billion in 1984, the Central Intelligence Agency reports.
   The figure does not include the Soviet Union, China and other
countries either still under communist rule or emerging from it,
such as those in eastern Europe. Those countries add at least
another $210 billion, according to earlier estimates by the CIA and
the World Bank.
   The money is owed to more affluent governments including the
United States, Japan and West Germany, to their private commercial
banks and to intergovernmental bodies like the World Bank. Another
$29 billion owed to the International Monetary Fund is listed
separately.
   Although the CIA reported a rise of $45 billion in the debt
since last year, it showed that payments dropped to $122 billion
from the $126 billion of 1989.
   For the debtors the payment level is more important than debt
itself. Each dollar they save on payments to their creditors is a
dollar they can spend on new foreign goods.
   They can use foreign goods either to raise their people's living
standards or to invest in new equipment that will produce more
goods and jobs for their rapidly rising work force.
   The CIA handbook includes information compiled from the World
Bank and the International Monetary Fund in Washington, the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris and
the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland.
   The book consists only of tables and does not explain the rise
and fall of figures.
   Of the 113 countries listed, the heaviest debt is reported for
Brazil: $115.341 billion, up from $112.15 billion in 1989. Brazil
also owes about $8 billion in back interest, but the CIA does not
include such arrears in its figures. They show Brazil as paying
$10.1 billion on its debt this year, compared with $11.9 billion
last year and $16.1 billion the year before.
   The new government of President Fernando Collor de Mello is deep
in negotiations with private banks, to which it owes the bulk of
its debt. They are urging at least some payments on the back
interest.
   Mexico's debt of $88.02 billion is the second largest, reduced
under the plan of Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. Last year
it was $90.789 billion. Mexico's payments also have dropped due to
the new arrangement, to $10.06 billion this year from last year's
$13.104 billion.

<HEAD>Scholars Vote to Remove Chief Editor of Dead Sea Scrolls</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: To CORRECT that scrolls not found in present-day Israel, but
in occupied West Bank, SUB 5th graf, `The Dead ... in Jerusalem.'
^By AMY WESTFELDT</NOTE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The international team of editors deciphering the Dead Sea
Scrolls has voted to remove the project's chief editor, who has
been criticized for the slowness of the work to publish the ancient
documents, a team member said.
   The dismissal of John Strugnell of Harvard's Divinity School
comes just a month after the scholars appointed a co-chief editor
to share Strugnell's duties.
   The scholars voted last week to dismiss Strugnell because of
health problems for which he recently was hospitalized, Frank Cross
said Friday.
   Cross, of Harvard's Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations
department, belongs to the original group of eight scholars who
were given exclusive publishing rights to the scrolls in the 1950s.
The group has since been expanded to between 10 and 15 scholars
worldwide.
   The Dead Sea Scrolls, discovered in 1947 in a cave in what is
now the Israeli-occupied West Bank, contain the oldest known copies
of the Old Testament, other Biblical writings, ancient literature
and poetry. They are kept at the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem.
   Between 35 percent and 45 percent of the documents remain
unpublished, Strugnell said in a November interview.
   Strugnell has been ineffective as chief editor because he has
not pushed researchers to work faster so the scrolls can be
published in their entirety, Cross said in a telephone interview
last month.
   ``There has been criticism, both inside the team and out,''
Cross said in November. ``It is not by chance that this move is
being made.''
   Cross said Friday that Strugnell has been hospitalized, but was
unsure where.
   A Harvard spokesman Monday refused to disclose Strugnell's
whereabouts, saying Strugnell had instructed him not to speak to
anyone. Spokesman Peter Costa also said he didn't know if Strugnell
was aware of the vote to dismiss him.
   ``I can't confirm or deny anything,'' Costa said. ``At the
university we consider this to be private.'' He declined to
elaborate.
   Cross said Strugnell will remain in the group researching the
scrolls, but will no longer have administrative responsibilities.
   Three scholars in the team will replace Strugnell as general
editors, and Emmanuel Tov, of Jerusalem's Hebrew University, will
handle the project's administrative work, Cross said.
   The scholars in October chose Tov to become co-editor in chief
of the group deciphering the scrolls, hoping to speed up the work.

   Columbia glided to a rare
night landing a day early after a star-gazing mission plagued by
computer problems, clogged plumbing and finally the threat of rain.
   The shuttle touched down Monday night, its signature twin sonic
booms heralding its arrival over the Mojave Desert. The landing,
seen by about 600 spectators, was moved up to avoid rain in today's
forecast.
   NASA officials focused on the mission's accomplishments, despite
repeated problems aiming the $150 million Astro observatory.
Besides the telescope troubles, the crew had to repair a clog in
the shuttle's waste collection system.
   ``I think we've had a resounding success on the mission,'' said
William Lenoir, NASA associate administrator.
   It was the fourth shuttle landing at night.
   Columbia carried Astro, made up of three ultraviolet telescopes
and a separate X-ray telescope, in its payload bay.
   Problems with an automatic pointing system had forced astronauts
and ground crew to manipulate the ultraviolet telescopes by hand,
drastically slowing the process.
   During the nine-day mission, the crew succeeded in pointing the
ultraviolet telescopes at only 135 of 250 targets, including a
comet heading out of the solar system.
   The mission, originally scheduled for 1986, was delayed by the
Challenger explosion and later by repeated hydrogen fuel leaks.
   The landing came the same day the space agency received a
critical review by a government panel that said NASA should end its
dependence on the troubled space shuttle fleet and completely
redesign a planned space station.
   The Advisory Committee on the Future of the U.S. Space Program
also said NASA could improve by streamlining management.
   NASA assembled the outside review at the request of the Bush
administration after a rash of embarrassments that included the
grounding of the shuttle fleet because of hydrogen leaks and a
mirror flaw in the Hubble Space Telescope.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze toured the
Johnson Space Center in Houston space center on Monday with
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and spoke to the Columbia
crew in remarks translated from Russian.
   ``What you are doing in space is very important. You are paving
new roads in space, and I very much believe that you are paving
those roads for the benefit and for the happiness of all of us on
Earth,'' Shevardnadze said.
   Astronaut Jeffrey Hoffman responded with a few Russian phrases,
then said in English, ``We agree with your sentiments that space
travel is important for the future of all mankind.''
   NASA said it was the first communication between a Soviet
official and a shuttle crew in space.
   After the smooth landing, the seven Columbia astronauts were to
stay overnight at Edwards before traveling to Houston today.
   More than 1,000 telescope photographs were made during the
flight. The first photographs should be ready for viewing in late
December or January.
   NASA scientists were encouraged by the final observation made by
the ultraviolet telscopes, a study of Comet Levy. The comet could
not be studied earlier in the flight because it was too close to
the sun.
   ``What a thrilling way to go out,'' astronomer Paul Feldman of
Johns Hopkins University said. Mission scientist Ted Gull said,
``It brought tears to my eyes.''

   For four months, the priority has been freedom. Those trapped in
Kuwait and Iraq have above all focused on escaping with their
lives.
   But in the months to come, some of the 900 newly freed U.S.
hostages will have to start over without the homes, jobs and, in
some cases, friends they lost to Saddam Hussein's invading troops.
   ``It's not easy to pick up and start over like this,'' Patricia
Hammer said Monday from Denver. ``I'm 42 years old and living with
my mother.''
   Ms. Hammer fled Kuwait five weeks after Iraq invaded Aug.2, but
her ex-husband refused to let her take their two children. After
eight years building a life and family away from the United States,
she now feels very much alone.
   ``There's a lot of problems coming out,'' Ms. Hammer said.
``You're physically weak, emotionally upset. These people will be
traumatized ...''
   For many former hostages, the journey back to normalcy will not
end when they've arrived safely in America.
   ``My life is still not back together ... and it won't be for a
while,'' said Miles Hoffman, who was released last month after
being wounded by Iraqi troops.
   Hoffman has been in a perpetual rush since returning to
Columbus, Ga. His injured arm needed medical attention, the media
needed interviews, worried friends and relatives needed reassuring
and Kuwait still needs to be liberated.
   Hoffman and his British fiance, Nikki Murgatroyd, initially put
off their wedding until all Saddam Hussein's hostages were
released.
   ``Now she tells me she won't marry me as long as I'm married to
the Free Kuwait (effort),'' said Hoffman, a financial analyst for
the Kuwaiti government. ``I need time to catch up.''
   Hoffman, however, figures he may have it better than some of the
American hostages that were headed out of Iraq and Kuwait on
Monday, less than a week after Saddam decided to free his ``foreign
guests.''
   ``I have a sense of purpose ... and my job,'' Hoffman said.
``You just have to put your life in order and get on with it. The
thing is, some hostages are going to have a hard time doing that.''
   Some people lost it all when Iraq invaded Kuwait. Bob Peek, his
wife and children, like many of those who had established lives in
Kuwait, have had to start over from scratch.
   ``It's hard to imagine ... (that) all I had was my suitcase,''
said Peek, 37, who worked for the defense ministry in Kuwait. Left
behind were his family car, their entire household, souvenirs,
snapshots and a lot of Arab friends.
   Also left behind was their bank account.
   ``Getting back into the swing of the States isn't bad,'' said
Peek, who has moved his family to Midland, Texas, and started work
for a small oil company. ``The problem is that with the economy
being what it is today, it's hard to find something.
   ``After these people come home, after they've spent some time
with family and adjusted to their freedom, they're going to hit the
job market,'' he said. ``And I just wonder what they'll find.''
   Since fleeing Kuwait with her three young children, Ruthie
Al-Qallaf has traveled around the nation giving speeches on behalf
of Washington-based Citizens for a Free Kuwait.
   She is doing it to keep her mind occupied, to stave off her
despair at having lost everything. And she is doing it for her
husband, a Kuwaiti Air Force major. Iraqi troops had shot seven
members of his family by the time her husband, who is now in Saudi
Arabia, escaped in October.
   ``I'm bitter. I'm angry. I feel sad,'' Mrs. Al-Qallaf said from
Memphis, Tenn. ``(But) I've only lost my home. The Kuwaitis have
lost so much more.''

   For years, people erroneously thought
billionaire Armand Hammer was connected to the company that makes
Arm &amp; Hammer baking soda.
   Irked by the constant questions, Hammer finally worked out a
deal in 1986 that gave his Occidental Petroleum Corp. a 5 percent
stake in the baking soda company and him a seat on its board.
   Hammer often said he was named after Armand Duval, the hero in
``Camille,'' a play by Alexandre Dumas that was one of his father's
favorites.
   But he conceded in his autobiography that his father, a
socialist, probably also had in mind the arm-and-hammer symbol of
the Socialist Labor Party.

   The dollar was mixed against major foreign
currencies today in early European trading. Gold prices were
higher.
   Traders said the dollar is little changed, caught between fears
of war in the Middle East and expectations of lower U.S. interest
rates.
   The dollar, considered a safe have currency in times of trouble,
would rise if war broke out in the Gulf, traders said. But lower
U.S. interest rates make the dollar less attractive to foreign
investors and a drop in rates would bring a fall in the U.S.
currency, they said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 1.20 yen to a closing 131.75 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 131.95 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:
   -1.4725 German marks, up from 1.4708
   -1.2585 Swiss francs, down from 1.2610

   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.9455, up from

   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of
$374.30 per ounce at midmorning, up from $373.75 bid per ounce late

<HEAD>Critics Say Lame-duck Minnesota Governor is Pouting</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gov. Rudy Perpich was dubbed ``Governor
Goofy'' heading into his final year in office. Now, after his
re-election defeat, some see him as ``Governor Grumpy.''
   Perpich, 62, a Democrat, said there were no hard feelings after
he lost his bid for a fourth term, but since his defeat by
Gov.-elect Arne Carlson he has refused to talk to most news
reporters and skipped a ceremony for a state Supreme Court justice
he appointed.
   He has also written to Carlson criticizing the new governor's
leadership. ``If this was my child, I'd scold him,'' said state
Senate GOP Minority Leader Duane Benson, a chief Perpich foe.
   Perpich was tagged ``Governor Goofy'' about a year ago when he
responded to news media accounts of his lifestyle by proposing to
sell the governor's mansion, dismiss his State Patrol driver and
give up his luxury car.
   The governor lashed out at Carlson for his suggestion that
Perpich solve a projected $197 million state budget shortfall and
help ease a projected $1.2 billion deficit in the next two-year
budget.
   ``You have hired only one staff person and are relying on
lame-duck administrators to make your decisions,'' Perpich wrote in
one of three letters to Carlson. ``That's not the type of
leadership most Minnesotans were looking for during the recent
election.''
   Perpich missed the swearing-in ceremony for Supreme Court Chief
Justice A.M. ``Sandy'' Keith on Nov. 30. His absence was striking
because he had named Keith, a longtime friend, to the high court
and last summer selected him to become chief justice.
   Keith said the governor had called him shortly after the
election to complain about a Supreme Court decision Perpich said
led to his defeat.
   The 5-2 ruling, with Keith in the majority, cleared the way five
days before the election for Carlson to replace Jon Grunseth as the
GOP candidate on the ballot. Sexual impropriety allegations forced
Grunseth from the race.
   Perpich spokesman Ray Bohn said the governor missed Keith's
swearing-in ceremony because he had previous commitments.
   Some Perpich allies said the governor is handling his defeat
well. Retiring Minnesota AFL-CIO President Dan Gustafson said he's
spoken with Perpich a couple of times since the election.
   ``He hasn't been bitter,'' Gustafson said. ``He's been a little
hurt, and naturally so. This is a real tender guy and he's never
been vindictive. That doesn't mean he can't get mad and angry.''

rainfall in the Northern Rockies.
   Fair skies prevailed throughout much of the nation, with
forecast highs ranging from the teens in northern Maine to the 70s
in southern Florida, Texas, Arizona and southeastern California.
   The wet weather was welcome in northern and central California,
where drought conditions have persisted for several years, although
rainfall was not expected to be especially heavy today.
   Rain also fell in Seattle and Boise, Idaho, with some scattered
snow at higher elevations along Montana's eastern border with
Idaho. Highs in the 30s were expected in New York and Boston.
   The high temperature for the nation Monday was 85 degrees at
Imperial Beach, Calif.

<HEAD>Tamil Rebels Claim 76 Men Massacred by Soldiers and Rival Tamils</HEAD>

   The Tamil Tiger rebel group has
accused government troops and members of a rival Tamil group of
dragging 76 Tamil men out of their cars and homes and massacring
them in eastern Sri Lanka.
   Military officials and a spokesman for the rival group denied
the allegation today, but residents of a nearby town said they had
heard reports of a massacre from people who fled the area.
   The residents, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they
were told some people had been shot to death while others were
burned alive with blazing tires around their necks.
   In another development, military officials said the Tigers had
ambushed a military patrol today near the northeastern port of
Trincomalee, killing five ethnic Sinhalese soldiers.
   Some rebels were thought to have died in the 90-minute gunbattle
that followed the ambush, the officials said. They gave no numbers.
   The Tigers, in a statement issued by their office in London late
Monday night, claimed ``a terrible massacre'' was carried out
Friday by Sri Lankan army troops from an army camp at Neelavenai.
   The Tigers accused a rival group, the Tamil Eelam Liberation
Organization, of collaborating in the alleged massacre.
   Military officials in Colombo denied their men were responsible
for any such killings.
   The officials said the Tigers often made such statements in an
attempt to justify upcoming attacks on the army or Sinhalese
civilians.
   Tamil guerrillas launched a violent separatist campaign against
the country's Sinhalese ethnic majority and Sinhalese-controlled
government in 1983. More than 14,000 people have died during the
insurgency.
   The Tigers statement claimed 76 Tamil men were killed at
Neelavenai, 9 miles south of the eastern coastal town of
Batticaloa. The statement listed names and ages of 14 purported
victims but gave no details of the others it alleged were killed.
   Senathirajah Lawrence, spokesman for the Tamil Eeelam Liberation
Organization, denied his group had anything to do with a massacre.
   Lawrence's group was once allied with the Tigers, but says its
men have given up armed struggle in favor of a political solution.
   ``We don't operate anywhere near the Neelavenai village,''
Lawrence said when contacted by telephone in Colombo. ``This is a
canard spread by the (Tigers).''
   Residents of Batticaloa, 135 miles east of Colombo, said Tamils
who fled Neelavenai reported that about 70 people were killed. The
residents, contacted by telephone, said they were not sure who was
responsible.
   The Tigers broke a cease-fire with the government six months
ago. After several offensives, the government controls Batticaloa
and other major towns in the east. The Tigers still operate in the
jungles and are in control of the northern Jaffna Peninsula.
   The Tigers say Sri Lanka's Tamil minority needs a separate
homeland to protect it from discrimination by the Sinhalese in jobs
and education. Sinhalese make up 75 percent of the island nation's
16 million people.

<TEXT>
   After suffering a bruising defeat in
national elections, the leadership of the opposition Social
Democrats has unanimously chosen the premier of a northern state to
be the party's new chairman.
   The nomination of Bjoern Engholm ended a week-long search for a
new leader to renew the party, which has been dealt three
successive electoral defeats at the hands of Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's Christian Democrats.
   Both chancellor candidate Oskar Lafontaine and current party
chief Hans-Jochen Vogel had declined to lead the Social Democrats
after the defeat in the Dec. 2 parliamentary vote.
   The Social Democrats are the country's second largest political
force and the oldest political party in Germany.
   But with Lafontaine as chancellor candidate and Vogel at the
head of the party, they won just 33.5 percent of the vote
nationwide in the first free elections in united Germany in 58
years.
   The left-leaning party fared poorly, winning about 23 percent,
in the five new eastern states that were carved out of East Germany
following unity on Oct. 3.
   The cautious, 51-year-old Engholm, dubbed ``the beautiful
Bjoern'' for his dapper dressing, is a study in contrast with the
harsh, outspoken Lafontaine.
   As Kohl's push for speedy German unity accelerated this year,
Lafontaine alienated voters by issuing negative statements about
unity. Engholm said he found Lafontaine's style off-putting.
   Engholm told ZDF television his task would be to bring the
Social Democrats back to the center of society. He said that he
would consult with leading artists and intellectuals on the party's
future course.
   Engholm indicated he would retain his elected office as premier
of Germany's northernmost state, largely rural Schleswig-Holstein.
   Vogel said the party leadership had unanimously agreed on
Engholm's nomination as chairman. The candidacy must be formally
approved at a party congress scheduled for May. Lafontaine has
remained out of view since losing the election.
   Engholm said he wanted to bring a new generation of Social
Democratic politicians to the forefront in time for 1994
parliamentary elections.
   An education minister under the former West German government of
Helmut Schmidt, he has already proven his own electoral resilience.
   In 1987, Engholm was the victim of a smear campaign while
running for premier of Schleswig-Holstein.
   Christian Democrat Uwe Barschel won the vote but resigned 12
days later after an aide revealed he was ordered to leak claims
that Engholm cheated on his taxes and was bisexual.
   A day before Barschel was to have appeared before an
investigatory panel, he was found dead in a Geneva hotel, an
apparent suicide.
   Engholm was elected state premier in new elections on May 1988.

<HEAD>San Francisco Supervisors Tentatively Approve VDT Safety Rules</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA MYERS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city's Board of Supervisors has given
initial approval to what could become the nation's only active law
regulating video display terminals in the workplace.
   The measure tentatively approved Monday would require employers
with 15 or more employees to provide adjustable work stations,
mandatory 15 minute breaks and safety education for workers.
   Private and government offices would have two years to comply
with the VDT safety rules if the ordinance is approved a second
time by the supervisors and signed by Mayor Art Agnos.
   ``This is the new age of safety and health legislation,'' said
Supervisor Nancy Walker.
   She compared the VDT safety ordinance to landmark laws at the
turn of the century that set work standards such as eight-hour days
and compensation for overtime.
   ``We are once again on the cutting edge of something that others
have been unable to do,'' she added. ``And we're taking heat from
that.''
   The only other such ordinance, in Suffolk County, N.Y., was
successfully challenged by business owners who said only the state
could impose such rules.
   The San Francisco ordinance passed 8-1. Supervisor Tom Hsieh
cast the lone dissenting vote, saying it was too costly and more
information on VDT problems should be gathered.
   The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health said
VDT workers often suffer headaches, general malaise, eye strain and
musculoskeletal problems caused by poor work station design that
results in awkward hand, head and limb positions.
   Pacific Bell operator Becky Hogue, who wears wrist braces, said
repetitive strain injuries cause debilitating pain.
   `It's been frustrating because my bosses basically don't believe
I'm hurting,'' said Hogue, 30. ``Maybe this ordinance will force
people to do something they should be doing anyway.''
   Under the ordinance, VDT operators would get a 15-minute break
every two hours. Work stations would have to have proper artificial
lighting and be out of direct sunlight. Adjustable swivel chairs
and document holders must be provided. Computer terminals would
have to have detachable keyboards and adjustable, non-glare
screens, among other safety features.
   Additionally, businesses would have to provide workers, at their
request, with arm, wrist and foot rests that aid in proper
placement of limbs and joints while working on a VDT.
   Jim Lazarus, vice president of the San Francisco Chamber of
Commerce, said the business group opposes the ordinance because it
would cost too much to comply ``especially during an economic
downturn.''
   City budget analysts estimate it would cost San Francisco about
$1.6 million to retrofit VDT work stations. Private businesses
would probably pay some $36 million to comply with the ordinance,
they said.

<HEAD>Survey Finds Strong Smoking-Leukemia Link</HEAD>

   Cigarette smoking appears to increase the
risk of developing leukemia, and kicking the habit may not be
enough to dodge the dreaded blood disease, a study says.
   Paul K. Mills, a professor at Loma Linda University and the
principal author of the study, said research suggests that even
former smokers are at high risk.
   ``It's very discouraging,'' Mills said Monday. ``We saw a strong
association between prior cigarette smoking and the risk of
developing leukemia.''
   The study's results are being published this month in the
Journal of the National Cancer Institute.
   Cigarette smoking also has been linked to cancers of the lung,
bladder, pancreas, esophagus, throat and cervix.
   The study is part of the Adventist Health Study, a major
epidemiological investigation of the causes of various cancers
among California members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. About
34,000 Adventists responded to the study.
   Although the vast majority of Adventists do not smoke by church
proscription, many are adult converts to the religion who smoked
cigarettes prior to their baptism into the church.
   The researchers found that the ex-smokers had twice the risk of
developing leukemia than non-smokers.
   For people who regularly smoked more than 25 cigarettes a day,
the risk of developing leukemia increased threefold. The Adventists
who had smoked for more than 15 years had a 2{-fold increased
leukemia risk.
   Leukemia is a bone marrow cancer in which the marrow is replaced
by immature, abnormal white blood cells. The disease kills 18,000
people a year in the United States.
   Dr. Clark Heath Jr. of the American Cancer Society said the
causes of leukemia are largely unknown.
   But several studies in recent years, including a large study of
U.S. military veterans, have suggested smoking as a cause, he said.
   The Loma Linda study estimates that about 20 percent of leukemia
cases were linked to smoking.

<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino's efforts to
cope with rising oil costs have produced bizarre flip-flops on
price policy, street protests and calls for her resignation from
former supporters.
   The increases, which raised fuel prices more than 45 percent,
stunned the middle class, which had been a pillar of her support.
Her handling also reinforced an image of a detached president,
unsure of power after nearly five years in office.
   On Monday, militant transport workers staged a one-day strike in
Manila, Cebu and other major cities. About 6,000 people rallied in
Manila against the increases, and smaller protests took place in
many provincial cities.
   Hundreds of commuters were stranded in the southern Philippines
today as transport workers continued a strike to protest the
increase in fuel prices.
   Protest leaders included several former Aquino government
appointees and veterans of the struggle that toppled the late
President Ferdinand Marcos and propelled Mrs. Aquino to power in
February 1986.
   Many of them demanded she resign.
   It all started Wednesday when the Energy Regulatory Board raised
prices for all grades of petroleum, including a more than 70
percent hike for gasoline.
   Board Chairman Marcello Fernando said the government could no
longer subsidize consumer prices due to the rise in crude oil
prices that occurred after Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   The increases had been expected for weeks. But their magnitude
stunned Filipinos already coping with 12 percent inflation.
   Within hours of the announcement, Mrs. Aquino went on national
television to ask the board to reduce the increase for kerosene and
cooking fuel, widely used by the poor.
   The following day, the board dutifully complied but boosted
prices again for gasoline. Premium prices soared by more than 130
percent over the level of the previous week.
   That effectively priced gasoline beyond the budgets of many
teachers, government employees and managers of small businesses.
   ``The decision to raise fuel prices...starts the process of
pauperizing the middle class,'' wrote commentator Amando Doronila
in The Manila Chronicle. ``A government installed by middle class
disenchantment is in danger of losing its legitimacy...''
   Government officials then launched a campaign of leaks and
off-the-record briefings in an effort to persuade the public that
Mrs. Aquino was unaware of the size of the increases.
   They blamed her executive secretary, Catalino Macaraig, for not
informing the president. On Monday, the government announced that
Macaraig had been replaced by the youthful, popular transport
secretary, Oscar Orbos, who was said to have opposed the increases.
   Critics said that if Mrs. Aquino was unaware of the increases,
she was derelict in her duty. If she was informed, then she
deceived the public.
   Four of the 23 senators called for her resignation or shortening
her term through rewriting the constitution. Three of the four were
elected in 1987 on the administration ticket.
   As criticism mounted, Mrs. Aquino appeared again on television
Sunday and suggested that gasoline prices be reduced to Wednesday's
level.
   The board then canceled the second gasoline increase, fixing the
price at 57 cents a liter ($2.17 per gallon) for premium and 54
cents a liter for regular.
   Although the government blames the increase on the Persian Gulf
crisis, pressure has been mounting for more than a year to end
price subsidies on fuel.
   In March 1989, the government promised the International
Monetary Fund that it would raise fuel prices regularly to curb the
deficit in the Oil Price Stabilization Fund, which subsidized
consumer prices.
   But the government, fearful of domestic unrest if prices rose,
continued subsidizing the fund, whose deficit grew to $393 million.
   Last month, the government promised the IMF again that it would
reduce the deficit in hopes of receiving new loans. It hoped to
eliminate the stabilization fund deficit in one bold move.
   ``They tried to correct two years of procrastination
overnight,'' wrote columnist Pedro Chanco in the newspaper Malaya.
``That simply can't be done without causing massive disruptions in
the lives of people.''

   President Slobodan Milosevic and his
renamed Communists today swept toward a resounding victory in
elections that placed Serbia squarely at odds with the two other
leading Yugoslav republics.
   The opposition conceded defeat Monday in Yugoslavia's most
populous republic as Milosevic took a nearly 4-to-1 lead over Vuk
Draskovic, leader of the nationalist Serbian Renewal Movement.
   ``Serbia chose Bolshevism and darkness instead of democracy and
light,'' thundered Draskovic, a shaggy-bearded, pro-capitalist
novelist who described the campaign as a contest between the forces
of good and evil.
   ``I don't want and I don't belong to that kind of Serbia,'' he
said.
   Opposition parties accused the ruling Socialists of vote fraud,
and foreign observers said they were concerned that the republic's
Communist-controlled media may have unfairly influenced the outcome
of Sunday's vote.
   In the neighboring republic of Montenegro, Yugoslavia's
smallest, the Communists were also celebrating victory.
   By contrast, the nationalist VMRO party won a plurality over the
Communists in a third and final round of voting in the poorest
southern state of Macedonia. The party, which advocates Macedonia's
full sovereignty, won 37 seats and their closest rivals, the
reformed Communists, 30 seats in the 120-seat Macedonian
parliament, according to final results made public today.
   The future shape of Macedonia's government is still unclear.
   Milosevic's victory in Serbia threatened to deepen rifts between
it and the Western-minded republics of Croatia and Slovenia, which
ousted Communists from power in elections this spring.
   The Croats and Slovenes want to transform Yugoslavia into a
loose confederation from what they claim is a Serbian-dominated
federation.
   Milosevic has slapped duties on Slovenian and Croatian goods in
reprisal for their steps toward independence.
   If Croatia secedes, Milosevic says, he will expand Serbia's
borders to protect about 500,000 ethnic Serbs living there.
   The state news agency Tanjug said based on a partial count,
Milosevic's Socialists, formerly Communists, won about 60 percent
of the 250 assembly seats in the republic.
   With about 25 percent of the vote counted, Milosevic had 62
percent to 17 percent for Draskovic. Milosevic's Socialists had 43
percent in the race for the parliament to 15 percent for
Draskovic's party.
   The opposition accused the government of rigging the vote, but
acknowledged on Monday that Milosevic would have won anyway.
   State television and newspapers in Belgrade, the national as
well as Serbian capital, were unabashedly pro-Milosevic. Opposition
figures were given little coverage or portrayed as traitors whose
victory could lead to civil war.
   ``In terms of procedures at individual voting places, the
elections passed fairly well,'' said Robert Hand, a monitor from
the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. ``Our main
concern is what happened before the elections.''
   There was little voting in the republic's troubled Kosovo
province, where the ethnic Albanian majority staged a boycott to
protest Serbian measures that have deprived the region of
self-rule.
   There has been no parliament, government or Albanian-language
media operating in Kosovo since July 5.
   Milosevic's actions there drew the repudiation of leaders from
the rest of the republic, as did a bill he pushed through
parliament stipulating prison sentences for people slandering the
president.
   Yugoslavia was founded as a kingdom of Serbs, Croats and
Slovenes in 1918 and reformed as a Communist republic during World
War II.
   It has traditionally been a volatile amalgam of squabbling
nationalities and ethnic groups. The split between the politically
center-right north and the less-developed Communist south now
threatens to break the country apart.
   Slovenia, the most western-leaning of the Yugoslav republics,
lying on the Italian border, will vote in a referendum Dec. 23 on
whether to become fully independent.
   Yugoslavia's pro-Communist defense secretary, Gen. Veljko
Kadijevic, a Serb, has threatened army intervention to protect the
federation's unity.

   The premiers of North and South Korea
clapped and sang Korea's national anthem for unification today in
an emotional ceremony preceding another round of talks on easing 40
years of confrontation.
   North Korean Premier Yon Hyong Muk and his South Korean
counterpart, Kang Young-hoon, stood side by side in an auditorium
filled with 2,000 cheering spectators and sang the song, which
starts, ``Our wish is unification.''
   ``The music hall turned into a chamber of unification fever,''
said one witneses. ``The delegates sang, the premiers sang,
everyone sang - the whole song twice.''
   Yon arrived in South Korea earlier in the day for the third
round of high-level talks. Controversy flared almost immediately.
   In a statement, Yon's delegation said it was pessimistic about
the parley and criticized Seoul for jailing three dissidents.
   The three were arrested Nov. 30 after they returned home from
meeting North Koreans in Berlin to discuss Korean unification. The
Seoul government maintains that dialogue on unification must be
conducted through official channels.
   ``The time when discussion of unification is monopolized by
certain people is over,'' said An Byong Su, a North Korean
spokesman. ``We are concerned about the reality in which civilians
cannot meet in their own land or travel to an alien land for
meeting.''
   ``Issues which do not fall within the purview of the talks
should not be raised,'' countered Kim Hyung-gi, of South Korea's
Unification Board.
   The talks, to conclude Thursday, are the third round since
October and the highest-level meetings between the Koreas since the
peninsula was divided in 1945 and the border tightly sealed.
   In neither of the two countries is the premier the
highest-ranking official. Kim Il Sung is the north's authoritarian
leader, Roh Tae Woo the elected president of the south.
   South Korean Premier Kang Young-hoon greeted North Korean
Premier Yon at a Seoul hotel. Kang denied news reports that he was
planning to retire after the talks finish.
   ``The media may be asking me to resign because I did not manage
south-north dialogue properly,'' Kang told Yon. ``I think I can
stay in this position only with your help.''
   The premiers attended an afternoon of traditional music.
Afterward, the delegates stood and sang a song which begins: ``Our
wish is unification.''
   The talks will deal with visitor exchanges and easing political
and military tensions between the two countries. North Korea seeks
a non-aggression pact but the south claims confidence-building
agreements are needed first.
   No major agreement is expected, but the talks are seen as one
more step in the lengthy process of drawing the two nations closer.
   North Korea is one of the world's few remaining tightly
controlled Communist states, with everything revolving Kim Il Sung.
South Korea, while still emerging from decades of military control,
has a functioning democracy.
   ``Small, steady efforts and finally little gains ... will lead
to quantitative change,'' said Limb Dong-won, a diplomat and
spokesman for the south's delegation.
   ``We will positively study any North Korean proposals,'' he told
a news briefing.
   Roh is flying to Moscow this week for a summit with President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and says he will discuss improving relations
on the peninsula.
   North Korea has bitterly criticized Roh's visit, claiming it
would sabotage the dialogue between two Koreas. North Korea was a
close Soviet ally before the end of the Cold War.

   As scores of Iraqi hostages joyfully returned
home, former hostage Frank Reed implored the nation not to forget
the 13 Westerners still held in Lebanon.
   ``Terry Anderson has now gone through his sixth Thanksgiving and
(is) heading for a sixth Christmas,'' Reed told 100 people gathered
Monday night to honor Anderson and the other hostages.
   ``Tom Sutherland is heading for his sixth Christmas. What price
must these men pay for being innocent people who went to do a job
and had every right to be there?''
   Reed, who lives in suburban Malden, spoke at the second annual
``Celebration of Hope'' sponsored by Emerson College's Society of
Professional Journalists and the Free Terry Anderson Committee. The
ceremony marked Anderson's 2,096th day of captivity.
   Anderson, 43, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, and Sutherland, 59, acting dean of agriculture at the
American University of Beirut, are the longest held of the
hostages. Most of them are believed in the hands of Shiite factions
of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   The other Americans still held include Joseph Cicippio, 59,
acting comptroller at the American University in Beirut; Ewward
Tracy, 59, West Beirut resident; Alann Steen, 51, a communications
instructor at Beirut University College; and Jesse Turner, 42,
professor of mathematics and computer science at Beirut University
College.
   As each hostage's name was read by students representing them,
tears welled in Reed's eyes. His was one of the names read in his
absence during the first ``Celebration of Hope'' a year ago. No
hostages have been freed since the 58-year-old educator was
released last April 30 after 44 months in captivity.
   ``People ask me how good it is to be free,'' Reed said. ``And
I'm not sure that I am free. I'm reminded every single day about
the people I left behind.''

   Police said today they had orders to
arrest ousted President Hussain Muhammad Ershad, and a dozen senior
officials from his government were being sought by authorities. One
was put under house arrest.
   A senior police official said he expected Ershad to be detained
by Wednesday. Other officials said the order could be carried out
today.
   The police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the former home minister, Mahmudul Hassan, had been put under house
arrest. The police official said policemen raided a dozen other
homes, looking for senior officials of Ershad's ousted government.
   As home minister, Mahmudul was in charge of the police and the
paramilitary Bangladesh Rifles, which were held responsible for the
deaths of about 100 people during the seven weeks of unrest aimed
at forcing Ershad to resign.
   Ershad, facing unrelenting public pressure and the refusal of
his army to support him any longer, handed over power last week to
the Supreme Court chief justice, Shahabuddin Ahmed, as acting
president.
   In another development, the caretaker administration moved today
to drastically toughen the punishment for illegal possession of
weapons, raising the maximum sentence from three years to life in
prison.
   The order signaled that the interim government intends to act
harshly against anyone trying to disrupt parliamentary elections,
which are to be held within three months.
   Opposition parties, under pressure from radical university
students who spearheaded the anti-Ershad campaign, have urged that
the ousted president be tried on charges of corruption and abuse of
power during his eight-year rule.
   The opposition has called for three days of demonstrations to
back up their demand for his arrest and trial.
   Ershad seized power in a bloodless coup in 1982 and ruled under
martial law for four years. He was widely accused of fixing two
parliamentary elections, and won a presidential election in 1986
against token opposition.
   Shahabuddin, the acting president, has sounded out the
opposition parties on the possibility of allowing Ershad to flee
the country to avoid a trial.
   For the most part, the parties publicly opposed the idea. But
Sheik Hasina, leader of one of the anti-Ershad alliances, left the
door open for exile.
   ``We want a Bangladesh without Ershad. I don't mind if that is
achieved by his arrest and trial or by throwing him out of the
country,'' she told reporters today.
   On Monday, a mob attacked the home of Ershad's vice president,
Moudad Ahmed, with crude bombs, causing some damage. Moudud was not
home and no one was injured. Moudud has denied any wrongdoing and
said Ershad's Jatiya party intended to contest the parliamentary
elections.
   Shahabuddin, meanwhile, told the military not to interfere in
the elections. ``The nation expects law enforcing agencies,
including the armed forces, to exercise complete neutrality in
helping conduct free and fair polls,'' United News of Bangladsh
quoted him as telling army officers.
   The army traditionally plays a strong role in politics in
Bangladesh. Most of the presidents Bangladesh has had since
independence in 1971 were former generals or were installed by the
military.

<HEAD>Sarbanes Admits Borrowing Remarks of Historian</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Paul Sarbanes has admitted borrowing some
remarks from Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Arthur Schlesinger
while challenging the Bush administration's Persian Gulf policies.
   Sarbanes, D-Md., said Monday he should have credited
Schlesinger, a former White House adviser to President Kennedy,
last Wednesday when he disputed President Bush's conclusion that he
alone had the anguish of deciding whether to send young soldiers to
battle.
   Both Sarbanes and Schlesinger spoke on the subject at Senate
Foreign Relations Committee hearings last week - Schlesinger on
Tuesday and Sarbanes a day later.
   A review of transcripts of their remarks shows Sarbanes, a
committee member, borrowed Schlesinger's comments without crediting
him.
   In his statement, Schlesinger said:
   ``I notice the president in his moving remarks last Friday about
the anguish of sending young kids to war, said, `It's only the
president that should be asked to make the decision.' I hope he
will reconsider that remark. If anything is clear about the
original intent of the Constitution, it is that, as Abraham Lincoln
said, the Constitution was written precisely to ensure that `no one
man should hold the power of bringing this oppression upon us.'''
   The following day, in questioning Secretary of State James Baker
III before the same committee, Sarbanes said:
   ``The president, in fact, said, in a moving statement, when he
spoke about his concern about committing American men to war, said,
and I quote him, `It's only the president that should be asked to
make the decision.' I would hope the president would reconsider
that remark, because I think if anything is clear about the
Constitution, it is that, as Abraham Lincoln said, `The
constitution was written precisely to ensure that no one man should
hold the power of bringing this oppression on us.'''
   ``I should have probably said, `As Dr. Schlesinger pointed out
to our committee yesterday,''' Sarbanes said Monday.
   ``I'm perfectly happy to accede to the fact that what I used
came from Dr. Schlesinger,'' Sarbanes said.
   Sarbanes said he delivered his remarks without a prepared text
and drew in part from other congressional testimony that he had
heard or read.

   The Soviet Union is backing Secretary of State
James A. Baker III's timetable for his mission to Baghdad, and a
U.S.-Soviet agreement may be near for both powers to end weapons
shipments to rival factions in Afghanistan.
   The two cooperative moves surfaced as Baker and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze resume their drive for a new treaty
to trim U.S. and Soviet nuclear weapons stocks.
   ``Bridges are being built,'' a Soviet official said Monday night
after Baker and Shevardnadze discussed the unsettled issues for 3{
hours.
   Neither side claimed real headway on completing the Strategic
Arms Reduction Treaty, which would require a cut of about 30
percent in long-range nuclear bombers, missiles and submarines.
   Baker and Shevardnadze fly to Washington tonight and will report
the results of their talks to President Bush on Wednesday.
   Once the treaty is completed, Bush and Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev are expected to set the date for a treaty-signing at a
summit meeting in Moscow.
   On three other fronts there was marked progress toward closer
ties.
   Baker offered sympathetic consideration Monday to any Soviet
request for emergency food and medical supplies.
   Shevardnadze, his country staggering on the edge of economic
disintegration, said ``we would appreciate it.''
   Also, the Soviet foreign minister appeared to credit reports
that his government would suspend weapons shipments to the
pro-Moscow regime in Afghanistan while the Bush administration
ceases arming a coalition of rebels.
   That could end the decade-old war in the Southwest Asian
country.
   ``We'll reach agreement on Afghanistan tomorrow,'' Shevardnadze
told reporters.
   On Iraq, the Soviet foreign minister backed Baker's stand on
going to Baghdad for talks with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   Baker has rejected an Iraqi proposal that he go to Baghdad on
Jan. 12, only three days before the United Nations Security
Council's deadline for Iraq to leave Kuwait or face a forcible
eviction.
   Baker said Sunday he ``won't be a party to playing games that
back us up to that deadline.'' He proposed going to Baghdad to see
Saddam either Dec. 20-22 or on Jan. 3.
   At Baker's meeting Monday with Shevardnadze, a senior Soviet
official said, ``the foreign minister reiterated his support, his
understanding of that schedule.''
   The Soviets - who sent Yevgeny Primakov, their top expert on the
Persian Gulf, to Baghdad on two futile missions - do not plan to
send an emissary there ``for the time being,'' the Soviet official
said.
   Shevardnadze's support, and deferral of any new Soviet overtures
to Saddam, strengthens the united stand taken by the two
superpowers against Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   The Washington Post today quoted Soviet sources as saying Baker
asked Shevardnadze to commit a token Soviet military force to the
gulf, but that Shevardnadze refused. A U.S. official disputed the
account, saying that while Baker and Shevardnadze had discussed
sending such a force in past meetings, the subject had not come up
in their talks here.
   Baker's trip to Iraq could be the last opportunity for Iraq to
yield to international demands for a pullout before facing an
attack.
   Meanwhile, a U.S. official, who also spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the Iraqi government had not responded to Baker's
rejection of the Jan. 12 proposal.

<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle said today that
congressional inaction on the Persian Gulf crisis sends a message
of support for President Bush's policy against Iraq. But he accused
some Democrats of playing politics with the situation.
   ``They passed resolutions before they left and they've done
nothing to change those resolutions, so therefore our
interpretation is support,'' Quayle told reporters at the
Republican Governors Conference.
   He said the White House would like Congress, now in recess, to
adopt a favorable resolution, but that's not likely. He did not
call for a special session, saying that is for congressional
leaders to decide.
   Lacking a new endorsement measure, he said, silence equals
support.
   The resolutions he cited were adopted by the House and Senate in
October, endorsing administration policy at that time. That
preceded Bush's decision to double the American force deployed
against Iraq and open the possibility of offensive action to drive
Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait.
   Quayle said congressional hearings on the crisis permitted
Democrats ``the luxury of criticism without the burden of
accountability.''
   He would not identify Democrats he said had attempted to use the
crisis ``for partisan political advantage.''
   ``I'm not getting into names at all,'' he said today when asked
whether he was criticizing Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Committee, the panel that held the initial
hearings hearings he criticized.
   ``Congress has not even sworn in its new members, yet already
it's playing politics,'' he told Republican governors on Monday.
The GOP governors conference was winding up today with an appraisal
of the Nov. 6 elections and a look at the next campaign by
pollsters and party leaders.
   The vice president told the governors he is confident
Republicans will be united behind Bush in 1992.
   ``When the president unveils our agenda, I am certain it will
rally our troops and unify our growing, yet at times contentious,
Republican Party,'' Quayle said in a reference to in-house GOP
debate over the best way to shape and deliver future government
programs.
   ``Once the president decides, it will not be Republicans vs.
Republicans, but Republicans vs. Democrats,'' Quayle said. ``The
election cycle of 1992 is already upon us. The battle for this
decade's political agenda has certainly begun.''
   Quayle complained that the first three witnesses before the
Senate Armed Services Committee early this month all were critical
of Bush policy. Nunn, chairman of that committee, is a fixture on
the list of potential Democratic challengers for the White House.
Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., who sought the nomination in 1988
and says he is considering it again, is a committee member.
   They have been among the critics of Bush's decision to double
the U.S. force arrayed against Iraq, opening the possibility of
offensive action to drive Saddam Hussein out of occupied Kuwait.
   Democratic congressional leaders decided on hearings instead of
calling Congress back into session to consider legislation on U.S.
policy. Bush had said that was alright with him. He also has said
he would welcome congressional backing for his course. Quayle told
the governors the prospect of recalling Congress posed a dilemma
because ``there is no perceived consensus.''
   ``I cannot predict with any certainty what they will do when
they get back in January,'' he said.
   Retired military and government officials at the Armed Services
Committee hearings and at companion hearings of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee recommended a go-slow course in the gulf
crisis, one in which the U.S.-led alliance against Saddam Hussein
would wait for economic sanctions to take their full toll on Iraq.
   But Quayle said waiting 12 to 18 months would be unacceptable.
   ``Patience at any price would be a failed policy,'' he said,
amounting to appeasement of Saddam. Quayle said the Iraqi president
is trying to use Congress and American public opinion in ``a
political war'' to deprive the administration of its option to use
force.
   It won't work, he said, because ``despite the efforts of some in
Congress, the fact of the matter is that the American people
support the president.'' Quayle added that in the end, ``when
America's vital interests are on the line, the majority of Congress
can rise above partisan politics.''
   But he argued that is not happening now.
   ``A Congress solidly united behind the president would
strengthen the chances for peace,'' Quayle said.
   ``Unfortunately, by portraying themselves as the party of peace,
and the administration as the party of war, some congressional
Democrats - but by no means all congressional Democrats - seem to
have placed partisanship above statesmanship,'' he said.

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Ion Iliescu, attempting to
stave off a nationwide strike that could bring down the government,
opened crisis talks today with government and union leaders.
   The unions threatened a nationwide work stoppage if Premier
Petre Roman did not step down by this evening. The labor groups say
Roman's economic reforms have lowered Romanians' living standard,
already among the worst in Europe.
   The government has said it will not resign and that a strike
could bring grave consequences.
   Romanians are increasingly dissatisfied with the government of
the National Salvation Front one year after they ousted the
Communist dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu in a bloody revolution.
   The Front, which took over after Ceausescu's ouster last
December, overwhelmingly won May elections with pledges for gradual
economic reform.
   But price liberalization introduced Nov. 1 doubled or tripled
the prices of many consumer goods and some food products.
   Anti-government protest fueled by disillusionment as the
anniversary of the revolution approaches forced the government to
rescind plans last week for more food price increases Jan. 1.
   But the unions refused to withdraw the strike threat.
   Students at Bucharest's Polytechnic University and in the
western city of Timisoara declared a strike today, state radio
reported. They were pressing past demands for the resignation of
Iliescu, often accused by the opposition of being a neo-Communist.
   The nationwide Fratia labor federation, which claims about
800,000 members in various industries, is demanding that recent
price increases be rescinded, salaries raised and proposed
legislation restricting the right to strike withdrawn.
   It has threatened to call a nationwide general strike if the
demands are not met, or unless the government resigns by this
evening.
   The talks between the unions and the government began at
mid-morning at Iliescu's offices in the capital's Cotroceni Palace.
State radio said the government was represented by Roman, Reform
Minister Adrian Severin, and Social Services Minister Ion Aurel
Stoica.
   The union delegation was headed by Fratia leader Miron Mitrea,
who said Monday he expected a general strike to win support from
other large independent unions. A drivers union claiming 100,000
members struck Monday.
   Government spokesman Bogdan Baltazar said this the government
would not resign. ``The government was elected in free democratic
elections ... and is supported by the people,'' Baltazar told a
news conference.

   In these days of megabytes and disk
drives, writing a letter to Santa Claus just won't do.
   So Santa has upgraded to a computer and now receives and answers
wish lists by electronic mail with some assistance from a few
computer-literate elves.
   Santa went from a jolly old elf to a computer wizard with the
help of Joyce Perkins, creator of the On-Line Santa Project.
   Ms. Perkins teaches business computer applications at the El
Paso Technical Center, part of the public school system.
   A few weeks back, she set up Santa's mailbag on a computer
bulletin board. A bulletin board is a service computer users dial
up to share information and programs and contact each other.
   Ms. Perkins also enlisted her students as Santa's elves to reply
to all the letters that come in by modem, a device that lets
computers communicate via phone lines.
   Santa's electronic mailbox is overloading with wish lists from
children engaging in Yuletide log-ons.
   ``We've had a ball,'' said Ms. Perkins. ``It's taken off and
gone crazy.''
   Every day, the elves divide the messages, making sure Santa's
mail is answered quickly. They sign their messages with names such
as Frost-byte, Skippy Chips, Clickey Mouse and Nanosecond Nic.
   ``It's fun being able to chat with little kids,'' said Angel
Locklear, a senior at Austin High. ``They're learning, and we're
helping build up their dreams.''
   Among the requests for new bikes, talking dolls and electric
trains, came one appeal for 16,000 Nintendo cassettes.
   ``Aren't we being a little greedy,'' one of the elves messaged
back.

<TEXT>
   Polish authorities said today that
Stanislaw Tyminski, the defeated presidential contender, will
probably be allowed to go home to Canada if he guarantees he will
return to face a slander investigation.
   Meanwhile, the man who defeated him, President-elect Lech
Walesa, went to Poland's holiest Catholic shrine in Czestochowa
today to pay homage to the Black Madonna icon at the Jasna Gora
monastery.
   Later, Walesa was returning to Warsaw to mull over his choice
for prime minister. Walesa won a landslide victory over Tyminski in
Sunday's presidential runoff election and is to be sworn in for a
five-year term later this month.
   Tyminski, an emigre businessman, says he needs to go home to
Canada to gather evidence to defend himself against the slander
charges.
   The Justice Ministry said Tyminski was to be questioned today
and might be allowed to leave Wednesday if he makes a sufficient
guarantee he will return for legal proceedings.
   Tyminski and his Peruvian-born wife planed to leave for Toronto
on Wednesday morning. He said he only wanted to leave the country
for three days, and that he was prepared to put up $100,000 to
guarantee his return.
   A prosecutor in Nowy Sacz in southern Poland began a slander
investigation after Tyminski accused Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki of treason during a Nov. 17 campaign rally.
   The prosecutor's office in Warsaw said on Monday that Tyminski
had to stay in the country and answer a Dec. 17 summons in Nowy
Sacz.
   Tyminski said Mazowiecki, who lost in the first round of the
presidential election on Nov. 25, had betrayed the nation by
creating chaos through economic reform after taking office in
August 1989.
   There has been speculation that Tyminski, hounded by Poland's
highly partisan press, could return for good to Canada, where he
lived many of the past 21 years after leaving Poland to seek his
fortune.
   He has said he wants to remain active in Polish politics.
   ``My duty and responsibility is to stay here because I received
very strong suport,'' Tyminski said at a news conference today.
But he said he was unsure whether he would found an opposition
political party.
   Tyminski, a 42-year-old computer company owner who also brought
cable TV to the Peruvian jungle, portrayed his saga as a
rags-to-riches story and tapped into the Polish mythology of the
rich uncle in America.
   But his first-round election success was derailed before
Sunday's runoff by questions about his connections with former
Communist operatives and the vagueness of his promises for quick
economic recovery.
   Tyminski, who also has Canadian and Peruvian citizenship, had
lied with his children near Toronto until this fall, when he
returned to Poland.
   In making his request to leave Poland, Tyminski said he wanted
to see his children for the first time in more than two months.
   He also said he needed to prepare his defense using videotapes
of the Nov. 17 campaign rally that were taken to Canada. He said
the tapes will prove he did not slander Mazowiecki.

   Pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem guerrillas

   An Israeli army spokeswoman said no Israeli helicopters were in

   Police said there was no immediate word on casualties from the
reported 15-minute raid on Deidaba Hills, a stronghold of
Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   Hezbollah said in a communique issued in Rashaya that several of
its military bases in Deidaba, three miles north of Israel's
self-designated security zone, were attacked by Israeli Cobra
gunships.
   The communique did not give any other details.
   The air raid would be Israel's 19th in Lebanon this year. By
police count, 20 people were killed and 130 wounded in the previous

<TEXT>
   The man serving a life term in a state
prison for assassinating civil rights activist Malcolm X in 1965
has been denied parole.
   The decision by the state Board of Parole means 49-year-old
Thomas Hagan, also known as Talmadge X. Hayer, must serve another
two years before becoming eligible for another hearing, said Edward
Elwin, executive director of the Parole Board.
   Hagan, who is imprisoned at Edgecomb Correctional Facility in
Manhattan, has been a model prisoner and is one of only 30 inmates
who have qualified for an extended furlough program, said Kelly
Priess, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Corrections.
   However, the three-member parole panel, after a hearing in
November, cited ``the seriousness of the crime'' in rejecting
Hagan's request for early release, Elwin said Monday.
   Priess said Hagan has participated in the prison furlough
program since May 1989 and he is allowed to return home and work in
the community about four days a week.
   There was no indication in his prison records that Hagan has had
any disciplinary problems and he has shown ``acceptable behavior,''
Priess said.
   Malcolm X became a leading figure in the civil rights movement
in the 1960s. He also stirred controversy for his refusal to reject
violence in gaining freedom for ``people of African descent here in
the Western Hemisphere.''
   He was gunned down in February 1965 while speaking to supporters
at a rally in New York City. Hagan, who was shot in the leg by one
of Malcolm's bodyguards, has said the assassination was to avenge
blasphemies that he contended Malcolm X had made against Muslim
leader Elijah Muhammad.
   Hagan has said he did not know who ordered the killing.
   Two other men convicted of helping in the assassination,
Muhammed Abdul Aziz and Kahlil Islam, have been released on parole
in recent years.

grenades, security and listening devices,'' the motion said.
   Police found an article from The Jewish Press about Kahane's
most recent trip to the United States and an advertisement for the
lecture where the American-born founder of the militant Jewish
Defense League was killed, the motion said.
   The prosecution argued in the motion that the ammunition and
literature showed Nosair ``deliberately planned the murder.''
   Nosair, 35, was shot in the neck Nov. 5 by a U.S. Postal Service
policeman who happened to be outside the hotel where Kahane had
been speaking when he was killed.
   Nosair was scheduled to be examined by a private doctor today
after his lawyer said he was not well enough to be moved from a
hospital to a jail.
   Nosair, a native of Egypt, has been charged with murder in the
death of Kahane, who advocated the expulsion of Arabs from Israel.
He also is charged with two counts of attempted murder in the
wounding of a passerby and of the postal officer.
   Nosair, who is being held in lieu of $300,000 bail, was
scheduled for a bail hearing Monday, but Justice Alvin Schlesinger
postponed it until Dec. 18 because his attorney, Michael Warren,
was 35 minutes late.

   At least 35 people were killed today
as rival black factions battled with guns, knives and axes, setting
fire to shacks and chasing terrified people through the streets.
   Dozens of homes were burned and hundreds of residents fled as
rival groups battled for several hours during the morning in Tokoza
black township and in a surrounding industrial area. Hacked and
mutilated bodies lay outside houses that had been burned and
pillaged.
   The fighting pitted mostly Xhosas loyal to the African National
Congress against Zulus of the Inkatha Freedom Party in what
increasingly appeared to be a tribal confrontation. The Xhosas live
in a squatter camp, while the Zulus live in adjoining hostels.
   At least 53 people have died in factional fighting in Tokoza
since the latest fighting began on the weekend.
   ``Inkatha came. They were burning the shacks. They are trying to
drive us out,'' said a terrified Xhosa man wearing only trousers
and holding a club.
   Xhosa squatters armed with clubs, spears and knives gathered for
safety at one end of the township, while hundreds of armed Zulus in
white headbands were waiting in a migrant workers's hostel at the
other end of Tokoza.
   ``We want revenge ... We want to fight,'' some Zulus chanted.
   Police in armored vehicles roared through the dusty township on
the eastern outskirts of Johannesburg. Police patrols hovered on
the edges of the township, but rarely ventured into the narrow
lanes leading to its densely packed shacks.
   Xhosa and Zulu residents accused each other of starting the
violence. Both sides accused the police of collaborating with their
opponents.
   A number of Zulu women armed with clubs and knives, their faces
painted white, were helping guard the Zulu hostels. They claimed
the police had fired on them.
   ``The police don't help us,'' said one angry woman. ``The Xhosas
started the fighting. They better leave this place. This is for
Zulus only.''
   Enraged Xhosas at the other end of town yelled insults at the
police, saying they were ``Inkatha.''
   Police spokesman Capt. Eugene Opperman denied police were
involved in the fighting. ``We side with no one,'' he said.
   Opperman said the fighting apparently started today when Xhosas
attacked a Zulu hostel and the Zulus mounted a revenge attack.
   Police were fired on by men in a vehicle and fired back, killing
one man and wounding two others, Opperman said. No police were
hurt.
   More than 1,000 people have been killed in the factional riots
in the Johannesburg area since August. The ANC and Inkatha both
oppose apartheid, but both want to lead a non-apartheid South
Africa.
   Inkatha favors a conservative policy, including free enterprise,
while the ANC leans more to leftist economic policies.
   President F.W. de Klerk, who has promised to end apartheid, is
expected to begin talks next year on ending white-minority rule.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today sent
condolences to the family of Armand Hammer, citing the late
industrialist for his prominent role in Soviet-American relations.
   ``Mr. Hammer was associated with one of the most remarkable
pages of our relationship'' with the United States, the message
said. ``He met with Lenin and was very close in many ways to the
Soviet Union, and to Russia.''
   Gorbachev's message was read by his spokesman, Vitaly Ignatenko.
   Hammer died in Los Angeles on Monday after a brief illness. He
was 92.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh said Hammer will be
remembered in the Soviet Union for his tireless efforts to maintain
good relations with the Kremlin, even during the Cold War.
   ``Armand Hammer was not only an observer, a witness to the
decades in the history of Soviet-American relations, but also a man
who actively participated in the building of those relations,''
Gremitskikh said.
   ``His constructive activity was especially appreciable and
fruitful in the periods of coolness in the relations between the
U.S.S.R. and the United States,'' Gremitskikh said. ``He always
raised his voice, and in addressing leaders of both superpowers,
spoke out in favor of overcoming difficulties and for fruitful
cooperation in all spheres.''
   Hammer's involvement in the Soviet Union began in 1921 as a
young doctor just out of medical school who came to the country to
help in famine relief.
   He met with Vladimir Lenin and sought his help in
re-establishing trade between the Communist regime and the West. He
worked out a deal to trade surplus U.S. grain for Soviet products.
   At one point, Hammer was sole representative for 38 U.S.
companies in the Soviet Union, and also owned and operated an
asbestos mine and founded the first pencil factory in the nation.
   During one visit to the Soviet Union, he said: ``I'll never
forget what Lenin told me during one of our meetings. He said, `Dr.
Hammer, we don't need doctors. We need business people who can do
things.' That was the end of my promising medical career.''
   Hammer maintained his ties to the Soviet Union from the Lenin
years to the era of perestroika initiated by Gorbachev. He met with
every Soviet leader since Lenin.
   ``He always raised his voice, and in addressing leaders of both
superpowers, spoke out in favor of overcoming difficulties and for
fruitful cooperation in all spheres,'' Gremitskikh said.
   One of his largest developments in Moscow is the huge
Mezhdunarodnaya Hotel and SovIncenter exhibition complex. Built on
the banks of the Moscow River, it is known in the city as the
Hammer center.

   An 1879 law against homosexual sodomy is
unconstitutional, a state judge has ruled.
   ``It's great, really exciting. This is a very important day for
us,'' said Nell Hahn, attorney for the Texas Human Rights
Foundation, which helped file the suit challenging the law.
   District Judge Paul Davis announced the ruling after a hearing
Monday, and said a written opinion explaining the decision would be
issued Jan. 2.
   A spokesman for the state attorney general's office said no
decision has been made on an appeal.
   Gay men and women from Austin, Houston and Dallas challenged the
law that makes it a Class C misdemeanor, punishable by a $200 fine,
for consenting adults of the same sex to have ``deviant sexual
intercourse.''
   The plaintiffs asserted that the law violates Texas
constitutional guarantees of privacy, equal protection and due
process, as well as the state Equal Rights Amendment.

   The parliament of the Russian Federation and the
president of the Kazakh republic today rejected Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev's proposal to retain central control over the
economy.
   Gorbachev has proposed a new Union Treaty to keep the 15 Soviet
republics together and to maintain central government control over
key natural resources and major industries.
   But the Russian republic's Congress of People's Deputies and
Nursultan Nazarbayev, president of Kazakhstan, the third-largest
Soviet republic, each said they would sign the proposed treaty only
if it gives them control over their own economies.
   ``We stand for the treaty,'' Nazarbayev said. ``But attempts
from the top to organize the treaty will not succeed.''
   Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation - the largest
Soviet republic - has taken the same stand, and repeated it on
Monday as the Russian parliament voted to appoint a commission to
negotiate the Union Treaty, the state news agency Tass reported.
   The legislatures of the second-largest Soviet republic, the
Ukraine, and all but one of the remaining republics have declared
economic and political sovereignty. The 15th, Kirgizia, was
reportedly debating the issue this week.
   Nazarbayev said at a news conference he thought at least 11
Soviet republics would sign the treaty. The three Baltic republics
and Moldavia, he said, were boycotting the negotiations.
   ``The economic integration of the republics will not allow us to
get out of this crisis separately. We must do it together,''
Nazarbayev said.
   He said the balance of ownership must change.
   Now, central authorities own 93 percent of businesses in
Kazakhstan and turn over less than 1 percent of the profits.
   Nazarbayev said that under his republic's sovereignty
declaration passed Oct. 25, his Central Asian republic would take
control of those businesses, including substantial coal reserves in
the eastern part of the republic and a huge oil and natural gas
field now being explored in Western Kazakhstan.
   Moreover, Kazakhstan plans to sign a contract with a U.S.
consortium in January to exploit an oil field, and Kazakhstan plans
to reap its share of the profits from that deal rather than send
them to the central government, he said.
   The vote by the Russian Federation Congress of People's Deputies
marked a small victory for Gorbachev, because it commits Russia to
be ``a full-fledged subject of the renewed U.S.S.R. on the basis of
a new Union Treaty.''
   But it also gives Yeltsin strong leverage in negotiations with
Gorbachev by asserting the right of each republic for
self-determination and gives the central government responsibility
only for defense, state security and foreign policy.
   The draft proposed by Gorbachev would retain broader powers for
the central government, including control over transportation and
energy supplies.
   The Russian parliament decided to appoint a commission of
lawmakers to work with representatives of the central government
and other republics to work on the draft Union Treaty. No date has
been set for its completion.

<DATELINE>CHELTENHAM, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Conservative Party member
apologized today to a black parliamentary candidate for racist
remarks that had been condemned by local and national party
leaders.
   William Galbraith issued his apology on the day the Cheltenham
Conservative Party Association was scheduled to vote on expelling
him. Galbraith's remarks had been condemned by Prime Minister John
Major and other Tory leaders.
   Cheltenham police were investigating complaints that Galbraith's
remarks about John Taylor, who hopes to be the first black
Conservative in the House of Commons, were an incitement to racial
hatred.
   After Taylor had been selected as the local candidate for the
next national election, Galbraith was quoted in a national
newspaper as calling Taylor ``a bloody nigger.'' Galbraith repeated
the slur in broadcast interviews.
   Galbraith also said he was unhappy that Taylor was not a
resident of Cheltenham, an almost totally white, heavily
middle-class town, although it is common in British politics for
parliamentary candidates to be outsiders.
   Major declared in the House of Commons that the remarks had no
place within the Conservative Party, and Galbraith has been banned
from the local Conservative Club and from two of his favorite pubs.
   On Tuesday, Galbraith issued a statement supporting Taylor.
   ``Mr. Galbraith acknowledges that Mr. Taylor's color and ethnic
origins are utterly irrelevant in the circumstances,'' Galbraith
said in the statement released by his lawyers.
   Taylor said he was pleased with the apology.
   ``I have never made race and color an electoral issue,'' he
said. ``I have always remained at arms length from all this - all I
wanted to do was to get on with the pleasant task of getting to
know the people of Cheltenham. All this has been a diversion.''
   Taylor, 38, was selected two weeks ago as the Conservative
candidate for Cheltenham, a picturesque town 120 miles northwest of
London.
   He has run previously as a Conservative candidate in Solihull,
his home town in central England. Typically, aspiring politicians
have to run one or more hopeless campaigns before being selected in
a district where they have a chance of winning.
   Taylor, the son of a West Indian cricket player, is a barrister
- a lawyer qualified to argue cases in court - and a member of the
local council Solihull.
   There are only four blacks in the 650-seat House of Commons, all
members of the Labor Party.
   About 5 percent of Britain's population is classified as
``non-white,'' a broad label that includes West Indians,
Pakistanis, Indians Chinese and persons of mixed race.

   The Irish Republican Army today
apologized for killing a Protestant bakery worker it thought was a
member of the security forces.
   David Shiels, 30, was shot to death on Dec. 3 as he stepped
outside his mobile home in Maghera, 30 miles northwest of Belfast,
to feed his dog. His brother works as a police officer.
   The IRA issued a statement today which said the gunmen were
``acting on erroneous information'' and it ``profoundly
apologized.''
   The dead man's brother, George Shiels, rejected the apology.
   ``I treat that with utter contempt. Do they consider themselves
officers and gentlemen that they dare offer such apologies to us?''
Shiels said.
   In other developments today, British news reports said the IRA
was conducting a campaign to intimidate Protestant and Catholic
shop owners who serve police officers and soldiers.
   Garage, cafe, and fast-food shop owners have placed
advertisements in Northern Ireland newspapers indicating their
intention to stop serving the forces after their lives were
threatened, press reports said.
   The IRA is fighting British rule in Northern Ireland. It wants
to unite the predominantly Protestant province with the 95 percent
Catholic Republic of Ireland, under socialist rule.

<TEXT>
   An October 1991 trial date has been set for a $200
million civil lawsuit against Neil Bush and other key figures in
the collapse of Silverado Banking Savings and Loan.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. filed the lawsuit against
the president's son and 12 other former Silverado directors,
attorneys and executives in September. The suit claims the
officials were ``grossly negligent'' in their management of
Silverado, which collapsed in 1988.
   The bailout of the thrift is expected to cost taxpayers about $1
billion.
   The suit claims the defendants authorized excessive compensation
to management and approved a series of loans and other transactions
that drove the $2.3 billion thrift into insolvency.
   U.S. District Judge Sherman Finesilver scheduled the trial to
begin Oct. 7, 1991, according to court documents made public
Monday.
   Defense attorneys said there is still a chance that the case
will be settled out of court or dismissed.
   Bush, who served as a outside director at Silverado from 1985 to
1988, has filed a motion to dismiss the case against him on the
grounds that federal banking regulators approved all the
transactions he voted on as director. Most of his co-defendants
also are seeking to have charges against them dropped.
   Bush also is fighting a separate action brought by the federal
Office of Thrift Supervision accusing him of operating as a
Silverado director with conflicts of interest.

   Rescue workers searched the Gulf of Mexico
today for the pilots of two Navy jets that collided during takeoff
and landing practice from the carrier USS Lexington.
   The two TA-4 Skyhawks collided Monday during routine training
maneuvers 86 miles northwest of Key West, Navy officials said. Both
pilots were missing.
   ``One aircraft was verified to have gone into the water,
threfore destroyed,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Ray Kempisty, a Navy
spokesman for the Chief of Naval Education and Training in
Pensacola. ``The other is missing and presumed destroyed.''
   The Lexington, the Navy's oldest aircraft carrier, is homeported
in Pensacola.
   The Navy said the pilots were Philip J. Palmatier Jr.,
commanding officer of a training squadron, and Ensign Troy A.
Moore, a flight student. Both pilots were stationed at Naval Air
Station Chase Field in Beeville, Texas.
   A duty officer at Pensacola said the pilots' flight suits have
glow strips and carry strobe lights, flares and a radio beacon.
   The weather in the area at the time of the crash was mostly
clear, with light winds. Ships and aircraft took part in the
search.
   The TA-4s are built by McDonnell Douglas Corp., and are capable
of carrying 10,000 pounds of munitions and traveling at a top speed
of 675 mph, according to Jane's ``All the World's Aircraft.''
   The Lexington is scheduled to be decommissioned next November
after 47 years of service. In 1989, A T-2 Buckeye trainer crashed
into the ship's control island and cartwheeled across the flight
deck in a fireball, killing five people.
   The student pilot at the controls was attempting his first
landing on a carrier. Navy investigators were unable to pinpoint a
cause for that crash.

   A suspected Soviet agent was detained in
Salzburg today after receiving documents about U.S. weapons systems
from an informant who escaped into a crowd of Christmas shoppers,
officials said.
   The arrested man hada Soviet diplomatic passport and claimed to
be accredited at the embassy in Vienna, senior intelligence
official Karl Koenig said in a telephone interview from Salzburg.
   Police detained the unidentified 39-year-old man on a Salzburg
street after he was given a thick envelope by another man, Koenig
said. The contact man escaped in the late morning Christmas bustle
and traffic, he said.
   Koenig said police acted on confidential information.
   The detained man is allegedly an officer of the Soviet military
intelligence GRU, but police refused to identify him while they try
to determine his name and the validity of his diplomatic passport.
   Koenig said police were unable to reach anyone at Vienna's
Soviet Embassy.
   A spokesman at the embassy who did not identify himself told The
Associated Press he knew nothing of the incident and could
therefore not comment.
   Koenig said the material in the envelope included materials
about U.S. weapons categories, technical know-how, and the U.S.
space agency NASA. He said the material was all in English and was
being sent to the prosecutor's office.
   If the man is a diplomat accredited in Austria, he would have to
be released because of diplomatic immunity.

<HEAD>Jury Convicts Six Sheriff's Deputies of Stealing Drug Dealer Cash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six members of an elite narcotics squad were
convicted of stealing thousands of dollars in drug money in a
scandal that rocked the Los Angeles County sheriff's department.
   A seventh deputy was convicted of money laundering Monday in the
case, which led to the disbanding of whole sheriff's units and
imperiled dozens of criminal cases.
   Federal prosecutors portrayed the deputies as corrupt lawmen who
skimmed money taken in drug raids to buy boats, homes, cars and
vacations.
   The jury convicted the deputies on 24 criminal charges.
   ``We trust these people and now they're doing things they
shouldn't be doing, things that they arrest people for doing,''
juror Dawn Hurtt said.
   The defendants were members of an anti-drug unit that was
responsible for some of the department's largest cocaine and drug
money seizures. The deputies had up to 23 years of experience with
the sheriff's department.
   ``The verdicts handed down today are not an occasion to
celebrate, they are not a victory,'' Sheriff Sherman Block said in
a statement. ``They are the just conclusion to the unlawful actions
of a few who sought to hide their crimes behind a badge of honor.''
   The U.S. District Court jury also convicted six of the deputies
for conspiracy and theft. Five were found guilty of lying on their
tax returns.
   The jury deadlocked on 26 other counts, which Judge Edward
Rafeedie dismissed. Three deputies were acquitted of charges
related to the theft of $527,000.
   The deputies remained free on bail.
   ``I'm sure this jury did the best job they could,'' said
defendant James R. Bauder. ``But we're disappointed.''
   The scandal broke in February when federal prosecutors filed a
27-count indictment accusing the deputies of stealing $1.4 million
in drug cash.
   However, the jury only found the deputies guilty of taking
$48,000 in a 1989 incident videotaped during an FBI sting
operation.
   The scandal led to an investigation of the nation's largest
sheriff's department. Block disbanded four narcotics teams and set
a five-year limit on the time a deputy can spend working in the
narcotics bureau.
   Dozens of narcotics officers were transferred and more than 30
criminal cases were dismissed, became subject to plea bargains, or
came under review.
   A federal grand jury continues to investigate the department and
some narcotics officers in the Los Angeles Police Department.
   Prosecutors accused the deputies of seizing cash during raids
and obtaining statements from alleged traffickers disowning the
cash. The deputies then allegedly stole some of the money and
distributed it among themselves.
   Prosecutors pointed to evidence of thousands of dollars stashed
in shoe boxes at deputies' homes and alleged shopping sprees that
showed the men were living well beyond their $40,000 to $60,000
salaries.
   The deputies said they got the extra cash through baby-sitting,
gambling or inheritance.
   Two other narcotics deputies are scheduled to stand trial next
year in the case.

   About 100 pickets marched outside Chicago's
landmark Tribune Tower this morning in support of striking New York
Daily News unions as the Tribune Co.'s directors prepared to
discuss the tabloid's future.
   ``Settle or sell,'' chanted the pickets, who were led by three
representatives from the Daily News branch of The Newspaper Guild,
the newsroom workers' union.
   The publishing company's board of directors was to discuss the
strike, now in its 47th day, during its regular meeting today.
Among its options are selling the New York tabloid, closing it down
or waiting out the strike.
   ``The Tribune organization has been trying to set up a situation
where they could legally destroy the unions - force a strike, so
they could legally shut down the paper,'' Don Singleton, a Daily
News reporter and bargaining team member, told the crowd.
   ``We hope we can convince the Tribune not to shut the place
down. Stop wasting the millions of dollars they have been spending
to bust the unions.''
   Don Turner of the Chicago Federation of Labor said the company
``tries to kill unions. But we know in the end the workers are
going to be victorious, as they always are.''
   Three Chicago Tribune unions that walked out in 1985 had also
accused the company of bargaining in bad faith.
   The pickets were from various Chicago labor groups. The
demonstration was peaceful.
   On Monday, the News and its unions said they will go to
Washington this week and meet separately with the director of a
federal mediation service.
   The Allied Printing Trades Council, the umbrella of the striking
unions, is to meet with Bernard DeLury, director of the Federal
Mediation and Conciliation Service, on Wednesday morning. DeLury
will meet separately with management.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Cardinal John
O'Connor addressed an estimated 6,500 people at a pro-union rally
Monday in front of the News offices.
   Cuomo, in his first show of support for the strikers, said a
federal law allowing the use of replacement workers is ``not wise''
and ``not fair.''
   ``We need to resolve this matter at the Daily News to show the
world it can be done,'' Cuomo said.
   Jackson told the crowd that ``strike breakers are also family
breakers'' and that the use of replacement workers is ``immoral, it
is illeal, it is wrong.''
   In a letter to O'Connor released Monday, News publisher James
Hoge said: ``I have been troubled by press reports of your
questioning the morality of the Daily News exercising its lawful
rights to employ replacement workers. We would not have done so
unless the very survival of the business was not threatened after
the strike began.''
   The News has printed daily since the strike began Oct. 25. But
its distribution has been curtailed by violence against delivery
drivers, threats against newsstand vendors and a union-led boycott,
which also crippled advertising sales.
   The strike has cut the News' circulation from 1.09 million to
552,000 as of last week.
   The News says that by the end of this year its losses over the
past decade will have mounted to about $200 million and that it
must have major concessions to operate profitably.

   A hot air balloon struck a broadcast tower
near the city's downtown today and crashed, killing four people.
   The balloon crashed in a wooded area behind the studios of
television station WBNS.
   Three men, all licensed hot air balloon pilots, and a woman
riding in the gondola were killed, police said.
   Radio station WTVN-AM reported that the balloon took off from
Mohawk Middle School, but no students from the school were on
board.
   The balloon drifted northwest and passed over the downtown
before it crashed about two miles west of downtown.
   Lt. Randy Thatcher of the State Highway Patrol said the balloon
went into a steep climb to clear the broadcast tower.
   ``It snagged on the top of the antenna and fell,'' Thatcher
said. ``Half the descent was fairly slow until all the air was out
of the envelope. Then it fell straight down very fast.''
   John Remy, a reporter for WTVN, said he was on his way to work
when he saw the balloon hit the tower, which is 1,069 feet tall. He
said the balloon appeared to fall about 900 feet.
   ``I was sort of watching this balloon, and I said to myself it
looks awful close to the tower, but that's just my line of sight,''
he said. ``But then it hit it, popped and just burst into shreds.
   ``It went straight down. ... It was a terrible thing to see.''
   The balloon was owned by a restaurant, Bogey Inn. Karl Demmler,
owner of the restaurant, was en route to the site. Eric Ingwersen,
who runs a hot air balloon school and was acting president of the
Central Ohio Balloon Club, usually operated the balloon, and was
one of the pilots killed in the crash.
   Authorities were alerted to the crash at 8:22 a.m. The Federal
Aviation Administration sent an investigator to the site.
   The green-and-yellow fabric of the balloon was draped over the
edge of a small stand of trees adjacent to the tower, about 50 feet
from a stanchion that holds five of the cable guy wires that steady
the tower. What appeared to be a piece of the balloon fabric
fluttered from the broadcast tower.

   Industrialist Armand Hammer often said he was

``Camille.''
   But he conceded later that his father, a socialist, also had in
mind the arm-and-hammer symbol of the Socialist Labor Party.
   For years, people erroneously thought Hammer was connected to
the company that makes Arm &amp; Hammer baking soda.
   Irked by the continuing questions, Hammer finally worked out a

stake in the baking soda company and him a seat on its board.

   At least seven people were reported killed
and 50 injured in a 50-vehicle pileup this morning on a fogbound
Interstate 75.
   Wrecked cars, some of them burning, littered a five-mile stretch
of the Knoxville-to-Chattanooga interstate hours after the 9:30
a.m. accident.
   Some troopers responding to the massive pileup were overcome by
fumes, but hazardous materials teams at the scene said any danger
from a burning truck carrying dicumyl peroxide had dissipated.
   Joe Wilson of the Bradley County Emergency Management Agency
said seven people were confirmed dead and at least 50 injured.
   Wrecks occurred in both the southbound and northbound lanes of
the interstate and hampered efforts to remove the injured. Some
suffered burns and several were in critical condition at hospitals
in nearby Athens and Cleveland.
   ``We have staffed our emergency room and have put our disaster
plan into play,'' said Linda Dunlap, assistant nursing
administrator at Cleveland's Bradley Memorial Hospital.
   Sue Allison of the Tennessee Department of Safety in Nashville
said a propane tanker was involved but not damaged in the accident,
the worst of which was concentrated on a bridge over the Hiwassee
River near the Bowater paper mill.
   One southbound lane was reopened 1{ hours after the accident.
   Four fire trucks, several ambulances and helicopters from
Knoxville and Chattanooga hospitals were called to the scene, said
Steve Weber, a Cleveland Police Department dispatcher.
   Cecil Whaley, director of the Tennessee Emergency Management
Agency, blamed the accident on the thick fog.
   ``Boy, it's a mess. It's a California-type accident where a
thick fog bank formed and people started running into it,'' he
said.

   President-elect Lech Walesa will be a
patron of a new museum planned to commemorate Jews murdered in Nazi
concentration camps on Polish soil, according to reports Tuesday.
   The Polish news agency PAP also reported that Walesa was invited
to visit Israel by President Chaim Herzog.
   The museum would be on the site of the former Warsaw Ghetto,
where Jews were first isolated and then deported to death camps
during the German occupation, the news agency said.
   The initiative is being undertaken by Walesa's advisory Citizens
Committee, it said. A foundation will be established to raise money
and establish the museum in a former hospital next to
Umschlagplatz, where the Nazis loaded Jews onto trains for
transport to death camps.
   Among the concentration camps established in occupied Poland
were Treblinka, Auschwitz, Birkenau and Maidanek. The Warsaw ghetto
was razed by the Nazis after a last desperate uprising in 1943.
   During the presidential campaign that ended with Walesa's
landslide victory Sunday, the Solidarity chief was accused by
political opponents of tolerating anti-Semitism among some
supporters. Walesa denied the charge and condemned the resurgence
of anti-Semitism in post-Communist Poland.

<HEAD>WHO Endorses Unchanged Use Of Contraceptive Pills</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decade-long study of possible links between oral
contraceptive use and cancer found the evidence too inconclusive to
warrant changes in prescribing the pill, the World Health
Organization said Tuesday.
   An expert panel said that family planning programs based on the
pill do not need to be changed.
   The agency reported on studies in eight developing and three
industrialized countries that explored whether using the pill
increases the risk of cancer.
   Experts from 11 countries met privately at WHO headquarters in
Geneva to review the studies and other evidence, according to a
statement issued by the agency.
   Their findings included:
   -Most studies suggest no general link between the pill and
cervical or breast cancer. More research is needed because some
studies have found connections between long-term oral contraceptive
use and the risk of either cancer among some groups of women. But
the link could also be due to better disease detection or special
characteristics of women using the pill.
   -Oral contraceptives increase the risk of benign liver tumors,
but this is a very rare complication.
   -The pill can reduce the risk of ovarian cancer, cancer of the
inner-lining of the uterus and benign breast diseases.
   The general conclusion was that ``evidence about the association
between oral contraceptives and various types of tumors does not
indicate there is any need for a change in policy in prescribing
the contraceptive pill,'' said Dr. Olof Meirik, an official in
WHO's human reproduction program.
   More than 60 million women are believed to use the pill
worldwide, nearly two-thirds of them in developing countries, WHO
said.

<HEAD>Panda Twins Doing Well, Zoo Officials Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Chinese zoo's first artificially conceived
panda twins passed their three-month birthday in good health,
making panda history, an official report said Tuesday.
   The Xinhua News Agency quoted Zhang Anju, vice president of the
China Zoo Society, as saying that the twins, one male and one
female, are ``sure to survive'' at this point.
   Most giant pandas born in captivity die in their first weks,
and scientists are not sure why.
   Zhang said the problem was especially acute with pandas
conceived through artificial insemination, as the twins were. It
also is rare for both twin pandas to survive because mother pandas
frequently take care of one and neglect the other.
   Zhang said the female cub's weight had increased from 5.3 ounces
when it was born Aug. 24 to more than 13 pounds as of Monday. The
male's weight increased from 5 ounces to 13 pounds.
   They were born at the Chengdu Zoo in southwestern China, which
has an active program of inseminating captive pandas. The procedure
is controversial among scientists. Many foreign wildlife experts
argue that it would be better to reproduce conditions in the wild
to encourage mating and natural pregnancies.
   Xinhua said only 24 of the 1,155 pandas born worldwide as a
result of artificial insemination have survived. The twin's mother,
Qingqing, was herself the product of artificial insemination.
   China has the world's only wild panda population, but its
numbers have plummeted in recent decades to between 1,100 and 1,500
due to poaching and human encroachment on its habitat. About 100
pandas live in Chinese zoos.

<HEAD>Oliva to Succeed Brademas as NYU President</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For release at 6:30 p.m. EST, time set by source</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   L. Jay Oliva, a scholar in Russian history and
chancellor of New York University, was named Tuesday to succeed
John Brademas as president of NYU.
   Oliva, 57, will assume the presidency of the nation's largest
private university in January 1992.
   Brademas, a former 11-term Indiana congressman who served as
NYU's president since 1981, will become president emeritus in 1992.
He had said last summer he would step down as president when he
turned 65.
   Oliva's appointment by NYU's board of trustees came as no
surprise. A trustee committee decided to forgo a national search
when it became clear Oliva had overwhelming support from all
constituencies.
   Oliva will be the first faculty member to lead the
44,000-student university in its 159-year history, said Laurence A.
Tisch, chairman of NYU's board of trustees.
   ``In Dr. Oliva, we have not only a great teacher and outstanding
scholar, but someone who understands the way a university functions
on every level,'' Tisch said.
   Oliva has a reputation as an easygoing, approachable
administrator who lives in a student dormitory with his wife, Mary
Ellen.
   In an interview Tuesday, Oliva said he planned to remain in that
dorm room as president and to continue teaching.
   ``I've been waiting all my life to say, this is the age of the
teacher,'' he said.
   Asked if Russian history held any lessons for someone about to
assume a college presidency, Oliva singled out Czar Peter the
Great, the subject of one of Oliva's books.
   ``Peter the Great felt it was totally unproductive to be daunted
by big problems. Peter never brooked the idea that a big challenge
was impossible,'' he said.
   Brademas greatly increased NYU's stature, aided by his
formidable fund-raising abilities. Since 1981, NYU raised more than
$800 million, dorm space was greatly expanded, and the university
moved to the front ranks nationally in fields including business,
fine arts, and accounting.
   The cost has risen with the reputation. Tuition, fees, room and
board for entering students this fall were $21,400, among the
nation's highest.
   Oliva said one of his priorities will be to make it easier for
students to cross departmental lines in their studies - to
encourage law students to take courses in the business school or
the school of public administration, for example.
   ``We've got our buildings. Now what I want to see is a community
of scholars,'' he said.

   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said
today he and President Bush have smoothed relations between their
two countries strained by the U.S. partnership with Arab leaders
against Iraq.
   The president issued a ``warm welcome'' to Shamir at the outset
of their Oval Office talks this morning, but he rebuffed questions
from reporters about the Middle East situation.
   ``We have been delighted to express our full support for the
leadership of the president, for the policy of the United States in
this recent crisis of the gulf,'' Shamir told reporters after
spending nearly two hours with Bush at the White House.
   ``And the president also expresses his support for our behavior,
for our policy'' in the crisis, Shamir added.
   Israeli officials said before the meeting that Shamir would tell
Bush that Israel does not intend to launch any pre-emptive strikes
against Iraq.
   Assistant Secretary of State John Kelly said that Shamir didn't
talk about ``potential Israeli actions'' but that Bush thanked him
for keeping a low profile in the crisis.
   ``There was a strong expression of identity of views on seeing
Iraqi aggression rebuffed,'' Kelly told reporters.
   But he also said ``there was no attempt to duck the tough
issues'' of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories and
Israel's use of force against Palestinian protests in those areas.
Kelly did not elaborate.
   The administration has been concerned in recent days by
suggestions from senior Israeli officials that if the United States
doesn't dismantle Iraq's military machine, Israel might.
   ``We have reached general understanding, more or less, on all
the moves in the gulf and on Israel's position,'' Shamir told
reporters.   The meeting ``will enhance the special relationship between
the
United States and Israel,'' Shamir said.
   Israel has been torn between its promise to the United States to
lay low in the Persian Gulf crisis, and fears that the
administration is moving toward a diplomatic solution that will
leave intact Iraq's stores of chemical and biological weapons.
   Administration officials have been discussing arms control
measures that might be used to prevent Iraq from menacing its
neighbors once the current crisis is resolved.
   ``Israel looks to the United States to provide the leadership
and resolve that will rid the Middle East of such dangers in the
future,'' Shamir said in a statement issued in New York on Monday.
   But, he added, ``Saddam Hussein of Iraq knows that Israel will
not remain passive if he tries to harm us.''
   Saddam has threatened Israel with chemical weapons, and Israel's
air force has been on high alert since his Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait.
   Bush and Shamir also discussed the shape of the Middle East
after the crisis with Iraq is resolved. Shamir said they agreed
that substantive peace moves would have to await resolution of the
gulf crisis.
   Israelis are worried that some U.S. allies in the gulf crisis,
especially Syria and Saudi Arabia, will demand payment for their
support in the form of U.S. pressure on Israel to relinquish lands
it captured from the Arabs in the 1967 Mideast war.
   But Shamir said he had been assured by Bush this would not
happen. ``I trust the president,'' he said, that ``there won't be
any deal at the expense of Israel.''
   ``We trust the American government's determined stand not to
permit Saddam Hussein to link the gulf crisis with the Arab-Israel
conflict and the Palestinian issue,'' Shamir said in his New York
remarks.
   The administration, while rejecting attempts by Iraq and its
allies to link the two issues in a United Nations Security Council
resolution under debate in New York, is keen on reviving stalled
Mideast peace moves.
   Dennis Ross, a senior aide to Secretary of State James A. Baker
III, will head for Israel next week to discuss how to move toward
talks on Arab-Israeli peace.
   U.S. attempts until now have focused on getting Israelis to sit
down with Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip,
but the Palestinians' fervent support for Iraq in the gulf crisis
has changed that equation.
   The Israeli government, which has balked at the U.S. attempts,
hopes to seize the opportunity to press for a changed peace
formula.
   Israeli officials said Shamir was stressing that the shape of
future Mideast talks will depend on the outcome of the
confrontation with Iraq: if the U.S. side emerges victorious,
members of the coalition like Syria and Saudi Arabia might be
willing to talk peace with Israel.
   But a perception that Iraq has gained the upper hand would
scuttle all hopes for peace by strengthening the Arab hardliners,
Israeli officials say.
   Israel also is seeking additional U.S. help in absorbing the
flood of Jews - 1,000 to 2,000 a day - immigrating from the Soviet
Union.
   Shamir said Israel's population of 4.5 million could grow by 1
million in the next three to five years, and the cost could reach
$40 billion. Israeli officials said Shamir wasn't making a specific
aid request, but that Israel is looking for the type of guarantees
the administration provided this year to finance the construction
of $400 million in new homes.
   Shamir said Bush had promised that Israel's request would be
debated.

<HEAD>State Treasurer's Office Announces Expedited Payments</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state treasurer's office announced today
that it would expedite payments to Philadelphia to help it past a
fiscal crisis that threatens a payless payday for city workers Dec.
28.
   An aide to State Treasurer Catherine Baker Knoll said the
announcement was released prematurely by mistake, but that the
payments would be made.
   The treasurer had planned to review two more documents before an
announcement, executive deputy treasurer Seymore Heyison said from
Harrisburg. He would not elaborate on the nature of the mistake or
the additional documents.
   In a letter to Mayor W. Wilson Goode, Mrs. Knoll said, ``At this
difficult time for the city, you can be assured that I remain
deeply concerned about the city's financial difficulties.''
   A week ago, Mrs. Knoll said she would not invest in a proposed
sale of short-term notes to help the city remain solvent until
major tax payments come due in February and March.
   The treasurer's refusal to join the note sale was a blow to the
Goode administration, which also is asking the city pension fund,
state teachers pension fund, local banks and private investors to
buy about $300 million in notes this month.
   ``The mayor believes this is an important ingredient to the
short-term note sale,'' Goode's press secretary, Karen Warrington,
said. ``It provides ability to have the state pay directly to a
third party. And it increases the security for any short-term
monies that we would want to borrow.''
   Heyison said he did not know how much money the city would
receive, or how soon, as a result of the directive.
   ``It all depends on what request they send over from various
agencies,'' he said.
   Philadelphia's requests would be handled with the same review
measures as they would normally, he added.
   ``We're not doing anything differently than we normally do for
voucher transmittals other than expediting the processing,'' he
said.
   City workers and pensioners widely oppose risking part of their
$1.5 billion in pension funds to help Philadelphia meet its
short-term obligations, said Charles Johnson, a municipal printer
who serves on the city Board of Pensions and Retirement.
   The board meets Thursday and Friday, but a vote may be delayed.
No formal proposal had been made by the city as of Monday, and the
board has hired Washington attorney Ian Lanoff to advise them on
whatever proposal is made.
   The city's credit rating has dropped to junk-bond levels during
its fiscal crisis this year, making its notes too risky for the
pension board's normal investment guidelines.
   But Goode recently signed a law that allows the board to invest
until July 1 in any Philadelphia obligation, regardless of quality.
   Sluggish tax revenues and arbitration-awarded pay increases have
added to past budget imbalances to create a projected $229.5
million deficit for the fiscal year that started July 1.
   A $375 million note issue flopped in September, leading to a
cash crisis. Until major tax payments come due in February and
March, the city risks having to survive on daily receipts of less
than one-fourth its average $9 million daily bills.

   A judge granted a divorce this morning to Donald
and Ivana Trump, citing the millionaire developer's ``cruel and
inhuman treatment'' of his wife.
   Mrs. Trump, supported by her lawyer Michael Kennedy, fled the
Manhattan courthouse in tears after the divorce was approved.
   State Supreme Court Justice Phyllis Gangel-Jacob granted the
divorce in response to a petition by Mrs. Trump. The judge said her
decree was ``based on Mr. Trump's cruel and inhuman treatment such
as made it unfaith or improper to continue to be married.''
   Trump had a much publicized affair with would-be actress Marla
Maples in the past year.
   ``There is going to be no further comment other than she has her
divorce,'' said a woman in Kennedy's law office.
   Trump issued a two-sentence statement saying: ``I wish Ivana the
best. I have no doubt that she will do very well in the years to
come.''
   The judge said all other issues such as maintenance, child
support, equitable distribution and the validity of any pre- and
post-marital agreement will be decided at trial, unless they are
otherwise resolved.
   No date was set for such a trial.
   Trump has said his wife signed a marital agreement giving her
$25 million and their Connecticut mansion. Mrs. Trump has
challenged the agreement.
   The couple has three children.

   As the governors wound up their annual conference, Campbell and

state spending.
   ``The mandates that are coming out are breaking the states,''
Thompson said.
   Campbell said federal requirements for spending on Medicaid and
other programs are diverting funds that should go to education and
other state needs.
   ``Our message to the president is: `Please stop it - use your

   More than 50 pilot whales were found
beached today on Squaw Island near the Kennedy family compound on
Cape Cod and volunteers rushed to try to rescue them.
   ``They are still alive at this moment,'' said James Ellis,

rescuers would try to determine which whales are in the best shape
to be returned to the water. The tide had already gone out, leaving
some of the whales in shallow pools.
   It was the first mass beaching in the area since 70 pilot whales
beached themselves at several spots four years ago. Most of those
whales died, but three young whales beached on the Cape three years
ago were rescued and returned to the sea.
   Experts disagree on the cause of the beachings. Theories include
that the pod, or school, of whales follows a sick leader ashore, or
that the marine mammals are disoriented by magnetic variations
along geological faults.
   The rescue effort, being coordinated by the New England
Aquarium, included the Centers for Coastal Studies, the
International Wildlife Coalition and the International Fund for
Animal Welfare, said Kathy Shorr, a spokesman for the Center for
Coastal Studies.

   An aide to California Sen. Alan Cranston today
denied she pressured or asked federal regulators to reverse their
decision tightening controls on Charles H. Keating Jr.'s troubled
Lincoln Savings and Loan.
   Testifying at the Senate Ethics Committee's Keating Five
hearings, Carolyn Jordan said she talked by telephone with two
staff regulators in May 1988 but did not make a request to go easy
on Lincoln.
   Jordan, Cranston's staff assistant on the Senate Banking
Committee, underwent friendly questioning by Cranston's defense
attorney, William Taylor.
   ``Did you put any kind of pressure on (the regulators) in any
way to change their ways and ease pressure,'' Taylor asked.
   ``I did not say anything ... No I did not,'' Jordan said.
   Jordan spent all morning on the witness stand, and her sometimes
spotty memory provoked a sharp complaint by the ranking Republican
on the ethics panel, Sen. Warren Rudman of New Hampshire.
   ``I'd like to get more specific,'' Rudman said, interrupting the
questioning.
   ``The witness obviously has very good recollection about some
things and very poor recollection about others. I think we've got
to guard against just getting totally meaningless answers,'' he
said.
   Jordan was questioned about her contacts with thrift examiners
on behalf of Keating around the time of a key regulatory decision
in May 1988.
   The panel heard testimony last week that she called the Federal
Home Loan Bank Board to complain about a May 5, 1988, plan to
impose new regulatory controls on Lincoln.
   She acknowledged making the call and mentioning her contacts
with Keating's lobbyist, Jim Grogan.
   Two weeks later the board eased its regulatory grip on Lincoln.
The result of the board's change was that eventual takeover of
Lincoln was delayed and the cost of the taxpayers' bailout of
insured deposits was increased, according to federal regulator
William K. Black.
   Earlier, she testified she found nothing unusual about
Cranston's meeting with regulators on behalf of Keating.
   She said she did not know until months later about the April 2,
1987, meeting that four of the senators, including Cranston, held
with then top thrift regulator Edwin J. Gray, on behalf of
Keating's Lincoln Savings and Loan. But she contended, ``I didn't
think it was unusual.''
   She testified that she was aware of a second meeting a week
later that all five of the senators under investigation held with
San Francisco-based regulators. She said she asked if she should
plan to attend and Cranston said the senators did not want aides
present.
   ``It didn't really strike me as unusual when he said it was
about Lincoln,'' she said. ``Just in the back of my mind I assumed
they were going to talk about some of the background information
about the examination'' regulators were conducting at Lincoln.
   Those meetings have emerged as crucial in the ethics panel's
investigation of allegations the five senators improperly
intervened with regulators on behalf of Keating.
   Jordan acknowledged visiting Keating's American Continental
Corp. parent company in Phoenix in late 1986, where she gave a
speach to management and toured its facilities. Her trip was paid
for by a California-based thrift industry association, she said,
and Keating's company paid for her lodging.
   That visit was just a few months before Cranston attended the
meetings on behalf of Lincoln.
   The ethics panel is investigating allegations the five senators
improperly intervened with regulators on behalf of Keating, who
contributed $1.3 million to the lawmakers and their causes.
   In addition to Cranston, those under investigation are Sens.
John McCain, R-Ariz., Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; John Glenn,
D-Ohio, and Donald Riegle, D-Mich.
   Keating has been charged in California with fraud stemming from
the sale of junk bonds, largely to elderly investors who became
victims of the Lincoln collapse.

   Iraq has placed 20,000 more troops in and
around Kuwait in the past week, expanding the Iraqi armed force in
the area to more than half a million soldiers, the Pentagon
announced today.
   The United States buildup also is continuing. Pentagon spokesman
Pete Williams said today that an additional 10,000 U.S. troops have
arrived in the Persian Gulf area since last week, increasing the
total U.S. force there to 260,000.
   Williams also said that more than 220,000 ground, sea and air
forces of other allied nations are arrayed against Iraq. These
include forces from Britain, France, Egypt, Syria and several gulf
nations, including Saudi Arabia.
   Last week, the Pentagon said Iraq had sent 480,000 troops to
Kuwait and southern Iraq. That represented an increase of 30,000
from the week before.
   Williams described the latest additions to the Iraqi force as
``a rounding out of existing brigades'' committed to the occupation
of Kuwait, rather than the arrival there of newly activated
brigades. He said U.S. intelligence sources had not detected any
increase in the 4,000 Iraqi tanks in the area.
   Bush administration officials have cited the continuing buildup
of Iraqi forces in Kuwait and southern Iraq as a sign that
President Saddam Hussein does not intend to comply with UN
resolutions demanding his withdrawal from Kuwait.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said in a speech Monday that
Saddam Hussein ``has given us absolutely no indication whatsoever
of any intention'' of withdrawing from Kuwait and allowing the
restoration of the exiled Kuwaiti monarchy.
   Williams also disclosed today that the administration planned to
ask allied nations such as Germany, Japan and Korea for additional
financial contributions to help defray the cost of Operation Desert
Shield. He said he could not say when the requests would be made,
nor by which member of the administration.
   The Pentagon, meanwhile, is continuing to add air and ground
forces to Operation Desert Shield.
   The Air Force is sending more F-15 Eagle fighter jets to the
Persian Gulf to expand U.S. offensive capabilities against Iraq,
and the Army is ordering more National Guard and Reserve soldiers
to active duty.
   The Pentagon announced on Monday that elements of the 36th
Tactical Fighter Wing at Bitburg, Germany will deploy to the Middle
East starting Dec. 28. Officials declined to say how many of the 72
planes based at Bitburg are being sent.
   The Air Force in recent days has disclosed deployments of a
variety of additional aircraft to the gulf, including F-117A
``stealth'' fighter-bombers, F-111 medium-range bombers, A-10 tank
killers and OA-10 observation planes.
   The additional aircraft are part of a broad-based reinforcement
of U.S. deployments in and around Saudi Arabia, including more than
100,000 extra ground forces, more than 30,000 extra Marines and
three additional aircraft carrier battle groups. Tens of thousands
of reservists are being called up to support the reinforcement.
   The F-15s from Bitburg will give the United States greater
air-to-air combat capability in the event of war with Iraq. The
aircraft are armed with Sidewinder and Sparrow missiles and a 20mm
Gatling gun.
   An undisclosed number of F-15s were dispatched to the Gulf in
August from the 1st Tactical Fighter Wing at Langley Air Force
Base, Va., and from the 4th Tactical Fighter Wing at Seymour
Johnson Air Force Base, N.C.
   In its announcement, the Army said it ordered to active duty
1,457 members of National Guard and Reserve units in 20 states to
provide a variety of support services, including cargo transport,
medical service and civil affairs.
   The Army activations brought to 121,940 the number of reservists
called to active duty in all four services. Of that total, 90,186
are from the Army National Guard or Reserve.

   In the last major evacuation of hostages,
three more chartered flights left Iraq, carrying hundreds of
foreign captives freed by President Saddam Hussein. Only a few were
Americans.
   Two British chartered Iraqi Airways Boeing 707s brought 240
foreigners, mostly Britons, from Kuwait to the Iraqi capital. A
third American charter returned to the Iraqi capitial with only one
Irishman and two Canadians aboard. There were no Americans on any
of the flights from Kuwait.
   ``We must have gotten them all,'' said one American consular
official, referring to earlier evacuation flights from the emirate
and speaking on condition of anonymity.
   About 160 Japanese, including 14 diplomats from the Japanese
Embassy in Kuwait, left Baghdad today on a flight for Bangkok,
Thailand. Diplomats said just 14 Americans were on the charter
flights that left Baghdad today.
   Seven were among the 310 people, mostly Britons, on the flight
that left for London. Seven more were among the 16 passengers on
the American-chartered Iraqi Airways 707 to Frankfurt. The others
included an Irishman, two Canadians and six Britons.
   The White House said today that Thursday's evacuation flight of
Americans from Iraq and Kuwait is ``likely to be the last'' and
would probably also carry home the remaining staff of the U.S.
Embassy in Kuwait.
   ``We would anticipate that once all Americans who want out have
been able to get out that we would remove the entire staff of the
embassy,'' said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Ambassador Nathaniel Howell and members of his staff had long
defied Iraq's orders following its Aug. 2 seizure of Kuwait that
they abandon the compound. They and the British have had to cope
with deprivation after Iraqi troops cut off electricity and water.
   President Bush has said he would close the Kuwait embassy once
all Americans have been evacuated.
   Not all of the estimated 600 U.S. citizens left in Iraq and
Kuwait were expected to leave. Diplomats said about 400 were
expected to remain in Iraq, mainly people with dual U.S.-Iraqi
citizenship or American spouses of Iraqi citizens.
   British Embassy officials said about 150 Britons in Iraq and
Kuwait intended to stay for various reasons.
   Saddam on Thursday announced he was letting all Westerners go,
and the first flights of people subsequently freed began Sunday.
   More than 150 freed Americans arrived at Andrews Air Force Base
outside Washington on Monday, and more than 500 former hostages
flew into London. There were other flights to Italy and Jordan.

   A 72-year-old man who lived in a flophouse
and shaved his head to save money died with $11,000 hidden in
coffee cans and $22,000 in a bank.
   Charlie Haines rented a grimy $80-a-month downtown apartment,
where he was found dead Sunday, apparently of natural causes. His
only obvious possessions were a small color television, a
collection of hats and a footlocker filled with papers and
pictures.
   ``He probably had the first dime he ever made and he was always
worried'' somebody was going to get it, neighbor Ray Church said
Monday.
   A police officer and a deputy coroner found $11,241 in cash in
coffee cans, boxes and clothing, authorities said. Haines also had
$22,141 in a bank account that hadn't been touched in months. He
received a veteran's pension of $563 a month, authorities said.
   ``He probably lived on $30 a month, did his own cooking and even
shaved his own head'' to avoid having to pay for haircuts, Church
said.
   The money was turned over to Spokane County Treasurer Skip
Chilberg by Coroner Graham McConnell, who said he found no will and
there was no known next of kin in Spokane. Under state law, the
money will be held for six years and then forfeited to the state
unless an heir is located, Chilberg said.

<TEXT>
   Investigators removed a body from a pauper's
cemetery in a southern suburb today and plan to examine it to
determine if it is that of candy heiress Helen Brach, who
disappeared 13 years ago.
   Federal, state and county authorities were on the scene in
Willow Springs, but officials refused to comment immediately.
   They were looking for the body of a woman found dead in woods in
south suburban Calumet City in 1978, according to reports in the
Chicago Tribune.
   It was not immediately clear whether authorities had exhumed the
correct body.
   ``We developed additional information, which we felt significant
enough to warrant a re-examination of the body,'' Jerry Singer, a
spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms,
said Monday.
   He declined to describe the new information.
   Mrs. Brach, heiress to the Brach Candy Co. fortune, disappeared
at age 65 in 1977 in Rochester, Minn.
   Her net worth then was estimated at $17 million. Her estate is
now valued at more than $50 million. After she was declared dead in
1984, most of her money went to the Helen Brach Foundation, a
charitable trust.
   Authorities want to conduct genetic testing on the body,
although Cook County Medical Examiner Robert J. Stein concluded in
1978 that the body was not Mrs. Brach's. The unidentified body was
then buried in a pauper's cemetery.
   The Tribune, citing unidentified sources, said the dead woman
was missing her hands and part of her face, including her teeth.
That made it impossible to compare Mrs. Brach's dental records with
those of the body.
   Although Singer declined to describe the new evidence, the
Tribune reported the renewed interest in the case stemmed from a
federal investigation in Chicago into horse traders suspected of
defrauding wealthy people. The newspaper said a former boyfriend of
Mrs. Brach's figures in the probe.
   One theory suggests that Mrs. Brach was slain after she
repeatedly complained to authorities that she had been defrauded in
the purchase of horses, the newspaper said.
   Mrs. Brach was the widow of Frank V. Brach, former head of the
Brach Candy Co. He died in 1970.

   A new contraceptive touted by family planning
experts as the most effective, reversible method of birth control
will soon be available to American women.
   The Food and Drug Administration approved Norplant on Monday,
clearing the way for Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories to begin training
health practitioners how to insert the implant that can prevent
pregnancy for up to five years.
   ``It's going to be interesting to watch what kind of reaction
Norplant gets among the public and physicians,'' said Jeannie
Rosoff, president of the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a research and
policy group that focuses on reproductive health issues.
   ``There are going to be some women for whom this is a godsend.
The numbers we don't know yet,'' she said. ``But any new addition
that is safe is desirable.''
   Susan Dauley, who underwent a test implant six years ago, told a
news conference in New York today she decided to do it again. ``It
just took a few minutes,'' Mrs. Dauley said. ``You hardly feel
anything.''
   Family planning experts say Norplant is the first major new
contraceptive available to American women in three decades, since
the birth control pill was approved in 1960 and a new generation of
intrauterine devices, or IUDs, became available around that same
time.
   Norplant was approved in Finland in 1983 and has been approved
in 15 countries since then. Half a million women in those countries
have used it, according to The Population Council, which developed
the device.
   Norplant consists of six thin, flexible capsules, each about an
inch and a third long. They are inserted in a fan-like arrangement
under the skin of a woman's inner arm above the elbow. The minor
surgical procedure is done in 10 to 15 minutes with local
anesthesia in a doctor's office or a clinic.
   The capsules contain a hormone that is released slowly over five
years. The implants can be removed any time and fertility is
quickly restored.
   Norplant is 99 percent effective for women weighing less than
150 pounds. It may be less effective in heavier women, according to
the council.
   It will be marketed by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories of Philadelphia
and company officials expect the drug to be available commercially
in February.
   Dr. Marc W. Deitch, medical director at Wyeth-Ayerst, said the
company won't discuss the cost of Norplant until it goes on the
market, probably in February. But he said it will cost less than
five years' worth of birth control pills.
   ``That's the controlling factor,'' said Dr. Amy Pollack,
associate medical director for the Planned Parenthood Federation.
   C. Wayne Bardin, vice president and director of medical research
for The Population Council, said last week he had been told the
price would be in the range of $200 to $300, not including the cost
of implanting the device.
   One group for whom Norplant is likely to be popular is women who
have had all the children they want but aren't sure they want to be
sterilized.
   Sterilization is the leading method of birth control for married
couples in the United States. In 1988, in nearly 40 percent of
married couples in which the woman was between 15 and 44,
sterilization was used, according to the National Center for Health
Statistics.
   ``Many make that decision (to be sterilized) for lack of another
choice,'' Pollack said.
   Some, however, may not like Norplant's side effect. The major
one is menstrual irregularities, including prolonged periods and
spotting between periods. About 15 percent of the women who have
the implant have it removed because of bleeding, according to the
council's studies.
   Other side effects include occasional headaches, mood changes,
nausea and acne, the FDA said.

   The White House could unveil an economic
assistance package for the Soviet Union as early as Wednesday when
President Bush meets with Soviet Foreign Secretary Eduard A.
Shevardnadze, administration officials said today.
   Meanwhile, a U.S. study indicates there is no widespread hunger
in the Soviet Union and adequate food supplies exist - if
authorities can just get it distributed.
   Administration officials, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said that an aid proposal that could include emergency
food shipments was on Bush's desk awaiting his final approval.
   It is likely that Bush will want to announce the steps on
Wednesday when the Soviet official is here, the sources said.
   It was not immediately clear what the package would entail, but
Bush has been considering lifting trade restrictions in place since
1974 as well as a separate proposal to grant Moscow $2 billion in
loan guarantees to buy U.S. food.
   Furthermore, the package was expected to include emergency
medical supplies and possibly direct food shipments - particularly
in light of Shevardnadze's request in Houston on Monday for food.
   An aid package for Moscow ``is being discussed,'' presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
   Fitzwater noted that Baker and Shevardnadze planned to hold a
joint news conference later today and ``I don't want to prejudge
any announcements.''
   However, other officials said that, while the package might be
alluded to at the Baker-Shevardnadze news conference, specific
details most likely would not be laid out until Wednesday.
   The administration said Monday it is considering several ways to
help the beleaguered Soviets get through the winter, including
direct humanitarian aid as well as waiving longstanding trade
restrictions to loosen up credit.
   Shevardnadze bluntly appealed for U.S. aid before a meeting
Monday with Baker.
   ``We would appreciate, if possible, some food supplies,'' he
said in reply to a question from a reporter. ``That is the most
acute problem.''
   Baker pledged a sympathetic response. ``As far as humanitarian
assistance, medical assistance, food and that sort of thing, I know
the president will be forthcoming with respect to trying to help,''
the secretary said.
   Fitzwater said Monday that Bush is considering waiving trade
restrictions imposed by the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, which was
designed to punish the Soviets for refusing to permit free
emigration of Jews.
   Bush had pledged to hold up granting the Soviets
most-favored-nation trade status until the Soviet legislature
passes new emigration legislation. But the measure has been tied up
for months, partly due to concern among some Soviets that it would
lead to a ``brain drain,'' a mass exodus of the troubled country's
best-trained people. Nonetheless, Jews are being permitted to leave
in record numbers.
   Fitzwater said the administration was motivated by the Soviets'
cooperation in the Persian Gulf crisis and by ``a very serious need
in terms of their economy and in terms of their ability to get food
supplies'' distributed to Moscow and other major cities.
   Meanwhile, a top State Department official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said a U.S. study of the Soviet consumer
goods shortage confirms there is no widespread hunger in the
country and that adequate food is available if authorities can get
it distributed.
   ``The medical supply problem is deeper,'' the official said,
``and we're looking at working with private groups to help relieve
that situation.'' AmeriCares, a private relief agency, recently
announced it was dispatching 40 tons of medical supplies to the
Soviet Union. Japan also has promised medical assistance.
   Although Germany and several other Western European countries
are organizing food aid programs, the U.S. government still sees no
immediate need for such relief, the official said.
   Several European countries, following the lead of the Germans,
are shipping food to the Soviets despite transportation logjams
that have left many tons of supplies sitting on rail sidings with
no place to unload.
   Several leaders have said the aid program is necessary to shore
up Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, whose popularity and
authority have been battered by the deepening crisis.
   U.S. observers say the Europeans appear to be motivated at least
partly by the fear that severe shortages, coupled with the Soviets'
easing of travel restrictions, could cause a mass exodus of people
fleeing the Soviet Union for the more prosperous countries of
Western Europe.
   Gorbachev has pledged to crack down on black marketeering and
boost food imports to ease the food crisis.
   He installed a longtime KGB officer and an army general at the
top of the Interior Ministry to tighten domestic control in the
face of deteriorating order and growing squabbles with the
country's 15 republics. And he announced formation of vigilante
committees to crack down on theft and diversion of food supplies
from established channels.

   Hundreds of foreigners, including about a dozen Americans, left
Iraq today as the exodus of hostages drew to a close. But tensions
remained high in the Persian Gulf as Iraq and the United States
both bolstered their forces.
   Earlier today, two Iraqi Airways Boeing 707s chartered by
Britain brought 240 foreigners, mostly Britons, from Kuwait to the
Iraqi capital.
   A third American charter returned to the Iraqi capitial with
only one Irishman and two Canadians aboard. There were no Americans
on any of the flights from Kuwait.
   ``We must have gotten them all,'' said one American consular
official, referring to earlier evacuation flights from the emirate
and speaking on condition of anonymity.
   About 160 Japanese, including 14 diplomats from the Japanese
Embassy in Kuwait, left Baghdad today on a flight for Bangkok,
Thailand.
   Diplomats said just 14 Americans were on the charter flights
that left Baghdad today. Seven were among the 310 people, mostly
Britons, on the flight that left for London. Seven more were among
the 16 passengers on the American-chartered Iraqi Airways 707 to
Frankfurt, Germany. The others included an Irishman, two Canadians
and six Britons.
   The White House said today that Thursday's evacuation flight of
Americans from Iraq and Kuwait is ``likely to be the last'' and
would probably also carry home the remaining staff of the U.S.
Embassy in Kuwait.
   ``We would anticipate that once all Americans who want out have
been able to get out that we would remove the entire staff of the
embassy,'' said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   In another development today, the Pentagon announced that Iraq
has placed 20,000 more troops in and around Kuwait in the past
week, expanding the Iraqi armed force in the area to more than half
a million soldiers.
   The United States buildup also is continuing.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said today that an additional
10,000 U.S. troops have arrived in the Persian Gulf area since last
week, increasing the total U.S. force there to 260,000.
   Williams also said that more than 220,000 ground, sea and air
forces of other allied nations are arrayed against Iraq. These
include forces from Britain, France, Egypt, Syria and several gulf
nations, including Saudi Arabia.
   On Monday, President Bush lashed out at Saddam in a speech
clearly aimed at limiting the Iraqi president's publicity gains
from releasing foreign hostages.
   ``What has happened to Kuwait is more than an invasion,'' Bush
said. ``It is a systematic assault on the soul of a nation.''
   For months after his troops seized Kuwait, Saddam prevented many
foreigners from leaving Iraq and Kuwait - sometimes freeing
Westerners only after receiving prominent emissaries from abroad.
   Last week, he said all those who wanted to leave could do so.
   Iraqi Information Minister Latif Jassim, meanwhile, denied news
reports that Baghdad might withdraw from Kuwait if it can keep the
southern tip of the Rumailah oil field, which extends for two miles
into Kuwait. Before Iraq overran Kuwait on Aug. 2, Saddam accused
Kuwait of overexploiting the field.
   ``Kuwait is Iraqi, whether in the past, present or future and we
will not compromise one iota on Kuwaiti territory,'' Jassim said.
   In his condemnation of Iraqi atrocities, Bush drew on the
reports of some of the hundreds of foreigners who have left Iraq
and Kuwait.
   They included hostages held as ``human shields'' at strategic
sites and men who hid out in Kuwait after the invasion.
   More than 150 Americans arrived at Andrews Air Force Base
outside Washington on Monday, and more than 500 other former
hostages flew into London. Other flights carried foreigners to
Italy and Jordan.
   The experiences related by the hostages ranged from terrifying
to unpleasant to tedious.
   ``For the most part, it was boring,'' said Gale Rogers, a
consular officer at the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait.
   With fresh water and electricity cut off by the Iraqis, the
Americans were without air conditioning in the summer. The air was
``hot with flies'' in the summer and ``cold with flies'' in the
winter, Rogers said.
   For Tom Kreuzman, 38, of Holiday, Fla., the four-month period
included 23 days hiding in a crawl space and eating dry spaghetti.
   His Scottish terrier, Chu Chu, accompanied Kreuzman through the
ordeal but was lost at Baghdad airport on Sunday, he said.
   ``It's a tragedy,'' said the former U.S. Air Force serviceman,
who worked for the Kuwaiti Defense Ministry as a technician on
their Hawk missile system. ``She made it that far. She went through
a lot with me over there.''
   While Iraq says the hostage release does not mean it will leave
Kuwait, Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz said compromise could be
reached on the dates for upcoming talks with the United States.
Aziz was quoted by The New York Times today as saying Saddam was
reconsidering his demand that Secretary of State James A. Baker III
visit on Jan. 12.
   U.S. officials have said Jan. 12 would be too late because it
falls three days before the deadline established by the U.N.
Security Council for Iraq to quit Kuwait or face the likelihood of
being attacked.
   President Bush proposed the talks on Nov. 30, a day after the
U.N. resolution was approved, and Aziz is to travel to Washington
this month for talks with Bush.
   Bush plans to have at least 400,000 troops in the Persian Gulf
region by mid-January. The multinational force arrayed against Iraq
also includes about 100,000 troops from other nations.

<HEAD>Congressional Investigators Say EPA Lax on Cleanup Fraud</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional investigators accused auditors
at the Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday of not
aggressively pursuing potential fraud by private contractors
involved in millions of dollars in environmental cleanup programs.
   But the EPA's inspector general, John Martin,
   told a House subcommittee he stands by his office's work and
said its investigations have led to 250 indictments since 1984 as
well as the recovery of $16 million in fines through administrative
actions.
   Investigators for both the House Energy and Commerce Committee
and for the General Accounting Office testified that hundreds of
EPA contracts have not been audited because of backlogs. And in
some cases, they said, questions of possible fraud have not been
pursued adequately.
   Three subcommittee investigators acknowledged, however, that
their year-long investigation uncovered no actual proof of fraud or
evidence of deliberate wrongdoing by EPA auditors.
   ``This subcommittee is concerned that the public is not getting
its money's worth in environmental protection from these large
contract expenditures,'' said Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman
of the Energy and Commerce Committee.
   The panel's subcommittee on oversight and investigation has been
examining complaints about the work of the EPA's inspector
general's office for more than a year.
   A subcommittee report said the findings indicate that the IG's
office ``has failed to effectively pursue waste, fraud and abuse''
that may be occurring by the agency's major private contractors.
The EPA has contracts with private firms valued at more than $8.6
billion, many of them involving toxic waste cleanup under the
Superfund program.
   The GAO report said that most of EPA's contracts dating back
four years have yet to be audited because of a backlog both within
the EPA and at the Defense Contract Audit Agency, which handles may
of the contract reviews for the agency.
   The Defense audit agency has 273 outstanding requests for
contract audits from the EPA as of the end of last month, with 40
percent of them made more than two years ago, said the GAO
investigators.
   Of the more than $1 billion in contracts between the EPA and six
major private contractors between 1983 and 1990, only a small
number have ever been audited, said GAO investigator Richard
Hembra.
   Martin, who has been the EPA's inspector general since late
1983, said the congressional investigators ``have not found fraud.
... They have not found anything wrong that we did not find
already. ... They found it in our files.''
   He strongly defended the agency's office of investigations,
saying they ``have no objective other than putting the bad guys in
jail.''

<HEAD>Police Ordered To Arrest Ousted President</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said Tuesday they were ordered
to arrest Hussain Muhammad Ershad, the president who was ousted
last week in a popular uprising against what opponents called his
corrupt government.
   Police put former Home Minister Mahmudul Hassan, a close aide of
Ershad, under house arrest and sought other former Cabinet
ministers and top officials in Ershad's government, said a senior
police officer.
   Most of Ershad's close associates went into hiding for fear of
mob violence. At least 12 homes were raided by police searching for
them, the officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Another ranking officer said he expected Ershad to be arrested
early Wednesday. It was not clear whether he would be jailed or
kept under guard at his exclusive home in the Cantonment, a
restricted military area of Dhaka.
   Ershad, who has been in seclusion, would not accept telephone
calls from reporters Tuesday.
   The former general, who seized power in a 1982 coup, could face
charges of subverting the constitution in connection with alleged
vote rigging in two parliamentary elections and a presidential
election. He may also be accused of unlawful business deals,
according to opposition politicians who have pressed for his
arrest.
   As home minister, Mahmudul was in charge of the police and the
paramilitary forces that tried to suppress seven weeks of often
violent demonstrations seeking Ershad's resignation.
   A member of Ershad's inner circle, Mahmudul was on the crisis
team that advised Ershad to decree a state of emergency on Nov. 27.
The measure failed to quell the street protests, and Ershad quit
when the army also deserted him.
   Diplomatic sources estimated 60 people were killed in Dhaka and
another 40 in other trouble spots around the country. Most were
shot by Mahmudul's security forces.
   Five policemen armed with rifles Tuesday stood inside the gate
of Mahmudul's enclosed home in the luxurious Gulshan district in
the capital. Other policemen were on patrol on the street.
   The caretaker government headed by Supreme Court chief justice
Shahabuddin Ahmed has been under intense pressure from political
parties and university students to try Ershad on charges of
corruption and abusing power during his eight-year rule.
   But a trial could involve tricky legal questions about
presidential immunity and rake up emotions at a time when the
country should prepare for its first free election in a decade. The
interim government is committed to holding a vote within three
months.
   Shahabuddin privately discussed sending Ershad into exile. But
the idea met a cool reception from most political parties, which
demanded a trial.
   Sheik Hasina, leader of the powerful Awami League, left the
possibility open.
   ``We want a Bangladesh without Ershad,'' she said Tuesday. ``I
don't mind if that is achieved by his arrest and trial or by
throwing him out of the country.''
   The interim administration has removed civic leaders, heads of
public companies and at least three top army officers who were
appointed by Ershad or considered close to him.

   An Austrian group has chosen a Japanese composer's
arrangement of a requiem left unfinished by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
to mark the 200th anniversary of the composer's death, it was
announced Tuesday.
   The International Stiftung Mozarteum, an organization devoted to
Mozart research, chose Shigeaki Saigusa's ``Symphonic Concerto for
Violin, Viola, Cello and Orchestra.'' It is to be performed Dec. 5,
1991, the anniversary date.
   Saigusa's composition is a completed version of Mozart's
unfinished ``Requiem Mass.'' Mozart was commissioned to write the
work in the summer of 1791 but died before completing it.
   One of his students, Franz Xavier Sussmayr, completed a version
of the work after Mozart died later that year.
   But, said Saigusa, ``Sussmayr's version was written in a style
too `romantic' to suit Mozart's composition. ... The Stiftung
Mozarteum asked me to write my own version.''
   ``I tried to return to his state of mind,'' said Saigusa, one of
Japan's foremost composers of classical music.
   He said his composition will be recorded in May and released
next August.

   A 12-foot-long python kept
armed soldiers at bay after it slithered into a classroom in a
primary school in neighboring Swaziland, the South African Press
Association reported Tuesday.
   The news agency said the soldiers were called to the school
Monday to remove an ``intruder'' but backed away in shock when they
saw the snake. The soldiers, teachers and students watched from a
distance as four local men stuffed the python into a sack and took
it away.
   The snake apparently entered the classroom during lessons and
was coiled in a corner, gazing at the blackboard, when a student
noticed it.
   Swaziland is a small country surrounded on three sides by South
Africa and also bordering Mozambique.

<HEAD>KGB Chief Says Foreign Powers Trying to Destabilize Soviet Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the KGB security police said in a
nationally televised speech today that foreign powers are backing
radicals in the Soviet Union, and he vowed to restore ``law and
order.''
   ``Forces are striving to achieve power,'' KGB Chairman Vladimir
Kryuchkov said in an address that appeared to be the sharpest
warning yet that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was planning a
major crackdown.
   ```Democracy' and `glasnost' will just remain beautiful words
unless there is law and order in society,'' said Kryuchkov,
outlining part of Gorbachev's campaign to curtail corruption and
economic crimes.
   Gorbachev has ordered the KGB and other state security agencies
to stem the flow of food and consumer goods from the centralized
state distribution system.
   Authorities claim that the goods are showing up on the black
market and that ``speculation'' is responsible for food shortages
in the country.
   Despite the declared end to the Cold War, Kryuchkov seemed to
revert to th rhetoric of an earlier era in warning that foreign
governments were encouraging radical elements in Soviet society.
   ``The growing of some ultra-radical movements is not at all
accidental but deliberate. Some of them have material and financial
support from abroad,'' he said, without saying which foreign
countries he was referring to.

<HEAD>Famed British Museum Reading Room Is Saved For Readers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British Museum's celebrated domed reading
room, where Marx, Lenin and Gandhi pondered ways to change the
world, will remain the hushed preserve of readers and thinkers, the
museum said Tuesday.
   The announcement ended half a century of argument over the fate
of the reading room, beloved by generations of scholars for its
cerebral but cozy atmosphere.
   The reading room's 18 million books will be moved to the new
British Library in the next three years, museum director Sir David
Wilson announced.
   But the circular chamber, with its cathedral-style windows and
concentric rings of reference-book shelves, will remain a reading
room.
   The room, built in 1857, will even be redecorated in its
original 19th-cetury style.
   ``I hope this will settle the argument,'' Wilson said.
   The reading room's fate had been uncertain since just after
World War II, when the museum proposed to knock down 7{ acres of
surrounding historic Bloomsbury for a new library and modern
reading room.
   The plan was quashed by the government in 1967 after objections
from residents and conservationists.
   In 1978, when the government approved building the new British
Library, scheduled for completion in the mid-1990s, there was fresh
uproar about the potential loss of the reading room.
   Devotees feared it would become just another display area in the
museum, or even face eventual demolition.
   Academics and writers set up a committee to keep the room as a
library and prevent a ``considerable loss of amenity and historic
connection.''
   Karl Marx and Lenin used the reading room. Lenin's application
for a ``reader's ticket'' - needed to use the room - is on display,
signed under his alias, Jacob Richter.
   The reading room was also a haunt of Indian independence leader
Mohandas K. Gandhi, playwright George Bernard Shaw, historian
Thomas Carlyle and novelist Thomas Hardy.
   Poet Algernon Swinburne once fainted in the reading room on
being ``overcome by the close atmosphere,'' an official recorded.
   Wilson made his announcement about the reading room's future in
unveiling an $155 million plan for using the new space the museum
will acquire when the books are moved to the new national library,
half a mile away.
   The redecoration of the room will also include a glass entrance
for the public to see in, he said.
   After the reading room's collection of books is moved, Wilson
said some of the 100,000 volumes belonging to the museum's
ethnography department would be housed there.
   He also said books on ``one or two other subjects which are in
demand'' would be available in the reading room. And it will be
open for study of any of the 8 million objects in the British
Museum, he said.
   The room is shaped like a bicycle wheel, with a circular inquiry
desk at the hub. Lines of reading desks radiate outward like
spokes, with 300 places for readers.
   The circular interior wall, under huge windows, has three tiers
of books with galleries running around them.
   Out of sight behind the walls are the 12 million books available
to readers. Another 6 million books in the reading room's
collection are housed in 16 separate locations in London. All 18
million volumes will be united in the new library, being built at a
cost of $953 million.

   Shipley, Roberta Lawson, and James Hampton each received four

southwest of Portland.
   The three-way tie was broken with a kiss in accordance with a
state law requiring the council member to be selected by lot.
   Shipley, 23, drew the winning chocolate Kiss from a sack Monday
night.
   The drawing was delayed for a few minutes while Recorder Karin
Johnson searched for the sack she'd brought with two green-wrapped
candies and one red. It turned out that one of the council members
had eaten the red one.
   It all worked out, though. Hampton withdrew from the race,
leaving two candies and two candidates. Johnson marked one candy
with an X, and Shipley drew it.
   Lawson also won. Later in the meeting, the council appointed her
to fill another vacant council seat.

   Eight Americans boarded a U.S. chartered
aircraft today in Iraq, leaving just three remaining to be
evacuated so far as is known, State Department officials said.
   The officials said they believe all other Americans who wanted
to leave Iraq and Kuwait have done so. But another flight is
scheduled for Thursday to pick up any who may not have made their
presence known to U.S. officials.
   That flight is ``likely to be the last,'' said White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``We would anticipate that once all Americans who want out have
been able to get out that we would remove the entire staff of the
embassy,'' said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Other officials, asking not to be identified, said the three
Americans yet to be evacuated all were used as ``human shields''
and have not yet been allowed to leave because of visa problems.
   No Americans boarded the Boeing 707 in Kuwait today and eight
got on in Baghdad, the officials said. The flight then departed for
Frankfurt.
   Meanwhile, those who came back to the United States on Monday
said they were relieved to be free after more than four
frightening, boring and unpleasant months as captives.
   ``It feels absolutely great,'' Jack Rinehart, 37, of Stover,
Mo., said several hours after he and more than 150 Americans landed
at nearby Andrews Air Force Base, Md., on a chartered Pan Am jumbo
jet.
   ``It's great to be back,'' said Dwight Durmon of Fayetteville,
Tenn., as he clutched the hand of his wife, Cathy.
   At the White House today, Fitzwater noted that the second plane
load of Americans had left Iraq about noon. He said that those
Americans would be flown back to the United States on Wednesday by
military charter.
   The final evacuation flight, now scheduled for Thursday, ``is
likely to be the last and it is also likely to be the one to
evacuate U.S. Embassy personnel from Kuwait,'' Fitzwater said.
   While he adhered to a U.S. policy of not revealing the number
inside the besieged embassy in Kuwait City, Fitzwater said:
``suffice it to say, it's a small group.''
   He said that the United States technically would consider the
embassy ``an active and open embassy available for work whenever we
should want to do that.''
   But, ``from a practical matter, we won't have anyone there to
raise the flag,'' he added.
   ``While the president is very happy to see the individual
hostages being released, he has watched some of it on television
... the president shares what I'm sure is everyone's concern and
disgust with some of the stories that are being told of harassment
and deprivation during their captivity,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``We watch this process with a certain amount of caution in the
sense that it's not completed yet. And we won't be happy until
everyone is out,'' he added.
   The first group of former hostages - some of whom had been held
as ``human shields'' at strategic sites in Iraq - left Baghdad on
Sunday.
   They spent the night in Frankfurt, Germany, before coming to the
United States. Last week, the Iraqi parliament voted to allow the
8,000 American, European and Japanese hostages to go free.
   Monday's flight carried 156 people, including four Canadians.
Fitzwater refused to say how many Americans remained in Iraq and
Kuwait.
   Ivan Selin, the State Department's undersecretary for
management, greeted the evacuees. They then were whisked away - out
of sight of hordes of reporters - for private reunions with their
families.
   The ex-hostages spent the night in the capital, and some said
they expected to be debriefed by U.S. officials.
   Rinehart, an electrical engineer who was on a sales trip to
Kuwait when Iraqi troops invaded the country Aug. 2, was holed up
at the embassy compound for his entire stay.
   ``I was the camp plumber,'' said Rinehart, explaining how the
embassy staff and the private citizens inside kept themselves
occupied during the siege. Some people cooked, cleaned and guarded
the complex. Rinehart said he helped dig a 14-foot water well.
   ``For the most part, it was boring,'' said Gale Rogers, a
consular officer at the Kuwait embassy.
   Life at the embassy also was uncomfortable. Without fresh water
and electricity, the Americans were without air conditioning in the
summer. The air was ``hot with flies'' in the summer and ``cold
with flies'' in the winter, Rogers said.
   The Americans ate mainly rice and tuna fish with different
sauces, a diet that caused Rinehart to lose 25 pounds, he said.
   Rogers, of Arlington, Va., said the Americans were afraid at
times, particularly right after the invasion. ``The threat is there
all the time if you can't go home and you can't leave,'' he said.
   But private citizens hiding in Kuwait were even more frightened
because they were subject to arrest and could be picked up in
house-to-house searches. ``Many are afraid to sleep at night,''
Rogers said.
   Durmon said that in Iraq, people are afraid of the secret
police. ``The secret police there are surveilling you,'' he said.
   Durmon said he was in Kuwait but later was moved to Iraq. He
declined to say what his job was.
   Those who left Kuwait on Sunday said the country is in chaos
with roads destroyed, street lights knocked out and wrecked cars
everywhere. ``Everything is broken,'' Rogers said.

<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new chairman of the House science
committee said Tuesday that America's space station will be pushed
into the next century if the broad changes sought by the
administration's space advisory panel are implemented.
   Rep. George Brown, D-Calif., called Monday's recommendations of
the Advisory Committee on the Future of the U.S. Space Program ``a
reasoned, balanced report.'' Both Brown and his Senate counterpart,
Al Gore, D-Tenn., plan hearings in January on the study
commissioned by NASA and the White House.
   The report recommended that reliance on the space shuttle be
reduced and that plans for Space Station Freedom be scaled down
both in scope and mission. It said, too, that NASA should
concentrate on science, not engineering spectaculars.
   NASA already had switched orbital delivery of some cargoes from
the space shuttle to unmanned, single-use rockets, and most of the
future shuttle missions are dedicated to science.
   The sixth and last flight of 1990 landed in California early
Tuesday after nine days of astronomical observations with four
telescopes. It was the 13th mission since flight resumed in 1988.
NASA has scheduled seven flights in 1991.
   Brown, elected by the House Democratic Caucus last week as
chairman of the Committee on Science, Space and Technology, said
that while the space future report is a good approach, ``I lament
that we are still in stage of going through reports,
re-evaluations, and redirections when the space program deserves
stability and adequate resources.''
   In passing the NASA budget for 1991, Congress also demanded that
the space station be made smaller and less costly - a move also
recommended by the space future panel. NASA is in the midst of a
90-day period of drawing up new designs.
   ``Another restructuring of the space station is going to make it
impossible to maintain the present schedule,'' Brown said. ``It
probably means we won't even get started on building the station
until the latter years of the '90s and there will be no occupancy
until the 21st Century.''
   The first shuttle flight to put hardware for the station into
orbit had been scheduled for 1995 and the station was to have been
permanently manned well before the year 2000.
   ``This further complicates relationships with our partners in
the station, the Japanese, Europeans and Canadians, who need to be
fully involved and have to modify their own participation as a
result of any changes we make,'' Brown said.
   The next shuttle mission - to deploy unclassified payloads for
the Air Force and the Strategic Defense Organization - is planned
for late February or early March, a welcome hiatus to crews that
had to handle three flights in as many months.
   ``After these three, I think Christmas is going to be a real
nice break,'' said flight director Bob Castle. ``We'll come back
from Christmas and be ready to go.''
   The planned 1991 missions include an April trip in which the
Gamma Ray Observatory is to be carried into orbit, and in May, a
space life sciences laboratory is to ride aboard Columbia.
   Discovery is to fly in July with another in a series of tracking
and data relay satellites, which gather information from other
satellites and space shuttles and send it to the ground.
   Atlantis is to fly in August with several Defense Department
payloads on a mission lasting 10 days. Discovery is scheduled again
in November with the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite; and the
final launch is that of Atlantis in December, carrying a manned
scientific laboratory in its cargo bay.
   The space future committee was headed by Norman R. Augustine, a
veteran aerospace executive who is chairman and CEO of the Martin
Marietta Company.
   Commenting on the report, NASA administrator Richard Truly
pointed out that despite leaks that grounded the shuttle and flaws
in the Hubble Space Telescope, NASA has averaged one launch in
every two months since shuttles returned to flight in 1988.
   He said it will not be difficult to adopt many of the
recommendations in the report.
   ``Frankly, I believe we are exactly in line with the Augustine
report and with Congress,'' he said.

<HEAD>Arts Leaders Urge National Endowment to Accept Risks</HEAD>

   The National Endowment for the Arts has a
special responsibility to protect freedom of artistic expression
and should support promising new works that might prove risky or
unpopular, a nonpartisan forum affiliated with Columbia University
said Tuesday.
   The report by The American Assembly also said the arts community
was ill-equipped to deal with the recent controversy over alleged
federal support for obscene and blasphemous works that once
threatened the NEA's existence.
   The public affairs forum's report summarized a four-day
conference of more than 70 business, government, foundation and
arts leaders last month at Arden House in Harriman, N.Y. A copy was
made available in Washington.
   The assembly was directed by Stephen Benedict, former director
of Columbia University's graduate program in arts administration,
and Steven Lavine, president of the California Institute of the
Arts at Valencia. Participants included NEA chairman John E.
Frohnmayer; John Brademas, president of New York University, and
Andrew Heiskell, chairman of the New York Public Library and former
chairman of Time Inc.
   Since the recent battle in Congress over imposing anti-obscenity
restrictions on federal arts grants, the forum said, the NEA ``has
a specially compelling responsibility to protect freedom of
expression, not only for the artists it supports but for every
artist.''
   The assembly leaders added that ``government policies and
private actions that threaten to curb artistic `speech' or to
constrict in any way the marketplace of ideas for the arts have no
place in American society and must be vigorously opposed.''
   The report noted that the NEA controversy was triggered by its
grants for exhibitions of sexually explicit photographs by the late
Robert Mapplethorpe and works by artist Andres Serrano that were
accused of being anti-religious.
   ``Government arts programs should support new work of promise
that may prove risky or unpopular,'' the forum said. ``Some art has
always been controversial and will continue to be, especially as
cultures and art forms become more diverse and the boundaries of
art continue to expand.''
   The assembly leaders said government grants must be administered
on the principle that ``no artist's work may be compromised,
suppressed or unrecognized because of race, ethnicity, gender,
sexual preference, or political or religious beliefs.''
   The forum said the arts community must overcome its differences
and develop new ways to build the case for public support of the
arts. It recommended a coalition with corporate executives willing
to serve as arts advocates with all levels of government.
   ``Arts advocacy can only succeed if all participants in the
process refrain from asserting their interests at the expense of
others,'' the forum said.
   In October, Congress repealed strict anti-obscenity curbs on the
NEA and voted instead to penalize grant recipients whose federally
subsidized works are ruled obscene by the courts.
   Legislation extending the NEA's statutory authority for three
years, with a first-year budget of $174 million, also required the
NEA chairman to ensure that grant awards take into account
``general standards of decency.''
   Members of the National Council on the Arts, the presidentially
appointed advisory body to the NEA, will confer informally this
weekend to discuss how the new ``decency'' guideline will affect
the endowment's grant-making decisions.

   The Communist victory in Serbia's
first free vote since 1938 creates a new crisis for Yugoslavia's
unity.
   The nation's fate hinges on whether the republic's hard-line
president chooses dialogue or conflict with his political
adversaries in Croatia and Slovenia.
   The two northern republics' moves for more independence, or even
secession, have angered Slobodan Milosevic, who defeated
center-right candidates in Serbia's presidential elections Sunday.
He is a leader of Serbia's Communists, who renamed themselves the
Socialist Party.
   The Socialists also were leading in Serbia's parliamentary
ballot.
   Milosevic's victory seems certain to widen the political gap
between north and south, speeding the drive for independence in the
Western-minded republics. It is also likely to keep ethnic
Albanians living in the once semi-autonomous Kosovo province under
direct Serbian rule.
   ``We now consider Serbia a sort of foreign partner for
negotiation,'' said Slaven Letica, a chief adviser to Croatia's
center-right president, Franjo Tudjman.
   ``We are willing to discuss to try and resolve the Yugoslav
crisis and we now consider Milosevic a democratically elected
president, but we don't know if he will negotiate with us,'' Letica
said.
   Tudjman's nationalist-oriented Croatian Democratic Union ousted
Communists in spring elections in Croatia. He has allied against
Milosevic with Slovenia, where center-right government parties also
defeated Communists at the polls.
   The northerners' parliaments have flouted federal laws and
proposed transforming Yugoslavia into a loose conferedation with a
common market. Serbia favors keeping power centralized in Belgrade,
the federal and Serbian capital.
   Before year's end, Croatia is to adopt a new constitution that
would pave the way for independence.
   Slovenia holds a plebiscite Dec. 23 on whether to stay in the
federation. The vote is seen as a last bargaining card to force
Serbia to negotiate on decentralization.
   A survey published in Slovenia's leading daily, Delo, following
Serbia's Sunday election indicated that 90 percent of Slovenians
plan to vote in the referendum. Only 1 percent said they opposed
independence.
   ``People here invested a lot of hope in those elections, hoping
things would change,'' Zoran Thaler, Slovenia's deputy foreign
minister, said of the Serbian balloting. ``Now we see it won't be
different.''
   Yugoslavia was formed from the wreckage of the Hapsburg and
Ottoman empires in 1918 as the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and
Slovenes. It held its last free elections in 1938.
   The nation was reassembled during World War II as a communist
republic. Only single-party elections were held after 1943.
   Like the rest of the Balkans, Yugoslavia is plagued by ancient,
unresolved ethnic conflicts, exacerbated by historic and economic
divisions.
   Milosevic has ruled Serbia, the largest of Yugoslavia's six
republics, with a firm hand since late 1987.
   Before Sunday's election, he refused to publicly acknowledge the
possibility of the federation's break-up or discuss the issue with
Slovenia and Croatia. It's unclear whether he will talk now with
Tudjman or Slovenia's president, Milan Kucan.
   ``We don't know if Milosevic after the elections will be the
same Milosevic as before the elections,'' said one central European
diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Western diplomats say Serbia might agree to Slovenian secession
to deprive Croatia of a political ally.
   It would be possible for tiny alpine Slovenia, whose 2 million
people are ethnically homogeneous, to make a clean break without
raising the country's ethnic tensions to a boiling point.
   But Croatia, home to 500,000 ethnic Serbs, could not. A
secession attempt could push the southern Slavs into civil war.
   Milosevic has said any attempts by Croatia to pull out of the
federation would force Serbia to redraw its borders to protect its
minorities.
   The central republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina, whose patchwork
population of Serbs, Croats and Moslems make it a miniature
Yugoslavia, likely would split along national lines in an armed
conflict.
   ``Yugoslavia has always seemed able to pull itself back from the
brink of self-destruction, but maybe not this time,'' said a
Western diplomat.
   The federal army, whose officer corps is dominated by Serbs and
their traditional allies from Montenegro, has indicated it could
intervene in Slovenia to preserve federal unity.
   Slovenia's government controls only a small local militia and
plans to appeal for Western diplomatic assistance if that happens.
   But anything other than symbolic help is unlikely.
   ``If (Soviet President Mikhail) Gorbachev sent troops into the
Baltics, the West wouldn't lift a finger, so why should they help
us?'' said a Slovenian government official who also spoke on
condition of anonymity.

   Lithuania's president said Tuesday that Moscow
will try to bring his rebellious republic to its knees this winter
by cutting off all supplies of food and raw materials.
   President Vytautas Landsbergis told a news conference that
Soviet officials have informed his government that food, fodder,
energy and material shipments to Lithuania will end on Jan. 1,
ostensibly because of shortages in the Soviet Union.
   ``All forces and all measures are going to be used to
destabilize the situation in Lithuania and force it to remain part
of the Soviet Union. They hope General Winter will be on their
side,''Landsbergis said.
   He said citizens in his Baltic state have begun storing reserves
for expected shortages and ``I am convinced this winter is going to
be a decisive one in our struggle.''
   Landsbergis met Monday with President Bush and was meeting Vice
President Dan Quayle on Tuesday to appeal for U.S. support in
Lithuania's drive to cast off Soviet rule and become an independent
state.
   Bush restated U.S. policy urging self-determination for the
Baltic states and a peaceful settlement to their differences with
Moscow. Landsbergis said he was confident Bush would not sacrifice
Lithuania to keep Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in power.
   Asked if Washington might overlook the Soviet use of force
against Lithuania in its eagerness to hold together the anti-Iraq
coalition, he said, ``especially after my meeting with President
Bush, I have absolutely no basis to think that way.''
   But Landsbergis also criticized the West in general for failing
to see Soviet pressure against Lithuania as an act of aggression.
He said the West gave in to the Soviets in not allowing the three
Baltic republics of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia to send
representatives to a 35-nation European conference in Paris two
weeks ago.
   He compared the situation in Lithuania, which was invaded and
annexed by Stalin in 1940, with that of occupied Kuwait. ``No one
believes Saddam Hussein when he says Kuwait is eternally going to
be part of Iraq,'' he said.
   Last March the Lithuanian parliament voted to declare
independence from Moscow, which followed by imposing an economic
embargo on Lithuania that lasted about three months.
   The latest dispute erupted in November when the three Baltic
states rejected a Soviet plan that would give Moscow control over
budgetary, financial and tax matters and require that almost all
foreign currency earnings be turned over to the central government.
Landsbergis said the dispute is behind the latest boycott threat.
   ``There is no question that people will suffer'' if another
blockade is enforced, he said, adding he hoped ``assistance from
the West will not be limited to the sending of medicine.''
   Landsbergis also expressed concern about Gorbachev's appointment
earlier this month of former KGB general Boris Pugo to the interior
minister's post.
   He said Pugo, considered a hardliner, represents ``a group of
people for whom the survival of the empire is much more important
than social and economic reforms.''
   Landsbergis said he planned to meet Soviet Prime Minister
Nikolai Ryzhkov in Moscow Thursday. He said he would discuss the
threatened economic blockade, but that his primary purpose would be
to lay the groundwork for stalled negotiations with Moscow on the
republic's eventual independence.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
will meet in Washington with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir,
a move that could enhance relations between the two countries, U.S.
officials said here today.
   Shevardnadze is winding up two days of meetings here with
Secretary of State James A. Baker III. One of the main topics is
the crisis in the Persian Gulf.
   The Soviets have held out the prospect of resuming normal
relations with Israel after a 23-year break. They have exchanged
diplomats but formal ties remain broken since the 1967 Mideast war.
   The session will give Shevardnadze a chance to try to persuade
Shamir to agree, at least in principle, to a Mideast peace
conference. The prime minister objects, arguing that the Soviets
might line up with the Arabs and try to impose unacceptable terms
on Israel.
   Shevardnadze and Baker, changing plans, decided to head back to
Washington Tuesday night instead of Wednesday morning. One reason,
said the U.S. officials who demanded anonymity, was to give
Shevardnadze more time to get to see Shamir, who visited President
Bush today.
   Baker will meet with Shamir Thursday.
   The Bush administration has stood alongside Israel in trying to
forestall a drive by Arab and neutral governments to hold a peace
conference in which the Palestinians' complaints against Israeli
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza could be considered.
   Baker has said a conference would be useful only ``at an
appropriate time'' and ``properly structured.'' He said those
circumstances were not right at this point.
   Also, Baker wants to avoid linking the Israeli-Palestinian
dispute with the U.S.-led drive to force Iraq to leave Kuwait.

   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - David Letterman often torments his ``Late
Night'' guests, but his attitude is completely different toward
sick and handicapped children in his hometown.
   Letterman quietly gave money to Roncalli High School last month
for construction of a wheelchair ramp. His attorney, Ron Elberger
of Indianapolis, asked that the amount not be disclosed.
   ``My understanding is that it came straight out of his pocket,''
said Roncalli Principal Joseph Hollowell. ``His attorney dropped by
and left a check.''
   Individual donations and fund drives raised $45,000 to buy a
wheelchair lift for the multi-level high school. Letterman attended
a different school.
   Letterman also sponsors a summer camp for children with cerebral
palsy.
   ``Mr. Letterman sometimes calls the children, or writes them a
letter. And they're personally written letters, too,'' said Kirby
Gamber of United Cerebral Palsy of Central Indiana.

   DUE WEST, S.C. (AP) - Country singer K.T. Oslin's latest song
appears to be all about a local resident named Cornell Crawford,
but Crawford isn't talking.
   Crawford he does admit that he ``could be the one'' referred to
in Ms. Oslin's song ``I Ain't Never Gonna Love Nobody But Cornell
Crawford.''
   Ms. Oslin said she based the lyrics on words from neatly written
graffiti she found on a restroom wall 15 years ago during a concert
tour stop at Erskine College in this town of 1,200 in western South
Carolina.
   After Ms. Oslin told her story on Arsenio Hall's talk show,
retired Erskine history professor Lowery Ware launched a search and
found Due West resident Cornell Crawford, now in his mid-40s and
happily married with a family.
   Crawford said he had never heard of the note on the wall or the
song until he read a story in his newspaper.

   Jewish servicemen in the U.S.-led
multinational force celebrated the first night of Hanukkah on
Tuesday shielded from the media to avoid offending Saudi Arabia.
   Religion has been a delicate issue for U.S. military forces in
Saudi Arabia, where all religions except Islam are banned.
Chaplains have been renamed morale officers and all religious
services have been conducted in private.
   ``Hannukah will be celebrated in Operation Desert Shield,'' said
Army Col. William Mulvey, head of the U.S. military's Joint
Information Bureau.
   ``Hanukkah services are well organized and we anticipate they
will be well attended by U.S. military personnel. Of course, in the
kingdom of Saudi Arabia, worship services are being held in a
discreet manner,'' he said.
   In addition to Saudi sensitivities, there is concern the Iraqis
could use any pictures of Hanukkah celebrations as propaganda
against Arab nations contributing to the mutinational force
deployed in Saudi Arabia.
   One Jewish soldier at the U.S. Navy's Fleet No. 5 Hospital got
assurances last week that candles would be provided for Hanukkah.
Each night of the eight-day celebration, another candle is lighted
on the menorah.
   Hanukkah commemorates the rededication of the Temple of
Jerusalem by the Macabees after their victory over the Syrians.

   Tehran radio said Hashemi Rafsanjani's comments came in his

   Iran has condemned Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. But it also

   ``Establishing security in the Persian Gulf and attempting to

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Widens 13.9 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's foreign trade deficit, hurt by
higher oil prices and increased military spending from the Persian
Gulf crisis, widened a sharp 13.9 percent in the July-September
quarter, the government said Tuesday.
   The Commerce Department said the $25.6 billion third quarter
deficit was up from a second quarter deficit of $22.5 billion. It
was the largest quarterly imbalance since a $26.7 billion gap in
the final three months of 1989.
   The new report covered the current account, which is considered
the most important yardstick of the country's international
performance because it measures not only trade in merchandise but
also trade in services and investment flows between countries.
   The higher deficit in the July-September quarter was viewed as
especially ominous because an improving trade balance had been the
only bright spot in a lackluster economy this year.
   A rising trade deficit would make the recession many economists
believe has already started even steeper by removing the strength
that export growth has provided to the manufacturing sector over
the past several years.
   ``A lot of people are looking to exports as the key to
moderating the severity of the recession and helping to pull the
country out of the downturn,'' said Howard Lewis, a trade expert at
the National Association of Manufacturers.
   Cynthia Latta, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill, predicted the
trade deficit for this year would hover around $100 billion and
would remain stuck at that level in 1991 as well.
   Before Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait sent oil prices soaring,
some analysts had forecast that the trade deficit for this year
could drop as low as $90 billion, which would have been the
smallest imbalance since 1983.
   For the third quarter, the primary weakness came from a 29
percent jump in the merchandise trade deficit, which rose to $29.75
billion as imports hit an all-time high. More than half of the
increase in imports reflected higher petroleum prices.
   Another factor contributing to the increase in the third quarter
deficit was a rise in direct spending for U.S. military operations
overseas, which climbed to $4.31 billion, a 17 percent increase
reflecting the troop buildup in the Middle East.
   That increase lowered the overall services balance to $5.8
billion in the third quarter.
   In one bright spot in the report, the balance on investment
earnings shifted into a surplus of $2.46 billion, reflecting
improved earnings by Americans on their overseas investments. That
had been in deficit by $1 billion in the second quarter.
   The other component of the current account, unilateral transfer
payments, primarily foreign aid payments and government pension
payments to Americans living overseas, increased the deficit by
$4.11 billion in the third quarter.
   The current account trade deficit is closely watched because it
translates directly into the amount of money America must borrow
from overseas to cover the shortfall between what the United States
exports in goods and services and what it imports.
   A decade ago, America was the largest creditor nation. It ran
surpluses in its current account as the earnings from its overseas
investments were enough to offset perennial deficits in merchandise
trade.
   But as Americans handed over billions of dollars to foreigners
to pay for imported merchandise, the investment cushion eroded and
disappeared altogether in 1985 when the United States became a net
debtor for the first time in 71 years.
   That means foreigners now own more in U.S. assets than Americans
own overseas. At the end of 1989, the country's net debtor position
was put at $663.7 billion and economists believe that figure will
grow by another $100 billion this year.

   The 1990 cotton crop is expected to be almost
15.4 million bales, up 3 percent from prospects a month ago, the
Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   ``Harvest proceeded with little interruption during November,''
the department's Agricultural Statistics Board reported. ``Yields
and grades in the High Plains were good to excellent, and
Louisiana's production is a record high level.''
   The latest forecast, based on Dec. 1 indications, is up 26
percent from last year's cotton output of less than 12.2 million
bales.
   Upland cotton accounted for 15.01 million bales of the Dec. 1
estimate, and American-Pima, or extra-long staple, 395,900 bales,
the report said.
   The indicted 1990 production of upland cotton as of Dec. 1,
included:
   Alabama, 400,000 bales and 383,000 last year.
   Arizona, 800,000 and 649,000.
   Arkansas, 1,100,000 and 851,000.
   California, 2,800,000 and 2,661,000.
   Florida, 46,100 and 29,000 (carried over from previous
forecast.)

   The Treasury Department said Tuesday that
despite progress in Canada and Europe in easing barriers to U.S.
financial institutions, serious obstacles remain in Japan and some
other Asian and Latin American countries.
   ``Progress in reducing barriers abroad is occurring at a varied
pace, but generally not as rapidly as the Treasury would like,''
Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said in a report to Congress on foreign
treatment of U.S. financial institutions.
   The 506-page National Treatment Study describes how U.S. firms
are permitted to operate overseas, particularly whether they are
able to operate on equal grounds with their domestic competitors.
   ``Significant progress has been made in Canada and most European
countries and within the European Community,'' Treasury
Undersecretary David C. Mulford told reporters at a briefing.
   But he said that ``while there's been some progress in Japan, it
has been disappointingly slow and incomplete as of this time and
fundamental problems still remain.
   ``In other Asian countries such as Korea and Taiwan, progress
has been inadequate and serious barriers to U.S. financial firms
exist,'' he continued. ``We are concerned about denials of national
treatment in Latin America.''
   The study describes national treatment as ``equality of
competitive opportunity.' It notes the United States long has been
a strong advocate of the principal and the``free international
movement of goods, services and capital.''

<TEXT>
   The murder trial of Marlon Brando's
son was scheduled for January, although a defense lawyer said key
prosecution witness is confined under a suicide watch in a Tahiti
hospital.
   Christian Brando made a brief court appearance Tuesday and
answered, ``Yes,'' when Superior Court Judge Robert Thomas asked if
he agreed to have his murder trial postponed to Jan. 14. The trial
was first set for Nov. 5.
   A hearing is expected later this month to determine whether
another judge will request for French assistance in returning
Christian Brando's 20-year-old sister from the Polynesian territory
to testify in his trial.
   Defense attorney Robert Shapiro told reporters Tuesday that
Cheyenne Brando, who was with her brother in the hours before he
shot her Tahitian lover, has been placed in isolation.
   The trial date was set after Miss Brando's mother was named as
her guardian.
   ``She is being confined in an isolated unit because another
suicide is contemplated,'' Shapiro said. ``She's a danger to
herself. ... This is a person I couldn't anticipate would be a
competent witness in this or any other proceeding.''
   Prosecutors, however, said they have learned that Miss Brando
was declared ``incapacitated,'' rather than incompetent by the
Tahitian court that appointed her guardian. They indicated this
signals a temporary condition rather than a permanent one.
   Miss Brando's family has said she took a drug overdose and
recovered, but two weeks later hanged herself, only to be saved by
her mother before she died.
   Christian Brando, 32, told police he accidentally shot Dag
Drollet, 26, during a struggle May 16 at the actor's mansion.
   Miss Brando fled to Tahiti a month after Drollet's death and
gave birth to his child. She has refused to return to California to
testify.
   Authorities in Tahiti also have barred her exit, charging her as
an accomplice in Drollet's slaying.
   Miss Brando's version of events has never been clear. She has
given at least five depositions in the United States and Tahiti,
but Shapiro says they have contained conflicting accounts.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Says Arce Gomez Organized Bolivia For Cocaine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Bolivian interior minister organized his
country as a for-profit cocaine haven, federal prosecutors said
Tuesday as they opened their drug trafficking case against Luis
Arce Gomez.
   Attorneys for Arce Gomez countered that he was ``hard on drugs''
and had made powerful enemies for his anti-corruption efforts.
   Arce Gomez, a colonel in the Bolivian army in the early 1980s
and minister of the interior in what was then the country's
military government, was indicted on drug-trafficking charges in
1983.
   Prosecutor Michael P. Sullivan told the jurors that Arce Gomez
and others in Bolivia and the United States conspired in 1980 to
import and distribute cocaine into the United States, with Bolivian
government figures being paid for protecting trafficking.
   Sullivan said testimony would come from Arce Gomez co-defendant
and former lieutenant Herland Echeverria Barrancos, 39, who pleaded
guilty Monday in a plea bargain to one count of conspiracy to
import drugs.
   Echeverria's job was to arrange protection and collect money
from traffickers, prosecutors said.
   Defense attorney Stephen Finta described Arce Gomez, 52, as a
very popular leader dedicated to his country. But Arce Gomez made
enemies when he became interior minister because he fought
corruption after his ``predecessors regarded the ministry as their
own private piggybank,'' Finta said.
   Arce Gomez was also tough on drug traffickers, Finta said, and
advocated the death penalty for them.
   Arce Gomez was extradited to the United States last December on
the 1983 drug-trafficking indictment. But the case was quickly
overshadowed by the invasion of Panama and the arrest of former
Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega.
   Arce Gomez is also charged with human rights violations in
Bolivia, allegedly organizing death squads with the help of Klaus
Barbie, the Nazi ``Butcher of Lyon'' later extradited to France as
a war criminal.
   The first prosecution witness called was Alex Pacheco, a
confessed drug dealer who allegedly plotted with Arce Gomez and
others to bring about the 1980 military coup that overthrew
Bolivia's civilian government.
   Pacheco said his job was to arrange for protection payments from
cocaine traffickers.
   In the indictment, Arce Gomez, Echeverria and 17 others were
accused of accepting as much as $75,000 every two weeks to look the
other way as drug traffickers moved in and out of Bolivia, a prime
source of coca.
   They also allegedly seized cocaine from uncooperative
traffickers, and once took $1.5 million for releasing confiscated
cocaine held in Bolivian government vaults, investigators say.
   Arce Gomez was forced out of the military government in 1981
under U.S. pressure, and fled to Argentina. He left that country
after its military government fell, and was arrested on a ranch at
Santa Cruz, Bolivia. Bolivian authorities immediately flew him to
the United States.

   A hot air balloon floated over downtown
office buildings up to 42 stories tall but then struck a 1,069-foot
broadcast tower, ripped and crashed Tuesday, killing all four
people aboard.
   The bodies of three men and a woman, all experienced pilots,
were found in the balloon's crumpled gondola about 200 yards from
the WBNS television tower, said Highway Patrol Lt. Randy Thatcher.
   People who saw the balloon said they had feared it wasn't high
enough to clear the tower.
   ``I'd been watching it from work when it came over town, and it
looked like it was losing (altitude),'' said firefighter David Roe,
who saw the accident from the fire department's medical training
center about a mile away.
   ``It started climbing at a steep angle and looked like it would
be OK, so I turned around to go back to my job. Then the secretary
screamed, `Oh my God! It hit the tower!' and I saw it was going
down,'' Roe said.
   John Remy, a reporter for radio station WTVN-AM, said he was on
his way to work when he saw the balloon hit the tower.
   ``I was sort of watching this balloon, and I said to myself, `It
looks awful close to the tower,' but that's just my line of
sight,'' he said. ``But then it hit it, popped and just burst into
shreds.''
   The balloon took off shortly after 8 a.m. from a field near
Mohawk Middle School, just southeast of downtown. It went northwest
over downtown buildings up to 42 floors high. It crashed about 20
minutes after takeoff less than three miles from the school.
   WBNS officials said the accident did not disrupt broadcasting.
The station switched to an auxiliary tower while a steeplejack
removed a piece of green balloon fabric that fluttered from the top
of the tower.
   The victims were members of the 75-member Central Ohio Balloon
Club, said club member Robert Nezey of Columbus.
   ``I can't tell you what happened in that balloon. Nobody can. I
do know that these were very experienced, good people in there,''
Nezey said.
   Killed were Doug Shirey, 27, of Circleville; and Scott Meeker,
26; Kathy Nemis, 20, and Eric Ingwersen, 31, all of Columbus.
   Authorities did not know who was at the controls at the time of
the crash.
   Doyne Shirey said his brother was fascinated with flying.
   ``If he had the opportunity, he flew - every chance he got - in
a balloon, helicopter, it didn't matter,'' Shirey said.
   The balloon was owned by the Bogey Inn, a restaurant in Delaware
County north of Columbus.

<HEAD>After Winning Landmark Case, Abused Woman Still Fears For Her

   A Connecticut woman whose assault by her
husband generated a landmark damage award said Tuesday that ``he's
going to find me'' when he is released from prison, perhaps as
early as next year.
   ``I fear most of all that by being in prison this long, it's
only made him more of an animal and more angry,'' Tracey Motuzick
of Torrington, Conn., told the Senate Judiciary Committee while
testifying on behalf of legislation designed to stiffen protections
against domestic violence.
   ``Because of what I've experienced with him, I know he's going
to find me,'' said Motuzick.
   Motuzick, formerly Tracey Thurman, won a $2.6 million judgment
with her then-infant son after claiming in 1985 that Torrington
police violated her rights by failing to protect her from her
estranged husband, Charles.
   She was left partially paralyzed after he stabbed her 13 times
on June 10, 1983, and kicked her in the head. The damage award was
reduced to $1.97 million in negotiations after the police officers
appealed, said her attorney, Burton Weinstein.
   Thurman's attorney said during a parental rights dispute a few
years ago that the defendant had no intention of harming his former
wife after his release.
   The case was the subject of a 1989 television movie called ``A
Cry for Help: The Tracey Thurman Story.'' The original verdict was
heralded as a landmark for battered women by the National
Organization for Women, and was considered by attorneys to be the
first time a federal court allowed a wife to sue police for damages
in a domestic dispute.
   Charles Thurman was sentenced to 15 years in prison for the
assault. But, with time off for good behavior, his release date is
listed as December 1991 by state corrections officials. He may also
face at least several months more for a 1981 probation violation,
officials said.
   Weinstein said in telephone interview Tuesday that ``I'm going
to do my best to build the tightest fence possible, and appropriate
security measures will be taken. We will take every precaution.''
   Motuzick testified on behalf of a bill drafted by Sen. Joseph
Biden, D-Del., which would make it a federal crime to cross state
lines to continue spousal abuse; provide new funding for battered
women shelters; and make ``stay-away'' orders enforceable in states
other than the one where the order originated.
   Her voice quavered when Motuzick told the panel, ``My son and I
will always be affected by what happened to us. But this was
preventable if the police had taken my calls seriously.''
   Motuzick sat at a witness table next to Charlotte Fedders, whose
spousal abuse case was also the subject of a television movie, as
well a book. Herhhusband, John, is the former enforcement chief of
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Fedders said she endured 17 years of black eyes, bruises and a
broken ear drum. ``Domestic violence occurs in all economic,
cultural, racial and religious groups,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, saying drunken driving has
created a national crisis of deaths and injuries, helped launch a
public-service advertising campaign on Tuesday to promote the
message: ``Friends don't let friends drive drunk.''
   Bush told an audience of business, advertising and safety
officials gathered in the Old Executive Office Building that
getting drunken and drugged drivers off the streets and highways is
one of the key goals of his administration.
   ``It is time for the American people to remember that drinking
and driving are a deadly combination,'' the president said.
   The advertising campaign, developed by the Department of
Transportation and The Advertising Council, Inc., includes video
spots of coffins, grave stones, grieving relatives and friends and
features a repeated theme that friends should get involved when
friends have had too much to drink.
   ``Take the keys. Call a cab. Take a stand. Friends don't let
friends drive drunk,'' is the repeated message.
   ``I can't think of a better gift to a friend this holiday
season,'' said Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner.
   Jerry Ralph Curry, head of the Transportation Department's
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said 22,425 people
were killed and 345,000 injured in alcohol-involved crashes last
year.
   ``Every 23 minutes there is an alcohol related traffic fatality
in the United States,'' Skinner said. ``This campaign encourages
all of us to take personal responsibility for stopping these
needless deaths.''
   The campaign, produced for the ad council by the agency of
Wells, Rich, Greene, includes three television announcements, six
radio spots and print and outdoor advertising.
   The announcement of the ad campaign was a part of the annual
observance of the Transportation Department's Drunk and Drugged
Driving Week which is held in advance of the holiday season. This
year it is being observed Dec. 9-15.

   Jenny Langley already has received the
only Christmas present she wants this year.
   On Monday, Ms. Langley moved out of a hospital and into her own
home.
   Left paralyzed and dependent on a ventilator from two accidents,
Ms. Langley, 27, has begun a one-year experiment to test whether a
ventilator-dependent quadriplegic can live outside an institution
successfully and economically.
   ``I'm so happy to be here. It's going to be a great Christmas,''
said Ms. Langley.
   With a $65,000 grant from the Shepherd Spinal Center in Atlanta,
Ms. Langley wants to show state officials they could save money by
providing quadriplegics with independent care at home rather than
paying to keep them in nursing homes or hospitals.
   The Georgia Department of Medical Assistance for the first time
next year will seek funds to allow quadriplegics to live at home
rather than in an institution. Six states - Oregon, Maine,
Illinois, California, Minnesota and Rhode Island - offer funding
for disabled people who choose to live at home, Shepherd officials
said.
   Deputy Commissioner Russell Toal said the medical assistance
department is asking for $584,000 for fiscal year 1992 to begin an
independent care program for 24 quadriplegics for six months.
   ``It's something that's been needed for a long time,'' Toal
said. ``I think we need to give them the opportunity to live on
their own.''
   A 1976 diving accident left Ms. Langley paralyzed from the waist
down at age 14. Ten years later, an auto accident paralyzed her
from the neck down and made her dependent on a ventilator.
   Ms. Langley's parents went broke trying to care for her. Their
Yatesville home was sold on the auction block in July to satisfy an
unpaid bank loan. Ms. Langley was admitted to Shepherd this summer
with respiratory problems, and she was planning to live in a
$675-a-day South Carolina nursing home when she recovered.
   ``We're really excited about this situation for Jenny. It's so
much better than the other placements we've had to do,'' said
Shepherd resource director Leigh VanderEls.
   Ms. Langley has a $125-a-day budget with which she'll pay for
rent, utilities, food and part-time attendants. Sheryl Langley,
Jenny's 33-year-old sister, and her two daughters will live with
Jenny in the three-bedroom, $750-a-month brick house about 30
minutes south of Atlanta.
   ``I don't know what I would do if I had to live in a nursing
home,'' Jenny Langley said. ``People who have their minds don't
deserve to just be put away. They have a right to live.''
   Quadriplegic Larry McAfee, a 34-year-old Atlanta resident who
waged a highly publicized court fight last year to win the right to
shut off his life-sustaining respirator, said he is inspired by Ms.
Langley's move.
   ``Tell her I said good luck. It's fantastic,'' said McAfee, who
remains on a respirator and plans to move in January from an
Atlanta hospital into an Augusta personal-care home with two or
three other quadriplegics.
   McAfee has lived in several hospitals or nursing homes since a
1985 motorcycle accident left him paralyzed from the neck down.
   ``Anytime you can get away from an institutional setting, it's
more stimulating. It allows you the freedom to live,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   From politicians in chartered planes to
peasants on horseback, thousands have converged on this village
deep in the Amazon for a murder trial that some say could shape the
future of the world's largest rain forest.
   Two cattle ranchers accused of killing union leader and renowned
Amazon defender Chico Mendes are expected to go on trial beginning
Wednesday, nearly two years after Mendes was gunned down.
   But already, the village of pastel-colored wood cabins about
2,650 miles miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro is buzzing with
speculation and a sense of fear over the final judgment.
   Local residents, many of whom survive by harvesting rubber and
nuts from the forest, see the trial as symbolizing the battle
between the poor seeking collective use of the rain forest against
landowners, and ranchers who want to cut it down.
   Private and government development efforts in the Amazon region
have intensified since 1980, and estimates on deforestation range
from from about 5 percent to 12 percent. The rain forest, about
twice the size of Alaska, is the only habitat for many of the
world's plant and animal species.
   ``This is a historic trial, not only in Brazil but in the
world,'' said chief prosecution lawyer Marcio Thomaz Bastos. ``In
Brazil, it is a test case of reckless lawlessness. And for the
whole world, it is an indicator of whether or not man will allow
the Amazon to be destroyed.''
   Mendes, a 44-year-old rubber tapper who led a movement to stop
destruction of the rain forest, was killed by a shotgun blast on
Dec. 22, 1988, as he stepped out of the back door of his humble
wood house in Xapuri.
   Rancher Darly Alves da Silva and his 23-year-old son, Darci, are
charged with planning and executing the crime. They were being held
in the Acre state prison in Rio Branco, the capital of this far
western Amazon state.
   The two were to be flown to Xapuri by helicopter under heavy
guard.
   About 2,000 peasants from all over the region are descending on
this town in canoes, mule-drawn carts, on horseback and on foot.
People are setting up tents, hammocks and mattresses in the spare
rooms or porches of relatives or friends.
   Rubber tappers traveled up the Acre River more than 50 miles to
attend the trial.
   ``If Darly and Darci are found not guilty, only God will be able
to save our town in the rain forest,'' said Raimundo da Silva Maia,
a 51-year-old tapper.
   Hundreds of politicians, including some government officials and
many representatives of leftist Workers Party of which Mendes was a
member, began to arrive late Tuesday aboard chartered planes and
buses from Rio Branco, 110 miles away.
   More than 100 state troopers were flown in to prevent violence
between ranchers, residents and rubber tappers. Roadblocks of
heavily armed police were set up along the muddy, rutted road that
connects Xapuri to Rio Branco.
   Judge Adair Longhini said at least a dozen heavily armed
troopers would surround the small wooden courthouse near the main
square.
   But many residents doubted the security measures would be enough
to guarantee a violence-free trial.
   ``We're worried the trial will trigger violence, not stop it,''
said Ilzamar Mendes, the widow of Chico Mendes.
   ``Darly has had messages sent to us saying he would take his
revenge whether he was released or not,'' she said.
   In the meantime, the town is bustling to accommodate the crush
of visitors. Brand-new public telephones are sprouting on street
corners. Sidewalk curbs, park benches and trees trunks are getting
fresh coats of green and white paint.
   Banners are strung over the brick streets reading ``Justice for
All'' and ``Save the Amazon.''
   ``We are waiting to see if justice will finally be served, ''
said Amini de Carvalho Santana 26, a drugstore clerk. ``The forest
and the people who live in it will be destroyed without justice.''

   It's safe enough to ski on but authorities
say it's not a good idea to eat any of the snow from Vail's
snowmaking operations, which use water that is partly from treated
sewage.
   Water intakes for snowmaking in the Rocky Mountains resort 70
miles west of Denver are less than 100 yards downstream from a
sewage plant's outflow into Gore Creek.
   When the creek runs low, regulators let Vail's snowmaking crews
take only the same amount of water from the creek that the sewage
plant is pumping in.
   As a result, state officials say, one-third to two-thirds of
Vail's manmade snow is water from the sewage plant.
   ``Would I eat that snow? Knowing what I know? Probably not,''
said Jay Skinner, a Colorado Division of Wildlife official who
monitors resort snowmaking and its effect on streams. ``I know it
should be treated OK, but I wouldn't drink what's coming out the
effluent pipe, either.''
   ``If it was a problem, you'd think someone in government would
have told us,'' said Joe Macy, Vail's ski mountain planner. ``But
the state accepted this agreement,''
   The Vail sewage plant actually is one of the state's cleanest
because it uses tertiary treatment, the most stringent method,
health officials said.
   But last winter, it still released up to 368 parts per million
of fecal coliform bacteria and up to 1.1 ppm of ammonia, far in
excess of drinking water standards.

   Tyminski, 42, had been ordered to remain in Poland pending

Tuesday night he had obtained permission to return temporarily to
his children and home in Canada after posting a $100,000 bond.
   Tyminski said he would depart Wednesday morning, but he pledged
to return to Poland by Jan. 5.
   ``I would like to see my children,'' Tyminski said. ``And I
would like to rest after the campaign.''
   Jaruzelski, in a farewell speech broadcast on nationwide
television Tuesday night, apologized for ``each harm, pain and
injustice'' during his nine years in power - apparently referring
to his 1981 decision to impose martial law to quash Solidarity and
the years of repression that followed.
   ``The word of `sorry' may sound all too casual,'' Jaruzelski
said. ``But I cannot find another one.''
   He said, however, that he was guided by ``the good of the
country (and) by a will to spare Poland a tragedy and its people
excessive suffering.''
   Jaruzelski as head of the Communist Party was Poland's leader
from October 1981 until July 1989, when he was elected president -
an office whose powers he used only passively. His term will end
when Walesa is sworn in, expected Dec. 21.
   The announcement that Tyminski could leave followed a
three-hour, 25-minute meeting in Warsaw with two prosecutors from
the southern province of Nowy Sacz. Tyminski said he had not
retracted his allegation against the government of ``treason'' and
of betraying the citizens by creating economic chaos.
   ``I do not regret what I said,'' Tyminski said Tuesday, ``and I
am ready to bear all the consequences.''
   He added, ``I cannot change what I said.''
   Prosecutors on Monday ordered the emigre businessman be barred
from leaving the country pending a Dec. 17 hearing.
   Polish law provides for jail terms of six months to eight years
for those who ``demean the top state authorities,'' prosecutors
have said.
   Tyminski said he and his Peruvian-born wife planned to leave
Wednesday morning for the Toronto home where they lived until this
fall, when Tyminski returned to his native Poland and decided to
run for president.
   Tyminski said he would go for three days, to see his children
and to prepare his defense using videotapes of the Nov. 17 speech
that are in Canada.
   Meanwhile Walesa, the election victor, made an emotional
pilgrimage to the 14th-century Jasna Gora monastery in Czestochowa,
135 miles southwest of Warsaw.
   ``Queen of Poland, in this historic moment I stand before you at
the very sources of my faith,'' Walesa said before the Black
Madonna, the jewel- encrusted icon whose image the Solidarity chief
always wears on his lapel.
   ``Assuming ... the office of president of the fair republic of
Poland, conscious of my responsibilities to God, the nation,
history and my conscience,'' he pledged to protect the ``dignity
... sovereignty and security'' of Poland and ``devote myself
entirely to the nation.''
   His homage recalled the sanctuary provided by churches
nationwide to Solidarity activism when the union was banned by the
Communists.
   In Rome, Polish-born Pope John Paul II sent his congratulations
to Walesa, and pleaded for unity during Poland's difficult
post-Communist transition.
   At Solidarity's Gdansk headquarters, the union's national
commission considered the procedure to name a new chairman. An
special nationwide congress was proposed for as early as
mid-January.
   After a campaign that strained Poland's new democracy and
registered discontent with its difficult course toward economic
reform, Walesa received 74.25 percent of the vote Sunday to 25.75
percent for his dark-horse challenger in the presidential runoff
election.
   Walesa, who has already started consulting with advisers on
naming a new prime minister, is to be sworn in for a five-year term
by Parliament.
   Tyminski said on Tuesday that he would not contest the results,
despite allegations Sunday night that supporters had been
intimidated and ``some people had their dogs poisoned.''
   Tyminski, who has Canadian, Peruvian and Polish citizenships,
said he was unsure whether he will found a political party.
   The leader of the fringe Libertarian Party of Canada and owner
of computer businesses, Tyminski portrayed himself as a
rags-to-riches story. But his first-round success was derailed
before Sunday's runoff by questions about his connections with
former Communist operatives and his vagueness of his promises for
quick economic recovery.

   Hartz Mountain Corp. will pay $45,000 to
settle charges that it failed to report pet illnesses and deaths
from a top-selling flea and tick repellent, the Environmental
Protection Agency said Tuesday.
   The pet product giant agreed to pay half the original $90,000 in
penalties, but admitted no liability, according to a statement.
   EPA said the fines stemmed from a 1987 investigation into
complaints from veterinarians and consumers about Blockade sprays
for dogs and cats.
   Agency spokesman Al Heier said the animals were absorbing the
pesticides into their skins and suffered tremors, vomiting and
convulsions. Young kittens and old cats were the most susceptible,
but often recovered if they were bathed, he said.
   The Illinois-based National Animal Poison Information Network
told EPA that by the end of 1987 - the year the product went on the
market - it had reports of 496 incidents, including 75 deaths,
Heier said.
   Harrison, N.J.-based Hartz Mountain placed warnings on its
labels in 1987, then voluntarily removed the product in 1988 to
conduct more extensive testing, Heier said. Blockade was
reintroduced in 1989.
   EPA did not bring its formal 18-count complaint until Jan. 31.
   Hartz spokesman William Pearlberg said the company was ``most
surprised'' at the complaint, believing it had reported all
required information in a timely manner.
   Registered pesticide producers must pass on health complaints to
EPA within a ``reasonable'' period. EPA defined that as a month in
the Blockade case, EPA attorney Scott Garrison said.
   ``We did not consider it to be reporting when we had to send
inspectors out to get it,'' Garrison said.
   Heier said Blockade flea and tick repellents contain a
combination of the pesticides DEET and fenvalerate.
   ``There is some danger in the product,'' Heier said. ``However,
from our information, it shows the risks of using Blockade is no
greater than using any other pet product.''
   According to Heier, the revised label directs consumers not to
use Blockade on cats less than a year old, on pregnant cats or on
puppies younger than 3 months.
   Hartz Mountain maintains the formula is effective in preventing
insect-borne diseases.

<HEAD>Libya Says U.S. Troops Threatened to Kill Libyan POWs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Libya on Tuesday accused the United States
of ``international piracy'' for airlifting hundreds of Libyan
prisoners of war out of Chad.
   U.S. troops evacuated about 600 Libyan POWs held by the former
Chadian government on Friday and Saturday as victorious rebels
consolidated their control of Chad.
   The United States has said the evacuation was part of a
humnitarian gesture with international backing.
   In another development, Libya said Tuesday it has asked Iraq to
hand over some American hostages to be held in exchange for the
former Libyan prisoners of war taken from Chad. The report came
from Libya's official JANA news agency, monitored in Rome.
   But Iraq's information minister has said Iraq will not hand over
any Americans. U.S. and other foreign hostages were freed under a
blanket decree by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and have been
leaving the Iraqi capital on evacuation flights.
   In the evacuation of the POWs, Libya said U.S. troops threatened
to kill any Libyan who refused to go.
   The Libyans were flown to Nigeria, that country's foreign
minister confirmed on Tuesday. Other former POWs returned to Libya,
which helped arm the rebels.
   Libya has accused the United States of training the POWs to
destabilize Col. Moammar Gadhafi's Libyan government, and called
for an emergency meeting of the Security Council to discuss the
matter.
   Yemen currently holds the presidency of the council. Yemeni
Ambassador Abdalla Saleh al-Ashtal said the council may meet on the
request Wednesday.
   Libyan Foreign Minister Ibrahim Bashari said the Libyans were
put on a U.S. Air Force plane ``against their will and against
their wishes, under the protection of the French forces stationed
at N'Djamena,'' Chad's capital.
   In his letter to Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar,
which was released Tuesday, Bashari said the prisoners ``were
forcibly removed, having been threatened, subject to the use of
weapons by United States agents and with the cooperation of the
French forces, that whoever refused to leave would be killed and
his body thrown onto the road.''
   ``This act of international piracy by the United States
constitutes a violation of the sovereignty of an independent
state,'' Bashari said.
   His letter gave no indication of how he learned the alleged
details of the evacuation.
   The U.S. Mission to the United Nations has had no comment on the
Libyan accusations. The French Mission had no immediate comment.
   Chadian forces captured the Libyan fighters in clashes in 1983
and 1987. Chad and Libya have battled on and off in a border
dispute for more than 20 years.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross complained Monday
in Geneva that it was not allowed to supervise the airlift and said
it wanted to interview the prisoners to make sure they left
voluntarily.
   ``The ICRC has not been able to carry out protection work on
their behalf as it would have wished,'' it said in a statement.
   The Red Cross said it was never allowed to visit Libyan
prisoners captured during the long conflict between Chad and Libya,
despite repeated requests to Chad's former government led by
President Hissene Habre.
   Idriss Deby's rebel forces toppled Habre this month. Deby is now
interim president.
   Nigeria's foreign minister, Gen. Ike Nwachukwo, told reporters
Tuesday that the Red Cross had asked his country to take in the
Libyans on humanitarian grounds, ``so we did.''
   He said they were currently outside Lagos, the capital, and were
being readied for transfer to another country, which he would not
identify.

   Actor Burt Lancaster, partially
paralyzed by a stroke two weeks ago, remained hospitalized Tuesday
in an intensive care unit where therapists worked to help him
regain his motor skills.
   The 77-year-old star was visiting a friend when he collapsed
Nov. 30 and was taken by ambulance to Los Alamitos Medical Center
in serious condition. Doctors said the stroke left his right side
partially paralyzed.
   ``He's still in intensive care and he's undergoing extensive
physical therapy and speech therapy. His spirits are high,'' said
his agent Ben Benjamin.
   Doctors had no idea how long Lancaster would be hospitalized,
and nursing supervisor Wendy Beck would only say Lancaster was
stable.
   Lancaster, who starred in more than 70 motion pictures, won an
Academy Award in 1960 for his portrayal of an evangelist in ``Elmer
Gantry.''
   Benjamin said Lancaster's wife has been with the actor
constantly, taking a hospital room nearby.

<HEAD>Report: Westinghouse to Seek Permission to Restart Savannah River
Reactor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The operator of the Savannah River nuclear
arms plant has not decided when to ask federal permission to
restart a reactor, despite a published report the request will be
made this summer, a company spokesman said.
   ``Specific recommendations are far from being finalized,'' said
Jack N. Herrmann, public relations spokesman for the Westinghouse
Savannah River Co.
   The Augusta Chronicle reported Tuesday that Westinghouse said in
a 250-page report to be submitted to the Department of Energy that
it plans to request permission to begin full-power operation for
the K-reactor between June 30 and July 9.
   The newspaper did not report when Westinghouse wants to start
the reactor, but said testing could begin as early as June 3.
   Savannah River Site's three aging reactors are the nation's sole
source of tritium, a key element in the production of nuclear
weapons.
   Tritium, a radioactive gas used to boost the explosive power of
nuclear weapons, decays about 5.5 percent annually, and must be
replenished periodically in warheads.
   The K-Reactor was shut down in the summer of 1988 amid charges
of unsafe practices.
   In May, Energy Secretary James Watkins told a Senate
subcommittee that the K-Reactor would begin operations in late
December or early January and that all three reactors would be up
and running by the end of 1991.
   But Deputy Energy Secretary Henson Moore said last month the
agency didn't know when the reactors would restart. Improved U.S.
relations with the Soviet Union had reduced the need to try to meet
the December restart schedule, Moore said.

<TEXT>
   Armand Hammer's nearly 70 years of contact with
the Soviet Union left an indelible mark on this country, from
memorabilia enshrined in Vladimir Lenin's apartment to a modern
capitalist trade center in Moscow.
   Hammer, 92, who died Monday in Los Angeles, received official
adulation in the Soviet Union while bringing him some scorn in his
native United States for dealing with the nation's former Cold War
enemy.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sent a message of condolence to
the Hammer's family and said he ``was associated with one of the
most remarkable pages'' in U.S.-Soviet relations.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh said the charismatic
entrepreneur will be remembered for his tireless efforts to
maintain good relations with the Kremlin.
   ``It is a big loss,'' said Dr. Matt Shatz, a producer at Armand
Hammer Productions, a Moscow film-making company Hammer founded 12
years ago.
   ``He put all his strength into this company,'' Shatz said.
   Hammer made many trips to the Soviet Union, the first in 1921 as
a 23-year-old doctor just out of Columbia University medical
school. Hammer, the son of a Russian-born father, arrived as the
Soviet Union suffered famine exacerbated by World War I.
   He met Lenin, the Soviet founder, and was enlisted to help
re-establish trade between the Communist government and the West.
Hammer's first deal was U.S. grain for Soviet products.
   Hammer stayed in the country until 1930, becoming an executive
of the Amalgamated American Co., which the state news agency Tass
said was founded with Lenin's personal approval, Tass said.
   During a later visit to the Soviet Union, he said: ``I'll never
forget what Lenin told me during one of our meetings. He said, `Dr.
Hammer, we don't need doctors. We need business people who can do
things.' That was the end of my promising medical career.''
   Hammer, chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corp., became a
representative of 38 foreign companies in the Soviet Union. He
owned and operated an asbestos mine and founded the first pencil
factory in the U.S.S.R.
   Visitors to Lenin's meticulously preserved apartment in the
Kremlin can see four of the pencils standing in a holder on Lenin's
desk.
   Guides also point proudly to a black leather chair where Hammer
sat during his meetings with the revolutionary leader, and to a
small stature of monkey sitting contemplatively on Charles Darwin's
book ``Origin of the Species.'' Hammer had given the sculpture to
Lenin as a gift.
   Hammer met with dictator Josef Stalin, but the two could not
work together and Hammer ended up selling his enterprises to the
Soviet government. After Stalin's death, Hammer resumed his efforts
that melded business and politics.
   ``He will live in history, as well as in people's memories, as
an entrepreneur who made cooperation by his country with the Soviet
Union possible in the years when nobody dared to even think about
it,'' read an unsigned obituary in the government newspaper
Izvestia.
   In 1978, then-Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev awarded Hammer the
Order of Friendship Between Peoples in honor of his 80th birthday
and help in establishing better U.S.-Soviet relations.
   At the same time, Hammer was wrapping up a deal to split the
cost of a huge new international trade center in Moscow. The
center, built for the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games, houses the huge
Mezhdunarodnaya Hotel and SovIncenter exhibition complex. It is
known as the Hammer Center and is one of the city's most modern
office complexes.
   After the Chernobyl nuclear power plant explosion in 1986,
Hammer personally helped bring a bone marrow specialist, Dr. Robert
Gale, to the Soviet Union along with costly medicine and equipment
for operations.
   Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Hammer cultivated his passion
for art and presided over the opening of several exhibits and
galleries. He handed over historical relics, including letters by
Lenin, to the Soviets.

<HEAD>Wheat Stockpiles Still at Record Highs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Global wheat stockpiles continue at record
high levels, putting a damper on U.S. exports and market prices, an
Agriculture Department report showed Tuesday.
   Overall, 1990-91 wheat production forecasts increased from a
month ago, with gains in Canada, China and Mexico more than
offsetting reduced prospects in Brazil, the European Community and
South Africa.
   The projected average U.S. market price was reduced 5 cents a
bushel from November, to a range of $2.50 to $2.70 for the
marketing year that began June 1. In the previous two years, the
farm price of wheat was $3.72 per bushel.
   According to the new supply-and-demand report, exports are still
expected to be 1.075 billion bushels in 1990-91, down from 1.233
billion last year.
   The U.S. wheat stockpile carried over next June 1 into the new
harvest and marketing year was projected at 937 million bushels,
down slightly from the November outlook but still much larger than
the 536 million bushels carried forward last June 1.
   Looking at corn and other coarse grains, the report showed
global production in 1990-91 and the year-ending stockpile to be up
slightly from last month.
   ``Although prolonged dry conditions have cut corn planting in
South Africa ... gains in the EC, Canada and Turkey are more than
offsetting,'' the report said. ``The smaller crop likely will
eliminate corn exports by South Africa during their 1990-91
marketing year.''
   As with wheat, farmers harvested a bumper corn crop this year.
However, unlike wheat, total corn use is expected to exceed output,
meaning some reduction in the stockpile during the 1990-91
marketing year that began on Sept. 1.
   Consequently, corn prices at the farm are projected to average
$2.20 to $2.50 per bushel this season, compared with $2.36 in
1989-90.
   The corn stockpile next Sept. 1 was projected at 1.236 billion
bushels, down from 1.344 billion estimated this Sept. 1.
   World oilseed production, including U.S. soybeans, also is
forecast at a record level in 1990-91, up 2 percent from last year.
   The U.S. soybean carryover next Sept. 1 was projected at 265
million bushels, up 10 million from the November forecast. The
soybean inventory this Sept. 1 was 239 million bushels.
   Farm prices of soybeans were projected to average $5.25 to $6.25
per bushel in 1990-91, down 10 cents on both ends of the range from
November. Last season, soybeans averaged $5.70 per bushel
nationally at the farm.

<HEAD>More Than 500 Americans Will Stay in Iraq and Kuwait</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 500 Americans, a majority of them
children, will remain in Kuwait and Iraq after this week's
evacuation flights, although the number who are doing so
voluntarily is unclear, the State Department said Tuesday.
   Spokesman Richard Boucher said some families with one or more
Americans are staying because they have roots in Iraq or Kuwait. In
other cases, the non-American head of household has been unable to
obtain permission from Iraqi authorities to leave.
   Just how many there are in each category could not be
determined.
   The evacuation of Americans appeared all but over Tuesday, as
only eight boarded a government-chartered Boeing 707 in Baghdad, a
department official said. When the same plane had left Kuwait en
route to Baghdad, there were no Americans aboard.
   With the exception of three Americans who have had visa
problems, Boucher said, all Americans who wish to leave Iraq and
Kuwait apparently have left, so far as is known.
   On the chance that some Americans appear who have not yet made
their presence known to U.S. officials, an additional charter
flight is planned for Thursday. White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said that flight is likely to be the last. There are five
U.S. diplomats working at the embassy in Kuwait and all will be
brought home soon, but it has not yet been decided whether they
will be aboard the Thursday flight.
   The three other Americans who have been left behind had been
among those used by Iraqi authorities as human shields to deter a
potential U.S. military strike, Boucher said.
   He said that as many as 510 Americans will remain in Kuwait and
Iraq permanently. That is more than half the number who were in the
two countries when President Saddam Hussein announced last week
that all foreign hostages were free to go home.
   ``As of today, we believe that as many as 310 Americans have
chosen to stay in Kuwait,'' Boucher said. ``This includes 60 women,
215 children, and 35 males with dual Kuwaiti-American citizenship.
As many as 200 more Americans have chosen to stay in Iraq. Of these
40 are women, 79 are children and 80 are men with dual
Iraqi-American citizenship.
   ``Obviously, the decision to leave is a deeply personal one, but
we have made every effort to offer our best advice as well as the
means to depart,'' he said.
   The embassy has made an effort to ensure that there was not
``the slightest possibility that any American was unwillingly left
behind,'' Boucher said.
   He said U.S. officials have received information about 30
persons said to be Americans living in Kuwait but have had no luck
in locating them.
   ``It is not known whether these individuals are still in Kuwait,
whether they have ever been in Kuwait, whether they are American
citizens, or even whether many of them exist,'' Boucher said.

   Factional rivalries erupted in
warfare Tuesday in Tokoza, where Zulus and Xhosas slashed and shot
37 people to death and burned scores of homes before black
officials held peace talks.
   In the afternoon, when the violence had died down, women piled
household belongings on their heads and fled in the rain to seek
shelter in a nearby township.
   Armed men stayed behind, guarding their shacks in the
impoverished township and the workers' hostels that have become a
flashpoint of factional unrest.
   Representatives of the African National Congress and the Inkatha
Freedom Party, whose supporters are at the center of the clashes,
met later and said they would appeal to their followers to stop
fighting.
   Past appeals from leaders of the rival groups have made little
difference. The death toll in Johannesburg townships has exceeded
1,000 since August, and ANC leader Nelson Mandela and Inkatha
leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi have yet to sit down to talk.
   Buthelezi, citing a tight schedule and late notice, rejected an
invitation to tour Tokoza on Wednesday with Mandela and other black
leaders. He said he instead would visit Tokoza separately with
national Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and said Mandela
declined an invitation to join them.
   Xhosas loyal to the ANC and Zulus who back Inkatha battled for
hours with guns, knives and axes and chased terrified people
through the alleys of the Phola Park squatter camp within Tokoza,
east of Johannesburg.
   Hacked and mutilated bodies lay outside shacks that were reduced
to smoldering piles.
   Fighting also raged in a nearby workers' hostel, where Zulus
live, and in a surrounding industrial area.
   ``We want revenge ... we want to fight,'' some Zulus chanted as
they congregated at the hostel later.
   Both sides blamed each other for the violence and accused
government security forces of helping their opponents. Police in
armored vehicles roamed the township but rarely ventured into the
narrow lanes of shacks making up Phola Park.
   Helicopters hovered above, and the government said police and
army reinforcements would be deployed in Tokoza.
   In the late afternoon, Zulus wearing white headbands and
carrying iron bars stared out from the broken windows of their
hostel or stood guard outside. One woman carried a large saw.
Others held rocks in addition to their bars.
   Down the road in the squatter camp, a few Xhosas were on guard
outside their shacks, draped in blankets in the heavy rain.
   Police spokesman Capt. Eugene Opperman said reports indicated
fighting flared before dawn when Xhosas attacked the Zulu hostel
and the Zulus mounted a revenge attack.
   He denied police took sides in the fighting. He said officers
were fired on several times but were not injured.
   Hostels have been a frequent target of township unrest because
they generally house Zulus who come from the Zulu homeland to take
jobs at mines or in other industry.
   At least 53 people have died in factional battles in Tokoza
since the latest fighting began over the weekend.
   Inkatha and the ANC are South Africa's largest black political
movements. While both oppose apartheid, they disagree strongly on
how best to fight it and on their vision of a future South Africa.
   Inkatha favors a conservative policy, including free enterprise,
while the ANC leans more to leftist economic policies. Inkatha has
opposed sanctions, which the ANC supports, and Inkatha condemned
the ANC's armed struggle against the white-led government.
   ANC National Executive Committee member Penuell Maduna, and
Inkatha Youth League chairman Themba Khoza represented their groups
at the peace meeting Tuesday. They said in a joint statement that
they would try to persuade their members to be more tolerant of
other political groups.
   Buthelezi, the Inkatha leader, released a statement later
deploring the violence but also alleging there was a deliberate
effort to keep him from taking part in the high-profile township
tour Wednesday with Mandela and other black leaders.
   Buthelezi said he received his invitation from the South African
Council of Churches only Monday.
   ``I am very troubled that I am given this kind of overnight
warning of very important matters,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Parliament in the Russian republic on Tuesday told
national leaders not the let the country get caught in a military
confrontation in the Persian Gulf, the state news agency Tass
reported.
   President Mikhail Gorbachev must not let the Soviets be drawn
``into a military conflict in the gulf that could lead to very
grave consequences for global peace and stability,'' the Russian
Congress of People's Deputies said in a resolution.
   The parliament of the vast republic, the country's largest,
recently has claimed the right to make some foreign policy, but it
has no legal power to enforce the resolution over the Kremlin.
   Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze in recent
weeks have shed their cautious tone regarding Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait and indicated support for military action unless
Saddam Hussein's forces don't withdraw.
   The Soviet Union has some ships in waters off Iraq, but has not
deployed any other forces to join the U.S.-led multilateral force
against the Iraqis, a onetime ally of the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Columbia in Good Condition But Plumbing, Lint Woes Need
Investigation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN ANTCZAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Columbia, the oldest space
shuttle, came back from its 10th mission in good condition but with
no quick answers to its lint and plumbing woes, a NASA official
said Tuesday.
   Columbia dropped out of orbit a day early to beat rainy weather
forecast for the Mojave Desert landing site and touched down at
9:54 p.m. Monday, ending its astronomy mission after nine days. On
Tuesday, there was no sign of the rain.
   The origin of lint that fouled cooling systems for two computers
needed investigation, but it likely was inside the devices before
launch and not from the shuttle interior, said Columbia flow
director Bascom Murrah.
   ``The orbiter cooling system looked clean,'' he said. ``These
panels were given to us by the payload community. So if there was
debris in there, we think ... that that probably came with the
panel when it was given to us to install in the orbiter.''
   Shuttle cleaning procedures were reviewed and everything was
``up to snuff,'' Murrah said.
   The lint was suspected to have caused failure of two computer
terminals for controlling the $150 million Astro observatory, a
group of ultraviolet and X-ray telescopes in Columbia's payload
bay.
   Much of the aiming of the telescopes had to be done by the
crew's astronaut astronomers using a joystick and keyboard. Only
135 of 250 planned targets were observed, although that still
amounted to a wealth of data about stars, galaxies, quasars,
supernovas and a comet.
   Ultraviolet and X-ray radiation from such objects is blocked by
the Earth's atmosphere.
   No brake problems were observed when Columbia landed and the
thermal tiles that protect it from the heat of re-entry into the
atmosphere were in good to excellent condition, Murrah said. Damage
to tiles from impacts with debris either during launch, re-entry or
landing was minimal, he said.
   Television pictures of Columbia on the runway showed blotches on
its underside, but Murrah said the shuttle was just showing its
age.
   Columbia ``is an old bird and we've got a lot of pockmarks on it
that we've repaired. But a lot of that you were seeing was old
repairs and not damage from this flight,'' he said.
   There was no immediate answer to the question of why the
shuttle's system for collecting and dumping liquid waste into space
had clogged.
   The clog caused a collection tank to fill up and threatened to
force an early end to the mission. The astronauts, however, became
plumbers and were able to drain the tank into urine collection
bags.
   The system will be examined after the shuttle is flown back to
Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
   ``We had had a problem previously with clogging in that system
and we changed out a line and a dump valve and evidently there's
more debris upstream of those components. But that orifice is very,
very small and it doesn't take much to clog it,'' Murrah said.
   The opening is tiny to compress the stream into a spray so it
will fan out and not freeze solid on the outside of the craft.
   One of the science instruments in the cargo hold, the
Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope, stored its pictures on film. The
film will be removed Friday and sent to Goddard Space Flight Center
in Greenbelt, Md., for processing. The pictures will be ready later
this month or in January.
   Murrah said Columbia should be mounted aboard NASA's Boeing 747
ferry plane in time to begin its return trip Sunday. The flight to
Florida will take two days.

<HEAD>Pfizer Warns Patients About Heart Valves</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pfizer Inc. will conduct an unprecedented
search to warn about 23,000 patients about rare but often fatal
fractures of an implanted heart valve, officials said Tuesday.
   The Food and Drug Administration said it had accepted Pfizer's
plan to locate patients who have the Bjork-Shiley 60-degree
convexo-concave heart valve.
   Valve fractures have occurred in about seven of every 10,000
patients per year, the FDA said.
   The valve was implanted in about 82,000 people worldwide between
1979 and November 1986, when it was removed from the market. About
23,000 of the patients who are still alive are in the United States
and Canada.
   About 295 fractures of the valve were reported to the FDA, with
178 deaths resulting.
   When a valve fractures, a patient's life can be saved if the
valve is replaced quickly.
   ``That's why it is important for C-C valve patients to ask their
doctors how to recognize early signs of valve fracture and what to
do should it occur,'' FDA Deputy Commissioner James Benson said.
   Public Citizen Health Research Group, a Ralph Nader-founded
advocacy group, has been pressing the FDA and Pfizer for years to
notify patients about the danger.
   The FDA's procedure has been for companies recalling medical
devices to contact physicians, who then would speak to their
patients. But that policy is being reviewed, said FDA spokeswoman
Susan Cruzan.
   Also, the agency is developing a plan to work with foreign
governments to notify patients overseas, she said. About 59,000
patients with the valve live outside North America.
   The company last week sent letters to about 19,000 heart
specialists telling them of the program and asking them to contact
patients who have the Shiley valve. About 450 hospitals are also
being contacted.
   On Thursday, the company will announce plans for a patient
registry that will include a toll-free telephone number for
patients to identify themselves.
   The program will be run by Medic Alert, a nonprofit foundation,
which will send letters to patients through their doctors, or
directly if their doctor can't be located, said Pfizer spokesman
Rick Honey.
   Those patients will be sent information about their valve
implant, as well as an identification card and a bracelet or neck
chain identifying them as having a C-C heart valve.
   Medic Alert has set up a telephone number where patients can get
further information. The number is 1-800-245-1492.

   A man who makes execution devices used
around the country appeared in court trial Tuesday on charges of
practicing engineering without a license.
   Outside the courtroom, Fred Leuchter Jr. was also on trial for
his views that the systematic extermination of Jews by gas chamber
during World War II did not occur.
   ``You liar, you liar, I watched my family go to the gas
chamber,'' yelled Anton Segure, a 63-year-old Holocaust survivor
who came from Albany, N.Y., to protest Leuchter's view. ``I was
there. Forty-five years ago my whole family was gassed.''
   Leuchter's case on charges he is not a licensed engineer was
continued until Jan. 22 with no argument.
   He complained that the charges, which include a maximum three
months in jail and $500 fine, have thwarted his lucrative business
as an expert witness about execution technology in capital
punishment trials and consultant on execution machines. Leuchter
acknowledges he is not a state-certified engineer, but asserts it
is not required for his consulting work.
   He has designed and built capital punishment equipment,
primarily electric chairs, for prisons in a number states of where
the death penalty is legal.
   The state filed the charges against Leuchter at the urging of
several of the groups protesting his beliefs.
   And Jewish activists seized the occasion of the hearing to
protest Leuchter's revisionist theories, and they flew in Nazi
hunter Beate Klarsfeld from Paris to join them in this suburb north
of Boston.
   ``He is a very dangerous man. He denies the death of 6 million
people,'' said Klarsfeld, who helped convict former Gestapo chief
Klaus Barbie. ``We are determined not to let him go on with this
denial.''
   Leuchter refused to acknowledge protesters, who also crashed a
news conference he held a few hours after the pre-trial hearing
Tuesday. But when asked several times what he thought of eyewitness
accounts of the mass murders of Jews in concentration camps in the
1940s, he said: ``There are no eyewitnesses. There are none.''
   Leuchter asserts in published reports and interviews that gas
chambers at at least three death camps were not technically
equipped to kill thousands of prisoners.
   Meyer Hack rolled up his coat sleeve to reveal the 73,684
tattooed on his arm in the camp at Birkenau, and said he wished
Leuchter had been with him in 1942 and 1943 when he escaped the
chamber by faking his own death.
   ``I talk with my heart,'' the 73-year-old Hack said trembling
and clutching the woman next to him. ``The brute will never know.''
   But Leuchter, who boasts he is the only true expert on execution
technology in the United States, said the issue is free speech.
   ``Because certain groups and individuals did not like my report,
these groups or individuals have formed an international cabal to
destroy the report,'' he said.
   A Texas lawyer who has addressed the Aryan Nations Congress has
volunteered to take Leuchter's case for free. The attorney, Kirk
Lyons, said they are considering a civil defamation suit.
   Leuchter claims he is a scientist who has disproved the
existence of an event long accepted as part of history.
   ``I'm sure Columbus, Galileo and Copernicus caused emotional
harm to those who promoted the flat-earth theory, but that did not
stop the earth from being a sphere,'' he said.
   Leonard Zakim, executive director of the New England
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, said it would be giving
Leuchter too much credit to engage in an intellectual debate over
the authenticity of the Holocaust.
   ``It's as ridiculous as saying World War II never happened,''
Zakim said. ``Wouldn't it be great if what he said was true?''

   Contradicting a regulator's testimony, Sen.
Alan Cranston's banking aide denied on Tuesday that she pressured
U.S. officials to weaken their hard-nosed enforcement of Charles H.
Keating Jr.'s savings and loan.
   Carolyn D. Jordan told the Senate Ethics Committee that if she
had tried to pressure regulators to go easy on Keating's thrift,
``they would have clearly understood. I did not say that.''
   A senior career regulator testified last week that pressure from
Ms. Jordan caused thrift officials to weaken their enforcement of
Keating's Lincoln Savings and Loan. The official, William K. Black,
said her action was a factor in delaying government seizure of the
Irvine, Calif., S&amp;L and inflating the taxpayer bailout cost.
   Ms. Jordan repeatedly testified she could not recall specifics
of meetings she attended with Keating or his executives.
   At one point an annoyed committee Vice Chairman Warren Rudman,
R-N.H. remarked, ``The witness has very good recall of some things
and very poor recall about some others.''
   Ms. Jordan, counsel to the Senate Banking Committee, said she
called two officials of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board after the
regulators proposed close supervision of Keating's savings and loan
on May 5, 1988.
   She testified that Cranston, D-Calif., one of five senators
under investigation by the Ethics Committee, did not ask her to
make the call. Ms. Jordan said the impetus came from Keating
executive James Grogan, who called her immediately after the bank
board met to complain about its action.
   Ms. Jordan said she found it unusual that the board would take
tough enforcement action when Lincoln officials were disputing
regulators' findings that the thrift was failing. Lincoln was
seized April 14, 1989, and the cost to taxpayers is expected to
exceed $2 billion.
   Last week, Black told the committee that pressure by Ms. Jordan
caused the board to modify its enforcement program several weeks
later and that the changes permitted Lincoln to continue making
risky direct investments and to expand its junk bond business.
Also, the regulator contended Ms. Jordan's call helped delay
government seizure.
   The hearing adjourned for the day after Ms. Jordan completed her
testimony. An executive session is scheduled for Wednesday so the
committee can privately question Grogan.
   The committee, now in its 16th day of hearings, is investigating
the relationship of Cranston and four other senators to Keating:
John McCain, R-Ariz.; Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; John Glenn,
D-Ohio, and Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.
   Keating and associates raised $1.3 million for the campaigns and
causes of the five, all of whom intervened with regulators on
behalf of Lincoln. The committee is trying to decide whether their
assistance was related to the contributions.
   A number of committee documents show that in contacts with
Keating or his executives, Cranston and his chief fund-raiser, Joy
Jacobson, often linked the subjects of contributions and Lincoln's
battle with the bank board.
   Cranston received $850,000 from Keating for three voter
registration projects the senator strongly supported.
   Former bank board chairman M. Danny Wall has testified that
Cranston made an unusual number of calls to him on behalf of
Lincoln, but Wall said he did not believe the calls were improper.
   Ms. Jordan was questioned about a memo she wrote to Cranston on
May 6, 1988, in which she discussed Grogan's account of the bank
board's tough enforcement stance the previous day.
   She said the board wanted a ``supervisory agreement'' that would
trigger public reports on Lincoln's condition.
   ``It can affect the value of Lincoln stock and will depress
prices and affect liquidity,'' Ms. Jordan wrote in the memo to the
senator.
   She then wrote Cranston: ``I told them you were very concerned
that the board would choose the supervisory approach after all that
had come out about the behavior of Ed Gray's people at the FHLBB of
San Francisco, and additionally when Lincoln had over 6 percent net
worth and was not losing any money.''
   Edwin J. Gray is the former chairman of the bank board. Both
Cranston and Keating argued with him over regulators' tough
supervision of Lincoln.
   Ms. Jordan also testified that she, not Cranston, was
responsible for the insertion in the Congressional Record in 1987
of a Cranston statement that was helpful to Keating.
   She said Cranston never approved the statement, an assertion
that produced skepticism from Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., a committee
member.
   Helms said, ``Now what is the story? Did he approve that going
in the record?''
   Jordan responded, ``No, he did not.''
   Helms: ``So just staff members put it in without his

   Jordan: ``That is correct.
   Cranston's statement in the record said he opposed expanding
authority of the bank board to limit risky investments - and was
glad sponsors withdrew such a proposal from pending legislation.
   The statement was cited by Keating in his lawsuit challenging a
rule already approved by the board, which limited risky
investments.
   A week after the statement was placed in the record, Cranston,
DeConcini, McCain and Glenn attended a crucial meeting with Gray.
   Gray testified that at the meeting, DeConcini cited Keating's
legal challenge and asked that the risky investment rule be waived
for Lincoln until the court case was resolved.
   DeConcini has denied such negotiation took place.

   Light rain was scattered over parts of the West on Tuesday, and
the central Plains warmed while temperatures in New England
dropped.
   Scattered light showers developed behind a cold front curving
through the Southwest and extended over parts of California and
Nevada during the morning.
   Snow fell at some higher elevations of California and Nevada,
with up to 4 inches of snow falling in the northern Sierra Nevada
during the night.
   Light showers associated with the same cold front also extended
over parts of Idaho and Montana and eastward into North Dakota.
Freezing rain fell over northwestern North Dakota during the
afternoon.
   Strong southerly wind helped temperatures warm into the 50s
during the afternoon as far north as the central Plains region and
the middle Mississippi Valley. Temperatures were mostly in the 60s
in the southern Plains and the lower Mississippi Valley.
   But afternoon temperatures were only in the 20s across much of
New York state and northern New England.
   Overnight temperatures dipped into the teens in the northern
Plains and the northern Atlantic Coast.
   Tuesday's low for the Lower 48 states was zero at Gunnison,
Colo.
   In Alaska, heavy snow fell over Kodiak Island, with a total of
11 inches of snow during the 24 hours up to 3 a.m. AST Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has received 1,272 metric tons of
food aid from abroad since the start of a campaign to stave off
shortages that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has said threaten his
reforms.
   ``We welcome the hand offered to us and will not push it away,''
presidential spokesman Vitaly Ignatenko said at a briefing Tuesday,
according to the state news agency Tass.
   More shipments were expected Wednesday and they would be
distributed to Byelorussia, the Ukraine and parts of Russia,
Ignatenko said.
   The shortages have grown more acute in recent months,
exacerbated by distribution problems, black market pilfering and
panic buying, officials have said. An Associated Press survey of
major cities across the country indicated shortages were worst in
urban areas.
   The Baltic republic of Estonia, however, apparently was having
few problems. Estonian Prime Minister Edgar Savisaar told Soviet
officials Tuesday by telegram that his republic does not need food
aid from the West, the independent Interfax news agency reported.
   But it would accept medicine for children and the elderly, he
said.
   Estonia, like the other Baltic republics Latvia and Lithuania,
traditionally have been well-off compared to other republics
because of their own food resources and proximity to sympathetic
Scandinavian countries.

   The ousted president of Chad, Hissene

for political asylum.
   A government source said Habre, 48, agreed not to engage in

   Habre aides said last week he hoped to find final refuge in the
United States.
   Reporters watched Habre and his entourage arrive in a small

   A Cameroonian presidential guard who watched the entourage leave
Yaounde said a Chadian military plane accompanied it carrying

   Habre fled into Cameroon from Chad's capital, N'Djamena, on Dec.

   President Bush and Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir put a positive face Tuesday on relations strained by
new U.S. ties to Israel's Arab foes. Bush promised to keep Israel's
``qualitative edge'' in weaponry, an American official said.
   The two leaders, in a ``friendly and good exchange of views'' on
the Persian Gulf crisis and other subjects, also discussed
prospects for increased U.S. aid to ease Israel's immigration
burden, said Assistant Secretary of State John Kelly.
   But Bush voiced U.S. concerns about treatment of Palestinians
living in the Israeli occupied territory, Kelly said, though the
president did not bring up the touchy matter of the slaying of 17
Palestinians by Israeli police during an October riot at a
Jerusalem holy site.
   Nor did Bush press Shamir to cooperate with a planned United
Nations investigation of that incident, because their discussion
``evolved that way,'' without that subject coming up, Kelly said.
   Shamir told reporters he felt assured by Bush that the United
States would not accept a deal with Iraq that would threaten
Israel, especially in light of Israel's increasing edginess over
new U.S. alliances in the region.
   ``I trust the president, what he said. He has said it several
times, and he said it to me now again, that there will not be any
deal at the expense of Israel,'' Shamir said after spending nearly
two hours with Bush and his aides.
   Having promised the United States it will lie low in the Persian
Gulf crisis, Israeli leaders have indicated fear that the
administration would accept a diplomatic solution that would leave
intact Iraq's stores of chemical and biological weapons.
   Israel also is worried about Bush's plans to sell Saudi Arabia
some $20 billion in sophisticated arms and has asked for an
increase in U.S. military aid to offset the unprecedented sale.
   ``The prime minister was assured by the president that we will
maintain a qualitative edge in armaments for Israel, but at the
same time we want to help out with the legitimate self-defense
needs of our Arab friends in the region,'' Kelly told reporters
after the meeting.
   On immigration, Shamir told Bush that Israel ``would be looking
for additional help'' to cope with influx of Jewish immigrants from
the Soviet Union and Ethiopia.
   Shamir did not ask for a specific amount, and Bush was generally
supportive, Kelly said. But he said the administration was waiting
to see the impact of its current loan program, under which the
United States has guaranteed $400 million in loans for new
immigrant housing on condition that the homes not be built in the
occupied territories.
   After the meeting, both Shamir and Kelly stressed the nations'
common opposition to Iraqi aggression in the gulf area.
   ``We have been delighted to express our full support for the
leadership of the president, for the policy of the United States in
this recent crisis of the gulf,'' Shamir said.
   ``And the president also expresses his support for our behavior,
for our policy'' in the crisis, Shamir added.
   Israeli officials had said Shamir would assure Bush Israel would
not launch any pre-emptive strikes against Iraq.
   But when asked about that, Kelly said Shamir didn't talk about
``potential Israeli actions.'' He said Bush thanked him for keeping
a low profile in the crisis.
   ``Israel got praised several times for its position,'' said
Shamir's adviser Avi Pazner. ``There is no willingness on our part
to change that position,'' he told reporters.
   As delicate diplomatic aspects of the gulf crisis proceed,
senior Israeli officials have suggested that Israel might go after
Iraq's military machine if the United States does not.
   ``There was a strong expression of identity of views on seeing
Iraqi aggression rebuffed,'' Kelly told reporters.
   Shamir said that he and Bush reached a ``general understanding,
more or less, on all the moves in the gulf and on Israel's
position.''
   A meeting between Shamir and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze was being arranged for Wednesday in Washington,
Israeli sources said.
   Shevardnadze was traveling to Washington to meet with Bush
following two days of talks with Secretary of State James A. Baker
III in Houston. Israel's cool relationship with the Soviet Union
has begun to thaw somewhat under the policies of Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Kelly said that it was understood by the administration that the
peace process involving Israel and the Palestinians was more or
less on hold until the gulf crisis is resolved.
   Israel is worried that some Arab nations backing Bush in the
gulf crisis will demand U.S. pressure on Israel to relinquish the
occupied lands.
   The administration, while rejecting attempts by Iraq and its
allies to link the two issues in a U.N. Security Council
resolution, hopes to revive stalled Mideast peace moves.
   Previous U.S. efforts focused on getting Israelis to sit down
with Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, but the
Palestinians' fervent support for Iraq in the gulf crisis has made
that even less likely.

   The Pentagon knew that Arab oil money would
help pay for the Persian Gulf operation, but it probably didn't
consider tapping the lemonade market.
   David Petito did.
   The 8-year-old resident of the capital mailed $20 in lemonade
sales receipts - 20 one-dollar bills - to Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney. Delivered with the cash in a wooden box was a note to the
Pentagon chief that said:
   ``Dear Secretary Cheney: Please use this money to help buy water
to help for the troops in the desert and the men on the boats at
the gulf.''
   Cheney's spokesman, Pete Williams, told reporters Tuesday that
David raised the money at a lemonade stand in Washington at the
corner of Nebraska and Connecticut avenues.
   The money will become part of a special federal account set up
by Congress to keep track of private and foreign contributions for
Operation Desert Shield.
   ``It will be added to the account and used as necessary,''
Williams said with a grin.

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S.-chartered Iraqi Airways
jetliner ferrying seven Americans and other former hostages to
freedom arrived in Frankfurt late Tuesday from Baghdad.
   On board the Boeing 707, along with the Americans, were two
Canadians, two Britons, an Irishman, an Italian, and an Australian,
said Craig Springer, U.S. Consulate spokesman in Frankfurt.
   Before departure, diplomats said six Britons were on board and
did not mention an Australian or Italian. There was no immediate
explanation for the discrepancy.
   U.S. officials had originally planned to charter a Boeing 747
jumbo jet to Frankfurt and it was to have two State Department
doctors aboard to deal with people coming out of hiding in Kuwait
who have experienced a lot of stress.
   Just one of the doctors was on the flight, said Springer.
   Springer said the former hostages would stay in a hotel outside
Frankfurt overnight and fly to their final destinations the
following day on regular commercial flights.
   The Boeing 707 was one of three chartered jetliners delivering
former hostages out of Iraq on Tuesday.
   Two others left for Bangkok and London.
   Diplomats said 14 Americans were on the charter flights from
Baghdad.
   Seven were among the 310 people, most of them Britons, on the
flight that left for London.
   Seven more were on the flight to Frankfurt.
   A Japanese-chartered Iraqi Airways 707 left Baghdad for Bangkok
with 159 people aboard, including 14 Japanese diplomats from Kuwait
and the rest mostly former Japanese hostages.
   The White House said Tuesday that a scheduled Thursday
evacuation flight of Americans is ``likely to be the last'' and
will probably also carry home the remaining staff of the U.S.
Embassy in Kuwait.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein last week announced the blanket
release of all Westerners, and the first specially chartered
freedom flights began Sunday.
   Earlier Tuesday, diplomats said about 600 U.S. citizens remain
in Iraq and Kuwait. They also said about 400 were expected to
remain in Iraq, mostly people with dual U.S.-Iraqi citizenship or
American spouses of Iraqi citizens.

<HEAD>Army Demands Tougher Sentences for Stone-Throwers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The army said Tuesday it will press for tougher
sentences for convicted Arab stone-throwers, who have received jail
terms ranging from six months to 10 years in the past.
   Officials said the move was part of a new campaign to quell the
3-year-old Palestinian uprising.
   On Monday, the army began posting snipers at key intersections
in the occupied lands with orders to shoot Arabs pelting Israeli
vehicles. At least four Palestinians have been wounded in ambushes
in the occupied West Bank, the army said.
   In Bethlehem, meanwhile, troops began erecting barbed wire
barriers across some roads leading into the city on Tuesday, but
the area around the site believed to be Christ's birthplace
remained open to visitors.
   On Sunday, a soldier was killed and two others wounded by a
roadside bomb blast. The town's 40,000 Palestinian residents
remained under a curfew.
   A few tourists visited the Church of the Nativity and Christ's
birthplace. Normally, Bethlehem is crowded with Christian pilgrims
during the Christmas season.
   Army prosecutors will ask for harsher sentences for stone
throwers in the military courts in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, an
army official said. But he would not specify what sentences would
be requested.
   ``The policy is to deal with rock throwing in a much firmer
way,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Israel army radio suggested the army hoped to halt rock throwing
at Jewish settlers, who have complained of an increase in stonings
in the past year.
   The maximum sentence for stone-throwing is 20 years, the same as
for manslaughter, but it has never been imposed.
   Until now, sentences have ranged from about six months for first
offenders who didn't cause damage to a year for those who caused
some damage. Sentences of 10 years have been made for those who
injured someone.
   Palestinian lawyer Jonathan Kuttab, who has defended hundreds of
clients against stone-throwing charges, said military court judges
usually follow the requests of prosecutors.
   Kuttab claimed there are different standards of justice between
the military and civilian courts, where Jewish settlers are tried.
   He cited the case of settler leader Moshe Levinger who served
three months in prison after shooting to death a Palestinian shoe
salesman. Levinger was convicted of firing into stores after
soldiers ignored his complaint that his car was stoned.
   ``Because Israel makes the claim that it does have all the
trappings of justice, it must be noted that this is not the case,''
Kuttab said. ``The military courts are part of the mechanism of
control and punishment.''
   The army official rejected Kuttab's charges of unfair treatment
of Palestinians, but acknowledged that sentences in military trials
were imposed for deterrence as well as punishment.
   Army officials have said stone throwing made up about 90 percent
of the violent incidents during the uprising. They estimate 100,000
cases of stone throwing since December 1987.
   During the uprising, Israeli soldiers and civilians have killed
777 Palestinians, while 54 Israelis have been slain by
Palestinians. At least 316 Palestinians have been killed by fellow
Arabs, most as suspected collaborators.

   A Scottish piper played proudly Tuesday as
he and hundreds of other foreigners boarded flights for home after
four months as hostages in Iraq and Kuwait.
   Callum Strachan - dressed in the traditional kilt, tam and
kneesocks of his native Scotland - saluted other hostages by
playing the bagpipes as they cleared Iraqi passport control for
flights home.
   Three chartered jetliners carrying nearly 500 foreigners -
including 243 who flew to Baghdad on Tuesday from Kuwait - left the
Iraqi capital for London, Frankfurt and Bangkok.
   Diplomats said just 14 Americans were on the charter flights
from Baghdad. Most of those leaving were Britons.
   One of the Britons, Ken Emsden, 61, said that four months after
the Iraqi invasion, there was still gunfire every night in Kuwait.
   He said he saw the bodies of four civilians in the street
outside his hideout Tuesday morning.
   ``The people who deserve the greatest admiration are the
Kuwaitis who sheltered us despite the fact that they could be
executed on the spot if they were found helping us,'' Emsden said.
   ``We're just happy it's finally over,'' said Sid Hatcher, 35, of
Knoxville, Tenn., who was held at an industrial site in Iraq.
   The flight to Frankfurt carried just 14 former hostages, while
the plane bound for London had 310 aboard. The Japanese-chartered
plane headed for Bangkok carried 159 people, including 14 Japanese
diplomats from Kuwait.
   (In Frankfurt, Germany, U.S. Consulate spokesman Craig Springer
said seven Americans, two Canadians, two Britons, an Irishman, an
Italian and an Australian comprised the former hostages on the
U.S.-chartered Iraqi Airways Boeing 707 that landed there late
Tuesday from Baghdad. The seven other Americans were on the London
flight, diplomats said, speaking on condition of anonymity.)
   President Saddam Hussein announced on Thursday that Iraq would
allow all foreigners to leave. He had barred many foreigners from
departing, and some were detained at strategic sites to ward off a
possible attack.
   An undisclosed number of Americans chose to stay.
   ``We will continue to provide all services we possibly can to
all Americans left in Iraq and Kuwait,'' a senior U.S. diplomat
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
final evacuation flight for Americans, now scheduled for Thursday,
``is likely to be the last and it is also likely to be the one to
evacuate U.S. Embassy personnel from Kuwait.''
   The U.S. Embassy personnel in Kuwait have defied Iraqi orders to
evacuate, as have British diplomats.
   But on Tuesday, British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd indicated
the two remaining British diplomats might soon leave the occupied
emirate.
   He said in London that once all British hostages have left, ``we
will work out with these two brave men how long they should stay.''

<TEXT>
   Many of the 150,000 Soviet Jewish emigres used
the beginning of Hanukkah on Tuesday to celebrate their new lives
while learning the centuries-old traditions of their faith.
   While the Soviet Jews knew of the eight-day festival of lights,
many of the immigrants are secular Jews and know little of Jewish
history.
   ``Either they are totally confused or talk nonsense because they
have been cut off from Judaism for generations,'' said Alexander
Ilyin, 27, an immigrant who gives religious instructions to
newcomers.
   Other Soviets who immigrated earlier - as well as government
ministries and organizations - have arranged special seminars and
trips to help new immigrants understand the meaning of Hanukkah.
   ``I never knew what Hanukkah or even Judaism was in the Soviet
Union,'' said Binyamin Kletzel, 58, an artist who arrived five days
ago from Kuibyshev on the Volga River. ``The only thing being a Jew
meant to me was that we got beat up.''
   Hanna Yeruslusky, who immigrated from Kuibyshev three years ago,
helped Kletzel look for an apartment before the holiday began at
sundown.
   She said she hoped the joy of Hanukkah would make the immigrants
forget their troubles adjusting to a new country. The many
immigrants have strained Israel's housing and job markets, as well
as the government budget.
   More than 1,000 Jews have been arriving in Israel daily as a
result of the Soviet Union easing its emigration policies.
   Hanukkah marks the victory of the Jews over the Greco-Syrian
kingdom in 165 B.C. The kingdom had tried to impose its culture on
the Jews and desecrated the holy temple in Jerusalem with statues
of Greek gods.
   Jews rose in revolt and drove the Syrians out of the country.
   According to legend, when the Jews entered Jerusalem and tried
to rekindle the Temple's eternal flame, they found only enough oil
for one day. But the oil miraculously lasted eight days.
   To commemorate the miracle, Jews light candles at sunset for
eight consecutive days. The candles are placed in a candelabra
called a menorah.
   The festival is celebrated by religious and secular Jews as a
holiday that not only marks the ancient Jewish victory but also
reminds Israelis of their desire to perpetuate national Jewish
identity.

<DATELINE>MEDELLIN, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   German journalist Hero Buss, who was
abducted by drug traffickers along with six other journalists on
Aug. 30, was freed Tuesday.
   Juan Gomez Martinez, publisher of the daily El Colombiano, said
the erman was left near the newspaper headquarters. The publisher
has been acting as a spokesman for the families of the kidnapped
journalists.
   Buss, a freelance journalist, has lived several years in
Colombia. He called his Colombian wife, who lives in the northern
port of Cartagena, and was quoted as telling her, ``I am here
finishing my stroll.'' Buss had spent 102 days in the custody of
the Medellin cartel.
   The Extraditables, the armed branch of the cartel, released a
statement announcing Buss' release as ``recognition of the fight
for the defense of human rights in Colombia and various Latin
American countries.''
   The statement announced the decision to go along with proposed
legislation that would allow drug traffickers to be tried in
Colombia and ``procedural guarantees'' of safety.
   President Cesar Gaviria took office Aug. 7, 1990, vowing to
remain tough against drug trafficking, but hinting that he might
stop extraditions to the United States and other unspecified moves
to stop the bloody drug war that has killed hundreds of people the
past year.
   Gaviria's predecessor, Virgilio Barco, launched a major
offensive against the traffickers when Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, the
front-running presidential candidate, was assassinated in August
1989 by gunmen employed by Colombia's drug traffickers.
   In the following 12 months, Barco's administration allowed 22
drug suspects to be extradited to the United States, killed
Medellin cartel leader Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, and confiscated
hundreds of properties belonging to the cocaine magnates.
   The traffickers are afraid of extradition to the United States,
where they are unable to indimidate judges. Many traffickers have
been freed by Colombian judges under threat of violence or due to
bribery.
   Buss was the second journalist freed by the traffickers. On Nov.
26, Juan Vitta, editor of the weekly Hoy por Hoy was released.
   Remaining in the hands of the traffickers are Diana Turbay,
publisher of Hoy por Hoy and daughter of former President Julio
Cesar Turbay Ayala; Francisco Santos Calderoon, editor of the
Bogota daily El Tiempo; Azucena Lievano, editor of the a TV news
program and his two cameramen.
   Also held by the Extraditables is Maruja Pachoon, director of
the government's Film Promotion Board and her sister-in-law Beatriz
Villmizar.
   Buss said that he did not see the other kidnap victims, but said
he had been told that the others were fine and would be released
starting Wednesday.

   Gutted trucks and cars were sprawled over
a two-mile stretch of the highway in southeastern Tennessee where
15 people died and more than 50 were injured in a fiery chain
reaction accident Tuesday morning.
   Hours after the smash-up, fireman were still spraying water on
the twisted, burned-out wreckage from the 75-vehicle pileup. Rescue
workers stepped over spilled cargo from trucks as well as scattered
luggage and clothing thrown from cars.
   And the survivors marveled at their own good fortune amid the
carnage that surrounded them.
   Mary Youness, 55, of Cleveland, and her family were next to a
propane tanker truck when the accident began. They heard crashes
all around in the fog, she said, but their car managed to slide
onto the shoulder unscathed.
   ``We feel terribly lucky. This truck was on the other side of
us, and a car was smashed between this truck and another truck,''
Mrs. Youness said.
   ``And the truck driver said that if the car had not been between
them - a girl was killed in the car that was between - if the other
truck had hit him, this explosion of propane would have wiped
everything out,'' she said.
   Officials feared the death toll, the worst since the state began
keeping records 20 years ago, still could mount as rescue workers
searched the remains of some of the vehicles.
   But there were also tales of heroism.
   Bill Johnson, 45, was headed south on Interstate 75 about 9:30
a.m. when his citizens band radio started crackling that there was
trouble ahead on the fog-shrouded highway.
   ``Everybody was hollering on the CB's, `Set it down,''' Johnson
said. ``I stopped because I could see the tail lights of the truck
ahead. But when I stopped, another one hit me in the back.''
   Johnson said he got out of his pickup and rushed to check on the
two people in the vehicle behind him, a four-wheel drive truck. The
driver was shaken up, he said.
   ``I said, `Are you all right?' and he said, `Buddy, I don't
know.' I said, `Will you please just get out of your truck?' He
said, `I don't know,' I said, `Please, get out of your truck,'''
Johnson said.
   Both people got out and Johnson and the driver walked around
back of the four-wheel drive vehicle. Seconds later, a rental truck
rushed out of the fog and crashed into the rear of the second
vehicle, turning it into an unrecognizable heap of metal.
   ``That's how quick it hit,'' Johnson said, shaking his head.
``We got right by that before he hit .... this is the worst thing
I've ever seen.''
   The people, who left with rescue workers before Johnson got
their names, were frightened but unhurt.
   ``They didn't get a scratch,'' Johnson said.

   The publisher of the New York Daily News on
Tuesday claimed progress in regaining circulation lost in a nearly
7-week-old strike and said the tabloid isn't ready to cut losses
and sell.
   Publisher James Hoge met with the board of directors of the
Tribune Co., which owns the Daily News, to discuss the strike as
about 100 pro-union pickets marched outside the landmark Tribune
Tower.
   The strike is costly ``but not as expensive as trying to run the
paper with all the excess costs and contract abuses that we had ...
in the old contract,'' Hoge told a news conference.
   A spokesman for nine striking unions said the Daily News can't
hope to survive without a settlement or sale of the newspaper.
   ``Our rule is that we are plowing ahead as long as we can show
that we are making significant progress,'' Hoge said of putting out
the newspaper under strike conditions. ``It is the opinion of
everyone involved in this process that we are making significant
progress and we are going forward.''
   The newspaper has published every day since the strike began
Oct. 25, but circulation dropped from 1.09 million. Hoge said net
paid circulation was up this week to 580,000 copies from 552,000 a
week ago.
   Hoge attributed the increase to a network of news dealers and
hawkers that now total nearly half the pre-strike number of 12,000
outlets.
   Hoge said he was confident that advertisers who bailed out of
the Daily News would return to the newspaper as circulation
increases.
   The striking unions representing 2,100 workers claim unfair
labor practices. The Daily News has hired replacement workers to
put out the newspaper.
   On Wednesday, negotiations switch for the first time to
Washington before the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.
The two sides were to meet separately with a mediator.
   Theodore Kheel, a legal adviser to the striking unions and their
frequent spokesman, called the decision to keep publishing ``a form
of sheer masochism.''
   ``The News has no hope of survival whatsoever in the absence of
a settlement or sale,'' Kheel said. ``The sooner the board realizes
that, the better everyone, including the Tribune Co., will be.''
   George McDonald, president of the Allied Printing Trades
Council, the umbrella of striking unions, said Tribune Co.
President Charles Brumback was ``hell-bent on a course of financial
bankruptcy.''
   McDonald urged Tribune Co. stockholders to call for Brumback's
immediate resignation.
   About 100 people, most of them from Chicago union locals,
picketed the Tribune Tower, led by several striking Daily News
workers. The demonstration was peaceful.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Cardinal John
O'Connor addressed an estimated 6,500 people at a pro-union rally
Monday in front of the Daily News offices.
   The Tribune Co. also publishes the Chicago Tribune.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Mermaids''</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Film opens Friday, Dec. 14.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   In a season of self-consciously serious films, ``Mermaids'' is a
refreshing breather, a bittersweet reminiscence of one family's
chaotic coming-of-age in the 1960s.
   The holiday treat in ``Mermaids'' is the addition of another
memorable portrait by Cher in the gallery of women she's portrayed
on screen. The entertainer, who once had trouble being accepted as
a serious actress, has matured into a powerful movie presence with
a gift for showing the soft center of tough women without getting
gooey about it.
   In ``Mermaids,'' Cher is Mrs. Flax, a woman on the run from her
own personal demons who takes her two young daughters along for the
ride. She wears tight dresses, tends to bed the wrong men and when
it all falls apart, as it does every few months, she packs up her
girls and hits the road, choosing a new town by poking her finger
at a map.
   For teen-age daughter Charlotte, who narrates this story, these
moves are a recurring nightmare. Although not Catholic, she
retreats into fantasies about being a nun. Charlotte, portrayed by
the ubiquitous Winona Ryder (who seems to be in every movie
requiring a teen-ager this season), fashions a shrine in her room
and sees all events as signs from God.
   Her young half-sister, Kate (Christina Ricci), is obsessed with
competitive swimming and seems unfazed by the upheavals as long as
there's a swimming pool in their new town.
   We meet the fatherless Flax family as mother is breaking up with
another beau and moving on. This time they settle in a picturesque
New England village where the local shoe salesman (Bob Hoskins)
takes a fancy to Mrs. Flax. Charlotte meanwhile becomes smitten
with the young, handsome caretaker at the nearby convent,
challenging her vow to become a nun.
   Relationships develop and careen toward an unexpected crisis
which seems too clearly a filmmaker's technique for bringing the
movie to a conclusion. Suspension of disbelief is essential here.
   Director Richard Benjamin deftly uses the splendid New England
scenery and the '60s backdrop to draw Mrs. Flax's world. The songs
of the era are sprinkled throughout, and a segment recalling the
John F. Kennedy assassination is poignantly evocative of a calamity
seen through the eyes of a teen-ager.
   ``It seemed there were no adults alive anymore,'' Charlotte
muses as she walks the empty, leaf-strewn streets in that autumn of
1963.
   Winona Ryder's earnestness is appealing, and Hoskins, exuding
warmth and normalcy, is the perfect foil for Cher's brassy Mrs.
Flax.
   Some will be reminded of Cher's tough but caring mother in
``Mask.'' But Mrs. Flax is her own woman. Cher knows her well and
insists that we like her. How can we resist?
   ``Mermaids'' is rated PG-13 with a non-explicit sex scene and
discussions of sex but no objectionable language.

   A 16-year-old on Tuesday became the first
defendant convicted of attempted murder in the gang rape of the
Central Park Jogger. A second youth was acquitted of the same
charge and convicted of lesser charges.
   Spectators erupted in anger and shock when the verdicts were
returned against Kevin Richardson and Kharey Wise after 12 days of
jury deliberation.
   Richardson's mother, Grace Cuffey, fainted and the courtroom was
cleared while she was treated with oxygen at her seat.
   ``You're going to pay for this. Jesus is going to get you. You
made this ... up,'' Wise told prosecutor Elizabeth Lederer as he
was led from the courtroom in handcuffs.
   Richardson, 16, was convicted of attempted murder, rape, sodomy,
robbery, assault and riot. Wise, 18, loudly cursed Lederer after he
was acquitted of 10 of 13 counts against him, including attempted
murder, rape and sodomy. He was convicted of first-degree assault,
sexual abuse and riot.
   Three other teen-agers were convicted in August of rape and
assault in the case.
   Richardson and Wise were jailed without bail pending a Jan. 9
sentencing.
   Richardson, charged as a minor, faces a maximum prison term of
five to 10 years. Wise, charged as an adult, could receive nearly
nine to 26 years in prison if the judge orders him to serve the
terms concurrently.
   Wise admitted in a videotapd statement that the April 19, 1989,
attack on a woman investment broker ``was my first rape, and it
will be my last.''
   Wise's lawyer, Colin Moore, argued that police coerced the
statement from his client. Manhattan District Attorney Robert
Morgenthau said he was pleased the jury had rejected that
allegation.
   ``A jury has rejected spurious claims that the police
manufactured evidence and used coercive tactics to obtain
confessions,'' Morgenthau said.
   The woman was not widely identified because she was a sexual
assault victim. Her case generated enormous public interest and
debate.
   Critics of the national media attention attributed it to her
status as a white investment banker in a city where minority crime
victims get less attention. Others cited her dramatic fight for
life, her recovery and return to work, and her quiet bravery.
   The verdicts came in the second trial stemming from the attack
on the woman, now 30, along a jogging path in Central Park. She
still suffers vision, balance and olfactory problems.
   Wise and Richardson wept and hugged each other when the verdicts
were read.
   ``I am obviously shattered, very, very disappointed,'' said
Richardson's attorney, Howard Diller. ``I'm really dismayed the
jury found him guilty on every single count. It's shocking.''
   Moore said ``a fair and just verdict would have been an
acquittal on all counts.''
   Both attorneys said they would appeal.
   Supporters of the defendants yelled at the judge and the
prosecutors.
   The woman, found about four hours after the attack, lost
three-fourths of her blood. Her skull was broken, her left
cheekbone was crushed and she had bruises all over her body.
   Antron McCray, Yusef Salaam, and Raymond Santana, all 16, were
cnnvicted Aug. 18 of rape, assault and other charges in the case.
All were sentenced in September to five to 10 years in prison.
   Steven Lopez, 16, will be the last to face charges during a
trial scheduled for early next year.
   The second trial began much as the first had, with Lederer
saying the defendants' own words would convict them. Defense
lawyers charged videotaped statements were coerced by racist police
looking for black and Hispanic suspects.
   The statements were the prosecution's chief evidence.
   Wise described how the victim screamed, kicked and struggled
violently until she was struck unconscious with a rock.
   Lederer asked Wise whether he thought they had left the woman
dead.
   ``That's the way I looked at it,'' he said.
   Wise later said police hit and tricked him into fabricating the
confession. His attorney charged police and prosecutors with using
``Hitlerian tactics.''
   Diller compared the ``hue and cry'' in the case to that of the
arrest and conviction of Bruno Hauptmann in the 1932 kidnap-murder
of aviator Charles Lindbergh's infant son.
   Lederer insisted the case was ``not about race. It's about
violence. It's about right and wrong.''
   Juror Victoria Bryers said Wise was convicted of first-degree
assault because the jury felt he showed depraved indifference to
the jogger's plight.
   ``He was at the scene and left her to die,'' said Bryers, the
mother of three children.

<TEXT>
   Federal authorities unsealed a 42-count
indictment Tuesday charging six men with operating a $21 million
investment and insurance scam that left more than 1,300 families
with no health insurance coverage.
   The grand jury indictment resulted from a two-year investigation
by the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service and inspectors from the
U.S. Postal Service and the Department of Labor.
   ``What is especially frightening is that we all can be
victimized by this type of criminal enterprise because each of us
has a very fundamental need for a health insurance policy that will
assure us and our families that we can afford the health care we
may need,'' said Julian De La Rosa, inspector general with the
Labor Department.
   He spoke at a news conference at the federal courthouse in
Charlotte.
   ``There are more than 1,350 victims that have been identified in
this one investigation,'' De La Rosa said. ``But the tragedy is not
confined to these 1,350 unfortunate people.''
   The indictment describes allegations of fraud by the now-defunct
Cap Staffing of Charlotte, a firm which leased employees to more
than 120 firms. The company was to use fees paid by the firms to
provide health insurance and other benefits to the workers.
   But the indictment said the company's managers used the funds
for themselves.
   The companies that used Cap Staffing are in North Carolina,
South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania and
Illinois, the indictment said.
   The issue of such health insurance scams was the subject of a
hearing last spring in the U.S. Senate, and De La Rosa said his
office is investigating about three dzen similar schemes.
   ``The victims number in the tens of thousands with unpaid
medical claims totaling in the tens of millions of dollars,'' he
said.
   Six men were arrested Tuesday: Robert W. Long, Victor S.
Blackwell and Jerry M. Wolicki, of Charlotte; David R. Harris, of
Greenville, S.C.; Michael A. Krebser, of Stuart, Fla.; and Michael
H. Spieles, of Palm City, Fla.
   In an accompanying civil action, officials also seized seven
homes, 26 vehicles and business and personal bank accounts from the
men. The property was worth $3 million, officials said.
   Long and Blackwell made short court appearances Tuesday morning,
where they were released on bond, said U.S. Attorney Tom Ashcraft.
   Ashcraft said the seized assets would be used to help the
victims of the scam, but ``it would be a mistake to think there is
a big pot of gold out there.''
   De La Rosa said the biggest tragedy was that many of the victims
were left uninsurable.
   ``This has had a catastrophic effect on many of these people who
have been refused expensive and medically necessary care because
they lack health insurance and they may never be able to obtain it
for any pre-existing conditions,'' De La Rosa said.
   The charges listed in the indictment include mail fraud, money
laundering, embezzlement and conspiracy.

<TEXT>
   U.S. soldiers in Saudi Arabia finally have
chocolate bars that melt in their mouths, not in the sand.
   At the request of the Army, Hershey Foods Corp. sent 144,000
``Hershey's Desert Bars'' that won't melt in 100 degree-plus heat.
   The first round of heat-resistant chocolate sent to the Persian
Gulf was a test of the product, said Hershey spokeswoman Bonnie
Glass. If the chocolate bars taste good and are tough enough for
desert warfare, Hershey will send thousands more, she said.
   ``Chocolate has long been an American favorite and we are happy
that we can supply the soldiers in Saudi Arabia with a familiar
taste from home,'' said Richard A. Zimmerman, Hershey's chairman
and chief executive officer.
   Ms. Glass said Hershey has cooperated with the Army since 1937
in providing specially made chocolate bars. In June 1937, Hershey
sent 90,000 candy bars to military personnel.
   ``There have been heat-resistant bars in the past, but one of
the specifications given out by the Army is that it tastes good,
like commercially available chocolate,'' she said.
   ``Another specification is that it is made with real milk
chocolate,'' Ms. Glass said.
   Ms. Glass would not answer any other questions on the bar's
contents or how it is made.
   The troops haven't sent word yet on the Desert Bar, but an Army
spokesman said the chocolate candy is good.
   ``It's quite a tasty bar. A familiar chocolate candy bar and
it's in a familiar form,'' said Harvey Keene, spokesman for U.S.
Army Nattick Research, Development and Engineering Center in
Nattick, Mass.
   The development of candy for military use isn't unprecedented.
M&amp;M's, a product of Mars Inc., first were made for military
personnel during World War II. What made M&amp;M's so useful to the
military is as simple to explain as the product slogan: ``Melts in
your mouth, not in your hands.''

   The ruling Communist Party in Albania,
the last country practicing Stalinism in Europe, on Tuesday decided
to allow the formation of other political parties, the state news
agency ATA said.
   The surprise announcement in the country of 3.1 million
residents was made in a communique released after a meeting of the
party's policy-setting Central Committee in the capital of Tirana.
   ``The plenum was of the opinion that the creation of independent
political organizations according to the law in force is to the
good of the further democratization of the life of the country and
pluralism,'' the ATA report said.
   The Balkan nation, which opened its borders slightly this year
after decades of isolationism under the late Enver Hoxha, would be
the last country in Europe to introduce a multiparty system.
   Albania broke relations with the Soviet Union in 1961 over
Hoxha's Stalinist and pro-Chinese policies. Sixteen years later,
Albania severed ties with the Chinese.
   Albania has scheduled elections for Feb. 10. They are seen as a
test of the government's willingness to live up to pledges of
gradual reform and of the people's ability to exercise a measure of
political freedom after decades of authoritarian rule.
   But it was not immediately clear if there will be enough time
for new political parties to form and compete in the elections.
   The Central Committee meeting was held following student unrest
that started this weekend and continued Tuesday with a protest of
between 2,000 and 3,000 students.
   ATA said the Central Committee also fired five full members and
two candidate members of the Politburo and called on Premier Adil
Carcani to make ``the necessary changes'' in his government.
   Yugoslav and other observers believed the Politburo reshuffle
and the call for the creation of independent parties amounted to a
defeat of the hardliners led by Nexhmie Hoxha, 69, widow of Hoxha,
who died five years ago.
   It scheduled an party congress for June 1991 and a national
party meeting on Dec. 26 ``to define the electoral platform of the
party and endorse the list of its candidates for deputies to the
People's Assembly.''
   Earlier Tuesday, students demanded Communist authorities provide
more heat and light for their dormitories.
   President Ramiz Alia has conceded Albania's economy was ``on the
brink of a state of emergency.'' A severe drought has curbed power
supplies. Most of Albania's power comes from hydroelectric plants.
   The students gathered outside their rooms in Tirana and stayed
away from classes on Tirana University's campus on the edge of the
city, diplomats in Tirana said.
   The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said police
were out in force, apparently to keep the students away from the
public. No violence or arrests were reported.
   On Sunday, several students were hurt and detained in clashes
with club-wielding police, diplomats said.
   ATA, monitored in Vienna, took the unusual step of reporting
unrest on Sunday and Monday.
   Alia met with student representatives late Tuesday and urged
them to return to classes or else ``incidents which nobody desires
could occur.''
   According to radio Tirana monitored in London, Alia told the
students that top national leaders had followed the protests ``and
from the beginning had expressed themselves in favor of dialogue.''
   The students told Alia their idea of creating an independent
political organization of students and young intellectuals, and
Alia said they could submit their demand for registration to the
ministry of justice.
   The government acted relatively swiftly to defuse a political
crisis in July, when thousands of Albanians streamed into foreign
embassies in Tirana, taking refuge until being allowed to emigrate.
   Since then, the Communist leadership, which has tinkered with
economic and political reform following Eastern Europe's 1989
revolutions, has come under further pressure with the defection of
Ismail Kadare, the country's greatest writer. He fled in October,
saying his hopes that Alia could become Albania's Mikhail Gorbachev
had been dashed.

   The Soviet Union's top diplomat will meet here
on Wednesday with the leader of the Angolan rebel group which has
been fighting the Soviet-backed government for more than 15 years.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze told a news
conference in Houston, where he was winding up discussions with
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, that he has agreed to meet
with Jonas Savimbi, whose UNITA rebels have been fighting the
leftist government in Luanda since shortly after it seized power.
   It is the first meeting between Shevardnadze and Savimbi.
   At the same time, the State Department announced that Angolan
Foreign Minister Pedro de Castro van Dunem will meet separately
with Baker on Wednesday. Baker met with Angolan President Jose
Eduardo dos Santos last March in Namibia.
   The United States and the Soviet Union have been supporting
rival factions in Angola's civil war but lately have been
encouraging the two sides to reach a negotiated settlement.
   ``We are trying to do what we can to help bring the parties
closer together so the next round of negotiations set for January
in Lisbon will be successful,'' a State Department official said.
   ``This is a major development that demonstrates continued
Soviet-American efforts to cooperate on these issues,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The official said the Savimbi-Shevardnadze meeting was ``95 per
cent nailed'' down before Baker opened talks with the Soviet
diplomat on Monday in Houston.
   Savimbi spent part of the day in Washington conferring with
State Department officials.
   In Lisbon, an Angolan government spokesman said the foreign
minister or other Angolan officials would not see Savimbi in
Washington.
   A joint statement of Baker and Shevardnadze issued late in the
day Tuesday said the meetings will discuss such issues as a
cease-fire, free participation of UNITA and other parties in
Angola's political process and the convening of free elections with
monitoring by neutral observers.
   Also on the agenda will be the termination of deliveries of all
lethal material to Angola after agreement on a cease-fire.
   According to official U.S. estimates, the Soviet Union has
continued to send hundreds of millions of dollars worth of weapons
into Angola. Last fall, Congress approved legislation that would
halt the $60 million a year aid to the Angolan rebels if the
Angolan government agrees to a free election and the Soviets halt
arms deliveries to government forces.
   Angola was a Portuguese colony until 1974, when the withdrawal
of the colonial government set off a scramble for power won by a
Marxist group.
   During the following years of the Cold War, Angola was a
divisive issue for the superpowers, and according to Angolan
government figures, 350,000 people lost their lives in the
fighting.
   Cuba first sent troops to support Angola's Marxist government in
1975, and not long thereafter Congress forbade U.S. support for
government opponents. During the Reagan administration, Congress
lifted the prohibition and covert U.S. aid to UNITA began in 1986.
   In December 1988, President Fidel Castro agreed to a phased
withdrawal of his forces, a process that is scheduled to end next
July. The agreement was brokered by the United States and received
strong encouragement from the Soviets.
   But progress toward a settlement in Angola has been halting. A
cease-fire agreed to last year broke down quickly and government
forces launched an offsensive a year ago against UNITA.
   On the plus side, the Angola's ruling party agreed this past
weekend to open the way to a multi-party system, which has long
been a key Savimbi demand.

   The last convict sought by police after
a daring helicopter prison breakout in southern France has been
captured in Algeria, police announced Tuesday.
   Hamid Mazouz, 37, an Algerian serving a life sentence in France
for a string of armed robberies, was taken into custody by Algerian
authorities at the end of November, Bordeaux police said.
   Mazouz and three French convicts escaped from the high-security
Lannemezan prison near the Spanish border Nov. 5 in a private
helicopter hijacked by a friend.
   They ordered the captive pilot to fly across the border, where
they abandoned him and the helicopter and attempted to go into
hiding.
   The three French convicts - all killers serving life terms -
were recaptured after gunbattles with police in Zaragoza and
Huesca. But Mazouz escaped and remained at large despite efforts by
Spanish police to track him down.
   Bordeaux police said Monday that Mazouz was arrested while
trying to enter Algeria, where he is wanted on charges of voluntary
homicide.
   The details of his arrest were not immediately available. It was
unclear whether Algerian authorities would extradite him to France
or try him on the homicide charges.

   Nearly 500 more foreigners flew out of Iraq and occupied Kuwait
on Tuesday, ending four months' captivity following the Iraqi
invasion of the oil-rich emirate.
   One freed British hostage said he saw bodies on the street
outside his Kuwait hideout Tuesday morning.
   Three chartered flights brought 243 foreigners from Kuwait to
Baghdad to join hundreds of other hostages on three chartered
jetliners that left Iraq for Bangkok, London and Frankfurt.
   Callum Strachan, dressed in a traditional kilt from his native
Scotland, saluted the other hostages by playing his bagpipes as the
foreigners cleared Iraqi passport control.
   ``The people who deserve the greatest admiration are the
Kuwaitis who sheltered us despite the fact that they could be
executed on the spot if they were found helping us,'' said
61-year-old Briton Ken Emsden.
   He said there still was gunfire every night in Kuwait and that
he saw the bodies of four civilians in the street Tuesday morning.
   ``We're just happy it's finally over,'' said Sid Hatcher, 35, of
Knoxville, Tenn., who was held at an industrial site in Iraq.
   Diplomats said just 14 Americans were on the flights from
Baghdad - seven headed to Frankfurt and seven to London. There were
no Americans on the flight from Kuwait to Baghdad.
   ``We must have gotten them all,'' said one American consular
official, referring to earlier evacuation flights from the Persian
Gulf emirate. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In Washington, the Bush administration said a planned evacuation
flight Thursday is ``likely to be the last'' for Americans and will
probably also carry home the remaining staff of the U.S. Embassy in
Kuwait.
   ``We would anticipate that once all Americans who want out have
been able to get out that we would remove the entire staff of the
embassy,'' said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   In Frankfurt, Germany, U.S. Consulate spokesman Craig Springer
said seven Americans, two Canadians, two Britons, an Irishman, an
Italian and an Australian were on the U.S.-chartered Iraqi Airways
Boeing 707 that landed there late Tuesday from Baghdad.
   Before departure, diplomats said six Britons were aboard and did
not mention an Australian or Italian. The discrepancy was not
explained immediately.
   Springer said the former hostages would stay overnight and fly
to their final destinations Wednesday on regular commercial
flights.
   The flight to London carried about 310 people, nearly all of
them Britons but including seven Americans. They arrived late
Tuesday at Gatwick airport outside London.
   A Japanese-chartered jetliner left Baghdad for Bangkok with 159
people aboard, including 14 Japanese diplomats from Kuwait. Nearly
all the others were former Japanese hostages.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said in Washington
that more than 500 Americans, most of them children, are remaining
in Kuwait and Iraq - some because of roots there; in other cases,
because the non-American head of household could not get Iraqi
permission to leave.
   Boucher said that except for three Americans with visa problems,
all Americans wanting to leave apparently have left, so far as is
known.
   After his troops seized Kuwait on Aug. 2, Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein barred many foreigners from leaving and detained some
foreigners at strategic sites to ward off a possible attack. Last
week, Saddam said all foreigners who wanted to leave could do so.
   The United Nations has authorized the use of force to liberate
Kuwait unless Iraq withdraws by Jan. 15. By that date, the U.S.-led
multinational force assembled in the gulf and Saudi Arabia after
the invasion will include more than 500,000 troops - about the same
size as the Iraqi force in and around Kuwait.
   In other developments Tuesday:
   -Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said he and President
Bush have smoothed relations between their two countries. ``We have
reached general understanding, more or less, on all the moves in
the gulf and on Israel's position,'' Shamir told reporters after
meeting with Bush in Washington. He did not provide details.
   -Libya's official news agency, JANA, said Libya has asked Iraq
to hand over some American hostages to Libya. The agency said Libya
wants to exchange the Americans for former Libyan prisoners of war
who were taken from Chad. The report did not give any numbers.
   -France said it will send nearly 4,000 more soldiers to Saudi
Arabia by Jan. 15, boosting its deployment there to about 10,000.
   -The first of 170 Czechoslovak chemical decontamination experts
left for Saudi Arabia. Czechoslovakia's CTK news agency said all
the volunteers will be in the gulf region by week's end.
   -The Commerce Department reported that higher prices for
imported oil and spending for overseas military operations helped
boost the deficit in the broadest measure of foreign trade to
$25.59 billion in the third quarter, up 13.9 percent.

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four-year-old Falah Saah, too weak from
starvation to cry out, could only murmur listlessly as he lay in
his mother's lap.
   ``I want drink, drink, drink,'' he said softly, nearly drowned
out by the moans from other sick children in the ward at Island
Hospital, one of only two hospitals still operating in Monrovia,
the capital of war-wrecked Liberia.
   His mother, Maita Solui, said he is one of only three of her
seven children to survive the West African country's yearlong civil
war.
   Hundreds of children have died of starvation, and doctors say
that unless a huge food aid program is launched, thousands more
will succumb.
   Other youngsters, brutalized by seeing mothers raped and
fathers, brothers and sisters killed, became child soldiers in the
rebel armies. Falah's eldest brother joined up, and was killed.
   The physical and mental condition of the surviving children has
raised fears about the future generation of this West African
nation. Relief workers say the degree of starvation has been so
great that many children who live will suffer brain damage.
   The child soldiers suffer in other ways. At the rebel base in
Caldwell, outside the capital, a young boy played with a
remote-control toy car. Draped over his shoulder was a machine gun
- a real one.
   ``I'm a man, I have killed like a man,'' boasted another little
boy. He looked 6 or 7 years old, with a gun nearly as tall as he
was, but refused to give his age.
   For orphans who have watched their parents killed by Liberian
troops, the rebel camp offered a substitute family, food - and an
opportunity for revenge.
   ``They are still little children, but how are we going to
convince them of that when it's all over?'' said Myrtle Gibson, a
real estate agent who turned to relief work. ``How are we going to
make them real people again?
   ``After this war, we're going to have a lot more wars to
fight.''
   Hunger is the most immediate problem. Starving Monrovians ate
the city's pet dogs and cats months ago. They ate zoo animals,
including chimpanzees. Then they turned to the vegetation, eating
weeds and slashing down palm trees to eat the filling but
non-nutritious fiber under the bark.
   A little food is on sale - bunches of green leaves and weeds,
some stolen tinned goods, a few oranges, looted rice. But few can
afford it.
   The Belgian branch of the international aid group Doctors
Without Borders started supplementary feeding now reaching 3,000
children with help from newly arrived United Nations workers.
   U.N. representative Michael Heyn said the relief workers hoped
to soon feed 25,000 children. But he said 90,000 children in
Monrovia alone need a special diet to recover.
   ``The world community has focused mainly on the political and
military aspects of the crisis, but does not realize yet that the
Liberian people are literally starving and dying, particularly the
children,'' he said.
   Island Hospital has become a center for orphans of the war,
children who have lost their parents in panicked rushes away from
the fighting. Then there are the wounded, like a little girl whose
leg had to be amputated, a boy who lost an eye.
   Ellen James, a nurse at the hospital, goes out on the streets
with other health workers to bring in starving children, but they
can only help a few.
   ``We pick up 10, maybe 12; meanwhile they are dying in their
hundreds,'' she said.
   ``It is difficult to find a child who is not suffering from
severe malnutrition,'' said Dr. Richard Ndamse, one of six
volunteers working at the hospital for a token payment of six cups
of rice a month.
   The hospital has no running water and little electricity. A
generator was turned on only for emergency operations because of a
fuel shortage. Monrovia has been without running water, electricity
and regular food supplies for six months.
   The victims in the war have been mostly civilians. It is not
known how many have died - certainly more than the 10,000 killed in
the fighting that began last Dec. 23.
   Monrovia was once a city of about 425,000 people, about
one-quarter of whom remain. According to the United Nations, more
than 750,000 Liberians have fled to neighboring countries.
   The war began a rebellion against the corrupt and oppressive
government of the late President Samuel Doe and turned into a
tribal conflict with three warring armies.
   They agreed to a cease-fire on Nov. 28, but an interim
government and other provisions still remain to be negotiated.

<HEAD>Georgians Outlaw Separatists, Kirgizia Elects New Speaker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Georgian legislature Tuesday abolished the
autonomy of a separatist minority in the southern republic, news
reports said. The vote could set up a new confrontation in the
region.
   Also Tuesday, the Kirgiz legislature elected a new speaker
during a session expected to take up a sovereignty declaration. The
Central Asian republic is the only one of 15 republics that has not
declared some form of autonomy or sovereignty.
   The law by the recently elected Georgian Supreme Soviet
legislature would end 68 years of autonomy for Ossetia, a small
enclave in the northern part of the republic that has demanded
greater self-rule.
   Ossetia is one of 20 autonomous areas in the Soviet Union which
have limited jurisdiction over their affairs. A handful have
declared themselves full republics. Like other ethnic groups, they
fear rising nationalism by republic leaders.
   Ossetians last week elected their own legislature, but ethnic
Georgians living in the region boycotted the vote, according to the
independent news agency Interfax.
   The state news agency Tass quoted ``observers'' as saying Soviet
Interior Ministry troops would be necessary if the Georgian
parliament imposes a curfew and a state of emergency in Ossentia.
   Soviet troops have been deployed in Georgia and other republics
following ethnic tension, although some hard-liners have demanded
more soldiers to stop all secessionist drives.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev replaced his moderate interior
minister, Vadim Bakatin, last week with former Latvian KGB chief
Boris Pugo. Hard-liners welcomed the appointment and predicted a
crackdown to stop fragmentation of the union.
   Tuesday in Kirgizia, the legislature elected Medetkan
Shermikulov, 51, as speaker of their chamber, Tass said. He will
replace Absamat Masaliev, who resigned Monday to concentrate on his
duties as Kirgiz Communist Party chief.
   The Kirgiz legislature also planned to consider resolutions on
republic sovereignty and its stance on Gorbachev's proposed
national Union Treaty.
   Tass did not say whether the legislature took the measures.

<HEAD>Canada Unveils $3 Billion `Green Plan' to Safeguard Environment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government unveiled its $3 billion ``green
plan'' on Tuesday, promising to create five new national parks by
1996 and to set aside 12 percent of Canadian territory to safeguard
wildlife and ecosystems.
   Environment Minister Robert de Cotret's plan includes more than
100 measures to protect Canada's land, water, soil, forests and
wildlife over the next five years.
   ``Three billion dollars is a lot of money,'' de Cotret said at a
news conference. ``That's three thousand million dollars. It's all
fresh, new money. The only thing recycled in the green plan is the
paper it's written on.''
   However, opposition spokesmen and environmentalists criticized
the plan, calling it vague and lacking emphasis on enforcement of
pollution regulations.
   ``This document will do nothing to help the Canadian
ecosystem,'' said Dan McDermott, a spokesman for Greenpeace. ``It
is neither green nor a plan.''
   The plan includes a commitment to put aside one-eighth of
Canadian territory as ``protected space'' for wildlife and
ecosystems - almost double the existing 6.9 percent.
   However, that goal will require the cooperation of the
provinces, and some have already indicated they don't support it,
said Lee Clark, parliamentary secretary to de Cotret.
   The green plan promises the virtual elimination of toxic
pollution and reduction of emissions that cause ground-level ozone,
the major ingredient in urban smog.
   It sets aside $100 million for an environmental initiative in
the Arctic, but offers few details on the strategy. The plan also
sets a goal of cutting Canada's garbage production in half by 2000.
   It promises new legislation on the safety of drinking water,
protection of wild animals and plants, promotion of energy
efficiency, and dumping of waste in the oceans.
   The plan promises to establish at least five new national parks
within six years.

   Candles, towboat lights and truck horns
briefly united residents of dozens of Midwest cities along the Ohio
and Mississippi rivers Tuesday night in a tribute to soldiers in
Operation Desert Shield.
   Residents in at least 47 cities in six states, most of them
small towns along the Ohio River, took part in the candlelight
ceremonies at 6:45 p.m., said organizer Marvin Peter of Evansville.
   ``My son is over there and the only way I can help him is to
show people I am patriotic and support him doing his duty, whatever
it is,'' said Lee Wright, who held a candle in a gathering of more
than 1,000 people at Evansville's riverfront.
   Some of the ceremonies were sponsored by chambers of commerce
and others were organized by support groups for soldiers' families.
The tribute lasted about a half an hour.
   Vietnam veteran Russell Abrams was one of several hundred people
who heard the National Anthem and watched as candles were lit in
Owensboro, Ky.
   Abrams said he wished a similar ceremony had replaced the
protests during his three years at war. ``It would have done my
heart a lot of good to know this was going on at home instead of
what was,'' he said.
   In Louisville, Ky., about more than 200 people sang ``America
the Beautiful'' and other patriotic songs. About 150 people in
Cincinnati sang ``Let Their Be Peace on Earth,'' and a passing
barge blew its horn and flashed a light skyward.
   Residents of cities in Pennsylvania, Illinois, Virginia and
Tennessee also took part, Peter said.
   ``Trucks on the interstate passed the word by CB radio to honk
their horns for five minutes at 6:45, and churches rang their bells
,'' Peter said. ``Some of the cities were pretty far inland, like
Jackson, Tenn., and some places in central Indiana.''
   Evansville and two other Ohio River cities, Henderson and
Owensboro in Kentucky, were the first to plan the event. After
that, the idea spread up and down the river and along the
Mississippi River, Peter said.
   ``It's just mushroomed like crazy,'' he said. ``You look at the
whole thing, and that's thousands and thousands of people.''
   The event was meant to signal support for the soldiers and their
families, but made no statement about the U.S. military buildup in
the Persian Gulf prompted by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait,
Peter said.
   ``You hear lots about the little groups of anti-war
demonstrators,'' he said. ``But this is mid-America very quietly
doing their thing.''
   Almost 90 towboats operated by American Commercial Barge Line
Co. were instructed to shine their lights into the air at 6:45 p.m.
and blow their whistles, Vice President Chris Brinkop said from the
company's Jeffersonville, Ind., headquarters.
   Most of the boats were on the Ohio River, he said, with some on
the Mississippi River as well.
   ``I can't say that I remember anything like this happening
before,'' Brinkop said.
   He said the towboat crews were sympathetic with the plight of
soldiers and their families who are separated by Operation Desert
Shield.
   ``We have crews out at Christmas, and we know that's a terrible
hard time to be away from home,'' he said.
   Peter said the ceremony began with United We Stand, a support
group he formed in August for Evansville familes of soldiers
serving in Operation Desert Shield.
   Peter's son, 21-year-old Pfc. Eric Peter, is stationed in Saudi
Arabia with the Army's 82nd Airborne Division out of Fort Bragg,
N.C.
   ``What you have here I think is a major show of support for the
troops and the families,'' Peter said. ``Everyone hopes for
peace.''

   Western embassies and aid organizations
are urging their nationals to leave Somalia, where banditry,
rebellions and an accelerating breakdown of law and order put life
at risk.
   Roughly 50 or more Westerners left the capital, Mogadishu, since
last weekend following directives from the U.S., British and German
embassies and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
   The foreigners left a city beset by a steep increase in poverty
and street crime, violence from security forces, an advancing rebel
army and a collapsing economy. Observers say President Mohammed
Siad Barre faces the greatest threat to his 21-year rule.
   ``It's a terrible situation,'' said a Western diplomat who
monitors Somalia for his mission. ``It has all the classic signs of
a regime on its last legs.''
   He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Since June, six or more unexplained bombings hit diplomatic
missions and government offices and at least three foreigners died
in robberies, holdups and car thefts.
   In July, security forces fired on a soccer stadium crowd who
jeered the president, killing at least 60 people, diplomats say. In
July, the Red Beret presidential guard seized at least 36
four-wheel drive vehicles at gunpoint from Western organizations.
   The fanatically loyal Red Beret battalion, drawn from Siad
Barre's Marehan subclan, guards him around the clock. He had a
bunker built at Mogadishu's international airport, which doubles as
an air force base. Diplomats say he has been known to spend time
there. It affords a quick escape route by air.
   On Sunday, Germany ordered the nearly two dozen Germans to leave
Somalia, except for a skeleton staff at the embassy. It said it did
not know how many Germans might still be in the Horn of Africa
country for aid groups or private businesses..
   The Americans and British last weekend also advised all
non-essential personnel and dependents to leave, and urged tourists
not to visit.
   A Foreign Office spokesman in London said about 100 Britons
remain in Mogadishu.
   The State Department advisory urged the more than 100 private
American citizens in Somalia - a nation of more than 6 million
people - to leave as soon as possible. Those who stayed should keep
in touch with the embassy and use caution.
   ``Communal violence is occurring in ... Mogadishu and violent
crime and vehicle thefts are increasingly common. A state of civil
war exists in much of the countryside,'' the warning said.
   Siad Barre, who seized power in a bloodless 1969 coup, has
fought a series of clan-based rebel groups in recent years.
   Rebels of the recently formed United Somali Congress, which
springs from the large, central Hawiye clan, are reportedly within
30 miles of the capital.
   Further north, Siad Barre is challenged by the Somali National
Movement, which draws its strength from the Isaaq clan and has been
fighting to overthrow him since 1982.
   In the south, renegade Col. Omar Jess leads a force whose core
is a battalion he induced to desert with him last year. The Somalia
Patriotic Movement also operates in the south.
   As the war intensified, many fled the countryside for the
capital, where the population tripled since last one year.
   The Western diplomat blamed some capital city banditry on
Somalis who moved to Mogadishu from the nation's desert regions.
   ``They come to Mogadishu heavily armed and from a culture of
free-lance banditry,'' he said. ``They have no wherewithal. They're
nomads not used to living in cities.
   ``They are forced to shoot people to get something to eat.''

   A worker in charge of a bungee jump
that ended in death was sentenced Wednesday to 200 hours of
community service after being convicted of manslaughter.
   High Court Justice Thomas Thorp said jailing 19-year-old Jason
John Collett would achieve nothing.
   Collett was in charge of an amusement park bungee jump on Feb.
10 when Thomas Wayne Hemi, 19, died of multiple injuries after
hitting the ground.
   Participants in the thrill-seeking support jump from a bridge or
other high place with an elasticized bungee cord attached to their
ankles that is designed to stop their fall just above the surface.
Hemi's cord had not been properly secured to the tower from which
he plunged.
   The judge said Hemi was Collett's friend and the memory of what
happened would stay with him throughout his life.
   Collett had clearly been ``unacceptably lackadaisical'' on the
bungee tower, Thorp said. The jury had, however, added a strong
plea for mercy with its verdict.

   The original Budweiser brewery
will pay $6.5 million to leave government control next year and
link with its U.S. counterpart, a news agency said Tuesday.
   Budvar, the small brewery in the southern Bohemian town of Ceske
Budejovice, known as Budweis in German, has brewed its namesake
beer since the 19th century.
   Adolphus Busch, a Bavarian native, acquired the rights to sell
the beer in North America early this century.
   St. Louis-based Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc., the world's largest
beer producer, tried to set up a joint venture with Budvar in 1988,
but Communist authorities nixed the deal at the time.
   Efforts for ties between the companies were renewed following
last year's democratic revolution. Government authorities sought
compensation from Budvar in exchange for independence and the right
to use the famous trademark.
   Budvar workers went on strike Monday in an effort to speed up
the talks.
   Antonin Kratochvile, general manager of the state-controlled
brewery chain Jihoceske Pivovary, said Monday that Budvar had
agreed to pay the group $6.5 million for independence.
   ``After long negotiations which lasted almost a year the
conflict was finally resolved,'' the official CTK news agency
reported.
   CTK said the brewery would be independent in January.
   ``The Budvar beer is being brewed again for local distribution
and export as well,'' CTK added.
   Details of a possible U.S-Czech joint venture have not been
disclosed.

   The truck stops here, says Vincent
Gramuglia, at least until he can figure out his next move.
   Gramuglia's controversial tractor-trailer truck sign was pulled
Monday from its 50-foot perch alongside the New York State Thruway
and became lodged against the same storage tank it was ordered
removed from by a judge.
   ``We've got a unique problem,'' Gramuglia said. ``The truck is
stuck.''
   Gramuglia's 55-foot rig sat atop an empty oil storage tank and
served as a huge billboard to advertise the ``three truck stops,
four motels and seven restaurants'' available off the highway in
Fultonville, about 40 miles west of Albany.
   After a yearlong battle with Thruway Authority officials, who
said the sign was a distraction to motorists, Gramuglia agreed in
state Supreme Court last week to take the sign down. On Monday,
with about 75 people and three television news crews on hand, he
tried to do just that.
   Gramuglia, owner of the Countryside Fuel Stop, said he used
torches to cut where the truck was welded to a huge steel I-beam.
He placed rollers under the I-beam, greased the whole operation
with Italian olive oil and used a tow truck's winch to pull the
truck off.
   When the 12-ton truck fell, its back end wedged itself 4 to 6
feet into the ground, with the cab leaning on the storage tank,
Gramuglia said. Further attempts to winch the truck off resulted in
two broken steel cables, he said.
   ``They can't say we didn't comply with the Supreme Court
ruling,'' said Gramuglia, who admitted he was having a good laugh
over the problem. ``We'll take it off eventually, but we'll leave
it like that for a few days.''
   ``It's more of distraction now than it was when it was sitting
on top of the tank,'' he said.

   The Bush administration plans to ask U.S.
allies to chip in more money to offset the enormous cost of sending
and sustaining more than 400,000 American troops in the Persian
Gulf, the Pentagon said Tuesday.
   The Pentagon also announced that Iraq now has more than half a
million troops in and around Kuwait - 50,000 more than U.S.
intelligence estimates of a week ago and five times the size of the
army that invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on Monday said a continuing Iraqi
buildup indicated that President Saddam Hussein has no intention of
giving up Kuwait, despite the optimism generated by Saddam's
release of American and other hostages.
   In an interview Tuesay night on CNN's ``Larry King Live''
program, White House chief of staff John Sununu was asked if
Hussein would pull out of Kuwait. ``I think right now it's 50-50,
and it's hard to give a better answer than that,'' Sununu replied.
   As a second planeload of Americans left Iraq on Tuesday bound
for Frankfurt, Germany, and then the United States, the White House
said an evacuation flight scheduled for Thursday probably will be
the last to leave Iraq and probably will carry the remaining staff
of the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait.
   ``We would anticipate that once all Americans who want out have
been able to get out that we would remove the entire staff of the
embassy,'' said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Fitzwater said that for diplomatic and political purposes, Bush
would like to leave the American flag flying above the embassy to
signify that it is an active U.S. outpost.
   ``From a practical matter, we won't have anyone there to raise
the flag. So, that'll just play itself out,'' Fitzwater said.
   The evacuation of U.S. civilians coincided with a further
buildup of U.S. troops in the area.
   Pete Williams, a Pentagon spokesman, said American air, sea and
ground forces in the gulf area have risen by 10,000 since last
week, to 260,000. The latest arrivals apparently are the lead
elements of a huge U.S. reinforcement that President Bush ordered
Nov. 8 to strengthen the U.S. offensive capability.
   By late January about 430,000 U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force and
Marine Corps personnel are expected to be in the area - the largest
U.S. expeditionary force since the Vietnam war.
   Williams also announced that ground, sea and air forces
dispatched to the gulf area from Britain, France and 24 other
allied nations now total more than 220,000. He said he could not
disclose how many forces were sent by each country.
   Bush's decision to expand Operation Desert Shield deployments
beyond the 240,000 originally planned in August threw a monkey
wrench into the Pentagon's efforts to estimate future costs. And it
added urgency to determining how much more money and materials
allied nations may be willing to contribute.
   Williams said allies have offered $6.5 billion in assistance
through Dec. 31.
   ``We will probably seek additional support from other nations to
continue their share of the responsibility for Desert Shield,''
Williams said, adding that the Pentagon has not yet determined how
much the operation will cost next year.
   The Pentagon's original estimate of $15 billion for the budget
year that began Oct. 1 is no longer valid, Williams said, because
it was made before Bush ordered the U.S. reinforcements.
   Pentagon and congressional sources said Monday the 1991 cost of
the operation could be about $30 billion, but they stressed that
estimates are uncertain because of fluctuations in fuel prices and
other changing circumstances. The biggest unknown is whether the
U.S. forces will go to war.
   Williams didn't say which allies would be asked to increase
their contributions, or when.
   The leading contributors to the U.S. military operation since it
began Aug. 7 are Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Germany and the
United Arab Emirates, Williams said.
   Williams said Kuwait has provided the most aid so far, $2.5
billion in cash. Saudi Arabia has provided services and materials,
such as transportation, food and fuel, valued at $987 million
through Oct. 31, Williams said. He said the Saudis, unlike other
allies, have made an ``open-ended offer'' of assistance for the
duration of the standoff with Iraq.
   Japan has provided $376 million in cash and $50 million in
materials or services, and Germany has given $272 million in cash
and $65 million in support, Williams said. Neither of those
countries has sent military forces to the gulf.
   Williams said Congress, in passing a supplemental appropriation
of $1.9 billion for Desert Shield expenses for August and
September, established a Defense Cooperation Account into which all
allied financial aid is being deposited. The balance in the account
as of Nov. 30 was $3.9 billion, Williams said.

decision not related to Curran case. Picks up 4th graf, `Auburn

<TEXT>
   A millionaire who underwrote Auburn
University's hiring of a controversial Catholic theologian says he
will give no more to the school that denied tenure to the Rev.
Charles Curran.
   ``I understand they're taking it out on him because he's a
Catholic. Some of my best friends are Catholic,'' J.W. Goodwin,
owner of a Birmingham engineering firm, said Monday in a story
Tuesday in The Montgomery Advertiser.
   Goodwin backed away from the comment Tuesday, saying he didn't
know if Curran was denied tenure because of his religion.
   Goodwin told The Associated Press on Tuesday he wrote his alma
mater out of his will because of ``a personal matter'' but would
not elaborate.
   ``It didn't have anything to do with that preacher,'' Goodwin
said.
   Auburn University President James Martin has refused to make
public the reason he gave Curran a one-year contract, rather than
the security of a tenured position, when Curran was named
Goodwin-Philpott Eminent Scholar in Religion, beginning with the
1990 fall term.
   Goodwin, 86, who donated $600,000 to set up the chair at Auburn,
said it did not bother him that Curran has been censured by the
Vatican for arguing that in some circumstances homosexual acts and
abortion might not be sinful.
   Martin met privately Friday with the 13-member,
faculty-controlled Promotions and Tenure Committee, but his reason
for denying Curran tenure remained secret. While the committee that
had overwhelmingly recommended last May that Curran be given tenure
issued a statement in support of Martin's action, some faculty
leaders said the problem had been aggravated.
   ``I am fully anticipating some rather strong reaction from the
faculty if they cannot fathom the meaning of all this,'' said
Auburn faculty senate President Gary Mullen.
   The university senate is expected to address the issue Jan. 8.
   Ronald Henry, an Auburn vice president who is chairman of the
tenure committee, said he would never disclose Martin's
``non-academic'' reasons for denying tenure.
   Curran replied, ``If they admit it's a non-academic judgment,
they have admitted it's a violation of academic freedom.''
   Goodwin said Martin and former Auburn President Harry Philpott
told him that Curran was ``the man they thought would be good for
the job, and I said, `If it's all right with you, it's all right
with me.'''
   Some faculty members had speculated earlier that Martin was
under pressure from Catholic quarters not to give Curran a
long-term post. But Goodwin said he was convinced Martin was
persuaded by an unnamed member of the board of trustees not to make
Curran's hiring permanent because the trustee objected to the fact
that Curran was Catholic.
   Curran was added to a two-member religion department that
already has a tenured Catholic professor.
   Goodwin's $600,000 donation was part of some $8 million he has
contributed to his alma mater over the years.
   Goodwin, a 1929 engineering graduate, first let his displeasure
be known in a letter to Martin, informing him that he had stopped
bids on a new veterinary building he was bankrolling ``until this
Curran thing is cleared up.''
   Auburn's College of Veterinary Medicine was planning to use a
large contribution from Goodwin to build a $750,000 laboratory for
the artificial breeding of horses.
   ``I'd be glad to reconsider,'' said Goodwin, ``but they're going
to have to get some people off that board of trustees. I'm not
going to let them play hanky-panky with the money I worked like
hell for.''

   Pro-Cuban guerrillas forced company helicopter
pilots to help them bomb installations of a subcontractor for the
American company Mobil Oil Corp. in a northern jungle region, a
leftist senator said Tuesday.
   Sen. Edmundo Murugarra said about 150 members of the Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement hit drilling operations Monday in the Upper
Huallaga River Valley.
   He said the rebels forced the pilots to fly over the site while
the guerrillas dynamited the installations from the air.
   The minister of energy and mines, Fernando Sanchez Albavera,
said Tuesday the attack caused $3 million in damage. He said it was
``important to stress Mobil's decision to continue to work in
Peru'' despite the raid.
   Mobil and U.S. Embassy officials refused to comment on the
attack.
   The Upper Huallaga is a coca-rich jungle area 200 miles
northeast of Lima. It also contains most of Peru's oil reserves.
   The valley produces more than 60 percent of the world's supply
of coca leaf, the raw material for cocaine.
   Hundreds of guerrillas from both of Peru's main rebel groups
operate in the area, providing protection for drug traffickers in
exchange for arms and cash.
   Tupac Amaru, a smaller and less dangerous rebel organization
than the Maoist-oriented Shining Path movement, started attacks in
1984.
   Guerrillas thought to belong to Shining Path on Tuesday tried to
assassinate a district attorney in Cuzco, 350 miles southeast of
Lima, police said.
   Cuzco, the ancient Inca capital and gateway to the Inca citadel
Machu Picchu, is one of Peru's principal tourist attractions. The
city has been relatively free of guerrilla attacks, except for a
car bomb three months ago.
   Shining Path rebels on Monday bombed state electricity company
offices in the northern mountain city of Huaraz, police said
Tuesday.
   Huaraz, 175 miles north of Lima, is a popular area for
backpackers and mountain climbers. Guerrilla violence has increased
in the area since the Shining Path killed a British backpacker
outside Huaraz in May 1989.
   More than 21,000 people have died in political violence since
the Shining Path took up arms in 1980.

   Two chain reaction crashes in dense fog on
a highway in southeastern Tennessee killed 15 people Tuesday,
injured more than 50 and left the roadway looking like a war zone.
   A morning fog covered Interstate 75 over the Hiwassee River,
about 40 miles north of Chattanooga, when the 75-vehicle pileup
began about 9:30 a.m., said Cecil Whaley, director of the Tennessee
Emergency Management Agency.
   People involved in the accident, which covered more than a mile
of the interstate, described hearing booms in the fog as dozens of
tractor-trailers collided with each other and with cars.
   Traveling salesman Ralph Fisher of Cleveland, Tenn., was headed
north when he hit the fog patch. He said he noticed traffic slowing
down so he pulled to the roadside.
   ``After that I started hearing bangs and booms from everywhere.
Immediately after that there was a truck on fire from across the
road. We stared hearing them banging and booming from over there.
Then all of a sudden you started hearing them from everywhere,''
said Fisher, 43.
   Whaley confirmed 15 dead, but said the number could rise as
crews searched the burned shells of vehicles. In some cases, only
nameplates distinguished the wreckage of a car smashed into the
side of a truck.
   ``This is one of the worst accidents that anyone can remember
happening in Tennessee in terms of the number of vehicles and
fatalities involved,'' said Whaley, who followed rescue efforts
from his Nashville office.
   Names of the victims would not be immediately released because
some of the bodies were burned beyond recognition, Whaley said.
   Authorities believe an initial accident occurred in the
southbound lane, and cars jumping the median or people
rubbernecking to see the southbound crash may have caused the
second pileup in the northbound lane.
   From there, authorities say it was a ghastly chain reaction.
   Russell Newman, eastern district regional director of the
Tennessee Emergency Medical Agency, says no one is really sure what
happened.
   ``It's just a conjecture as to what caused it, but it was just
one of those damn chain reaction collisions that happen in this
kind of situation - very heavy fog and probably too much speed,''
Newman said.
   In Washington, the National Transportation Safety Board said it
was dispatching a six-person team of experts in highway and
hazardous material investigations.
   One northbound lane of the interstate was reopened to traffic
Tuesday afternoon. TEMA official Gary Beazley said he didn't know
when the other lanes would be reopened.
   Efforts earlier in the day to remove the injured to hospitals in
Athens and Cleveland were hampered because of wreckage. Helicopters
from Knoxville and Chattanooga helped with the evacuation.
   Joe Wilson, spokesman for the Bradley County Emergency
Management Agency, said the worst of the accident was centered at a
bridge over the Hiwassee River, where the worst of the accident was
centered.
   Bradley Memorial treated 24 people and Athens Community Hospital
received 20 people. People were treated for lacerations, multiple
trauma, burns, fractures, contusions and smoke inhalation.
   At least six seriously injured people were airlifted to
Chattanooga's Erlanger Hospital and one was transported to the
University of Tennessee Medical Center in Knoxville, Whaley said.
   He said about 20 of the 51 injured had been released from
hospitals.
   Some troopers were overcome by fumes shortly after the accident,
but officials said the danger had dissipated by midday. A propane
tanker involved in the wreck was not damaged, officials said.

<HEAD>Black Leader Says Race Relations at Stake In Fiesta Bowl</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Race relations will suffer if the
University of Alabama plays in the Fiesta Bowl in Arizona, where
voters rejected a holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr., a black
leader said Tuesday.
   State Rep. Alvin Holmes, Alabama NAACP president Lillian Jackson
and several other black leaders met with University President Roger
Sayers to discuss their concerns over the planned trip to the Jan.
1 college football bowl in Tempe, Ariz.
   The fact that Alabama, one of the state's major institutions, is
planning to participate in the event is particularly significant,
Holmes said.
   ``Here in the state of Alabama was where Dr. Martin Luther King
was thrust into international leadership,'' he said. ``It was here
in the state of Alabama where Martin Luther King received his
greatest resistance to the civil rights movement and it was here in
the state of Alabama where (former Gov.) George Wallace stood in
the schoolhouse door.
   ``Of all universities in the nation, the University of Alabama
should be the last one to play in a state where they refuse to
honor Dr. King,'' Holmes said.
   Holmes said he wants the team to pull out of the game against
Louisville.
   The black leaders presented a list of demands to Sayers, which
included hiring a black university vice president and establishing
a scholarship for black students.
   Sayers said the university will consider the proposals and come
up with a package next week.
   King's daughter, Yolanda King, canceled an acting performance in
a musical play in Arizona on Sunday because she felt her presence
there might be misconstrued.
   Sayers had been scheduled to meet with Southern Christian
Leadership Conference officials, but the meeting was canceled.
Instead, SCLC President Joseph Lowery met with Gov. Guy Hunt in
Montgomery on Tuesday evening.
   Hunt's press secretary, Terry Abbott, said the governor told
Lowery he ``respectfully disagreed'' with his stance and that Hunt
``knows well that university officials are very sensitive to the
issues.''
   ``I understand his position and I hope he understands mine,''
said Lowery.
   John Nettles, president of the Alabama SCLC, said Lowery's
meeting with Sayers would be rescheduled.

<TEXT>
   North Korea said Wednesday that peace
on the divided Korean peninsula must be achieved without
interference from outsiders and it indirectly attacked Seoul's
alliances with both Washington and Moscow.
   ``We only wonder when this dependence on outside forces and
flunky-like way of thinking, impairing national dignity and
interests, will disappear,'' Premier Yon Hyong Muk of North Korea
said.
   He spoke at the opening of the third round of talks between
himself and South Korean Premier Kang Young-hoon.
   ``If we depend upon foreign forces, we cannot but be subjected
to their interference, cannot but be worried about their
attitude,'' Yon said. ``You are entreating foreign countries for
intervention and interference in an endeavor to force your will.''
   The talks are meant to ease political and military tensions on
the peninsula.
   South Korean President Roh Tae-woo flies to Moscow Thursday for
a summit with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Moscow, a
longtime ally of the Communist North, established diplomatic
relations with Seoul two months ago. Roh's trip has been bitterly
critized by the North as an attempt to sabotage the talks.
   The opening day session lasted about two hours and both sides
offered proposals which were little changed in substance from past
talks. No major agreement is expected, but the talks are seen as
one more step in the lengthy process of drawing the two nations
closer.
   The talks, to conclude Thursday, are the third round since
September and the highest-level meetings between the Koreas since
the peninsula was divided in 1945 and the border tightly sealed.
   Yon demanded immediate withdrawal of 43,000 U.S. troops based in
South Korea, withdrawal of U.S. nuclear weapons he claims are
stored in the South and a halt to the annual U.S.-South Korean
military maneuver called Team Spirit.
   He asked direct talks between North Korea and Washington on
replacing the 1953 armistice agreement which ended the 1950-53
Korean War with a peace treaty. South Korea refused to sign the
armistice.
   South Korea urged the North to sign a basic agreement aimed at
easing 45 years of confrontation and to accept two ideological
systems pending unification.
   South Korea warned the North to cease what it said was its
slandering of Roh and to end contacts with South Korean dissidents.
   ``Your side has continued to slander and revile our side even
though you have agreed to talk peace and reconciliation,'' said
Kang.
   ``Your side is inciting and encouraging certain dissidents in
the South to conduct illegal activities.''
   North Korea has demanded the release of dissidents jailed for
unauthorized contact with the North, a matter the Seoul government
calls meddling in domestic affairs.
   On Tuesday, hours after the North Korean premier crossed the
heavily fortified border, police in the southern city of Kwangju
stormed two universities to try to block students from screening
banned North Korean movies.
   The national Yonhap News Agency said about 1,000 students
hurling rocks and firebombs drove 1,000 riot police out of Chonnam
University. Students barricaded the school's main gate with tires
and desks, it said.
   At Kwangju's Chosun University, police firing tear gas stormed
the school but were driven back by 500 students, Yonhap said.
   Police arrested four students, it said. There was no report on
injuries.
   In a prelude to the talks, the premiers sang Korea's national
anthem for unification in an emotional ceremony on Tuesday.
   The two stood side by side in an auditorium filled with 2,000
cheering spectators and sang the song, which starts, ``Our wish is
unification.''

   City officials sought Tuesday to close a
nightclub owned by rap singer Luther Campbell of 2 Live Crew after
one man was killed and another wounded in a weekend gunfight there.
   City Attorney Alex Vilarello filed papers Tuesday in Dade
Circuit Court seeking an injunction closing the Strawberry Too
club. He said a hearing on the request was not expected before
Friday.
   Campbell, who has owned the club for two years, was acquitted of
obscenity charges in Florida's Broward County in October that
stemmed from a concert featuring songs from his group's album ``As
Nasty As They Wanna Be.'' Also acquitted were 2 Live Crew members
Mark ``Brother Marquis'' Ross and Chris ``Fresh Kid Ice'' Wongwon
   The Hialeah City Council, meeting in emergency session Monday,
ordered Vilarello to seek the injunction after Saturday morning's
gunfight terrorized an estimated 200 patrons of the club.
   Police said the shooting was the latest violent outburst at the
club where two people were wounded in another gunfight in the
parking lot last July.
   ``Forty to 60 percent of available manpower is being expended at
this location continuously,'' said Police Chief Rolando Bolanos.
   Police say they have been summoned to the club 128 times this
year, including five times for shootings.
   Campbell said police were to blame for not controlling crowds
outside the club.
   ``I think the city of Hialeah is full of it, personally, because
every club in the city of Miami, Miami Beach, all over the county,
has police outside of the club,'' Campbell said.
   Police said Saturday's incident began about 4 a.m. when
Campbell's bodyguard, Robert Mulkey, poked Timothy Taylor, 22, in
the head and told him he couldn't enter the club, which was being
used for a private party.
   Taylor allegedly hit Mulkey over the head with a portable
telephone and fled. Police said Mulkey then hit Taylor over the
head with his gun, grazing him when the weapon discharged.
   The single gunshot prompted an outburst of more than 50 shots,
and Morris Richard Anderson III, a bystander, was killed. Anderson,
22, was shot in the back.
   Authorities said it wasn't immediately clear how many people
were involved in the gunfight.

   A new contraceptive touted by family planning
experts as the most effective, reversible method of birth control
will soon be available to American women.
   The Food and Drug Administration approved Norplant on Monday,
clearing the way for Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories to begin training
health practitioners how to insert the implant that can prevent
pregnancy for up to five years.
   ``It's going to be interesting to watch what kind of reaction
Norplant gets among the public and physicians,'' said Jeannie
Rosoff, president of the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a research and
policy group that focuses on reproductive health issues.
   ``There are going to be some women for whom this is a godsend.
The numbers we don't know yet,'' she said. ``But any new addition

   CHICAGO (AP) - Federal investigators said they have new reason
to believe a body found in a forest 12 years ago is that of missing
candy heiress Helen Brach, an official said.
   ``We developed additional information, which we felt significant
enough to warrant a re-examination of the body,'' Jerry Singer, a
spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms,
said Monday.
   He declined to describe the new information.
   A court order was granted to exhume the body, which is buried in
a pauper's grave.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - A group of joyful Americans are home for the
holidays today, relieved to be free after more than four
frightening, boring and unpleasant months as captives in Iraq and
Kuwait.
   ``It feels absolutely great,'' Jack Rinehart, 37, of Stover,
Mo., said several hours after he and more than 150 Americans landed
at nearby Andrews Air Force Base, Md., on a chartered Pan Am jumbo
jet Monday.
   ``It's great to be back,'' said Dwight Durmon of Fayetteville,
Tenn., as he clutched the hand of his wife, Cathy.
   The former hostages - some of whom had been held as ``human
shields'' at strategic sites in Iraq - left Baghdad on Sunday.

   EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) - Columbia glided to a rare
night landing a day early after a star-gazing mission plagued by
computer problems, clogged plumbing and finally the threat of rain.
   The shuttle touched down Monday night, its signature twin sonic
booms heralding its arrival over the Mojave Desert. The landing,
seen by about 600 spectators, was moved up to avoid rain in today'sforecast.
   NASA officials focused on the mission's accomplishments, despite
repeated problems aiming the $150 million Astro observatory.
Besides the telescope troubles, the crew had to repair a clog in
the shuttle's waste collection system.
   ``I think we've had a resounding success on the mission,'' said
William Lenoir, NASA associate administrator.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Armand Hammer, the communist's son who became
an American captain of industry as well-connected in the Kremlin as
he was on Wall Street, has died at age 92.
   Hammer died at his home Monday night after a brief illness, said
Frank Ashley, a spokesman for Hammer's Occidental Petroleum Corp.
   Hammer, a self-made millionaire by the time he graduated from
Columbia University medical school at age 23, was also a
philanthropist, art collector and crusader for world peace.
   ``He was absolutely indomitable,'' said his attorney, Arthur
Groman. ``He never lost his courage or tenacity. In the last
months, he was uncomplaining and optimistic.''

   MOSCOW (AP) - The highly publicized Soviet food shortage is most
acute in big Russian cities and seems milder in the countryside,
smaller cities and in non-Russian republics, a survey indicates.
   ``The situation is better here than in Russia,'' said Povilas
Klimas, deputy mayor of Vilnius, capital of the Baltic republic of
Lithuania, which declared independence in March. ``We're ready to
go ahead on our own.''
   Officials from the 12 cities surveyed by The Associated Press
said there was more food in farmers' markets than in state stores,
although prices were higher. They blamed shortages on panic-buying
and the collapse of the centralized distribution system, which is
not getting the harvest into cities.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has appealed to the West for food
to prevent winter unrest that he says may jeopardize his reforms.
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze carried the plea Monday to
Secretary of State James A. Baker III.

   LONDON (AP) - British aid agencies say millions of people in the
four corners of Africa face starvation as early as January, and
some compare the situation to the Ethiopian famine that shocked the
world five years ago.
   John Magrath, a spokesman for the Oxfam charity, said Monday he
had received a telex from a worker just back from the Ethiopian
province of Eritrea:
   ``Terrible drought,'' it said. ``Animals dying. People already
on the move.''
   Oxfam has joined with six other agencies to form the British
Disaster Emergency Committee, which is launching an appeal in the
new year for funds to assist Ethiopia, the Sudan, Mozambique,
Angola and Liberia.

   SPRINGFIELD, Va. (AP) - Incredulous motorists who pull into U.T.
Brown's filling station might wonder if they hadn't taken the wrong
turn and wandered into an amusement park.
   The landscaping around Cardinal Plaza Shell's gasoline pumps
includes a Japanese rock garden with stone dragons and pagodas, a
five-foot fiberglass Ninja Turtle and a miniature putting green
surrounded by sand traps.
   To help his customers fill 'er up with the Christmas spirit,
Brown has scattered his gardens with nine welded-wire reindeer and
a sleigh, all blinking with hundreds of tiny white lights. And, of
course, a red-nosed Rudolph stands watch over his herd from a perch
above the garage.
   There's a 25-foot illuminated Christmas tree on the roof of the
gas pump bays, 500 red and white lamps bordering the immaculate
lawn, and a giant candy cane decorating the tire racks.

<HEAD>Norway Hopes to be Smoke-Free in 10 Years</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Norway, which already has the world's most
expensive cigarettes, is trying to stop smoking everywhere indoors
and wipe out the habit in a decade.
   Even a smoker's home may not be his castle for long. Schools and
day-care centers tell children about the dangers of passive smoking
and encourage them to tell their parents to quit or smoke outside.
   Norwegians with tobacco habits are responding by rolling their
own cigarettes, using butts over again, taking snuff and smoking on
balconies.
   Tore Sanner, a professor at the Oslo Cancer Institute and head
of the smoke-free campaign, granted that the number of smokers has
remained constant for 10 years despite increasingly aggressive
measures.
   About 1.2 million Norwegians smoke, or 37 percent of the
population, but fewer young people are starting. Tobacco
consumption has dropped only marginally, to 6,700 metric tons a
year from 6,800 in 1980.
   Sanner, in no mood to give up, declared: ``You saw what happened
to the Berlin Wall. Nobody thought it would fall.''
   Tobacco advertising has been prohibited since 1975. Smoking is
forbidden in all public transportation, in terminals, museums and
other indoor public places.
   A 2-year-old law bans smoking in any office where there is more
than one person.
   Because 85 percent of the price is taxes and fees, a pack of 20
cigarettes costs 31 kroner, or $5.40. The government proposes to
raise the price by another 10 percent next year.
   Some Norwegians are as stubborn about smoking as Sanner is about
getting them to quit.
   On a snowy day in downtown Oslo, Bjoerne Ulvaes, 28, took a last
deep drag before his streetcar arrived. He put the cigarette out
and slid it back into the pack, his fingers shaking with cold,
before getting aboard.
   ``You do cut down,'' Ulvaes said, but added he did not intend to
quit.
   Many people doubt they will see a smoke-free society in Norway.
Taxes of 250 percent and numerous restrictions did not stop people
from drinking alcohol, but did lead to widespread bootlegging and
home distilling.
   Customers at the Manhattan Pub laughed, shook their heads at the
idea and continued smoking. A saleswoman in a tobacco store said
trying to end smoking in 10 years was ``ridiculous and out of touch
with reality.''
   Nonetheless, new restrictions are planned. In two years,
restaurants will be required to keep one-third of their space
smoke-free. Plans are being made to raise the age limit for buying
tobacco from 16 to 18.
   High-tar brands probably will be banned and cigarette prices
will continue going up.
   Sanner said his campaign alliance, which includes the Norwegian
Sports Association, is lobbying to have the price raised 20 percent
each year.
   Anne-Marie Mueller of the government's National Council on
Tobacco Unhealth said new regulations are needed to stem the
increase in hand-rolling and the use of snuff.
   Scandinavians squeeze snuff into a small ball and put it between
the gum and inner side of the lip. More people use it as smoking
becomes more expensive and restricted.
   Ms. Mueller said her council wants prices of all tobacco
products raised because ``price is our most important weapon.''
   Smokers have begun organizing against what they call the ``ban
mentality.''
   ``It is a matter of freedom of choice,'' said Thor Petter
Krosby, a non-smoker who heads the 2-year-old smokers' organization
Smokepeace.
   ``There is an air of fanaticism'' about anti-smoking activists,
he said in remarks about proposals to ban smoking entirely at Oslo
University, indoors or out.
   Krosby said Smokepeace does not encourage people to smoke, but
that most of its 300 members are smokers.
   Anti-smokers are trying to soften their image with the help of
NRK, the state-controlled television network. It carries no product
commercials, but does broadcast anti-smoking advertisements.
   Some recent ads have a touch of humor. In one, Dracula sinks his
teeth into the throat of a young chain smoker, then staggers away
coughing, smoke pouring from his mouth.

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Two-Sided Stories: The Novels of David Lodge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   David Lodge is on his first American publicity
tour and the English author seems a little dazed.
   Blame some of it on jet lag, the rest on culture shock. When his
first novel came out in 1962, writers didn't give interviews. In
fact, Lodge waited years before he even had a public reading.
   But he'll have to adjust. This mild-mannered author is now,
somewhat, a celebrity. His claim to fame is such gently mischievous
novels as ``Changing Places,'' ``Small World'' and ``Nice Work,''
which has just been issued in paperback.
   These stories always have two sides - men vs. women, religion
vs. secularism, America vs. England. And Lodge is the referee,
laying down the rules and calmly watching from the sidelines as
characters collide and opinions crumble.
   ``The very first novel I published, `The Picturegoers,' is about
an agnostic boy and a Catholic girl, and as a result of their
relationship she becomes agnostic and he becomes religious,'' Lodge
said, relaxing in an armchair in his Manhattan hotel room.
   ``Because I don't have very strong political or idealistic ideas
to put forth myself, I find it easy to put forth novels of
contrasting views. I also find it humorous, working on a level
where everybody understands the rules and obeys them.''
   Lodge, born in 1935, grew up in southeast London. His childhood
was often grim and, as he writes in the introduction to ``Out of
the Shelter,'' an autobiographical novel, his irreverent sense of
humor was shaped by air raids and postwar austerity.
   In ``Nice Work,'' the author toys with the stuffy Victor Wilcox
and the overeducated Robyn Penrose, throwing them together in an
uneasy merger of the smokestack and the ivory tower.
   Wilcox is the manager of an engineering firm, his quest for
identity reaching no further than his resume. Penrose, who teaches
classes on 19th century industrial novels, would rather read about
factories than actually visit them.
   Lodge takes these imaginary creatures and sets them in a cage
called Rummidge, an English city that occupies, for fictional
purposes, ``the space where Birmingham is to be found on maps of
the so-called real world.''
   The year is 1986, the government has proclaimed it ``Industry
Year,'' and a university panel has developed an Industry Year
Shadow Scheme: a faculty member is to ``shadow'' a senior
management employee in local manufacturing. Robyn gets the
assignment. Her subject, naturally, is Victor.
   Here's a boy-meets-girl story set against the background of a
city's crumbling economy. Victor, pompous and materialistic, finds
himself falling in love with this attractive, independent woman.
Robyn is horrified by her initial exposure to the lue-collar
world, but slowly realizes machines and assembly lines are no less
important than analyses of Jane Austen.
   An encounter is inevitible and Lodge, keeping the sex safe,
writes with the detached amusement of a nosy neighbor whose ear is
pressed against the wall:
   ``Robyn's mood is blythe. She feels mildly wanton, but not
wicked. She sees herself as not seducing Vic but as putting him out
of his misery. ... Perhaps she feels a certain sense of triumph at
her conquest: the captain of industry at the feet of the feminist
literary critic - a pleasing tableau.
   ``For Vic the event is indefinitely more momentous, his mood
infinitely more perturbed. The prospect of going to bed with Robyn
Penrose is the secret dream of weeks come true. ... He regards
himself with wonderment led by the hand by this handsome young
woman toward her bedroom, as if his soul is stumbling along out of
step behind his body.''
   ``The scene where they actually go to bed together, I must have
written about 10 times; it took a lot of thinking,'' explained
Lodge, who in 1987 retired as a professor at the University of
Birmingham.
   Robyn is far more serious, even questioning the very idea of
novels, which she attacks as capitalist tools. ``The message of the
novel is clear,'' she states. ``The alienation of work under
industrial capitalism can be overcome by an infusion of loving
kindness and imaginative play ... ''
   That's going too far for Lodge. Feminism is up for grabs, so are
religion and politics, but the author doesn't mind sounding a
little dogmatic about writing, the only time he's willing to
solemnly bow his head and offers thanks to a power greater than his
own.
   ``We learn how to negotiate our lives through novels,'' Lodge
said. ``We learn about experiences beyond our own. A novel is not
the only form that does that, but I still think it's the most
versatile of all forms. You don't need much money, all you need as
a writer is a pad and a pen.
   ``When you get to my stage of life, you don't ask yourself why
you write. It's sort of what you've become; you're a novelist. It's
like being a professional golfer.''

<HEAD>`Arctic Wars' and `Playing God with Nature': About Hard Choices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many people find it easy to support the idea of
wildlife conservation and the environment, until it gets
uncomfortable, until choices and distinctions become difficult to
make.
   That's the tacit message of ``Arctic Wars,'' a one-hour PBS
special tonight on Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which
already is staked out as ``the environmental battleground of the
1990s.''
   It's also the message of ``Africa: Playing God with Nature?,'' a
National Geographic Explorer special on TBS Sunday that shows three
African nations' different approaches to wildlife conservation.
   Take the tundra: At the northeast boundary of Alaska, beside the
Yukon Territory, is the 19 million-acre Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge, a wilderness area created by Congress in 1980.
   Under the congressional act's Section 1002, the refuge's 1.5
million-acre coastal plain is exempted from the wilderness
designation. Why? The oil industry figures the so-called
``ten-oh-two'' lands sit on more than 2{ billion barrels of oil.
   The 1002 lands are core calving grounds for the porcupine
caribou, and prime habitat for the wolf and grizzly bear.
Unfortunately, porcupine caribou aren't cute, grizzlies are scary,
and wolves have suffered from bad press.
   It's also the homeland of native Indians and Eskimos who rely on
the caribou for their subsistence. And yet, there are Alaskans who
also need jobs in an economy that derives 85 percent of its
revenues from the oil industry.
   What will become of the lands? The oil companies insist the
adjoining oil fields at Prudhoe Bay are in decline, that they'll
need the oil and that they can get it out and return the wilderness
to ``useful tundra.''
   Useful tundra?
   ``The official position of the Bush administration concerning
ANWR and other areas is that we'll go forward with exploration and
drilling if we can do it in an environmentally sound manner,'' says
Assisant Interior Secretary David O'Neil.
   ``Arctic Wars'' makes it all too clear that the 1002 lands
probably would be open to oil exploration and development today if
it weren't for the Exxon Valdez oil spill of 1989.
   As one oil executive argues, ``If you perceive that the
aesthetics of a drilling rig destroy wilderness, then we've reduced
the argument to one of aesthetics, which is a very difficult
argument.''
   What ``Arctic Wars'' doesn't make clear is that oil development,
or even extensive recreational use, threatens species plants,
animals, insects and microscopic life we know nothing about. Once
gone, it is gone for good.
   The other side of conservation is in Africa, where Kenya,
Zimbabwe and South Africa have taken three fundamentally different
tacks in managing wildlife.
   The problem is most critical in Kenya, where the world's highest
birth rate and endemic poverty have decimated wildlife and habitat.
Where humans compete with animals for food and space, animals
always lose.
   Disastrous policies by Kenya's government in the '70s literally
destroyed one game preserve by overpopulating it with elephants,
and created enormous ill will among its people by denying them
access to game during famine.
   Kenya's war on poachers and a worldwide ban on ivory have helped
save the dwindling elephant herd. Tourism is Kenya's largest source
of hard currency, and that also may help the elephant.
   This is small consolation to a Kenyan farmer trying to eke out a
living on lands adjoining unfenced game preserves. To him, the
elephant that eats and tramples his crops is a 2{-ton cockroach.
   Zimbabwe takes a sensible, if unsentimental, approach, in
demanding that wildlife ``pay its own way,'' with licensed trophy
and meat harvesting. Local people are ``given'' their wildlife as
manageable assets.
   Then there's South Africa's intensively managed Kruger Nation
Park - a fenced area the size of Massachusetts, where as many as
400 elephants - usually old males - are killed each year to keep
the population in balance.
   ``Arctic Wars'' and ``Playing God with Nature?'' don't answer
questions, they pose them. It's our planet. What shall we do with
it?
   ---
   Elsewhere in television ...
   PUBLIC TV AUDIENCE STILL GROWING: Public television increased
its audience by 9 percent in November, its second straight month of
audience growth in the fall season, the Public Broadcasting Service
says.
   November's prime-time rating was an average 2.4, up from 2.2
during November 1989. October's 2.3 rating was up 10 percent over
the same period last year, according to A.C. Nielsen Co. figures,
PBS said.
   A rating point equals 931,000 TV households, so PBS averaged
nearly 2.5 million households tuned in. That's minuscule compared
with commercial TV ratings, but sheer bliss to PBS executives and
their audience.
   PBS also reports its member-support pledges are running 6
percent over last December's pledge period.

<HEAD>Sydney Pollack and Robert Redford Team for ``Havana''</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If anyone can get Robert Redford back on the
screen, it's Sydney Pollack, and the talented pair combine again
for a drama against the backdrop of the 1958 Cuban revolution,
``Havana.''
   The film marks the seventh collaboration for the unlikely pair:
the outgoing Jewish Hoosier, and the secretive, golden-haired
California blond.
   Their previous movies: ``This Property Is Condemned,'' ``Three
Days of the Condor,'' ``Jeremiah Johnson,'' ``The Way We Were,''
``The Electric Horseman,'' ``Out of Africa,'' the latter winning
Pollack the 1985 Academy Award for director.
   Pollack and Redford met in 1961 when both were unknown actors
working in Denis Sander's anti-war film, ``War Hunt.'' Pollack had
aimed for an acting career ever since leaving Lafayette, Ind., at
the age of 17 and enrolling at Sandford Meisner's Neighborhood
Playhouse in New York. He appeared in several Broadway plays,
including ``Stalag 17,'' playing the role that won William Holden
an Oscar in the film version.
   After two years of Army service, he returned to New York, then
joined John Frankenheimer as dialogue coach on the film ``The Young
Savages.'' That led to TV directing, then his first feature, ``The
Slender Thread,'' starring Sidney Poitier and Anne Bancroft in
1965.
   His other films have included ``They Shoot Horses, Don't They?''
``Absence of Malice'' and ``Tootsie.''
   Pollack, 56, recently talked about his relationship with Redford
and other matters in an interview with The Associated Press. Here
are the highlights:
   Q. It's been five years since ``Out of Africa.'' Why such a gap
between films?
   A. I had often threatened to set up a production company, so I
went off and did it. I had always heard people say it takes so long
to get pictures done. I found out. It took me three years to set up
the company (Mirage). We did `Presumed Innocent,' `Major League,'
`The Fabulous Baker Boys' and `White Palace.'
   I didn't start looking for my own project for at least a couple
of years. Then I dug up `Havana,' which I had started working on in
1976. I didn't take the time to hunt around. I just remembered
liking it ... and putting it away. Q. What was so intriguing about
that period in Havana?
   A. Mostly it was romanticism ... the most sensual place in the
world in the '50s, as corrupt as any place in the world. There was
this wonderful - in terms of filmmaking - week of Christmas 1958
when the guns were in the hills and the gambling was at a fever
pitch. The vividness of the colors and the sensuality was like
catnip for a filmmaker.
   Q. Did you visit Havana yourself?
   A. Many times. But they (the U.S. government) just wouldn't let
me shoot there. As long as you're invited and you don't spend
money, you can go there. You're just not allowed to spend money
because that's called ``trading with the enemy.'' Since Cuba is our
enemy, they wouldn't let me spend millions of stockholders' money
down there. (Havana was re-created in the Dominican Republic at an
extra cost of $12 million to $14 million.)
   Q. How did you persuade Redford to abandon his causes and skiing
and make another movie?
   A. Well, I bought a lot of good groceries, because he likes to
eat. He knows I cook pretty well, and I just waved the smells and
got him in.
   No, I think he welcomed the challenge of stretching a bit. It's
a sleazier, lower-class character than he usually plays. This guy's
a little more vulnerable. He's the person who does the pursuing
instead of the one who lays back and is the object of pursuit. He's
roughed up a little bit, with a tattoo, he's got some mileage on
him now. All of that certainly was good for me, and I think it was
for him, too.
   Q. What about Lena Olin, his co-star?
   A. Lena was one of the most impressive of the newer actresses I
had seen. I needed somebody I thought could knock the pins out from
under Redford and make him drive after her through a war even
though she was rebuffing him. Also she had some substance beyond
sexuality, which is not uncommon among pretty women.
   Q. After seven pictures with Redford, can you work in shorthand?
   A. It's pretty minimal, what's required now. Sometimes I don't
even say anything. If a take of his close-up is cut and I say ``One
more,'' I don't need to say more. He just knows to try something
different.
   After seven pictures and 25 years, it is a shorthand. That
doesn't mean that we don't get into fights and arguments and beefs
and I don't sometimes have to push him like hell. There are always
areas that we disagree on, but he's very good about trying things,
whether he agrees or not.
   Q. How would you answer people who say ``Havana'' is a
pro-Castro movie?
   A. It's not pro-Castro. It's anti-Batista (the previous
dictator). If that means that de facto it's pro-Castro, then I have
to live with that. ... It's a movie that's saying quite clearly
that there was a degree of corruption in 1958 by the Batista
government that every American acknowledged, including the American
government.

<HEAD>How the Clean Air Law Will Affect One American City</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Car inspections will cost about $15 a
year more, gas stations will need vapor-catching pumps, and more
than 90 local companies - from paper mills to hospitals - will be
required to pay up to $100,000 annually under the nation's tough
new clean air law.
   That's just some of the impact of the Clean Air Act on Portland,
the home of the law's chief architect, Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell.
   Because Portland, like so many other cities, struggles with an
ozone problem and factory pollutants, it serves as a good example
of how the act will affect cities across the country.
   While the Environmental Protection Agency prepares regulations
under the sweeping legislation, state and local officials,
factories and businesses already are assessing the impact.
   ``This is a very aggressive act,'' said Dennis Keschl, director
of the bureau of air quality control in Maine's Department of
Environmental Protection. ``There are a lot of interesting
provisions, and we haven't found them all.''
   As in several towns and cities in Maine, the pungent smell of a
paper mill - a sharp odor not unlike cooking cabbage - often wafts
over the Portland area.
   The paper industry is just one of many that will be hit by the
law's stricter enforcement measures, regulations on releasing toxic
chemicals and higher fees for state permits allowing them to
pollute the air, Keschl said.
   The new law authorizes states to begin charging factories and
other polluters an annual fee of $25 for every ton of a pollutant
they put into the atmosphere up to 4,000 tons, or a maximum of
$100,000, Keschl said.
   In Cumberland County alone, he said, 92 companies will have to
pay some amount of the new fee, from the S.D. Warren paper mill in
Westbrook to Maine Medical Center in Portland.
   ``Remember, they're being charged per ton of pollutants, so
there's an incentive to reduce the amount they pollute,'' Keschl
said.
   Mitchell, a Democrat who lives in Portland when he's not in
Washington, said the law's major effect on his hometown will be to
reduce pollution from cars and trucks.
   Portland is one of more than 50 cities across the country where
drivers will have to get their cars inspected to make sure
pollution control devices work properly.
   State officials estimate the requirement will increase the cost
of a driver's annual safety inspection by $15, Keschl said.
   The new law also will require many gas stations in Portland and
other cities with an ozone-pollution problem to install a new type
of pump with a dual-hose nozzle designed to keep vapors from
escaping when a car is refueled.
   ``This is important to reduce not only volatile organic
compounds, but human exposure to benzene, which is a component of
gasoline and is known to be a carcinogen in humans,'' Mitchell
said.
   Gene Guilford, president of the Maine Oil Dealers Association,
estimated 100 service stations in the Portland area would have to
install the new pumps, at a cost of $30,000 per station.
   ``Ultimately, I would guess that companies will try to pass on
as much of the cost to the consumer as possible,'' he said.
   The changes won't have to be made for two to three years, Keschl
noted. The act gives the EPA one year to write regulations for
enforcing the law; states then have two years to institute the
regulations.
   The law is so new, so complex and so long - the final
legislation totaled more than 1,100 pages - that officials in Maine
and even Washington aren't certain of all its effects.
   ``We've got lawyers struggling over it right now, trying to
figure it out,'' said Dave Ryan, an EPA spokesman in Washington.
``It's going to generate hundreds of regulations between now and
the turn of the century.''
   The act imposes strict measures to combat acid rain, smog and
toxic industrial pollution, and has generated stiff opposition from
industries nationwide, Ryan said.
   ``All I've been enduring for the past several weeks is
criticism,'' he said.
   A major section takes aim at ozone, the most pervasive air
pollutant in Maine. It's created by the chemical reaction that
takes place when sunlight hits pollutants in the atmosphere.
   ``A large part of the problem we face comes in from states
upwind of us - New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts,'' Keschl said.
   Under the law, state environmental officials must work to ensure
that ozone levels don't go higher than the federal limit of .12
parts per million.
   Maine already has a stricter limit of .08 parts per million, but
Portland's ozone levels are nearly double that at .156 ppm, Keschl
said.
   As a result, ozone pollution in the Portland metropolitan area
is ranked ``moderate'' by the EPA. Ryan, the EPA spokesman, said 31
other metro areas in the country have a moderate pollution ranking.
   The Portsmouth-Dover-Rochester metropolitan area along the
Maine-New Hampshire border has a ``serious'' rating, the highest in
Maine, Keschl said. Fifteen other metro areas in the country have
serious ratings, eight have ``severe'' ratings and one, Los
Angeles, is in a class by itself - ``extreme,'' Ryan said.
   The primary contributors to the creation of ozone are nitrogen
oxides and volatile organic compounds, both of which come from auto
pollution.
   The law also lists 189 pollutants considered toxic. Companies
that release these chemicals are required to install the ``maximum
available'' pollution control devices to reduce the emissions.
   Though environmental officials haven't yet determined all of the
law's effects, Mitchell said it definitely will improve the
environment.
   ``The end result, we hope, will be cleaner air,'' he said.

   ``It must have been four or five times I shouted to Marie, `Are
you all right?' But then, suddenly, her voice changed, she sounded
different. She held my hand tightly, and gripped me as hard as she
could. She said, `Daddy, I love you very much.' Those were her
exact words to me, and those were the last words I ever heard her
say.'' - Gordon Wilson.

<DATELINE>CLARINBRIDGE, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When his 20-year-old daughter was
slain by a bomb, Gordon Wilson stood out from the conflict between
Protestants and Roman Catholics in Northern Ireland by simply
stating Christian beliefs.
   ``I bear no ill will. I bear no grudge,'' Wilson said hours
after an Irish Republican Army bomb killed his daughter Marie and
10 of his neighbors three years ago in Enniskillen.
   ``It's part of a greater plan, and God is good,'' Wilson told a
BBC reporter. ``And we shall meet again.''
   Wilson's message, so unexpected where rage and vows of vengeance
are commonplace, provoked an extraordinary reaction. Queen
Elizabeth II mentioned him in her Christmas speech. Organizations
pressed awards on him.
   ``I'm not sure why what I said should have had the response that
it did, because to me what I said was said from the heart,'' Wilson
said recently.
   ``I'm now talking about forgiveness. I've said the Lord's Prayer
all my life.
   ``Don't misunderstand me; I'm not pretending that I'm a
`religious' man. I'm not. But I do believe what I read when I see
the words, `Love God and love your neighbor.' That's what I was
taught, and that's what I have tried to live with all my life.
   ``And I would have thought that was a perfectly normal and
natural thing for a guy to say who himself believed, `forgive us
our trespasses as we forgive those ...'''
   Wilson reflects on his loss and his unwanted fame in a recently
published book, ``Marie: A Story from Enniskillen,'' written with
Alf McCreary.
   The slender book, just 122 pages, testifies to a deep vein of
decency and compassion that thrives in Northern Ireland despite
centuries of antagonism between Protestants and Catholics.
   Eleven people died in the Enniskillen bombing on Nov. 8, 1987,
and 63 were wounded. One of the wounded, school headmaster Ronnie
Hill, is still in a coma.
   All the dead were Protestants, but Wilson, a Methodist, writes
that the local Catholic priest was the first to comfort him in the
hospital.
   When Catholics held a memorial service, Wilson thought he should
go, and found he was not the only Protestant there.
   Yet, ``Afterwards I took a bit of `stick' for going,'' he wrote.
``A minority of people felt that I had sold out my `Protestant
heritage' by going into a Roman Catholic Church at all.''
   Te bombing at Enniskillen was especially shocking because the
victims were attending the annual Remembrance Day ceremonies
honoring the dead of the world wars.
   It was the worst of the IRA's many ``mistakes,'' and provoked a
debate among the guerrillas' supporters. For a time, there was hope
that Enniskillen would shock the IRA into abandoning violence.
   That hope faded as the gunmen of both sides claimed more
victims. A day before Wilson met a reporter to talk about the book,
the IRA kidnapped a Catholic and forced him to drive a van filled
with explosives into a military checkpoint. He and four soldiers
were killed.
   Wilson insists that hope survives, ``perhaps because I dare not
think otherwise.''
   He takes particular pride in the ``Spirit of Enniskillen''
program, supported by the British government and the American Fund
for Ireland, which provides funds for young people to go abroad and
gain a new perspective on their homeland.
   ``I have met some great kids, and that gives me hope,'' said
Wilson, who had stopped overnight in Clarinbridge, near Galway in
western Ireland, en route to a book-signing in Limerick.
   A tall, skinny man with a direct gaze, he has a manner of saying
exactly what he means, without qualification or evasion. He speaks
feelingly about his daughter's death and also takes a businessman's
interest in the details of book promotion.
   Politics, he said, he leaves to others.
   ``It is a very fine line between, on the one hand, talking about
reconciliation and tolerance and forgiveness, and getting into
politics and talking about religious denominations and
differences,'' he said.
   ``You wouldn't believe the number of things I was asked to do.
Thankfully, I was able to say, and I think wisely, `No thank
you'.''
   One rejected offer, he said in the book, was from a theatrical
agent in New York who told a mutual friend, ``Does this guy Wilson
realize he is sitting on a million bucks?''
   Wilson said he intended the book as a memorial to his daughter
and as the story of one family caught in Northern Ireland's
violence, but he also did it as therapy for himself.
   He said his wife, Joan, ``would be the first to say that I have
been a different and a better man since the book was finished. She
would say I'm in better form, with less sorrow in myself. Easier to
live with, perhaps, too.''
   A friend warned him soon after the bombing that he would wonder
why the tragedy had happened, and advised him to be wary of
answers.
   ``I still ask why, and I don't have the answer,'' he said.
   ``I do know that my 20-year-old daughter died in a bomb in
Enniskillen, with her whole life in front of her. And a guy like
me, 60 years of age as I was then, who had had `a good innings' as
we say, I'm still here.
   ``And I don't think I have any right to ask why. But I still do.
I still do.''

   As Christmas approaches, some Americans are
wondering whether they have more in common with the persecuted band
of Christ's early followers than with their ancestors who founded
the nation ``for ye glories of God.'' The first of a four-part
series, ``Unholy Wars: Religion in Public Life,'' examines
religion's changing role in our society.

   Prayer in school, creches in front of government buildings and
invocations at public ceremonies are out. A television network
promotes its most popular show with a scene mocking a family saying
grace: ``Dear God, we pay for all this stuff ourselves so thanks
for nothing'' is Bart Simpson's punchline.
   Today, government funds are used to support an art exhibition
that includes a crucifix soaked in a jar of urine, and United Way
funding is temporarily withdrawn from a Boy Scout chapter after
objections to the scouts' oath to do their duty ``to God and my
country.''
   A generation of revolutionary change in the role of religion in
public life has left many Americans reeling, and the nation
struggling to find a common ethical ground to solve divisive moral
issues such as abortion, drugs, homelessness, poverty and the
possibility of war.
   ``For all kinds of good reasons, we have systematically excluded
the church from our public life. Now we discover that the voice of
conscience which we always depended on - the church - is not
present in the public debate,'' said Lisa Newton, a philosopher at
Fairfield University who wrote the study guide for the Public
Broadcasting Service's 10-part series on ethics in America.
   ``So the question that confronts us now is, given the
constraints of the separation of church and state, how do we
re-empower the churches?''
   Only 39 percent of the respondents to a Associated Press poll
conducted in November by ICR Survey Research Group said they
believed religion is increasing its influence in American life. In
a 1985 Gallup Poll, 49 percent said religion was increasing in
influence. And in 1957, a Gallup Poll indicated that more than
two-thirds thought religion was gaining power.
   In 1986, after 12 years standing alone as the nation's most
trusted institution, religion was replaced by the military as the
institution in which Americans have the most confidence, according
to another Gallup Poll.
   But contrary to some expectations, religious groups are not
going quietly into that good night of a secular age.
   Born-again Christian evangelicals who burst onto the American
political scene in the mid-1970s have shown no sign of withdrawing.
And groups such as Catholics, Jews, black churches and now Muslims,
alarmed by a rising tide of indifference to social ills from racism
to drug abuse, have entered into public policy debates in dramatic
fashion.
   ``As I travel around the country, I find a lot of very
reasonable, rational people who feel under siege,'' said Gary
Bauer, a former domestic policy adviser to Ronald Reagan who now is
director of the Family Research Council, perhaps the most powerful
evangelical lobbying group in the nation.
   ``Their perception is that they're living in a hostile country,
that everything they believe in is under persistent attack.''
   When the Pilgrims founded this country, they could not have
foreseen a culture that celebrates a crucifix-adorned woman named
Madonna who capitalizes on religious imagery with songs such as the
none-too-subtle ``Like A Virgin'' and the title of her latest
anthology, ``The Immaculate Collection.''
   The purpose they declared in 1620 in the Mayflower Compact:
``For ye glories of God, and advancement of ye Christian faith.''
   The public manifestations of religion at the core of American
life stayed with society from the American Revolution, when all but
one of the 13 states had a tax to support the preaching of the
Gospel, to the 1950s, when national values that mainline
Protestantism supplied were reinforced by billboards along the
nation's highways encouraging Americans to go to church.
   ``That was kind of a final burst of a dream of the Protestant
America where the churches continued to enjoy a great deal of
influence and authority,'' said Dean Thomas Ogletree of Yale
Divinity School.
   While the percentage of Catholics in America has jumped 40
percent since 1947, the percentage of Protestants declined 23
percent.
   Within Protestantism, churches such as the Southern Baptist
Convention and the Assemblies of God grew rapidly, while the
denominations that used to hold cultural sway, such as the
Presbyterian and Episcopal churches, declined dramatically.
   Some sociologists expect Islam to surpass Judaism as the
nation's largest minority religion by the end of the century,
behind Christianity.
   Judicial rulings keep pushing the walls separating religion and
public life farther apart, and an increasingly secular education
system is shutting out any reference to religion, said A. James
Reichley, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and author
of ``Religion in American Public Life.''
   At the same time, Reichley said, society is getting more of its
direction from other institutions, such as television.
   ``The actual influence of the churches and religion in shaping a
public ethic is continuing to decline,'' he said.
   William McKinney, dean of Hartford Seminary and co-author of
``American Mainline Religion: Its Changing Shape and Future,'' uses
baseball imagery to trace the changes.
   The early Protestant groups built the stadium and supplied the
teams, he said. In the Federal period in the late 18th century,
they were forced to admit other teams. By the 1920s, other teams
had their own stadiums, but mainline Protestant churches still
supplied the umpires.
   ``What's happened in the last 30 years is the umpires are gone
and nobody knows what the rules are,'' McKinney said.
   Many religious leaders praise the new religious pluralism in a
nation that has a history of religious bigotry - represented by the
period in the early 19th century when the Nativist Movement fueled
the burning of Catholic churches and convents, and the virulent
anti-Semitism in the latter part of the century in reaction to the
rise in Jewish immigration.
   ``The difference (today) is that the various religious
traditions get expressed, and no one group has the power or will
have the power to force its view on others,'' McKinney said.
   Religious groups working in coalitions have enjoyed some
political successes. Catholics and evangelicals have helped sustain
the abortion issue, and mainline Protestant and Catholic groups
receive credit for focusing attention on human rights abuses and
helping keep the nation out of direct military involvement in El
Salvador and Nicaragua during the Reagan years.
   But some religious observers say the struggle of competing
secular and religious voices has left society with no common
language to mediate moral conflicts.
   Concern for the common good is giving way to ``just pure
selfishness,'' with an accompanying rise in ethnic and racial
tensions, including anti-Semitism, Reichley said.
   What some now fear is that if religion is reduced to the
periphery of American society, ethical debates will be reduced to a
Darwininan struggle of special interest groups, where power, not
morality, rules.
   ``Political scientists don't want to talk about the Good
Society,'' but instead confine their discussion to analyses of
voter preferences, Ogletree said.

You say, `Will the public accept it?' ''
   The Reign of Terror, the French Revolution period when motives
of revenge and power overwhelmed reason and many people were
summarily executed as counterrevolutionaries, is among the
historical lessons demonstrating why religion is necessary to
American democracy, said Rabbi Alexander Schindler, president of
the Union of American Hebrew Congregations.
   ``Reason has been dethroned from its pedestal as the saving
grace of humankind,'' Schindler said. ``Ethics without religion is
like a cut flower. Because it has no roots, it cannot sustain
itself. Above all, it cannot reproduce itself.''

<HEAD>How AP Poll on Religion Was Conducted</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Unholy Wars I</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Associated Press poll on religion was
conducted by telephone Nov. 16-20 among a random sample of 1,006
adults in the contiguous United States. Interviewing was done by
ICR Survey Research Group of Media, Pa.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a three-point margin of sampling error,
meaning that 19 of 20 times its findings should be within three
points of the result if every adult American were asked the same
questions. The error margin is larger for subgroups.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions.
   Here is how the questions related to this story were phrased;
because of rounding, sums may not total 100:
   - At the present time, do you think religion as a whole is
increasing its influence in American life or losing its influence?
Increasing its influence: 39 percent. Losing its influence: 52
percent. Don't know or no answer: 10 percent.
   - The federal government funds artists and art exhibitions. Some
artists took this money and produced works that people said
offended their religious beliefs. Should the government refuse to
fund such artists or not? Yes, should refuse: 35 percent. No,
should not refuse: 53 percent. DK-NA: 12 percent.
   - The Boy Scouts take an oath ``to do my duty to God and my
country.'' The Scout organization says it does not discriminate on
the basis of religion, but some people say the oath keeps out
non-believers. Do you think the Boy Scouts should drop the
reference to God from their oath? Yes, should drop the reference to
God: 11 percent. No: 83 percent. DK-NA: 6 percent.
   The people polled were asked, ``What is your religion?'' If they
said Protestant, Congregational, Episcopalian, Lutheran, Methodist,
Presbyterian or United Church of Christ, they were categorized as
mainline Protestant. The evangelical category comprised 10 other
responses, including Baptist, Church of God and Pentecostal.

   Presiding Bishop Edmond Browning couldn't get his phone calls
returned when Ronald Reagan was president. Now, with fellow
Episcopalian George Bush in office, Browning considers himself a
pastor to the president.
   But while presidential access is improving for mainline
Protestants, some disgruntled religious conservatives are slamming
the White House door on their way out. They contend Bush took their
votes and then pushed aside their concerns on abortion,
homosexuality and obscenity.
   Describing a meeting with Bush in late October, Robert Dugan,
public affairs director of the National Association of
Evangelicals, said, ``We told him the truth - that his
administration is on the ropes with evangelicals.''
   Welcome to the new world of religion and politics.
   Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson have stepped out of the
political limelight. Mainline Protestant churches see signs of a
return to political influence. And the Catholic Church may emerge
as the most powerful religious power broker of all, because of its
willingness to enter into coalitions with a wide range of allies.
   An Associated Press poll conducted in November by ICR Survey
Research Group indicates Americans believe that, within some
limits, religious leaders have a responsibility to enter public
policy debates.
   Three-quarters of the poll respondents said religious leaders
such as priests, ministers and rabbis should speak out on social
issues. But 58 percent, including 63 percent of the Catholic
respondents, said the clergy should not endorse political
candidates.
   The emergence of issues such as abortion, civil rights, child
care and federal funding of the arts into the forefront of national
public policy debates has shown that no American religious group
appears willing to give up the ``good'' fight.
   ``Perhaps the single most dramatic defeat of the forces of
militant secularism in America is that almost 18 years after Roe
vs. Wade, the abortion issue just hasn't gone away,'' said Richard
Neuhaus, author of ``The Naked Public Square'' and the director of
the Institute on Religion and Public Life in New York.
   In the new ballgame, the ability to deliver votes, not past
status as the religious elite, is what counts.
   The heyday of mainline Protestantism, highlighted when President
Eisenhower laid the cornerstone for the new National Council of
Churches building in New York in 1958, declined two years later,
coinciding with the election of the country's first Catholic
president - John Kennedy.
   Born-again Christian evangelicals, jolted from political apathy
by judicial rulings eliminating school prayer and legalizing
abortion, entered the fray.
   Leaders such as Falwell and Robertson helped mobilize voter
registration drives that drew millions into the political process
and contributed heavily to Reagan's two presidential victories. In
1988, Dugan said, Bush received 82 percent of the white evangelical
vote, his largest single voting bloc.
   But as Robertson and Falwell left the political spotlight to
concentrate on less earthly matters, some say evangelicals'
influence has waned.
   ``The well is dry for now,'' said Barry Lynn, legislative
director of the American Civil Liberties Union, a frequent opponent
of religious conservatives on church-state issues.
   Others, including University of Chicago historian Martin Marty,
say the ``superstars'' such as Falwell and Robertson have been
replaced by new leaders like radio psychologist and author James
Dobson, whose Family Research Council has chapters in 17 states
lobbying on issues such as abortion, home schooling and
pornography.
   The arrest of a Florida record store owner and two 2 Live Crew
members grew from a Focus on the Family mailing containing the
lyrics of the group's explicit rap album ``As Nasty as They Wanna
Be.''
   Upset with the Republican Party's apparent wavering on its
anti-abortion stance and the lack of concern expressed by Bush over
the National Endowments for the Arts controversy, evangelicals may
be looking for new political partners.
   ``If the president and the party don't wake up, they face the
possibility of a third party in 1992 that would end up giving the
White House to the Democrats,'' said Gary Bauer, a former domestic
policy adviser under Reagan who now oversees the Family Research
Council. ``These people are up for grabs in a major way.''
   Mainline churches have shown their political influence by
helping focus attention on human rights abuses in El Salvador and
working for congressional passage of the Civil Rights Restoration
Act, said Browning, the Episcopal bishop.
   But other observers say those churches are hurt by their
inability to mobilize grass-roots support among their
congregations.
   Alan D. Hertzke, the author of ``Representing God in
Washington,'' said liberal churches have been effective in lobbying
for funds for hunger relief and in limiting aid to the Nicaraguan
Contras but that some members of Congress discount their influence.
   ``There's pretty good evidence that most church members have no
knowledge of what their national church leaders are doing,'' said
Hertzke, a professor at the University of Oklahoma.
   Despite its absolute theological stance on many issues, the
Catholic Church has proven to be one of the most effective
religious players in the game of practical politics, Hertzke said.
   For example, he said, Catholics took the lead among religious
groups in the abortion debate in Pennsylvania and forsook an
``all-or-nothing'' approach to work successfully for a law
requiring a waiting period, for the woman's husband to be notified
and for parental consent to be required for minors.
   Catholic lobbyists also helped open the door for aid to
parochial schools by working for a child care bill that allows
church-run day care centers to be eligible for federal subsidies.
   But what may hurt the church's sway, some observers say, are
high-profile disciplinary actions such as the banning of one
legislator from the Communion rail and threatening others with
eternal damnation for their abortion-rights stands.
   Demoralization within the church over the clergy shortage and
internal liberal-conservative tensions also limit its influence,
said Marty, the University of Chicago historian.
   ``They're power brokers, but they're not all that powerful.
They're divided,'' he said.
   As the nation prepares for the possibility of war in the Middle
East, James Childress, a University of Virginia professor and
author of ``Moral Responsibility in Conflicts,'' is among those who
fear religious groups aren't doing enough to hold the nation
accountable to its ``just-war'' tradition requiring war to be
justified in moral rather than economic terms.
   ``There's been fairly ready acceptance of the definition of our
national interest in this setting,'' Childress said.
   If America enters a war with Iraq, Childress said, it appears a
majority of religious groups would support the administration.
   Others say that would be a serious miscalculation.
   The National Council of Churches has urged the administration to
halt its military buildup in the Persian Gulf and begin withdrawing
troops, and the National Conference of Catholic Bishops has
repeatedly expressed reservations about the possibility of a U.S.
offensive.
   ``We ignore the religious element to our peril,'' said Bishop
Herbert Chilstrom, spiritual leader of the Evangelical Lutheran
Church in America. ``There is a profound sense of religious belief
in our people.''

adults in the contiguous United States. Interviewing was done by
ICR Survey Research Group of Media, Pa.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a three-point margin of sampling error,
meaning that 19 of 20 times its findings should be within three
points of the result if every adult American were asked the same
questions. The error margin is larger for subgroups.
   There are other sources of poential error in polls, including

because of rounding, sums may not total 100:
   - Is it all right for religious leaders, such as priests,
ministers and rabbis, to speak out on social issues? Yes: 75
percent. No: 20 percent. Don't know or No answer: 6 percent.
   - Is it all right for religious leaders, such as priests,
ministers and rabbis, to endorse political candidates? Yes: 34
percent. No: 58 percent. DK-NA: 8 percent.
   The people polled were asked, ``What is your religion?'' If they
said Protestant, Congregational, Episcopalian, Lutheran, Methodist,
Presbyterian or United Church of Christ, they were categorized as
mainline Protestant. The evangelical category comprised 10 other
responses, including Baptist, Church of God and Pentecostal.

   Liberal-conservative barricades within the
nation's churches have limited religious groups' ability to help
Americans develop a common ground to discuss moral issues. The

Public Life,'' examines the consequences.

   Religion in America was simpler in the 1950s.
   The phrase ``under God'' was added to the Pledge of Allegiance,
Catholics, evangelicals, Jews and Muslims kept a low profile, and a
pecking order helped a community's most prominent citizens
gravitate toward mainline Protestant institutions such as the
Presbyterian and Episcopal churches.
   But then a series of sociological changes shook nearly 3{
centuries of Protestant hegemony, ranging from the rapid rise of
evangelicalism, to the surge of Catholics to equal Protestants in
income and education, to judicial rulings limiting the influence of
religion in public life.
   In explaining what happened in his Midwest community, one
mainline Protestant executive told Hartford Seminary Dean William
McKinney, ``You have to understand the neighborhood changed when
the whites moved out and the Irish Catholics moved in.''
   The demographic shifts have not led to a passive changing of the
guard, but to what some observers see as increasingly bitter
divisions between liberals and conservatives that threaten
religion's traditional role of supplying society with a common set
of moral standards.
   ``Religious people have got to get their act together,'' said
Dean Thomas Ogletree of Yale Divinity School. ``If we're unable to
talk to one another because we're so divided, the larger society is
wise to say, `Let's keep religion out of it because they'll just
mess it up.' ''
   In a 1984 Gallup Poll, 31 percent of religious conservatives
held negative stereotypes of religious liberals, while only 7
percent found similar faults with themselves. The range of
intolerance was even greater on the religious left, where 41
percent held negative views of conservatives, while only 3 percent
said liberal sterotypes were valid.
   ``The division is at least as strong, if not stronger than it
was five years ago,'' said Robert Wuthnow, a Princeton University
sociology professor who has studied the issue.
   America may be heralded as a haven for religious freedom, but it
also has a history of religious bigotry.
   At the founding of the country, most states had laws
discriminating against Catholics and formally establishing either
Anglican or Congregational churches.
   Strong anti-Catholic and anti-Semitic attitudes existed into the
1950s, despite a veneer of placid tolerance epitomized by President
Eisenhower's declaration that, ``Our government makes no sense
unless it is founded on a deeply felt religious faith - and I don't
care what it is.''
   But the '60s and '70s saw unprecedented ecumenical advances,
fueled by such things as a broad range of religious groups working
together on the civil rights movement, Pope John XXIII opening the
windows of the Catholic Church to the world with the Second Vatican
Council, and a series of theological statements from Christian
groups apologizing for their past anti-Semitism.
   ``I think if you look at any long time line, the trend is only
up,'' said Jacqueline Wexler, president of the National Conference
of Christians and Jews.
   But many observers say the resurgence of Catholics and
born-again Christian evangelicals into the public arena has brought
about a renewal of religious prejudice.
   Thirty percent of the respondents in a Gallup survey last year
said they would not welcome religious fundamentalists as neighbors.
By comparison, only 5 percent said they would not welcome
Protestants in general or Jews.
   At a Reformation Day service in October at Yale Divinity School,
Lutheran theologian George Lindbeck lamented that anti-Catholicism
has become in some corners ``the anti-Semitism of intellectuals.''
   McKinney, who is studying mainline Protestant executives and who
authored ``American Mainline Religion: Its Changing Shape and
Future,'' agreed.
   ``I think anti-Catholicism is the last respectable American
prejudice,'' he said.
   The liberal-conservative barricades cross denominational lines.
Many religious conservatives, who tend to emphasize spirituality,
prayer and Bible study over social concerns, have begun to form
their own organizations within mainline churches. The Good News
movement in the United Methodist Church, the Presbyterian Lay
Committee and the Episcopal Synod of America are examples.
   In more conservative denominations such as the Southern Baptist
Convention, those who favor greater acceptance of divergent
theological views also have formed their own lobbying groups, such
as the Southern Baptist Alliance.
   But the liberal-conservative divide may not be as wide as each
side might think.
   Wuthnow said his research indicates conservatives are more
tolerant and socially concerned than liberals think they are; some
conservative churches, for example, have established programs to
help the homeless and counsel the unemployed.
   In the Brookings Institution study ``Religion in American Public
Life,'' A. James Reichley said many religious conservatives
approach the abortion struggle with the same ardor liberals fought
for civil rights.
   ``On the issue of abortion, they believe it is the liberals who
are countenancing mass destruction of potential life, while
fundamentalists, in alliance with Catholics, stand up for the most
vulnerable of all forms of human life - the unborn,'' Reichley
said.
   At the same time, Wuthnow said, liberals are more devout in
their faith than conservatives think they are, as shown by a
renewed interest in evangelism and Bible study.
   Bishop Herbert W. Chilstrom, spiritual leader of the Evangelical
Lutheran Church in America, said more than 9,000 of the
denomination's 11,000 congregations ordered tapes of a
church-sponsored faith-development program.
   ``That's indicative of a very deep hunger for faith development
among our people,'' he said.
   And partnerships are being fostered. For the first time in a
generation, religious groups across the board now are forming
coalitions on issues ranging from apartheid to pornography.
   ``Many religious leaders have a sense of being in the same boat.
They sense, as they once did not, the danger of religion being
ttally driven out of a public role in society,'' Reichley said.
   Pressure has grown in recent years to consider issues ranging
from abortion to nuclear war on secular grounds, as more people
view religion as a set of divisive, sectarian interests, Wuthnow
said.
   When you take out the moral values supplied by religion, he
said, ``Then what becomes important are issues of economics,
political expediency, practicality.''
   Those are the wrong guidelines to use for deciding issues such
as euthanasia, genetic engineering, allocation of limited health
care resources and even whether the nation should go to war,
Wuthnow and others said.
   In the new religious climate, the ability to compromise is seen
as a high moral value, said Ogletree, of Yale Divinity School.
   ``The alternative to compromise is moral anarchy or religious
conflict,'' he said.

   Juan Arreola crouched over a makeshift grill
beneath an interstate bridge, heating his supper of corn tortilla
and chile peppers.
   ``We are the poorest of all the workers, and that's why we are
here,'' Arreola says of the chile pickers who sleep under the
bridge they call ``Hotel Mira Estrellas,'' or ``The Hotel Star
Gazer.''
   He and the others can't afford the $2 a night for the
alternative, Arreola says, a soiled pad atop a metal frame in a
dingy laborer's barracks, where one toilet and sink must suffice
for 20 workers.
   Farm workers in the chile fields of New Mexico have demanded an
end to what they call exploitation. Growers say the pickers'
allegations unfairly tarnish all of them for the transgressions of
a few.
   But recent federal investigations support the complaints of the
pickers, who disrupted this year's multimillion-dollar harvest with
protests, strikes and demonstrations over substandard living
conditions and poverty-level wages.
   A backyard garden vegetable 15 years ago, chile peppers now are
New Mexico's largest cash food crop, and the state is the nation's
largest chile producer and exporter. Last year's crop was valued at
nearly $42 million.
   But some workers, who won legal status through a 1986
immigration amnesty program, say they haven't shared in the
prosperity.
   ``They think it's a lot of money they're paying us,'' said Jesus
Vasquez of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, who has been living beneath the
bridge since May. ``But it's not enough.''
   Carlos Marentes, director of the Union de Trabajadores Agricolas
Fronterrizas, the border agricultural workers' union, said farm
workers earn an average of $6,000 for a family of seven, $12,000
less than the federal poverty line.
   Although federal law requires farmers to pay laborers the
minimum wage of $3.80 an hour, pickers are being paid the same
rates for a bucket of peppers as they were a decade ago, he said.
Meanwhile, the size of the bucket has gone from 6 gallons to 10
gallons.
   Farmers pay by the bucket picked, an average 60 cents to 70
cents. Even if a worker does not pick enough buckets to earn
$30.40, the minimum wage for an eight-hour day, farmers or labor
contractors are required by law to pay the hourly wage anyway.
   Union organizers and some pickers say farmers aren't complying.
   ``I have a wage receipt from a lady who worked ... eight hours,
and they have four hours on her work receipt. She made $21,'' said
Sandy New-Lopez, a union staff member.
   ``I think what they want is, they want the undocumented workers
they had before 1986 that would stay in the field all day and pick
for a few cents a bucket,'' Marentes said.
   Farmers believe the union has exaggerated the problems of a
minority of workers.
   ``I think they bring up isolated incidents,'' said Don Hackey,
chairman of the New Mexico Chile Commission, which represents many
of the state's estimated 400 chile growers. ``They find something
that's happened to an individual and then portray it as widespread
and say that's how we all work. That's absolutely not true.''
   Hackey said he pays 100 to 150 workers picking his 300 acres as
much as 80 cents a bucket. His own survey of workers on his field
found the average wage was $54 for about eight hours work.
   ``The only complaint I hear from my people is, `Gosh, I wish we
had this all year,' '' Hackey said.
   U.S. Labor Department investigators sent out in August found 63
cases of violations of various federal laws, said Andy Chavez,
district director of the Albuquerque Wage and Hour Division of the
Labor Department.
   A second investigation of 51 growers and farm labor contractors
that ended in October found 142 violations. Only six of the 51 were
in compliance with laws protecting farm workers, many of whom say
they were better off before they were granted amnesty.
   ``I thought it would be a lot better now that I am legal,'' said
Jose Cadena, 25, who was trying to sleep one night in a pickup
truck parked beneath an interstate bridge. ``But now it's a lot
worse. They used to give housing to the illegal aliens and food.
Now we have to pay for our own.''
   Tierra del Sol, a non-profit group that provides housing for
farm workers, estimated about 17,000 work in southern New Mexico.
Among them are permanent laborers who live in the towns where they
work, migratory workers who follow the crops, and a commuter
population that comes from Juarez and is recruited in El Paso,
Texas, about 90 miles from Hatch.
   On the same night Cadena was sleeping his camper, a few workers
huddled beneath flimsy blankets on an El Paso street, trying to get
a little sleep. Many workers sought shelter inside parked buses;
others paced the street to stay awake.
   Most of those workers can be found in pre-dawn hours at the foot
of the Paso del Norte Bridge in downtown El Paso, waiting for labor
contractors who will hire them for another day's work.
   Gregorio Lopez, 33, said he usually arrives at the bridge about
1 a.m. after catching a 10 p.m. bus from his home in Juarez. The
buses usually return him from the fields at about 6 p.m. or 7 p.m.
   ``All I have a chance to do is shower and eat and come back,''
he said. ``I sleep on the bus. I get about 1{ hours sleep.''
   Lopez said he didn't like to sleep on the street because workers
who do often awake to find their shoes, jacket or money stolen.
   ``More and more people are sleeping out on the street. They're
not street people, they are farm laborers,'' said Bill Belt,
regional administrator of the U.S. Department of Labor Wage and
Hour Division. ``These are good, hard-working people.
Unfortunately, they are caught in a bad situation.''
   Grower Eliseo Flores believes the producers are the ones with
the problems.
   ``We need some real help. What we got is a bunch of dadgum trash
that litter the town and litter the fields. We were better off with
wets (undocumented workers),'' said Flores, who farms 200 acres.
``These people, they go to the bathroom 20 times a day, or they go
in the fields. ... We got a bunch of winos and drug addicts.''
   Flores said he's been forced to knock down houses he set up for
workers because the structures were vandalized and didn't meet
federal standards.
   Hackey, the chile commission chairman, said farmers already pay
taxes and shouldn't have to subsidize housing for workers.
   Instead, he said, the commission supports Tierra del Sol, which
has built an apartment complex for laborers in Hatch and is trying
to build another in Anthony on the Texas-New Mexico state line.
   ``No one is really at fault for their situation,'' said Rose
Garcia, Tierra del Sol's executive director. ``Unfortunately,
because they are farm workers, they are the working homeless.''

   Some Scrooges say it's ``those little red and green things''
that make them think you'd have to be nuttier than a fruitcake to
eat one. Others drag out the joke. You know, the one about there
being just one fruitcake that gets passed around and around and
around.
   ``It's the only thing that everybody doesn't like, except
lutefisk,'' the humorist Calvin Trillin says, referring to a
Norwegian dried cod dish.
   But have you ever eaten fruitcake, Mr. Trillin?
   ``I think I had a bite once, 20 years ago. It was before I knew.
I was an innocent,'' he says. ``Probably it was Christmas, the fire
was going, the presents were being unwrapped, or maybe they already
were unwrapped.''
   Fruitcake has had its share of humiliation. Johnny Carson and
columnist Russell Baker have poked fun. Nearly a third of the
people surveyed by American Express a couple of years back said it
was the worst gift of all.
   Well, Mr. Trillin, Mr. Baker and all you other naysayers, enough
already.
   ``It's sort of an annual plague,'' said Susan Purdy, author of
the cookbook ``A Piece of Cake,'' who argues there's more to
fruitcake than men of this ilk know.
   ``I'm not going to sit here and tell you that when you hear a
fruitcake joke, it doesn't make you kind of mad. It does,'' said W.
Dale Parker, a vice president at the granddaddy of fruitcake
bakers, Claxton Bakery Inc. in Claxton, Ga.
   Parker's family business bakes 5 million pounds of fruitcake a
year.
   ``Obviously, there's a lot of people out there eating
fruitcake,'' Parker said.
   ``We get some rave reviews, that it's just like the one
grandmother wanted to bake but couldn't,'' boasts Father Andrew of
the Holy Cross Abbey in Berryville, Va., where each year the
Monastery Bakery turns out 13,000 traditional fruit- and
nut-studded cakes laced with brandy.
   So, Mr. Trillin, how do you suppose these companies stay in
business?
   People ``are buying them, and they're giving them to other
people. But that doesn't mean they're eating them,'' he said.
``I've been given a lot of fruitcakes as gifts.''
   Richard Sullivan of the Glace Fruit Processors admits some
fruitcakes taste like sawdust. His father always got one for
Christmas that was ``dense and bitter. I never liked the thing.''
   Ah, but then there are good ones.
   ``They have to have wonderful fruits,'' said Purdy, who uses
mangoes, papayas, apricots, dates, nuts, dried apples, pears and
plums. She advises: ``Avoid little red and green and yellow
things.''
   ``A good fruitcake to me is like eating candy,'' Sullivan said.
``I just love it.''
   Melvin Gordon, president of Paradise Fruit Inc. in Plant City,
Fla., said he doesn't know how fruitcake got such a lousy
reputation.
   He notes that his industry sells 50 million pounds of candied
fruit a year, and if he could talk to Mr. Trillin, he'd say:
``Fruitcake has been around a lot longer than you and I.''
   Even some particular fruitcakes can claim that.
   In ``Enough's Enough,'' a new collection of Trillin's columns,
he mentions a family in Michigan ``that brings out an antique
fruitcake every Christmas, a fruitcake that for some reason was not
eaten at Christmas dinner in 1895 and has symbolized the holidays
ever since.''
   Mr. Trillin, meet Morgan Ford of Tecumseh, Mich., keeper of a
cake baked not in 1895, he says, but in 1878 by his
great-grandmother.
   When she died early the following year, the cake was forgotten
for a while. Today, it's in an airtight glass box, Ford said.
``There's a musty rum smell there yet,'' he said.
   When his uncle, then 86, took a bite a couple decades back, Ford
said, ``He had to cut it off with his jacknife, sliver it off. It
doesn't look too appetizing to me.''
   As if to ward off the inevitable, Ford notes right away that his
uncle lived two more years.
   ``If I make it to 86 - and I'm 70 - I'll taste it then,'' he
said.
   But he could be persuaded to give into temptation by Johnny
Carson, who has poked fun at the cake. ``If he'd take a bite,''
Ford said, ``I'd take a bite.''
   Go ahead, Mr. Trillin, joke about ``heirloom'' or ``antique''
fruitcakes. Age can be a virtue.
   The late James Beard, often called the dean of American food,
once wrote that his mother baked fruitcakes a full year ahead, and
kept some of her wedding fruitcake for a quarter-century by
periodically lacing it with cognac.
   The ancient Romans, Purdy said, baked fruitcakes called
``satura,'' Latin for a ``full dish'' and the root of the word
satire (perhaps the Romans had one up on you, Mr. Trillin.).
   Martha Washington made one for family holidays. Before
refrigeration, the sugar and spirits in fruitcakes acted as
preservatives.
   As recently as 50 years ago, no one chortled over fruitcake.
   ``Our taste has changed. We don't like things that are too
heavy, too sweet,'' Purdy said. ``We're talking about an antique
cake in contemporary life, and it's trying to make the
transition.''
   So, go ahead, take your potshots, Mr. Trillin and Co. But,
honestly, wouldn't you be in a holiday funk if nobody at all
remembered you with a fruitcake?

   There are December nights when Beverly Nyberg,
who works all day, looks up from frosting ginger cookies and finds
it's 3 a.m.
   ``It's a mad rush. That's the essence of Christmas cookies,''
said Nyberg, a commercial artist at a New York advertising agency.
   Why do it, then? ``For tradition, for love,'' she said. Her
mother, now nearly 80, used to make at least 30 kinds of Christmas
cookies. Nyberg's 20-year-old son already is asking what kinds mom
is making this year.
   Her favorites are thumbprints, a sugar cookie covered with nuts
and rolled in a ball. A thumb stuck in the middle before baking
leaves a depression just right for frosting or jam.
   Throughout December, cooks everywhere take out traditional and
new-found recipes, baking nights and weekends to fill old shoe
boxes or tins with cookies, carefully layered with wax paper, to
freeze until Christmas.
   ``Yeah, your body complains'' from the effort, Nyberg said. But
the payoff is ``the enjoyment that everyone is walking by and
grabbing cookies off the plate when it comes to the D-day of
Christmas.''
   Food historian William Woys Weaver of Devon, Pa., said he tries
new cookies each year, but always returns to old favorites such as
a German cookie called chocolate apeas.
   ``I made some for some children last week and a little girl
said, `These even taste like Christmas.' I said, `Good, good,
that's just what I want to hear,' '' Weaver said.
   ``Nothing represents the spirit of loving, nurturing and giving
more than a homemade cookie,'' Rose Levy Beranbaum writes in her
new book, ``Rose's Christmas Cookies.''
   ``They're always exactly the right size, they look so appealing,
they taste so delicious; they're satisfying but not too filling,''
Judy Knipe and Barbara Marks write in ``The Christmas Cookie
Book.''
   In many homes, the morning before Christmas, the shoe boxes and
cookie tins come out and gift baskets are arranged for delivery
later that day. Little hands take delight in decorating cut-out
sugar cookies with sprinkles and red hots, some to be left that
night for Santa Claus.
   Marks will make eight or 10 kinds of cookies this year,
including ginger pecan slices, chocolate orange chunk cookies and
lemon drops, carrying on a tradition learned at the elbow of her
mother and other relatives. Especially her dad's Aunt Marie.
   ``I would get so exicted, and a month before Christmas I would
go over on Saturdays and bake with her,'' Marks said. ``Getting to
go somewhere all by yourself at 7 or 8 was really something.''
   Much of the year, home baking is something of a lost art. The
Nestle Toll House Kitchen in Purchase, N.Y., cites studies showing
tht only 35 percent of the baked goods eaten last year were made
at home. But nearly all the people surveyed said they bake for the
holidays, Nestle said.
   ``Cookie'' comes from the Dutch, koekje, the diminutive for
cake. But cookies are easier to make and more forgiving of the
novice's mistakes than cakes, Beranbaum said.
   Americans have always loved Christmas cookies, Weaver said.
Colonists could afford sweets only for special occasions. And while
Christmas cookies in the shapes of animals and people were made for
children, they appealed to everyone, he said.
   ``It was a release, a fantasy food in a sense. ... The adult
who's making camels and what have you, I think they're going back
to childhood a little, don't you?'' Weaver said. ``Of course, they
taste very good, too.''
   Among the earliest cookies were gingerbread, which came both
from Germany and from England and Scotland, Weaver writes in ``The
Christmas Cook.''
   By the late 19th century, refined sugar, eggs and flour were
available to most people, and the cast-iron stove gave homemakers
more control over baking than they had at the hearth, he said.
   That, combined with a wave of immigration, broadened the home
cook's repertoire, which now includes cookies from much of the
world, he said.
   In her Greenwich Village apartment, Beranbaum shows off what
look like stained glass windows: sugar cookies with intricate
cutouts, filled with crushed sour balls that become translucent
when baked. She also bakes exquisite, delicate snowflakes that
sparkle when hung from the branches of a lighted tree.
   Beranbaum's book has traditional, elegant cookies; down-home
green wreaths made with marshmallows and cornflakes; even brownies.
In ``The Christmas Cookie Book,'' the sharing is evident from the
many recipes with a name attached: Amy's molasses puffs, Renata's
vanilla crescents, Holly's ginger crisps.
   When Beranbaum worked in the test kitchen of the Ladies Home
Journal, her first story was on cookies, for the Christmas of 1975.
But Christmas has long been part of this Jewish New Yorker's life.
   ``I grew up with the feeling that in New York, Chistmas was a
joyous cultural celebration belonging to everyone and not
restricted only to those who observed it as a religious holiday,''
she writes.
   Because of her book, Beranbaum doesn't have time to bake cookies
for family and friends this year, but she likes one way of
considering her situation:
   Give a gift of Christmas cookies and you spruce up one holiday.
Give a book that teaches how to bake them and you feed Christmases
forever.

   Here are two Christmas cookie recipes:
   
   Lebkuchen, from ``The Christmas Cook,'' by William Woys Weaver
(Harper Perennial, $18.95)
   A traditional German Christmas cookie, large, thick and chewy.
   Yield: Approximately 7 dozen
   8} cups all-purpose flour
   2{ tablespoons baking soda
   1 tablespoon ground cloves
   1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
   1 tablespoon ground cardamom
   4 cups ground almonds
   { cup plus 2 tablespoons chopped citron
   2 cups plus 3 tablespoons honey
   2 cups plus 3 tablespoons unsulfured molasses
   4 tablespoons brandy
   
   Sift the flour, soda and spices together twice. Add the ground
almonds and citron. Mix the honey and molasses in a saucepan and
heat to a gentle boil. Remove from the stove. Make a hole in the
center of the flour, and add the honey mixture while still hot. As
you stir this into the flour, gradually add the brandy. Work this
up into a ball of dough, cover and set aside to ripen in the
refrigerator for eight days. The dough will rise in bulk as it
ripens.
   On the eighth day, roll out the dough \-inch thick and cut into
2{-inch rounds. Set these on greased baking sheets, cover and store
in a cool place overnight.
   Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.
   Bake the cookies 12 to 15 minutes, or until fully risen and pale
brown on the bottom. Cool on racks. As they cool, the cookies will
harden. Store in airtight containers.
   
   ---
   
   Stained Glass, from ``Rose's Christmas Cookies,'' by Rose Levy
Beranbaum (William Morrow and Co. Inc., $19.95)
   Yield: 4 dozen 3-inch cookies
   2} cups bleached all-purpose flour
   { teaspoon baking powder
   { teaspoon salt
   Two-thirds cup sugar
   1 cup unsalted butter
   About half a large egg, lightly beaten
   1{ teaspoons pure vanilla extract
   &lsqb; teaspoon lemon extract
   1 cup sour balls
   
   Soften the butter. In a mixing bowl, cream together the sugar
and butter until fluffy. Add the egg and extracts and beat until
blended. In a small bowl, whisk together the remaining dry
ingredients. On low speed, gradually add them to the butter mixture
and mix just until the dough can be gathered into a ball.
   Scrape the dough onto a sheet of plastic wrap and use the wrap,
not your fingers, to press the dough together to form a thick flat
disc. Wrap it well and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes,
preferably no longer than three hours.
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
   Separate the sour balls into individual colors and pulverize
them separately in a blender or food processor. Place each color in
a small container and set aside.
   Using about a quarter of the dough at a time, roll out the dough
to &lsqb;-inch thickness between two sheets of plastic wrap or on a
lightly floured counter. Cut out cookies with a three-inch cookie
cutter, spraying or greasing the cutter as needed to prevent
sticking.
   With a small, angled metal spatula or pancake turner, transfer
the cookies to cookie sheets lined with aluminum foil and greased.
If you are planning to hang the cookies, make small holes with the
blunt end of a wooden skewer.
   Cut out shapes for the stained glass in each cookie with small
cutters or with a small sharp knife. Use the tip of a small sharp
knife to fill the holes with candy pieces, filling just to the top
of the dough.
   Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the cookies are lightly
browned and the candy has melted completely. For even baking,
rotate the cookie sheets from top to bottom and front to back
halfway through the baking period. Watch carefully toward the end
of baking to see that the candy does not start to carmelize and
turn brown.
   Allow the cookies to cool completely on the sheets. Carefully
peel off the aluminum foil.
   Store in an airtight container, between sheets of wax paper, at
room temperature. Will keep several weeks.

<HEAD>History Exhibition Stirs Political Rumpus in Glasgow</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Perhaps it's a sign of better times in
tough old Glasgow that this year's biggest uproar was about the
past.
   Critics attacked an exhibition about the city's 800 years, which
stressed its relations with the world, for ``sanitizing history.''
   Glasgow's Glasgow, as it was called, closed Nov. 5 and was the
city's biggest attraction in 50 years, drawing half a million
visitors. The show may have lost more than $8 million in a 30-week
run, which the city will have to cover.
   City Hall will announce the cost in February when it presents
the entire bill for the city's year as the European Capital of
Culture.
   The exhibition, promoted as ``Everything Glasgow gave to the
world ... and more,'' was the centerpiece of the year-long festival
celebrating the title bestowed by culture ministers of the
12-nation European Community. Athens, Florence, Amsterdam, Berlin
and Paris were chosen in earlier years.
   Jill Campbell Mackay, public relations director for the cultural
year, said the title Glasgow's Glasgow ``meant how the city
perceived itself as perceived by the outside world.''
   Under 22 arches of storage space below the central railway
station, unused for 60 years, the show assembled 3,200 artifacts of
history, industry and social life.
   They ranged from a model of the yacht Shamrock V, with which
Glasgow grocery tycoon Sir Thomas Lipton made five unsuccessful
tries for the America's Cup, to the suitcase of an emigrant who
paid 2 pounds (then $10) for passage to Canada in the 1920s.
   Documentary films lauded Glasgow's greatness as the second city
of the British Empire, an industrial cornucopia that poured out
textiles, locomotives, weapons and, by 1913, about 60 percent of
the world's ships.
   ``I think the exhibition was a great success,'' said Robert
Palmer, director of the cultural year. ``A space which was dripping
wet, unusable and derelict was renovated, and that space and the
new Arches Theater there seem certain to become a permanent part of
the city's life.''
   An unusual partnership of business and a socialist council
budgeted 50 million pounds ($80 million when the year began) to
make Cultural Capital 1990 a success. About $7 million went for
Glasgow's Glasgow.
   Commercial sponsors contributed cash, materials and assistance
valued at about $1.2 million.
   U.S. Ambassador Henry E. Catto visited the show June 20 and
called it the ``most imaginative exhibition of its kind I have ever
seen.''
   Sniper fire was aimed at it regularly, however, by the daily
Glasgow Herald and Workers' City, a group of left-wing and
anarchist writers, poets, folk musicians and workers. The 60 or so
active Workers' City members champion the class struggle against
what they regard as Glasgow's yuppie ascendancy.
   Glasgow is renowned for fierce partisanship. Alone among British
cities, it is regarded as having come close to revolution - in
1919, during a general strike.
   The red flag was raised in George Square when 20,000
demonstrators demanded a 40-hour work week. While the sheriff read
them the Riot Act, ordering them to disperse, a bottle hit him on
the head. Forty people were seriously injured when horse and foot
police charged the crowd.
   A photograph of tanks and troops assembled at the Cattle Market
was part of Glasgow's Glasgow.
   Although unemployment remains above 14 percent, the cultural
capital designation recognized Glasgow's self-regeneration from
industrial blight, slums, ill health and violence to a humming
center of commerce, tourism and the arts.
   The poor have been moved out of the city center and their
tenements demolished, but to Workers' City they are no better off
in the bleak, damp tower blocks erected for them on Glasgow's
periphery.
   ``We have been accused of being pro-poverty, but it isn't
true,'' said Brendan McLaughlin, owner of the Scotia Bar, where
Workers' City meets.
   ``In the interests of privatizing Glasgow and presenting it as a
place without problems, the Glasgow's Glasgow exhibition buries our
history of industrial struggle.''
   John Murray, the show's marketing executive, said: ``We had the
slums, the drink, the gambling, the crime, the sickness and death
alongside the shipyards, the factories, the scientists and the new
industries.''
   In hopes of making a profit, Glasgow District Council set an
admission charge of 4 pounds (then $6.50) when the show opened in
April.
   After public and press criticism, the price was reduced in July
to a pound (about $1.60). Total attendance was 501,105, largest for
such a show in Glasgow since the Empire Exhibition of 1938
attracted 12{ million visitors from around the world. That one lost
money, too.
   ``No exhibition makes money, but the cost of subsidizing
Glasgow's Glasgow was only half the cost of others in Europe,''
said Doug Clelland, the architect who devised it.
   Clelland is proud of the exhibition's appeal. ``We did three
exit surveys and found 30 percent of the people visiting it had
never before set foot in a museum or gallery,'' he said.

Anti-Semitism</HEAD>

   Aryeh Levin doesn't quite know what his title is.
Israeli consul general? Israeli envoy?
   ``I'm the head of a diplomats' group,'' he said, chuckling,
``with the questionable title of ambassador.''
   Two years after his arrival and two months after the Soviet
Union said it would end its 23-year diplomatic rift with Israel,
Levin still waits to raise his country's white-and-blue flag at an
embassy in central Moscow.
   The Kremlin has said bureaucratic problems are delaying full
consular ties. Levin blamed the ``demon'' of anti-Semitism, which
he said pervades certain ministries and nearly reaches the top
levels of government.
   It's a perception that looms large for Israel and Soviet Jews.
Both hope to cultivate a deeper Jewish presence in the Soviet Union
even as tens of thousands of Jews emigrate.
   ``We need a developed Jewish life,'' said Leonid Stonov, a
prominent Jewish activist. ``We need to increase Jewish dignity.''
   Israeli officials and Soviet Jewish leaders said emigration no
longer defines their attitude toward the Soviet Union, as it did
during much of the Cold War. Cultural and religious expression for
Jews, and trade and social exchanges for Israel, now are nearly
equal to emigration on their list of priorities.
   More than 130,000 Soviet Jews have emigrated this year to
Israel, driven in part by increasing anti-Semitism. Several
thousand more have gone to the United States. About 300,000 Soviet
emigres already live in Israel.
   Of the 1.4 million Jews still in the Soviet Union, about 250,000
live in Moscow.
   Jews who remain can celebrate their holidays openly and attend
Hebrew schools in major cities. A new law on religion guarantees
the right to such practices, many of which formerly were
prohibited.
   Groups have emerged to promote everything from Zionism to Jewish
theater. Last December, 250 such groups formed the Confederation of
Soviet Jewish Organizations to protect Jews and coordinate their
activities.
   ``Our goal is to secure the survival of Soviet Jewry as part of
world Jewry,'' said Mikhail Chlenov, a co-chairman of the
organization.
   Anti-Semitism remains an obstacle. For decades, the Kremlin
painted Israel as a racist state bent on taking Arab land.
   ``In the realm of foreign affairs, where the general `new
thinking' is like a stream, there are little eddies on the side of
this larger current,'' Levin said. ``These little eddies are the
anti-Israeli attitude, the concept of a world Zionist conspiracy.''
   He said those attitudes had delayed restoration of full consular
ties, which would allow Israel itself to issue visas to the
hundreds of Jews who want to leave. The Dutch Embassy now
represents Israel in the Soviet Union and issues the visas.
   Israel and the Kremlin agreed Sept. 30, after three years of
warming relations, to upgrade the delegations in each other's
capitals.
   During that period, Levin arrived in Moscow and his delegation
moved back into the building it occupied before ties were severed
over the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
   Despite the announcement, the state of relations has not
changed. A Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman blamed ``slow-moving
bureaucracy.''
   Levin said ranking Soviet officials told him privately they must
proceed slowly because of ``an anti-Semitic mood.''
   ``They're using it as an excuse and they are at the same time
suffering from it,'' Levin said.
   He expressed optimism that full diplomatic relations could be
restored within a year unless anti-Israeli and anti-Semitic
elements prevail, Levin said.
   ``They all have their own Pavlov reactions to anything that has
to do with Israel,'' he said. ``They have to get rid of this, and
I'm glad to say they are thinking along these lines ... But it will
take time.
   ``People who deal with Israel today in the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs are not Hebraists, they're Arabists. This does not explain
everything, but it goes a long way to explain a few things.''
   Vladimir Nosenko, a Middle East analyst at the Institute of
World Economics and International Relations, echoed that view.
   ``They have an old perception about the role of Israel in the
Middle East, and I'm afraid our bureaucracy is very strong,'' he
said. ``Our anti-Zionist propaganda several years ago created the
basic anti-Semitic problems we have now.''
   Israel hopes diplomatic ties will increase trade and cultural
contacts, Levin said.
   Nosenko said the Soviet Union needs Israel's agricultural
know-how. The two countries have exchanged visits by farming
experts, and Levin said Israel's agriculture minister would travel
to the Soviet Union soon.
   The confederation of Jewish groups is working to open synagogues
and may run candidates for the Soviet parliament, said Chlenov, the
co-chairman.
   ``There is a feeling that Jews were sitting in the far corner of
a big room, and only now they're trying to come out into the
center,'' he said.

   More than a year ago, President Bush and the
nation's governors asked us to imagine an America with drug-free
schools, few dropouts, no illiterates and world-class science and
math students.
   More than that, they promised to put education at the top of the
national agenda.
   This first-ever ``education summit'' took place Sept. 27-28,
1989, and set the stage for ambitious national goals and a
hoped-for revival of U.S. public education by the year 2000.
   The goals were fleshed out in February by the National
Governors' Association and Bush, who promised to be an ``education
president.''
   By the year 2000, he and the governors vowed:
   - All children will start school healthy, well-fed and ``ready
to learn.'' - The high school graduation rate will increase to at
least 90 percent.
   - Students will demonstrate competency in English, mathematics,
science, history, and geography at various grade levels.
   - U.S. students ``will be first in the world in mathematics and
science achievement.''
   - Every adult will be literate and ``possess the knowledge and
skills necessary to compete in a global economy.''
   - Every school ``will be free of drugs and violence and will
offer a disciplined environment conducive to learning.''
   A year later, with war possible in the Mideast, a recession
looming and federal and state budgets in crisis, does anyone still
remember?
   ``People are really becoming aware of our education deficit and
really want to do something about it,'' U.S. Education Secretary
Lauro F. Cavazos insisted in an interview. ``I guarantee you that
Cavazos and the president are not going to let the country forget
it.''
   Discussion in the year since the summit has been dominated by
how to assess educational progress. If standardized tests, which
ones? Should progress be measured state by state, or should states
be measured against independent yardsticks?
   On Wednesday, a 14-member National Education Goals panel
consisting of six governors, four high-ranking Bush administration
officials and four congressional leaders plan to meet in Washington
to explore the assessment question.
   The panel, led by Colorado Gov. Roy Romer, will try to decide on
a format for a state-by-state ``report card'' in time for the
second anniversary of the summit.
   Romer said his group has opted for thoroughness over speed:
   ``We have not been willing to deal with it on a surface,
knee-jerk basis. We've been examining whether our current methods,
including standardized tests, tell us what we want to know.''
   But besides assessment, some fear precious time has been lost in
a politically charged debate over whether money is the key to
reform, or ``restructuring'' schools, or perhaps, as the Bush
administration insists, giving parents tax breaks to choose any
school they wish.
   Cavazos is among those who argues that schools won't get far
unless principals, teachers and parents get more authority and
autonomy.
   ``If we do not bring about restructuring, then it's going to be
very difficult to reach those goals,'' he said.
   But if reaching them depends on changing classroom habits formed
over a century, reform will be a long, long haul.
   Many teachers, principals and school superintendents still
regard ``restructuring'' as a threat to their authority or to
long-cherished habits.
   A month ago, for example, teachers in Rochester, N.Y., rejected
a trailblazing contract that included many such reform features,
even though top pay would have risen beyond $80,000.
   ``I think within the education establishment, there has been
skepticism over whether these goals are realizable or believable,''
said Ernest L. Boyer, president of the Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching. ``Among group practitioners, there's not
much realization that goals mean anything to them.''
   Some believe drug-free schools may prove the most reachable of
the six goals. Drugs remain a serious problem at home and in the
streets, but substance abuse appears to be on the wane within many
schools.
   ``I think we have done a very creditable job of getting it out
of our schools. I don't mean to be a Pollyanna, but that is
probably the most attainable goal,'' said Timothy Dyer, executive
director of the National Association of Secondary School
Principals.
   At the opposite extreme, it's hard to find anyone who believes
U.S. students will soar from last place to first internationally in
math and science skills by the year 2000 - certainly not without
Herculean shifts in local school district priorities and
significant new investments in teacher training.
   ``I think that to have such a goal is laudable. But to say that
it would happen within this decade is a bit ambitious,'' said Iris
Carl, president of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.
   ``I don't think it's achievable because we are victims of a
math-anxious society. Adults boast that they didn't do well in
math,'' she said.
   Skeptics add that it may also be a long struggle just to agree
on definitions for problems like ``illiteracy'' or ``dropout,''
much less solve them.
   If ``dropout'' means all adults who lack a high school degree or
the equivalent, the national rate is only about 12 percent and the
goal of 10 percent is just around the corner.
   But if ``dropout'' means all 9th-graders who fail to graduate in
four years, the rate stands at 27 percent.
   Romer said he hopes his panel can arrive at a working definition
in the next month or so. It remains to be seen whether he can get
politicians and more than 15,000 school districts to agree to it.
   Hopes for defining illiteracy, meanwhile, center on the National
Assessment of Educational Progress, a Princeton, N.J., testing body
that is planning to assess the skills of 20,000 to 30,000 adults.
Results are due in January 1993 and should provide the first
meaningful benchmark for measuring adult literacy.
   ``I think, frankly, we've lost some time over the past year over
the politics of how to implement the goals,'' said Boyer, of the
Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.
   ``The real questions are: How do we move toward the goals and
assess the progress? It's high time we decided who's in charge.''

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are more details of the six education goals and objectives
approved last February by President Bush and the National
Governors' Association:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>READINESS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   - By the year 2000, all children in America will start school
ready to learn.
   1. All disadvantaged and disabled children will have access to
high quality and developmentally appropriate preschool programs
that help prepare children for school.
   2. Every parent in America will be a child's first teacher and
devote time each day helping his or her preschool child learn;
parents will have access to the training and support they need.
   3. Children will receive the nutrition and health care needed to
arrive at school with healthy minds and bodies, and the number of
low birthweight babies will be significantly reduced through
enhanced prenatal health systems.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SCHOOL COMPLETION:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   - By the year 2000, the high school graduation rate will
increase to at least 90 percent.
   1. The nation must dramatically reduce its dropout rate and 75
percent of those students who do drop out will successfully
complete a high school degree or its equivalent.
   2. The gap in high school graduation rates between American
students from minority backgrounds and their non-minority
counterparts will be eliminated.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND CITIZENSHIP:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   - By the year 2000, American students will leave grades four,
eight and 12 having demonstrated competency over challenging
subject matter including English, mathematics, science, history,
and geography, and every school in America will ensure that all
students learn to use their minds well, so they may be prepared for
responsible citizenship, further learning and productive employment
in our modern economy.
   1. The academic performance of elementary and secondary students
will increase significantly in every quartile, and the distribution
of minority students in each level will more closely reflect the
student population as a whole.
   2. The percentage of students who demonstrate the ability to
reason, solve problems, apply knowledge, and write and communicate
effectively will increase substantially.
   3. All students will be involved in activities that promote and
demonstrate good citizenship, community service, and personal
responsibility.
   4. The percentage of students who are competent in more than one
language will substantially increase.
   5. All students will be knowledgeable about the diverse cultural
heritage of this nation and about the world community.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   - By the year 2000, U.S. students will be first in the world in
mathematics and science achievement.
   1. Math and science education will be strengthened throughout
the system, especially in the early grades.
   2. The number of teachers with a substantive background in
mathematics and science will increase by 50 percent.
   3. The number of U.S. undergraduate and graduate students,
especially women and minorities, who complete degrees in
mathematics, science, and engineering will increase significantly.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ADULT LITERACY AND LIFETIME LEARNING:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   - By the year 2000, every adult American will be literate and
will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a
global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of
citizenship.
   1. Every major American business will be involved in
strengthening the connection between education and work.
   2. All workers will have the opportunity to acquire the
knowledge and skills, from basic to highly technical, needed to
adapt to emerging new technologies, work methods, and markts
through public and private educational, vocational, technical,
workplace, or other programs.
   3. The number of quality programs, including those at libraries,
that are designed to serve more effectively the needs of the
growing number of part-time and midcareer students will increase
substantially.
   4. The proportion of those qualified students, especially
minorities, who enter college, who complete at least two years and
who complete their degree programs will increase substantially.
   5. The proportion of college graduates who demonstrate an
advanced ability to think critically, communicate effectively and
solve problems will increase substantially.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SAFE, DISCIPLINED, AND DRUG-FREE SCHOOLS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   - By the year 2000, every school in America will be free of
drugs and violence and will offer a disciplined environment
conducive to learning.
   1. Every school will implement a firm and fair policy on use,
possession, and distribution of drugs and alcohol.
   2. Parents, businesses, and community organizations will work
together to ensure that schools are a safe haven for all children.
   3. Every school district will develop a comprehensive K-12 drug
and alcohol prevention education program. Drug and alcohol
curriculum should be taught as an integral part of health
education. In addition, community-based teams should be organized
to provide students and teachers with needed support.

   Advertising spending this year is growing at the
slowest pace since the mid-1970s and could slow even further in
1991, a prominent industry forecaster said.
   Robert Coen, of the ad agency McCann-Erickson, said Monday he
expects U.S. ad spending will rise 4.9 percent to $130.1 billion
this year and 4.6 percent to $136 billion in 1991.
   He blamed the slowdown on the economic downturn and worries
created by the Persian Gulf standoff.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The government is preparing to lend up to $7
billion to entice buyers to hard-to-sell property it inherited from
failed savings and loans - a move critics denounced as a way to
postpone resolving the mess.
   ``They're just going to sink into the same quicksand that the
S&amp;L operators couldn't pull themselves out of,'' said Rep. Bruce
Vento, D-Minn., who heads a House task force overseeing the
bailout. ``I just think they would be better off to face up to the
problem now.
   The Resolution Trust Corp. Oversight Board more than doubled the
lending limit from the previous $3 billion in the move that was
revealed Monday.

   VIENNA, Austria (AP) - OPEC ministers have arrived here for
strategy talks that are likely to leave intact a boost in oil
production approved in August after Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   But, during their annual winter meeting, ministers of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will no doubt fret
privately about the recent unexpected softening of world crude
prices.
   ---
   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Bush administration is reviewing scores of
ideas for reducing America's dependence on foreign oil, including a
50-cent-a-gallon gas tax and easing environmental barriers for
building energy plants.
   Although in the works for nearly two years, Energy Department
officials say the crafting of a national policy gained momentum and
urgency after the Persian Gulf crisis cast a spotlight on U.S.
reliance on oil imports.
   Environmentalists are already attacking the plan, which goes to
President Bush later this month.
   ---
   ATLANTA (AP) - GTE Corp. and Contel Corp. shareholders were
voting on a merger creating the nation's second-largest
mobile-cellular telephone company, at a time when the industry is
enjoying continued growth.
   The $6.2 billion merger, that was to be voted on Tuesday at
separate shareholders' meetings in New York and Stamford, Conn., is
expected to be approved. But because of remaining regulatory
hurdles, company officials are predicting the merger will not be
completed until the second quarter of 1991.
   The combined company would be second in size to McCaw Cellular
Communications Inc., the nation's top cellular phone operation.
   ---
   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Security Pacific Corp. said it would set
aside $850 million for bad loans, foreclosed real estate and
restructuring costs, a move that will result in a fourth-quarter
loss of up to $360 million.
   The Los Angeles concern, the nation's fifth-largest bank holding
company, said Monday its profit for the 1990 fiscal year will
decline to about $160 million, compared with $741 million in 1989.
   ---
   NEW YORK (AP) - A group of asbestos victims filed a petition to
send Eagle-Picher Industries Inc. into involuntary bankruptcy,
possibly derailing a settlement plan in the worker health crisis.
   The petition was filed Monday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Cincinnati, where Eagle-Picher is based.
   The motion, by three asbestos victims, was filed while a hearing
was being conducted before U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein in
Brooklyn federal court on the controversial settlement plan.

   EAGAN, Minn. (AP) - Northwest Airlines will invest in struggling
Hawaiian Airlines in exchange for some of the Honolulu-based
carrier's lucrative South Pacific routes, the air carriers
announced.
   Northwest would own 25 percent of Hawaiian Airlines after paying
the airline and its parent, HAL Inc., $20 million, including $7
million as a secured loan, according to a statement released
Monday.
   ---
   NEW YORK (AP) - If you've always wanted to ride a train across
the country, but didn't have the time to take it all the way back,
United Airlines and Amtrak may have just the deal you've been
waiting for.
   They unveiled a train-plane ticketing agreement Monday that will
offer passengers a cheaper fare when they fly one way and ride the
rails the other way.
   The setup would also allow travelers to fly into certain major
gateway cities, then take trains around the region before returning
to the gateway city to fly home.

<TEXT>
   A $10.1 billion privatization of Britain's
electricity industry was a huge success, the government said, with
Britons seeking more than 10 times the number of shares being
offered.
   Demand from the public was so strong, in fact, that it triggered
a ``clawback'' mechanism that scaled back the amount of shares
reserved for both foreign investors and domestic institutional
investors, said Kleinwort Benson Ltd., the government's financial
advisor.
   Kleinwort said Monday the offer was 10.7 times oversubscribed by
the general public.
   Under the offering, the government sold a total 2.16 billion
shares in the 12 electricity distributing companies of England and
Wales. The shares sold for 240 pence, or $4.68 each, for a total
5.18 billion pounds ($10.1 billion).
   The government plans to sell its two electricity generating
companies and the Scottish electricity industry next year.
   The sell-off is Britain's biggest and most complex privatization
yet. The Conservative government has sold $64 billion worth of
state-owned companies over the past decade to promote capitalism
and encourage wider ownership of the companies.
   The privatizations include telephone, gas, and water utilities,
as well as British Airways PLC, British Aerospace PLC and the
automaker Jaguar PLC, which has since been bought by Ford Motor Co.
   Critics had questioned the government's timing of its latest
sale, noting that many investors have shied away from the stock
market since the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. They also cite
the worldwide economic slowdown.
   The government had planned to cancel the sale if a war broke out
in the Persian Gulf.
   But Kleinwort said it received 12.75 million applications from
individual investors, the highest response ever for a government
privatization.
   Energy Secretary John Wakeham said only about 25 percent of the
applicants will receive all the shares they requested, and many
investors will receive only the minimum 100 shares because of the
huge demand.
   He said some shares will go to about 97 percent of the
applicants who are electricity customers, while two-thirds of all
applicants will receive some shares.
   Officials noted the ``clawback'' provision will boost the
percentage of shares available to the public to 54.6 percent from
34.4 percent. British institutional investors will now get 30.4
percent of shares and foreign investors will receive 15 percent.
   Shares will begin trading Tuesday afternoon. Analysts are
predicting prices will jump 40 percent to 50 percent when trading
begins.
   The London Stock Exchange plans to remain open an extra 90
minutes Tuesday to accommodate anticipated heavy dealing.
   ``There might very well be a scramble tomorrow afternoon for the
shares'' among institutions that saw their allocations scaled back,
said Sean Darby, an analyst at the investment firm Yamaichi
International (Europe) Ltd.
   ``The government has made sure that everybody has got something,
but basically they kept it down to the lowest rung,'' he said.

<HEAD>Germany's Largest Auto Producer Planning Massive Investment In
Skoda</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WOLFSBURG, Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Volkswagen plans to invest up to $6.3
billion in the Czechoslovak car company Skoda, the German carmaker
said after winning a bid to take over the company.
   Franstisek Vlasak, deputy premier of the Czech republic, told a
news conference in Prague on Monday that cooperation between the
two car companies will begin in January.
   A joint stock venture will be formed, with Volkswagen pumping in
some $300 million at the start, Vlasak said.
   Ortwin Witzel, a Volkswagen spokesman, said Skoda's 21,000
employees were assured of no layoffs in the deal, which is to begin
with a 35 percent investment in Skoda next year that will reach 70
percent by 1995.
   On Sunday, Czechoslovakia announced that Volkswagen had outbid
Renault of France and Sweden's Volvo for Skoda.
   The company is considered one of the best auto manufacturers in
Eastern Europe. It has a long manufacturing tradition, using its
own designs, and its cars have a reputation for reliability.
   Volkswagen said Skoda will become another of VW's subsidiaries,
joining Audi and Volkswagen in Germany and SEAT in Spain.
   In the first stage beginning next year, Volkswagen said the
venture will produce 200,000 Favorit-model Skodas. By 1997, that
number is to increase to 400,000 cars a year.
   Skoda currently produces about 250,000 cars a year.
   Volkswagen said it foresees a market of up to 3 million vehicles
in the central European region by the year 2000.
   Volkswagen said it will modernize Skoda's main manufacturing
facility in Mlada Boleslav and eventually build a new engine
factory and assembly plant.
   Volkswagen said the motor plant is to be completed by 1995 and
produce about 500,000 engines for the Czechoslovak auto industry as
well as for other Volkswagen units.
   An international distribution network will also be developed to
sell Skoda cars outside Europe, the company said.
   A contract must still be signed between the two companies and a
new leadership named.
   Miroslav Gregr, Czech minister of engineering, said Monday in
Prague that it may be possible to sign the basic provisions of the
contract by the end of the year.

<HEAD>Forecaster Expects Sluggish Ad Spending Growth Through 1991</HEAD>

   Advertising spending is expected to grow next
year at the slowest pace in more than two decades but should pick
up along with the economy in 1992, a prominent industry forecaster
says.
   Some analysts say the forecast may be too optimistic, while
other executives expressed reservations about whether the economy
will improve as expected in the second half of 1991.
   Robert Coen, an executive at the ad agency McCann-Erickson, said
Monday he expects U.S. ad spending will rise 4.9 percent to $130.1
billion this year, the smallest increase since 4.8 percent in 1975.
   Next year, he said, spending should grow 4.6 percent to $136
billion, the smallest increase since a 0.7 percent increase in
1970.
   Coen blamed the slowdown on the economic downturn and worries
created by the Persian Gulf standoff. Newspapers are being
especially hard hit.
   Coen, whose semiannual forecasts of ad spending trends for the
investment firm PaineWebber Inc. are the most closely watched in
the industry, has scaled back his estimate of ad spending growth
for 1990 twice in the past year.
   Last December, he said domestic ad spending would grow 6.2
percent in 1990. He trimmed that projection to 5.3 percent last
June.
   Coen said he is hopeful that improvements in the economy in the
latter half of 1991 and the prospect of the Olympic Games ``could
start another resurgence in ad spending'' in 1992.
   He told the 18th annual PaineWebber media conference that
national ad spending will rise 6.7 percent to $73.6 billion this
year while local ad spending will increase a meager 2.8 percent to
$56.5 billion.
   National ad spending is doing better than his December 1989
forecast of a 6.3 percent increase, but local ad spending has come
in well below his earlier estimate of 6.2 percent growth.
   He said newspapers, for instance, saw local ad spending grow at
a slim 1 percent pace this year as spending by retailers slumped
due to their heavy debt loads, the poor business environment and
deteriorating consumer confidence.
   In addition, he said the deepening decline in classified ad
spending resulting from rising unemployment and a sluggish housing
market ``made it a disastrous year'' for local ad spending in
newspapers.
   He expects only 2 percent growth in local ad spending in
newspapers next year, but added that a revival in the economy could
lead to a ``fast turnaround.''
   National advertising, on the other hand, was stronger than
expected this year partly because of increased competition for
market share in categories such as coffee, credit cards and mutual
funds, Coen said.
   For 1991, Coen said he expects national ad spending will rise
5.7 percent and local ad spending will increase 3.1 percent.
   ``Until unemployment rates fall and the real estate and housing
sectors turn around, we must continue to be pessimistic about local
ad growth next year,'' Coen said.
   Gordon Medenica, vice president for corporate planning at the
ew York Times Co., said operating profits in the newspaper
industry fell about 3 percent in 1990 and could fall another 2 to 4
percentage points next year.
   He said he was also ``a little worried about this consensus
forecast'' that the economy will improve in the second half.
   Jack Butcher, circulation director at The Tampa (Fla.) Tribune,
said he expects the average cover price of newspapers will rise to
35 cents daily and $1 on Sundays in 1991 from their current levels
of 30 cents and 75 cents.
   But he said he expects the industry will still be able to show
circulation growth of 0.5 percent to 1 percent because improvements
such as more localized reporting, better printing quality and color
have been made.
   Some analysts said Coen may be too optimistic about national ad
spending next year.
   His forecast, for example, calls for a 6.1 percent rise in
national broadcast advertising compared with 7.8 percent in 1990.
   But David F. Poltrack, a top researcher at the CBS Broadcast
Group, said he expects ad spending on the Big Three television
networks will rise only 2 percent this year and 2 percent in 1991.
   He said revenue at CBS, ABC and NBC was about 5 percent ahead of
last year for the first nine months of 1990 but that ``the bottom
fell out of the market'' in the fourth quarter, which ``will be
down significantly from 1989.''
   Ad spending growth outside the United States continues to
outpace domestic ad spending increases, Coen said.
   He said ad spending overseas rose 12.6 percent to $145.5 billion
in 1990, and is expected to increase 7.5 percent to $156.4 billion
in 1991.

<HEAD>Judge Approves Class Action in Key Worker Health Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In a major step toward resolving the nation's
biggest product liability issue, a federal judge has consolidated
tens of thousands of lawsuits against a company filed by victims of
asbestos-related diseases.
   U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein late Monday certified a
class action for 65,000 worker health claims against Eagle-Picher
Industries Inc. and froze all litigation against the
Cincinnati-based industrial products maker.
   But victims' lawyers said Weinstein had flouted legal procedure,
appointed partisan attorneys to negotiate with the company who
supported his desires and sought to force a settlement they said
was unfair.
   ``The judge's attitude is there is no Constitution among
friends,'' said Ron Motley, a Charleston, S.C., attorney for
several thousands asbestos victims.
   ``He was not acting as judge. He was acting as king,'' said Fred
Baron, a Dallas plaintiffs lawyer. ``Fortunately in this country
the laws are not determined by kings.''
   Lawyers said they would appeal Weinstein's order, which also
appeared to violate an automatic halt on legal proceedings in the
case imposed when a motion was filed Monday in Cincinnati to place
Eagle-Picher in involuntary bankruptcy.
   If it succeeds, Weinstein's plan could become a model for dozens
of companies struggling under the burden of asbestos liability and
help clear state and federal courts nationwide of 90,000 asbestos
cases.
   Litigation has mounted since the early 1970s, when medical
evidence grew that asbestos was responsible for lung cancer and
other respiratory diseases in Americans who worked in shipbuilding,
boilermaking and other trades where the mineral was used as a fire
retardant and insulator.
   The biggest case involves the Manville trust fund, which faces
130,000 claims. The fund has run out of cash and is being
reorganized under Weinstein's orders. The trust was created out of
the 1988 bankruptcy reorganization of Manville Corp., once the
nation's largest asbestos user.
   Weinstein, who crafted a class-action solution to illnesses
caused by the Vietnam War defoliant Agent Orange, wants to
consolidate asbestos cases to eliminate long and costly trials that
have delayed payments to victims and squandered money on legal
costs.
   ``Judge Weinstein is out to break the logjam of national
asbestos litigation by certifying the class, which will be the
beginning of the end of asbestos litigation,'' said Kenneth
Feinberg, a Weinstein-appointed mediator in the Eagle-Picher case.
   Eagle-Picher, which favors the class action, has said it faces
bankruptcy unless it solves its asbestos problems. It is liable for
injuries caused by cement insulation products containing asbestos
it made from 1931 to 1971.
   The company has spent $540 million in the last five years on its
asbestos obligations and faces an estimated $600 million in future
claims. It has sold assets to pay claims, but is running out of
divisions to pawn as well as insurance. The first case against the
company was made in 1966 and about 20,000 new claims are being
filed annually.
   Under the settlement plan, Eagle-Picher would place an estimated
$625 million into a trust fund over 20 years. The trust also would
receive 25 percent of Eagle-Picher stock and 50 percent if the
company failed to meet its annual payments after five years.
Payments would not begin until November 1993.
   Plaintiffs lawyers said the plan provides too little money and
that victims would do better if Eagle-Picher filed for bankruptcy.
The main stumbling block appeared to be a demand that the trust
control Eagle-Picher stock, which the company refused.
   Only one of three lawyers appointed by Weinstein to represent
current Eagle-Picher victims has approved the plan, and he doesn't
have any asbestos clients. More than 90 attorneys with 40,000
asbestos clients signed a petition opposing the proposal.
   ``There is a massive lack of confidence in the settlement,''
Grant Hering, a New York plaintiffs lawyer, told the judge. ``For
people who are victims, who have suffered what they have suffered,
it is a gimmick they can't comprehend.''
   Weinstein interrupted hearings on the plan in Brooklyn federal
court to certify the class action. He froze all litigation
involving Eagle-Picher pending a final settlement, except for
payment of $45 million in already negotiated claims.
   The judge issued the order despite an automatic stay from the
involuntary bankruptcy petition filing, which he called
``fraudulent on its face.'' The motion was filed at the behest of
plaintiffs lawyers by three victims who said Eagle-Picher had not
met settlement agreements.
   In a statement, Eagle-Picher called the bankruptcy petition
``totally without merit.'' It said it did not believe the three
victims had legal standing to file the petition.
   Weinstein appointed a former federal judge to study whether
claimants would receive more money in a bankruptcy reorganization
or the settlement. He said hearings on the plan's fairness would be
held in New York, Cincinnati and Detroit.
   Eagle-Picher stock fell 75 cents to close at $3.25 Monday on the
New York Stock Exchange. Weinstein made his ruling after the
markets closed.

<HEAD>New Cellular Technology Promises To Boost Capacity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The entrance of a General Motors Corp.
subsidiary into the race for the next-generation cellular phone
technology will increase an industry fight over which system will
prevail, industry analysts say.
   GM Hughes Electronics has developed technology it says will
increase the capacity of cellular phone systems fifteenfold, which
would be a boon to overcrowded systems in cities such as New York
and Los Angeles.
   ``If they're successful, it's going to bring the cellular
industry to a big stall because people won't know what to do,''
said John Pemberton of the high-tech research firm Gartner Group
Inc. ``The standards battle could rage on for two years.''
   The Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association, the
industry's main trade group, already has approved specifications
for a digital technology that would replace today's analog cellular
phones.
   But the most-advanced digital phone system envisioned by the
trade group would only increase capacity six times - below the
tenfold increase the nation's cellular phone operators say they
will need to meet expected demand.
   The trade group announced Monday night that nine large cellular
phone equipment makers agreed to a timetable for readying digital
phone gear that uses the group's standard. Under it, prototype
equipment will be tested by March 31, meaning production should
start later next year, the group said.
   The companies are Motorola Inc., American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
Co., Ericsson, Audiovox, Mitsubishi, NovAtel, OKI Telecom, Sony and
Uniden.
   Hughes' digital system, to be formally announced today, would
provide much greater capacity than the systems to be tested. It is
based on the same technology, called time-division multiple access,
which allows several calls to be sent simultaneously over the same
channel. But Hughes' system is more advanced.
   The time-division technique introduces minute pauses into each
call; during these pauses, another call in the cellular network is
sent. Because the delays are so short and the call is sent in
computer language, the pauses are not noticed by the user.
   But Hughes' system also uses pauses in conversations to send
other calls, said Pradeep P. Kaul, executive vice president of
Hughes Network Systems Inc., the Hughes subsidiary that developed
the system.
   For example, when a caller pauses in a conversation to listen to
the other party, the speaking portion of the signal would be
switched off, making it available for another call. As soon as the
caller resumes speaking, a speach-recognition device would switch
the signal back on.
   Hughes' system will compete with a technology called
code-division multiple access. In it, several calls are sent at
once over the same channel, but each is preceded by a special code.
The receiving equipment only picks up calls with a particular code.
   Code-division technology has been developed by a small San Diego
company called Qualcomm. AT&amp;T and Motorola, the two largest U.S.
makers of cellular telephone equipment, are exploring Qualcomm's
technology as well as time-division techniques.
   Industry analysts say they believe time-division technology will
be used, at least initially, to boost the capacity of overtaxed
cellular systems in major metropolitan areas.
   But once the capacity of these time-division systems is reached,
the industry will need yet another replacement, said Jason
LaMountain, an analyst with the Boston research firm Yankee Group
Inc.
   He said Hughes is one of a number of companies trying to boost
time-division technology to greater capacity. At the same time,
code-division technology will be vying for the replacement market,
he said. Proponents of this technology say it could boost capacity
by twenty times over current analog systems.
   As for the winner, ``I think it's going to be which one works.
None of them have been proven in the market,'' LaMountain said.
   In another cellular development, Motorola said Monday it had
devised an enhanced analog system that increases capacity threefold
over current systems. It said it would began testing it in January.
   Hughes says it will use its technology to make the switching
equipment used in each ``cell,'' or geographic area, of a cellular
phone system, and license the technology to other equipment makers.
It also said it would work with GM's Delco Electronics Corp. to
develop phones that would be built into the dashboards of cars.
   In addition, Hughes announced that the French phone-equipment
maker Alactel would make the central-office phone switching
equipment to be used with Hughes' cellular system.

<HEAD>T. Boone Pickens and Japanese Company At It Again</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If the verbal skirmishes between a Japanese
auto parts maker and Texas investor T. Boone Pickens were a series
of movie sequels they'd by up to number XIV or XV by now.
   On Monday, Koito Manufacturing Co. called on Pickens to disclose
all the details of his arrangement with a Japanese stock speculator
to acquire a large stake in the company.
   Last week, a new Japanese securities law forced Pickens, who has
portrayed himself as a David battling the Goliath of Japan's
corporate system, to acknowledge that his 26.4 percent stake in
Koito was backed - at least in part - by stock speculator Kitaro
Watanabe.
   Koito has used the specter of Watanabe to rebuff Pickens'
attempts to secure representation on its board of directors, even
though he is the largest single shareholder. The company claims
Pickens is merely acting on behalf of Watanabe in another attempt
by the Tokyo investor to obtain ``greenmail'' from Koito.
   Greenmail, a play on the word blackmail, is what a company pays
when it buys back its own stock from a potential raider at rates
above the going market price.
   Koito has claimed that before Watanabe sold his stake to Pickens
in March 1989, he tried to pursuade carmaker Toyota Motor Corp.,
Koito's second-largest shareholder, to buy his stock at
higher-than-market prices.
   ``It appears clear from your own statements that the entire
transaction was an outright sham,'' Koito's president, Takao
Matsuura, wrote Pickens.
   Pickens has disclosed that he bought 42.4 million shares, or
26.4 percent of Koito, from Watanabe, who loaned him the money
after Pickens put up the shares as collateral. The shares are now
worth an estimated $1 billion.
   Pickens also submitted an affidavit stating he will not accept
greenmail.
   ``Now that you have acknowledged your secret arrangement with
Mr. Watanabe, I must insist that you disclose the remaining details
that your filing omits,'' the Koito president wrote.
   He wanted to know the conditions of the loan and what interest
Pickens' Dallas-based Boone Co. had paid on it.
   But the new Japanese law does not require Pickens, who has
steadfastly denied that he is fronting for Watanabe, to disclose
further details about the loan.
   ``According to our lawyers and the (Japanese) Ministry of
Finance, those are the two material agreements that we have to
reveal regarding the ownership of the Koito stock,'' said a Pickens
spokesman in Washington, Mark Helmke. ``Now comes Koito, saying
`You haven't told us what your interest rate is. You haven't told
us what your payment schedule is.' None of that's required.''
   Helmke added: ``That's the game they play. If the Ministry of
Finance wants to require everybody in Japan to disclose that
information we would be be happy to comply. They want the Americans
to disclose more than what they require of the Japanese.''

   Regulators hope to unload hard-to-sell real
estate and junk bonds inherited from failed savings and loans by
financing 85 percent or more of the purchase price.
   Real estate agents and builders are applauding the move, a major
strategy shift for the Resolution Trust Corp., as a realistic
recognition of the credit crunch that is pinching real estate
markets.
   But a congressional critic charged Monday that the new policy is
only a costly way of postponing resolution of the S&amp;L mess.
   ``They're just going to sink into the same quicksand that the
S&amp;L operators couldn't pull themselves out of,'' said Rep. Bruce
Vento, D-Minn., who heads a House task force monitoring the
bailout. ``I just think they would be better off to face up to the
problem now.''
   The RTC Oversight Board is more than doubling the lending limit
from the previous $3 billion. Vento's panel planned to review the
policy and other aspects of the RTC's performance at a hearing
today.
   In the deteriorating economy, the agency has encountered far
more problems than anticipated in selling real estate, junk bonds
and other assets inherited from failed S&amp;Ls.
   Banks in many regions also have grown increasingly reluctant to
lend, particularly on commercial real estate, causing what
borrowers complain is a shortage of credit.
   By offering financing, the RTC is, in effect, becoming its own
bank.
   ``The goals of the program are to speed asset sales and increase
the value to taxpayers from such sales,'' said oversight board
President Peter Monroe.
   However, Vento said, the government will run the risk of having
to repossess financed properties if buyers default. It's better to
sell the property outright at whatever price can be obtained, he
said.
   ``The administration, frankly, has been offering one excuse
after another as to why they can't do what they said they were
going to do,'' Vento said.
   However, analysts said real estate markets are so slack in areas
where the RTC owns property that the agency has little choice.
   ``Their backs are to the wall,'' said economist Robert Litan of
the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based research group.
``Ordinarily, if it weren't for the recession, they shouldn't be
doing this.''
   Kent Colton, executive vice president of the National
Association of Home Builders, endorsed the strategy shift as ``a
recognition of the credit crunch that has prevented buyers from
obtaining private financing.''
   ``It will revive real estate markets in the South and Southwest,
where many of the properties are located,'' said Harley E. Rouda,
president of the National Association of Realtors.
   Economist Paul M. Horvitz of the University of Houston said the
financing policy would work provided the RTC demands enough of a
down payment.
   ``People in Texas tell me it is difficult to get financing on a
traditional basis for the acquisition of real estate. In that
situation, it makes sense to me for the RTC to be willing to
provide financing as long as the buyer puts up some reasonable
amount of equity,'' he said.
   In general, the RTC will require at least a 15 percent down
payment, but in some cases may accept less.
   About half of the $142 billion in assets controlled by the
agency will be eligible for financing. Much of it is commercial
real estate but some illiquid financial assets, such as junk bonds,
are also eligible.
   Before the agency can lend the government's money to buyers, the
oversight board said it must determine that no ready market exists
for the asset and then document that providing a loan will help the
government get a better price on the sale.
   The agency hopes to sell the loans it makes, thereby making more
money available for financing.
   The oversight board decided on its new financing policy in
private late Friday and announced it after business hours.
   The five-member panel, headed by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F.
Brady, controls the policy and purse strings of the bailout agency.
The panel includes Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, Housing
Secretary Jack Kemp and two private citizens.

<HEAD>Farm Bureau Calls Wants U.S. to Stand Firm on GATT Deadline</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Stands for PM-Farm Scene</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress needs to stand firm behind a March 1
deadline for an international trade agreement in order to assure
that meat and grain producers have better access to world markets,
the American Farm Bureau Federation says.
   ``It is probably imperative that the Congress agree or follows
through with the administration's analysis that Congress isn't
going to change the fast-track deadline unless there is reason
to,'' bureau spokesman Donald Lipton said Monday.
   He also said President Bush needed to exercise personal
diplomacy to break the deadlock in international trade talks, a
step the administration said Monday it was plannin to take.
   President Bush ``undoubtedly will be talking to various leaders
about the GATT situation,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said, using the acronym for General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
the framework agreement for world trade.
   Lipton, like many farm group representatives, went to Brussels,
Belgium, last week to observe the meeting of trade ministers hoping
to conclude the so-called Uruguay Round of talks with an agreement
on how to conduct trade into the 21st century.
   However, the delegates never came close to agreement because of
a fight between the United States and the 12-nation European
Community over farm subsidies.
   The United States, backed by Australia, Brazil and other major
farm exporters, was seeking sharp reductions in subsidies. The EC
claimed the U.S. proposal would force more than 2 million of its 10
million farmers off the land.
   The trade ministers told GATT Director Arthur Dunkel in Brussels
to try to get at least low-level discussions started again by late
January.
   Under the fast-track provision of U.S. trade law, the
administration has a deadline for submitting an agreement to
Congress and Congress has a deadline for ratifying it without any
changes.
   The deadline can be extended legislatively for a two-year
period.
   Lipton said that without the deadline, other industry groups
with an interest in the outcome of the trade proposal could lobby
to weaken the agricultural provisions. But he also said he was also
encouraged by what he saw last week.
   ``In Brussels, it was remarkable how united the various sectors
were,'' he said, referring to U.S. groups with an interest in the
other provisions, such as intellectual property, services and
investments.
   Other farm interests agreed with Lipton that the desirability of
other provisions could help force an agreement on farm products as
well.
   ``They've got a lot at stake over there,'' said Keith Heard,
executive vice president of the National Corn Growers Association.
   ``I'm guardedly optimistic,'' said Marlyn Jorgensen, a Garrison,
Iowa, soybean farmer and board chairman of the American Soybean
Association. ``I think there was, in the end, kind of a feeling by
most other countries that we needed something to happen.''
   If there is no agreement, ``then I think that we do have to turn
back to Congress'' and ask that a so-called ``snap-back'' provision
under the 1990 Farm Bill be implemented, Jorgensen said.
   The five-year farm bill, reflecting budget problems, cut farm
supports by one-fourth, he noted. The snap-back provision allows
Congress to restore supports if there is no trade agreement, but
not for two years.
   He said the United States could increase credit guarantees to
the Soviet Union to help growers.
   Meat producers want the United States to flex some muscle
immediately.
   ``In the interim, I'd like to see the government take some
action to show we're intent upon forcing our rights,'' said Michael
Kopps, senior vice president for legislative affairs at the
American Meat Institute.
   He said the U.S. Trade Representative could vigorously pursue
the industry's complaint about European restrictions on American
meat products, including the Oct. 30 ban on pork imports and the
announced Dec. 31 ban on beef. The European Community Commission
said the bans were due to lack of proper sanitation in the United
States.
   Domestic sugar plant growers and dairy farmers, meanwhile, were
not enthusiastic about the U.S.-backed agricultural proposals.
   Dalton Yancey, a spokesman for sugar cane and sugar beet
growers, said he objected to a percentage formula for cutting price
supports, because the European guaranteed price is much higher than
the U.S. price: 32 cents vs. 18 cents.
   The guaranteed price is part of the farm bill, and is maintained
by restricting imports. Critics say the policy deprives Latin
American producing countries of an important source of income and
causes consumer prices to be artificially high.
   Peter Vitaliano of the National Milk Producers Federation said
the group opposes any plan to increase imports and called the
dispute ``a grain trade issue to a great extent.''

<HEAD>Metzenbaum Sees Insurance Industry in Possible Peril</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The life insurance industry, which controls
nearly $2 trillion, could suffer the same fate as the savings and
loans, jeopardizing the financial security of millions of
Americans, a senator contends.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, who chairs the Senate Judiciary
subcommittee on antitrust, said financially shaky insurers are able
to conceal their real problems through questionable accounting
gimmicks and with little policing from the states.
   But A.M. Best Co., which operates a well-regarded system of
rating insurance companies, says insurers have maintained their
secure standing, especially in comparison to other financial
industries.
   ``We ... do not agree that the insurance industry as a whole at
this point in time is on the brink of financial crisis analogous to
that of the savings and loan industry,'' Michael Albanese, a Best
analyst, told the subcommittee Monday.
   Metzenbaum cited a report by IDS Life Co. of Minneapolis
predicting that the loss of consumer confidence following the
failure of a prominent insurer ``could have a widespread effect on
the industry, with massive cash withdrawals induced by the
insolvency of one insurer leading to the insolvency of other, less
financially secure companies.''
   Albanese said Best ``would not support the dire conclusions
which have been reached regarding the potential insolvencies of
several large and prominent insurers in the event of unspecified
economic scenarios.''
   Metzenbaum called the hearing to explore whether the insurance
industry and policyholders are jeopardized by insurers' heavy
investment in high-risk junk bonds and commercial real estate that,
because of a slowing economy, has lost much of its value.
   Life insurance companies are said to hold about four times as
many junk bonds as S&amp;Ls did before scores of thrift institutions
collapsed in the late 1980s.
   Metzenbaum argued that lax state regulation allows insurers to
list the value of bonds and real estate as their purchase price,
rather than much lower current worth.
   Thomas H. Borman, Minnesota commerce commissioner, said state
regulators must learn from the mistakes of S&amp;L regulators and
require insurers to update the valuations of their holdings.
   ``This is yet another thinly disguised attempt to dupe the
public into believing that their security blanket is not in
jeopardy,'' Metzenbaum said. ``The insurance industry, and
particularly the life insurance industry, has enormous sums
invested in these troubled assets.''
   Terence Lennon, chief examiner of the New York Insurance
Department, questioned the logic of such a move unless an insurer's
liabilities - its promise to pay off on policies in the future -
also are revalued. Because of the wide variety of policies now
available, he said, that would be a mistake.
   Metzenbaum had asked six life insurance companies to testify at
the hearing. They declined, and the senator said their refusal
``sends a loud and clear message - they cannot stand the tough
scrutiny that the public demands and deserves.''
   The American Council of Life Insurance, which represents most
companies, was not allowed to testify but submitted a brief written
statement from President Richard S. Schweiker.
   Because life companies have liabilities that are long-term, they
match them with long-term assets - bonds, he said. Insurers list
those bonds at book value because changes in market interest rates
``have almost no impact on the ability of the bond issuer to meet
interest obligations or repay principal,'' Schweiker wrote.
   Metzenbaum is exploring whether the federal government should
take over some or all of the task of regulating the insurance
industry from the states.

   A fast-food kiddie club promises ``fun,
non-stop.'' Beer is billed as the beverage of choice on Halloween.
And a cigarette maker portrays itself as a patriotic defender of
freedom.
   Those are some of the advertisements an array of consumer,
environmental and health groups contended Monday are among the
year's ``most misleading, unfair or irresponsible.''
   The sixth annual ``Harlan Page Hubbard Lemon Awards'' honor the
legacy of the man who tirelessly promoted Lydia Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound as a remedy for ailments ranging from fatigue to cancer.
   Needless to say, the cure-all claim was pure quackery.
   The Center for Science in the Public Interest called Hubbard
``the first advertising executive to employ deceptive advertising
techniques on a national scale'' and said his spirit lives in the
commercials of today.
   The sponsors of the modern-day ads begged to differ. Those who
could be found said they stood firmly behind their products and
commercials.
   ``It's been wonderfully successful and lots of fun,'' Burger
King Corp. spokesman Cori Zywtow said of the chain's ``Kid's
Clubs'' program.
   Exactly how much fun was the question asked by Action for
Children's Television in nominating Burger King for a Hubbard.
   The ad promises ``fun, non-stop'' and shows groups of children
happily engaged in what are presumably club activities. But ACT
said they actually receive little more than a membership card and
some stickers.
   Zywtow said the 2.7 million members also get posters, a
newsletter and special meals. Does that constitute non-stop fun?
``It has been a terrific program,'' she replied. ``We're very proud
of it.''
   General Motors Corp. also took issue with its two citations by
the Center for Auto Safety and the Safe Energy Communication
Council.
   The safety center said GM misrepresented itself in one ad by
claiming that it ``pioneered the air bag.'' It said the company
fought government rules to require air bags and now equips fewer
models with them than Ford or Chrysler.
   The energy council denounced an ad touting the Cutlass Supreme
as fuel-efficient even though it gets lower mileage than most of
GM's other models.
   Gus Buenz, a spokesman for Oldsmobile, countered that GM had
airbags in cars as early as 1974 and has a strong tradition of
safety research.
   He said the Cutlass ad was meant to highlight the car's
roominess, price and responsiveness, as well as fuel economy. ``All
we're doing is telling people you can get all those things plus 30
mpg'' on the highway, Buenz said.
   Another double winner was Philip Morris Companies Inc., parent
of the cigarette maker. Its alleged lemons:
   -A Virginia Slims ad that, according to the National Women's
Health Network, implies a brand called ``Superslims'' can help
women stay thin.
   -A series of ads celebrating the Bill of Rights. The Coalition
on Smoking or Health accused the firm of appropriating one of the
country's most important documents ``for its own greedy purposes''
- namely the defeat of government restrictions on tobacco
promotion.
   Philip Morris spokesman Les Zuke said it was ``absurd'' to read
a weight pitch in the Superslims ad. He said the commercial ``makes
two claims: Superslims emits 70 percent less smoke from the lit end
and Superslims is an ultralight cigarette that tastes good.''
   The first nominee to a newly established ``Hubbard Hall of
Shame'' was a Volvo ad that showed a Volvo surviving as a truck
drove over its roof. The car had been specially reinforced during
production of the ad - a fact the company says it did not know
until after the spot aired.
   ``It was never Volvo's intention to deceive or mislead the
public,'' said spokesman Robert Austin. ``A mistake was made ... We
went out and told the public that with our own corrective
advertisement.''
   Among others receiving laurels for the year's worst ads:
   -Coors Brewing Co., for Coors Light ads that feature a haunted
house and the line that ``it isn't Halloween without the Silver
Bullet.'' ``Its appeal to children is chilling,'' said the National
Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence Inc.
   -Kellogg Co., for saying that protein in Special K cereal can
help women maintain healthy muscle tone while dieting. The Iowa
attorney general has alleged in federal court that the ads are
misleading, said the Center for Science in the Public Interest.
   Celeste Clark, vice president of nutrition marketing at Kellogg,
said Special K has been marketed as a high-protein cereal for 35
years. ``The ad campaign is not meant to indicate that Special K
alone can help you lose weight,'' she said.

<HEAD>Thompson Family To Relinquish Control Of Southland Corp.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The family that developed Southland Corp. from an
ice company into the nation's largest operator of convenience
stores will relinquish the control they have held for nearly 60
years as the company is restructured.
   Southland officials said Monday that officials from the Japanese
companies that would buy a majority of Southland's stock will
dominate the board and management, including Masatoshi Ito as
chairman.
   Ito would replace chairman John P. Thompson, son of the late Joe
C. Thompson, the patriarch who developed Southland.
   Ito is president of Ito-Yokado Group and chairman of 7-Eleven
Japan, the two companies that propose paying $430 million to buy 70
percent of Southland.
   Clark Matthews, Southland's chief financial officer, would
become the company's president and chief executive officer,
according to the plan filed Monday. He would replace Jere Thompson.
   Toshifumi Suzuki, Ito-Yokado executive vice president, would
become vice chairman of Southland's board.
   Monday's announcement confirmed speculation about a severely
reduced role for the Thompsons that followed Southland's first
proposals in March for a restructuring. In an offer revised several
times since then, Southland wants to exchange $1.8 billion in
expensive loans for less costly notes and sell control of the
company to the Japanese companies for the much-needed cash.
   Southland filed a prepackaged bankruptcy plan in October after
gaining approval from the company's major creditors. Southland
hopes to emerge from court protection within months.
   Each of the Thompson brothers - John, Jere and Joe C. - would
receive a $960,000 annual salary for five years under terms of the
reorganization plan.
   The retention of Matthews as a top managing officer at Southland
``underscores the confidence of our Japanese partners in the
current management of the company,'' Southland spokeswoman Cecilia
Norwood said Monday.
   John and Jere Thompson would remain members of Southland's board
as vice chairmen. In that role, they would remain actively involved
in strategic planning, Ms. Norwood said.
   The third brother, Joe C. Thompson, and Matthews also would
become company directors.
   Southland outlined its proposed management team, which depends
on confirmation of its restructuring plan by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Harold Abramson, in documents filed with the court Monday.
   The new Japanese owners would control 10 seats on Southland's
board of 15 to 17 members. The Thompsons directly control three
seats, indicating the Japanese approved the appointment of one of
the Thompsons or Matthews to the board.
   A committee that represents the company's bondholders would
appoint two other, unnamed board members.

<TEXT>
   The deficit in the broadest measure of foreign
trade widened sharply to $25.59 billion in the July-September
quarter, the worst showing since late last year, the government
reported today.
   The 13.9 percent jump in the deficit was blamed on the fallout
from the Persian Gulf crisis, which drove up the price Americans
pay for imported oil and also boosted the country's spending on
overseas military operations.
   The Commerce Department said the third quarter deficit in the
country's current account trade deficit compared to a $22.49
billion deficit in the second quarter. It was the widest imbalance
since a deficit of $26.69 billion in the October-December quarter
of last year.
   The improvement in the country's trade deficit had been the one
bright spot in a generally lackluster U.S. economy. Improving
export sales had provided more than half of overall growth this
year.
   However, analysts are now worried that a widening trade deficit
will be one more drag on an economy many believe is already in a
recession. They fear that if the gap between U.S. exports and
imports widens significantly it will worsen the severity of the
recession.
   The current account is the country's most important trade
statistic because it measures not only trade in merchandise but
also trade in services and investment flows between countries.
   The big deterioration in the third quarter came from a sharply
higher merchandise deficit, which climbed 28.9 percent to $29.75
billion, compared to a deficit of $23.10 billion in the second
quarter.
   More than one-half of the increase in imports stemmed from
higher petroleum prices following Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   The balance on investment earnings shifted into a surplus of
$2.46 billion, reflecting improved earnings by Americans on their
overseas investments. This had been in deficit by $1 billion in the
second quarter.
   The United States also ran a surplus in the services category of
$5.82 billion in the third quarter. This reflected a drop of 2.8
percent from the second quarter figure of $5.98 billion.
   Payments to foreigners on services increased to $27.8 billion,
up 7.3 percent from the second quarter. This reflected higher
travel and passenger fares paid by Americans to foreign airlines
and also higher direct defense spending because of the stationing
of U.S. troops in the Middle East.
   The other component of the current account, unilateral transfer
payments, primarily foreign aid payments and government pension
payments to Americans living overseas, increased the deficit by
$4.11 billion.
   The current account is the trade statistic that is most closely
watched by economists because it shows the amount of borrowing the
United States must do each quarter to finance the shortfall between
imports of goods, services and investments and exports in those
categories.
   A decade ago, America was the largest creditor nation. It ran
surpluses in its current account as the earnings from its overseas
investments were enough to offset perennial deficits in merchandise
trade.
   But as Americans handed over billions of dollars to foreigners
to pay for imported merchandise, the investment cushion eroded and
disappeared altogether in 1985 when the United States became a net
debtor for the first time in 71 years.
   That means that foreigners now own more in U.S. assets than
Americans own overseas, a development which has led some to fear
the country is losing control of its economic destiny to
foreigners.
   At the end of 1989, the country's net debtor position was put at
$663.7 billion, up a sharp 25 percent from the previous year.
Analysts believe that figure will grow by close to another $100
billion this year and will hit $1 trillion before it starts to
improve.

   As Armand Hammer built Occidental Petroleum
Corp. from nearly nothing to the nation's 16th largest industrial
corporation, his grip on the company was so tight that critics
called it a stranglehold.
   Today the question is whether his successor, Ray R. Irani, can
hold together a company long regarded as a natural takeover target,
worth far less as a whole than broken into its separate businesses:
oil and gas, chemicals, natural gas pipelines, pork and beef, coal.
   Occidental stock was up $2.25 at $23 per share in heavy trading
this morning on the New York Stock Exchange, after trading up about
the same amount in London today.
   Analysts and investors have watched Occidental with fascination
and often suspicion for decades, wondering how long Hammer could
last and who would try to replace him. Now, with his death Monday
at 92, they will find out.
   From 1970 to the mid-1980s, Hammer rid himself of at least 10
executives who had believed they were his corporate heir. The joke
was that so many people had occupied the Occidental president's
office that it should have a revolving door.
   In 1984, Irani was named president and chief operating officer.
In February of this year, Hammer anointed Irani his successor-to-be
as Occidental's chairman and chief executive.
   Among other things, Hammer praised Irani's leadership of
Occidental's chemical operations, which grew from a 1983 loss of
$38 million on sales of $1.7 billion to 1989 profits of more than
$1 billion on $5.2 billion in sales.
   The move was designed to calm the wild swings in stock price
that resulted from the merest rumors of ill health for Hammer, who
had a history of heart problems and received a pacemaker in
November 1989.
   It also clearly underlined that Irani was entirely in control of
day-to-day operations at Occidental.
   That point was an important one at a time when Hammer, after
seven decades as one of the world's most prominent businessmen,
increasingly showed signs of senility, often losing touch with
reality, according to associates who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   In declining to reveal details of those problems, Occidental
walked a fine line again with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, which requires disclosure of significant facts
affecting a publicly held company.

   Armand Hammer, the communist's son who became
an American captain of industry as well-connected in the Kremlin as
he was on Wall Street, has died at age 92.
   Hammer died at his home Monday night after a brief illness, said
Frank Ashley, a spokesman for Hammer's Occidental Petroleum Corp.
   Hammer, a self-made millionaire by the time he graduated from
Columbia University medical school at age 23, was also a
philanthropist, art collector and crusader for world peace.
   ``He was absolutely indomitable,'' said his attorney, Arthur
Groman. ``He never lost his courage or tenacity. In the last
months, he was uncomplaining and optimistic.''
   Hammer exhibited a flair for the dramatic until the end,
deciding to celebrate his bar mitzvah - which marks a Jewish boy's
13th birthday - at age 92. He died the night before the ceremony.
Hammer was born a Jew but his family did not follow religious
customs.
   ``We're going to go ahead with the event,'' said spokesman
Howard Bragman. ``He's done extraordinary things for the Jewish
people, and since (Tuesday) night is the first night of Hanukkah,
we think that a light in the Jewish community like Dr. Hammer who
did so much for Jewish freedom should be remembered.''
   Hammer - a global businessman who knew world leaders from
Vladimir Lenin to George Bush - negotiated deals with communist
countries such as China and the Soviet Union to develop resources.
For years, he urged American presidents to meet with their Soviet
counterparts and encouraged the reduction of nuclear weapons, so
the money could be diverted to agriculture and medicine.
   ``Mr. Hammer was associated with one of the most remarkable
pages of our relationship'' with the United States, Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said today in a condolence message.
``He met with Lenin and was very close in many ways to the Soviet
Union, and to Russia.''
   Hammer made several fortunes and gave huge sums to his favorite
causes, especially cancer research. ``The only reason I make money
is so I can give it away,'' he was fond of saying.
   After the Chernobyl nuclear accident in the Soviet Union, he
arranged visits by U.S. specialists in bone-marrow transplants,
which helped save radiation victims.
   His empire rested on Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum
Corp, which he bought for $100,000 in 1957 and turned into one of
the nation's largest industrial companies.
   Ray Irani, the company's president and chief operations officer,
succeeds Hammer as chairman. Hammer's death makes the company a
potential takeover target.
   His art collection is displayed at the Armand Hammer Museum of
Art and Culture, which opened last month.
   Shareholders sued claiming company money was squandered on the
museum. A settlement capped the company's contribution to it at
just under $100 million.
   Hammer was born in 1898 in New York City. His Russian-born
father, a doctor, was a founder of the American Communist Party.
   But Hammer was a staunch capitalist who would say to communists,
``I tell them ... that I don't think their system works. But that
doesn't keep us from doing business.''
   After World War I, Hammer went to medical school at night and
worked to bail out the family's struggling pharmaceutical firm.
   He turned the business into a million-dollar company, in part
because he was able to market tincture of ginger, sometimes used to
give an alcoholic kick to ginger ale during Prohibition.
   After the Bolshevik Revolution, Hammer worked out a deal to
trade surplus U.S. grain for Soviet products. Hammer became a
Soviet hero for helping ease food shortages in the embattled
country. Lenin licensed him as the sole representative of 38
leading American manufacturers.
   Hammer could not work with Josef Stalin and sold his enterprises
to the Soviet government.
   For the next 25 years, he was an art dealer, a cattle breeder in
New Jersey and a whiskey distiller in Kentucky.
   In 1940, he parlayed a $100,000 investment into $7.5 million by
making blended whiskey from potatoes.
   Hammer bought Occidental as a tax shelter when it was near
bankruptcy. Today the company boasts huge oil, natural gas, coal,
chemical and agribusiness operations.
   In 1975, Hammer was charged with making a secret $54,000
donation President Nixon's campaign fund.
   He pleaded guilty, was put on probation and fined $3,000 - and
began campaigning for a pardon, which President Bush gave him last
year.
   Hammer was married three times and is survived by one son,
Julian, by his first wife.
   Funeral arrangements were pending.

   Grain and soybean futures were mixed in early
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Trading was quiet in anticipation of the release later today of
the U.S. Agriculture Department's supply and demand report.
   The market was also anticipating a visit to Washington on
Wednesday of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Schevardnadze. There
was a belief the USDA will use the occasion to announce the award
of U.S. aid or the granting of export credits to the Soviets.
   ``The question (in the market) is the size of the credits,''
said Victor Lespinasse, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
``If it is a billion dollars it will be bearish for the market. If
it is a couple of billion (dollars) it would be bullish.''

   General Motors Corp. plans a 40 percent boost in
the number of minority-owned dealerships over the next three years,
the company announced today.
   The automaker plans an additional 76 minority-owned dealerships
by December 1993, GM President Lloyd Reuss and Tony March, chairman
of the 11-member GM Minority Dealer Advisory Council, said today.
   The company has 192 black, Hispanic and Asian dealers, making up
2 percent of its approximately 9,600 dealers.
   ``Increased minority participation in our dealerships is vital
to achieving GM's prime objective of the 1990s - satisfying car and
truck owners better than any other manufacturer,'' Reuss said in a
statement.
   The automaker has conducted a minority dealer-training program
since 1972. But one of GM's leading black dealers said the new
agreement went an important step further.
   ``There is no doubt in my mind about the commitment of Lloyd
Reuss and (GM Chairman) Bob Stempel,'' said March, a Buick dealer
from Hartford, Conn. ``We are talking about a commitment from the
largest corporation in the world.''
   ``Some people were pushing the idea'' of a separate target
figure for new black dealers, said another council member,
Chevrolet dealer Charles Harrell of Flat Rock. ``But we didn't want
to get into that kind of trap. We'll get our fair share.''
   GM intends to increase the number of minority dealers in cities
with relatively large minority populations, according to a GM
statement. Those cities include Detroit, where four black-owned GM
dealerships folded this year, leaving no black-owned GM franchises
in the metropolitan area.
   At Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp., minorities make up 5.7
percent and 2.5 percent, respectively, of dealer ranks.

has been called an ideal match. Remaining regulatory hurdles are
expected to delay completion of the merger until the second quarter
of 1991.
   ``It's a logical, natural, normal merger that should benefit
both companies,'' said Herschel Schostek, a Silver Springs, Md.,
telecommunications industry consultant. ``GTE brings capital.
Contel brings a nice operational system.''
   The deal calls for Contel shareholders to receive 1.27 shares of
GTE common stock for each share of Contel common stock. Contel
would become a wholly owned subsidiary of GTE, based in Stamford.
   Contel, which provides a broad range of telecommunications
products and services, had more than $3 billion in revenues last
year. GTE, the nation's largest independent phone company, had
revenues of $17.4 billion.
   Contel Chairman Charles Wohlstetter called the merger ``a
tax-free exchange for shares in a company that will be financially
stronger and more competitive and have greatly enhanced marketing
and technological resources.''
   The merger comes at a time of growth in the cellular phone
business. Joel D. Gross, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette in New York, said subscriber rates industrywide are up 50
percent this year.
   ``The cellular industry has a tremendous outlook over the next
five to 10 years,'' he said. ``It's been growing for some time -
it's not like a cyclical business.''

   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. said it will offer a
$100,000 reward to veteran employees under a new program that
analysts said was an attempt to keep other firms from robbing
workers the company has spent money on to train.
   Under the program announced Monday, brokers and other financial
consultants who remain with the company 10 years and meet other
requirements can collect the reward as early as the year 2001,
company executives said.
   ``We want to send a message that there are long-term positive
opportunities on Wall Street,'' said John L. Steffens, executive
vice president for the brokerage's private client division, during
a press conference to announce the program.
   However, analysts said Merrill Lynch's new reward for loyalty
could spur other brokerage firms to follow suit with similar
compensation systems in what could turn into a bidding war for
high-performance employees.
   ``I think they'll take up the torch in a modified way that could
become competitive,'' said Perrin Long, an analyst who follows the
securities industry for Lipper Analytical Securities Corp.
   For example, a competing company could offer loyal employees
$100,000 at the end of nine years instead of 10 years, he said.
   To be eligible for the $100,000 bonus, Merrill Lynch workers
must participate in a new training program designed to raise their
skills to a level company executives said will make them more
competitive in today's financial services environment.
   As part of the program, new hires will join an expanded two-year
training program where they must successfully complete courses
focusing on such subjects as money management, sales, client
service and product knowledge.
   However, Long said he was skeptical about the program's ability
to combat lucrative offers from competing firms for
high-performance brokers.
   Merrill Lynch's turnover rate is between 14 percent to 15
percent, according to the company.
   ``Even though someone's being promised $100,000, maybe at the
end of six years somebody else comes along and says we'll give you
$100,000-$150,000 up front,'' Long said.
   Merrill Lynch executives declined to discuss the cost of the
program. However, they said that productivity gains would more than
cover its price tag.
   ``If everybody made it (remained at Merrill Lynch) for the next
10 years, it would add several hundred million dollars to Merrill
Lynch's bottom line,'' said Steffens.
   All told, 10,500 domestic workers will be eligible for the
reward.
   Long estimated the two-year training program for new hires would
cost Merrill Lynch $40,000-$45,000 per employee, compared with
$25,000-$30,000 a worker for the previous program.

<HEAD>12 Electricity Shares Sprint Higher as Trading Starts</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS in 2nd graf that package is made up 1,000 shares and
CORRECTS its prices.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock in Britain's 12 newly privatized regional
electricity companies sprinted as much as 77.5 percent higher
Tuesday as they began trading on London's Stock Exchange.
   A mixed package of 1,000 of the 12 stocks jumped to 1,595
pounds, or $3,110, shortly after trading commenced at 2:30 p.m.
from a partly paid price of 1,000 pounds, or $1,950.
   The London market's overall volume was a robust 470.8 million
shares at mid-afternoon, more than twice the 230.7 million shares
traded by midday.
   Dealers said trading in the new stock was very busy, with
millions of shares quickly changing hands. The exchange extended
trading for 1{ hours until 6 p.m. Tuesday to handle the heavy
volume.
   Institutional investors were scrambling to get more stock after
the government scaled back their allocation because of strong
demand from the general public, dealers said.
   But some small investors were holding on to their stakes to take
advantage of the discounts on electricity bills and dividend
payments.
   The 5.18 billion pound, or $10.1 billion, sale of 2.16 billion
shares was 10.7 times oversubscribed, with personal investors
making 12.75 million applications.
   The general public is getting about 55 percent of the shares and
domestic institutional investors are getting 30 percent, with 15
percent going to foreign investors.
   The sheer number of applications also prompted the government to
reduce most allocations to 100 shares each.
   The immediate sharp rise in the shares' prices prompted
opposition Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock to accuse the
Conservative government in the House of Commons of swindling the
British public by selling a British asset at what he said was 3
billion pounds, or $5.9 billion, below its true value.
   Prime Minister John Major rejected the charge, saying the offer
provided value to shareholders.
   The shares were offered at 240 pence, or $4.68, each, payable in
three instalments. The first 100 pence, or $1.95, partial payment
was due on application.

   H.J. Heinz Co., a food processor and canner,
said Tuesday its second-quarter profits increased 11.5 percent
because of price increases and a weaker U.S. dollar.
   Heinz reported earnings of $139.8 million, or 52 cents a share,
on sales of $1.6 billion in the quarter ended Oct. 31. That
compared with earnings of $125.4 million, or 47 cents a share, on
sales of $1.5 billion in the same 1989 period.
   ``Despite the intense competitive environment in some of our
food categories in the U.S.A., we remain confident that we will
achieve satisfactory full-year growth and continue to build for
future growth in the 1990s,'' said Anthony J.F. O'Reilly, the
company's chairman, president and chief executive officer.
   Profits for the six months ending in October rose 12.3 percent
to $283 million, or $1.06 per share, from $251 million, or 95 cents
a share, in the same period in 1989. Sales rose to $3.2 billion
from $3 billion.

   Don't bank on it, but there's a possibility you
might have a sizeable refund coming from your mortgage lender, the
result of errors in computing your adjustable rate payments.
   While nobody knows the full extent of the computing errors, the
total is likely to be huge, even in the billions of dollars.
Refunding the money could become still another financial problem
for already shaky lenders.
   The first hint of errors came in the summer of 1989, when a
former employee of the Federal Savings &amp; Loan Insurance Corp.
studied portfolios of failed thrift institutions and found errors
in a large percentage of mortgage loans.
   Seeking to determine the scope of the problem, federal
regulators already have asked lending institutions to audit their
portfolios. Among these regulators were the Federal Reserve and the
Office of Thrift Supervision.
   Meanwhile, a recent report from the General Accounting Office
contains estimates that between 20 percent and 30 percent of all
adjustable rate mortgages might have been calculated incorrectly.
   For the most part, assumptions to date are that the
miscalculations were inadvertent rather than an attempt to defraud
customers. In fact, it is likely that some errors favor borrowers
rather than lenders.
   Why, then, have they occurred? Information to date suggests the
answer lies in the complexity of caculations. Why didn't customers
find the errors? For the same reason - complexity - that caused
lenders to make them.
   HSH Associates, which tracks rates at institutions around the
country and calls itself the nation's largest publisher of mortgage
information, says errors could involve wrong dates, wrong indexes,
and just poor arithmetic.
   Adjustable rate mortgages, or ARMS, are changed on a regular
basis by rises or declines in an independent index, such as the
``One-year Treasury Bill'' rate, or the ``Six-month Treasury Bill''
rate or the ``Eleventh District Cost of Funds.''
   Most ARMs, says HSH, add a margin or mark-up to the index at
each adjustment, which might occur at six months or a year. The
resulting sum is then rounded to the nearest one-eighth percent.
   Some errors are likely to occur at this point, but the
possibilities for further errors are myriad. Some adjustments, for
example, are limited up and down by caps that are written into the
loan contracts.
   HSH, which has produced a booklet for homeowners wishing to
check their ARMs, lists a few of the other possibilities for error:
   -The servicer, or company to which a borrower sends payments,
might select a monthly index value instead of a weekly one.
   -It might use the wrong date, and thus the wrong index value.
   -An incorrect margin might be added to the index value. In some
cases, the sum might not be rounded to the nearest one-eighth
percent.
   If the calculations are often too much for lenders and their
computers, how can a homeowner expect to do better? The task is
formidable, to be sure, and some people might automatically send
the job to an accountant.
   But, say the folks at HSH, it can be done by the homeowner with
access to a newspaper and, of course, their handly little booklet
and worksheet. It is available for $3 from HSH Associates, 1200
Route 23, Butler, N.J. 07405.
   They'll also calculate it for you if you tell them your current
interest rate and send them a copy of your note, rider or
disclosure, but it'll cost you $25.

<HEAD>Sagging Sales May End the Era of Transformers Toy Robots</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN SCHWARTZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PAWTUCKET, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After years of battling for control of
the universe, Transformers, those toy robots that can change form,
may have met their demise from sagging sales.
   Hasbro Inc., which made nearly $950 million selling Transformers
over the past seven years, is re-evaluating whether domestic demand
is strong enough to justify costly promotion, company spokesman
Wayne Charness said Tuesday.
   ``Certainly Transformers had a fantastic run, and we are going
to review whether the run continues or whether it goes away,'' he
said.
   Hasbro kept the heroic Autobots and the evil Decepticons going
for years by inventing and supplying weapons for both sides of the
Transformers battle. It also developed a complicated story line of
a futuristic mechanical being that crash-landed on earth in search
of fuel and power supplies.
   In its heyday in 1985, Transformers generated about $333 million
for Hasbro, accounting for 27 percent of the company's annual net
revenue. This year, the product is expected to garner only about
2.4 percent, or $35 million.
   Hasbro worldwide net sales should total about $1.46 billion this
year, up from about $1.41 billion last year, Gary M. Jacobson, toy
industry analyst for Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. of New York, told The
Providence Journal-Bulletin.
   Charness said such staples as GI Joe and Cabbage Patch Kids
dolls continue to be top sellers, along with new items such as New
Kids on the Block dolls and World Wrestling Federation figures.
   Transformers continue to sell well in other countries, where the
toys were introduced more recently, Charness said. A decision on
the future of Transformers in this country should be made shortly,
he said.
   ``With any product you'd love to have it last forever and
ever,'' he said. ``Our job (is) ... to give it as long a life as it
can.''
   If Hasbro decides to discontinue U.S. sales of Transformers, it
will end one of the toy industry's biggest success stories in
years.
   ``It had a terrific run,'' said Paul H. Valentine, a toy
industry analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. of New York. ``It was
one of the major hits of the 1980s.''
   Another toy industry analyst, Sean McGowan of Gerard Klauer
Mattison &amp; Co. of New York, said: ``The question of Transformers is
not, `Why did it die?' but, `Why did it live so long?'''
   The answer lies, at least in part, in Hasbro's marketing
strategy. The Pawtucket-based company constantly updated the line
with new figures and vehicles. It offered various models to appeal
to different pocketbooks. And there was a Transformers television
cartoon show and a movie.
   Over the years, Hasbro became less aggressive about marketing
the figures.
   ``We certainly continued to support Transformers but not at the
level we did when it was the most popular toy in the country,''
Charness said.
   The line of toy robots first arrived in 1983 when it was
unveiled at the annual toy fair in New York City by the Japanese
toy company, Takara.
   While Hasbro worked out a licensing arrangement with Takara,
Tonka Corp. of Minnetonka, Minn., introduced a competing line,
GoBots, in early 1984.
   ``Although Transformers appeared five months after GoBots,
Hasbro came from behind and outsold GoBots almost 2 to 1,''
according to the book ``Toyland: The High Stakes Game of the Toy
Industry.''
   Transformers generated about $111.6 million in sales that year.
   ``I think it really brought a fun new play to toys,'' said
Charness. ``The whole transformation theme - it was an exciting one
for kids, and I think done well it continues to be.''

   A judge set an April 17 trial Tuesday on
whether a new state law requires Philip Morris Co. to post
no-smoking signs in the gift shop at its tobacco plant.
   A lawsuit filed by Virginia Group to Alleviate Smoking in Public
alleges that the tobacco giant is violating the law that requires
no-smoking signs in indoor cashier lines. The maximum penalty is a
$25 fine.
   Lonnie D. Nunley III, an attorney for Philip Morris, told
Richmond General District Judge Walter Stout the company would
contest the suit. The judge then set the trial date.
   Robert Moore, a Philip Morris spokesman, has called the lawsuit
a frivolous publicity stunt and said the company has no plans to
post signs.
   This is Virginia GASP's second lawsuit against Philip Morris
over the alleged violation. The first complaint was dismissed last
month on a technicality.
   Anne Morrow Donley, executive director of Virginia GASP, said
her battle with Philip Morris shows the state law that took effect
in July is difficult to enforce.
   ``It's very ridiculous for a person to have to report a
violation of the law by going to court time after time,'' she said.

<HEAD>GM to Boost Minority Dealers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. is planning to boost the
number of dealerships owned by minority group members by 40 percent
in three years and find ways to hang on to the 192 it already has,
the company said Tuesday.
   ``Increased minority participation in our dealerships is vital
to achieving GM's prime objective of the 1990s, satisfying car and
truck owners,'' said a statement by GM President Lloyd Reuss.
   Currently, about 2 percent of GM's 9,600 dealers are members of
minority groups, including blacks, Hispanics and Asians. GM hopes
to raise that number to 2.8 percent, or 268 dealerships, by 1993,
said the statement by Reuss and Tony March, a Buick dealer from
Hartford, Conn., and chairman of the GM Minority Dealer Advisory
Council.
   About 5.7 percent of Ford Motor Co.'s 5,500 dealers are members
of minority groups and about 2.5 percent of Chrysler Corp.'s 5,300
dealers are from minority groups.
   GM has had a dealer training program for minority groups since
1972, but this is the first time a target has been set. The goal
was set Friday when Reuss and March signed an agreement.
   ``There is no doubt in my mind about the commitment of Lloyd
Reuss and (GM Chairman) Bob Stempel,'' March said. ``We are talking
about a commitment from the largest corporation in the world.''
   In addition to adding to the minority dealer ratio, a steering
committee of the dealer organizations will look at ways to help
dealers from minority groups stay in business.
   Black-owned, inner-city dealerships are especially vulnerable to
economic downturns, such as the one the auto industry currently is
experiencing.
   In 1988, there were 114 black-owned GM dealerships, a number
that has shrunk to 83 lately. Four black-owned GM dealerships have
folded in metropolitan Detroit in the past year.

<HEAD>Electricity Shares Surge As Much as 66 Percent</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shares in Britain's 12 regional electricity
companies surged as much as 66 percent on their first day of
trading Tuesday, prompting opponents to accuse the government of
selling the industry off too cheaply.
   Prime Minister John Major rejected the charge, and called the
$10 billion privatization the most popular in the government's
decade-old program. It's also the biggest and most complex.
   A package of 1,000 of the 12 stocks jumped to 1,578 pounds, or
$3,061, by the close of trading from an opening price of 1,000
pounds, or $1,940.
   One company's shares, Manweb's, soared to 166 pence, or $3.24,
from its opening price of 100 pence, or $1.94. The smallest gain,
by two companies, was 42 pence, or 81 cents.
   Frantic trading in the electricity shares almost trebled the
London market's overall volume to 825.5 million shares from 317
million shares Monday. The exchange extended trading for 90 minutes
to handle the heavy volume.
   Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock accused the Conservative
government of selling a British asset at what he said was less than
half its true value.
   ``The British people are being subjected to a national scandal
and by a great swindle by their own government,'' he said in the
House of Commons. ``Any government that inflicts that on its own
people is guilty either of infamous incompetence or of great
dishonesty, or both.''
   Major disputed the charge, saying the offer provided value to
shareholders. ``The offer has been a huge success, clearly the most
successful ever,'' he said.
   Pricing a privatization is a tricky business. The government
tries to raise as much revenue as it can, while pricing the shares
cheaply enough to attract investors without creating a political
storm.
   The latest pricing was complicated by the uncertainty over the
Persian Gulf crisis and generally bearish market conditions.
   Privatization shares generally have spurted on their first day
of trading. That's partly because underwriters insist that the
shares be priced so that they get an instant 10 percent premium,
said John Wilson, an analyst with the London investment firm UBS
Phillips and Drew.
   ``There's no doubt about it, the (electricity shares are) at the
slightly high end of expectations,'' Wilson said. ``But I certainly
wouldn't say it's been floated off cheaply.''
   The gains are not as large as they seem at first glance because
they come on stock that is being bought with installment payments,
and because dealing costs have to be taken into account.
   The shares were offered at 240 pence each, or $4.66, payable in
three installments. The first 100 pence payment was due on
application.
   There was heightened demand for the shares, however. The sale of
2.16 billion shares was more than 10 times oversubscribed,
prompting the government to scale back allocations to institutional
investors.
   Tuesday's rise in prices reflected a scramble among those
investors to get more stock, analysts said.
   At the same time, some small investors were holding on to their
stakes to take advantage of the government's enticements of
electricity bill vouchers and dividends.
   That meant demand far exceeded supply, and market makers had to
price the shares at levels high enough to entice institutional
investors to sell.

<HEAD>Businessman Pleads Guilty to Illegally Using Advance Magazine
Copies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A businessman pleaded guilty to federal
charges that he made illegal stock deals based on information from
advance copies of Business Week magazine.
   Stephen R. Rasinski, who entered his plea Monday, faces up to 10
years in prison and a $500,000 fine when he is sentenced April 8 in
U.S. District Court.
   In a complaint filed last month, the Securities and Exchange
Commission said Rasinski, 35, traded on information gleaned from
Business Week's ``Inside Wall Street'' column.
   The complaint contended the Newport Beach businessman obtained
early copies of Business Week from an employee of Torrance-based
R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co., which prints the magazine.
   Stocks receiving favorable mention in the magazine column would
be purchased by Rasinski's broker one day before the magazine was
made public, the SEC said.
   The broker, John Petit of Newport Beach, settled charges by the
SEC in November and agreed to repay $195,229. He also pleaded
guilty to two counts of insider trading.
   Shayne A. Walters, a Donnelley salesman, pleaded guilty in New
York to perjury and conspiracy to commit securities, wire and mail
fraud for supplying Rasinski with advance copies of the magazine.
He was awaiting sentencing.
   Rasinski was the 12th person charged by the SEC with trading on
information from advance copies of Business Week. He is the third
to plead guilty to criminal charges.

   Share prices on the London Stock Exchange fell
Tuesday in a session extended by 90 minutes to accommodate trading
in the 12 newly privatized electricity companies.
   The session was one of the most hectic in recent memory, dealers
said.
   The electricity shares rose sharply from their opening price of
100 pence. The issue of 2.16 billion shares in Britain's
electricity distribution companies had been 10.7 times
oversubscribed.
   At the closing bell, the broad-based Financial Time 100-share
index was down 16.7 points, or 0.77 percent, at 2,165.8.
   The narrower Financial Times 30-share index was down 15.5 points
at 1,706.0. The Financial Times 500-share index was down 7.64 at
1,144.87.
   Volume registered a robust 825.5 million shares, almost three
times the 317.0 million shares traded a day ago. The large turnover
reflected the vigorous demand for the electricity shares.

<TEXT>
   Industrialist Armand Hammer was remembered
Tuesday as a tireless crusader for international peace who improved
the human condition by investing millions in education, medicine
and the arts.
   The flamboyant, globe-trotting chairman of Occidental Petroleum
Corp., the nation's 16th largest industrial company, died Monday at
his home in the Westwood district late Monday following a brief
illness. He was 92.
   The cause of death was not revealed, although associates said
privately Hammer had been suffering from kidney problems. He died
just one day before a planned celebration for his belated bar
mitzvah.
   Slammed by critics as a self-promoter more concerned with his
image than corporate leadership, Hammer nonetheless drew praise
from heads of state and leaders in business and education. He met
with every Soviet leader.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Hammer helped forge
Soviet-American relations.
   ``Mr. Hammer was associated with one of the most remarkable
pages of ur relationship,'' Gorbachev said. ``He met with Lenin
and was very close in many ways to the Soviet Union, and to
Russia.''
   Hammer, whose father helped found the American Communist Party,
became a millionaire by age 23 and by most estimates died a
billionaire.
   Hammer bought the then-ailing Occidental for $100,000 in 1957 as
a tax shelter, and turned it into an international giant, It 1989
income was $285 million on sales of $20.07 billion. Occidental's
core businesses are oil and gas, chemicals, natural gas pipelines,
pork and beef, and coal.
   Ray R. Irani, Occidental's president and chief operating
officer, immediately succeeded Hammer as chairman and chief
executive.
   But Hammer's death sparked speculation that Occidental, long
beholden to his occasionally whimsical management style, might
change its corporate agenda.
   Warren Shimmerlik, an independent energy analyst, said under
Irani's management Occidental was likely to undergo significant
restructuring.
   ``Hammer's style prevented a rationalization that would be
beneficial to the company,'' Shimmerlik said, noting Hammer
preferred to position Occidental as an income-producing stock
rather than a growth company. ``There didn't seem to be any real
momentum in the company.''
   At times, Hammer's craving for power and publicity threatened to
overshadow his achievements in business, philanthropy and the arts.
   Hammer exhibited a flair for the dramatic until the end of his
life, deciding to celebrate his Jewish bar mitzvah manhood rite -
normally celebrated at age 13 - at 92.
   The ceremony, set for Tuesday night, was changed into a memorial
service.
   ``We're going to go ahead with the event,'' event spokesman
Howard Bragman said. ``It's really the wish of Dr. Hammer that this
event continue because it was important to him.''
   Funeral arrangements were pending. Hammer will be entombed in
the private Hammer Family mausoleum at Westwood Village Cemetery,
just a few hundred yards from Occidental Petroleum headquarters and
his new art museum.
   Hammer was born on May 21, 1898, in New York City. His
Russian-born father sent Armand off at age 10 to live with a
socialist colleague.
   After World War I, Hammer went to Columbia University College of
Physicians and Surgeons, working at night to bail out the family's
struggling pharmaceutical firm. He turned the business into a
million-dollar company.
   While waiting to begin his medical internship, Hammer read about
a typhus epidemic in the new Soviet Union. He went to Russia where
he quickly learned the Soviets needed food more than doctors.
   Hammer told Soviet officials, ``I'll bring over ships filled
with grain if you will fill them with products I can sell in
America.''
   During a life of wheeling and dealing he was on a first-name
basis with world leaders from Vladimir Lenin to George Bush.
   He personally negotiated most of Occidental's deals, including a
$3 billion oil, gas, fertilizer and hotels pact with the Soviets in
1972 and a $640 million partnership with China in 1984 to develop
the world's largest open-pit coal mine.
   He made several fortunes and donated huge sums to charity. ``The
only reason I make money is so I can give it away,'' Hammer was
fond of saying.
   After the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster, he helped American
doctors go to the Soviet Union to help with bone-marrow
transplants.
   ``He was able to get a hold of people in Moscow on a weekend and
tell them that we were coming to help them,'' said one of the
surgeons, Dr. Robert Gale. ``He was a very good friend.''
   Hammer flew one time ``Prisoner of Zion'' Ida Nudel from Moscow
to Tel Aviv in October 1987 and escorted Ben Charny, who had a
tumor in his neck, from the Soviet Union to a Boston hospital in
July 1988, said Rick Jacobs, Occidental vice president and Hammer's
personal assistant for more than seven years.
   ``He was trusted by the Soviet, the American and the Israeli
leadership,'' Jacobs said.
   He gave millions of dollars to cancer research, and President
Reagan named him chairman of the President's Cancer Panel.
   Hammer also was an avid art collector. His collection, including
works from five centuries of European paintings and a Leonardo da
Vinci notebook, is displayed at the Armand Hammer Museum of Art and
Culture, which opened in November 1990 beside Occidental's
headquarters.
   In 1975, Hammer was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges
of making a secret $54,000 donation to the campaign of former
President Nixon.
   He pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges, was fined $3,000 and
placed on one year's probation. President Bush pardoned him in 1989
for the Watergate-era crime.
   Hammer was married three times and is survived by one son,
Julian, by his first wife.

<TEXT>
   It has been a rough year for OPEC oil
ministers.
   Six of the 13 nations belonging to the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries have switched ministers in the past year.
   A seventh still has the same name on the roster but he hasn't
been seen at a cartel meeting for quite a while.
   OPEC veterans cannot remember a year when there ave been so
many new faces.
   The change attracting the most attention occurred in Iraq.
   Last October, President Saddam Hussein abruptly fired Issam
Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi, a respected oil minister who had held the
job since March 1987. Al-Chalabi was dismissed shortly after a fuel
rationing program was imposed in that crisis-ridden country. The
rationing program was later cancelled, with the government saying
it was put in place by mistake.
   Al-Chalabi was replaced by Saddam's son-in-law, Hussein Kamel,
who also is minister of industry and military industrialization.
   Kamel did not show up at OPEC's winter meeting. Instead, the
delegation was led by Ramzi Salman Abdul Hussain, director of the
State Oil Marketing Organization, who was scheduled to take over as
OPEC's deputy secretary-general next year.
   Another veteran dropped from the roster was Mana Saeed Otaiba of
the United Arab Emirates, who had been attending OPEC meetings
since 1971. Yousef Omeir bin Yousef was named the new oil minister
in a Cabinet reshuffle in the oil-rich confederation.
   Libya also sent a new name. Abdullah Salem al-Badri was head of
the delegation instead of Fawzi Shakshuki, that nation's oil
minister since October 1984.
   Kuwait changed ministers last July. Sheikh Ali Khalifa al-Sabah,
one of the more colorful OPEC ministers, was replaced by Rasheed
Salem al-Ameeri.
   Al-Sabah, who had been oil minister since February 1978,
retained his title as finance minister and popped up at an OPEC
meeting in Geneva in late August, the first held after Iraq invaded
his country.
   Nigeria began the cartel's musical chairs last December when it
named Rilwanu Lukman, then-OPEC president, as its foreign minister.
Jibril Aminu, a physician, was given the job of oil minister.
   In Gabon, Julien M'Pouho-Epigat was replaced last April by Jean
Ping.
   In Qatar, Abdul Aziz bin Khalifa al-Thani was still listed as
the nation's petroleum minister. But his brother, Interior Minister
Abdullah bin Khalifa al-Thani, has been seen more at cartel
meetings over the past year.
   Still holding onto their jobs at year's end were ministers in
Algeria, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Ecuador and Iran.

   The stock market fell today, with losses among
high-tech issues helping to erase Monday's modest gains.
   Analyst Jack Solomon at Bear Stearns &amp; Co. said high-tech stocks
were down on a disappointing report on orders and shipments for
computer chips as well as discouraging overviews taken by some
computer industry analysts.
   ``This whole high-tech area has suddenly been punctured, and
that puts a damper on the market,'' Solomon said.
   Other analysts said the market seemed to be showing a technical
weakness, because it fell at the same time oil prices and interest
rates were dropping. In other recent sessions, that might have
pushed stocks higher.

<HEAD>Assembly Adopts Curbs on Alcohol, Tobacco Advertising</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The French National Assembly adopted strict curbs
Tuesday on advertising for tobacco and alcoholic beverages over
objections from winegrowers and sports promoters.
   The Assembly adopted a text worked out by a joint group of
Assembly deputies and members of the Senate. The approved text will
now go to the upper chamber for consideration.
   The law forbids all forms of direct or indirect tobacco
advertising beginning Jan. 1, 1993 and orders steep hikes in the
price of cigarettes.
   It is less severe on alcohol, taking into account the concerns
of senators from winegrowing regions who caused stiffer measures to
be rejected in an earlier bill in October.
   The revised version permits advertising in wine-producing
regions, in the written press aimed at adults, and in certain radio
broadcasts.
   Senators on the joint committee expressed confidence the
proposal will pass their chamber later this month.
   Sponsorship by alcoholic beverage or tobacco companies in sports
and other events will be strictly forbidden.
   Health Minister Claude Evin, who has pushed the advertising
restrictions for a year, calls such tobacco or alcohol sponsorship
``advertising in disguise.''
   The measures irritated Jean-Marie Balestre, president of the
International Federation of Auto Sports. The motor racing industry
is heavily dependent on tobacco sponsorship.
   ``There is too much hypocrisy in these measures,'' he declared
Monday during an awards ceremony. ``There are other much more
dangerous scourges, like drugs.''
   Some deputies who voted against the bill Tuesday remarked that
the way to cure alcohol or tobacco abuse lay in better education.
Others said it would cause unemployment in wine-producing areas.
   Evin says the law is necessary to bring down consumption of
tobacco and alcohol by young French people and has praised the
success of anti-tobacco campaigns in the United States.

<HEAD>Milken Figure Barred From Securities Business</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A key figure in the prosecution of junk bond
king Michael Milken agreed Tuesday to be barred from the securities
business to settle an action brought by federal regulators.
   In settling the Securities and Exchange Commission
administrative proceeding - without admitting or denying wrongdoing
- David A. Solomon agreed to the revocation of his registration as
an investment adviser.
   Late last month, Solomon agreed to pay $7.9 million to settle
charges in federal court in New York of insider trading, income tax
fraud and other violations involving Milken.
   Some of the charges against Solomon, a former California money
manager, were central to the guilty plea of Milken, the former head
of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s junk bond department.
   Milken was sentenced last month to 10 years in prison.
   Solomon, 46, was granted immunity from criminal prosecution in
exchange for providing information against Milken. Solomon also
settled SEC civil charges without admitting or denying guilt.
   Under that settlement, Solomon agreed to return $7.3 million in
alleged illegal profits - $588,870 for insider trading and about
$6.7 million for other violations. The money is to be placed into
two funds to compensate wronged investors. Solomon also must pay
$661,674 in civil insider trading penalties.
   The 46-year-old former head of Solomon Asset Management Inc. was
one of Milken's biggest buyers of risky and often lucrative
high-yield bonds. The two had a relationship dating to the early
1970s.
   As part of Tuesday's settlement, Solomon will be barred from
associating with any securities broker, dealer investment adviser
or investment company.

<HEAD>Gold Gives Up Most of Monday's Gains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices retreated Tuesday on New York's Commodity
Exchange, erasing most of the gains made in the previous day's
trading.
   On other markets, energy futures fell; grains and soybean
futures were mostly lower; livestock and pork futures were mixed;
and coffee futures soared.
   Gold's losses came on reports the German Bundesbank would sell 1
billion marks of gold to help finance reunification. Following the
Bundesbank's denial of the report, the market rallied, but fell as
energy prices retreated.
   John Steel, an analyst with Refco Inc. in New York, said the
call before the start of trading Tuesday was for gold to move
higher in follow-through buying from Monday's strong showing. But
the rumor of German selling put a damper on that.
   ``The market jumped on the idea that the Germans were going to
sell gold,'' Steel said. ``The story was flimsy. Anyone who knows
about gold knows that governments seldom, if ever, sell their gold
reserves.''
   Also helping to push gold lower was the strength shown by the
dollar against foreign currencies.
   Gold settled $2.10 to $2.30 lower with the contract for delivery
in February at $373.60 a troy ounce; silver was 1.5 cents to 1.7
cents lower with December at $4.067 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures were lower in quiet trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange as traders consolidated their holdings in
anticipation of the release of American Petroleum Institute
inventory figures.
   Also sending the market lower was an announcement by Venezuela
that it plans to boost crude oil output by 44 percent over the next
six years.
   Concern also existed in the market over what will come out of
Wednesday's scheduled Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
meeting in Vienna, said Ron Caples, an analyst with Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc. in New York.
   Light sweet crude was 49 cents to 64 cents lower with January at
$26.41 a barrel; heating oil was 1.08 cents to 3.29 cents lower
with January at 77.68 a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 94 cent to
1.25 cent lower with January at 66.79 cents a gallon; natural gas
was .015 cent to .070 cent lower with July at $2.285 per thousand
cubic feet.
   Grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower in lackluster
trading on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   There was little news to spur trading, as most were
consolidating their holdings in anticipation of the release Tuesday
of the U.S. Agriculture Department's supply and demand report.
   Traders also were awaiting Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Schevardnadze's visit to Washington Wednesday, said Dan Cekander,
an analyst with Rodman &amp; Renshaw Inc. in Chicago. There is a belief
the USDA will use the occasion to announce the award of U.S. aid or
the granting of export credits to the Soviets.
   Wheat futures, while lower, received some support from news that
China has been targeted with 1.5 million metric tons of export
bonus wheat.
   Wheat was 1{ cents lower to 1\ cents higher with the contract
for delivery in December at $2.54{ a bushel; corn was a { cent to
1{ cents higher with December at $2.27\ a bushel; oats were a {
cent lower to a { cent higher with December at $1.10} a bushel;
soybeans were 1\ cent lower to 1{ cents higher with January at
$5.94 a bushel.
   Coffee futures soared on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa
Exchange.
   Strong European demand for Central American coffees, coupled
with those countries' reluctance to sell, helped boost prices.
   Also helping to lift prices is labor uncertainty in Colombia.
Workers at Barranquilla, Cartagena, Santa Marta and Buenaventura
are threatening to strike to protest government plans to privatize
ports.
   Coffee was 1.80 cents to 2.60 cents higher with December at 91
cents a pound.
   Livestock futures were mixed in trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .10 cent to .18 cent higher with December at
80.72 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .35 cent lower to .25 cent
higher with January at 88.72 cents a pound; live hogs were .18 cent
lower to .05 cent higher with December at 49.85 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .05 cent lower to .18 cent higher with
February at 66.65 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises on Plans to Halt its Decline; Gold Mostly Lower</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar strengthened against major foreign
currencies on Tuesday largely on news that the major industrialized
nations planned to meet to halt its decline.
   Gold prices were mostly lower.
   Foreign exchange dealers were warmed by news that the so-called
G-7 group of industrialized nations - the United States, Germany,
Japan, France, Britain, Italy and Canada - would meet in January to
consider the dollar's decline.
   ``People are presuming with a capital `P' that the outcome will
be possibly an attempt to stabilize the dollar,'' said Robert
Hatcher, corporate foreign exchange dealer for Barclays Bank PLC.
   Analysts said the dollar also was supported by a weakening of
the German mark after that nation's central bank announced it
wasn't planning to raise interest rates on Thursday.
   Traders had speculated that Bundesbank would tighten its credit
policy, which could have buoyed the mark against foreign
currencies.
   The two events combined to bounce the dollar off earlier lows,
analysts said.
   Within two hours Tuesday morning, the dollar jumped in value
from 1.4680 German marks to 1.4810. Much of those gains were
sustained, with the dollar closing u 1.4784 German marks, compared
to 1.4725 late Monday.
   ``Basically the situation with the dollar was pretty much a
complete turn-around from the morning,'' Hatcher said.
   The dollar gained ground against the Japanese yen in New York,
closing at 132.40 yen, up from 132.15 yen late Monday. In Tokyo,
the dollar rose to a closing 131.75 Japanese yen from 130.55 yen at
Monday's close, and in London, it was quoted at a higher rate of
131.95 yen.
   The British pound weakened to $1.9380 in New York, compared to
$1.9442 at Monday's close, and in London, it fell to $1.9400 from
$1.9450 late Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
prices, included: 1.2650 Swiss francs, up from 1.2615; 5.0190
French francs, up from 5.0050; 1,114.00 Italian lire, up from

   General Motors Corp. on Tuesday announced
formation of a new GM Powertrain Division to coordinate activities
of its new Engine Division and the Hydra-matic Division.
   The move, said GM President Lloyd Reuss, was designed to
consolidate major engine and transmission operations into one
operation. The GM Engine Division was formed last year to
coordinate engine research and development for all GM car and truck
divisions.
   The Powertrain Division will be headed by general manager
Richard Donnelly. He joined GM in 1961 and rose through its
manufacturing and product planning operations to become general
manager of the Engine Division.

   A veteran pilot and executive for Pan American
World Airways has joined Eastern Airlines as its president and
chief operating officer, the company said.
   Robert L. Gould was appointed Monday by Eastern's
court-appointed trustee Martin R. Shugrue, also a former Pan Am
pilot and executive.
   ``The arrival of Bob Gould at Eastern Airlines represents a
significant step in our reorganization efforts and demonstrates
that Eastern is now turning its attention to long-term operational
issues rather than short-term survival issues,'' Shugrue said.
   When Shugrue was appointed by the bankruptcy court to run in
Eastern in April, company president Phil Bakes handed in his
resignation, and Joseph Leonard resigned last month as chief
operating officer.
   Gould left Pan Am as senior vice president for operations, with
responsibility for maintenance and engineering, logistics,
inventory management, flight operations, purchasing, system control
and environmental affairs.
   He joined Pan Am as a pilot in 1965 and was elected to head the
carrier's pilots union in 1982. He helped structure and implement
an employees stock ownership plan and was given a seat on Pan Am's
board of directors.
   Gould joined management in 1986 as senior vice president for
airline and strategic planning.
   Eastern filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in March
1989.

   Crude oil prices fell Tuesday in light trading
as concerns of overproduction by OPEC nations created some
pessimism in the market.
   Traders said there was little news from the Middle East to
influence the market. They said an unconfirmed British broadcast
report that Iraq and the United States planned to negotiate
initially sent prices lower.
   Light sweet crude oil for January delivery settled down 49 cents
per barrel at $26.41. Later contract months for crude delivery also
fell modestly.
   Crude was down as much as $1.28 a barrel in morning trading
before rebounding. Traders attributed much of the gain to buying in
order to pay back so-called ``short'' positions on borrowed
contracts.
   Market professionals said traders are reluctant to stake out
positions because they do not want to jeopardize reducing profits
near the end of the year.
   Prices were affected in part by a call by Iran's oil minister on
Tuesday to cap OPEC production to help bolster prices.
   ``In view of the situation in the oil markets at the moment, I
am worried about the production figure,'' Iranian Oil Minister
Gholamreza Aqazadeh said before a meeting of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna.
   A glut of crude oil would reduce prices on world markets.
   ``If anything, people are focusing a little bit more on
(reports) that production levels are extremely high, considering
Iraq and Kuwait (supplies) aren't in there,'' said Christian
Gohler, a broker with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures. ``It's making
people focus on potentially bearish fundamentals down the road.''
   Futures prices for refined petroleum products also fell Tuesday.
   Home heating oil futures tumbled 3.29 cents to 77.68 cents a
gallon on the January contract after rising 1.80 cents to 80.97
cents a gallon Monday.
   Unleaded gasoline prices settled lower. The contract for
delivery in January declined .94 cent a gallon to 66.79 cents after
rising 1.26 cents Monday.
   The January contract for delivery of natural gas, which is not
directly affected by fears of war in the Middle East, dropped .70
cent to $2.285 per 1,000 cubic feet after falling .50 cent Monday.
   After the market closed, the American Petroleum Institute
reported that U.S. crude oil inventories fell moderately in the
week ended Friday to 332.1 million barrels from 335.5 million
barrels the previous week. A year ago, domestic crude oil
inventories totaled 343.7 million barrels.
   Imports of crude oil fell to 4.8 million barrels a day from 4.9
million a week earlier. A year earlier, before imports were
affected by the gulf crisis, they were 5.7 million barrels daily.
   The API also reported that gasoline inventories rose marginally
in the most recent week, to 221.7 million barrels from 221.1
million. Petroleum distillates - mainly heating oil and diesel fuel
- increased to 133.4 million barrels from 132.9 million barrels a
week earlier. A year earlier, inventories were 118.5 million
barrels.

<HEAD>Ames Reports $183.2 Million Third-Quarter Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCKY HILL, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ames Department Stores Inc., struggling
to emerge from Chapter 11 proceedings, reported Tuesday that is
third-quarter loss widened from a year earlier.
   The discount retailer reported a loss of $183.2 million,
attributed the poor results to restructuring charges of $129
million and difficulty selling the leases for more than 200 stores
it closed under its reorganization plan.
   The loss, which amounted to $4.97 a share, compared to a
restated loss of $1.6 million, or 13 cents a share, for the same
period a year ago.
   Ames reported third-quarter sales of $740.2 million, 9.2 percent
lower than adjusted 1989 third-quarter sales of $838.3 million.
   Last year's results did not include sales from the 221 stores
Ames closed after it filed for protection from its creditors in
April.
   ``The loss, before the restructuring charge, was much less than
anticipated, while sales exceeded our expectations,'' Stephen L.
Pistner, Ames chief executive, said in a statement. ``Third-quarter
results showed improvement as the stores' merchandise levels began
returning to normal and advertising was resumed and intensified.''
   A soft real estate market and tight credit resulted in lower
than expected sales of leases for many of the stores that Ames
closed during the second quarter, the retailer said.
   Pistner, considered a whiz at turning around ailing retailers,
was hired to steer the company away from the brink of financial
collapse.
   Ames filed for bankruptcy court protection from its creditors in
April when sales at its 680 stores dropped by 40 percent in a
3{-month period. The company has closed more than 200 stores and
consolidated some of its other operations.
   Pistner said Ames was making progress in stabilizing its
finances, noting its seasonal borrowing was repaid ahead of
schedule.
   Ames operates 461 discount department stores in 17 northeastern
states.
   For the first nine months of the fiscal year, Ames reported a
loss of $766.7 million, or $20.67 per share, compared to a loss of
$29.2 million, or $1.02 per share, in the same period of 1989.
   The 1990 results include $354 million in restructuring charges.
   Sales for the period totaled $2.16 billion, compared to $3.39
billion a year earlier. The 1989 figure includes sales from the
closed stores.

<TEXT>
   The tobacco industry, which manufactures
billions of cigarettes a year, said Tuesday it wants to keep
children from lighting up.
   ``We want to protect children from making decisions that they
are not capable of,'' Tobacco Institute vice president Brennan M.
Dawson said at a news conference announcing a campaign to keep
cigarettes away from anyone under 18.
   ``If a child never picks up another cigarette it would be fine
with the tobacco industry,'' Dawson said.
   But Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan, the Bush
administration's crusader against smoking, said the industry's
plans ``represent little more than a smoke screen to camouflage
their own marketing activities.''
   ``The cigarette industry spent $3.3 billion in 1988 to advertise
and promote cigarettes, or about $100 per second,'' Sullivan said.
``Much of that advertising reaches young people and lures them into
this deadly addiction.''
   Dawson said the campaign would support state laws limiting
cigarette sales to adults and would put new limitations on
billboard and other tobacco advertising and distribute a parent's
guide on how to discourage children from smoking.
   However, she said the guidelines won't prevent cigarette
companies from continuing to sponsor sporting events, such as
tennis tournaments.
   Dawson said she didn't know the cost of the program, but said it
was `millions of dollars.''
   Sullivan said the industry should stop advertising in newspapers
and magazines that have a large readership of young people and stop
targeting ads to young people, women and minorities. He also said
tobacco companies should not sponsor sporting events and stop all
free distribution of cigarettes.
   Fran Du Melle of the American Lung Association, who represented
a coalition that includes the American Heart Association and the
American Cancer Society, called the program ``just another public
relations effort to head off congressional consideration of
meaningful and effective legislation to regulate what has proven
itself to be an irresponsible industry.''
   She said the industry action would not curtail marketing tactics
targeted at children.
   ``Once again, the tobacco industry seeks to mislead the public
about its intentions by putting forward a package of reforms which
don't go far enough to have a meaningful impact,'' Du Melle said.
``These proposals can't withstand the most minimal scrutiny.''
   Another anti-smoking group, Action on Smoking Or Health, said
there already are local government efforts under way to curtain
sales of cigarettes to minors and that the tobacco industry
campaign ``is simply making a virtue of necessity.''
   ``I don't think anything the tobacco industry does will ever
satisfy our critics,'' Dawson said when asked if the industry was
trying to avoid federal legislation.
   The campaign was kicked off at a news conference that included
educators who said they endorsed the effort. The educators also
said they were being paid for their appearance.
   Dawson said the new industry advertising guidelines would forbid
cigarette advertising on billboards less than 500 feet from schools
or playgrounds. Clothing with cigarette brand names would be made
only in large sizes and mailed tobacco promotions would require a
statement that the recipient is 21 or older, she said.
   Asked about paid product placements in popular movies, Dawson
said the practice would be stopped. Cigarette companies have paid
movie producers to feature their brand name prominently among the
props used in films.
   Dawson said the tobacco lobby would actively support legislation
in states that permit cigarette sales to those under age 18.
   The District of Columbia and 11 states - Delaware, Georgia,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, New Mexico, North Carolina,
Vermont, Virginia and Wyoming - that either have no laws regarding
sales to minors or permit children as young as 16 to buy the
product.
   She said the effort also would include distributing signs and
buttons to retailers about tobacco sales to minors and a series of
advertisements in national magazines and newspapers explaining the
industry program.

   Trans World Airlines announced Tuesday it would
offer special discounts to people who want to visit relatives in
the military who are about to be shipped overseas.
   TWA said that on trips beginning between Wednesday and Christmas
Day, it will waive the advance purchase requirements on its
discounted non-refundable domestic fares.
   To be eligible, passengers must provide the name, rank and
serial number of their military relative, as well as the name of
their base and the base telephone number.
   The seats on the available flights are limited, and restrictions
will apply, TWA said in a statement.
   Sample fares would include $504 from New York to San Francisco,
or from Los Angeles for Norfolk, Va., TWA said.
   The discounts are being offered at a time when most holiday
travelers have already made their plans, and they could help fill
seats that have thus far gone unclaimed.

   Hershey Food Corp. is delivering Hershey
chocolate bar to U.S. troops that doesn't become a soft, gooey mess
in the Saudi Arabian desert.
   ``We have signed a contract with the U.S. Army to provide a
heat-resistant chocolate bar to the soldiers in Saudi Arabia,''
Hershey spokeswoman Bonnie Glass said Tuesday.
   The company has already turned over to the Army 144,000 of the
Hershey's Desert Bar, and Ms. Glass said they're on their way to
their field test in Saudi Arabia.
   Ms. Glass said the initial contract with Hershey was for a test
run of a new product that tastes as good as the old Hershey but is
tough enough for desert warfare.
   The traditional Hershey Bar turns to mush when the prevailing
temperature hits 100 degrees, as it does in Saudi Arabia.
   ``There have been heat-resistant bars in the past, but one of
the specifications given out by the Army is that it tastes good,
like commercially available chocolate,'' she said. ``Another
specification is that it is made with real milk chocolate.''
   Ms. Glass declined to discuss the bar's contents or how it's
made.
   The development of candy for military use isn't unprecedented.
M&amp;M's, a product of Mars Inc., based in Hackettstown, N.J., were
first made for military personnel during World War II.
   That product's slogan: ``Melts in your mouth, not in your
hands.''

   The stock market eased back Tuesday, as losses
among high-tech issues helped erase Monday's modest gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 10.64 points to
2,586.14.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 9 to 5 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 585 up, 999 down and 458 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 145.33 million shares, up from
138.65 million on Monday.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 181.79 million shares.
   Heading the NYSE's most active list was Occidental Petroleum,
which was up 1~ at 22|. The death of chairman Armand Hammer on
Monday stirred speculation that Occidental could be a takeover
target or that some of its holdings could be sold off.
   IBP Inc., of which Occidental owns slightly more than 50
percent, was the second most active issue, trading up 2| at 19.
   Analyst Jack Solomon at Bear Stearns &amp; Co. said high-tech stocks
were down on a disappointing report about orders and shipments for
computer chips as well as discouraging overviews taken by some
computer industry analysts.
   ``This whole high-tech area has suddenly been punctured, and
that puts a damper on the market,'' Solomon said.
   Other analysts said the market seemed to be showing a technical
weakness, because it fell at the same time oil prices and interest
rates were dropping. In other recent sessions, that might well have
pushed stocks higher.
   Among high-tech NYSE issues, Conner Peripherals was down 1| at
25\ and IBM was down { at 112~.
   Texas Instruments was able to avoid the downturn, rising { to

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. voted
Tuesday to tighten rules that affect banks and savings institutions
devoting a large part of their business to collecting mortgage
payments.
   The board of the agency voted 4-0 to allow no more than 50
percent of an institution's capital to be made up of the collection
contracts, known as mortgage-servicing rights.
   The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates
nationally-chartered banks, already has an even stricter limit, 25
percent. But state-chartered banks and S&amp;Ls had no limit.
   The S&amp;L bailout law enacted in August 1989 required regulators
to come up with a rule on the mortgage-servicing rights. They had
been debating it since February.
   The issue was whether the value of the servicing contracts was
too risky to count as capital, which represents the owner's
investment in a financial institution and acts as a loss-absorbing
buffer, protecting government deposit insurance funds.
   Mortgage-servicing rights are bought and sold among financial
institutions. After purchasing the right, institutions can then
earn a steady stream of fees for collecting monthly payments. They
forward the payments to the actual owners of the mortgages, often a
secondary mortgage company such as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.
   However, there is a risk. If interest rates drop and homeowners
refinance their loans, the old mortgages, and the value of the
right to service them, disappear.

   The government advanced its ambitious
privatization program Tuesday by launching the sale of Portugal's
leading commercial bank, Banco Portugues do Atlantico.
   The government made $382 million from the sale of 33 percent of
the bank's capital, according to results from the Oporto bourse.
   BPA President Joao Oliveira said the sale met expectations,
given the shaky international market. Figures from the bourse
indicated the sale was 20 percent oversubscribed.
   Foreign interest was slight. International investors were likely
to wait for the later stages of the three-phase privatization, said
reports in the Lisbon financial press. The second stage is
scheduled for late 1991.
   Since the first complete privatization in June of the Unicer
beermaker, five state firms have been sold successfully. November's
sale of the Centralcer brewery was 35 percent undersubscribed.

   Media giant Times Mirror Inc. said Tuesday it
plans to boost advertising rates and reduce capital spending next
year as it adjusts to the most severe advertising slump in more
than a decade.
   The diversified media company, which publishes the Los Angeles
Times and seven East Coast newspapers, is also trying to cut costs
with hiring freezes or layoffs in some divisions, foregoing a
dividend increase for the first time since 1983 and swearing off
major acquisitions.
   Chairman and Chief Executive Robert F. Erburu said the ad slump
that has spread from the Northeast to the West Coast has
deteriorated further in the fourth quarter and is expected to last
into the new year.
   But he said the main reason for the ad slowdown has been a
cyclical decline in the economy. He said the steps Times Mirror has
taken to cut costs will enable it to rebound when the economy
improves.
   In addition to its newspaper holdings, Los Angeles-based Times
Mirror owns four network-affiliated television stations, publishes
magazines and books and has interests in cable television systems.
   Erburu told the annual PaineWebber media outlook conference that
the company's businesses that are not dependent on advertising such
as professional infrmation, book publishing and cable operations
are showing healthy growth.
   But he said the company's overall performance ``likely will
continue to be weakened'' by the impact of the ad slump on the
company's other businesses.
   He did not provide specific earnings estimates, and a
spokeswoman said the company traditionally does not make such
forecasts.
   Another California-based media company, McClatchy Newspapers
Inc., said its operating results this year should about match last
year and may improve next year.
   Erwin Potts, president and chief executive, said the company is
better off than some other media companies because its 19
newspapers are located in cities that have withstood the economic
slump such as Sacramento and Modesto, Calif.
   ``To one degree or another, we are all singing the blues. But
I'm not going to join that chorus,'' he said.
   On Monday, media spending forecaster Robert Coen of the ad
agency McCann-Erickson said U.S. ad spending would be up 4.9
percent this year, its slowest advance since 1975, and would rise
only 4.6 percent in 1991.
   The slowdown, Coen said, is having its most pronounced effect on
newspapers that are seeing big declines in classified advertising
and only slow growth in spending by local retail advertisers.
   David Laventhol, chief operating officer at Times Mirror and
publisher and chief executive at the Los Angeles Times, said the
Times plans to boost its ad rates by 7 percent to 9 percent in
January.
   Rates at the East Coast newspapers, which include Newsday, New
York Newsday and the Baltimore Sun, will rise by 6 percent to 8
percent next year, he said.
   Laventhol said New York Newsday has seen circulation rise since
the strike Oct. 25 at the Daily News in New York. The Daily News
has continued to publish but has had difficulty distributing the
paper.
   New York Newsday's circulation is up by about 110,000 daily to
335,000 and by 225,000 on Sunday to 380,000, Laventhol said.
   The combined Sunday circulation of New York Newsday and Newsday
on Long Island surpassed 1 million this past Sunday for the first
time, he said.
   Erburu said ad rates at Times Mirror magazines would be
increased 3 percent to 9 percent next year. Its titles include
Field &amp; Stream, Popular Science and Home Mechanix.
   Times Mirror is reducing its capital spending to under $350
million in 1990 and to under $300 million in 1991 compared with
$420 million in 1989, he said.
   He said he doesn't expect ``any significant expenditure in the
acquisition area'' next year.
   Erburu also noted that the company recently announced it was
holding its dividend at $1.08 a share for 1991, the first year
since 1983 that it has not raised the payout.
   James P. Smith, vice president of finance and treasurer at
Sacramento-based McClatchy, said he was comfortable with analysts'
estimates of 1990 earnings of 88 cents to 95 cents a share, down
from $1.19 a share in 1989.
   Potts said 1990 operating results should be about even with 1989
when extraordinary items such as the debt incurred in buying three
newspapers in South Carolina and investment in a new newsprint mill
company are excluded.
   He said McClatchy will ``do a little better'' in 1991, mainly
because the classified advertising revenues are showing strength in
its markets while other newspaper groups are showing sharp
declines.
   Smith said revenues should grow 7 percent to 8 percent while
operating expenses including an expected newsprint price hike and
labor costs will go up by 7 percent to 9 percent. But non-operating
expenses should be down 25 percent to 35 percent, he said.
   Potts said the company is not seeking any acquisitions although
it has been approached by would-be sellers. He described the
company's strategy on acquisitions as ``opportunistic,'' however.

   The Equitable, the nation's third-largest life
insurer, said Tuesday it will convert from a mutual company to one
owned by stockholders so that it can more easily bolster its
troubled finances.
   The Equitable, with more than $135 billion in assets, would
become the largest insurer to take such a step, the company said.
   By converting from a mutual company owned by its policyholders
to a stockholder company, the Equitable will be able to raise funds
by selling shares to investors.
   James Guenther, an insurance industry analyst at the Chicago
investment firm Duff &amp; Phelps, said that as a mutual company, the
Equitable's options for raising additional funds are limited to
selling forms of debt instruments such as bonds.
   ``You can't raise equity capital (through selling shares), which
regulators want to see,'' he said. ``Debt is debt. It's something
that has to be paid back.''
   The Equitable suffers from declining values in its real estate
investments, losses in its large portfolio of high-risk junk bonds
and problems with its mortgage loans, analysts said.
   Late last month, rumors swept the financial markets that the
Equitable had missed a payment on its bonds and was near
insolvency. The company denied the rumors.
   ``I don't think it's a solvency question,'' said Michael
Frinquelli, an insurance industry analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc.
``But clearly they would like to have more capital if for no other
reason than to enable them to grow faster.''
   He said the Equitable's ability to write additional insurance
policies is limited by the size of its capital.
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., a major credit-rating agency, predicted
the insurance company will take large write-offs for its troubled
investments, which ``may cause a significant loss for the year and
reduce the company's capital.''
   S&amp;P added that the Equitable's greater investment in junk bonds
than other life insurers and its large mortgage loan portfolio
``indicates a potential for additional future investment-related
losses, given the current outlook in the economy in general and
investment markets in particular.''
   S&amp;P said the Equitable is ``already more thinly capitalized than
its peers.'' The ratings agency lowered by one notch its ratings on
the Equitable's ability to pay policyholder claims.
   S&amp;P said Equitable's announcement that it will convert to a
stockholder company ``indicates that the company recognizes its
need to seek significant external capital.''
   The Equitable said the conversion to a stockholder company could
take up to 18 months. Most of its 3 million policyholders would
receive payments in the form of cash or stock in the Equitable, the
insurer said, adding it was too soon to say how large the payouts
would be.
   ``These shares will become marketable and in some cases will
represent important additional value to these shareholders,'' said
Richard H. Jenrette, the Equitable's chairman and chief executive
officer.
   The conversion is allowed under a 1988 New York state law that
is similar to other demutualization laws enacted in others states
in recent years.
   In an interview, Jenrette said the principal reason for
demutualizing is to give the company more flexibility in raising
capital. But he denied that the Equitable was in trouble.
   ``The company is not in any jeopardy. We are in strong financial
shape,'' he said.
   Another reason for demutualization, he said, is that it would
give the company more flexibility as the financial services
industry is deregulated. As a mutual company, the Equitable cannot
participate in transactions with shareholder-owned companies.
   Due to the length of the conversion process, he said the company
may seek long-term private investors who in the meantime would
purchase notes that could be converted into stock when the
conversion is completed.
   The Equitable already has been in contact with several potential
investors, Jenrette said, declining to identify them.
   Frinquelli, the Salomon analyst, speculated that Japanese or
European companies may be interested in taking a stake in the
Equitable to gain a foothold in the U.S. insurance market. Jenrette
said foreign investors were among those he has contacted.
   The demutualization must be approved by state regulators and
certain classes of policyholders.
   The Equitable started as a stock company in 1859. It was
converted to a mutual company in 1918 under a plan devised by J.P.
Morgan &amp; Co.
   Among its divisions is the stock brokerage Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette Inc., which was co-founded by Jenrette. The Equitable
bought the brokerage in 1985.
   The last insurance company of any size to demutualize was Union
Mutual of Portland, Maine, which converted to a stockholder company
in 1986 and now is called Unum Corp., Frinquelli said.
   Frinquelli added that if the Equitable conversion is successful,
it could be the start of a trend.

   A tearful Ivana Trump was divorced Tuesday from
her millionaire husband, Donald, whose ``cruel and inhuman
treatment'' was cited for the end of their 12-year marriage.
   But the dissolution of the marriage left unresolved exactly who
will get what from the troubled Trump empire and whether the
couple's marital agreement giving The Donald the lion's share will
hold.
   ``There are two parts to any marriage: One, `Are we married?'
And two, `Do I owe you any money?' Today's we've cleared the way
for the real issue: division of property,'' said Trump's lawyer,
Jay Goldberg.
   Mrs. Trump, assisted by attorney Michael Kennedy, left the
courthouse in tears after the divorce was approved by state Judge
Phyllis Gangel-Jacob.
   While Mrs. Trump said through her attorney she would have no
further comment on the matter, her ex-husband issued a statement of
good will.
   ``I wish Ivana the best. I have no doubt that she will do very
well in the years to come,'' said Trump.
   But whether Mrs. Trump will do it with a reported $25 million
pre-nuptial agreement or with much more remains to be seen. The
judge said all other money matters such as child support, equitable
distribution of property and the validity of any pre- and
post-marital agreement will be decided at an April 11 hearing,
unless they are otherwise resolved.
   The property includes their Connecticut estate, their
condominium at the Trump Tower here and their Mar-A-Lago estate in
Florida.
   In court papers filed earlier this year, Mrs. Trump asked for
half Trump's estimated $5 billion. Since then, analysts say Trump's
fortune has fallen below $1 billion.
   Last month, Trump and his creditors agreed to a restructing of
$675 million in debt held by the investors in Trump's Taj Mahal
casino in Atlantic City, N.J. Under the agreement, the casino will
briefly come under protection of federal bankruptcy court.
   He also faces an $18.4 million bond payment due Saturday on
another casino, the Trump Castle. It is not known if he will be
able to make the payment.
   Mrs. Trump argued in court papers that the couple's updated
marital agreement, signed in December 1987, was drawn up while her
husband was already committing adultery and intended to leave her.
   In granting the divorce, Gangel-Jacob said Trump's ``cruel and
inhuman treatment'' made it improper for the couple to remain
married. The judge did not elaborate.
   Trump has been romantically linked with aspiring actress and
model Marla Maples.
   ``Marla is out of town on business. She won't be having any
comment,'' said her spokesman, Chuck Jones.
   The Trumps have three children, who have been staying with Mrs.
Trump since the couple's split became public in February.

<HEAD>Judge Approves Settlement in Mesa Takeover Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge approved a $6.7 million settlement
between T. Boone Pickens' Mesa Limited Partnership, Phillips
Petroleum Co. and Phillips shareholders.
   Mesa, Phillips and other defendants agreed to pay the amount to
settle the suit brought by shareholders unhappy with how Phillips
headed off Pickens' 1984 takeover bid.
   U.S. District Judge Murray M. Schwartz approved the settlement
in Wilmington, Del., on Monday and dismissed the case with
prejudice, which means it cannot be brought up again.
   Mesa will pay about 80 percent of the amount. The settlement
stipulates that the defendants make the payment without conceding
guilt or wrongdoing.
   In December 1984, Mesa offered $60 a share in cash for up to 23
million of Phillips' 154.6 million outstanding common shares. Mesa
was considering further shareholder enticements when it dropped the
bid in an agreement with Phillips, which is based in Bartlesville,
Okla.
   Under the agreement, Mesa said it would sell back its 8.9
million shares of Phillips stock to the company for $53 a share in
cash, giving Mesa a pre-tax profit of $89 million.
   Such a circumstance is sometimes considered ``greenmail,'' in
which a party threatens a takeover, but profits by forcing the
company to buy back its stock at a premium.
   Holders of Phillips shares between Dec. 5 and Dec. 21, 1984,
formed the class of plaintiffs in the suit.

<HEAD>Sotheby's Holdings Inc. Announces Restructuring, Staff Cuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sotheby's Holdings Inc., the world's largest
auction house, announced plans Tuesday to restructure its European
and Asian operations and trim its staff by 6 percent.
   Sotheby's also said it would focus more on higher quality, more
expensive artworks.
   The restructuring stemmed from a strategic review of European
and Asian operations last year, said Diana Phillips, a spokeswoman
for the auction house in London.
   It is also symptomatic of a slumping art market in certain
areas, especially Impressionist and contemporary art, said Tim
Llewellyn, managing director of Sotheby's International.
   The staff reduction will lead to 80 to 100 layoffs by the end of
next year, Phillips said. The auction house will attempt to find
employment for them, she said.
   Phillips said Sotheby's will be closing regional sales rooms in
Chester and Sussex, England, and in Florence, Italy. They will be
replaced by a major new auction center near London.
   ``It's a move by Sotheby's that will produce the best
possibility for growth and development in this decade,'' Phillips
said.

<HEAD>MNC Might Sell Credit-Card Subsidiary To Public</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   MNC Financial Inc., the parent of Maryland
National Bank, said it might spin off its giant credit-card
subsidiary, MBNA America, as a publicly traded company if it cannot
find a buyer for it.
   Such an offering could bring MNC as much as $1.13 billion,
according to the estimated price of $25 a share that was part of
the company's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
Tuesday. However, the stock price could change before the actual
offering.
   The filing was intended ``to expand MNC's options with respect
to the disposition of MBNA America,'' the company said in a
statement. ``The offering will not proceed if MNC Financial reaches
an agreement for the sale of MBNA America.''
   In the SEC filing, MNC proposed an initial public offering of 45
million shares in MBNA Corp., a company created to take over the
operations of MBNA America.
   MNC announced Oct. 25 it wanted to sell its profitable
credit-card division as a way of improving its sagging capital
condition. MBNA America, with $6.2 billion in credit-card
receivables, is considered one of the top credit-card operations in
the country.
   MNC made the announcement as it reported a third-quarter loss of
$173 million, or $2.05 a share, as the result of the bank holding
company putting $350 million into its reserves for possible loan
losses.
   The credit-card subsidiary, based in Newark, Del., has carved
out a high-income clientele by primarily offering cards to
professional, fraternal, educational and special interest
associations.
   MNC Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Alfred Lerner said in
October that the company hoped to sell MBNA by the end of the year.
   However, other banks that might be interested in buying it also
are strapped for cash and some are selling their credit-card
operations to raise capital.

<HEAD>Quasar Ordered To Pay $2.5 Million in Discrimination Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge ordered Quasar Co. to pay nearly
$2.5 million to three former employees who charged discrimination
on the basis of age and nationality, officials said Tuesday.
   The Japanese-owned consumer electronics company also must pay
court costs and attorney fees, making the total judgment greater
than $3 million, said attorney Norman Berger, who represents the
plaintiffs. The exact total of those fees was not available late
Tuesday.
   Quasar was found guilty of violating the Civil Rights Act of
1964 and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, according to
Berger.
   ``This is the first case we're aware of that, after a trial, a
Japanese company has been found guilty of this type of
discrimination,'' Berger said.
   The plaintiffs, John Fortino, Carl Meyers and F. William Schulz,
were fired from their management positions during a 1986
restructuring in which Quasar's work force was cut in half, Berger
said.
   Quasar officials said they were disappointed in the case's
outcome.
   ``We are fully confident of the merits of our position and
believe the court has made substantial errors in both law and in
fact,'' said Quasar spokesman John Monaco, reading a statement.
``Of course, we intend to appeal the decision and firmly believe
that ultimately our position in this case will be upheld.''
   Before the company's reorganization, Quasar had 89 managerial
employees. After the restructuring, the management staff was cut to
23, Berger said. Of that total, 14 were Americans and nine were
Japanese, he said.
   ``The evidence showed that Quasar had full knowledge of the laws
which prohibit discrimination, and yet it tried to circumvent these
laws,'' Berger said. ``The court found that Quasar would not have
fired any of our clients but for their national origin.''
   In a 1988 ruling, a jury awarded $1.9 million to the plaintiffs
in settlement of the age discrimination lawsuit. All three were
over 50 at the time of their dismissal. The three were told that
their jobs were being eliminated, but their functions were
reassigned to younger people, Berger said.
   U.S. District Judge James Alesia upheld the jury's 1988 decision
in post-trial motions and assessed additional fines in the
nationality discrimination case Friday.
   Quasar, based in suburban Elk Grove Village, handles sales and
distribution of consumer electronics and employees about 50 people.
The company is a division of the Japanese-owned Matsushita Electric
Corp. of America.

<HEAD>Investor Backs Out of Biggest Philippine Project Since Aquino Took
Over</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major Taiwanese investor has
withdrawn from a $500 million petrochemical project that would have
been the largest single foreign investment in the Philippines since
President Corazon Aquino took office in 1986.
   The group said it pulled out of the project, which has been
mired in political controversy, because of political unrest in the
island nation.
   Butch Pajarillo, spokesman of the Department of Trade and
Industry, said Wednesday that the investor, USI Far East, has
written Trade Secretary Jose Concepcion notifying him of the firm's
pullout.
   Concepcion's office received word of the pullout in a letter
from Anthony Chong, chairman of the Taiwanese firm, on Monday.
   In Taipei, USI Far East spokesman Lin Yun-teng confirmed the
company has decided to withdraw.
   ``We regret that we have to pull out the investment because of
political reasons. The petrochemical project is good for the
industry and the Philippine people,'' Lin said.
   He said fighting between different political factions in the
Philippines led to the decision.
   Concepcion strongly supported the project, saying it was crucial
in building a petrochemical industry in a country struggling to
cope with energy shortages. But critics charged Concepcion and
others had been too generous in its financing arrangements.
   The project became a major political controversy, underscoring
differences on investment policy within the Aquino government.
   Supporters of the project said opposition would discourage
foreign investment in the Philippines, whose economy is hobbled by
a $28 billion foreign debt, hard currency shortages and mounting
inflation.
