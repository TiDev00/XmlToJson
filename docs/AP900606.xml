   When landscape artist Albert Bierstadt
painted a huge canvas of Switzerland's Lake Lucerne in 1858, it was
well documented in art literature. Within decades, the painting was
lost _ until now.
   The 6-by-10-foot painting was found two weeks ago in the rural
Exeter home of the late Pearl Rose, whose family had owned, but
concealed, the canvas for 100 years.
   During the weekend, experts used writings about the painting to
confirm that the scene of the lake, with the Swiss Alps in the
background, was Bierstadt's work, said Linda Ferber, curator of
American painting at the Brooklyn Museum in New York.
   ``It's a piece of the Bierstadt puzzle and it's very nice to have
it back in the public domain,'' she said.
   Lewis Peck, who inherited the Bierstadt, said Wednesday the
family kept the painting a secret because they owned other artwork
and did not want that generally known.
   ``If you had a bar of gold in your house, would you tell
everybody about it?'' he asked in a telephone interview from Exeter,
in south central Rhode Island. ``That's about the way we did
things.''
   The whereabouts of the painting was last known in 1882 when Alvin
Adams, of Watertown, Mass., sold it in Boston.
   In 1890, it was purchased by Mrs. Rose's first husband, William
Sunderland, said Peck's wife, Sylvia. Peck, a distant cousin of Mrs.
Rose, inherited it in August when she died at age 86.
   The landscape is so large that when the family moved it to their
Exeter home 70 years ago, the roof had to be lifted to get the
painting in, Mrs. Peck said Tuesday. When it was removed two weeks
ago, ``we took the side of the house off,'' she said.
   The Pecks will sell the painting at auction on Oct. 6.
   The painting is typical of Bierstadt's earlier work, according to
Ferber, who is assembling an exhibit of Bierstadt's work for early
1991.
   Ferber did not know what the Lake Lucerne painting was worth. But
attorney Christopher Healey said Bierstadt's ``Moteratsch Glacier,
Upper Engadine Valley, Pontresina,'' about the same size as the
Pecks' painting, brought $990,000 at Sotheby's auction house May 24.
   Bierstadt, part of the Hudson River group of painters, built his
reputation on his panoramic landscapes of the American West.
   The World Book Encyclopedia calls Bierstadt ``one of the greatest
American romantic landscape painters,'' and said he received $25,000
for a painting in the latter half of the 1800s, a record for a
painting at that time.
   Bierstadt was born in Germany and raised in New Bedford, Mass. He
studied in Dusseldorf, Germany, from 1853 to 1857, and painted his
Lake Lucerne picture in New York, according to Ferber.
   She said there are other Bierstadt's that are unaccounted for,
although ``this was certainly one of the larger ones.'' Bierstadt
died in 1902 in New York City.

<HEAD>Hungary to Seek Dissolution of Military Part of Warsaw Pact</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Jozsef Antall said
Wednesday he plans to tell Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
that the Warsaw Pact is out of step with the political times and as
a military alliance should be dissolved by next year.
   ``We intend to make it clear that the Warsaw Pact as a political
organization, reflecting confrontation in Europe, is outdated,''
said Antall, only hours before departure for a key Pact summit in
Moscow.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said Tuesday that the
pact would undertake a ``transformation'' at the Moscow meeting and
urged NATO to do the same.
   ``It has lost its function in Europe,'' Antall said of the pact.
``Therefore, its military aspect can be discarded and, in our view
... dissolved by the end of 1991.''
   Expanding on his proposal to transform the seven-nation
Soviet-led alliance into a non-military pact, Antall told reporters,
``It is to be attained through ... the Helsinki process and the
Vienna disarmament talks.''
   The 35-nation Helsinki talks bring together all European nations
except Albania, as well as the United States and Canada, to discuss
various aspects of security and cooperation in Europe. The 16-member
North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact are meeting
in Vienna to discuss cutting conventional arms in Europe.
   Antall, Hungary's first non-Communist prime minister in more than
four decades, served notice shortly after assuming office last month
that he sought to pull his country out of the pact. He reiterated
Wednesday, however, that Hungary would only leave with the agreement
of all its pact partners.
   ``The intentions of the Hungarian people were made clear in
1956,'' he said alluding to the nation's failed attempt to leave the
pact during the anti-Stalinist revolution that was crushed by Soviet
tanks.
   ``But that does not mean we can disregard ... international law,
politics and military aspects,'' he said, arguing against a renewed
attempt on Hungary's part to leave unilaterally.
   Antall also said he saw no reason for NATO's disbanding.
   ``Unlike the Warsaw Pact, NATO is not in crisis,'' he said.
``Therefore, the dissolution of the NATO military alliance is not
linked to the question of the future of the Warsaw Pact.''
   Antall indicated Hungary would seek more independence within the
military alliance as long as it remained a member.
   ``We want to compile as soon as possible a list of all the things
we feel impinge upon the sovereignty of member states,'' he said.
``Such stipulations and confrontational elements must be struck from
the treaty.''

   The leader of Bulgaria's main opposition
alliance Tuesday predicted his group will take at least half the
vote in the June 10 elections.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. Embassy said Ambassador Sol Polansky met in
Copenhagen with James A. Baker III in response to a request by the
U.S. secretary of state ``to receive an assessment of the prospects
for free and fair elections in Bulgaria and in view of the
increasing concern about the fairness of the electoral process.''
   Baker and other foreign ministers of the 35-nation Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe are in Denmark to attend a CSCE
meeting.
   UDF chairman Zhelyu Zhelev made his electoral forecast in an
interview, after his alliance appeared to have suffered a setback
because of controversial comments made by another opposition leader.
   In the interview published in Bulgaria and abroad, Milan
Drenchev, head of the Agrarian Party Nikola Petkov, was quoted as
saying other UDF leaders understand nothing about politics.
   He reportedly announced his group would leave the opposition
alliance after the June 17 runoff and would run independently in
fall municipal elections.
   Officials of his party issued a denial Tuesday, and Zhelev said
Drenchev was misquoted.
   ``We believe we will win at least 50 percent, we are aiming for
more than that,'' Zhelev insisted, despite widespread belief the
ruling Communists, who now call themselves the Socialist Party,
would give the UDF a close race.
   He said attendance at recent opposition rallies was two to four
times larger than that of comparable events organized by the ruling
party.
   While expressing confidence the voting process would be fair
overall, Zhelev said he expects some attempts at manipulation.
   The ruling party ``came to power with an election fraud, with
totally rigged elections in 1946,'' he declared. ``It cannot
reconcile itself with the thought of losing power.''
   Western governments also have expressed interest recently in
keeping the balloting fair.
   Apart from foreign observers of the voting, including some from
the United States, other precautions have been taken, the opposition
leader said.
   At least two UDF representatives will be near each ballot box and
``Free and Fair Election'' student activists will be posted in 1,500
polling stations, about 10 percent of the total.

<HEAD>Cunhal Keeps Portugese Communists on Orthodox Course</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The winds of change have forced reform on
Communists throughout Europe, but veteran leader Alvaro Cunhal is
keeping his Portugese party firmly to the traditional course.
   ``Our party continues to declare itself a Marxist-Leninist
party,'' he told 2,000 delegates to the group's congress last month
in Loures, a Communist bastion 12 miles from Lisbon.
   ``Few of our comrades have expressed the opinion that the PCP
should follow the path that other Communist parties have trod,''
Cunhal said.
   Delegates raised clenched fists in salute and cheered their
leader, who is 76 and has led the party since 1961. They re-elected
him unanimously despite hints earlier this year that he might retire.
   Cunhal's decision to stay on may worry the growing reform
movement, but the congress also chose Carlos Carvalhas, a
48-year-old economist and member of the European Parliament, for the
new post of assistant general secretary.
   The combination of Cunhal and Carvalhas, who is more pragmatic
but not a member of the reformist wing, may be an attempt to mend
the rift between dissidents and the old guard.
   Reformers want the party to adapt its political program to
reflect the new situation in Eastern Europe, where the Soviet bloc
has collapsed, and Portugal's position as a stable democracy within
the 12-nation European Community. They also demand greater democracy
and openness in party operations.
   Party leaders have dealt firmly with dissenters.
   Zita Seabra, a leading campaigner for women's rights, was
expelled from the ranks in January after arguing for Cunhal's
resignation, a change in the party name and abandonment of
traditional ideology.
   Jose Luis Judas, a trade union official and leading critic of
Cunhal, was barred from the Loures congress. Other critics have been
dismissed from the party Central Committee.
   At the congress, Cunhal accused reformers of ``forming factions
that act in a conspiratorial and organized way within the party, and
carrying out a media campaign that places their action in a wider
anti-communist campaign against the party.''
   ``This will not be permitted,'' he declared.
   Dissidents say only reform can halt a decline that has seen the
party's share of the national vote drop from 21 percent in 1979 to
14 percent in December, when local elections were held.
   Some change has resulted from the fall of Communist regimes in
Eastern Europe. Cunhal acknowledges his former comrades ``commited
serious errors and isolated themselves from their people.''
   He has paid lip service to the reforms of Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
the Soviet president, but also said anti-communist forces backed by
the West could ``compromise the building of socialism.''
   Cunhal's party supported the Soviet-led invasion of
Czechoslovakia in 1968 and the Kremlin's intervention in
Afghanistan, which lasted nearly a decade. It was silent on the
brutal repression of China's pro-democracy movement a year ago and
sent delegates to the Romanian Communist Party congress before
Nicolae Ceausescu's downfall in December.
   Despite media reports of poor health, Cunhal demonstrated in two
lengthy speeches to the congress that he had lost none of his fiery
speaking style. Delegates in the Loures' Hall of Peace and
Friendship interrupted frequently with applause and chants of ``PCP!
PCP!''
   Cunhal spent 12 years in prison under the right-wing dictatorship
that governed Portugal for nearly half a century before a coup in
1974 opened the way for democracy.
   His 40 years of resistance to the dictatorship, years in jail and
torture by the secret police earned Cunhal legendary status among
followers and the respect of political opponents.
   Judas said recently that Cunhal would continue running the party
even after retirement.
   ``Its a bit like Deng Xiaoping,'' the senior Chinese leader,
Judas said. ``Even when he leaves the leadership, it's he who
commands.''
   He said the party must change because, ``in the future, being a
Communist won't be the same thing as being a Communist in 1917. .. .
If the Communist parties don't change, adapt, then they'll
disappear.''

   Slovak nationalists who would
like to create a separate state from the smaller of Czechoslovakia's
two republics have campaigned aggressively and noisily for Friday's
elections, the first free vote since 1946.
   While their Slovak National Party is unlikely to finish higher
than third in its native region, their cause could become a major
headache for the coalition governments likely to emerge at both
federal and republican levels after the voting.
   The chief task of the newly elected federal parliament in its
two-year term is to draft a new constitution. Deputies will have to
address the thorny question of Slovakia's status.
   All the parties campaigning in Slovakia have adopted powerful
local symbols, slogans and heroes in election posters and ads.
   The Christian Democrats, front-runners in Slovakia although not
nationwide, say outright that they favor a shift from federation to
a confederation that would loosen ties between two peoples whose
languages are very similar, but whose customs and history differ.
   Only foreign affairs, defense and finance should be regulated at
a national level in future, said Ivan Carnogursky, head of the
Slovak Christian Democrat Movement.
   According to his brother Jan, the Christian Democrats' leading
candidate in Slovakia, Slovakia should ultimately enter a united
Europe as a separate state.
   Nobody is advocating a swift separation. Czech and Slovak
economies are too intertwined for that.
   But the new freedom of speech and the full blast of an election
campaign mean that ancient rivalry between the dominant Czechs and
the more rural Slovaks, who make up about one-third of
Czechoslovakia`s 15.5 million people, is getting its fullest airing
in more than 40 years.
   In Czechoslovakia, a federation was formed in 1968. Czechs
resented it because it gave half the federal funds to a third of the
people. The 21-year rule of Gustav Husak, Communist Party chief,
later president, and a Slovak, also brought an influx of Slovaks to
Prague.
   Slovaks were not necessarily happy with what the federal money
bought. Much of the industry devised by Communist planners in the
name of evening out economic inequities was unsuited to the rural
region and blights the air and the eye around big cities such as the
capital, Bratislava.
   Nationalist sentiment first broke out in spring when
Czechoslovakia decided to follow other newly liberated east European
nations and remove ``Socialist'' from the country`s name.
   Slovaks first insisted on a hyphen in the name to make a
distinction between the Czech and Slovak regions. Thousands
demonstrated angrily when the hyphen was not made obligatory in the
Czech republic.
   The dispute eventually was settled by adopting the formal name
``Czech and Slovak Federative Republic`` for the country.
   The clumsy solution pleased almost nobody, and President Vaclav
Havel, a Czech, acknowledged that the name dispute had dispelled the
euphoria engendered by last winter's revolution.
   About 500 Slovak nationalists angrily disrupted Havel's final
campaign appearance in Bratislava on Monday, quieting down only when
admonished by Alexander Dubcek, the Slovak hero of the 1968 ``Prague
Spring.'' He reminded them that totalitarianism had not been
overthrown to make way for anarchy, noting that democracy demanded
they give the president a hearing.
   Earlier, Havel was interrupted several times during an appearance
in southern Slovakia at Komarno.
   Latest opinion polls give the Slovak National Party just 7
percent of the vote in the republic. But in Bratislava _ a
centuries-old city with a tradition of more openness than Slovakia's
sparsely populated mountains and valleys _ their support could go as
high as 12 percent.

   The government has issued a package
of anti-smoking measures in an attempt to discourage a habit shared
by about a third of the country's 150 million citizens.
   The measures, which went into effect at the beginning of June,
include a ban on cigarette sales to those under 18, a ban on TV
advertising for cigarettes between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m., and a ban on
free samples.
   They also include a recommendation to airline companies that
smoking be outlawed on flights of less than two hours, and a rule
that the warning ``Smoking is prejudicial to your health'' take up
20 percent of the space on print ads and billboards for cigarettes.
   Current laws prohibiting smoking in elevators, buses, and other
public areas are routinely ignored in Brazil, where an estimated
54.6 million people smoke.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Gorbachevs Took Home a Lot, Including Horseshoes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev may have
returned to Moscow bearing trade and arms agreements, but he and his
wife Raisa were laden with other souvenirs as well _ including two
of President Bush's horseshoes.
   Among the many gifts the Bushes gave the Gorbachevs during the
superpower summit was an orange pitching horseshoe mounted on a
wooden plaque.
   It was the lucky shoe that Gorbachev had tossed for a first-time
ringer at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland's
Catoctin Mountains, as he and his wife relaxed there last Saturday
with the Bushes.
   Bush presented the horseshoe plaque to Gorbachev at dinner that
night.
   But the next day, a second horseshoe was discovered missing from
the pit.
   At first, it wasn't clear what had happened, but now the mystery
has been solved.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday that
Mrs. Gorbachev, who was with her husband when he pitched his ringer,
put the second horseshoe in her purse.
   ``They took both,'' he said.
   Fitzwater said Mrs. Gorbachev had been invited to keep the second
horseshoe _ which was the one that she had pitched _ by a Bush aide.
   The president later joked to members of his Cabinet that
Gorbachev's visit had cost him two of his favorite horsehoes.
   The horseshoe-on-a-plaque gift was spontaneous. A more formal
exchange of gifts is part of every state visit.
   Considering how often Bush meets with foreign leaders, coming up
with new gift ideas must strain the creativity of White House social
planners.
   The president gave Gorbachev a five-volume biography, ``Life of
George Washington'' by former Chief Justice John Marshall. In
exchange, the Soviet leader gave Bush an antique painting of Russian
birch trees.
   Mrs. Bush gave Raisa Gorbachev a gold-and-rhinestone-trimmed
handbag; in return, she received an enameled tea set.
   Last year, the Gorbachevs gave the Bushes a box of glass
Christmas ornaments and seven children's books.
   Despite warming U.S.-Soviet relations, American gifts to Soviet
leaders just aren't what they used to be.
   Gorbachev got history books and a horseshoe. Former Soviet leader
Leonid Brezhnev was given a Lincoln Continental by then-President
Nixon at one of their summits.
   Sometimes gifts to and from foreign leaders can prove
troublesome, such as the two prized jaguars President Andres
Rodriguez of Paraguay gave Vice President Dan Quayle earlier this
year. It turned out the cats were on the U.S. endangered species
list and no American zoo would take them.
   Quayle had to give them back. He asked Rodriguez to release them
in the jungle.
   And Bush now may wish that he hadn't given leather cowboy boots
bearing the flags of Texas and China to Chinese Premier Li Peng. He
made the presentation when he visited Beijing last year _ several
months before government troops and tanks trampled pro-democracy
demonstrators in Tiananmen Square.
   U.S. law permits federal officials _ from the president on down _
to keep gifts from foreign governments only with a value of $180 or
less.
   Gifts worth more than that must be turned over to the State
Department for safekeeping.
   Barbara Bush used to give a slide show when her husband was vice
president. When she would get to the slide of herself and the emir
of Bahrain, she would tell audiences: ``The agonized look on my face
is because he had just given me $85,000 worth of jewelry, which I
immediately gave to the State Department.''
   It must be a coincidence, but it's remarkable how many public
officials list gifts at just under that $180 threshold on their
financial disclosure forms.
   For instance, Vice President Dan Quayle and his wife Marilyn gave
these values on gifts from foreign governments in 1989: a picture
and frame from the princess of Thailand, $170; a wooden carved bear
from a high-ranking Japanese official, $175; a vase from the
government of South Korea, $175; an engraved plate from El Salvador,
$175.
   Likewise, White House chief of staff John Sununu was able to keep
the lacquered samovar, two bottles of Russian vodka and four ounces
of black caviar that Gorbachev gave him last year. He valued the
gifts at $173.
   Sig Rogich, assistant to the president for special activities,
got a like amount of caviar and vodka from Gorbachev, and an art
book on impressionism as well. His figured the combined value at
$178.
   Deputy national security adviser Robert M. Gates reported
receiving a cinnabar vase and wooden stand from the government of
China. He estimated their worth at $160.
   Fitzwater said there is a process under which foreign gifts worth
more than $180 can be bought back from the government at auction.
   But, he said, ``I'll be honest with you. I've pressed the State
Department for 25 years and have never been able to discover how in
the world you do that.''
   As for himself, Fitzwater told reporters recently, ``I've got a
lacquered box from Gorbachev. That's my favorite gift. I can't keep
it because of the value, but I can keep it on display in the White
House. So it's in my office.''
   ``You can look at it any time you like,'' he said.

   For millions of Americans it will be a dream
realized; for organizers, a logistical nightmare. For eight chosen
cities it will be a time of tumult; for Nelson Mandela, simply, a
welcome.
   Freed in February after 27 years in South African jails, Mandela
plans an exultant tour of the United States this month, starting
with a New York ticker-tape parade and ending with a rally at the
Oakland, Calif., Coliseum.
   Organizers envision gatherings of uncommon size and emotion,
including throngs at Yankee Stadium in New York, Tiger Stadium in
Detroit and the Los Angeles Coliseum.
   ``We're asking that the people come to him,'' said New York
coordinator Jim Bell, who is overwhelmed with requests for Mandela
appearances.
   Mandela, deputy president of the African National Congress, will
pick the fruits of political stardom, as well. He'll meet with
President Bush, speak to a joint session of Congress, address the
United Nations General Assembly.
   ``It is a very important political breakthrough,'' one that
simultaneously raises the ANC's stature and pressures South Africa
to renounce apartheid, its system of racial separation, said ANC
spokesman Victor Mashabela.
   For the ANC, he said, ``All of this is powerful and positive.''
   It also is lucrative. Fund-raising is one of Mandela's goals, and
the ANC, South Africa's largest anti-apartheid movement, hopes to
realize $8 million from the visit. It will charge admission _ $5 to
$25 _ to the stadium concert-rallies, charge up to $25,000 per plate
at fund-raisers with wealthy sympathizers, even place donation cans
to collect change in restaurants.
   ``The African National Congress has never had such a national,
massive campaign for raising funds in this country,'' said Suzanne
DuBose, chief fund-raiser for Mayor David Dinkins. ``There has been
a real outpouring of support, and all of it is due to Nelson
Mandela.''
   There also has been an outpouring of invitations. School, church,
labor, business and political groups have besieged organizers with
requests for Mandela appearances. Celebrities want to appear with
him; Marvin Davis, former owner of 20th Century Fox, is to fly him
to the United States on his private Boeing-727; a New York limousine
service offered its services for free.
   In Boston, the Copley Plaza Hotel is donating accommodations
worth $70,000. In Atlanta, a group of black colleges will give
Mandela an honorary degree. In New York, so many religious groups
expressed interest that planners have invited 5,000 clergy members
to a rally with Mandela at a Manhattan church.
   ``The interest is a profound interest. It's an incredible
interest. It's huge. It's from the grassroots right up to the ivory
towers,'' said Carl McCaskill, a tour spokesman. The reason, he
suggested, is that as nations other than South Africa move toward
democracy, ``This is probably the last great opportunity to get
involved in something like this.''
   Some participants see the visit in intensely personal as well as
historic terms. ``As a black person it gives me great hope to see
that this man is a hero to all people, not just black people and
South Africans,'' said Colette Phillips, Boston spokeswoman for the
tour.
   ``This is like for me the single most significant thing that I
could do in my entire life,'' she said. ``If I died on June 24, the
day after Mr. Mandela leaves, I would feel that my life would have
been worth something. I could say I have helped rid the world of the
scourge of apartheid.''
   Mandela, 71, a lawyer, grew to heroic stature as he languished in
prison on a life term for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the
government. He was freed Feb. 11 in a gesture of conciliation by the
South African government, which has legalized the ANC and held talks
with its leaders.
   Since his release, Mandela has traveled throughout Africa and
visited Europe, but this will be his first visit to the United
States. He arrives June 20 and departs June 30, with stops in New
York, Boston, Washington, Atlanta, Miami, Detroit, Los Angeles and
Oakland.
   Mandela underwent surgery last week to have a benign cyst removed
from his bladder, and tour organizers said they were concerned about
his health and were intent on providing him with rests between
appearances.
   Still, his schedule _ and that of his wife, Winnie, who will
travel with him _ is arduous. Plans remain tentative, but motorcades
and stadium rallies are possible in each city. Mandela will meet
with business leaders, whom he will urge to boycott South Africa
until apartheid ends. He will meet with civil rights leaders, urging
them to continue their anti-apartheid efforts.
   And, in the midst of it all, there will be a family affair: In
Boston, Mandela will visit two of his daughters, Zenani
Mandela-Dlamini, 31, and Makaziwe Mandela, 36, both college
students. At a recent news conference, Dlamini worried that her
parents would have scant time for the reunion.
   ``So if anyone is offended that they can't see them,'' she said,
``just think of me.''

   Broadway set a box-office record for the third
consecutive year, selling $283 million in tickets during the 1989-90
season.
   The figure was up 8 percent from the previous season when sales
totaled $262 million, the League of American Theaters and Producers
said Tuesday.
   Attendance climbed to 8.03 million during the season that ended
Sunday, from 7.97 million the previous season but lower than the
8.14 million tickets sold two years ago.
   There were more new plays, more new musicals and more revivals on
Broadway during the recently concluded season than in the previous
season. Thirty-five productions opened during the 1989-90 season
including 15 new plays, eight new musicals, six revivals of plays,
four revivals of musicals and two special attractions.
   But ticket prices also climbed, with the average paid admission
for all shows at $35.25, up 7 percent from the 1988-89 season when
the average was $32.90. The top price was $60 for ``Jerome Robbins'
Broadway,'' with most other big musicals charging $55.
   Receipts for Broadway touring shows jumped to $367 million, up
from $256 million the previous year, a hike of 43 percent.
Contributing to the increase were two productions of ``The Phantom
of the Opera,'' doing great business in Los Angeles and Toronto.
   The number of theatergoers for touring shows climbed from 9.7
million to 12.9 million.
   Among the hits of the season were such diverse shows as the
musical ``City of Angels,'' the revival of ``Cat on a Hot Tin
Roof,'' and ``Lettice &amp; Lovage,'' a British comedy starring Maggie
Smith. There was strong competition for best play in last Sunday's
Tony Awards between ``The Piano Lesson,'' ``Prelude to a Kiss'' and
``The Grapes of Wrath,'' the eventual winner.
   Among the other stars who appeared on Broadway during the 1989-90
season were Dustin Hoffman, Vanessa Redgrave, Kathleen Turner, the
late Rex Harrison, Glynis Johns, Stewart Granger, Sting, Sid Caesar,
Timothy Hutton, Tom Hulce and Robert Morse.

<HEAD>Washington's Newest Think Tank Promises to be Different</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungry for more studies analyzing the ``big
issues'' of our time, but tired of the predictable pap from
established research organizations?
   Clyde Prestowitz has just what you need _ a new think tank. But
in a town with a think tank on nearly every corner, a new kid on the
block has to find a niche.
   According to its creators, the Economic Strategy Institute will
be the first research organization geared to the post-Cold War era,
a time when America's standing will be based not on its nuclear
arsenal but on its ability to compete economically with countries
such as Japan.
   ``When you consider the question of international trade and
international economics, virtually all of the think tanks are saying
the same thing,'' Prestowitz told a news conference Tuesday.
   ``We see a vacuum out there in terms of useful analysis to help
guide policymakers in an era that will be dominated by geo-economics
rather than geo-politics,'' he said.
   ``We are going to be the think tank of the 90s, the think tank
for America,'' said Ronald A. Morse, the institute's executive vice
president.
   The institute hopes to use its $1.4 million in donations from
corporations, labor unions and foundations to promote productivity
and competitiveness _ two current buzzwords in a country plagued by
fears of declining ability to measure up in the global marketplace.
   Given Prestowitz's history, it is likely that the institute's
views will be controversial. A top-ranking trade negotiator during
the Reagan administration's first term, he later wrote a
best-selling book on his experiences titled ``Trading Places: How We
are Giving Our Future to Japan and How to Reclaim It.''
   Prestowitz charged in his book that wrongheaded policies caused
soaring trade deficits and suggested that instead of trying to
Americanize the Japanese system, U.S. policymakers should copy
Japan's approach of fostering homegrown industry.
   Critics have accused Prestowitz of promoting an America-first
approach to policymaking that could topple the world into a round of
trade wars and protectionist barriers, killing off the free-trade
principles that have guided U.S. policy since the end of World War
II.
   Prestowitz says labels such as protectionist and free trade are
too simplistic.
   ``Neither of those (labels) exist in the real world. The reality
is somewhere in between,'' he said. ``We are trying to challenge the
old shibboleths.''
   To address the country's lagging competitiveness, Prestowitz said
government needs to boost woefully low business investment and to
re-orient American corporations toward longer-term objectives.
   The committee hosting Tuesday's inaugural dinner for the
institute included House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.,
and Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas.
   Dole said he saw the new institute as a ``wake-up call to
American leaders who seem to think that our economic strength can
continue to erode without threatening our national security, our
prosperity and our very way of life.''
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, who has lost several battles
inside the administration pushing for more economic support for U.S.
industry, sent best wishes.
   Among the new institute's financial backers are Ford Motor Co.,
Chrysler Corp., TRW Inc. and Motorola Inc. Among union backers are
the AFL-CIO, the United Auto Workers and the United Steelworkers.
   Prestowitz, who has argued in the past about heavy Japanese
spending on Washington lobbying, said the institute had not received
any financial backing from Japan.
   But ``we wouldn't turn it down, if it showed up on our
doorstep,'' he said.

   An Alzheimer's patient traveled 2,000 miles to
commit suicide with the help of a doctor who built a device that
gave her a lethal dose of chemicals.
   The last thing Janet Adkins told Dr. Jack Kevorkian on Monday
was, ``You just make my case known.'' Then, he said, she pressed a
button on the contraption and released the lethal mixture.
   Some medical ethicists called the doctor's actions immoral and
perhaps illegal. A prosecutor said he would wait for autopsy results
before deciding whether to charge Kevorkian, and will seek an
injunction to prevent the doctor from using the device again.
   Kevorkian told The Associated Press in a telephone interview late
Tuesday that it was the first time he had used the device to assist
a suicide.
   The Portland, Ore., woman's husband defended his wife's right to
die.
   ``She loved life. She just lived life to the fullest,'' Ron
Adkins said Tuesday night in a news conference in Portland. ``She
was a powerful woman and she was an intelligent woman.
   ``I was the weak one. She was strong. She had made up her mind.''
   One of the couple's three sons, Neil, said, ``She was in a very
good state of mind, that's the amazing thing.
   ``It was not a desperate thing or a depressed situation. She was
the one that helped us all through it,'' Neil Adkins told KGW-TV in
Portland.
   Kevorkian said Mrs. Adkins traveled to Michigan during the
weekend to use his suicide device. He drove the 54-year-old woman in
his van to a park in northern Oakland County on Monday afternoon.
   According to Kevorkian, he and one of his relatives attached Mrs.
Adkins to a heart monitor, then put an intravenous tube in her arm.
   The tube first delivered a saline solution. Kevorkian said Mrs.
Adkins then pressed a button that injected thiopental, a
coma-inducing drug, followed moments later by potassium chloride,
which stops the heart within minutes.
   He said she was unconscious in 25 seconds, and died in five or
six minutes.
   ``It simulates exactly the judicial executions that we do now
with legal executions, except with this device the person does it
himself by pushing a button,'' Kevorkian told The Detroit News on
Monday.
   ``The last thing Janet Adkins said was, `You just make my case
known,''' said Kevorkian.
   The doctor is a retired pathologist and an outspoken advocate of
what he calls doctor-assisted suicide.
   ``Physicians should not be killers, even in cases where the
patient requests it and there is a compassionate reason behind the
act,'' said Susan Wolf of the Hastings Center for bio-medical
research in Briarcliff, N.Y. ``They take an oath to do no harm, and
taking a life is doing harm.''
   Kevorkian said in March that he expected to be prosecuted after
the first use of the drug-injecting device. He also said he would
not charge patients and that he might use it to take his own life
some day.
   Adkins and her husband spent several hours by themselves before
she and the doctor drove to the park, Kevorkian said late Tuesday.
``I wasn't there, but from what I understand, it was very emotional
and very prolonged. Obviously, this was the last time they would see
each other,'' he said.
   After Mrs. Adkins died, Kevorkian notified police. Oakland County
Prosecutor Richard Thompson said he won't decide if he will bring
charges against the doctor until he gets an autopsy report and state
police finish their investigation. The police have the device,
Thompson added.
   Kevorkian said Adkins came to Michigan with her husband and a
friend, both of whom stayed at a motel while she died and caught a
flight back to Oregon later Monday night. In Oregon, providing the
means to commit suicide is a felony, but Michigan has no law against
suicide assisted by a physician.
   Kevorkian said the Adkinses contacted him in October after
learning about his device, and he recommended treatment with an
experimental drug at a Seattle hospital. But it didn't work, Ron
Adkins said.
   His wife of 34 years left a suicide letter, which read, in part:
``I have Alzheimer's disease and do not want to let it progress any
farther. I don't choose to put my family or myself through the agony
of this terrible disease.''
   The device itself _ an aluminum frame with three suspended
bottles and a small electric motor _ is not illegal, said Gerald
Poisson, assistant Oakland County prosecutor.
   But in certain cases, the person who made it available to the
suicide victim could be charged with homicide, he said Tuesday.
   Jim Baughman of the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office in Detroit
said last year that helping someone die would not be a crime if the
patient injected the drugs.
   But two lawyers specializing in medical ethics, after hearing
details of the Kevorkian case, said his actions were improper.
   ``What this physician did was way over the line,'' said Wolf.
``It was unethical and may well have been illegal.''
   According to the American Medical Association, passive euthanasia
is ethical, said Reinhard Priester of the Center for Biomedical
Ethics at the University of Minnesota.
   Passive euthanasia might, for example, involve withholding food
from a comatose patient believed to have no chance of recovery, he
said.
   But Priester said Kevorkian, by arranging a suicide ostensibly
with the patient's consent, appeared to have participated in active
euthanasia _ which the AMA has deemed morally inappropriate.
   ``The clear intent of providing those two chemicals was to hasten
the patient's death,'' Priester said.
   The New York City-based Society for the Right to Die supports
people's right to refuse medical treatment, but in general doesn't
support assisted suicide, said director Rose Gasner.
   ``He's pushing the boundaries,'' she said. ``It's uncharted legal
territory.''

<HEAD>New Test Promising in Diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease, Researchers

   A lab test to diagnose Alzheimer's disease in the
living could be developed within two years using a new technique
that has been highly accurate on brain tissue from cadavers,
scientists say.
   Currently, there is no precise way of diagnosing the
memory-robbing disease in the living. Doctors make a diagnosis based
on the patient's symptoms. After death, an autopsy can help confirm
the diagnosis, but the technique now in use is inexact.
   The new test measures a protein that is believed to be associated
with Alzheimer's and has not been detected in the brains of normal
people and those with other neurological disorders, said
neurobiochemist Hossein A. Ghanbari, lead author of the study in
today's Journal of the American Medical Association.
   ``The importance of this finding is that the protein can be used
later on as a model to come up with a diagnostic test in spinal
fluid,'' said Ghanbari, senior research scientist at Abbott
Laboratories in suburban North Chicago.
   The test for living patients could come within two years but
would need to be 1,000 times more sensitive, Ghanbari said in a
telephone interview Tuesday.
   The protein, which researchers call the Alzheimer's
disease-related protein, was found in 48 of 56 Alzheimer's patients,
the scientists reported.
   No detectable levels of the protein were found in autopsied brain
tissue from 27 patients free of neurological disease and 28 patients
with neurological diseases other than Alzheimer's, the researchers
said.
   Since they submitted their report, they have tested about 240
more brain samples and ``still have about a 90 percent agreement
with the diagnosis,'' Ghanbari said.
   An estimated 4 million U.S. adults, mostly over age 65, have
Alzheimer's a degenerative brain and nerve disorder. Death usually
comes in five to 10 years after complications from bed sores,
feeding problems and pneumonia.
   Diagnosis depends mostly on looking for symptoms, which begin
with memory loss and difficulty speaking and progress to personality
changes and loss of ability to function. Doctors adopt the process
of elimination, ruling out one by one other causes of the dementia,
such as syphillis or poisoning.
   Even after autopsy, current methods are inexact for diagnosing
Alzheimer's.
   Confirming the diagnosis in patients who have died requires
dissecting the brain, examining stained samples under a microscope
and counting the characteristic nerve tangles and hardened deposits,
or plaques, of Alzheimer's.
   ``The neuropathologist has to decide which ones to count and
which ones not to count,'' said Creighton Phelps, vice president for
medical and scientific affairs with the Chicago-based Alzheimer's
Association. ``It's subjective.
   ``This new test would remove the subjective component _ either
it's there or it's not,'' Phelps said. As such, it would be ``the
only quantitative test that we have.''
   The test will need confirmation by other scientists, said Phelps,
a former program director at the National Institute on Aging's
Neuroscience and Neuropsychology of Aging Program.
   Using the test now on brain samples from living patients makes
little sense, since no cure and no effective treatment for
Alzheimer's exists, and brain biopsy involves some risk, Ghanbari
said.
   The protein identified in the study includes a sub-protein called
A68 described in 1986 as a possible marker for Alzheimer's by
researcher Peter Davies of Albert Einstein College of Medicine of
Yeshiva University in New York, Ghanbari said. Davies was a
co-author of the new study, funded partly by Abbott and supported by
the National Institute of Mental Health.
   The protein differs from a defective blood protein called
transferrin described last month in the British journal Lancet by
scientists who thought it might help lead to a diagnostic test for
the disease, Ghanbari said.

<HEAD>With Threat of Soviet Blockade Fading, West Berlin Wants to Scrap
Reserves</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For more than four decades, West Berliners
have been stockpiling huge quantities of provisions to keep the city
alive in case of another Soviet blockade.
   City officials now say that changing times have made the
warehouses _ filled with sugar, grain, bandages, toothpaste and
hundreds of other items _ unnecessary.
   ``This is a relic of the Cold War,'' said Gerhard Erbe, the city
official in charge of supervising a large portion of the emergency
reserves.
   The Germans began stockpiling on the orders of the victorious
Western Allies _ the United States, France and Britain _ after the
Berlin Airlift broke the traumatic Soviet blockade in May 1949.
   West Berlin's leftist leaders say the federal government in Bonn
should ask the allies for permission to scrap the whole program for
the city of 2 million people.
   City government economics chief Peter Mitzscherling has even
suggested giving the food and other supplies to Eastern European
nations, where democracy has replaced Cold War Stalinism.
   West Berlin officials decline to give a breakdown of how much is
stored, saying it's still kept top secret to keep the ``potential
enemy'' from learning details of the plans.
   ``The goal is, in the event of another blockade, to provide the
city with all necessary goods,'' Erbe said. ``It was also to have a
calming effect on the people.''
   Erbe said the goods, stored in 200 separate locations, are to
last as rations for a ``long period of time,'' but he declined to
specify how long.
   One of the storehouses is located in teeming Westhafen along the
Spandau shipping canal, where sacks of sugar, medicines and
thousands of cases of jarred of fruit are carefully stored.
   Horst Kleffel, who supervises part of the program for the federal
government, said the plan was to have enough food on hand for six
months. But he concedes that ``Some things we now have in smaller
quantities.''
   The Berliner Morgenpost newspaper has reported that 166,444 tons
of grain, 38,752 tons of canned vegetables and 493,668 tons of light
heating oil are stored. The goods are routinely sold off and
restocked to ensure that everything is usable.
   Over the years the stockpiled goods have provided great comfort
to Berliners, especially the elderly, who remember how their city
was torn apart by the collapse of Nazi Germany in 1945 and shut off
from the world by the Soviet blockade three years later.
   The Soviets tried to starve the Western part of the city into
submission, blocking passengers and traffic starting in June 1948.
For 10{ months, a massive Western airlift organized by the United
States kept the city alive.
   Even though the Four Power agreement of 1971 set aside many of
the disputes with the Soviets, the emergency reserves stayed in this
city 100 miles within then-Communist East Germany.
   The federal government in Bonn provides about $125 million a year
to maintain the reserves, which could be worth up to $1.6 billion.
   As officials look around to save money during the enormously
expensive unification process, the reserves have become a likely
target for savings. They have also been the subject of sarcasm.
   ``The West Berlin city government even wanted to start getting
rid of the huge supplies of toilet paper, since according to state
secretary (Juergen) Dittberner, people could just use a newspaper in
an emergency,'' the Frankfurter Rundschau quoted the city's No. 2
economics official as saying.
   ``But at the prompting of the federal government, the toilet
paper stayed,'' the newspaper said.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government must study the request to
halt the program before deciding whether to pass it on to the
Western Allies.
   Anthony W. Sariti, U.S. diplomatic spokesman in Berlin, said it
is not certain what answer the Allies will give, but ``given the
tenor of the times, I can't imagine we would give it unsympathetic
hearing.''
   Selling off the stockpiles could take three or more years.
   The list of stockpiled items includes soap, cleaning materials,
coffee, fish, meat as well as clothing for children. Erbe said one
thing is missing: dog food to feed Berliners' adored pooches.
   ``People would have to share their own rations with their dogs,''
he said with a laugh.

   A former defense consultant was convicted
of conspiring to funnel sensitive military procurement data to a
corporation bidding on a $100 million project.
   A U.S. District Court jury on Tuesday found Mark C. Saunders
guilty of conspiracy, conversion of government property and six
counts of wire fraud. He was the fourth person convicted by trial in
the Operation Ill Wind investigation into Pentagon fraud.
   The jury found that Saunders was a middleman in a scheme to pass
confidential government information from George G. Stone, a Navy
procurement director, to Thomas Muldoon, a defense consultant for
Norden Systems Inc.
   Witnesses said Muldoon then sold the information to Norden, one
of 10 companies competing for a contract to design sophisticated
radar and communications systems for the Marine Corps.
   Norden, which was one of the final four companies considered for
the contract, dropped out of the competition when the investigation
began.
   Thirty-four individuals and corporations have pleaded guilty as a
result of the Ill Wind investigation, which began nearly two years
ago.

   Police charged a black critic of school
desegregation with distributing ``wanted'' posters offering $10,000
for the slayings of seven blacks negotiating an integration plan.
   Ralph Leon Stephens, 47, was arrested Tuesday and jailed on
charges of soliciting murder. He also was charged with extortion.
   ``This is a very serious matter,'' State Attorney Ed Austin said.
``But it is just a crime. It is not a racially motivated crime.''
   ``It appears to be a struggle in the black community,'' Sheriff
Jim McMillan said.
   The posters declared the seven black leaders were ``wanted dead
or alive for self-serving crimes, murdering our kids future! Shoot
on sight. $10,000 price guarantee.''
   The seven are key players in negotiations with school officials
to devise a desegregation plan that complies with a federal court
order. Stephens is a member of a committee opposed to local
desegregation plans, the sheriff said.
   School security officials, the sheriff's office and the FBI began
investigating the posters after they appeared on May 26.
   Police began hourly patrols around the homes of those named on
the posters: School Board members Wendell Holmes and Samuel Nesbitt,
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People education
chairman Fred Matthews, Jacksonville Urban League President Ronnie
Ferguson, the Rev. Rudolph Missick, Assistant Superintendent Alvin
White and Willye Dennis, president of the local chapter of the NAACP.
   In December, a package bomb similiar to those that killed a
federal appeals court judge and a Savannah, Ga., lawyer was
intercepted at Mrs. Dennis' office before it exploded.
   ``There is no connection at all to the earlier bombing threat to
Mrs. Dennis and the NAACP,'' McMillan said.

<HEAD>U.N. Report Says Children Face Greater Risks From Pollution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JESSICA BALDWIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Children face far greater risks from global
pollution than do adults, a United Nations report says.
   ``Children are too often the victims of pollution _ their young
bodies make them far more vulnerable than adults to the poisons we
spew into the air, and toxins we sow on Earth,'' said the UNICEF
report.
   The report by the U.N. Children's Fund, titled ``Children and the
Environment,'' was compiled in association with the U.N. Environment
Program and was released on Tuesday, World Environment Day.
   It listed many of the ills facing children in developing and
developed countries alike.
   Forty thousand children under the age of five die daily, it said.
About 100 million children live on the streets, where they are
forced to scavenge, steal and often fall prey to drugs, prostitution
and gangs, it said.
   An increasing number of children are AIDS orphans, whose parents
have died from the dread disease, it said.
   The number of children living in poverty in the United States has
risen by more than 3 million over the last 10 years, the report said.
   Despite the discouraging news of poverty, sickness and death, the
report said improved international cooperation on the environment
offers hope, as does the thawing of the Cold War.
   ``The ending of the Cold War provides a unique opportunity for
the great powers to confront the real threats to planetary
survival,'' the report said.
   Sir Richard Attenborough, speaking at a London news conference
where the report was introduced, called on governments and banks in
developed countries to work together on the Third World's
``appalling debt.''
   ``We give less to the Third World than we receive. Ten years ago
$40 billion went from the developed world to developing countries;
now that figure is $60 billion but it's going in the opposite
direction. It is a shaming thought,'' said Attenborough, who
received an Academy Award for directing the 1982 film ``Gandhi.''
   The report emphasized ``our generation's responsibility to
protect the Earth we bequeath our children'' and suggested that
priority be given to improving infant mortality rates and education
in developing countries.
   ``Efforts to lower births, however well planned, cannot fully
succeed unless they are accompanied by basic programs to protect
child health and ensure child survival,'' the report said.

<HEAD>Regulators Easing Lending Restrictions on S&amp;Ls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Under pressure from builders and Congress,
federal regulators are moving to ease lending restrictions imposed
on savings and loans under last year's bailout law.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision is proposing to temporarily
quadruple to 60 percent the percentage of capital that a qualified
thrift institution may lend to one borrower, an agency official said
Tuesday.
   The office was under intense pressure from lawmakers who were
inundated with complaints from builders that the rule was forcing
them to curtail projects, putting their employees out of work.
   Last year's S&amp;L legislation had sharply reduced the lending
limit, aiming to sever the cozy relationship between highflying S&amp;Ls
and some developers. In the past, loan limits were so high that the
default of a single loan could bankrupt a thrift.
   However, builders complained that the shift was too abrupt and
left many reputable builders unable to arrange alternative financing
for sound projects.
   Last month, the National Association of Homebuilders cited the
regulation as one element in a credit crunch they predicted would
cut housing construction nationally by 100,000 units to 1.28 million
this year.
   Under a draft regulation submitted by the thrift agency to the
Treasury Department and the Office of Management and Budget, the
strongest S&amp;Ls would be allowed to lend up to 60 percent of their
capital to a single U.S. developer for residential construction.
   That is four times the 15 percent limit imposed by S&amp;L bailout
legislation enacted last August. The limit would drop to 30 percent
before returning to the 15 percent mark at the end of 1991, said the
thrift office official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Before passage of the S&amp;L bailout law, thrifts had been allowed
to lend 100 percent of their capital to one borrower.
   The new transition rule would not apply to commercial projects,
and only S&amp;Ls currently meeting strict capital standards effective
in 1995 would be eligible. The thrift office official said 1,185 of
the nation's 2,502 solvent S&amp;Ls meet the test.
   ``This will give us some breathing room,'' said economist David
Seiders of the homebuilders group. ``We think it will provide a lot
of help.''
   The association had been pushing for a somewhat longer transition
period and had wanted regulators to make a larger group of thrifts
eligible for the relaxation. But, Seiders said, ``This is a step in
the right direction.''
   The homebuilders had mounted a campaign in Congress, where
legislators in both chambers were preparing amendments to the S&amp;L
law. A transition rule proposed by Rep. Peter Hoagland, D-Neb., had
attracted more than 60 cosponsors.
   However, Seiders said the builders all along had been looking for
relief from regulators rather than having to wait months for
Congress to change the law.
   Details of the loan-to-one-borrower proposal were first reported
in Tuesday editions of American Banker, a trade newspaper. The
thrift office hopes to formally announce the policy by the end of
the month, the agency official said.
   Regulators, in testimony to a House Banking subcommittee in
February, indicated that last year's law left them with no
discretion to issue a transition rule. However, Treasury
Undersecretary Robert Glauber told the Senate Banking Committee in
May that thrift office lawyers were working to establish their
authority to interpret the law.
   Seiders praised Timothy Ryan, the new director of the thrift
office, for his willingness to review the matter after taking office
two months ago.
   ``We think it's a good sign in terms of (prospects for) working
with Ryan'' and the agency, the homebuilders official said.

   Lt. Gov. Allen Kolstad on Tuesday defeated
three fellow Republicans for the right to challenge Sen. Max Baucus
in a bid to repeat the GOP's 1988 feat of knocking off a Democratic
incumbent.
   Baucus, seeking his third term, had no trouble turning back a
challenge for the Democratic nomination from John Driscoll, a Public
Service Commission member, and evangelist Curly Thornton.
   With 694 of 967 precincts reporting, Kolstad had 27,250 votes, or
42 percent, to 23,352 votes, or 36 percent, for businessman and
scientist Bruce Vorhauer; 8,569 votes, or 13 percent for state Sen.
Bill Farrell; and 4,981 votes, or 8 percent, for former business
executive John Domenech.
   In the Democratic race, Baucus had 61,054 votes, or 83 percent,
to 9,538 votes for Driscoll, or 13 percent, and 3,192 votes for
Thornton, or 4 percent.

   The Senate race was the only major contest on the Montana ballot.
Republicans are hoping for a replay this fall of the 1988 general
election, when Conrad Burns, a relatively unknown county
commissioner from Billings, toppled veteran Democratic Sen. John
Melcher.
   National Republicans, including President Bush and former
President Ronald Reagan, searched for a well-known Republican to
challenge Baucus. They recruited Kolstad, 58, who became lieutenant
governor only 17 months ago.
   Kolstad emphasized his farming background, his 20 years in the
state Legislature and his lifelong ties to Montana. The emphasis
also was a slap at Vorhauer, who moved his legal residence to
Montana only last fall.
   Vorhauer, 48, is best known as the inventor of the Today
contraceptive sponge. His campaign stressed his engineering and
science background as qualifying him to bring high-tech businesses
to the state.
   Farrell, 41, a trucking company owner, touted his working-man
image. Domenech, 36, campaigned for a national health plan.
   Baucus ran a quiet primary campaign, with neither of his
challengers having much money or elaborate organizations. Baucus has
raised about $2 million, citing the Republican challenge he will
face this fall.

   ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway'' is on Broadway.
Jerome Robbins' Ballet is at the New York State Theater in Lincoln
Center.
   There, the New York City Ballet began ``A Festival of Jerome
Robbins' Ballets'' on Tuesday night. It will last through June 17.
Seven programs are danced twice and one only once.
   Two impressions burst out at Tuesday's opening. Wow, what a
choreographer. Golly, what a company.
   The evening began with Robbins' famous ``Fancy Free,'' his first
ballet, with music by Leonard Bernstein and scenery by Oliver Smith.
Three sailors, feeling the emotion of the title, are on shore leave
in New York on a hot summer night in 1944, the year Robbins
choreographed it.
   The sailors who danced, chased girls and then teased and flirted
with them were Damian Woetzel, Tom Gold and Robert LaFosse. They
weren't as exuberant as some we've seen dance this ballet but their
dancing was so crisp and their characterizations so good they looked
like they'd been drilled by Robbins.
   The original trio of sailors was Harold Lang, John Kriza and
Robbins. This performance was dedicated to the memory of Kriza.
   ``Ives, Songs,'' from 1988 was very different. Much of it is
nostalgic. Maria Calegari and Stephanie Saland were listed as stars
but all 39 who danced looked so good one would like to list them all.
   David Evitts, accompanied by James Winn, sang poems by Ives, his
wife, Longfellow, Whittier, Lord Byron and Keats that Ives set to
music.
   Three ``little girls'' and two ``little boys'' played as a man
with gray hair watched, adding to the poignance as the audience
watched both. ``Tom Sails Away'' was another poignant song, as a
sailor's family group assembles, in his memory. Then he steps away
from them.
   In ``Ives, Songs,'' Robbins did some very clever things, created
some calm and beautiful moments, made some interesting abstract
dances.
   The evening's final ballet was ``Fanfare,'' from 1945, created to
celebrate the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. The music is
Britten's ``The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra.'' Dancers,
representing the instruments, dance short variations while narrator
David Jaffe says which instrument is being heard _ and seen.
   Robbins, a choreographer who can make an audience laugh, created
funny parts for the bassoons, Tracy Bennett and Albert Evans, and
percussion, Jean-Pierre Frohlick, Peter Boal and LaFosse.
   A minute of silence was observed before ``Fanfare'' in support of
the National Endowment for the Arts.
   The audience hoped to see Robbins take a bow but he did not.

   Michael Jackson, hospitalized for
chest pains, has been under pressure to finish an album and was
distressed by the deaths of his grandmother, AIDS victim Ryan White
and Sammy Davis Jr., says a spokesman.
   Jackson, 31, had been ill several days when he suffered pains
Sunday at home and was brought to St. John's Hospital and Health
Center.
   Jackson's cardiologist said a ``temporary setback'' in his
condition Monday delayed tests to find the cause of his pain, and
the singer may have to remain in the hospital for another day or
two, spokesman Bob Jones said Tuesday.
   ``In the meantime, Mr. Jackson remains under observation. His
condition is stable and he is resting comfortably,'' Jones said at a
news conference.
   It wasn't believed that Jackson, described by Jones as ``a health
nut,'' had a heart attack.

on it _ yet.
   ``I'm obliged to do the show until 1992, so any political plans I

   Joe, the pathological liar played by actor David Leisure, won't
be back in American Isuzu Motors Inc. commercials when the carmaker
introduces its 1991 lineup of vehicles, said the Della Femina,
McNamee WCRS advertising agency.
   The agency created Joe Isuzu in commercials that began in 1986.
The ads poked fun at carmaker claims. Joe would lie outrageously in
touting Isuzu vehicles. The ads usually carried subtitles correcting
his claims.
   Leisure has found other work on television, however. He stars in
the NBC comedy ``Empty Nest.'' (Honest.)

   ``Gonzo'' journalist Hunter S. Thompson says
he's tired after his near-miss with a drug trial, though he believes
he would have crushed the prosecution ``like rotten eggs.''
   ``It was going to be fun,'' Thompson said this week after eating
a 3 p.m. breakfast at the Woody Creek Tavern. ``We were going to cut
them into small chunks and slivers.''
   Four felony drug and explosives charges and three misdemeanor
charges against Thompson were dropped last week.
   Thompson, 53, was charged after Gail Palmer-Slater, a former porn
film producer, accused him of grabbing her breast and throwing a
drink at her when she visited his home Feb. 21 to interview him for
a story she planned to write.
   Prosecutors decided they didn't have enough evidence to convict
him.
   ``Frankly, I'm suffering a letdown,'' Thompson said. ``I was just
getting in the mood to get on their level. We would have crushed
them like eggs, rotten eggs.''

   Dean Stockwell, who dropped out of the public
eye at age 15 after appearing on Broadway and in several movies,
found nobody wanted him when he was ready to drop back in _ until he
ran into David Lynch.
   And Lynch, co-producer of ABC's ``Twin Peaks,'' told TV Guide in
its June 9 issue that he had presumed Stockwell was dead.
   Now Stockwell's career is very much alive. He won a Golden Globe
award for his work on NBC's ``Quantum Leap.''
   Stockwell, 54, first acted professionally at 6 in a Broadway play
and was signed to a seven-year MGM contract. He made several films,
including ``The Boy with Green Hair.''
   But he hated the attention and at age 15 dropped out ``to become
anonymous, to disappear,'' Stockwell said. When he tried to make a
comeback, ``I couldn't get work for a long, long time,'' he said.
   Then Lynch ran into him in Mexico City while working on a movie.
   ``This person looked familiar, but (I told myself) it couldn't be
who I thought it was, and it made me feel a little nutty,'' Lynch
said. ``Then I realized it was Dean, and he was alive.''
   Lynch eventually cast Stockwell in the movie ``Dune'' and later
in ``Blue Velvet.''

   Ex-fighter Joey Barnum says he offered a story
from his boxing career for the upcoming ``Rocky V'' movie _ and
Sylvester Stallone stole it.
   Barnum filed a plagiarism lawsuit Tuesday in federal court
against Stallone; Stallone's mother, Jacqueline; Stallone's brother,
Frank; and other defendants, including MGM-UA Distribution Co.
   Barnum, now a bail bondsman, seeks $600,000 damages plus gross
receipts from ``Rocky V.''
   Barnum, once the No. 3 lightweight contender during the 1940s,
became a trainer and got in an argument with a boxer who broke
training rules. The boxer cut Barnum's lip and Barnum sold all his
managing contracts to get in the ring with him, said Joe Seide,
Barnum's manager.
   ``It was one of the biggest grudge fights of the late '40s. Joey
Barnum won and cut him up bad,'' Seide said.
   The story was the subject of a TV special in 1955, Seide said.
More recently, ``He submitted the story idea to Stallone. He was
good friends with Jacqueline and Frank,'' Seide said.
   Stallone spokesman Paul Bloch said that he was unaware of the
lawsuit and that the defendants had no comment.

<HEAD>Thatcher Says British Beef is Safe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher says the French
and West German bans on British beef are ``quite illegal'' and
insists there was no health danger.
   ``British beef is safe,'' the prime minister said in the House of
Commons Tuesday. ``Those who have banned it have done so more as a
measure of protection for their own farmers.''
   France and West Germany both banned the import of British beef
after the discovery that some cattle were infected with bovie
spongiform encephlopathy, or mad cow disease.
   The disease, identified in Britain in 1986, is blamed for killing
13,648 cows here.
   
   The British government warned Tuesday that it would be forced to
retaliate in kind against the bans if they are not lifted at today's
emergency meeting of the European Community agriculture ministers in
Brussels.
   Conservative Party lawmaker John Watts said it would be improper
for Britain to respond in kind, but he urged British consumers to
use their purchasing power to boycott French goods, including
``appalling French Golden Delicious apples.''
   Another Tory, Alan Amos, was cheered when he said he had eaten
British beef for lunch and medical evidence showed it was
``perfectly safe.''
   French beef producers told their government Tuesday that they
wanted the ban on imports extended to beef from Ireland, which has
had 19 cases of bovie spongiform encephlopathy.
   The cause of ``mad cow'' disease is unknown. Because the symptoms
are similar to scrapie, a sheep disease, it is assumed the disease
was transmitted through cattle feeds.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The administration's plan to create a new
National Drug Intelligence Center to coordinate information on drug
traffickers is being criticized on Capitol Hill as an improper use
of scarce money.
   Justice Department officials briefed congressional appropriations
panels and other executive agencies Tuesday on a detailed plan for
NDIC, which was proposed in President Bush's National Drug Control
Strategy earlier this year.
   Several lawmakers questioned the proposal to spend money for the
center when some law enforcement agencies don't have enough money to
hire needed agents, one congressional aide said later.
   ``There is a general concern that this was not one of the No. 1
priorities, that the top priority should be staffing up the law
enforcement agencies on the street,'' said the staffer, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   ``There's still a lot of questions, things that are unanswered,
such as how are we going to pay for it,'' another aide said.
   The plan outlined in a Justice Department study calls for no
money to be spent this fiscal year, ending Sept. 30. However, NDIC
would cost about $8.1 million next year and $45.9 million in fiscal
1992, when it would be fully operational with 150 employees.
   The first two years include many non-recurring costs for such
things as computer equipment, so the estimated annual cost after
that would drop to $26.7 million, the report said.
   The study said the money should come from the special forfeiture
fund in the Office of National Drug Control Policy, headed by
William J. Bennett. That money is seized from drug traffickers.
   The NDIC came in for criticism even before the Justice Department
presented its report.
   Last month, three members of the House Armed Services
investigations subcommittee said that instead of creating a new
center, the El Paso Intelligence Center in Texas should be improved.
   That facility, run by the Drug Enforcement Administration,
coordinates tactical information to be used immediately, such as the
location of a possibly drug-laden aircraft. It does not provide
long-range strategic information.
   ``There is a propensity to proliferate intelligence fusion
centers, as if the administration believed the more intelligence
centers we created, the better intelligence product we would gain,''
Reps. Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass.; Lane Evans, D-Ill.; and Jim
McCrery, R-La., said in a report. ``But quantity is not quality.''
   Privately, some Justice Department officials agreed but said
Bennett's office had pushed hard for the new intelligence center and
the proposal reflects a good compromise.
   Justice Department spokeswoman Harri J. Kramer said the need for
NDIC became apparent ``in the course of involving other
non-traditional agencies in the drug war, such as the Defense
Department.''
   ``An enhanced mechanism for coordinating interaction between the
intelligence community and the law enforcement community were also
needed,'' Kramer said. ``The NDIC will play an important role in
addressing these two gaps as well as to refine the process of
establishing intelligence collection priorities.''
   Bennett's office applauded the Justice Department proposal. ``It
is exactly what the president calls for'' in his drug control
strategy, spokeswoman Amy Brown said.
   NDIC will involve the DEA, FBI, Immigration and Naturalization
Service, Customs Service, Coast Guard, CIA, National Security Agency
and the State, Defense and Treasury departments.

<HEAD>Soviets Finally Burying the West _ By Fax</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL PAGE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviets are making good on Nikita
Khrushchev's prediction that they'll bury the West. But they're
doing it with fax paper.
   ``If politically countries are changing, why should information
agencies work in the same manner, the old manner,'' said Alexander
Malyshkin, senior information officer for the Soviet Embassy.
   The Soviets, it seems, have discovered what everyone from
pro-democracy dissidents in China to American restaurants learned
before _ that the fax machine is a quick and stealthy way to get
your information where it hasn't gone before.
   It's glasnost for the information age, and the Soviets used it
with a vengeance during last week's superpower summit.
   ``I have been just inundated. ... Our fax machine has been going
almost constantly,'' Frank Partsch, editorial page editor of the
Omaha World-Herald, said Tuesday.
   Partsch said he was holding 30 to 40 pages of Soviet material,
about half what spewed out of his facsimile machine during the
summit.
   ``It's the first time I've ever seen this,'' said Bob Haring,
executive editor of the Tulsa World, who received 20 to 30 pages of
faxed material from the Soviet Embassy in Washington.
   The Soviets say it's nothing unusual, just another embassy using
technology _ a Japanese-made fax machine, that is _ to reach the
media.
   ``It's very effective,'' said embassy spokesman Boris Malakhov,
who said the embassy press office fax was in use ``constantly'' to
issue press advisories on President Mikhail Gorbachev's visit.
   But getting a fax from behind the Iron Curtain strikes some
recipients as unusual, and the Soviets say they're restructuring
their use of technology to get the word out about changes inside
their country.
   ``We're using modern know-how to reach newspapers,'' Malyshkin
said. ``American media is very fast, you know.''
   He said his office has one fax machine and aides work all the
time to relay articles by the official Novosti Press Agency, opinion
pieces by Soviet officials and even lighthearted features on life in
the Soviet republics.
   Malyshkin said he didn't know how many faxes his office sent out
last week.
   But if calls to a handful of newspapers are any indication, there
may be more openness than the American media can handle.
   ``I haven't had a chance to do anything with them,'' said
Virginia Hall, opinion pages editor of the Kansas City Star, where
about 10 Soviet faxes on various topics arrived.
   ``I haven't had a chance to read it,'' Partsch said from Omaha.
``There's a lot of it and I don't like faxes.''

   Thomas Root, the lawyer whose mysterious
Atlantic Ocean plane crash last year came amid a probe of his law
practice, faces up to 35 years in prison and $1.25 million in fines
on his guilty plea to felony charges of misrepresenting clients.
   Root, an Alexandria, Va., communications attorney, pleaded guilty
to five felony counts in federal court Tuesday. The charges involved
clients who were seeking broadcast licenses from the Federal
Communications Commission.
   He was indicted Monday by a grand jury in North Carolina on 455
counts of securities fraud and other charges.
   A federal grand jury in Washington had returned a 33-count
indictment against Root in March. Root, 37, declined comment after
entering his plea.
   Root's attorney, Eugene Propper, said Root ``feels he's getting a
lot more attention'' than he otherwise would because of the July 13,
1989, flight.
   Root's Cessna 210 airplane crashed in the Atlantic off the
Bahamas after a mysterious six-hour flight in which he said he
blacked out and the plane continued on autopilot until it hit the
water.
   But Navy fighter pilots who intercepted the flight said they saw
Root moving in the cockpit.
   Rescuers discovered Root had a gunshot wound to his stomach,
which still has not been explained. Root says he does not know how
he got shot.
   Root has denied that financial and legal troubles were connected
with the flight.
   Indicted with Root by the Nash Country, N.C., grand jury, were
Sonrise Management Services, Telemedia Inc. and three other men
identified as co-owners of the two businesses.
   Root handled radio license applications for investors of Sonrise
Management.
   The indictments allege the companies violated securities laws by
not registering securities, failing to register sales agents,
engaging in false and deceptive sales practices and conspiring to
violate securities laws.
   In the federal case, Root on Tuesday admitted giving the FCC a
counterfeit document stating that the Federal Aviation
Administration had approved a proposed Missouri site for a radio
tower.
   He also said he gave a North Carolina client a forged FCC
document indicating its license application had been reinstated, and
defrauded another North Carolina client by settling a claim against
a competitor for one-fifth the authorized amount.
   Root pleaded guilty to giving a false document to a New York
client seeking a site on Long Island for a radio station, and
falsely telling another client he would get an FCC application
reinstated when he had sought the dismissal.
   The former Missouri client, Monte Hanson, president of Northern
Missouri Christian Broadcasting Co. of Kirksville, said his company
had retained a new attorney and is still seeking an FCC license for
its proposed station.
   ``We're still working with the FCC and FAA to iron out the
problems that (Root) caused,'' Hanson said.
   The Columbus, Ga.-based Sonrise Management, which touted
Christian principles in sales literature and issued business cards
inscribed with crosses, went out of business several months ago.
   North Carolina Secretary of State Rufus Edmisten said only a
handful of Sonrise Management investors ever received FCC licenses.
   ``In all, 1,018 people in North Carolina contributed more than $8
million to this organization,'' Edmisten said. ``Nationally, more
than $16 million was invested by people from 25 states.''
   Edmisten said there was little chance investors would recoup
their money.

<HEAD>U.S.: No Marine Involvement In Liberian Civil War</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Lead prospects uncertain</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Marines are waiting off the coast of
Liberia in case they are needed to evacuate American citizens from
that nation's strife, but not to support either side in the civil
war, U.S. officials say.
   ``The U.S. military has no role to play in this conflict,'' State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher told reporters Tuesday.
   Despite pleas from embattled President Samuel Doe that the United
States ``come to the aid'' of the Liberian people, officials in
Washington reject the idea of U.S. military involvement.
   ``Our primary concern is protecting U.S. citizens,'' White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   In addition, though, the United States agreed to evacuate Soviet
diplomats from Liberia if necessary, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
said in an interview Tuesday with Hearst Newspapers.
   ``It hasn't been required yet, but the fact of the matter is they
(the Soviets) have asked for _ and we have agreed _ to provide
assistance to their people in Liberia,'' Cheney said in the
interview.
   Between 10 and 15 Soviet diplomats remained in Liberia, the
Hearst report said.
   Boucher, in a statement read to reporters, said the United States
``is taking appropriate steps to assist American citizens to leave
Liberia in the event that they are in more immediate danger and no
longer able to leave the country by other means.''
   The Navy's four-ship flotilla in international waters off the
Liberian coast ``solely on a contingency basis to evacuate American
citizens if it becomes necessary,'' Boucher said.
   Fitzwater reported that 70 U.S. officials and about 1,200
American private citizens were left in the country.
   President Bush dispatched the warships from the
Mediterranean-based 6th Fleet over the weekend in case the struggle
between forces loyal to Doe and those supporting rebel leader
Charles Taylor bar any Americans from leaving.
   The USS Saipan, an amphibious assault ship; the USS Ponce, an
amphibious transport dock ship; the USS Sumter, a tank landing ship,
and the USS Peterson, an escort destroyer, are off the Liberian
coast.
   As transport or evacuation aircraft, ships like the Saipan
usually carry nine CH-53 ``Sea Stallion'' helicopters and 12 CH-46
``Sea Knight'' helicopters.
   Such assault ships also carry AV-8B Harrier jets, which serve as
light attack and close air support aircraft.
   All of the ships are homeported in Norfolk, Va., and carry about
170 officers and about 2,100 enlisted Marines, the Navy said.
   Boucher said the rebels continued to advance towards the capital
of Monrovia and that flights had been suspended from Roberts
International Airport, where there were reports of fighting.
   The spokesman said commercial aircraft were continuing to use
Spriggs Payne Airfield, about five miles from the center of the
capital city, and that the road to Sierra Leone ``remains usable.''
   At the Pentagon, spokesman Pete Williams stressed the
precautionary nature of the deployment of the Marine group. He said
he couldn't define any ``trigger'' that might bring them ashore to
assist in an evacuation, including the event that all air travel
would be stopped.
   He said he had no indication that there were Americans who wanted
to leave but couldn't.
   Williams declined to outline any plan for a possible evacuation,
citing security concerns.
   But he said the Marines could be used for such things as
``providing security at the airport, or assisting Americans in
leaving from some other point _ out to the ships, or to another
country.''

   Television's most churlish family, ``The
Simpsons,'' outdrew the loving Huxtables of ``The Cosby Show'' and
finished fourth in the ratings last week, the first time Fox
Broadcasting has broken into the top 10.
   Two other Sunday night Fox shows, ``Married ... With Children''
and ``In Living Color,'' were 11th and 19th, respectively, the first
time the fledgling network has had three shows in the top 20.
   NBC's ``Cosby,'' which airs on Thursdays, tied for eighth in the
ratings, according to A.C. Nielsen Co. figures Tuesday. ``Cosby''
and ``The Simpsons'' will go head to head next season on Thursday
nights.
   Reruns of NBC's ``Cheers'' and ABC's ``Roseanne'' took the top
two spots.
   The premiere of comedian Jerry Seinfeld's half-hour series on NBC
was No. 3, while CBS' ``Dave Thomas Comedy Show'' tied for 59th
place. They were two of the few fresh shows broadcast last week as
the summer rerun season set in.
   NBC won the weekly ratings with an average of 10.9, followed by
ABC with 10.3 and CBS with 8.9. Each ratings point represents
921,000 households.
   A repeat of a tribute to Sammy Davis Jr., taped a few months
before his death on May 16, took 29th place for ABC. Most of the
program aired Sunday night against the Tony Awards ceremony on CBS,
which tied for 61st.
   Several ties indicated viewer drift as post-season blahs set in.
   Here are the Top 10 shows, their network and rating: ``Cheers,''
NBC, 18.1; ``Roseanne,'' ABC, 18.0; ``Seinfeld,'' NBC, 16.2;
``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' ABC, (tied with) ``The
Simpsons,'' Fox, 15.7; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 15.6; ``The Wonder
Years,'' ABC, 15.5; ``A Different World,'' NBC, (tied with) ``The
Cosby Show,'' NBC, (tied with) ``Unsolved Mysteries,'' NBC, 15.3.
   In the evening news, ABC was first for the 21st week in a row
with an average rating of 9.5. CBS and NBC tied at 7.5 each.

<HEAD>House Approves Apology, Compensation to Victims of Nuclear Testing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 40 years after exposing thousands of
Americans to dangerous radiation from nuclear testing programs, the
government is close to offering an apology and compensation to those
who have cancer.
   A bill approved by the House on voice vote Tuesday would set up a
$100 million fund to pay victims of radiation disease brought on by
the atmospheric nuclear testing program conducted in Nevada from
1945 to 1963 and the mining of uranium for the tests.
   The measure also carries a formal apology ``to the American
people that were subjected and sacrificed for the Cold War nuclear
weapons,'' said Rep. Wayne Owens, D-Utah, sponsor of the bill.
   The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act is awaiting floor action
in the Senate.
   Proponents of the bill described radioactive fallout that fell
like snow from the skies near the nuclear test site in Nevada.
   ``I remember as a child growing up in southern Utah watching the
sky light up with various colors from the nuclear explosions at the
Nevada test site just 100 crow-flying miles away,'' Owens said.
   He likened it to a Fourth of July fireworks display and said,
``The only difference was that instead of celebrating our
independence, years later, we were mourning the death of our friends
from the epidemic of leukemias and other cancers in southern Utah,''
he said.
   Owens said the government claimed at the time that no one's
health was endangered by the tests.
   The bill would affect people who lived in Nevada, Colorado, New
Mexico, Arizona, Utah and Wyoming.
   The legislation stems in part from work by Stewart Udall, former
congressman and interior secretary, who represented the uranium
miners in a lawsuit against the government in 1979.
   He started a drive for congressional action after the courts
ruled that the government was immune from prosecution because
national security needs dictated an uninterrupted flow of great
quantities of uranium ore.
   Owens was part of a team of lawyers who sued the government on
behalf of the so-called downwinders. Judges in that case ruled
similarly to the one involving the miners.
   Udall said that despite the rulings, some of the judges who
handled the case wrote opinions that counseled the plaintiffs to
seek redress from Congress.
   ``Today, the House of Representatives restores our nation's honor
by holding the government responsible for Cold War abuses that have
stained our collective consciences by causing death and injury to
its own people,'' Owens said. ``The Cold War can't be over until we
have paid the debt to the civilian victims.''
   During the atmospheric atomic weapons testing, an estimated
220,000 military personnel and 150,000 civilians were exposed to
radiation. Those in the military who became ill have received
disability benefits.
   Udall said about 950 to 1,300 miners or their families would
receive compensation.
   Under the bill, the Justice Department would establish the
amounts people would be paid based on medical documentation.
   To be eligible, individuals would have to have been in areas
downwind from the Nevada test site for at least a year between 1951
and 1958, or between June and July 1962. Miners who worked in
uranium mines between 1947 and 1971 would be eligible if they were
exposed to a specific amount of radiation.

<HEAD>Lugar Firmly Opposing Boosts in Target Prices, Loan Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Agriculture Committee is getting
strong opposition from its ranking Republican to any increases in
target prices or loan rates in the 1990 farm bill.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said Tuesday he was standing firm on
freezing target prices and loan rates. And he said he was unwilling
to take more acreage out of production or accept shifts in finances
to create the illusion of deficit reduction.
   ``I've been infinitely flexible in other things (in the bill),''
Lugar said. But he said these four areas were not negotiable and
would lead to a floor fight if the Democratic majority on the
committee insists in keeping them in the bill.
   ``The Democrats have to decide `do we want an issue, or do we
want a bill?''' said Lugar. ``If an issue is what they want, then my
guess is we will have a one-year extension'' in the 1985 farm bill
expiring this year.
   Lugar commented at a breakfast meeting with reporters immediately
before he went into a session with a bipartisan task force created
by Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., to work out
a compromise on commodities supports.
   The task force also includes Sens. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb.; David
Pryor, D-Ark.; Bob Dole, R-Kan.; and Thad Cochran, R-Miss. Not all
members were present and little was accomplished at Tuesday's
meeting, sources close to the committee said.
   The Democrats want to increase target prices 1 percent, with
other increases possible in the last four years of the program
depending on inflation.
   Congress passes a farm bill every five years to set agriculture
policy, including the degree to which government will subsidize
farmers through target prices and loan rates.
   Current law expires in December, but the Bush administration has
said repeatedly that it would accept a one-year extension of
existing policies.
   That is viewed by many in Congress as a strategy which would help
U.S. negotiators at the international trade talks known as the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The United States is trying
to get other countries to remove subsidies from agricultural
products that distort world market prices.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, who is actively involved
in those talks, has said that U.S. subsidies may have to be adjusted
to comply with whatever agreement develops. They are expected to be
completed by the end of this year.
   Lugar mentioned the trade talks in his talk with reporters, but
he said his main objection to the Democrats' proposal for increasing
target prices is budgetary.
   ``At a time when it is fairly likely people may be asked to pay
more taxes, for the farm program to be asking for more money is not
prudent,'' he said.
   The House Agriculture Committee, meanwhile, has voted to freeze
target prices.

   The guesswork will be taken out of agricultural
finance when guidelines developed through the American Bankers
Association are in effect, say members of task force that developed
the program.
   Standardized methods for figuring farm expenses will help make
farmers more competitive by giving them better information as to how
their operations stack up financially with all others, the task
force said Tuesday.
   ``The producers have been looking for help,'' said Steve Hofing,
a consultant from Champaign, Ill., who served on the panel.
   He said farm business has been hindered because each creditor and
farmer has his own set of forms and method of record-keeping.
   ``We need guidelines so net farm income means the same thing in
Maryland as in Washington state,'' said Hofing.
   This will be achieved by standardization of farm financial ratio
calculations, definitions and reporting formats.
   Jim McGrann of Texas A&amp;M University, a member of the task force,
said farmer are increasingly using computers and that software
companies are big supporters of the standardization.
   McGrann said that use of standard financial reporting will give
the government a more exact idea of the economic condition of
agriculture when it comes time to develop the five-year farm bill.
   Stanley Forbes, chairman of the task force, said the guidelines
could be fully adopted by farmers and financial institutions within
five years.

   Teacher lobbyist Paul Hubbert won a place
in the Democratic runoff for the nomination to oppose Gov. Guy Hunt,
but the primary Tuesday was too close to call the second spot.
   Hunt, a preacher-farmer thrust into the state's top office four
years ago when he became the first Republican elected to the post
this century, easily defeated two minor candidates to win the GOP
nomination.
   No Democratic candidate won a majority, making a runoff June 26
necessary.
   With 3,014 precincts of 4,196 reporting in the Democratic
primary, Hubbert had 164,993 votes, or 32 percent, to 125,518 votes,
or 24 percent, for Attorney General Don Siegelman; 114,852 votes, or
22 percent, for former Gov. Fob James; and 91,791 votes, or 18
percent, for U.S. Rep. Ronnie Flippo. State Sen. Charles Bishop
received 21,759 votes, or 4 percent, and prison employee Ed Daw had
2,514 votes, or less than 1 percent.
   None of the candidates trailing Hubbert conceded defeat Tuesday
evening.
   ``We're not through with this fight yet,'' said Flippo. ``This is
no place for the faint-hearted, and there's nobody faint-hearted
here.''
   In the Republican primary, Hunt had 92,799 votes, or 96 percent,
to 2,430 votes, or 3 percent, for retired businessman Jim Watley;
and 1,897 votes, or 2 percent, for state Highway Department employee
Jack Pollard, with 2,783 precincts of 4,196 reporting.
   Sen. Howell Heflin, a Democrat, overcame token opposition to win
renomination to a third term. With 2,794 precincts of 4,196
reporting, Heflin had 338,018 votes, or 81 percent, to 79,828 votes,
or 19 percent, for Mrs. Frank Ross Stewart.
   Heflin's Republican challenger, state Sen. Bill Cabaniss, was
unopposed for the GOP nomination.
   A constitutional amendment to make English the state's official
language was overwhelmingly approved. With 1,670 precincts of 4,196
reporting, there were 181,558 votes, or 90 percent, in favor of the
proposal to 20,953 votes, or 10 percent, against.
   The English-language amendment gives Alabama residents the right
to sue if it is violated, but does not define what constitutes a
violation.

   Hunt, 56, a Primitive Baptist minister who regularly preaches
near his north Alabama fruit farm, benefitted four years ago from a
bitter Democratic runoff. This time the leading Democrats mostly
avoided the kind of personal attacks that marked the 1986 campaign.
   James, 55, based his campaign in part on holdover support from
1978, when he was elected governor.
   He chose not to seek a second term in 1982, then lost a comeback
bid in 1986. He spent much of the 1990 campaign seeking to emphasize
his achievements during his administration, which was depicted by
critics as being fumble-prone.
   Hubbert, 54, and Siegelman, 44, appeared to be battling for some
of the same votes, including those of blacks and organized labor.
   Flippo, 52, gave up a safe congressional seat in north Alabama to
seek the governor's seat.

<HEAD>Safety Board Calls For Underwater Bridge Inspections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal safety investigators say thousands of
bridges need to be inspected by underwater divers to see if they
face the same danger that caused a Tennessee bridge to collapse last
year, killing eight motorists.
   The National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday blamed
erosion from a shifting river channel for the April 1, 1989,
collapse of a U.S. 51 bridge over the Hatchie River, 45 miles north
of Memphis.
   ``It certainly raises a serious concern with me about how much
damage may have been done with flooding in Texas and the South,''
said NTSB Chairman James Kolstad. ``I'm concerned that some of these
bridges may be put back into service without adequate inspection.''
   The board called for a modification of federal bridge inspections
standards to require underwater inspection of bridge parts exposed
to ``excessive water depth or turbidity.''
   It also asked the Tennessee Department of Transportation to
follow up bridge inspections with further work by divers when there
are doubts about submerged elements.
   The board cited the 54-year-old Hatchie bridge's simple design as
a contributing factor in the accident that caused vehicles to plunge
into the river from the highway's two northbound lanes.
   A newer southbound span remained intact, but board investigators
said its construction in 1974 accelerated movement of the river
channel, which had changed 83 feet from the time the northbound
bridge was constructed in 1936.
   The board cited the Tennessee Department of Transportation for
failing to evaluate and correct problems found in inspections dating
back to 1979.
   NTSB investigators said they did not know how many of the
nation's 500,000 bridges might require underwater inspection and
other steps to ensure their safety.
   But investigator Claude Harris said the number needing additional
scrutiny would number in the thousands.
   A survey last year by the National Association of Counties
estimated that 165,000 bridges need repair or replacement, with some
states having up to 90 percent defective bridges.
   The board voted 3-1 on the probable cause in the Tennessee
collapse and 4-0 on a set of recommendations to federal and state
officials. Board member Jim Burnett said he would not support the
conclusion until missing bridge parts are recovered and further
inspections are made.
   The NTSB's investigation remains open, said Kolstad, and could be
revised if evidence surfaces that points to further deficiencies in
the bridge. Investigators told the board that bridge parts might be
raised from the water in about two weeks.
   The board said the bridge failed ``most likely'' from the
deterioration of timber piles that were originally buried and not
designed to be in water.
   Board members also cautioned Tennessee authorities against
allowing so many exemptions to vehicle weight restrictions on
bridges _ about 70 a month for the Hatchie bridge before it
collapsed _ and called for closer scrutiny of overweight trucks and
their impact on bridge safety.

<HEAD>Pentagon Has $50 Billion in Unspent Money</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon has not spent $50 billion in money
appropriated to it, and congressional investigators fear it could be
used at will by the department for major programs such as the B-2
bomber and attack submarine.
   ``The existence of these accounts hampers the Congress' ability
to control obligations,'' staff investigators for a House
subcommittee said in a draft version of testimony to be delivered
today.
   The Agency for International Development also has more than $11
billion in unspent money and the Energy Department has about $325
million, the investigators said.
   But the Pentagon has the largest reserve of unspent cash in two
accounts _ one known as the ``M'' account, the other called a merged
surplus authority account.
   Money appropriated by Congress must be obligated or spent during
a specific time period. If not, the funds lapse and the money is
returned to the general fund of the U.S. Treasury.
   The ``M'' account includes unspent money that is maintained by an
agency or department and is used to pay previous obligations. The
merged surplus authority account is a Treasury Department account
maintained by the appropriate agency and used for similar purposes.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations, earlier this
year accused the Pentagon of maintaining ``semi-secret slush funds.''
   The Pentagon, in a statement released Tuesday, said the accounts
are ``neither a `secret' nor a `slush' fund.''
   ``Any significant use of such balances requires congressional
approval (each adjustment after first $25 million),'' said the
Pentagon, which noted that requirements for their use of the money
is more stringent than for other federal agencies.
   Congress created the accounts in 1956 to avoid appropriating
additional money every year to pay for prior obligations.
   ``They were intended to relieve Congress of having to get
involved in numerous nickel-and-dime transactions that the U.S.
government was validly obligated to pay,'' investigators for
Dingell's subcommittee said of the accounts.
   ``No one envisioned these accounts would grow into a $100 billion
fund ... which could be drawn upon whenever the agency concluded
these monies could be used to fund obligations within the scope of
existing contracts.''
   Investigators from the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on
oversight and investigations said they had evidence that the Navy's
Aviation Supply Office had ``selectively purged'' many of its
records in the ``M'' account.
   The result is that the Defense Contract Service Administration is
paying bills totaling $123 million that the Navy cannot determine is
valid, investigators said.
   In addition, the Air Force recently used $500 million from the
two accounts to correct problems with the B-1B bomber.
   The investigators suggested that the Pentagon could take a
similar approach in correcting problems with the DDG-51
guided-missile destroyer, the B-2 stealth bomber and the SSN-21
submarine.
   ``What is troubling is that this expired authority could be
converted into paying the bills to correct these deficiencies
without the approval of Congress,'' the investigators said.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., in a March letter to the House Budget
Committee, called for legislation to the appropriations bill to end
the accounts.
   ``With the existence of these slush funds, the Congress could
virtually kill a weapons program and find out years later that it
was still being funded from these accounts,'' the congressman said.

<TEXT>
   After more than two years of praying for rain
_ in homes, churches and on the steps of the state Capitol _ North
Dakotans can see puddles in their wheat fields.
   Now they're giving thanks, even though it's too early to say the
drought is over.
   ``It was so bleak and dry for so long that when we got the rain
last week everyone came in with sunshine on their faces,'' said
Gertrude Buscher, executive vice president of the Bank of Beulah.
   Some folks are calling it the ``million-dollar rain.''
   Sanford Williams, who farms 2,200 acres near Wing in central
North Dakota, said 4 inches of rain in the past few days are giving
his crops new life.
   ``Two years ago, we didn't pull the combine out at all. Last
year, we used the oats for hay,'' said Alvin Braun, who farms with
his father near Bismarck.
   Braun got .95 inch of rain over the weekend _ not as much as he
needs but enough to give him hope.
   ``The drought is hard financially on everybody, but I think the
mental stress is worse. Just knowing it can rain is really a help,''
he said.
   Most of the rain has fallen in the eastern part of the state.
Fargo has reported 5 inches since March 25, nearly half an inch
above normal. The area got more than 2 inches during a soaking last
weekend.
   Farther west, Minot has seen 4{ inches of rain, slightly below
average, and Dickinson has had 2.9 inches, a little more than an
inch below normal.
   ``I think most people in the state are cautiously optimistic,''
Lt. Gov. Lloyd Omdahl said Tuesday. ``There's no doubt it's done an
awful lot for morale, but they realize they need a lot more.''
   The prospect of a third year of drought prompted more than 100
people to gather on the steps of the Capitol last month to pray for
rain. A rain dance also was held.
   ``We feel Christians responded seriously and God has honored
that,'' said the Rev. Dom Vetter of Bismarck, organizer of the
prayer service.
   While the rain is the main topic of discussion in coffee shops
and on street corners, farm experts warn the drought is far from
over.
   The rain has moistened dry topsoil but it has done little to
restore soil reserves. A study this week found moisture under the
top 4 inches of soil still short over 97 percent of the state.
   ``We're starting to catch up in precipitation, but it's spotty,''
said Mark Ewens, a National Weather Service forecaster in Fargo.
   Last year, North Dakota crops looked good until July 1, when
temperatures in the 90s and three weeks of no rain burned up the
fields.
   That could happen again, warned James Helm, a North Dakota State
University agronomist. So far, temperatures have been cool, with
highs in the 70s.
   The cool, wet weather also has hurt one bumper crop _ an unwanted
one _ by slowing the hatching of grasshoppers that invade during dry
spells.

   Federally funded colleges and universities
would have to report graduation rates for student athletes and
others under a House-passed bill described as ``a consumer rights
bill.''
   The bill cleared the House on a voice vote Tuesday and was
returned to the Senate, which earlier approved a different version.
   Under the bill, federally supported institutions would have to
report to the Education Department their overall graduation rates,
student-athlete graduation rates, revenues from intercollegiate
athletics, campus security policies, campus crime statistics and
information about results of campus disciplinary hearings.
   The graduation rates would pertain only to fulltime,
degree-seeking students.
   ``It provides students with information which will assist them in
making decisions concerning college attendance and ... information
they need to protect themselves against becoming crime victims,''
Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., said.
   Much of the debate focused on provisions dealing with
intercollegiate athletics.
   Student athletes have a right to know whether a school will treat
them ``as chattel properties'' or as genuine students in need of
preparation for life beyond the playing field, said Rep. Paul Henry,
R-Mich.
   ``Sports are the top public relations vehicle for many colleges
and universities,'' Henry said. ``Thus, fielding winning teams
becomes to a very large extent the consuming purpose of athletic
programs. The better the team, the better the exposure, regardless
of the cost.''
   Reporting requirements recently set by the National Collegiate
Athletic Association are ``too limited,'' focusing only on the
big-money sports of football and basketball, said Rep. Ed Towns,
D-N.Y.
   ``Other sports must be covered as well,'' Towns said. ``If we can
report the on-time arrivals of airlines, surely we can let the
general public know whether or not students are getting a useful
degree at a university.''
   Too many high-school athletes dreaming of professional careers
enroll at major universities where they can't handle the academics,
said Rep. Tom McMillen, D-Md., a former college and NBA basketball
star.
   ``Unfortunately, most have a better chance of becoming a brain
surgeon than a professional athlete,'' he said. ``The dream is in
fact an impossible dream for most. We have a responsibility to these
young people ... to instill in them the concept that if they want to
punt on the field, they can't punt in the classroom.''
   ``It's a consumer rights bill for students,'' Goodling, who said
his interest, especially in the crime-statistics provision, arose
from the murder of Jeanne Clery, whose parents live in his district,
at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa., in 1986.
   ``The truth is students are raped, assaulted and murdered on
college campuses,'' he said. The bill won't solve those problems but
``can ensure students are as aware of crimes on campus as you and I
are of crimes in our neighborhoods or in the cities where we work,''
he said.

   The Securities and Exchange Commission would be
empowered to curb the practice of program trading during stock
market emergencies under legislation approved by the House.
   The Securities Markets Reform Act would allow the SEC to limit
program trading ``during periods of extraordinary market
volatility'' _ the sharp climbs or drops in stock prices.
   The measure, introduced last year, was adopted by the House on a
voice vote Tuesday.
   A similar market reform bill awaiting action by the Senate does
not contain a program trading curb.
   Critics of program trading _ rapid-fire transactions through
computerized buy and sell programs _ blame it for worsening the 1987
stock market crash and the 190-point market slide last Oct. 13.
   They are especially critical of one form of program trading,
index arbitrage, in which speculators try to take advantage of
small, brief price differences between the stock and futures markets
by simultaneously buying large orders in one market while selling
them in the other.
   Critics say that strategy and the volatility that often seems to
accompany it have driven small investors out of the stock market.
   Last March, the Treasury Department wrote the House Energy and
Commerce Committee opposing a program trading ban, saying the
measure's language was ``overly broad and potentially harmful'' to
market reform.
   But the measure was voted out of committee anyway on March 13.
   ``We are not talking about banning computers or legitimate
program trading strategies. Far from it,'' said Rep. Edward J.
Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the finance subcommittee that oversees
the SEC and one of the bill's coauthors.
   ``We are giving the SEC the tools to protect the securities
markets from manipulative trading strategies'' and to prohibit
trading tactics that ``threaten fair and orderly markets'' in times
of market volatility, he said.
   In addition to the program trading curb, the bipartisan bill:
   _Expands the authority of the SEC chairman to shut down the
securities markets, with the president's permission, in times of
market emergency.
   _Requires large securities traders to report their market
positions to the SEC.
   _Gives the SEC authority to assess the financial health of the
parent holding companies of broker-dealers.
   The collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the one-time junk
bond giant of Wall Street, was precipitated in February by the
failure of its parent holding company.
   SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden has complained that under current
law, the agency did not have adequate information about Drexel's
holding company before the firm's collapse and that information
about large stock trades was inadequate for government
decision-makers during the Oct. 13 market slide.
   The program trading amendment in the House bill would require the
SEC to determine _ through its often-lengthy rule-making process _
what types of activities cause or contribute to extraordinary
volatility before it could halt them.

<HEAD>Rebels Seize Rubber Plantation Offices, Effectively Close Airport</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rebel forces have seized the
headquarters of the world's largest rubber plantation, Liberia's
biggest employer, and are now believed to control every major
industrial concern in the country.
   On Tuesday, the insurgents gathered outside the gates of
Liberia's international airport _ 25 miles from the capital of
Monrovia _ after seizing the headquarters of the adjoining rubber
plantation. Their presence effectively closed the airport.
   President Samuel Doe met with religious leaders in an attempt at
peaceful negotiations to end the insurgency, which began in December
in northeastern Nimba County and became a serious challenge after
reported reprisals against civilians by government troops.
   Amnesty International says soldiers killed hundreds of civilians
from the Gio and Mano ethnic groups. The civil war has pitted
members of the Krahn and Mandingo groups, from which Doe draws
support, against the Gio and Mano peoples, who have largely backed
rebel leader Charles Taylor. Doe is a Krahn.
   The rebels took the headquarters of the 120,000-acre
Bridgestone-Firestone Inc. plantation Tuesday after attacking
government troops with mortars and automatic weapons.
   Plantation residents said dozens of rebels crossed the Farmington
River _ the last natural barrier before Monrovia _ and moved onto
the plantation.
   Diplomatic sources said about 15 or 20 soldiers briefly returned
fire, then fled toward the capital. It has become a familiar story
in the war, with some soldiers abandoning key posts before the rebel
advance.
   Diplomats say about 50 percent of a soldier corps they describe
as ill-trained and poorly paid have deserted. Government forces now
are believed to number about the same as the rebels _ 3,000 to 4,000.
   Monrovia residents have been fleeing in fear for nearly a week.
   Insurgents now control every major industrial concern in the West
African country of 2.5 million people, except possibly the Bong iron
ore mine, which has been cut off for days from Monrovia and believed
behind rebel lines.
   In Akron, Ohio, a spokesman for Bridgestone-Firestone Inc. said
the company wants to keep the plantation operating and that the
Americans operating it did not plan to evacuate.
   The spokesman, Trevor Hoskins, referred to the guerrillas as
``freedom fighters.'' He said the rebels occupied the management
offices in the company town of Harbel after surrounding the
plantation's factory late Monday, stopping rubber production.
   Hoskins said the rebels have told plantation managing director
Don Ensminger that ``the fight was not with him or the plantation
employees and they do not intend any destruction.'' The plantation
employs 8,500 Liberians and produces about 100 million pounds of
rubbers a year.
   Diplomatic sources in Monrovia, a city of about 400,000 people,
said they had no reports of casualties in fighting Tuesday. Late
Tuesday, Harbel residents said by telephone that there were reports
the rebels killed two Mandingo civilians. The reports could not be
independently confirmed.
   Rebels are accused of killing dozens of Mandingo and Krahns.
   Meanwhile, off Monrovia, four U.S. warships carrying 2,000
Marines remained ready to evacuate Americans and other foreigners,
including the 10 to 15 Soviet diplomats in Liberia, officials said.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said 33
Americans were evacuated Monday and thousands had left earlier. He
said 70 U.S. officials and about 1,200 private American citizens
remained.
   Washington has accused Taylor, the rebel leader, of getting
support from Libya, but it also has said U.S. Marines will not move
to support Doe, who seized power in a bloody coup 10 years ago.
   Most of the rebels entered Liberia from neighboring Ivory Coast
in late December. They accuse Doe's administration of corruption,
economic mismanagement and human rights abuses.
   Taylor had been a close aide of Doe, heading the government
agency responsible for disbursing public funds. He fled the country
after the Liberian leader accused him of stealing $1 million from
state coffers.
   Taylor denies the charges, but Doe says he will not negotiate
with a criminal.
   Descendants of freed U.S. slaves founded Liberia in 1822, and it
became black Africa's first independent country in 1847.

<HEAD>Committee Recommends Delay in Reopening Colorado Nuclear Weapons
Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Restarting production of nuclear weapons
components at the Rocky Flats plant near Denver should be delayed
until at least October, an advisory committee says.
   The Energy Department had tentatively planned to resume
production this month at the plant, which is the only source of
plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons.
   ``The committee believes that the necessary changes and training
will take significantly longer to complete than previously
forecast,'' said a letter to Energy Secretary James D. Watkins from
the department's advisory committee on nuclear facilities safety.
   ``So much remains to be done that restart on the schedule
indicated to us appears impractical,'' said the letter sent Monday
and signed by Chairman John F. Ahearne, a former member of the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
   A department official made portions of the letter available
Tuesday on condition of anonymity.
   In March, the department approved a plan by the contract operator
of the plant, EG&amp;G Inc., to resume production sometime in June, and
even if that date slipped a summer resumption has been expected.
Watkins has not given the final go-ahead, and his decision is
expected any day.
   The plant has been closed for safety and management improvements
since November, and the FBI has been investigating the handling of
nuclear waste there.
   The Navy has testified that if production at Rocky Flats is not
resumed soon, it will be unable to load the latest Trident 2
submarines with the most modern warhead, the W-88, atop the new D-5
missiles.

<TEXT>
   House Speaker Don Avenson on Tuesday won
a spirited, five-way Democratic contest for the right to oppose
two-term Republican Gov. Terry Branstad, who ran unopposed in his
party's primary.
   With 2,566 of 2,567 precincts reporting, Avenson had 78,767
votes, or 39 percent; to 63,129 votes, or 32 percent, for Attorney
General Tom Miller; and 52,031 votes, or 26 percent, for former
banker John Chrystal. Lt. Gov. Joann Zimmerman had 4,512 votes, or 2
percent, and retiree Darold Powers received 1,272 votes, or 1
percent.
   An Iowa Poll conducted for the Des Moines Register the last week
of the campaign showed Avenson leading with 32 percent of likely
Democratic voters, followed by Miller at 25 percent and Chrystal at
19 percent. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.9
percentage points.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The primary began as a referendum on abortion but became more
complicated in the closing days. Branstad focused on raising money
and had $2.5 million, more than double the combined total of the
Democratic field.
   Miller opposes abortion; Chrystal and Avenson are pro-choice.
Polls had shown a majority of voters considered themselves
pro-choice but abortion rights activists worried that two candidates
would split the vote.
   Branstad also opposes abortion.
   Avenson, 45, had the support of the National Organization for
Women and the National Abortion Rights Action League, which ran
television commercials and sent mail on his behalf.
   Miller, 45, charged that out-of-state special-interest groups
were trying to influence the outcome of the election.
   He discounted the abortion issue, saying he would approve only
limited restrictions, such as requiring parents be notified. Miller
sought to deflect attention by focusing on tighter restrictions
against drunken driving, and saying Avenson ``identifies with the
drunk driver.''
   Avenson called Miller's proposal ``insane'' and said it would
make criminals of people who have two beers. Chrystal, 64, urged the
two to talk about more serious issues, pushing his plan to improve
trade with the Soviet Union.
   The health of the candidates became an issue in the closing
weeks, when Avenson was hospitalized for emergency medical
procedures to clear a clogged artery in his heart.

<HEAD>Dems Cite Evidence That White House Aide Schemed Against Convention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats leaders say they have evidence suggesting
a White House aide pulled a political dirty trick and instigated a
police union protest that disrupted the party's state convention.
   The aide, Ron Kaufman, a special assistant to President Bush and
his deputy personnel director, denied he had anything to do with the
demonstration.
   The protest disrupted the Democratic convention Saturday at the
Springfield Civic Center, nearly forcing its cancellation.
   James Roosevelt, chief counsel for the state Democratic Party,
said suspicions of collusion by Kaufman have been bolstered by word
that Kaufman met a few weeks before the convention with the
president of the Springfield police union.
   ``I think what you have is some irresponsible police officers
working with a political operative who got carried away,'' Roosevelt
said.
   State Democratic officials said they would sue Kaufman, adding
his name to a Superior Court lawsuit already initiated against the
union.
   The Democrats claim the protest violated the civil rights of
party delegates, obstructing their ability to gather for a political
assembly.
   The union picketed outside the civic center for several hours.
Thousands of delegates refused to cross the picket line and remained
outside in wilting heat. Some delegates said they were manhandled by
police when they tried to enter.
   Democratic leaders insist the union broke an agreement not to
picket the convention hall, and they suspect Kaufman was the
instigator.
   ``Something inspired those police to break the agreement,''
Roosevelt said. The Democrats noted that the union endorsed George
Bush in the 1988 presidential election.
   Kaufman and state Republican Party Executive Director Alexander
Tennant were in Springfield during the convention. Tennant said the
two were meeting with delegates who might support Republicans in
November.
   Kaufman also acknowledged he had a brief conversation Friday
night with Robert Jacobson, president of the union. But Kaufman said
in a telephone interview Tuesday that he ``unequivocably'' had
nothing to do with the protest.
   Tennant said there was no evidence of a conspiracy, and he
accused the Democrats of trying to duck responsibility for their own
fiasco.
   On the evening before the demonstration, Kaufman said, he was in
front of the convention center and Jacobson showed him a squad car
that was in poor condition. ``That was the extent of it,'' he said.
   Kaufman also acknowledged that he met with Jacobson a few weeks
before the convention, but ``we did not talk anything about labor
movements in Springfield.''
   Jacobson said, ``I can categorically deny that I ever spoke to
Kaufman about this convention picket.''
   The union president insisted no politics were involved in the
police protest. The city has been mired in a labor dispute with its
police, and the union was threatening for weeks to picket the
convention center.
   On Friday night, however, officials announced an agreement under
which police would conduct only an informational picket if Mayor
Mary Hurley would not speak at the convention.The union claimed
Hurley broke the agreement by entering the convention hall Friday
night.
   ``They're making this out to be like it was Chicago '68,'' said
Jacobson, referring to the tumultuous Democratic national convention
22 years ago.

   A major toy distributor is recalling 16,000

   The Consumer Product Safety Commission said Tuesday that New
Jersey-based Toys ``R'' Us is voluntarily recalling its multicolored
plastic Music Master Xylophone toys because they contain ``lead in
excess of the allowable limit established by federal law.''
   The instruments were sold nationwide since 1988 and are labeled
``SX-305, SKN 421944, Shinnihon,'' the commission said.
   The agency said also that General Toys of Los Angeles was
recalling approximately 2,400 windup plastic toys because they may
pose both a fatal choking or puncture wound hazard to small children.
   The second recall includes: The Happy Flapping Car, models 8668
and 8228; The Happy Tricycle Police &amp; Thief Motorcycle, model 636;
Cycling Bear, model 6968; Naughty Bear, model 6976 and Ice Cream
Van, model 6973.
   The toys were sold nationwide before March of this year.
   The CPSC said there had been no reports of injuries involving any
of the toys.
   Consumers should take them away from children and return them to
the store where purchased for a refund, officials said.

<HEAD>Judge Considering Dismissing Secord Libel Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge is considering whether to
dismiss a $38 million libel suit filed against two journalists by
Iran-Contra figure Richard V. Secord.
   Lawyer Dean Ringel told Judge George H. Revercombe on Tuesday
that Secord's suit against Leslie and Andrew Cockburn and the
Atlantic Monthly Press should be dismissed because no actual malice
has been proved.
   But W. Michael Kramer, attorney for the former Air Force major
general, contended that the authors falsely linked Secord in a 1988
book to narcotics trafficking as part of the effort to finance the
Contra rebels.
   Kramer asked the judge for additional time to take depositions
and search for further evidence in the case.
   Revercombe took both motions under advisement.
   Kramer contended that the clear intent of the book, ``Out of
Control: The Story of the Reagan Administration's Secret War in
Nicaragua,'' was to exploit the Iran-Contra affair by putting the
administration and its key players in the worst possible light.
   Ringel argued that Secord ``seems to assume that since the book
takes a political position opposite to that of the previous
administration, that is evidence of malice.''

   Census officials say 87 percent of American

   Spokesman Ray Bancroft said the 90 percent level could be reached
within a week, but cautioned that ``the last 10 percent is the
hardest to count.''
   People who mailed back their census forms in March were the
easiest to tally, and census workers have added to that total by
visiting the homes of those who didn't get forms in the mail or
failed to send them back.
   Now they are trying to count people who are reluctant to

<TEXT>
   The campaign for Peru's presidential runoff
Sunday is passionate and angry. But poll-takers say voters' energies
are devoted more toward defeating the candidate they dislike than
electing someone they support.
   Many Peruvians are uneasy with both Mario Vargas Llosa, Peru's
celebrated novelist, and his opponent, Alberto Fujimori.
   Pollsters say each candidate inspires millions with emotions of
disappointment and distrust.
   ``At least half of Fujimori's supporters are people who are
scared of Vargas Llosa,'' said Alfredo Torres, of the polling firm
Apoyo. ``Of those who support Vargas Llosa, at least a third are
voting against Fujimori.''
   Polls show Fujimori with a slim but firm lead over Vargas Llosa,
a novelist-turned-politician who champions the free market. Most
polls show Fujimori, the son of Japanese immigrant parents, with a
5-point lead nationally.
   Vargas Llosa may have cut into that lead after his performance
Sunday night in a nationally broadcast debate with Fujimori. An
Apoyo poll of 1,080 television viewers in Lima and six other cities
showed Vargas Llosa winning 48 to 37 percent.
   The heated, 2{-hour debate was marked by personal attacks.
   Fujimori accused Vargas Llosa of spreading ``insults and
calumnies'' against him. The novelist said his opponent offered only
``generalities and banalities'' in his campaign.
   An agricultural engineer and former university rector with no
political experience, Fujimori was the surprise of first-round
elections April 8. He surged past seven opponents to nearly tie
Vargas Llosa.
   Vargas Llosa received 27.6 percent of the vote to Fujimori's 24.6
percent. A runoff was required because no candidate received a
majority.
   Vargas Llosa has detailed plans for resolving Peru's worst
economic crisis of the century and for battling a savage leftist
insurgency.
   Like Vargas Llosa, Fujimori favors getting back on good terms
with the international financial community by renewing payments on
Peru's $19 billion foreign debt.
   Vargas Llosa and Fujimori both advocate economic development
rather than police action to wean peasants away from Peru's
billion-dollar cocaine trade.
   Unlike the novelist, Fujimori has avoided discussing in detail
his plans to reverse Peru's slide into economic chaos and civil war.
   Vargas Llosa favors privatization of Peru's state-owned
companies, elimination of price controls and import barriers and an
economic ``shock'' program to combat inflation.
   Fujimori opposes all three and thereby scores points with workers
who fear for their jobs and with businesses that defend protective
trade laws.
   Vargas Llosa has questioned Fujimori's competence. Vargas Llosa's
allies say Fujimori is a puppet of the discredited left-of-center
Aprista Party of President Alan Garcia.
   Even the Roman Catholic Church has joined in. Upset that much of
Fujimori's support comes from Peru's small but growing evangelical
community, the Catholic church has attacked the evangelicals and
analysts say Fujimori is the real target.
   The campaign against Fujimori has received wide coverage by
Lima's pro-Vargas Llosa television stations. In little more than a
month the novelist turned a 13-point deficit into a 5-point lead
among voters in this city of 7 million.
   But for Vargas Llosa, the televised offensive has limits because
fewer than half of Peru's 22 million people have access to
television.
   The anti-Vargas Llosa sentiment is especially strong in Lima's
sprawling shantytowns and the impoverished countryside.
   In the brutal campaign for the first-round elections, Garcia's
Aprista Party painted the novelist as the candidate of the rich,
white elite.
   The effort was largely successful, according to pollsters.
   Vargas Llosa's harsh anti-left rhetoric also frightened away
potential supporters among Peru's traditionally left-leaning
electorate.
   The result is a voting population deeply split along class lines.
   Most of Vargas Llosa's gain has been among Lima's upper and
middle classes. The poor remain solidly opposed to him, apparently
unimpressed by the novelist's recent campaign sweeps through their
dusty shantytowns.
   ``The poor are going to vote for the `little chinaman,''' said
Ina Ramirez, 23, a sidewalk vendor of used clothing, referring to
Fujimori by his nickname. ``That other man is for the rich.''
   As Fujimori has become more aware of his constituency, his
rhetoric has become more populist. He promises to simultaneously
create hundreds of thousands of jobs and sharply cut Peru's 2,000
percent annual inflation. He doesn't say how he'll do it.
   The winner will inherit an economy ravaged by hyperinflation and
a bankrupt government paralyzed by strikes.
   And in recent years the Maoist Shining Path rebels have spread
from their mountain stronghold throughout much of Peru. Political
violence has claimed more than 18,500 lives over the past decade.

   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange recovered
from morning losses Wednesday ending higher, and the dollar rose
slightly against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar closed at 152.60 yen, up 0.17 yen from Tuesday's
152.43-yen finish. It opened at 152.45 yen and ranged between 152.27
yen and 152.60 yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average gained 31.88 points, or 0.1
percent, ending the day at 32,953.50. The index was a 74.53-point
loser at the end of the morning session before rebounding in the
afternoon. It rose 3.75 points the previous day.
   Traders said the index's fluctuation mainly resulted from
position adjustments ahead of the last trading day for June future
issues Thursday.
   Satoru Nagayoshi, a trader with New Japan Securities Co., said
the fluctuation in the stock index followed arbitrage selling and
buying by major securities companies in an attempt to take profits
between the spot and future markets.
   ``A majority of participants, however, remained on the sidelines
trying to avoid major moves,'' he said.
   Currency dealers said the yen-dollar rate was moving narrowly in
the absence of market-affecting news.
   Kouhei Kuroda, a dealer with Fuji Bank, said the dollar was
likely to stay in its current range until the release next week of
U.S. figures for consumer and producer prices for May.

   Former Gov. Bruce King, who has served
longer than any other New Mexico governor, on Tuesday defeated three
rivals for the Democratic nomination in his quest for a third term.
   Former state Rep. Frank Bond outpolled three other Republicans to
take his party's primary.
   King and Bond will meet in a Nov. 6 general election that will
provide the state with its first governor eligible to run for a
second, consecutive four-year term.
   King's closest opponent, former Attorney General Paul Bardacke,
conceded defeat shortly after 9 p.m.
   With 1,267 of 1,400 precincts reporting, King had 82,270 votes,
or 52 percent, to 61,917 votes, or 39 percent for Bardacke; 7,484
votes, or 5 percent, for former Supreme Court Justice Tony
Scarborough; and 5,616 votes, or 4 percent, for former Economic
Development Secretary Bob Gold.
   In the Republican primary, Bond had 41,241 votes, or 55 percent,
to 25,113 votes, or 34 percent, for state Senate Republican Leader
Les Houston; 4,252 votes, or 6 percent for state Sen. James Caudell;
and 4,069 votes, or 5 percent, for former Albuquerque Mayor Harry
Kinney, with 1,263 precincts reporting of 1,400.
   In other races, U.S. Sen. Pete Domenici won the Republican
nomination in an uncontested primary, as did Democratic state Sen.
Tom Benavides.
   Tom Udall, son of former Arizona congressman and former Interior
Secretary Stewart Udall, defeated three fellow Albuquerque lawyers
for the Democratic nomination for state attorney general.
   With 1,206 precincts of 1,400 reporting, Udall had 49,229 votes,
or 36 percent, to 42,275 votes, or 31 percent, for former state
District Judge Patricia Madrid; 25,142 votes, or 18 percent, for
state Rep. Dick Minzner; and 21,904 votes, or 16 percent for Patrick
Apodaca, former associate counsel to President Carter.

   New Mexico governors used to serve two-year terms. The term was
doubled to four years in 1970, but with the proviso that no one
could serve a second consecutive term.
   King, a 66-year-old rancher and businessman, served from 1971-75
and 1979-83. He offered voters the experience of 36 years in
politics. Bardacke, 45, pushed youth and new ideas, urging New
Mexicans to ``choose the future.''
   The Republican race featured a contrast between Houston's
rough-and-tumble style and Bond's positive leadership theme.
   Houston, 54, has been a flamboyant figure in legislative politics
for the past decade. Bond, 46, offered a continuation of the upbeat
style of incumbent Republican Gov. Garrey Carruthers, who is barred
by the old law from seeking a second consecutive term.

   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl says a
reunified Germany will be anything but neutral and isolationist,
instead seeking a central role in a new European security order.
   In his first speech since the superpower summit, Kohl also
forcefully reiterated his commitment to a united Germany maintaining
close ties with the United States through NATO membership.
   ``We do not want to be forced into isolation because our
experience shows that this leads to a loss of stability and peace in
Europe,'' he told about 5,000 people Tuesday night at a dinner held
by the 38-year-old American Council on Germany.
   ``We do not seek neutrality or demilitarization, and we reject a
non-aligned status,'' said Kohl. He called continued close ties with
the United States ``of vital importance'' to the Germans.
   Kohl acknowledged the anxiety _ most strongly expressed by
Soviets _ over a strong and united German state of 80 million people
at the heart of Europe. The Soviet Union lost 20 million people in
World War II.
   ``This has been a terrible century, with wars, with tears and the
Germans had a part in this,'' the West German leader said.
   But he said, ``Let me tell you, you can trust the Germans.'' He
said they want a central role in creating a Europe of closer
economic and political cooperation.
   ``We Germans are determined to go this road so we can prove that
we have learned the lessons of history,'' Kohl said. ``Peace must
emanate from the soil of Germany.''
   Kohl arrived in the United States on Tuesday for a four-day
visit. He was to meet with Wall Street executives today, deliver the
commencement address at Harvard University on Thursday day and meet
with President Bush at the White House on Friday.
   While reiterating his commitment to NATO, Kohl expressed
gratitude to Bush for ``clearly stating'' _ with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev at his side on Sunday _ that ``it is the right
of the Germans that they should alone determine what alliance they
want to be a member of.''
   The Soviet Union opposes the membership of a reunified Germany in
the Western military alliance, and the Soviet and U.S. leaders made
little progress on the issue during the Washington summit.
   Kohl offered no new proposals on how to satisfy Soviet concerns.
The stalemate is stymying progress on the reduction of conventional
and nuclear forces in Europe, including the withdrawal of the
380,000 Soviet troops from East Germany.
   He noted that Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia endorse a united
Germany's membership in NATO as promoting European security. All
three are in the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact, a military alliance that is
falling apart now that its members are stripping the Communists of
power.
   Kohl expressed support for proposals endorsed by Soviet leaders
for a stronger role for the 35-nation Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe as a forum for greater understanding and
cooperation among nations.
   U.S. officials have expressed concern that a stronger CSCE could
supplant NATO and the Warsaw Pact, and Kohl stressed that he did not
envision the Western alliance crumbling as a result.

   Buddy, can you spare a dime? And three pennies?
   Things are nowhere near that bad for Donald Trump, but the
fabulously wealthy developer recently cashed a 13-cent check to
become co-winner of Spy magazine's search for ``America's cheapest
zillionaire.''
   Trump and fellow multimillionaire Adnan Khashoggi _ a man with
his own problems _ were the only two of 13 well-to-do sorts stung by
the satirical magazine.
   Spy created a legally incorporated company, the National Refund
Clearinghouse, and opened a checking account. The magazine then
zipped out refund checks of $1.11 to 58 ``well-known, well-heeled
Americans.''
   Twenty-six people _ including Khashoggi, Trump, Cher, Harry
Helmsley, Michael Douglas, Shirley MacLaine and Kurt Vonnegut _
cashed the checks. Woody Allen, Dustin Hoffman, Billy Joel and John
McEnroe were among those who did not.
   The magazine went back to the people who cashed the check, then
sent each one a 64-cent check to cover a ``computer error.''
Thirteen people cashed these, including Trump and Khashoggi,
prompting a showdown for the title.
   All 13 received a third check, this one for 13 cents; only Trump
and Khashoggi cashed them. Khashoggi, who is on trial with Imelda
Marcos in federal court, personally endorsed his check.
   ``These habits of thriftiness will stand these men in good stead
when they are behind bars or out in the street and find it necessary
to assemble the funds to buy cigarettes or a cheese sandwich,'' the
magazine said.
   Trump's lenders in recent days have raised concern that his
holdings, which include hotels, casinos and airplanes, aren't
generating enough cash to support his empire's debts.

<HEAD>Leaders Urge People to Question Communist Party, Reject Political
Pluralism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leaders of Albania say the ruling
Communist Party now stands ready to accept criticism and advice from
the people, but they ruled out ending the party's political monopoly.
   Albania's state-run ATA news agency, in a dispatch from the
country's capital of Tirana Tuesday, quoted remarks by Communist
Party leader Ramiz Alia and Nexhmija Hoxa, widow of Enver Hoxa, the
founder of Communist Albania.
   It quoted the two as urging the country's Communist-dominated
Democratic Front mass organization to be more independent of the
ruling party.
   The country's leaders have in recent weeks begun to move away
from the rigid Stalinism that has made Albania the most controlled
and isolated country in Europe during the postwar period.
   Like similar organizations set up elsewhere in Eastern Europe
where Communists consolidated power after World War II, the
Democratic Front was set up in Albania ostensibly to give
non-Communists a forum.
   But in Albania, the Front's real function was to endorse
Communist policies.
   Ms. Hoxa, the Front's chairwoman, was quoted by ATA as saying
that Albanians ``are invited to the open party meetings, with the
right of demanding explanations and discussing on an equal footing
with the Communists.''
   ``The fact that the masses are invited and urged not only to have
their say, but to have the power to make decisions, testified to the
great political trust the party has in them,'' she was quoted as
saying.
   In separate comments, Alia urged Front members to show more
independence, saying ``it is only natural that there will be a
diversity of opinions, even a pluralist treatment'' of issues within
the organization, the agency said.
   Ms. Hoxha, however, drew clear lines as to how far pluralism
could go, rejecting ``artificially created parties, which represent
nobody,'' ATA said.
   Albania has moved this spring to reform some of the most
restrictive aspects of its social and economic system, while
pledging to open itself more to the outside world.
   Officials have said that travel abroad _ difficult if not
impossible for decades _ would be made freer for average citizens.
   They also abolished the death penalty for those trying to flee
the country, and announced they were seeking to establish ties to
European organizations and mend relations with the superpowers.
   Religion, officially banned for decades, has again become
acceptable. Ms. Hoxha emphasized the new stance at the meeting, ATA
said, quoting her as saying ``the right to believe or not is a
matter of conscience for everybody.''

<HEAD>Avenson Wins Democratic Nomination to Oppose Branstad</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Don Avenson rode a
pro-choice abortion campaign to the Democratic nomination for
governor, foreshadowing a general election debate on abortion with
Republican Gov. Terry Branstad.
   ``You have nominated yourself a tiger, a tiger for the ordinary
people,'' Avenson told cheering supporters as he claimed victory in
Tuesday's primary.
   Avenson outdistanced an anti-abortion Democrat, Attorney General
Tom Miller, and another pro-choice candidate, former banker John
Chrystal. Avenson was strongly supported by pro-choice groups.
   With 99 percent of the state's precincts reporting, Avenson had
78,767 votes, or 39 percent, to Miller's 63,129, or 32 percent, and
Chrystal's 52,031, or 26 percent. Two minor candidates split the
remainder.
   Chrystal said the pro-choice groups, particularly the National
Abortion Rights Action League, had made the difference for Avenson.
``NARAL's endorsement really brought votes to Avenson,'' Chrystal
said.
   Branstad opposes abortion and faced no primary contest.
   Avenson said he will turn immediately to the uphill fight in
November. He conceded that Branstad has a huge financial edge.
Branstad has raised more than $2.5 million, while Avenson is
essentially broke. He said he has pledges for $65,000 to begin the
fight.
   Branstad responded to the primary results by sounding a theme
likely to be repeated this fall _ that Avenson had won with the help
of a ``typical special-interest type of support.''
   Miller urged his backers to unite behind Avenson, and all three
Democratic candidates called for party unity.
   ``Put the primary behind us _ it's over,'' Miller said. ``I'll do
anything I can to help win this campaign, to win the governor's
race. This is the end of one campaign but the beginning of another.''
   Shelley Bain, of the Iowa NARAL affiliate, said voters will now
have a choice over abortion policy in the November governor's race.
Still, she insisted that other issues had played a role in Avenson's
victory.
   Abortion, she said, ``was important, but it wasn't everything.''
   Abortion foes discounted the election, saying Miller waffled on
the issue and didn't make a strong appeal.
   ``Tom Miller was really, at best, a weak candidate from the
pro-life standpoint,'' said Mona Smit of the Iowa Right to Life
Committee. ``Our position is NARAL didn't beat Miller, Tom Miller
beat Tom Miller.''

   U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley looked ahead to his
fall campaign against Republican challenger Christine Todd Whitman
after swamping an unknown in the Democratic primary.
   With 5,290 of 5,845 precincts reporting in Tuesday's Democratic
primary, the two-term senator had 176,213 votes, or 93 percent, to
14,235 votes, or 7 percent, for Daniel Seyler.
   Mrs. Whitman, who was unopposed, drew 98,153 votes with 5,289
precincts reporting.
   Bradley indicated Tuesday night that he was taking nothing for
granted despite being the overwhelming favorite in the general
election and having amassed a $10 million-plus warchest, 75 percent
of it from out of state.
   ``You take every race you're in seriously, just like you took
every game you were in seriously,'' said the former New York Knicks
basketball star.
   The surprise of the primary was the 12th District GOP upset in
the battle to succeed retiring Rep. James Courter, who decided not
to run for re-election after losing the gubernatorial race to
Democrat Jim Florio.
   Former New York Giants wide receiver Phil McConkey pulled into
second place, dividing the moderate vote and allowing state Sen.
Richard A. Zimmer _ a fiscal conservative and environmentalist _ to
defeat the favorite, Assemblymen Rodney Frelinghuysen, and grab the
party nomination.
   Zimmer will face Democrat Marguerite Chandler on the November
ballot.
   Camden Democrat Robert Andrews easily won a four-way contest for
the nomination to seek Florio's congressional seat in the 1st
District.
   He faces Gloucester County Freeholder Daniel Mangini, who ran
unopposed for the GOP nomination, in November.
   Andrews also won the party's nomination to run in the special
election to serve the rest of Florio's eighth term, which ends in
January.
   Mrs. Whitman has vowed to run a clean, issues-oriented race, but
some political observers believe her campaign could tarnish Bradley
as a future presidential contender.
   Bradley, 46, continued to sidestep talk that he might seek the
Democratic presidential nomination in 1992, saying he planned to
serve out his six-year Senate term if he wins re-election.
   During the primary campaign, Mrs. Whitman, 43, focused on
Bradley's campaign spending. She expects to spend $1.5 million.
   Mrs. Whitman entered her first race for statewide elected office
after the state GOP took a battering in last year's gubernatorial
election, but denied she agreed to run in exchange for party support
in a future bid for governor.

   Montana Republicans tapped Lt. Gov. Allen
Kolstad to challenge Democratic U.S. Sen. Max Baucus, who brushed
aside his primary opposition but said he's taking nothing for
granted in November.
   Baucus, raised more than $2 million in campaign money even before
Tuesday's primary victory, but recalled the 1988 upset of Democratic
Sen. John Melcher by upstart Republican Conrad Burns.
   ``One never takes anything for granted _ ever,'' said Baucus, 48.
   Kolstad, a 58-year-old farmer-rancher and 20-year veteran of
Montana politics, bested three rivals in a hotly contested GOP
primary.
   With 98 percent of 967 precincts reporting early today, Kolstad
had 36,897 votes, or 43 percent; to 30,451 votes, or 36 percent, for
scientist-businessman Bruce Vorhauer; 11,484, or 13 percent, for
state Sen. Bill Farrell; and 6,525, or 8 percent, for businessman
John Domenech.
   Kolstad promised a campaign that would ``keep Senator Baucus up
against the ropes right from the beginning.''
   ``We're just going to have to outwork him,'' he said. ``We're
used to putting in a lot of 16- and 18-hour days on the ranch. We're
going to convert that energy into the campaign.''
   Baucus had 79,131 votes, or 83 percent, to 12,444 votes, or 13
percent for state Public Service Commissioner John Driscoll; and
4,321 votes, or 5 percent, for evangelist Curly Thornton.
   Kolstad was recruited by national Republicans, including
President Bush and former President Reagan. Baucus, pointing to the
national GOP involvement, predicted that Kolstad's campaign would be
run from Washington.
   Kolstad, emphasized his farming background and his lifelong ties
to Montana. The emphasis also was a slap at Vorhauer, who moved his
legal residence to Montana only last fall.
   Vorhauer, 48, is best known as the inventor of the Today
contraceptive sponge. His campaign stressed his engineering and
science background as qualifying him to bring high-tech businesses
to the state.
   Farrell, 41, who operates a small independent trucking firm,
touted his working-man image. Domenech, 36, campaigned for a
national health plan.
   Baucus ran a quiet primary campaign, with neither of his
challengrs having much in the way of money or organizations.

<HEAD>N.J. School-Funding System Deemed Unfair; Texas Closer to Overhaul</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL MOKRZYCKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   New Jersey joined a dozen states where courts have struck down
school-funding systems for shortchanging the poor. In one of those
states, Texas, an education-finance overhaul package was speeding
through the Legislature.
   In a 7-0 ruling Tuesday, New Jersey's Supreme Court ordered
lawmakers to ensure by the 1991-92 school year that poor districts
are able to spend about as much per student as wealthier districts
in the 1.3 million-student system.
   The decision is widely expected to force lawmakers to raise
taxes, as has happened in Kentucky, Arkansas, Wyoming and other
states. Texas' House and Senate approved tax increases Tuesday.
   The wave of court orders rejecting the way states fund schools is
a legacy of the rich-get-richer, poor-get-poorer 1980s, one expert
said.
   ``Since 1980, the gap between rich districts and poor districts
has been increasing, that's why we have this trend. The poor are
more hard-pressed than they were during the 1970s,'' said Arthur
Wise, director of the Washington-based RAND Center for the Study of
the Teaching Profession.
   In most states, schools are supported primarily by local property
taxes. The New Jersey court found the setup unconstitutional. It
ruled, in effect, that determining school funding based on property
tax revenue is unfair.
   ``The evidence compels but one conclusion: the poorer the
district and the greater its need, the less the money available, and
the worse the education,'' Chief Justice Robert N. Wilentz wrote.
``These students simply cannot possibly enter the same market or the
same society as their peers educated in wealthier districts.''
   The court estimated the state needs to add $440 million to its
$3.5 billion schools budget to end the disparities. Lawmakers may
devise any remedy they wish but cannot force poor districts to raise
property taxes, the court said.
   Gov. Jim Florio called the ruling ``a clear victory for the
children of New Jersey.''
   ``The court has recognized that the current school funding system
is leading us to be two New Jerseys _ where some youngsters head for
the best colleges, and others go down a road to nowhere,'' he said.
   The governor last week unveiled a plan to increase income taxes
to raise $1 billion for more aid to middle-income and poor
districts. Under the plan, aid to wealthier school systems would be
reduced or eliminated.
   State supreme courts in Montana, Kentucky and Texas have struck
down school-funding systems in the past 18 months. Courts also have
overturned funding systems in Kansas, Wisconsin, California,
Connecticut, Washington, West Virginia, Wyoming and Arkansas.
Lawsuits are pending in several other states, including Alaska,
Connecticut and Oregon.
   ``I think we are re-entering a period of school finance
litigation,'' said Chris Pipho, director of state relations for the
Denver-based Education Commission of the States.
   The Texas Supreme Court in October declared that state's system
unconstitutional, and lawmakers have been meeting under a court
deadline since February to devise a remedy.
   On Tuesday the Senate approved and sent to the House a $528
million education reform bill. And both chambers passed a bill that
would raise sales taxes by a quarter-cent and increase taxes on
mixed drinks and tobacco to pay for the reforms.
   The Kentucky Supreme Court overturned that state's funding system
last year, forcing lawmakers to raise taxes to pay for $500 million
more in education aid.
   The Education Law Center in Newark, N.J., filed the lawsuit in
1981 that led to Tuesday's ruling on behalf of children in such poor
areas as Camden, Jersey City and East Orange. Former Gov. Thomas H.
Kean had fought the lawsuit and defended the funding system.
   The court found that in 1984, New Jersey districts spent an
average of $4,030 per pupil, while the poorest school systems spent
only about $2,860 per pupil.
   ``The fact is that a large part of our society is disintegrating,
so large a part that it cannot help but affect the rest,'' the court
said. ``Everyone's future is at stake, and not just the poor's.''

<HEAD>Stock Index Gains Against Yen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index, recovering
from a morning setback, closed slightly higher today, while the
dollar gained against the Japanese yen for the seventh consecutive
trading day.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average gained 31.88 points, or 0.1
percent, closing at 32,953.50. The index, which rose 3.75 points
Tuesday, was down 74.53 points at the end of the morning session
before rebounding in the afternoon.
   Traders said investors mainly were making position adjustments on
the eve of the last trading day for June futures issues.
   Yoshiro Inoue, an analyst with Nomura Securities Co., said most
market players avoided major moves other than position adjustments.
   ``Transactions in the spot market were relatively small as many
market players are now selling June futures issues and buying
September issues. As long as arbitrage selling of spot issues is not
involved, there is little negative impact on the Nikkei,'' he said.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 600 million shares,
unchanged from Tuesday.
   The dollar's stability above 152 yen also contributed to the
relative inacticity, Inoue added.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 152.60 yen, up 0.17
yen from Tuesday's 152.43-yen finish. It opened at 152.45 yen and
ranged between 152.27 yen and 152.60 yen.
   The dollar now has gained 3.15 yen in the last seven days,
although it has moved only slightly in the last few days.
   ``Market players were mainly trading the yen and the West German
mark,'' said Eiichi Seino, a dealer with Fuji Bank.
   ``Market players generally believe the U.S. economy is slowing
down and are reluctant to buy the dollar, but participants are
inclined to pick up the currency whenever it falls near the 152-yen
line,'' he said.
   Seino said the dollar-yen will remain within the 152-153 yen
range until next week's scheduled announcement of a series of U.S.
economic data.
   Some $7.53 billion changed hands in spot trading.
   The price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese government
bonds slipped to 87.81 points at 5 p.m. (4 a.m. EDT) from Tuesday's
88.11-point finish. The yield rose to 6.990 percent from the
previous day's 6.945 percent.

   A pair of earthquakes damaged homes and
caused landslides on Vanuatu's Mere Lava Island, Radio Vanuatu
reported.
   There were no reports of casualties in the quake Tuesday. A
Richter scale measurement of the quake's force was not immediately
available.
   Davidson Lilip, secretary to the Banks-Torres local government
council, said today that most of the damage was at Tasmat village,
where about 400 people live.
   He said most of the damage was caused by the second, stronger
earthquake, which followed the first temblor by about 90 minutes. He
added that a series of aftershocks was keeping residents' nerves on
edge.
   Vanuatu is a double chain of about 80 islands some 1,350 miles
northeast of Sydney, Australia.

   The fall campaign for governor will be a
generational contest between former Gov. Bruce King, a Democrat
who's already the state's longest-serving governor, and a younger
Republican, Frank Bond.
   Each of the men, who are both ranchers and businessmen, defeated
three rivals Tuesday to win their parties' nominations.
   Incumbent Gov. Garrey Carruthers, a Republican, is prohibited by
state law from seeking a second term in the Nov. 6 general election.
   In a victory speech, the 66-year-old King stressed that he
``won't need any on-the-job training, so we'll begin immediately to
doing the things that need to be done for all of the people of New
Mexico.''
   He served two four-year terms as governor, from 1971 to 1975 and
from 1979 to 1983.
   Bond, 46, set the tone of his campaign with remarks in which he
promised younger, fresher leadership. ``We don't want to turn back
any political clock,'' he said.
   King held off former Attorney General Paul Bardacke in the
four-way Democratic contest. With all but 38 of the state's 1,400
precincts reporting, he had 91,330 votes to Bardacke's 68,190, a
52-to-39 percent margin.
   Bond trounced state Senate Republican leader Les Houston by 55
percent to 33 percent. With all but 42 of the state's 1,400
precincts reporting, Bond had 44,047 votes to Houston's 26,595 votes.
   Also in the primary, Tom Udall, the son of former Arizona
congresman and Interior Secretary Stewart Udall, was nominated as
the Democratic candidate for attorney general. He will run against
Republican state Sen. Bill Davis, who was unopposed in Tuesday's
primary.
   Under a change in the state constitution, the governor elected in
November will be the first allowed to run for a second, consecutive
four-year term. Since 1970, governors were limited to one four-year
term in a row; before that, New Mexico governors served two-year
terms.

<HEAD>Soviets Reassure North Koreans on Ties with South</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet government news agency has sought to
reassure North Korea that the Kremlin will not let its relations
with the Communist state be damaged by Soviet moves to establish
ties with South Korea.
   Tass said in a commentary Tuesday that Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
meeting with President Roh Tae-woo of South Korea had been described
by Western media as a ``political sensation'' marking ``drastic
changes'' in Moscow's Asia policy.
   The commentary, by political analyst Yuri Kornilov, did not
specify which news outlets were making those claims.
   Roh told reporters after meeting the Soviet leader in San
Francisco Monday that the two countries would establish diplomatic
ties.
   But Gorbachev was vague on the prospects of South Korean-Soviet
ties, saying only, ``We will let the fruit grow ripe, and when the
fruit grows ripe, we will eat it.''
   The Tass commentary was an effort to reassure North Korea that
the Soviet Union has no intention of doing anything to hurt its
relations with the Communist state, which is ruled by Kim Il Sung.
   Kornilov said the Roh-Gorbachev meeting was a sensation only
because it was the first between leaders of the Soviet Union and
South Korea _ not because it signals any change in Soviet policy.
   ``As to prospects for the establishment of diplomatic relations,
of which much is being written and said in the West nowadays, the
Soviet stand is well known and remains unchanged: this issue can be
considered only in connection with further improvement of the
situation in the Korean peninsula.''
   Kornilov continued:
   ``Of course, the removal of ideological blinkers from our foreign
policy and the course towards broader economic contacts and
political dialogue with other countries in no way means that we give
up our principled positions and priorities or forgo the interests of
third countries.''
   And he reassured North Korea, ``Our country will continue to
maintain and promote in all ways its traditionally close political,
economic and other ties'' with North Korea.
   The Tass analyst said the Soviet Union continues to support North
Korean proposals for peace on the peninsula.
   Korea was divided in 1945 at the end of World War II, when Soviet
and U.S. Troops ended Japan's colonial rule. The division deepened
after the two Koreas fought a war in 1950-53.
   In South Korea, newspapers reported today that the country's
foreign minister, Choi Ho-Joong, plans to visit Moscow next month to
discuss terms of establishing formal ties.
   Dong-A Ilbo and Joong-ang Ilbo, in dispatches by correspondents
who accompanied Roh on his U.S. visit, said Choi plans to meet
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze. They said Shevardnadze
would then be invited to visit Seoul about a month later to finalize
terms for opening formal diplomatic relations.
   Roh was to meet with President Bush in Washington today.
   Despite the lack of diplomatic relations, South Korea and the
Soviet Union have greatly increased trade and investment in recent
years.
   Their trade jumped 10 times from 1985 to $600 million last year
and is expected to top $1 billion this year.

<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The corporate merger of the northern and
southern branches of the Presbyterian Church in 1983 has become a
theological merger.
   Cheers rang out at the Salt Palace in this Mormon heartland after
commissioners to the 202nd General Assembly of the Presbyterian
Church (U.S.A.) approved 499-25 a new statement of faith Tuesday
that combines traditional Christian beliefs with contemporary
concerns for the environment and sexual equality.
   ``For the first time, this denomination speaks for itself as a
theological body. That to me is of epochal significance,'' said the
Rev. M. Douglas Harper, a Houston pastor who served on the drafting
committee.
   If the document is approved by two-thirds of the denomination's
177 regional presbyteries and again by the 1991 General Assembly, it
will become the 11th statement of faith in the 2.9 million-member
church's Book of Confessions.
   The new statement of faith is the denomination's first since the
merger healed a 122-year-old split dating to the Civil War and the
slavery issue.
   ``As far as we know, this is the first confession of the church
that declares as a matter of faith women are called to all
ministries of the church,'' said Jane Dempsey Douglass,
vice-chairwoman of the drafting committee.
   The confession also likens God to both a mother who will not
forsake her nursing child and a father ``who runs to welcome the
prodigal home.''
   On the environment, the confession says humans deserve God's
condemnation for the way they ``threaten death to the planet
entrusted to our care.''
   At the same time, the statement upholds centuries-old church
teachings that Jesus Christ was both fully human and fully God, and
that God raised Jesus from the dead to offer eternal life.
   Some church leaders said the confession is vital for the
denomination, which has lost a third of its members in the past
quarter century amid criticism it lacked a strong identity.
   ``The theological integrity of the Presbyterian Church depends on
the statement of faith,'' said the Rev. Jack L. Stotts, chairman of
the committee that developed the confession.
   In other business, the assembly voted to allocate $1 million for
a five-year program to set up self-help programs for black men. The
church is less than 2 percent black.
   The church leaders also voted 395-52 to work toward normalized
relations with Cuba, including reducing trade and travel
restrictions. A call for free elections there was defeated.

   Prosecutors today weighed criminal
charges against a doctor who hooked an Alzheimer's patient to a
poison-injecting suicide machine that let her take her life with the
press of a button.
   Janet Adkins, a 54-year-old Portland, Ore., woman, died Monday
after traveling 2,000 miles to use the device built by Dr. Jack
Kevorkian, a retired pathologist and outspoken advocate of what he
calls doctor-assisted suicide.
   ``Her last words to me were something like, `Thank you, thank you
very much,''' he said. ``I wished her a good trip, and as I leaned
over her she seemed like she was rising to meet me, perhaps to give
me a kiss of gratitude.''
   The 62-year-old suburban Detroit doctor also said the woman told
him, ``You just make my case known.''
   As it became known, prosecutors considered whether it was illegal
and medical professionals debated whether it was ethical.
Prosecutors seized the machine and said they would seek a court
order today banning use of the device while the case is considered.
   ``There are many issues here,'' County Prosecutor Richard
Thompson said Tuesday. ``Suicide is not a crime in Michigan. ... But
it's not the desire of the deceased that's in question, it's the
actions of those involved.''
   Case law in Michigan is unclear on whether assisting a suicide is
a crime, Thompson said. In Oregon, providing the means to commit
suicide is a felony.
   Mrs. Adkins' husband called the device humane and said his wife
had the right to take her life.
   ``She loved life. She just lived life to the fullest,'' Ron
Adkins said Tuesday in Portland. ``She was a powerful woman and she
was an intelligent woman. I was the weak one. She was strong. She
had made up her mind.''
   Adkins released a note his wife had written: ``I have Alzheimer's
disease and do not want to let it progress any farther. I don't
choose to put my family or myself through the agony of this terrible
disease.''
   One of the couple's three sons, Neil, told KGW-TV in Portland,
``She was in a very good state of mind, that's the amazing thing. It
was not a desperate thing or a depressed situation. She was the one
that helped us all through it.''
   Diana Smith of the Hemlock Society, which advocates suicide
rights, said: `It's unfortunate that Mrs. Adkins had to go so far to
get the assistance she desired.'' Smith said Kevorkian used Michigan
as a testing ground because it is the only state that doesn't have
specific laws against assisting a suicide.
   Some ethicists said the doctor acted in violation of the
Hippocratic Oath.
   ``Physicians should not be killers, even in cases where the
patient requests it and there is a compassionate reason behind the
act,'' said Susan Wolf of the Hastings Center for biomedical
research in Briarcliff, N.Y.
   ``They take an oath to do no harm, and taking a life is doing
harm.''
   Kevorkian said the Adkinses, members of the National Hemlock
Society, traveled to Michigan with a friend on Friday. On Monday, he
drove her in his van to a park. Her husband stayed behind at the
couple's motel.
   ``She was anxious and didn't want to delay,'' Kevorkian said.
``But she was the calm _ the calmest one involved with the
procedure. I can tell you from experience, it was rough.''
   Kevorkian said he and one of his relatives attached Mrs. Adkins
to a heart monitor, then put an intravenous tube in her arm. The
machine consists of a motor and an aluminum frame from which tubes
of chemicals are suspended.
   The tube first delivered a saline solution. Kevorkian said Mrs.
Adkins then pressed a button that injected thiopental, a
coma-inducing drug, followed moments later by potassium chloride,
which stops the heart within minutes.
   He said she was unconscious in 25 seconds and died in five or six
minutes.
   After Mrs. Adkins' death, Kevorkian notified police, who
confiscated both his Volkswagen van and the device.
   Mrs. Adkins was diagnosed with Alzheimer's a year ago and decided
then she would end her life, her 57-year-old husband said.
Alzheimer's is a degenerative brain and nerve disorder that robs
people of their memories and their ability to function. An estimated
4 million U.S. adults, mostly over age 65, have the disease.
   Kevorkian said he developed the device last fall, inspired by a
quadriplegic in Michigan who fought 18 years for the right to die.
He died last year.
   The doctor said in March that he expected to be prosecuted after
the first use of the device. He also said he would not charge
patients and that he might use it to take his own life some day.
   ``It's dignified, humane and painless, and the patient can do it
in the comfort of their own home at any time they want,'' he said
last year.
   ``I'm here to help anybody who's in distress, or thinks he is. I
couldn't let dogs suffer like that, how can I let a human?''

<HEAD>Striking Canadian Truckers Reject Offer; Border Blockades Removed</HEAD>

   More than 1,500 independent
British Columbia truckers shouted down a settlement offer, putting
back into gear a strike that has slowed deliveries of food and fuel
across the U.S. border.
   The truckers warned of new forms of protest, after a court
injunction forced them to stop using their rigs to block border
crossings.
   The settlement offer was presented to more than 1,500 truckers
Tuesday night at a fairground in this Vancouver suburb. The truckers
didn't even bother using ballots they were handed and overwhelmingly
shouted the offer down.
   More talks were set for today. There are about 3,000 independent
truckers in British Columbia, about one-quarter of all truckers in
the province.
   The proposal, crafted with help from a mediator, would have set a
minimum hauling rate of $35 an hour, going up to $40 by January. The
truckers want $40 now.
   The independents, who pay their own running costs and maintain
their vehicles, are paid $26 to $35 an hour.
   Earlier Tuesday, truckers removed their rigs blocking most
commercial traffic at the border between Washington state and
British Columbia. The drivers were served with an injunction late
Monday.
   The blockades had been in place since Thursday at crossings north
of Blaine, Oroville, Sumas and Lynden in Washington, and at two
major Canadian highways.
   The blockades were the most serious in a series of escalating job
actions since independent truckers went on strike in late May. The
roadblocks resulted in food and fuel shortages in the province and
in Point Roberts, a small Washington state peninsula accessible
overland only through British Columbia.
   The blockades also forced a Burnaby truck manufacturer to lay off
450 employees Monday for lack of parts from the United States.
   Garnet Zimmerman, a spokesman for the Teamsters union, which
supports striking members of the Western Owner-Operators
Association, said new job actions are planned.
   Organizers want truckers to set up protests at highway scale
stations, travel in convoys or gather their rigs at shopping malls
to tell the public about their wage demands, he said.
   Teamsters official Don McGill blamed the breakdown on several
large trucking companies that he said have refused to come to the
bargaining table.
   About one-third of the 180 trucking companies in the dispute have
been represented during talks. McGill said the truckers want all
firms included in any contract.
   Last month, independent truckers in Ontario and Quebec blocked
border crossings, costing the Big Three automakers millions of
dollars and threatening food shortages. The blockades were part of
the truckers' fight for higher rates.

   Thunderstorms lingered in the northern and central Plains early
today, and dry weather prevailed across much of the rest of the
nation.
   Rain fell in the Northwest and along Lake Erie. Parts of the
Northeast had cool overnight temperatures.
   Thunderstorms were expected across the upper Midwest into the New
England mountains. Scattered thunderstorms are also likely along the
Gulf coast and Florida. Rain and stormy weather were likely in the
lower Ohio Valley.
   In the desert Southwest, temperatures were expected to pass 110
degrees for the third time this week, and the upper Plains also were
to be unseasonably hot.
   The West was expected to be dry, with clear skies, except for
showers in parts of the Northwest. Overcast skies were forecast east
of the Mississippi, with the exception of a swath across the Deep
South.
   On Tuesday, a powerful late spring storm swept across the central
and eastern United States. Rain and thunderstorms were scattered
from Florida to Louisiana. A few showers were over Maine, western
Texas and Oregon.
   Blustery northwest winds prevailed across the Northeast.
   Afternoon highs were only in the upper 40s to lower 60s in the
Great Lakes region.
   The nation's high on Tuesday was 114 at Bullhead City and Gila
Bend, both in Arizona.

<HEAD>Supervisors to Appeal Federal Ruling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors
will appeal a federal judge's ruling that it illegally diluted
Hispanic voting strength in drawing district boundaries in 1981.
   The board's conservative majority voted 3-0 Tuesday to continue
the 2-year-old, $3 million court battle. Of the five-member board's
two liberal members, one dissented but left before the vote, and the
other abstained.
   Conservative Pete Schabarum, who is retiring, accused U.S.
District Judge David Kenyon of exerting ``extraordinary personal
bias'' in Monday's ruling.
   Kenyon said the board members conspired to ``protect their
incumbencies and that of their allies'' when they redrew the
county's voting districts in 1981.
   In so doing, Kenyon added, the supervisors violated the 1965
federal Voting Rights Act and the equal protection clause of the
14th Amendment to the Constitution.
   A lawsuit filed in 1988 accused the supervisors of deliberately
spreading the county's Hispanic population across several districts.
The plaintiffs included a Hispanic organization and the U.S. Justice
Department.
   Hispanics make up about 35 percent of the county's 8.7 million
people. No Hispanic has been elected to the board in more than 100
years.
   Kenyon scheduled a conference for Thursday to discuss options,
such as ordering an immediate redrawing of district boundaries.
   Plaintiffs in the lawsuit have said the results of Tuesday's
elections in two districts should be thrown out.

<HEAD>Perpich Gets The `Why Minnesota?' Question Answered By Gorbachev</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE SORAGHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FARMINGTON, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Rudy Perpich had the same question
many others have asked _ why Minnesota?
   But unlike many others, he got to ask Mikhail Gorbachev himself
during the Soviet president's visit on Sunday. The answer: ``Warm
feelings.''
   ``One of the first questions I asked was ... `Why did you pick
Minnesota?''' Perpich told a crowd Tuesday at the family farm
Gorbachev dropped from his itinerary at the last minute.
   ``He said, `I decided to come to Minnesota.' Then he talked about
reasons why he came to Minnesota. He said over the years, in various
conversations and meetings, he's had a warm feeling toward
Minnesota,'' Perpich said.
   The Soviet Union has had had strong business to Minnesota over
the years, buying such things as computers from Control Data Corp.
   Perpich was at the dairy farm owned by Richard and Cecilia Brand
to watch the release of a bald eagle into the wild. It had been
hoped that Gorbachev would release the bird himself to symbolize
U.S.-Soviet friendship.
   The bird had been captured March, suffering from insecticide
poisoning. It had been recovering at the University of Minnesota's
Raptor Center before Brand cradled it in his arms and tossed it to
freedom.
   ``I'm more comfortable with cows,'' quipped Brand, a dairy farmer.
   Perpich said he did not know exactly why the farm visit was
canceled. But he offered lunch at the governor's mansion for the
Brand family and all who helped out with the farm preparations to
make up for the disappointment.
   Mrs. Brand said that would be very nice. Her husband emphasized
that he was not bitter about being skipped.
   ``At least I got some work done,'' he said, referring to the help
he got from the advance team in sprucing up the farm. Brand said he
spent more than $1,000 to make the place look better and hire extra
hands to do chores.
   Asked if the Brands would be reimbursed, the governor said he
would bring it up with the committee that arranged the visit,
adding, ``That's a good point.''

   The dollar was lower against other major foreign
currencies in quiet European trading today.
   Gold prices rose.
   Although the dollar was below its late Tuesday levels, the
currency was rising from lows reached in Asia earlier in the day,
dealers said.
   They said the dollar was getting support from statements of
several U.S. Federal Reserve officials that interest rates weren't
likely to decline soon.
   They said it also was being boosted by the news of further
violent clashes in the Soviet Union's central Asian republic of
Kirghizia and reports of continued demonstrations in China marking
the first anniversary of the military quashing of the student
demonstrations.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.17 yen to a closing 152.60 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 152.65 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.6865 West German marks, down from 1.6910
   _1.4285 Swiss francs, down from 1.4340
   _5.6877 French francs, down from 5.7020
   _1.9000 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9070
   _1,240.50 Italian lire, down from 1,244.25
   _1.1737 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1752
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.6855, compared with
$1.6820 late Tuesday.
   Gold bullion opened in London today at a bid price of $359.25 a
troy ounce, unchanged from late Tuesday. Dealers later fixed a
recommended price of $359.80 a troy ounce.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $359.80, up from $358.60 late
Tuesday.
   Gold in Hong Kong rose $1.55 to close at a bid $361.42.
   Silver was unchanged in London at a bid price of $5.08 a troy
ounce.

   Vandals broke into a high school, painted swastikas
on the walls and left behind blood-soaked human skulls and bones,
police said today.
   The vandalism was discovered Tuesday when students returned after
a three-day holiday weekend to the Bernard-Palissy high school in
Gien, on the Loire River about 75 miles south of Paris.
   The intruders, who apparently climbed in through a window,
painted swastikas and Jewish Stars of David on the ground floor, cut
telephone cords, then went to the second floor and left
blood-covered human bones, including about six skulls, police said.
   Slogans were written on the walls in German.
   Tests were being conducted to determine when the bones were dug
up and where the blood came from.
   There has been a wave of neo-Nazi and anti-Semitic vandalism
across France in the past four weeks, following the discovery May 10
of a macabre desecration at a Jewish cemetery in the southern town
of Carpentras. Thirty-four tombs there were vandalized, and the body
of an elderly man was dug up and impaled on an umbrella handle.

   When Alzheimer's patient Janet Adkins pressed the
button on a suicide machine and chose death over mental
degeneration, she stirred debate over the ethics of euthanasia and
sent prosecutors to the law books.
   The 54-year-old Portland, Ore., woman on Monday became the first
person to die using Dr. Jack Kevorkian's suicide device. After her
husband of 34 years told her once more that he loved her, Mrs.
Adkins had Kevorkian hook her intravenously to the machine inside
his van parked in a suburban park.
   She hit the button, coma-inducing thiopental and a lethal dose of
potassium chloride dripped into her veins, and within six minutes
she was dead.
   She and her husband, Ron, were members of the Hemlock Society,
which supports the option of sucide for the terminally ill.
   But assisting someone's suicide is explicitly illegal in Oregon;
the Adkinses flew to Michigan, where the law is not so clear, after
they read about Kevorkian's device and after experimental
Alzheimer's cures failed.
   ``It's unfortunate that Mrs. Adkins had to go so far to get the
assistance she desired,'' Hemlock Society spokeswoman Diana Smith
said from the group's office in Eugene, Ore.
   ``Since Michigan is the only state in the union that doesn't have
specific laws against people who assist in suicide, Kevorkian used
it as a testing ground,'' Smith said. ``What happened Monday kind of
opens the door for seeing these laws are outdated and need to be
changed.''
   Other vehemently disagreed.
   ``This ghoulish event illustrates the lengths that medicine can
go once doctors violate the Hippocratic Oath and tradition which
separates the killer from the care-giver,'' said Mary Senander,
director of the International Anti-Euthanasia Task Force of
Steubenville, Ohio.
   The American Medical Association considers passive euthanasia
ethical, said lawyer Reinhard Priester of the Center for Biomedical
Ethics at the University of Minnesota. Passive euthanasia might, for
example, involve the withholding of food to a comatose patient
believed to have no chance of recovery, he said.
   But Priester said that Kevorkian, by arranging a suicide with the
patient's consent, appeared to have participated in active
euthanasia _ which the AMA has deemed morally inappropriate.
   ``Clearly, what he provided her is not something that would
relieve her pain and suffering,'' Priester said. ``The clear intent
of providing those two chemicals was to hasten the patient's death.''
   Whether Kevorkian's action is legal in Michigan is what Oakland
County Prosecutor Richard Thompson is now trying to decide.
   He said Tuesday he believes a 1920 Michigan Supreme Court
decision makes abetting a suicide illegal, although he hasn't
decided whether to bring charges.
   In 1920, the court upheld the murder conviction of a man who
placed a bottle of poison within reach of his wife, who wanted to
commit suicide, Thompson said.
   But a 1983 state Court of Appeals decision said a man who gave a
gun to a friend who used it to commit suicide shouldn't have been
charged, he said.
   ``The state Supreme Court refused to hear the 1983 case, saying
that if the 1920 decision were no longer the law of the land, then
it was the high court that should have made the decision. It did
not,'' Thompson said.
   Kevorkian, a longtime advocate of euthanasia, said Tuesday he
expected to be prosecuted. ``What I am doing was ethical even in
Hippocrates' day. I guess highly emotional people would call it
murder,'' he said.

   A woman who refuses to tell a judge the
whereabouts of her two granddaughters has begun serving a sentence
at a missing-children's agency.
   The judge said he hoped 15 hours a week at the agency would
persuade 76-year-old Mary Pigeon to lead authorities to the girls
and their mother, who left their Warwick home five years ago.
   ``I don't know where she is,'' Pigeon said Tuesday after leaving
work at the Society for Young Victims, a small office across from
City Hall with photos of missing children plastered across the
windows. ``I wish I knew.''
   Pigeon has said that all along, but Superior Court Judge Mark
Pfeiffer said he ``absolutely'' has evidence Pigeon knows where her
daughter took the children, and he imposed the sentence Monday in
hopes of forcing her to comply.
   Elaine Yates left home in 1985 with her daughters _ 3{-year-old
Kimberly and 10-month-old Kelly _ after she found her husband in bed
with another woman.
   Russell Yates Jr. was awarded custody of his daughters after his
wife failed to return to contest his request. He then sued his
mother-in-law to compel her to disclose the whereabouts of the
children.
   Last July, Pfeiffer ruled that Pigeon took part in the abduction
and knew where her daughter and grandchildren were. He found her in
contempt.
   The judge said he hoped Pigeon's time at the Newport agency would
show her the anguish parents of missing children endure.
   ``If she sees firsthand working at this center 60 hours a month
the kind of harm this does to families, hopefully within her
conscience she will come forward,'' Pfeiffer said.
   The judge will call Pigeon back into court June 29 to review the
case. Yates' attorney, Neil Philbin, said if she does not cooperate
then, he will push the judge to jail her, as he did this week as
well.

   China announced today it had freed 97 more
participants in last year's democracy movement after the anniversary
of the movement's bloody demise passed with only a few small
protests.
   The releases bring to 881 the number freed in the past six
months, out of thousands arrested. But new arrests have been
reported as recently as last week.
   For the first time, two top student leaders were among those
freed. Xiong Wei and Zhou Fengsuo, both students at Qinghua
University, were on the government's list of 21 most-wanted students
and were arrested last June.
   Zhou was turned in by his sister and Xiong surrendered in his
mother's company, according to official accounts.
   The No. 1 student on the list, Wang Dan, remains in jail. Five
others on the list escaped abroad.
   Of the 97 released, 21 had been jailed in Shanghai, a brief
Xinhua News Agency report said. They included Yao Yongzhan, a Hong
Kong student who was released Tuesday, the Hong Kong government
reported. There was no word on when he would be allowed to return
home.
   Rumors that a release was imminent circulated in Beijing last
week. The government waited until after the anniversary Sunday and
Monday of last year's army attack on student-led protesters in
Beijing, in which hundreds and possibly thousands of people died.
   Soldiers and police patrolled Beijing in force on both days to
head off any commemorative protests, and were largely successful.
   The only major incident, a rally Sunday night by hundreds of
Beijing University students, was confined to the campus. Students on
other campuses expressed their anger by smashing beer bottles, and
several non-students held small protests near Tiananmen Square.
   Xinhua said the 97 were given lenient treatment after having
``voluntarily confessed their wrongdoings and expressed a
willingness to repent.'' None had been charged or tried.
   ``Those who obstinately stick to an incorrect course and refuse
to repent will be punished strictly in accordance with the law,''
Xinhua said.
   The protests last year began as a student movement and escalated
into a massive nationwide outcry against the Communist Party's
heavy-handed ad increasingly corrupt rule.
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping and other aging revolutionaries who
ordered the crackdown maintain that a small group of plotters
orchestrated the protests in an effort to topple the party.
   They have rejected Western descriptions of the jailed protesters
as political prisoners, and sentenced many to long terms. Twenty
people have been executed, according to official reports, and many
more by unofficial accounts.
   The releases did not signify a softening on the part of the
party, but an attempt to put the turmoil behind it, ease deep-seated
domestic anger over the crackdown and restore badly damaged
relations with the West.
   Many of those freed earlier remain under forms of probation, and
many have lost their jobs or been expelled from school _ harsh
punishment in a system where most jobs are assigned.
   China announced in January that it had freed 573 people and in
May that a second group of 211 were released, including several
well-known academics and a famous journalist, Dai Qing.
   It said then that only 431 people were still being held for
investigation. That figure left thousands unaccounted for,
suggesting that it did not include those already sentenced.
   Among the most prominent people still jailed are Chen Zimin, the
head of a non-government social research institute that has since
been closed down; Liu Xiaobo, 34, a college lecturer; and Bao
Zunxin, a fellow at the Institute of History of the Chinese Academy
of Social Sciences.
   Six students on the most-wanted list are known to be still
jailed. Five escaped abroad, and the whereabouts of eight are not
known.

<HEAD>Fighting Continues in Cambodia Despite Tokyo Peace Conference</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Forces loyal to Prince Nordom Sihanouk
were engaged in heavy combat inside Cambodia today, despite
Sihanouk's pledge a day earlier that his guerrillas no longer would
fight in the 11-year-old conflict.
   Rocket and artillery fire could be heard from this Thai border
province as Sihanouk forces engaged those of the Hun Sen government
in Cambodia.
   ``There is heavy fighting now,'' said Roland Eng, spokesman for
Sihanouk's guerrilla faction. ``Nothing will change for now. In
Tokyo there was only an agreement, not implementation of a
cease-fire. The fighting will continue.''
   Sihanouk and Premier Hun Sen signed a communique in Tokyo on
Tuesday that said Cambodia's warring factions ``should refrain from
all offensive actions'' and that there should be measures to ensure
a ``military standstill.''
   Although the vaguely worded communique fell short of being a
cease-fire agreement, Sihanouk told a news conference that his own
forces and those of his non-Communist ally, the Khmer People's
National Liberation Front, would not take part in fighting inside
Cambodia.
   Sihanouk said the war would continue between Hun Sen forces and
the thrid faction of his resistance coalition, the Communist Khmer
Rouge, which boycotted the Tokyo conference sessions and did not
sign the communique.
   In Tokyo, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama said Japan
still hopes the Khmer Rouge will join the agreement. He said Japan
will ask for Chinese and Thai help to bring the radical faction into
a cease-fire, news reports said.
   China is the main backer of the Khmer Rouge.
   ``The way is always open (for the Khmer Rouge) to join the joint
agreement,'' Kyodo News Service quoted Nakayama as saying today.
   In Bangkok, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Rogachev said he
hoped further Cambodian peace talks expected to be held in Paris
this summer could result in a freezing of arms supplies to all sides
in the conflict.
   Eng said no orders had been received from Sihanouk in Tokyo to
halt battlefield activity. He said it was his understanding that the
Tokyo communique would not actually go into effect until a later
date.
   Guerrilla sources said Cambodian government troops were trying to
push back a 2,000-man guerrilla offensive that seized much of a
strategic highway in Bantey Meanchey province in northwestern
Cambodia.
   In recent days, press releases from Sihanouk's group in Thailand
have claimed major victories in that province and other areas of
Cambodia. One release said that on Tuesday, two of Sihanouk's units
staged raids on Samrong, the capital of Bantey Meanchey.
   In addition, Western diplomats and Thai intelligence sources have
confirmed some Khmer Rouge claims of major victories inside Cambodia
in recent days.

<TEXT>
   President Hashemi Rafsanjani said today that
Washington must pressure Israel and Kuwait to free Moslem prisoners
if it wants help in gaining the release of the 16 Westerners held by
kidnappers in Lebanon.
   ``The irresponsible, arrogant attitude of the United States has
created further difficulties'' in resolving the hostage crisis, the
turbaned Rafsanjani told a news conference for 200 foreign and local
journalists.
   Iran's leaders and Shiite leaders in Lebanon have often demanded
that the United States urge Israel to release 350 Moslem prisoners
held in Israel and in Israel's self-declared security zone in
southern Lebanon.
   However, it was the first time in some months that an Iranian
leader referred to 15 Shiite Moslems jailed in Kuwait in 1984 for
car bombings in that country that killed five people and wounded 86.
   Two American educators, Robert Polhill and Frank Reed, were
released by their pro-Iranian kidnappers at Tehran's bidding in
April, and Iran said Washington should make a gesture in return.
   ``An appropriate response was expected after the Lebanese
unconditionally set free the hostages _ release of hostages in
Kuwait and Israel,'' Rafsanjani said without elaborating.
   ``Why don't you help increase the necessary public pressure on
those governments to release these hostages, so that the Western
hostages can be freed in return?'' the Iranian president asked the
journalists.
   ``If the United States is serious about wanting relations with
Iran in the future, it must begin to act, because talking is not
enough,'' he added.
   Polhill and Reed were the first U.S. captives to be released in
3{ years. Six Americans are among the 16 Westerners still held by
pro-Iranian kidnappers in Lebanon. The longest-held is Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for the Associated Press,
who was abducted in March 1985.
   Rafsanjani also said he did not rule out a peace summit with
President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. But he said that will happen only
after lower-level Iraqi-Iranian meetings are held to discuss
reaching a permanent settlement to the Persian Gulf war, which ended
in a cease-fire in August 1988.
   Referring to Iran's death threats against British author Salman
Rushdie, he said ties with London could be resumed if Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher condemns his book ``The Satanic Verses.'' But he
said there was no question of lifting the death decree on Rushdie,
whose book Iran says defames Islam.
   Rafsanjani said Iran's policy was ``to help secure the release of
all the hostages, whether they be Western, Lebanese or Iranian.''
   The Iranian president reiterated his country's claim that four
Iranians _ two diplomats, a journalist and a driver _ who were
kidnapped by the Christian Lebanese Forces militia in 1982 are still
alive.
   ``We have learned officially from a government, and from reliable
sources in east Beirut, that the Iranian hostages are alive,''
Rafsanjani said. ``The special envoy of a certain government has
informed us.''
   He did not identify the country.
   The Bush administration recently provided Iran with information
through the Swiss government which it said indicated the four men
had been killed.
   Sources in the Lebanese Forces have said the Iranians were killed
soon after they were seized. Rafsanjani has said repeatedly that if
the West wants help in releasing hostages, it must help determine
the fate of the four.

<HEAD>Kayaker Missing After Paddling Over Niagara Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NIAGARA FALLS, Ontario (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who paddled a kayak over
Niagara Falls in a stunt was still missing this morning and parks
police resumed their search.
   The red kayak of Jessie W. Sharp, 28, of Ocoee, Tenn., was
recovered Tuesday afternoon below Horseshoe Falls on the Canadian
side. The kayak was ``all in one piece ... in fairly good condition,
all things considered,'' said Maureen Quinn, a constable with the
Niagara Parks Police.
   ``Our regular patrol is watching the river,'' Sgt. Jim Dugos said
this morning. He said police can't dive there to look for a body.
   Asked if the man were presumed dead, he said: ``You never know.
Sometimes these people turn up.''
   Ken Kitchen was working in a tower overlooking the Niagara river
when he saw Sharp in his kayak. Trying to stop him, the utility
closed the dam gates, reducing the water flow to the falls, Kitchen
said.
   The man's boat grounded, but he picked it up and moved it into
the middle of the water.
   ``We did what we could to try and stop him, but there wasn't much
time,'' Kitchen said. ``He was gone before our help could get there.
All we could do was sit and watch helplessly.''
   The Canadian falls are 181 feet high, or about as tall as a
13-story building.
   Sharp, who was last seen at about 1:45 p.m., was trying to
complete a stunt that had been planned for about 10 years, said
constable Kim Davis. Police said nobody before had ever tried to
kayak over the falls.
   ``Barrels, yes,'' Quinn said of other attempts to go safely over
the falls in enclosed capsules. But, she said, ``it doesn't seem
plausible he could do it (and survive).''
   Since 1901, at least 10 people have gone over the falls in
barrels or rubber balls; seven have survived.

<HEAD>Retired Police Officer Killed, Wife Injured in Belfast Car Bomb</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bomb exploded in the car of a
retired police officer today as he drove near a primary school,
killing the man and seriously injuring his wife, police said.
   Two other people walking along the road where the blast occurred
in north Belfast were slightly injured, said a police spokesman,
speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom.
   No organization claimed responsibility, but police said it bears
similarities to previous bombings by the Irish Republican Army, the
mainly Roman Catholic group fighting to end British rule of
Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland.
   The bombing came two days after Protestant gunmen killed a Roman
Catholic man, which followed the IRA killings of two British
soldiers since Friday. A Roman Catholic priest today urged against a
spiral of retaliation.
   Rescue workers cut the elderly couple from their wrecked car, but
the man died later in hospital, police said.
   Their names were not released, but officials said the man was a
65-year-old retired member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary Reserve
Force, police said.
   His wife, also in her 60s, was in critical condition in an
intensive care unit, said a Mater Hospital spokesman.
   A passenger in a taxi driving behind the car said: ``The bomb
seemed to go off under the driver's seat. The driver seemed to be in
a bad way. It was a horrible sight.''
   In Annaghmore, County Armagh, a Catholic priest told mourners at
the funeral of the Catholic man killed on Monday that the burial
should be a starting point for building a new, peaceful way of life.
   ``Forget about retaliation because retaliation brings nothing,
only violence and more violence,'' said the Rev. Seamus McGinley.
   Patrick Boyle, 60, was gunned down at his home near Portdadown,
25 miles southwest of Belfast, on Monday. The Ulster Volunteer
Force, an illegal Protestant organization, claimed responsibility
for the killing.
   Boyle's two sons were also shot and wounded.
   The IRA wants to unite Northern Ireland, a British province with
the 95 percent Catholic Republic of Ireland.

<TEXT>
   Gov. James Blanchard has made it
official _ he'll run for a third four-year term.
   Blanchard returned to his hometown Tuesday to make the
announcement. He told a crowd of about 150 supporters that Michigan
has turned itself around during his eight years in office, but
there's much yet to be done.
   ``The fight for Michigan's future is not finished. Any politician
can make promises. I offer something different _ not promises, but
real solutions,'' Blanchard said in an apparent swipe at the
all-but-certain Republican nominee, state Senate Majority Leader
John Engler.
   Engler, who declared his candidacy in February, has hit hard at
Blanchard. He claims the Democratic governor overstates Michigan's
progress and that it is time for a new leader.
   Blanchard first was elected governor in 1982 after serving eight
years in the U.S. House.
   John Lauve, a Grosse Pointe engineer, has also filed for the
Republican nomination. No other Democrats filed for the Aug. 7
primary.

<HEAD>Government Proposes Bill To Ban Tobacco Advertising</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today proposed legislation that would
give France one of the world's toughest anti-smoking laws and impose
a total ban on tobacco ads in 1993.
   The bill approved today by the Cabinet also would severely
restrict advertising for alcoholic beverages. Ads for hard liquor
would be allowed only in publications geared specifically toward
adults and must carry a message about the health hazards of drinking.
   Under the law, expected to win easy approval in the National
Assembly, cigarette packs will have to carry a health warning and
smoking will be banned in a wide range of public places.
   A separate bill is expected to be introduced soon that would
raise cigarette prices by 15 percent _ the biggest single increase
ever in France. The government sets cigarette prices.
   ``100,000 people die prematurely in France each year because of
tobacco and excess alcohol consumption,'' said Cabinet spokesman
Louis Le Pensac. ``This is an intolerable human, social and economic
cost.''
   Under the legislation, submitted by Health Minister Claude Evin,
all direct and indirect tobacco advertising will be banned as of
Jan. 1, 1993, including the sponsorship of sports and cultural
events by tobacco companies.
   Even the use of cigarette trademarks as logos on non-tobacco
items _ such as clothing or luggage _ will be banned, Le Pensac said.
   Cigarette manufacturers have contended that a ban on tobacco
advertising would not affect consumption, but they estimate the
proposed price increase will lower sales by 10 percent.
   Ironically, the government is a major producer of cigarettes. The
government's wholly owned tobacco company produces such brands as
Gauloises and Gitanes and controls about 51 percent of the cigarette
market.

<HEAD>NBC Affiliates March on Capitol Hill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC affiliate executives wrap up their
first-ever convention today, but Capitol Hill likely will be hearing
from them again.
   The executives will be doing follow-ups to their mass visit
Tuesday with their congressmen and senators on broadcasting issues,
said Cyril Vetter, a spokesman for the group.
   About 300 of them went to Capitol Hill, some for the first time,
seeking help for their stations and NBC in competing with cable and
Hollywood studios.
   The trip was made ``because we wanted to be more of a part of the
legislative process than we have in the past,'' said Vetter, a Baton
Rouge, La., broadcaster who heads NBC's affiliate government affairs
board.
   The march on Congress had two basic goals, said Vetter.
   One was to urge support for a possible change in Federal
Communications Commission rules barring networks from the lucrative
program syndication market and from a financial interest in shows
others produce.
   The FCC may begin reconsideration of those rules on June 14
unless the networks can work out a compromise on them with Hollywood
studios and producers.
   NBC station executives also sought help from Congress in
resolving a problem bothering many stations _ the transmission of
their broadcast signals by cable systems that aren't now required by
law to pay for the signals.
   ``This is the beginning of the process of getting our oar in the
water,'' said Pep Cooney, president of KPNX-TV in Phoenix.
   He spoke after leading a delegation of Arizona and New Mexico
station officials to the office of Sen. Dennis DeContini, D-Ariz.
   The scene there was similar to 26 other regional gatherings on
Capitol Hill, where congressmen and senators were shown an
eight-minute videotape outlining the affiliates' problems.
   The tape portrayed the networks as unfairly bound by rules that
don't apply to the major studios and a strong cable industry that is
steadily taking viewers away from the networks and their local
stations.
   Cooney described the visits as ``educational.'' He said the
affiliates weren't seeking legislation, but were trying to get
Congress ``to join the process of making a level playing field''
that would equalize the competition between the networks and their
rivals.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration, seeking to quiet the
clamor over government funding of allegedly obscene art, will seek a
one-year interim budget for the National Endowment for the Arts
instead of five years, a White House spokeswoman said today.
   Deputy press secretary Alixe Glen called it ``the prudent thing
to do.''
   It will allow an independent commission time to review the arts
agency's grant-making procedures, she said.
   The White House had been seeking a five-year budget
reauthorization for the arts agency with no restrictions on its
grant-making procedures.
   But conservatives on Capitol Hill have sought to write new
restrictions into law to prevent the agency from patronizing what
they view as obscene or blasphemous art, such as exhibits of the
late Robert Mapplethorpe's homoerotic photographs or Andres
Serrano's shot of a crucifix in urine.
   President Bush has said previously he opposed legal restrictions
on the NEA's grant-making authority, but preferred to rely on the
good judgment of NEA Chairman John Frohnmayer.
   A 12-member advisory commission was meeting today for the first
time to review the agency's grant-making procedures.
   ``By calling for a one-year reauthorization, we are basically
doing the prudent thing,'' said Ms. Glen.
   She said that this approach is intended to ensure that the arts
endowment does not run out of funds over the next year, and it
``provides the independent arts commission time to do its study and
report back to the president.''
   ``Given the political climate, this isn't something we want to do
hastily,'' she said.
   ``Our position remains that we would like to see a five-year,
clean reauthorization with no restrictions,'' she said, but that did
not appear possible now.
   The one-year plan was decided upon at a meeting Tuesday including
White House officials and Frohnmayer, who told The Washington Post
it affords a chance to come up with ``a reasonable solution, rather
than a hysterical response.''
   The endowment has been embroiled in debate over federal funding
of the arts and freedom of expression since June 1989 because of
grants awarded for an exhibit of Mapplethorpe photographs that some
considered obscene.
   Congress affixed restrictions on ``obscene'' art to the NEA's
fiscal 1990 appropriation, drawing protests over the
constitutionality of the language.

<TEXT>
   California voters approved the state's largest
tax increase ever in doubling gas taxes to pay for an $18.5 billion
freeway construction program.
   Proposition 111, a symbolic end to the tax revolt that began with
passage of Proposition 13 in 1978, was approved Tuesday along with a
companion measure to provide $1 billion in bond funding for commuter
trains.
   California voters also rejected two redistricting measures that
would have helped Republicans. An ethics-in-government proposition
won by a wide margin. And a prosecutor-sponsored initiative to
shorten trials, narrow defendants' rights and expand the death
penalty, was approved.
   In local elections, San Francisco voters approved a record $332
million bond issue to help pay for repairs from last October's
earthquake. Voters in two San Francisco Bay area counties _ Alameda
and Marin _ voted down measures to create or strengthen ``nuclear
free zones.''
   Known for its sun, surf and celebrities, Malibu added cityhood to
its string of alliterative claims to fame. Residents of the fabled
seaside community voted to break free from Los Angeles County's
direct rule by incorporating as a city in a lopsided vote, 3,797 to
708.
   The chic neighborhood's residents include such high-profile
personalities as Johnny Carson, Michael Landon, Martin Sheen,
Shirley MacLaine and Olivia Newton John.
   But the stars, for the most part, sat the election out,
preferring to let the beach community residents decide their own
fate without celebrity influence playing an undue role.
   With 91 percent of precincts reporting, Proposition 111, the
highway and rail building proposal that raises gasoline taxes from 9
to 18 cents and championed by Gov. George Deukmejian and a coalition
of business and labor, gained approval, 53 percent to 47 percent.
   The measure proved most popular in the freeway-laced urban
regions. Rural voters showed they solidly disliked the measure.
   Proposition 111's companion measure, Proposition 108, won
approval, 56 percent to 44 percent.
   Voters also approved Proposition 116, a $1.99 billion bond levy
for mass-transit rail building, by 53 percent to 47 percent.
   Voters rebuffed GOP leaders by a roughly 2-1 margin two measures
they hoped would reign in the Democrats' ability to use
redistricting to maintain or increase their strength in the
Legislature and Congress.
   ``It's sad for California. This wasn't a Republican Party
measure; this was a people measure,'' said state Republican Chairman
Frank Visco.
   Republicans called the measures long-overdue reforms to an unjust
system. Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and other Democrats labeled
the initiatives GOP power plays.
   An ethics proposition won a clear-cut victory, 63 percent to 37
percent.
   Lawmakers put Proposition 112 on the ballot last September to
help restore public confidence in the Legislature in the wake of an
FBI corruption probe that resulted in the conviction of one state
senator and the indictment of a state tax board member who is a
former lawmaker.
   ``This is outstanding news. The voters are going to get control
of their government again,'' said Jim Wheaton, executive director of
California Common Cause.
   The measure prohibits legislators and other state elected
officials from receiving speaking fees, requires the Legislature to
pass laws banning or strictly limiting gifts to elected state
officials, calls for tougher conflict-of-interest penalties for
legislators, and directs the Legislature to prohibit legislators and
state officials from lobbying for a year after leaving office.
   California prosecutors scored a political victory by getting
voters to approve their Speedy Trial Initiative, Proposition 115, by
57 to 43 percent.
   The measure repeals independent state constitutional rights for
criminal defendants; shortens court proceedings, particularly
preliminary hearings and questioning of prospective jurors; allows
16-year-old killers to be sentenced to life without parole, and
expands the state's death penalty law for the first time since 1978.
   Backers called on the voters to finish the job that started with
the 1986 removal of Chief Justice Rose Bird and two state Supreme
Court colleagues, the first California justices defeated in 50
years. Many provisions of the initiative overturn rulings of the
liberal Bird court.
   Opponents predicted rushing criminal cases to trial will push
civil suits aside and that the changes will cause chaos and
constitutional challenges.

   Mayor Lionel Wilson lost his bid for a
fourth term, apparently the victim of a botched attempt to return
the Raiders football team to their birthplace in Oakland.
   None of his seven rivals in the non-partisan election won a
majority, forcing a runoff in November between the two top
vote-getters, state Assemblyman Elihu Harris and city Councilman
Wilson Riles Jr.
   Wilson, the underdog going into the election, came in third.
   Harris had 32,830 votes, or 46 percent, Riles had 17,607 votes or
25 percent, and Wilson had 12,232 votes, or 17 percent.
   As the early returns came in, Wilson had said he was confident he
would face Harris in arunoff but was prepared for disappointment.
   ``When I get into any game, I get into it to win, but I also
understand the realities of politics,'' he said.
   The Raiders' move to Los Angeles in 1982 dealt a crushing blow to
Oakland's pride, but many residents opposed expensive proposals this
year to lure them back.
   Wilson, 75, a former judge who has been mayor for 16 years, had
initially backed a proposal that offered Raiders owner Al Davis $602
million, including guaranteed ticket income and up-front payments.
Critics charged the city and Alameda County would have to pay
millions if Raiders games didn't sell out.
   In April, after 15 months of negotiations with the team, Wilson
and the City Council withdrew the proposal, prompted by a petition
drive that gathered 30,000 signatures to put the deal on the city
ballot.
   A recent joint poll by the Tribune and the Gallup Organization
showed that 63 percent of voters don't think a deal to bring the
Raiders home to Oakland is important.

<TEXT>
   On the anniversary of D-Day, the son
of Dwight D. Eisenhower planted an oak sapling today at the
beachside cemetery where 9,800 of the U.S. invasion troops commanded
by his father are buried.
   Scores of Americans and Britons, some of them D-Day veterans,
followed John Eisenhower and other dignitaries through wind and rain
for a series of ceremonies marking the 46th anniversary of the
Normandy invasion.
   This year, the commemorations featured remembrances of General
Eisenhower, the supreme commander of Allied forces during World War
II, because 1990 is the centennial of his birth.
   Many of those at the ceremonies wore ``I Like Ike'' buttons on
their jackets.
   The Eisenhower entourage began the day in the medieval town of
Bayeux, which miraculously escaped major damage during the Battle of
Normandy, then flew by helicopter to the U.S. cemetery on a bluff
overlooking Omaha Beach, site of the heaviest fighting with Nazi
German forces on D-Day.
   Later, the group was to visit the second American landing site _
Utah Beach _ and also inaugurate an Eisenhower memorial at
Tournieres, where the general set up his headquarters after the
invasion.
   Among those in the entourage were France's tourism minister,
Olivier Stirn, and the U.S. ambassador to France, Walter Curley.
   The D-Day observances began Monday in Britain with the unveiling
of a plaque at Norfolk House, Eisenhower's pre-invasion
headquarters. Among those at the ceremony was NATO commander Gen.
John R. Galvin, whose job was first held by Eisenhower.
   Galvin said Eisenhower faced difficult decisions at Norfolk House
_ the last being the decision to strike during a short break in the
weather on June 6, 1944.
   ``Ike is remembered after that for the great smile, for the great
symbol of confidence that he was,'' said Galvin.
   ``But this was before the smile really became famous. As the
statue here in Grosvenor Square shows, there was a grim
determination involved too. For me, these days here at Norfolk
House, were the hardest days of all.''

<HEAD>Census Raising Pay to Hire More Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Census workers are getting a raise, some of
them at least.
   Pay rates will increase between 50 cents and $2 an hour in
selected locations across the country where the bureau has had
problems attracting staff.
   Currently workers are paid between $5 and $8 an hour depending on
local wage rates and staff needs.
   While the bureau has sufficient job applicants nationally,
shortages exist in localities where few people are out of work and
available for such temporary employment.
   In those areas, the higher pay is aimed both at recruiting more
employees and keeping those already on the job, officials said.
   The door-to-door census count is scheduled to continue at least
through June 30 and some local follow-up and processing will
continue through the end of summer.
   Among the areas where the higher pay rates will be offered are
the New York, Boston, Atlanta, the Washington, D.C., suburbs, Kansas
City, Charlotte, N.C., Arizona, San Diego, Los Angeles and San
Francisco.
   The census, mandated every 10 years by the Constitution, is used
to redistribute seats in the House of Representatives and to divide
up billions of dollars in federal aid among the state and
communities.

   A man who paddled a kayak over
Niagara Falls in a stunt was still missing this morning and parks
police resumed their search.
   The red kayak of Jessie W. Sharp, 28, of Ocoee, Tenn., was
recovered Tuesday afternoon below Horseshoe Falls on the Canadian
side. The kayak was ``all in one piece ... in fairly good condition,
all things considered,'' said Maureen Quinn, a constable with the
Niagara Parks Police.
   ``Our regular patrol is watching the river,'' Sgt. Jim Dugos said
this morning. He said police can't dive there to look for a body.
   Asked if the man were presumed dead, he said: ``You never know.
Sometimes these people turn up.''
   Ken Kitchen was working in a tower overlooking the Niagara river
when he saw Sharp in his kayak. Trying to stop him, the utility
closed the dam gates, reducing the water flow to the falls, Kitchen
said.
   The man's boat grounded, but he picked it up and moved it into
the middle of the water.
   ``We did what we could to try and stop him, but there wasn't much
time,'' Kitchen said. ``He was gone before our help could get there.
All we could do was sit and watch helplessly.''
   The Canadian falls are 181 feet high, or about as tall as a
13-story building.
   Sharp, who was last seen at about 1:45 p.m., was trying to
complete a stunt that had been planned for about 10 years, said
constable Kim Davis. Police said nobody before had ever tried to
kayak over the falls.
   ``Barrels, yes,'' Quinn said of other attempts to go safely over
the falls in enclosed capsules. But, she said, ``it doesn't seem
plausible he could do it (and survive).''
   Since 1901, at least 12 people have gone over the falls in
barrels or rubber balls; nine have survived.
   ``It's beyond me why anyone would attempt this,'' said George
Bailey of the Niagara Parks Commission. ``He obviously doesn't know
our falls.''
   Bailey said the man was accompanied by a film crew and a friend
who took photographs.
   ``He had all the confidence in the world, according to his
friend,'' Bailey said.
   During a press conference Tuesday, police showed a videotape of
the kayaker shot by a tourist. The tape shows a man in a boat
emblazoned with ``Rapidman'' on one side successfully negotiating
the rapids of the Niagara River just before the falls. Then, he
disappears.

   Harvey Gantt, a former Charlotte mayor
accustomed to breaking racial barriers, proclaimed ``a new day in
North Carolina'' after he won the Democratic nomination to challenge
Jesse Helms for the U.S. Senate.
   ``I want to tell you that God is good, yes he is,'' Gantt told
supporters Tuesday after he beat Brunswick County District Attorney
Mike Easley 57 percent to 43 percent in a runoff.
   The victory for Gantt, who is black, broke a string of defeats in
which minority candidates in North Carolina have led primaries with
several white candidates, then lost runoffs with a single white
candidate.
   With all returns in, Gantt had 273,347 votes, or 57 percent, to
Easley's 207,329, or 43 percent. The figures indicated about a
quarter of the state's more than 2 million registered Democrats
voted.
   Gantt led the May 8 primary over Easley in a six-way race, but
failed to capture the 40 percent necessary to keep Easley from
calling for a runoff. The state election law had just been changed
to lower the threshold from 50 percent, a provision that had stymied
black aspirations for statewide office.
   Gantt, the first black to win the nomination for U.S. Senate in
North Carolina this century, was the first black to attend Clemson
University in South Carolina.
   He served two terms as the first black mayor of North Carolina's
largest city, which is 75 percent white and usually votes Republican.
   A 47-year old architect with a master's degree from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Gantt said his background
growing up in poverty in Charleston, S.C., led him to run for the
Senate.
   ``One of the reasons I want to do this is because America has
been good to me,'' he said. ``I'm someone who came from humble
circumstances and I cannot say I live in humble circumstances now.
That is what promise did for me, this belief, this hard work, this
effort. I don't want to see that snuffed out for a lot of other
people.''
   Gantt on Tuesday night emphasized his support for abortion
rights, an issue on which he and Helms are opposed.
   ``It's not the business of government to interfere with a woman's
right to choose,'' Gantt said, drawing a loud cheer from the crowd.
   Easley, who left his own supporters to visit Gantt's victory
celebration, said Democrats needed a candidate who can appeal to
urban, rural and suburban voters.
   ``We have found him. He has my full support,'' Easley said.
``I'll campaign hard for him _ Harvey Gantt.''
   Helms issued congratulations ``on a hard-earned victory,'' and
said in a statement, ``I congratulate Mike Easley on a hard-fought
race.''
   Thad Beyle, a political science professor at the University of
North Carolina, said it was crucial for Gantt to keep control of the
agenda in his race against the three-term incumbent.
   ``He has to deflect, divert and de-everything else the tradition
of Helms setting the agenda and then making people measure up to
that agenda,'' Beyle said.
   Helms already has amassed more than $5.3 million for the Senate
campaign. Beyle said Gantt could face a more difficult time than
former Gov. Jim Hunt, who was defeated by Helms in 1984, in raising
money.
   ``But he'll get a lot of the ABH _ Anybody But Helms _ money out
there,'' Beyle said.
   Gannt said he wants to campaign on problems that affect working
people _ health care, public education and the environment. He said
his campaign will be about vision, not color. ``In Jesse's vision of
America,'' Gantt said while campaigning, ``I wouldn't even have been
allowed to vote.''
   The primary victory was a comeback for Gantt, who lost his
mayoral re-election campaign in 1987 to Republican Sue Myrick by
less than 1,000 votes.
   ``That was the worst moment I've had in politics,'' he said. ``We
lost the race because we didn't put enough effort forward.''
   Gantt and his wife, Cindy, have been married for 25 years. Their
oldest daughter, Sonja, 24, is a television journalist in Charlotte.
Erika, 19, is a student at the University of North Carolina, and
Angela, 17, and Adam 14, attend public school in Charlotte. Gantt
sings baritone in his Baptist church choir.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Say Poindexter Should Be Imprisoned</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former national security adviser John M.
Poindexter should be imprisoned for feeding Congress a ``diet of
lies'' about the Iran-Contra affair, prosecutors said today.
   Poindexter ``did violence to this nation's fundamental principles
of government'' by trying to cover up details of U.S.-Iran arms
sales and covert aid to the Nicaraguan rebels, the prosecutors said
in a sentencing memo made public today.
   ``That system relies fundamentally upon the exchange of truthful
information,'' the memo said. ``If, as occurred in this case,
high-ranking officials of one branch of government feel free to feed
the other branch a diet of lies, then the constitutional system will
surely sicken and eventually die,'' said the memo by independent
counsel Lawrence E. Walsh.
   Poindexter, who served as President Reagan's national security
adviser from late 1985 until his resignation when the Iran-Contra
affair was exposed in November 1986, is scheduled to be sentenced
Monday for lying to Congress and destroying documents.
   He could receive up to 25 years imprisonment and fined as much as
$1.25 million for five felony convictions of conspiracy, making
false statements and obstruction.
   Walsh's office said Poindexter should be given ``a period of
incarceration'' because ``his crimes severely threaten the integrity
of our system of government'' and ``to warn other high-ranking
public officials that criminal violations of the public trust will
result in more than mere loss of public employment.''
   The sentencing memo was made public as one of Poindexter's former
aides, retired Marine Lt. Col. Oliver L. North, continued testifying
before a newly empaneled federal grand jury that is continuing to
investigate the Iran-Contra affair.
   It is trying o determine if other Reagan administration officials
participated in efforts to conceal from Congress the covert arms
supply network North operated to assist the Nicaraguan Contras when
U.S. military aid was cut off.
   North, a former National Security Council staff aide, is
appealing his conviction on related Iran-Contra crimes. North was
placed on probation and ordered to perform community service.
   In its sentencing memo, the prosecution urged U.S. District Judge
Harold H. Greene to disregard arguments that Poindexter deserves
leniency because neither North nor former national security adviser
Robert McFarlane were given prison terms for their Iran-Contra
convictions.
   ``There can be no serious argument... that the defendant is
entitled to leniency because he was a mere subordinate,'' the
prosecution said in contrasting Poindexter with North. Poindexter
``occupied a position where his judgment was critical and in many
instances _ if former President Reagan's deposition testimony is any
guide _ final,'' it said.
   Unlike McFarlane, who pleaded guilty to four misdemeanor charges
of withholding information from Congress, Poindexter did not
cooperate with prosecutors or accept his guilt.

   More violence broke out today in a republic of
Soviet Central Asia, where a land dispute between ethnic groups has
left 40 people dead and more than 200 injured in the past three
days, an official said.
   Anatoly Lukyanov, chairman of the Supreme Soviet legislature,
gave the figures in a report to lawmakers on the latest outbreak of
ethnic fighting to confront the government of President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   Lukyanov did not give a breakdown of the deaths by ethnic groups
in the republic of Kirghizia, where fighting began Monday between
Kirghiz and Uzbeks. The Tass news agency has said only 32 people
have died in the clashes and 200 were injured. No breakdown was
given in its report either.
   Police fired on members of both ethnic groups who tried to storm
police stations in the city of Osh, in the densely populated western
part of the republic, near its border with Uzbekistan, the Tass news
agency said today.
   ``The difficult process of regulating the conflict is going on,''
Lukyanov told lawmakers. He asked deputies from the two republics to
appeal for calm.
   The violence continued for a third day today, and the casualties
included 21 members of law enforcement agencies, Lukyanov said. He
did not give any further details or say how many of the 21 had been
killed and how many injured.
   He said Osh itself was calm, but that the violence had moved to
three other nearby areas outside the city.
   Ethnic Uzbeks from the Fergana Valley of Uzbekistan arrived in
the area to help their comrades fight, Lukyanov said, adding the
Soviet Defense Ministry dispatched reinforcements from the republic
of Turkmenia to the Osh area.
   The clashes spread to the nearby town of Uzgen, where six of the
deaths and 18 injuries were reported. Police in Frunze, the capital
of Kirghizia, were placed on alert.
   A duty officer of the Osh police said most shops and factories
reopened today after being shut down on Tuesday. The officer, who
spoke in a telephone intervew, refused to give his name.
   Tass reported that helicopters hovered over Osh and armored
personnel carriers rolled through the streets in the city of 210,000
people.
   Armed Kirghiz and Uzbeks tried to attack regional civil defense
headquarters and police stations in three districts of the city on
Tuesday, forcing police to open fire, Interfax said.
   A state of emergency and a 10 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew remained in
effect after the rioting began late Monday in a dispute between the
two Sunni Moslem ethnic groups over plots of land for housing.
   Hundreds rampaged through the streets of Osh, setting fire to at
least 10 houses, as well as several shops and cars.
   Tass reported that police and Interior Ministry troops set up
roadblocks and restricted entry to the city. The Soviet army
newspaper Red Star reported the only enterprise that had opened
Tuesday in Osh was a large bakery.
   In Uzgen, 35 miles from Osh, the deaths and injuries occurred
when the district police headquarters was attacked, the newspaper
said. Two submachine guns were confiscated.
   Ethnic tensions spread to Frunze, where police were put on alert
and a soccer match by a visiting team from Uzbekistan was canceled
for fear of violence, according to the newspaper Komsomolskaya
Pravda.
   Lukyanov said youths studying in Frunze had tried to rally in the
streets of the capital but had been persuaded to give up the idea.
He did not specify their nationality or their goal.
   Absamat Masaliyev, head of Kirghizia's Parliament, said in an
address broadcast late Tuesday that authorities were trying to
resolve the land dispute, Tass said.
   Housing is critically short in Soviet Central Asia, among the
poorest regions of the nation.
   Lukyanov said the violence was triggered by a dispute over the
ownership of 79 acres of uncultivated land.
   But Baktiyor Hamidov, head of the economic department of
Uzbekistan's mission in Moscow, said in an interview that there is
much more land at issue. He said 618,000 acres of cotton fields near
the border is being made available by the Uzbek government and local
Kirghiz authorities are controlling it.
   ``They began dividing it between the families'' of mostly Kirghiz
descent, he said, and the Uzbeks demanded it be divided evenly.
   Hamidov said the region was among the nation's most densely
populated, with 500 to 1,125 people per square mile. He said
disputes over land date back to 1924, when traditional boundaries
were blurred by Stalin.
   Leaders of Uzbek groups also demanded that an autonomous region
be set up inside Kirghizia, but negotiations on this subject
produced no results, Tass reported without elaboration. About
one-third of Osh's residents are Uzbek.

   President Bush today formally named Oklahoma
Gov. Henry Bellmon to head his delegation to observe Sunday's
elections in Bulgaria, where the United States has already expressed
concern about intimidation by the former Communist Party.
   The U.S. ambassador to Bulgaria, Sol Polansky, was also named to
the delegation, along with: former U.S. ambassador to Bulgaria Jack
Perry, now a political science professor at Davidson College in
North Carolina; Richard D. McLellan, a lawyer from Michigan;
Marshall L. Miller, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., and Eunice B.
Whittlesey, a Republican National Committeewoman from New York.
   Polansky flew to Copenhagen, Sweden, Tuesday to brief Secretary
of State James Baker III on the latest developments in the election
campaign. The State Department has charged the Bulgarian Socialist
Party, formerly the communists, with engaging in a pattern of
campaign irregularities.
   Last week it deplored violence in the build-up to what will be
the first multiparty elections in Bulgaria since World War II. An
army officer allegedly shot an election canvasser for the opposition
party to death in the town of Shumen, and there have been other
reported acts of violence.
   The State Department also expressed concern over anonymous
threats to opposition candidates and supporters and criticized a
shortage of newsprint for opposition party newspapers.
   Bellmon will be joined by his wife, Shirley, on the June 7-12
mission, which the governor announced Tuesday at a news conference
in Oklahoma.

   A hydrogen leak that postponed
Columbia's astronomy mission reappeared during a test today, and
NASA officials were analyzing the data to pinpoint the source of the
escaping fuel.
   Officials hoped to know by late Thursday how to repair the leak
and reschedule Columbia's mission, said George Diller, spokesman for
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   ``It seems to be a given now that any time we go into filling the
tank with hydrogen ... that the leak will reappear when we reach a
certain temperature, which is approximately minus 420 degrees,''
said Diller.
   ``The theory was that the leak would only manifest itself in the
super-cold conditions of liquid hydrogen and that has been the
case,'' he said.
   About one-sixth of Columbia's external tank was filled with
liquid hydrogen. Traces of the fuel were detected in the aft engine
compartment.
   The leak appears to be in or near a tight cavity between two
metal plates that connect the orbiter and external tank, Diller
said. Twenty-one sensors were placed around the suspected area, a
17-inch-diameter valve in a pipe that runs through both plates.
   The external tank was drained following the 2{-hour test.
   ``This test should really point us to it,'' said Bascom Murrah, a
NASA official in charge of Columbia's prelaunch operations. ``If we
don't find it, we're going to be one unhappy puppy.''
   NASA officials fear Columbia will have to be returned to the
hangar for repairs, which would delay its trip into orbit with the
$150 million Astro observatory by about a month.
   A launch attempt last week was scrubbed because of a hydrogen
leak in the engine compartment during fueling with liquid hydrogen
and liquid oxygen. The mission already was two weeks late because of
cooling system repairs.
   Workers were cleared from the launch pad during today's hazardous
test. Hydrogen is highly combustible.

   Prosecutors in the drug and perjury trial of
Mayor Marion Barry say Barry has tried to ``infect'' the jury by
accusing the government of leaking a videotape that allegedly shows
him smoking crack cocaine.
   As jury selection continued slowly and U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson complained of falling ``way, way behind schedule,''
Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Roberts complained that Barry was
generating negative publicity and turning sentiment toward him
before his trial began.
   The selection process resumed today with the questioning of three
prospective jurors. Jackson ordered prosecutors and defense
attorneys to limit their questioning to five minutes for each
prospective juror, in an attempt to speed up the process.
   On Monday, Barry said in a local radio interview that the
government leaked to a television station a copy of the FBI tape
that allegedly shows him smoking crack at a Washington hotel on the
night of his arrest last Jan. 18.
   Roberts suggested to Jackson in court Tuesday that Barry had
engaged in an attempt to ``infect the jury pool'' with his broadcast
remarks. He said the mayor's statements were inaccurate and that in
generating ``negative editorial publicity,'' he ``makes these
comments at his own peril.''
   U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens told reporters later that the
government's copy of the tape ``was locked up securely. I can assure
you of that.''
   By the end of the day, only 12 of a pool of 250 potential jurors
had been questioned.
   Among the nine of that group tentatively selected as jurors were
a 70-year-old woman who says she believes politicians are dishonest,
an FBI clerk, two Washington lawyers, a District of Columbia
government worker, a journalist and two retirees.
   Also in the group was a private school art teacher who initially
said ``it would be an effort'' to overcome her feeling that Barry
was guilty of at least some of the charges against him.
   Barry, who has pleaded innocent to the 14 charges against him,
says the government's case was the result of overreaching by federal
prosecutors.
   Defense lawyer R. Kenneth Mundy tried to exclude the art teacher
and the elderly woman from the jury pool, but Jackson said the nine
appear sufficiently impartial and rejected the request.
   The elderly woman asserted she would judge Barry as an
individual, not as a politician. The art teacher promised she would
heed the judge's instructions to presume Barry's innocence, despite
her personal feelings based on news accounts.
   Roberts and Mundy asked several potential jurors for their views
of FBI sting operations and electronic surveillance. Both techniques
were used in the Barry case, in which authorities burst into the
hotel room after allegedly watching the mayor smoke crack.
   A jury of 12 jurors and six alternates will be selected from a
pool that probably will number 35 to 45 Washington residents.
   Barry's lawyers said they may call his campaign manager and an
indicted former city official as defense witnesses at the mayor's
drug and perjury trial.
   Mundy said in court that he wanted Anita Bonds, the campaign
manager, added to the list of possible witnesses. Bonds sat next to
Barry at the defense table during much of the day's proceedings.
   Also added to the list was David Rivers, the former director of
the city's Department of Human Services and a close friend of Barry.
Rivers is on trial in the same courthouse, accused of illegally
steering city contracts to friends and business associates.
   Barry is charged with 10 counts of cocaine possession, three
counts of lying to a grand jury and one count of conspiracy. The
three perjury counts are felonies, the others misdemeanors.

<TEXT>
   East German retailers, restaurant owners and
other businessmen today called on their workers to strike next week
because many will lose their jobs when the German states merge their
economies next month.
   Three associations representing thousands of small and
medium-sized businesses said perhaps half East Germany's enterprises
would be unable to compete under the terms of the economic treaty
between the Germanys.
   Klaus Noack, head of the Association for Independent Businesses,
said 350,000 workers would lose their jobs this summer and 3 million
more jobs would be threatened. Some analysts have put the figure
even higher.
   Noack, leaders from the Chamber of Commerce and other business
groups will call a strike on East Germany's Baltic Sea island of
Reugen Tuesday, and a nationwide strike the following week unless
Parliament acts on their demands.
   ``We feel that all along we have been abandoned,'' Dieter Froese,
head of the Association for Independent Businesses, said in an
interview Wednesday with the East Berlin newspaper Berliner Zeitung.
   The East German newspaper Berliner Zeitung had reported the city
strike would be on Friday and the nationwide strike on Saturday.
However, officials later said at a news conference the strikes would
not be called this week.
   The German states are to merge their economies on July 2, when
East Germany will officially become a free market. Businesses once
controlled by the former Communist government will be free to
compete, but many sell products that are increasingly shunned by
East Germans.
   The call to strike came despite the government's announcement a
day earlier that it will spend $1.25 billion to retrain workers and
pay them compensatory wages for lost or reduced salaries.
   Under the government's program announced Tuesday, East German
industries will reduce wages and hours of many workers rather than
lay them off, said Labor and Social Minister Regine Hildebrandt.
   Workers will receive compensation payments for time spent
receiving retraining. Their reduced wages and the supplemental
payments combined will likely be lower than their wages, but higher
than jobless benefits, said Mrs. Hildebrandt.
   Government figures released Tuesday showed joblessness tripled
last month.At the end of June, 100,000 people were officially
unemployed, about 1 percent of the work force, but nearly three
times the 35,000 recorded in mid-April, Mrs. Hildebrandt said.
   Even though a 1 percent jobless rate is minuscule by Western
standards, the speed with which it materialized is alarming in a
nation where joblessness was once officially non-existent, she said.
   She predicted high unemployment in the coming months.
   ``We must build a dam against unemployment,'' said West German
Labor Minister Norbert Bluem in an interview published today in the
West German newspaper Bild.
   East Germany is to officially shed four decades of socialism on
July 2 when it merges its economy and social institutions with West
Germany _ the biggest and most difficult stage of full German
unification.
   Officials in both German states are counting on a flood of
Western investment to create new employment.
   But many East Germans are not waiting to find out. West Germany
said Tuesday that East Germans are still fleeing to West Germany at
a rate of 2,000 a week, and that more than 180,000 have done so this
year alone.
   Hundreds of thousands fled last year, an exodus that opened the
Berlin Wall and helped bring down the former socialist regime in
October.
   Western firms already have begun taking over parts of the East
German economy. Western food imports, for example, fill East German
grocery stores and many East Germans have been buying Western
clothing and electronics.
   The effect has been to speed the decline of many East German
industries.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers in the
United States and abroad.
   June 4
   The Dallas Morning News on honorariums:
   Apparently, the political liabilities connected with accepting
speaking fees have become too great for 34 senators. A spot check by
Congressional Quarterly magazine has found that the lawmakers are
either declining all honorariums from outside groups or directing
the money to charity. That number is 15 more than last year.
   For many voters, the practice among lawmakers of accepting
speaking fees from the same special interests that seek to influence
them has become a striking symbol of what is wrong with Congress.
Last year, House members, in exchange for a pay raise, voted to ban
honorariums beginning in 1991. But the Senate refused to follow suit.
   Instead, the senators adopted a wimpish plan to abolish speaking
fees gradually, reducing the amount they can keep each year by the
amount they receive in cost-of-living salary increases. Judging by
the Congressional Quarterly survey, however, a fair number have
taken it upon themselves to end the payoffs immediately.
   Good for them. ...
   Ideally, the Senate will come to its senses soon and ban
honorariums altogether, with or without a pay raise. Until then, one
can only hope that these examples of self-denial catch on.

   The News-Review, Roseburg, Ore., on Navy sexual harassment:
   Adm. Carlisle Trost, chief of naval operations, is to be
commended for his tough stand against sexual harassment. That's
something the Navy just won't tolerate, he says. Unfortunately,
Trost's assurance comes too late to help Gwen Marie Dreyer.
   Dreyer, a 19-year-old midshipman at the U.S. Naval Academy,
resigned in protest because she felt the Navy dealt too leniently
with male colleagues who abused, assaulted and harassed her.
   She was dragged from her dormitory room in Annapolis, Md., by two
male midshipmen and handcuffed to a urinal in a men's rest room
while others jeered and took photographs.
   Incredibly, academy superintendent Rear Adm. Virgil Hill
concluded after an investigation that the incident was not
premeditated and therefore did not constitute sexual harassment. The
view of the academy was that it was a student prank, nothing more
than spontaneous high jinks.
   The punishment was commensurably light. ...
   There is good reason to believe that this incident was far
removed from an innocent, spontaneous prank. The very fact that
Dreyer was taken to a men's rest room takes this episode beyond
hazing to sexual harassment.
   The Navy has the responsibility to review the Dreyer case, not
the least because it appears to condone intolerable behavior. ...
The leaders of tomorrow's Navy should be persons of sensitivity and
understanding, not boors who revel in the humiliation of others.

   Marinette (Wis.) Eagle-Star on the Iowa explosion investigation:
   Thumbs down to the U.S. Navy for blowing a smokescreen in front
of the death of a sailor aboard the U.S.S. Iowa last year. New
evidence ... casts serious doubts upon the Navy's theory that the
explosion in one of the ship's gun turrets was caused by a suicidal
sailor. It now appears the explosion that killed 47 was an accident.
   This case is one of several in recent memory where the Navy has
tried to pass the buck for the death of one of its own. ...
   It seems naive for the Navy to think they could get away with
these coverups. Their actions are causing pain, suffering and
embarrassment to the families involved and erode the framework on an
institution that is supposed to stand for honor.

   The Phoenix Gazette on criminal restitution:
   To the average person, it is unfortunate when a white-collar
criminal avoids prison, but it is at least understandable when the
price for that avoidance is to pay restitution to the persons
victimized. Thus a swindler could pay back the millions of dollars
he stole and get a light sentence or no prison time at all.
   Well, the U.S. Supreme Court has just thrown a little monkey
wrench into the equation. The court, by a 7-2 vote, decided that
criminals may avoid paying restitution if they file bankruptcy,
since the bankruptcy law makes no mention of an exception for
court-ordered restitution.
   The court probably reads the law correctly, but the law is wrong.
Congress should fix this loophole before the courts are faced with
dozens of white-collar criminals from the S&amp;L collapse, all
accepting restitution with their fingers crossed behind them.

   The Bakersfield (Calif.) Californian on Kohl and a unified
Germany:
   A funny thing happened on Helmut Kohl's way to the presidency of
a united Germany. Since the Berlin Wall began to figuratively
crumble, public opinion polls have shown that the West German
chancellor was the preference of East and West Germans to lead a
unified Germany. ...
   Sensing a delay in a vote might prevent him from heading a single
Germany, Kohl now wants the unity election in December, six months
sooner than he planned. ...
   The politically savvy Kohl is not waiting to get a firm figure on
unification costs. He wants the prestige of being the first unified
German leader since World War II. Delay, he knows, could be deadly
for him.
   Besides the threat of defecting West German voters, Kohl has to
consider the East German voters. ... (His) backing could erode if
expected massive unemployment sends East Germans rushing to the arms
of the Social Democrats who traditionally appeal to disadvantaged
workers. ...
   The West German chancellor will try everything he can to get
elected president of a unified Germany in 1990. He knows that come
1991 he may no longer be the favorite.

   The Albuquerque (N.M.) Tribune on China:
   When the late Chou En-lai, Chinese Communist elder statesman, was
asked to assess the impact of the French Revolution of 1789, he is
said to have answered: ``Too soon to tell.'' No doubt he would scorn
attempts to capture the meaning of Tiananmen Square after just one
year.
   Yet it is fair to speculate. We are convinced, for example, that
the brutal suppression of peaceful pro-democracy demonstrators by
China's communist government a year ago ... helped prevent a similar
use of force in Eastern Europe.
   The Tiananmen Square massacre occurred at a key moment in the
unfolding ferment of European communism.
   We don't know exactly why Moscow decided to let Eastern Europe
go. Generational change in the leadership is surely fundamental. But
we suspect it helped that the images of Tiananmen Square were fresh
in Soviet leaders' minds when they had to choose between holding
Eastern Europe by force and watching it break free.

   The Providence (R.I.) Journal Bulletin on Boris Yeltsin:
   There may now be, in effect, two leaders of the Soviet ``Union'':
Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin.
   In winning the presidency of Russia, the USSR's largest republic,
... Yeltsin has established himself as a formidable rival to the
floundering Soviet president. And his victory has cast into further
doubt the future unity of the Soviet empire. ...
   It should be emphasized that nobody exactly knows what sort of an
animal ... Yeltsin is; his views on many policies are contradictory
and confused. ...
   Equally important to remember is that ... Yeltsin has actually
been elected by the people through landslide victories in
legislative races. ... Gorbachev, on the other hand, has never had
to undergo an open, contested election.
   Perhaps ... Gorbachev will take the Yeltsin election as a sign
that he's running out of time, and so needs to step up the pace of
reform.

   The Saginaw (Mich.) News on the summit:
   The events of the next several years will provide a measuring
stick for President Bush's laid-back approach to the U.S.-Soviet
summit.
   Bush was dealing from a position of strength in his talks with
the beleaguered Mikhail Gorbachev, but he didn't play his trump
cards.
   Gorbachev came away with two big prizes. He received a political
prop through the telecasts of the ceremonial pomp back home. And, in
the process, Bush gave him a trade agreement to sate a population
that desires not only political freedom, but Western products.
   For Bush, however, the pot was virtually empty. He did not press
hard for an end to the Soviet economic embargo of Lithuania, even
though Gorbachev was desperate for the trade pact. The weapons
accord is rooted in the fluff of general long-range goals, with the
tough detail work to come later. ...
   But if the United States props up Gorbachev and helps him
survive, and if the Soviet leader grows stronger in his push for
reforms, then historians will laud Bush for a display of wisdom. ...
   Indeed, it is in America's best interest to assist Gorbachev, who
for the most part has reduced hostilities and oppression. It isn't a
question of ``trusting'' him; the proof rests in his actions, and
most have been positive.

   Valley News, Lebanon, N.H., on the summit:
   (Soviet President Mikhail) Gorbachev's visit, of course, has
provided a wonderful opportunity for analysts to speculate on his
chances for survival.
   Such speculation makes for interesting reading, but seems to be
an exercise with less certainty than guessing next week's weather.
   Whatever transpires, Gorbachev's visit serves as a reminder of
how much he has already accomplished.
   One can criticize him on a range of issues, but the fact remains
that he has catalyzed an unimaginable amount of change, much of it
exceeding Americans' wildest dreams.

   Former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein,
whose campaign was sputtering less than a year ago, roared back to
win the Democratic nomination to face U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson in the
November election for governor.
   On a primary day that bucked tradition, Californians also voted
Tuesday to double their gasoline taxes, oust an incumbent mayor and
spend billions of dollars on transportation improvements.
   Feinstein's victory over Attorney General John Van de Kamp took
her as close as any woman has ever stood to winning the California
governorship _ a feat all the more remarkable for a politician from
Northern California, not the more populous south.
   ``Well, we did it,'' Feinstein told supporters at her San
Francisco campaign headquarters. ``One mission completed. One more
to go. I think we have shown tonight that we are one state, not
northerners versus southerners. We are one state and proud of it.''
   Van de Kamp, conceding defeat in Los Angeles, said the former San
Francisco mayor had hammered out ``an extraordinary victory,''
running a campaign that overwhelmed his own.
   ``I feel a little tonight like the auto mechanic who was run over
by a Corvette, (who says) `I think my leg is broken, but did you see
that car?''' he told supporters.
   Wilson, who cruised to victory against token opposition,
congratulated Feinstein even before Van de Kamp conceded defeated.
But he issued a warning to the Democratic nominee.
   ``My friends in the Democratic Party: Whoop it up tonight because
this is your last victory party of the 1990s,'' Wilson said in his
victory speech.
   Feinstein's victory came months after her campaign was all but
written off by most political leaders. But a savvy advertising
campaign _ and an infusion of money, much of it her own _ helped
rescue her candidacy and put it on the road to victory.
   With 99 percent of the precincts reporting early today, Feinstein
had 1,288,749 votes to Van de Kamp's 1,007,251 _ a 52-to-41 percent
margin. Nine lesser-known Democrats split the remaining 7 percent.
   Wilson, California's junior U.S. senator, swamped three
lesser-known GOP rivals to capture 89 percent of the vote.
   Proposition 111, the measure to raise the state gasoline tax from
9 cents to 18 cents per gallon, won by a 53-to-47 percent margin. A
companion $1 billion rail bond measure won by 56 percent to 44
percent, while a rival $1.99 billion rail bond measure won by a 53
percent to 47 percent.
   Voters rejected two ballot measures that would have stripped the
Democratic Legislature of much of its power to set the boundaries of
California legislative districts.
   Several races featured new political faces with familiar family
names.
   Incumbent Tom Hayes defeated Angela ``Bay'' Buchanan, former U.S.
treasurer and sister of conservative commentator Pat Buchanan, by a
3-2 margin for the Republican nomination for state treasurer.
Kathleen Brown, daughter of former Gov. Pat Brown and sister of
former Gov. Jerry Brown, won the Democratic nomination for treasurer
by a similar margin.
   Secretary of State March Fong Eu won the Democratic nomination in
her quest to serve a fifth term as the state's chief election
officer, while her son, Matt Fong, was unopposed in his bid for the
Republican nomination for state controller.
   Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson, criticized for his failed attempt to
lure the Los Angeles Raiders football team back to his city, lost in
his bid for a fifth term. Two rivals, state Assemblyman Elihu Harris
and city Councilman Wilson Riles Jr., were forced into a November
runoff.
   California's 45 congressional races included several interesting
contests:
   _Democratic incumbent Rep. Jim Bates, who was challenged in the
Democratic primary after being rebuked by the House Ethics Committee
for sexual harassment of women employees, won renomination for a
fifth term.
   _Actor Ralph Waite, ``Papa Walton'' of the old ``The Waltons'' TV
series, won the Democratic nomination for a seat now held by
Republican Al McCandless in the Palm Springs area.
   _Tim Stoen, former attorney for People's Temple before the cult's
mass suicide with 912 deaths over a decade ago, lost the Republican
nomination to oppose Democratic incumbent Doug Bosco in California's
north coast redwood country. Frank Riggs won by a 79-21 percent
margin.

<DATELINE>AYR, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American arrested after an alleged bomb
threat against a Pan Am jetliner has been charged under Britain's
aviation safety laws, police said today.
   Swaeid Ebrahimi, 37, from Long Beach, Calif. made a brief court
appearance and was ordered to remain in custody for seven days, said
prosecutor Will Andrew.
   Ebrahimi was not required to enter a plea. His court-appointed
attorney, Robert Campbell, said he denies all offenses and denies
that he told anyone there were explosives on a Pan Am Boeing 747.
   Ebrahimi was arrested Tuesday after Flight 61 from Frankfurt,
West Germany, to Washington, D.C., made an emergency landing that
night at Scotland's Prestwick Airport after a bomb scare.
   A statement issued by Strathclyde police, based in Glasgow, said:
``the crew received an allegation that there was possibly an
explosive device on board.''
   Police blew up two pieces of baggage taken from the plane but
said they found no explosives. The officials declined to say who
owned the luggage.
   After a five-hour delay the flight continued across the Atlantic
with 208 passengers and crewmembers, said Strathclyde police.
   Ebrahimi, a self-employed architectural model maker, is charged
with violating Section 3 of the Aviation Security Act of 1982,
Campbell said.
   ``Section 3 is an offense to intentionally communicate any false
information which endangers the safety of an aircraft in flight,''
Andrew said.
   Police and court officials refused any further comment on the
case.

   Il Tempo, Rome, on the summit:
   George Bush wished his guest ``good luck'' as (Michael Gorbachev)
boarded his limousine. It was the last one-liner of the Soviet-U.S.
summit, the one that summarizes it best. ...
   Gorbachev will need a lot of luck to stay where he is and to win
the many challenges lying in wait as he returns to Moscow. ...
   Speculation? No. Gorbachev himself spoke to the matter in the
closing press conference: the difficulties and delays of
perestroika, the rebellion of Boris Yeltsin, recently installed
president of the Russian republic, the obstinance of secessionist
Lithuania, the fury of a population faced with empty stores, and the
loss of authority. ...
   Gorbachev left Washington in approximately the same state of mind
as Richard Nixon, when he left Moscow 16 years ago. He took back
home the feeling of having gained additional time. Hounded by
Watergate, Nixon lasted a few months. How many will there be for
Gorbachev?

   Times of India, New Delhi, on Soviet economic reforms:
   (Soviet President Mikhail) Gorbachev's decision to submit his
proposals for revamping the economy to a public referendum will be
seen by many to be a desperate gamble. The Soviet economy is in a
shambles. ...
   This has pushed most of his economic advisers into ever greater
pessimism about the possibility of effectively ``reforming'' the
socialist economy as distinct from simply abandoning it altogether
in favor of a full-fledged market system. ...
   Gorbachev's effort to seek public endorsement via a referendum
and his hyperbole about the economic reform he is promoting being as
profound a matter as the consequences of the October Revolution
itself shows how fragile his own situation is. ...
   It is almost certain that his new economic package will not do
the trick. All efforts at decentralizing the socialist economy ...
have ultimately failed. ...
   But if ... Gorbachev goes in for Polish-style ``shock therapy''
he will almost certainly provoke mass upsurges from an industrial
work force which in numerical terms is the largest in the world.

   Daily Telegraph, London, on China:
   A year after the Beijing massacre, China is subdued. The old men
who ordered the crushing of the pro-democracy movement have little
to fear in the immediate future. ...
   The drying up of foreign credit has hurt the economy, which in
turn makes the party's hold on power less secure. Politically,
Western disapproval has marginalized China, in stark contrast to the
period during which it was wooed as a standard-bearer of communist
reform. ...
   As the anniversary of the massacre passes, Western governments
may well decide to relax their sanctions _ in particular, to reopen
lines of credit to Beijing.
   As a response to real need, this would be acceptable, provided
the donors reiterate their condemnations of China's human rights
record, whether in conducting vendettas at home, harassing exiled
dissidents, interfering in Hong Kong's internal affairs or brutally
crushing unrest in Tibet. Dealing with fading ideologues in Beijing
may be a necessity, but there is no reason for the West to go out of
its way to be friendly.

   The family of a sailor who drowned during
a rescue drill is challenging the legal doctrine that bans lawsuits
against the military for deaths or injuries ``incident to service.''
   The U.S. Supreme Court laid down what is called the Feres
doctrine in 1950 when it refused to let survivors of Rudolf J.
Feres, a soldier killed in a barracks fire, sue the government under
the Federal Tort Claims Act.
   In action filed Monday, a lawyer for the family of Airman Recruit
Lee Mirecki urged U.S. District Judge Winston Arnow to overrule the
Feres doctrine claiming it is contrary to the intent of Congress, as
well as unfair and irrational.
   Failing that, wrote Martin Levin, Arnow should rule the doctrine
doesn't apply to the Mirecki case either because his death at the
Navy Rescue Swimmer School was not incident to service or because he
had withdrawn from the Navy _ which he was allowed by contract to do
_ by repeatedly shouting ``I quit'' as instructors forced him back
into a training pool.
   ``When the military personnel know, or should know, that they are
violating the clear constitutional rights of a serviceman, the court
should rule that the acts ... are so egregious that it cannot be
said that the injury resulted `incident to service,''' Levin wrote.
   Mirecki, 19, of Appleton, Wis., died March 2, 1988, at the
Pensacola Naval Air Station of drowning and heart failure induced by
fear, a Navy pathologist testified during a subsequent court martial.
   One instructor was convicted of negligent homicide and sentenced
to 90 days in the brig. A second trial cleared the officer in charge
of the school of dereliction of duty. Four other instructors
received administrative penalties. The commander of the Naval
Aviation Schools Command was reprimanded.
   Mirecki's mother, Elaine M. Kitowski, and the sailor's estate are
seeking $7.5 million.
   The government has asked that the lawsuit be dismissed because of
the Feres doctrine. Arnow will rule on that motion after the
government responds to Levin's argument.
   Mirecki had signed a statement permitting him to ``drop on
request'' from Rescue Swimmer School.

   South Korean President Roh Tae-woo said today
that he and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev have agreed to
undertake a joint effort to ``melt down the ice'' that still exists
from the Cold War.
   Speaking to reporters after conferring with President Bush, Roh
also said a peace settlement on the Korean peninsula could lead to
further reductions or reallocations of American forces in South
Korea.
   Roh met with Bush two days after his groundbreaking meeting with
Gorbachev in San Francisco, the first such encounter since Korea was
divided after World War II.
   Roh said he and Gorbachev agreed to cooperate ``so that we can
melt down the ice that still exists from the cold war years.''
   Asked about prospects for reunification with North Korea, Roh
said that country must first open up and embark on a reform process.
He said Gorbachev ``agreed to combine efforts along that line.''
   He said the meeting will help reduce tensions on the peninsula
and expressed hope it will ``help greatly the process of
reunification.''
   Earlier, as the two leaders posed for photographers in the Oval
Office, Bush described as ``very important'' the San Francisco
meeting.
   Roh said he was pleased that the meeting with Gorbachev took
place in the United States.
   Bush received Roh after the South Korean had breakfast with Vice
President Dan Quayle.
   There was a sense of optimism as Roh flew here Tuesday from San
Francisco to brief Bush on his meeting.
   ``This historic meeting has improved prospects for peace on the
Korean peninsula and eventual Korean unification,'' State Department
deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said.
   Roh predicted the meeting eventually will lead to full diplomatic
relations with Moscow.
   The administration is hopeful that, absent the unswerving support
of Soviet Union, communist North Korea will be more likely to seek
friendlier ties with South Korea and the industrialized West.
   In his remarks Monday, Roh noted that the Gorbachev era in Moscow
has brought a generalized easing of East-West tensions except in
Korea.
   ``The Korean peninsula remains the last area of tension in the
Cold War,'' he said. ``The Cold War on the Korean peninsula now
begins to crack.''
   On Tuesday, Roh called the meeting ``the greatest diplomatic
event'' in South Korean history and said efforts would be made to
establish ties with another longtime rival, China.
   U.S. officials expressed delight with the prospective
accommodation between Seoul and Moscow, recalling that it was less
than seven years ago that a Soviet missile shot down a Korea
commercial jetliner, killing all 269 people aboard. In the
aftermath, Soviet-American relations hit a low point.
   The Bush administration attached significance to the
Roh-Gorbachev meeting because Korea has long been viewed as one of
the most likely areas for an East-West showdown.
   It is an area where tensions often have run high, where there are
heavy concentrations of military weapons and where both Moscow and
Washington have vital interests.
   The meeting with Gorbachev occurred just three weeks short of the
40th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War, a conflict in
which the Kremlin was the major arms supplier of North Korea while
the United States provided arms and troops for the South.
   The weapons deliveries by the two superpowers have continued
unabated ever since. One potential benefit of an eventual
accommodation between the two Koreas would be the withdrawal of the
40,000 American troops stationed in South Korea.
   The meeting also came at a time of some indications by North
Korea of interest in improving relations with the United States.
Just last week, it returned the remains of five American servicemen
killed during the Korean war, the first such gesture since 1954.

   Dianne Feinstein, savoring success in California's Democratic
primary for governor, embarked on her fall campaign today against
well-financed GOP rival Pete Wilson. North Carolina Democrats picked
a black man to try to dethrone GOP Sen. Jesse Helms.
   In the longest count of a nine-state primary election, Alabama
Attorney General Don Siegelman squeezed into a runoff for the
Democratic nomination for governor with teacher lobbyist Paul
Hubbert after an all-night vote tally. The winner of the June 26
balloting will face GOP Gov. Guy Hunt.
   Seven senators gained nominations for new terms. GOP Sen. Thad
Cochran of Mississippi was arguably the biggest winner among them.
He faces no Democratic opposition in the fall and is thus assured of
a new term.
   Democrats Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Howell Heflin of Alabama
and Max Baucus of Montana easily overcame challenges within their
party, while Democrat Tom Harkin of Iowa and Republicans Larry
Pressler of South Dakota and Pete Domenici of New Mexico were
unopposed.
   Incumbent governors in Iowa and South Dakota also were
renominated, along with Hunt in Alabama.
   In California, both Feinstein and Wilson, a second-term senator,
were kicking off their fall campaigns with breakfast appearances.
   ``Whoop it up tonight because this is your last victory party of
the 1990s,'' Wilson told the Democrats late Tuesday night after
breezing to his nomination.
   Democratic national chairman Ron Brown hailed Feinstein's success
and called the defeat of two Republican-backed redistricting
referenda a ``blowout for us.''
   ``They are going to have a money advantage,'' he said, referring
to Wilson's $3 million warchest. But, he added, ``issues are going
to prevail.''
   It was the California Democratic primary for governor that drew
most of the nationwide attention, both for the size of the state and
because the next governor will play a large role in determining
which party benefits from a census that may increase the state's
congressional delegation by a half-dozen seats.
   ``One mission completed, one to go,'' former San Francisco Mayor
Feinstein told supporters after securing her victory in a
hard-fought primary.
   With 99 percent of the precincts counted, she had 52 percent of
the vote, to 41 percent for Attorney General John Van de Kamp. Nine
other candidates split the remaining votes.
   Wilson breezed to an easy primary victory on the GOP side, and
said he'd keep the governor's office in Republican hands. He decided
to run for the job when GOP Gov. George Deukmejian declined to seek
a third term.
   Feinstein praised Van de Kamp in her victory speech and said the
fall campaign will be a choice between two Californias. ``One ...
with a declining quality of life, more crime, more traffic ... It is
content with caretaker government,'' she said. ``But our California
is a ... bold place.''
   In North Carolina, Helms congratulated Harvey Gantt on ``a
hard-earned victory.''
   ``How sweet it is,'' a jubilant Gantt told supporters after
dispatching prosecutor Mike Easley with 57 percent of the vote. His
victory made him the first of his race to win a Senate nomination
this century in North Carolina.
   ``I want to tell you that God is good, yes he is. It's a new day
in North Carolina,'' said Gantt, a former mayor of Charlotte.
   Alabama boasted the closest race of the night, a Democratic
primary to pick an opponent for incumbent GOP Gov. Guy Hunt.
   Education Association lobbyist Hubbert and Siegelman claimed the
right to face off in the runoff. With 96 percent of precincts
reporting, Hubbert was winning 32 percent of the vote and Siegelman
25 percent, followed by former Gov. Fob James with 22 percent and
Rep. Ronnie Flippo 17 percent. Two other candidates trailed.
   ``This is no place for the faint-hearted,'' said Flippo as the
long count continued.
   In an Iowa primary contest viewed as a referendum on abortion,
House Speaker Don Avenson claimed the Democratic nomination for
governor against GOP incumbent Terry Branstad, who opposes abortion.
Avenson, who favors abortion rights, won 40 percent of the vote to
defeat anti-abortion Democrat Tom Miller and three other contenders.
The National Organization for Women and the National Abortion Rights
ActionLeague, both of which endorsed Avenson, had feared he would
split the vote with other pro-choice contenders and permit Miller to
win.
   In addition to picking candidates for governor, Californians
voted to raise the state gasoline tax from 9 to 18 cents a gallon to
finance badly needed highway repair. Supporters said approval of the
measure would mark a symbolic end to the tax revolt that began in
1978 with passage of Proposition 13. With 98 percent of precincts
counted, the proposal was gaining 52 percent of the vote.
   The lines were drawn for what shape up as some of the nation's
most contested Senate elections in November, when Republicans seek
to cut into the current 55-45 Democratic advantage.
   Republicans count Harkin as among the most vulnerable Democrats,
and Rep. Tom Tauke has been campaigning against him even in advance
of formally claiming the GOP nomination Tuesday night.
   Republicans profess hope for knocking off two-term Democrat Max
Baucus in Montana, as well. The victor in a four-way GOP race was
Lt. Gov. Allen Kolstad, who entered the race at the urging of the
national Republican leadership.
   In New Jersey, Christine Todd Whitman was unopposed for the GOP
nomination to oppose Bradley. In Alabama, state Sen. Bill Cabannis
had no GOP opposition for the chance to challenge Heflin.
   GOP Sen. Domenici in New Mexico will face Democratic State Sen.
Tom Benavides, who was unopposed for his party's nomination.
   On the other side of the aisle, Democrats eye Pressler of South
Dakota as a potential victim for the fall. Ted Muenster, who had no
primary opposition, will run against him.
   In New Mexico's governor's race, former Gov. Bruce King won the
Democratic nomination in a bid to regain the office he's held for
eight years _ longer than anyone in state history. Former state Rep.
Frank Bond won the Republican nomination. Each man defeated three
rivals.

   Checkpoint Charlie, the most famous crossing
through the now-crumbling Berlin Wall, is going to be dismantled,
the U.S. military said today.
   ``Plans are in motion for the eventual removal of Allied
Checkpoint Charlie. We will announce the date of the ceremony and
the disposition of the building when a final decision is made,''
said a statement from the U.S. Command Berlin.
   Capt. Pete Pierce, spokesman for the U.S. military, said he could
not confirm German news media reports that the checkpoint will be
taken down this month.
   ``No decision has been made on the date,'' Pierce told The
Associated Press.
   German officials have already said they will end all passport and
identity card checks at the Berlin Wall next month, when the West
German mark officially replaces the East German currency and the two
countries start to merge their economies.
   That completely free passage by itself will make Checkpoint
Charlie obsolete.

   The script called for President
Fernando Collor de Mello to set fire to a pile of seized cocaine and
marijuana to promote his anti-drug campaign, but it didn't work out
that way.
   Instead, TV viewers saw the gas-soaked pile of drugs explode in
flames as Collor dropped a torch onto it, and the president cover
his face and run back.
   Fortunately, the heat only singed Collor's right ear, hair and
forearm, and he was not seriously hurt, the government news agency
said Wednesday.
   Federal police chief Romeu Tuma said the explosion occurred at a

   The ranch is in the Pantanal region, a transit point for illegal

   Five white men were arrested in
connection with a politically motivated arson attack on a historic
building, the government said Wednesday.
   Three of the men were held and the other two were released after
questioning, the office of the Minister of Law and Order Adriaan
Vlok said.
   The men were arrested last weekend in connection with the May 23
nighttime attack on Melrose House in Pretoria. Police linked the
attack to right-wing groups that oppose the government's plans to
end apartheid.
   A treaty marking the 1902 surrender of the Boer (Afrikaner)
Republics to the British was signed at Melrose House. It is seen by
right-wing groups as a symbol of Afrikaner humiliation.

   President Bush today formally named Oklahoma
Gov. Henry Bellmon to head his delegation to observe Sunday's
elections in Bulgaria, where the United States has already expressed
concern about intimidation by the former Communist Party.
   The U.S. ambassador to Bulgaria, Sol Polansky, was also named to
the delegation, along with: former U.S. ambassador to Bulgaria Jack
Perry, now a political science professor at Davidson College in
North Carolina; Richard D. McLellan, a lawyer from Michigan;
Marshall L. Miller, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., and Eunice B.
Whittlesey, a Republican National Committeewoman from New York.
   Polansky flew to Copenhagen, Denmark, Tuesday to brief Secretary
of State James A. Baker III on the latest developments in the
election campaign. The State Department has charged the Bulgarian
Socialist Party, formerly the communists, with engaging in a pattern
of campaign irregularities.
   Last week it deplored violence in the build-up to what will be
the first multiparty elections in Bulgaria since World War II. An
army officer allegedly shot an election canvasser for the opposition
party to death in the town of Shumen, and there have been other
reported acts of violence.
   The State Department also expressed concern over anonymous
threats to opposition candidates and supporters and criticized a
shortage of newsprint for opposition party newspapers.
   Bellmon will be joined by his wife, Shirley, on the June 7-12
mission, which the governor announced Tuesday at a news conference
in Oklahoma.

   Teacher lobbyist Paul Hubbert led the
Democratic primary for governor and Attorney General Don Siegelman
ran second to set the stage for a runoff in three weeks.
   A Hubbert-Siegelman matchup was a wish come true for Gov. Guy
Hunt, who won renomination Tuesday in a Republican primary
landslide. He billed the two Democrats as liberals out of step with
Alabama voters.
   Another landslide victor was Democratic U.S. Sen. Howell Heflin,
who used the primary as a warm-up for his general election campaign
against Republican state Sen. Bill Cabaniss.
   Alabama voters also gave lopsided approval to a proposed
constitutional amendment making English the state's official
language. The measure gives state residents the right to sue if the
amendment is violated, but does not define what constitutes a
violation.
   Former Gov. Fob James trailed Siegelman in the unofficial and
fell short of a spot in the June 26 runoff, as did U.S. Rep. Ronnie
Flippo.
   ``We'll beat whoever they put in there,'' said Hubbert, cheered
on by supporters as he turned his first statewide race for public
office into a success.
   The 54-year-old Alabama Education Association's executive
director, he promised ``new leadership'' and a progressive
Statehouse to rival those in other Southern states.
   With 97 of the precincts reporting, Hubbert had 227,430 votes, or
32 percent; Siegelman 176,609, or 25 percent; James 156,476, or 22
percent; Flippo 123,692, or 17 percent; state Sen. Charles Bishop
31,190, or 4 percent; and Ed Daw with 3,357, or less than 1 percent.
   A runnoff between the two top vote-getters is held if no one
candidate gets 50 percent of the vote.
   With 80 percent of the precincts reporting, results in the GOP
primary showed 115,861 votes, or 96 percent, for Hunt, to 3,117
votes, or 3 percent, for retired businessman Jim Watley's; and
2,283, or 2 percent, for highway employee Jack Pollard.
   In the Democratic Senate primary, Heflin had 407,714 votes, or 81
percent, to 96,323, or 19 percent, for Mrs. Frank Ross Stewart.
Cabaniss was unopposed in the GOP primary.
   The proposed English-language amendment received 329,827 votes,
or 89 percent, to 41,133, or 11 percent, with 2,240 of 4,196
precincts reporting.

<HEAD>Report: Torture Routine in Police Custody in Nepal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Torture has been routine in Nepalese police
stations, especially during the unrest that followed the birth of
the nation's pro-democracy movement in February, Amnesty
International said Wednesday.
   Many victims suffered broken limbs, had pins stuck under
fingernails, toenails ripped off and canes inserted into body
orifices, it said.
   ``Beatings, including on the soles of the feet, were
widespread,'' the worldwide human rights organization said.
   It said the findings were based on more than 80 interviews with
alleged victims by an Amnesty team that visited the Himalayan
kingdom in April. The team included a forensic expert familiar with
torture cases, it said.
   The charges were contained in a memorandum it said was being
presented to Nepal's prime minister, Krishna Prasad Bhattarai. In
April, a new government led by opposition figures took office as
part of the political reforms undertaken by King Birendra, who
previously held the monopoly on power.
   The army was called out in April after police fired on
pro-democracy demonstrators marching on Birendra's palace.
   Amnesty International's statement said the number of fatalities
was not known, but that estimates ranged from fewer than 20 to more
than 600 on April 6 alone. It said its team found evidence that
police several times ignored the rules on using live ammunition
against demonstrations.
   ``In a number of cases, demonstrators were shot in the head,
shoulders or chest, apparently in contravention of the specific
obligation ... not to shoot above the knees,'' it said. ``Police
officers also repeatedly obstructed doctors trying to help the
victims.''
   Amnesty International said thousands of people were arrested
during the disturbances and often kept in ``overcrowded and
unhygienic conditions.''
   It said its team was told of prisoners being refused access to
family and lawyers. In some cases their detention was not recorded,
raising ``the danger that detained people will go `missing' within
the system,'' the statement said.
   Amnesty International acknowledged that the difficulty of
maintaining proper records during mass arrests.
   It also noted that since April 6 most uncharged political
prisoners have been released and that the outgoing government
promised compensation to relatives of the dead and injured. But it
said some prisoners remained in custody, including Christians jailed
for proselytizing.
   The statement called on Bhattarai's government to write human
rights safeguards into Nepalese law, and outlaw torture,
incommunicado detention and summary executions.

   Three state appeals today sought to cut
through the philosophical arguments surrounding the fate of seven
frozen human embryos to reach a practical resolution.
   ``We have to make a decision about what to do with these
embryos,'' said presiding Judge Clifford E. Sanders as the Court of
Appeals heard arguments on a divorce decision that gave the embryos
to the wife.
   ``We're dealing with a very narrow issue here, and that's what to
do with these embryos,'' Judge Herschel P. Franks said, interrupting
a statement by one of the lawyers on the impact the case could have
on birth control methods. ``Let's keep to that issue.''
   Janet Mayfield, the attorney for Junior Davis, said Davis wants
control over whether he becomes a parent. She argued that he has a
constitutional right to make that decision.
   Kurt Erlenbach, the attorney for Mary Sue Davis Stowe, said his
client wants control of the embryos so she can give them up for
donation to some other infertile couple. Mrs. Stowe had said during
the divorce trial last year she wanted the embryos for implantation
in her womb in an effort to give birth.
   Since their divorce eight months ago, Davis, 31, and his
29-year-old ex-wife both have remarried. But their battle to control
the embryos continues. The embryos are in cryogenic storage at the
Knoxville in vitro fertilization clinic where they were created in
December 1988.
   Custody of the embryos was awarded to Mrs. Stowe on Sept. 21 by
Blount County Judge W. Dale Young, who treated the embryos as if
they were children in a custody dispute.
   Young ruled that life begins at conception, and said the embryos
thus deserved legal status and protection.
   Davis appealed, claiming the judge stepped beyond his bounds.
   During their four-day trial in August, Davis and Mrs. Stowe said
they would not consider the option of donating the embryos to some
other childless couple.
   In her response filed last week, however, Mrs. Stowe said she no
longer wants to use the embryos in an attempt to have children. She
now asks for control of the embryos so she can donate them for use
by someone else, according to Erlenbach's response.
   The appeals court is expected to take at least six weeks to reach
a decision. In Tennessee the state court of appeals is the
intermediate step between the Circuit Court, where the case was
heard, and the state Supreme Court.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Urge Prison Term for Poindexter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors said Wednesday that former national
security adviser John M. Poindexter should to go prison because he
subverted democratic principles by feeding Congress a ``diet of
lies'' about the Iran-Contra affair.
   A prison term would ``warn other high-ranking officials that
criminal violations of the public trust will result in more than
mere loss of public employment,'' prosecutors in the office of
independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh said in a memo to U.S.
District Judge Harold H. Greene.
   Poindexter, President Reagan's national security adviser from
late 1985 until the Iran-Contra affair unraveled in November 1986,
is scheduled to be sentenced Monday on five felony convictions.
   The retired Navy rear admiral faces up to 25 years in prison and
fines up to $1.25 million. He was convicted April 7 of conspiracy,
making false statements and obstructing congressional inquiries into
the sale of U.S. arms to Iran and covert aid to Nicaraguan Contras.
   Poindexter's lies, misleading statements and destruction of
documents ``did violence to this nation's fundamental principles of
government,'' prosecutors said. It is, they said, a ``system that
relies fundamentally upon the exchange of truthful information.''
   ``If, as occurred in this case, high-ranking officials of one
branch of government feel free to feed the other branch a diet of
lies, then the constitutional system will surely sicken and,
eventually, die,'' prosecutors said.
   The sentencing memo was filed as one of Poindexter's former
subordinates, retired Marine Lt. Col. Oliver L. North, resumed
testifying before a newly empaneled grand jury continuing to
investigate the Iran-Contra affair.
   North, a former National Security Council aide, gave seven hours
of testimony last week. He is appealing his own Iran-Contra
convictions.
   The grand jury is trying to determine if other Reagan
administration officials participated in efforts to conceal details
of the U.S.-Iran arms sales and the diversion of profits to the
Contras.
   The grand jury also is expected to try to make a final assessment
of the exact roles of Reagan and then-Vice President Bush in the
affair. Poindexter is expected to be subpoenaed to testify.
   In their sentencing memo, prosecutors urged the judge to ignore
pleas for leniency on the ground that neither North nor Robert
McFarlane, who preceded Poindexter as national security adviser, was
imprisoned for Iran-Contra convictions.
   Poindexter, prosecutors said, ``occupied a position where his
judgment was critical and in many instances _ if former President
Reagan's deposition testimony is any guide _ final.''
   Prosecutors said that McFarlane, unlike Poindexter, accepted
responsibility for his actions by pleading guilty to four
misdemeanor counts of withholding information from Congress and
cooperating with the investigation.

<HEAD>Blood Demand Falls During 1980s</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The use of blood transfusions began to fall in U.S.
hospitals during the 1980s, largely because of fear of passing on
AIDS, a nationwide study shows.
   The study found that transfusions of whole blood and red cells
began declining after a peak of 12.2 million pints in 1986. During
the mid-1980s, people have sharply increased the practice of setting
aside their own blood for use during operations.
   The study, directed by Dr. Douglas M. Surgenor of the Center for
Blood Research in Boston, was based on a survey of about 5,800
hospitals and blood centers. It was published in Thursday's New
England Journal of Medicine.
   Among the findings:
   _Transfusions of whole blood and red cells fell to 11.6 million
pints in 1987 and continued to decline in 1988, the last year of the
survey.
   _Transfusions of blood plasma dropped almost 9 percent during the
decade.
   _Donations of autologous blood _ the practice of setting aside
blood for one's own use _ increased from 30,000 pints in 1982 to
397,000 pints in 1987.
   _The supply of blood donated for others was unchanged between
1986 and 1988.
   The researchers attributed the changes to fear of passing on the
AIDS virus through transfusions. The chance of catching the disease
from a transfusion has been slight since blood banks began screening
for the virus in 1985.

<TEXT>
   Police detained former Communist
party chief Milos Jakes and at least four other ousted Communist
leaders, the official news agency said today, just two days before
the first free elections since 1946.
   Those taken into custody for questioning also included Vasil
Bilak, a former Communist party ideology chief accused of having
invited Soviet troops to Czechoslovakia in 1968.
   The others detained were former premier Jozef Lenart, and former
senior Communist Party leaders Michal Stefanak and Rudolf Hegenbart.
   The detentions were certain to deal another blow to the
Communists' credibility before the election Friday and Saturday for
the federal parliament and the Czech and Slovak legislatures.
   The official CTK news agency said Bilak was detained on suspicion
of ``committing serious criminal activity.'' It gave no reason for
the other detentions and did not say where they were being held.
   Bilak, 72, was picked up at midnight Tuesday from his home in the
Slovak capital of Bratislava, deputy interior minister Andrej Samel
said. He was detained for 48 hours, an official who identified
himself only as Secansky said from the general prosecutor`s office
in Bratislava.
   Jakes, Stefanak and Hegenbart, answered summons from police this
morning, Samel said. He said he did not know how long the four would
be interrogated.
   Jakes was Communist Party chief until Nov. 24, when he was ousted
along with all senior figures who had enforced orthodox Communist
rule after the Warsaw Pact invasion of August 1968 crushed the
``Prague Spring'' reforms.
   Hegenbart was named last week in a British Broadcasting Corp.
documentary that claimed he was involved in an alleged scheme with
the Soviet KGB to oust Jakes last November.
   ``The public is going to be informed about the future course of
the investigation,'' the terse CTK report that focused on Bilak said.
   Samel said the four summoned for interrogation were asked to help
police to ``clarify their activities related to the 1968 invasion
and possibly other criminal activities as well.
   ``They could have refused the summons, but willingly complied,''
he said.
   Jakes, Bilak and Lenart were all expelled from the party after
the November revolution that brought President Vaclav Havel to power.
   In this week's election, Havel's Civic Forum, which helped lead
the anti-Communist revolt, is expected to emerge as a strong force,
although not to win an outright majority.
   In April this year, Czechoslovak prosecutors launched an
investigation into the 1968 Soviet-led invasion. The investigation
was to clarify what prosecutors have termed ``all circumstances of
this criminal offense against peace.''
   That offense carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in jail.
   Lubomir Veleta, deputy general prosecutor said April 7 the main
aim of the investigation was to identify people responsible for
inviting the Soviet troops into Czechoslovakia.
   Bilak has long been accused to be the official who requested that
Soviet troops intervene, but he has denied the charges.
   The Czechoslovak government has officially requested that Soviet
authorities release all documents related to the invasion, but the
Kremlin has refused.
   ``The invasion of Soviet troops into Czechoslovakia in 1968 was
not decided on the basis of this or that appeal of individuals, if
there ever was such a thing,'' Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman
Vadim Perfiliev was quoted in a czechoslovak paper on May 29 as
saying.
   After the 1968 invasion, Bilak rose under the leadership of
fellow Slovak Gustav Husak to be chief Communist Party ideologue.

   Three state appeals today sought to cut
through the philosophical arguments surrounding the fate of seven
frozen human embryos to reach a practical resolution.
   ``We have to make a decision about what to do with these
embryos,'' said presiding Judge Clifford E. Sanders as the Court of
Appeals heard arguments on a divorce decision that gave the embryos
to the wife.
   ``We're dealing with a very narrow issue here, and that's what to
do with these embryos,'' Judge Herschel P. Franks said, interrupting
a statement by one of the lawyers on the impact the case could have
on birth control methods. ``Let's keep to that issue.''
   Janet Mayfield, the attorney for Junior Davis, said Davis wants
control over whether he becomes a parent. She argued that he has a
constitutional right to make that decision.
   Kurt Erlenbach, the attorney for Mary Sue Davis Stowe, said his
client wants control of the embryos so she can give them up for
donation to some other infertile couple. Mrs. Stowe had said during
the divorce trial last year she wanted the embryos for implantation
in her womb in an effort to give birth.
   Since their divorce eight months ago, Davis, 31, and his
29-year-old ex-wife both have remarried. But their battle to control
the embryos continues. The embryos are in cryogenic storage at the
Knoxville in vitro fertilization clinic where they were created in
December 1988.
   Custody of the embryos was awarded to Mrs. Stowe on Sept. 21 by
Blount County Judge W. Dale Young, who treated the embryos as if
they were children in a custody dispute.
   Young ruled that life begins at conception, and said the embryos
thus deserved legal status and protection.
   Davis appealed, claiming the judge stepped beyond his bounds.
   During their four-day trial in August, Davis and Mrs. Stowe said
they would not consider the option of donating the embryos to some
other childless couple.
   In her response filed last week, however, Mrs. Stowe said she no
longer wants to use the embryos in an attempt to have children. She
now asks for control of the embryos so she can donate them for use
by someone else, according to Erlenbach's response.
   The appeals court is expected to take at least six weeks to reach
a decision. In Tennessee the state court of appeals is the
intermediate step between the Circuit Court, where the case was
heard, and the state Supreme Court.

   Allied veterans armed with video
recorders returned to one of World War II's greatest battlefields
Wednesday to commemorate the man who sent them ashore to defeat Nazi
Germany, Dwight D. Eisenhower.
   Wind-driven rain lashed the Normandy beaches as veterans and
dignitaries from a dozen countries paid tribute to Eisenhower on the
100th year of his birth and the 46th anniversary of D-Day.
   ``I don't think there's any doubt that giving the order for this
operation was the most difficult decision my father ever made,''
said John Eisenhower, the general's son. ``But he never looked
back.''
   U.S. Army, Navy and Air Force brass and veterans of all ranks
appeared in solemn wreath-laying ceremonies at the American National
Cemetery on a bluff overlooking Omaha Beach.
   The annual D-Day commemoration took on a special meaning this
year as the Defense Department saluted the man who ordered the
biggest seaborne invasion in history.
   Some 200,000 predominantly American, British and Canadian
soldiers stormed onto the Normandy coast in landings coordinated
with paratroop drops, starting a campaign that less than a year
later toppled Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime. One million men eventually
landed on five Normandy beaches.
   Gen. John Galvin, commander of NATO forces in Europe, said
Eisenhower's dream of a peaceful Europe _ begun with the liberation
of Western Europe and the creation of NATO _ was near realization
due to the democratic changes sweeping Eastern Europe and various
U.S.-Soviet arms control agreements.
   ``As we look ahead now to a protracted peace and the great
opportunities that present themselves,'' said Galvin, ``I hope we
can honor the fighters who lay in this field, who died on the
beaches of France.''
   The immaculately manicured lawns hold the graves of 9,386 U.S.
servicemen. The field overlooks the sandy dunes where many of them
died in the bloodiest fighting of the D-Day landings.
   One Omaha Beach veteran who came to remember was Jack Boardman,
66, of Chicago.
   In the early hours of June 6, 1944, a transport ship dropped his
amphibious tank 10,000 yards out to sea. The first tank in his
batallion of 30 sank in the choppy English Channel.
   ``We went up the beach with the infantrymen,'' said Boardman,
wearing an Indiana Jones-style hat and a regimental patch on his
bush jacket. ``The tank commander hit me on the back and said,
`Shoot. Shoot.'
   ``I didn't know what to shoot at. Finally, I saw a dark
rectangle. It was one of the pillboxes,'' cement fortication housing
artillery or machineguns. ``So I just started shooting.''
   Later in the day, his tank lost both treads. His crew climbed out
and waded through bodies of dead U.S. soldiers three deep, mown down
by German mortar, artillary and machine-gun fire.
   Boardman is now close friends with one of those Germans, Heinrich
Severloh, of Metzingen, West Germany. Severloh, 67, remembers
``terror'' when dawn broke and he saw an Allied fleet of 7,000
warships heading straight at him.
   ``Shells were dropping everywhere,'' he recalled. ``Thank God
they were dropping behind us. I was a machine gunner. We waited for
the Americans to come ashore. When they were knee-deep, my officer
gave the order to fire.''
   Severloh's unit fell back that evening with no radio, ammunition
or commanding officer. A veteran of the Russian front, Severloh was
captured the next day.
   ``There are no enemies anymore,'' he said, putting an arm around
Boardman's shoulders.
   A flight of F-14 fighters from the Navy aircraft carrier U.S.S.
Eisenhower roared overhead as the 2,000 spectators looked on.
Wreaths were placed later at the Pointe du Hoc, a formidable German
artillary position lying between Omaha Beach and the other American
landing sight, Utah Beach, to the north.
   A commando force of 270 U.S. Rangers scaled the razor-like cliffs
of the Pointe just before the landings to knock out what commanders
feared could be a devastating firing point against the vulnerable
soldiers wading up both beaches. A day later, only 90 of the Rangers
were able to carry a weapon.
   John Eisenhower dedicated a monument to his father in an
overgrown farmer's field between Utah Beach and St. Lo where Gen.
Eisenhower set up his first field headquarters on the continent, and
where he first met Gen. Charles de Gaulle in France.
   This was the fourth stop on the ``journey to victory''
commemoration organized by the U.S. Department of Defense in honor
of the 100th anniversary of Eisenhower's birth. The events,
culminating at the Arc de Triomph in Paris Friday, were timed to
coincide with the 46th anniversary of the invasion rather than
Eisenhower's birthday on Oct. 14.
   Previous ceremonies were held in Britain and on the English
Channel aboard the carrier Eisenhower.

<HEAD>Dissidents' Son Says Parents' Spirits Good After Year in Embassy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Astrophysicist-turned-dissident Fang Lizhi longs
to see the sky but writes that he and his wife are in good spirits
and pursuing scientific research inside the U.S. Embassy in Beijing,
their son said.
   One year ago Tuesday, the two ``were forced to take refuge in the
U.S. Embassy in Beijing by a brutal and bloody situation and
increasing violation of their freedoms and human rights,'' said
their son Fang Ke, a physics student at Wayne State University in
Detroit. He communicates with his parents by letters.
   Little about Fang and his wife, Li Shuxian, is known since they
entered the embassy because they have declined to talk with
reporters. The embassy has refused to answer nearly all questions
about them.
   Their son spoke Tuesday night to a group gathered to mark the
publication of ``Children of the Dragon: The Story of Tiananmen
Square.'' The book was compiled by the New York-based group Human
Rights in China about last year's pro-democracy movement that ended
in violent military suppression June 3-4.
   Fang Lizhi and his wife, also a physicist, became well known for
their advocacy of democracy and human rights in China before last
year's demonstrations.
   The couple took refuge after being accused of inciting the
student-lead protests. The government has said they are
counterrevolutionaries.
   Letters from his parents reveal both frustration and hope, Fang
said.
   ``Once my father said, `I am an astronomer and I cannot see the
sky,''' he said.
   But both have continued their research with help from overseas
colleagues, and they have written 10 literary and scientific
articles that will be published in Western magazines, he said.
   ``Their spirits are strong,'' Fang said in an interview. In one
letter, he said his father wrote, ``We will create a new life no
matter how unbearable the condition is.''
   Their son said free speech is among the freedoms enshrined in the
Chinese constitution.
   ``A few people like my father dare to exercise and enjoy this
kind of freedom and rights and so are accused of being criminals.
Actually they were accused because of their conscience and
beliefs,'' he said.
   Some Chinese are displeased with Fang and Li for seeking refuge
in the embassy, and with student leaders who fled overseas. They
feel they have betrayed the Chinese people by not enduring through
the period that followed the demonstrations in Tiananmen Square.
   Fang said his parents, who have another son in China, were
reluctant to go to the embassy because they did not want to hurt the
pro-democracy movement, but they realized their lives may have been
at stake.
   Fang said he speaks for himself, not as an official spokesman for
his parents.
   ``I have the confidence, as well as my father and my mother, that
we will win eventually,'' he said.

   The Soviet Union has retracted what
appeared to be a threat by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to suspend
Jewish emigration to Israel, a senior U.S. official said today.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III told Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze at a meeting Tuesday in Copenhagen,
Denmark, he was concerned about Gorbachev's statement at the
Washington summit, the official said.
   In reply, Shevardnadze told Baker that the Soviet ``had no plan
to change their approach, they are committed to that,'' said the
official, who briefed reporters on condition that he not be
identified.
   Baker flew to Turnberry from the Danish capital, where he and
Shevardnadze attended a 35-nation human rights conference. In
Scotland, Baker is to talk with NATO ministers on the latest U.S.
and Soviet moves toward an agreement on the military future of a
reunified Germany.
   The senior U.S. official also said Shevardnadze advised Baker the
Israeli government would be informed that emigration policy was not
being altered.
   The foreign minister did not say how Moscow was informing Israel,
the official said. There are no formal relations between the two
countries but diplomats have exchanged visits.
   The senior official volunteered the account of the conversation,
held at the Soviet Embassy in Copenhagen, when he briefed reporters
aboard Baker's U.S. Air Force jet.
   Gorbachev, speaking Sunday at a joint news conference with
President Bush at the end of the four-day Washington summit, said
Israel should heed the advice of the two leaders and not settle
Soviet Jews on the occupied West Bank or in Gaza.
   ``We are facing the following situation,'' Gorbachev said.
``Either after these (summit) meetings our concern is heeded in
Israel and they will make certain conclusions or else we must give
further thought to it in terms of what we do in issuing permits for
exit.''
   Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union is at a record high.
About 20,000 permits were issued last month. The United States is
taking in about 70,000 Soviet Jews this year. Most of the others go
to Israel, where their rising numbers perturbs the Arabs.
   Also today, Baker said he would take to the NATO allies a Soviet
proposal for an agreement with the Warsaw Pact on the military
future of a reunited Germany.
   Baker said that even though Shevardnadze had provided him with
only a few details, ``I hope we are making progress'' in persuading
Moscow to give up its objections to German membership in the Western
alliance.
   ``I don't feel at liberty to get into the details,'' Baker told
reporters at a Copenhagen news conference. ``After all,'' he said,
``this is an alliance-to-alliance matter if it ever comes to
anything.''
   Baker said the Soviets wanted ``confidence-building measures'' as
part of any settlement on Germany. Other U.S. officials said the
measures under discussion also involved accelerating negotiations
for reducing non-nuclear arms in Europe.
   Before flying to Turnberry, Baker called in a speech for
strengthening the rule of law in Central European countries that are
shaking off Soviet influence.
   ``The watchword of reformers everywhere is the rule of law,''
Baker said, quoting the late Soviet dissident and Nobel laureate
Andrei Sakharov. ``Democratic change must be accomplished through
democratic methods _ peacefully, through legal processes.''
   His speech to a 35-nation human rights conference contained scant
mention of the situation in the Baltics. The Soviet republics of
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are at various stages in their quest
for independence, and are encountering stiff resistance from Moscow.
   In the address, Baker did not confront the Soviets directly but
urged them to initiate ``a systematic dialogue'' with leaders of the
independence movements ``so that the aspirations of the Baltic
peoples can be achieved.''
   On another topic, Baker offered the most optimistic U.S. forecast
yet about completing a treaty to sharply reduce U.S. and Soviet
troops, tanks, artillery and other non-nuclear weapons in Europe.
   He said that ``at the CSCE summit, we would expect to sign a CFE
agreement, and President Gorbachev last week indicated he shared
this view.''
   The French government, the host, proposed on Tuesday to hold the
summit of the 35-nation Conference on European Security and
Cooperation in Paris in December. The Bush administration has made
completion of the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty a
precondition for the event.
   Describing his talks on Germany with Shevardnadze, Baker said the
Soviet government had to develop its proposal more fully before the
Western allies could respond to it formally.
   Still, Baker said, enough had been made clear by Shevardnadze in
their two-hour meeting at the Soviet Embassy on Tuesday to know
``what they are talking about is an agreement between the Warsaw
Pact and the NATO alliance.''
   He said he hoped to have more details from Moscow at a meeting on
Germany's future planned for June 22 in Berlin. The four World War
II allies _ the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet
Unikon _ will attend along with the foreign ministers of the two
German states.

   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker
III on Wednesday presented a Soviet proposal on Germany's military
future to the 15 U.S. allies in NATO as having the potential to
break an East-West deadlock.
   ``I hope we are making progress,'' Baker said before leaving
Copenhagen, where he discussed the idea for two hours Tuesday night
with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   He then flew to this small town on the western coast of Scotland
where Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had invited the NATO foreign
ministers to meet on Germany and other East-West issues.
   Baker will see Mrs. Thatcher on Thursday and confer with the
foreign ministers through Saturday. A month from now President Bush
and the heads of the 15 governments will meet at a NATO summit in
London.
   The key issue in all these sessions is the impending union of
East Germany and West Germany, producing a powerful nation that the
allies _ and even some members of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact _ want
enrolled in NATO.
   The problem is persuading Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
to acquiesce. The Soviets are losing East Germany as a staunch ally
and buffer and will now be confronted by a country with which they
fought two world wars this century.
   Bush's prescription is to anchor Germany in NATO as a protection
against any unilateral move by the Germans.
   Baker offered Shevardnadze a nine-point package of assurances,
including a German promise not to acquire nuclear or chemical
weapons or to seek to expand its borders.
   At their meeting Tuesday night in Copenhagen the Soviet foreign
minister went into some detail about what Baker called
``confidence-building measures.''
   The Soviet idea is to have NATO and the Warsaw Pact, which begins
a meeting Thursday in Moscow, exchange political assurances.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany, who
attended a 35-nation human rights conference in Copenhagen with
Baker and Shevardnadze, said in a speech there that ``the democratic
Europe must be a Europe of tolerance.''
   He said ``ideological blindness, nationalism, racism, fascism and
anti-Semitism have caused inhuman terror and untold suffering on our
continent.''
   The foreign minister, leader of West Germany's liberal Free
Democratic party, said: ``We Germans know that we cannot cope with
our future without the will to remember the past.''
   He said Germany and all other European nations must be alert to
any hint of anti-Semitism and ``to resolutely nip any such
developments in the bud.''
   Baker told reporters he was ``not at liberty to get into the
details'' of the Soviet proposal. ``After all,'' he said, ``this is
an alliance-to-alliance matter if it ever comes to anything.''
   In his speech at the human rights conference, Baker called for
free elections and free-market economies throughout Eastern and
Central Europe.
   ``The watchword of reformers everywhere is the rule of law,'' he
said, quoting the late Soviet dissident and Nobel laureate Andrei
Sakharov. ``Democratic change must be accomplished through
democratic methods _ peacefully, through legal processes.''
   He mentioned only briefly the Baltic republics, where
independence movements are running into Soviet roadblocks.
   Baker urged Moscow to initiate ``a systematic dialogue'' with the
leaders of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania ``so that the aspirations
of the Baltic peoples can be achieved.''
   There was no hint of stronger action against Moscow, as urged by
many members of Congress.

   Democrats rallied around Harvey Gantt on
Wednesday as North Carolina's first black U.S. Senate nominee
embraced his defeated challenger and prepared to take on Republican
Sen. Jesse Helms.
   ``The Democratic Party is ready to go forward unified just like
we promised,'' Gantt told supporters at Democratic Party
headquarters after he defeated Brunswick County District Attorney
Mike Easley in Tuesday's runoff.
   He laughed and joked with Easley, saying,``He sounded exactly
like me on so many things, I wondered how I'd beat this guy.''
   But after the two exchanged congratulations on a positive,
issue-oriented campaign, talk turned to their expectations that the
gloves would come off when Helms starts throwing political punches.
   ``I think it's very important that we not allow this campaign to
drift off into those hot-button, emotional issues that I call Jesse
Helms' pasture,'' Gantt said.
   ``I'm going to talk about the issues of working families _
education for liberal and conservative families, the importance of
affordable health care, protecting the environment,'' he said. ``If
wanting to challenge North Carolinians and Americans to address
those challenges makes me a liberal, so be it.''
   Helms issued a terse statement Tuesday night congratulating Gantt
for his ``hard-fought'' victory.
   In final, unofficial returns, Gantt had 273,347 votes, or 57
percent, to Easley's 207,329, or 43 percent.

   The Soviet Union has retracted what
appeared to be a threat by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to suspend
Jewish emigration to Israel, a senior U.S. official said Wednesday.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III told Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze at a meeting Tuesday in Copenhagen,
Denmark, he was concerned by Gorbachev's statement at the Washington
summit, the official said.
   In reply, Shevardnadze told Baker Soviet officials ``had no plan
to change their approach, they are committed to that,'' the official
said on condition of annonymity. The official spoke to reporters
aboard Baker's U.S. Air Force jet.
   He said Shevardnadze told Baker that the Israeli government would
be advised that the Soviet emigration policy was not being altered.
   The foreign minister did not say how Moscow would inform Israel.
The two countries do not have formal relations, but diplomats have
exchanged visits.
   Baker flew to Turnberry, where he and Shevardnadze were to attend
a meeting of the North Atlantic Council. Both Baker and his Soviet
counterpart had been in Copenhagen for a 35-nation human rights
conference.
   Speaking at a joint news conference with President Bush at the
end of the four-day Washington summit on Sunday, Gorbachev said
Israel should not settle Soviet jews in the Israeli-occupied West
Bank or Gaza Strip.
   Bush also objected to Soviet Jews being settled in the
territories.
   Gorbachev said that if Israel did not heed the two leaders'
advice, the Soviet Union might further restrict exit permits.
   ``Either after these (summit) meetings our concern is heeded in
Israel and they will make certain conclusions, or we must give
further thought to it in terms of what we do in issuing permits for
exit,'' Gorbachev said.
   Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union is at an all-time high.
About 20,000 permits were issued last month, but an estimated 1
million Soviets are waiting to emigrate.
   The United States will take in 70,000 Soviet Jews this year and
most of the others will go to Israel. An estimated 750,000 are
expected to flood into that country in the next years.
   Arab nations have expressed concern about a possible mass
settlement of Soviet Jews in the occupied lands, captured by Israel
from the Arabs in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Gorbachev said two Arab leaders, Presidents Hosni Mubarak of
Egypt and Hafez Assad of Syria, ``raised in acute terms, the
question of Israeli guarantees now.''
   Israeli officials say only about 200 Soviet Jews have settled in
the territories, home to 1.7 million Palestinians and 70,000 Jewish
settlers.
   Israeli Minister of Immigrant Absorption Yitzhak Peretz has
denied Israel is settling immigrants there.

   The United States and its NATO allies
are considering the increased use of multinational military units as
a way of making Western troops more acceptable in a unified Germany,
analysts say.
   Richard Fieldhouse, senior research associate at the Natural
Resources Defense Council in Washington, described the push for
forces with soldiers from many nations as ``an attempt to maintain
some sort of NATO forces within Germany.''
   ``All of this comes out of the desire to present stationed forces
in a way which is more palatable to Germany and the Soviet Union,''
said Hans Binnendijk, director of studies at the International
Institute for Strategic Studies in London.
   The idea of multinational forces got a boost last month when U.S.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and other defense chiefs of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization called for an alliance study of their
use. They said in a final statement that they attached ``particular
importance'' to the task.
   Multinational forces _ air, sea or ground units carrying the
flags of a variety of nations _ are nothing new to NATO.
   But the new attention reflects the alliance's campaign to revamp
its military strategy with the diminished threat from the Soviet-led
Warsaw Pact.
   Moreover, it must deal with the prospects of a unified Germany.
West Germany belongs to NATO, but its eastern neighbor is part of
the crumbling Warsaw Pact.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union has opposed
NATO membership for a united Germany. He recently suggested it could
remain in the Western alliance but must withdraw from its integrated
military structure. France and Spain, both NATO allies, are outside
the joint military command.
   In the changing situation, Fieldhouse said it would be difficult
for the United States to make a case for keeping a large contingent
of troops in Germany. ``What role does the United States have as a
NATO nation in Germany?'' he asked.
   Binnendijk said West Germans doesn't want to be different from
their European neighbors. ``Stationed forces make them abnormal,''
he said.
   As a result, Fieldhouse predicted, ``Germans probably won't be
interested in having 195,000 Americans stationed on their soil in a
relatively short period of time.''
   The United States has an estimated 239,000 soldiers in West
Germany, and the Soviet Union has 380,000 Red Army troops on East
German soil.
   Washington and Moscow have settled on a plan, as part of arms
control talks in Vienna, that would reduce their forces stationed in
Central Europe to 195,000 soldiers on each side. The United States
would maintain an additional 30,000 troops in Britain and southern
Europe.
   Fieldhouse also argued that the continued presence of NATO troops
in Germany would enable its allies to ``keep some form of influence
in German affairs.''
   ``This would be perhaps one answer to any German interest in
building up a military,'' he said. Some in Europe worry about the
resurgence of a militaristic Germany in the strategic center of
their continent.
   U.S. Gen. John Galvin, the supreme commander of alliance forces
in Europe, said NATO's air and sea forces already are made up of
units from various nations.
   ``It is really only the ground forces that are somewhat lacking
in multinationality,'' he said in a recent interview.
   Galvin suggested it might be best to form multinational ground
units at the corps level. A corps is usually made up of three
divisions of 15,000 to 20,000 soldiers each. Each division would be
drawn from a different nation.
   He said he was concerned a smaller unit would be inefficient.
``There is a certain level at which multinationality begins not to
work very well,' he said.
   He said it was difficult, for instance, to have a multinational
crew in an airplane partly because of differences in language and
training. ``It's hard to change that in an aircraft where you need
to be in constant communication making quick decisions,'' he said.
   In 1960, NATO formed the ACE Mobile Force, which draws air and
ground troops from Belgium, Canada, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Britain and the United States. Their mission is to
respond rapidly in an emergency.
   There are about 5,000 soldiers in the land unit and two to four
squadrons, with about 20 or so planes in each squadron, in the air
force.
   Last year, the NATO Composite Force was created to react quickly
to an attack in northern Norway. It is made up of troops from
Canada, West Germany, Norway and the United States.

<TEXT>
   For Sale: Stately 72-room, 87-year-old home
featuring an indoor swimming pool and bowling alley. Asking price:
$6 million. Historical significance: Once home to Hugh Hefner and a
brood of Playboy bunnies.
   It's been an art school dormitory for the last five years, but
the original Playboy Mansion is remembered more for scantily-clad
women and it's robed, pipe-smoking lord and master than dorm keggers
and food fights.
   The mansion is being sold by the School of the Art Institute in
Chicago. The Chicago-based Playboy Enterprises Inc. donated use of
the building to the school in 1984.
   Playboy officials promised the school title to the property if it
was maintained for five years. School officials received the deed in
February, but said the building was too expensive to maintain as a
dormitory.
   Hefner, Playboy's founder, bought the mansion in 1959 and lived
there until 1971, when he moved to a palatial mansion in Los Angeles.
   University real estate officials said they have received numerous
proposals for the property, including one to convert it into luxury
condominiums.

   Move over, Johnny and Dave. Arsenio is the
fairest in late-night TV talk show land these days. At least that's
how US magazine readers see it.
   US magazine's third annual readers' poll, which surveyed 3,600
people, showed its readers to be a fickle lot.
   Just last year, they chose Roseanne Barr as the best TV actress,
but this year she was named worst TV actress. She also was named
``most overexposed actress'' and her show, ``Roseanne,'' was ``the
worst TV series.''
   On the other hand, they love ``Roseanne'' co-star John Goodman,
although not his fashion sense. He was named ``best TV actor'' and
``worst dressed actor'' by readers responding to a ballot published
in the March 5 issue.
   Other picks:
   Best movie actor: Tom Cruise. Worst: Sylvester Stallone.
   Best movie actress: Bette Midler. Worst: Madonna.
   Hottest New Actress: Julia Roberts of ``Pretty Woman.''
   Hottest New Actor: Richard Grieco, star of TV's ``Booker.''
   Best Movie: ``Born on the Fourth of July.'' Worst: ``Batman.''
   Best TV actor: John Goodman. Worst: Bill Cosby.
   Best TV actress: Candice Bergen. Worst: Roseanne Barr.
   Entertainer of the Year and best late night talk show host:
Arsenio Hall.
   Best Musical Group: New Kids On The Block. Worst: Guns N' Roses.
   Best male singer: Richard Marx. Worst: Prince.
   Best female singer: Paula Abdul (who also won best hairdo
honors). Worst: Madonna.
   And in the ``make up your mind'' category, readers chose Michael
Douglas and Kathleen Turner as this year's best movie couple and

   Country music giants Randy Travis,
Loretta Lynn and Clint Black helped lure about 20,000 people eager
for a chance to rub elbows with stars to the 19th annual
International Country Music Fan Fair.
   Travis attracted one of the largest crowds Tuesday afternoon,
with people lined up around a building to take a picture with the
singing star, get an autograph or simply shake hands.
   Cameras clicked furiously and the crowd oohed and aahed when a
youngster in full cowboy regalia was lifted onto a counter next to
Black.
   Zachary Bingham will be 3 this month and is a big country music
fan already, says his mother, Sonja Bingham.
   ``His favorite song is (Black's) `Nobody's Home' and he puts on
his boots and his hat along with the words,'' Mrs. Bingham said.
   Charley Pride also was a hit at the celebrity show-off event at
the Tennessee State Fairgrounds.
   Beside star contact, the weeklong fair's $70 registration fee
lets fans see 40 hours of concerts, visit the Opryland USA showpark
and tour the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum.
   More than 24,000 people registered for the fan festival, said
Country Music Association spokeswoman Kelly Gattis.

   A concert pavilion is the latest to ban
concerts by the Grateful Dead because of its fans.
   Merriweather Post Pavilion granted a police request to end
scheduling of concerts by the veteran rock 'n' roll band and the
Jerry Garcia Band, headed by the Grateful Dead's lead singer, said
Jean Parker, general manager of the 14,000-seat amphitheater.
   Grateful Dead spokesman Dennis McNally dismissed the pavilion's
decision, saying drug arrests at concerts reflect a problem in
society and should not be blamed on the bands.
   ``The same arrests are made at football games and baseball
games,'' McNally said.
   In California, Stanford University and the University of
California, Berkeley banned the group in April because of recurring
drug-related arrests at concerts.
   The San Francisco-based band, which formed in the 1960s, has a
large following of so-called Dead Heads. Many have followed the band
from show to show, peddling T-shirts and other Grateful Dead
souvenirs.
   Hoping to boost its image, the band recently banned all vending
outside their concerts.

<TEXT>
   Democratic Leader George Mitchell said
Wednesday an anticrime bill curbing semiautomatic weapons could be
scuttled unless senators put a time limit on debate this week.
   ``This is the vote on the crime bill,'' Mitchell said as senators
prepared for a vote Thursday to limit debate to 30 hours.
   Sponsors of the bill have been saying that, without the time
limit, debating more than 241 proposed amendments would mean
open-ended delays and make it impossible to vote on the overall
legislation.
   The bill would bar the import or domestic manufacture of nine
semiautomatic assault rifles, pistols and shotguns.
   It also would provide for the death penalty for 30 federal
crimes, allow courts to consider evidence gathered with faulty
warrants in some cases and move to end decade-long delays in
carrying out death sentences.
   Mitchell was asked what would happen if the Senate on Thursday
balked at a time limit on debate. ``That's it,'' the Maine senator
said sharply. He suggested that the Senate would then move on to
other business and not return to the measure.
   The campaign against military-looking semiautomatic weapons began
in January 1989 after a deranged man with an AK-47 rifle opened fire
on a Stockton, Calif., school yard, leaving five dead and 30 injured.
   The National Rifle Association has been against the plan, saying
that the ``assault weapons'' that would be restricted differ only in
appearance from ordinary semiautomatic hunting rifles with their
traditional brown wood stocks. It says the bill would be unfair to
hunters, gun collectors and target shooters.
   After senators rebuffed the NRA two weeks ago and refused to drop
the curbs, lawmakers introduced scores of amendments.
   But the Senate on Tuesday voted 54-37 in favor of invoking
cloture, or imposing a time limit, six votes short of the 60 needed.
   The Senate shelved further action on the crime package until
after the Thursday vote.
   Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., said on the floor Wednesday that he
``can't understand why the crime package is being put off.'' He said
lawmakers had introduced ``some very good amendments to this issue.''
   ``The American people feel very strongly that the scales have
tipped too much in favor of the criminals and against the victims
and against the rights of society,'' Lott said.
   He said there was ``nobody who is trying to delay this issue just
because of the gun-control question.''
   ``Let's don't invoke cloture on Thursday, let's deal with these
important amendments,'' Lott said. He said Americans ``don't
understand parliamentary maneuver that prohibits amendments that are
very important to them and should be on it.''

   President Bush pressed Greek Premier
Constantine Mitsotakis today for extradition of a Palestinian wanted
for the 1982 bombing of a Pan Am plane over Hawaii.
   The new conservative Greek leader, the first to visit the White
House in 26 years, urged Bush to prod Turkey to withdraw troops from
Cyprus.
   Mitsokakis, after talks in the Oval Office and a luncheon in
Bush's residence, told reporters, ``I think I was pretty convincing
when I told the president that both as a human being and as a
politician I will do my very best to combat terrorism.''
   Mitsokakis' son-in-law, Pavlos Bakoyannis, a member of
parliament, was assassinated on an Athens street by terrorists last
September. His widow, Dora, who subsequently won his seat in
parliament, accompanied her father to the White House.
   On the U.S. extradition request for Mohammed Rashid, wanted for a
1982 jet bombing that killed a Japanese teen-ager and wounded 15
others, Mitsotakis said he told Bush, ``we're looking into it and we
will decide before September.''
   The Greek Supreme Court has upheld a lower court's extradition
order. The decision now rests with the country's minister of
justice. Rashid was arrested at the Athens airport in May 1988 on a
fake passport.
   On the subject of Cyprus, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said Bush ``made clear that the status quo on the island is not
satisfactory and that the United States is committed to active
suport for the (United Nations) secretary general's efforts to
achieve'' a settlement.
   Asked about the possibility of an American initiative to break
the deadlock, Fitzwater said the United States believes ``the best
course of doing that is within the U.N.''
   Fitzwater said the two leaders agreed on the importance of
international cooperation in fighting terrorism and narcotics.
   Mitsotakis told The Washington Post beforehand that he would urge
Bush to prod the Turkish government to cut its occupation forces in
half on Cyprus.
   The island has been partitioned since a 1974 Turkish invasion.
   Mitsotakis told reporters on the White House driveway, ``I asked
him to use all his influence in order to help settle the Cyprus
issue. I told him that presently we are at a dead end and some
gesture, acting like a catalyst, should be made from the Turkish
side.''
   He said he felt Bush was ``highly interested in the matter.''
   The United States often had strained ties with Mitsotakis'
socialist predecesor, Andreas Papandreou, during his eight-year
ternure.
   In the two months since Mitsotakis' New Democracy Party took
power, Greece and the United States have already initialed a new
defense agreement.
   Fitzwater said, ``The two presidents agreed that this visit was
important for a new beginning of an old friendship.''
   Mitsotakis said it ``inaugurates a new period of relations
between the two countries.''
   He said Bush had accepted an invitation to visit Greece, and
invited Mitsotakis back to Washington for an official visit. No
dates were set.
   A base agreement initialed after just two rounds of talks will
allow the U.S. military presence in Greece to continue. But two of
the four U.S. bases in Greece _ Hellenikon Air Force Base near
Athens and a naval communications station _ will be closed.
   Mitsotakis's New Democracy Party has 150 seats in the 300-member
Parliament. One deputy who represents a small conservative grouping
is backing Mitsotakis' party.
   The terms of the agreement will be made public once mutually
acceptable translations are completed. Formal signing is expected in
July.
   During the Papandreou government, the two sides were unable to
conclude a base agreement despite 17 rounds of negotiations.
   As a NATO ally, Greece is slated to receive $345 million in
military aid during the next fiscal year.

   Jane Pauley still insists NBC was not trying to
force her out by bringing Deborah Norville aboard ``Today'' but her
husband, ``Doonesbury'' cartoonist Garry Trudeau, wasn't so sure.
   ``His initial reaction to NBC's handling of the whole thing was
`slash and burn,''' Pauley said in an interview in July's issue of
Ladies' Home Journal. ``I remember him telling someone that most
people in my position would have left tire tracks on Deborah's
back.''
   But not Jane. In fact she says she admires the way Norville has
handled all the negative publicity. ``If it had been me getting all
that criticism, I would not have been functioning professionally. I
probably wouldn't have wanted to show my face.''
   Pauley says she loves what she's doing now, substituting for Tom
Brokaw and developing prime-time specials, but loves getting to
spend time with her three children, twins Ross and Rachel, 6, and
Thomas, 3, even more.
   ``If I stayed on the show,'' she said, ``I knew I would have less
time with the twins because they were in school. I didn't feel
they'd hold their mother personally accountable for not being there
... but I felt guilty because I didn't have the time and,
increasingly, the energy to give to them.''
   One of the first things she discovered when she stopped doing
``Today'' was that her kids never tuned in to see mommy on TV;
``They watch Gumby and Bugs Bunny.''

   Each school should be able to structure its own
program because student achievement is being stifled by
``heavy-handed politics and high-handed bureaucracy,'' said a study
released Wednesday.
   John Chubb, a senior fellow at Brookings Institution, and
Stanford University political scientist Terry Moe said in the study
that states should provide the schools with tax-funded scholarships
for every eligible student enrolled.
   Parents and students, they said, then would be free to select
either public or private schools in any district.
   ``We found that America's current system of public education
stifles student achievement because of heavy-handed politics and
high-handed bureaucracy,'' Chubb said.
   School performance, he said, is unrelated to how much is spent on
each student, teacher salaries, class size and graduation
requirements _ ``the very things the government has worked for 30
years to change.''
   However, California Schools Superintendent Bill Honig responded
to the study by saying that improvements have been made in student
achievement _ especially when educators use a comprehensive approach
that includes strengthening the curriculum and teaching material,
improving teacher salaries and training, and giving principals more
control.
   Honig called the scholarship idea a voucher system that will
isolate poor and minority children, and will cost more because
parents now paying for private-school education will be subsidized
by the government.
   Chubb and Moe spent 10 years studying American high schools,
using surveys of more than 20,000 principals, teachers and students
at about 500 high schools nationwide. It is considered the largest
survey of its kind ever conducted.
   According to the study, ``Politics, Markets, and America's
Schools,'' an average student at an effective school has a 52
percent chance of taking an academic program of study, while that
same student has only half that chance at an ineffective schools.
   Effective schools, according to the study, have 20 percent to 50
percent less interference from superintendents and central offices
in matters related to curriculum, instruction, hiring, firing and
discipline.
   Acknowledging that their proposals are controversial, the authors
included reports on successful experiments with public school choice
in Minnesota, and in school districts in East Harlem, New York and
Cambridge, Mass.
   Schools can improve only if given the freedom and incentives to
organize more effectively, Chubb said.
   ``Let the people who are in the best position to know what is
good for students _ parents, teachers and principals _ make the key
decisions and let competition hold them accountable,'' he said.
   Under the Chubb-Moe plan, each school would be given sole
authority to determine its own governing structure, and the state
could not dictate a school's internal organization.
   Gary Watts of the National Education Association called the
proposal impractical.
   ``The lawsuits alone could keep an army of lawyers busy for
years'' tackling such questions as: ``Who owns school buildings,
what if a private entrepreneur takes over a school or what if one
school only wants a high quality football team'' he said.

   Presbyterians aimed for unity by promoting
harmony during their 202nd General Assembly, which ended Wednesday.
   Newly elected Moderator Price Henderson Gwynn III of Charlotte,
N.C., set the tone for the meeting of the Presbyterian Church
(U.S.A.), saying the church can reverse its membership slide of the
last quarter-century as long as members stop fighting each other.
   ``If we shoot ourselves in the foot because of internecine
warfare or denominational myopia, we are going to have to answer for
it,'' he said.
   The 2.9 million-member denomination has lost a third of its
members since the mid-1960s.
   The more than 600 commissioners to the annual meeting
overwhelmingly approved a new statement of faith, postponed action
on altering church stands on abortion and homosexuality and agreed
to explore further relations with the Mormon Church.
   In the land where Brigham Young established the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints, the assembly approved the
denomination's first statement of faith since a 1983 merger healed a
Civil-War era split over slavery.
   The document, which mixes traditional Christian beliefs with
environmental concerns and images of God as both father and mother,
will be sent to the denomination's 177 presbyteries.
   If the confession is approved by two-thirds of the regional
groups and by the 1991 General Assembly, it will become the 11th
statement of faith in the denomination's Book of Confessions.
   While noting the discrimination faced by non-Mormons in Utah, the
assembly also accepted a report calling for opening up an informal
dialogue with the Mormon Church.
   Several resolutions relating to abortion and homosexuality were
postponed until 1991, when a special Task Force on Human Sexuality
is scheduled to make its report. The denomination supports legalized
abortion, and opposes the ordination of homosexuals.
   ``They seem to be bending over backwards to be kind to one
another and avoid controversial issues,'' Parker T. Williamson of
The Presbyterian Layman said after the votes to defer action.
   But in a move criticized by several commissioners as avoiding
dispute at the price of suppressing dissent, the assembly voted to
take away semi-official church status from 21 Presbyterian
organizations, including some of the denomination's staunchest
liberal and conservative critics.
   The discussion was sparked by an uproar caused last summer when
Presbyterians for Lesbian-Gay Concerns distributed sexually explicit
pamphlets to high school and college youths at a church meeting.
   The assembly vote, which still must be approved by a majority of
the regional presbyteries, would take away the right to be
officially represented at church meeting from not only the
homosexual caucus but other liberal groups such as The Witherspoon
Society and conservative groups such as the Presbyterian Lay
Committee and Presbyterians Pro-Life.

   Alabama voters overwhelmingly ratified a
constitutional amendment making English the state's ``official
language.''
   Similar measures have been passed in at least 17 other states,
although an English-only measure in Arizona was overturned by a
judge in Feburary. A critic of Alabama's law predicted Wednesday
that it suffer the same fate, but supporters said they weren't
worried about lawsuits.
   The measure was favored by nearly 90 percent of the voters. Tom
Doron of Birmingham, director of the Alabama English Committee, said
no other state has passed an English language measure by such a wide
margin.
   The amendment states that the Legislature shall ``enforce this
amendment by appropriate legislation,'' but does not spell out what
might constitute a violation or what forms of English are acceptable.
   Doron said there are few non-English speakers in Alabama, anyway.

   Supporters hope City Hall will be reformed by
a comprehensive measure approved by voters to reduce the influence
of special interests by limiting outside income, gifts and
honorariums that some elected officials can accept.
   A key provision provides public matching funds to politicians who
restrict spending to specified levels. Its seeds were planted more
than a year ago after questions were raised about income Mayor Tom
Bradley received from two local banks.
   With all but two precincts counted, the measure had 204,573
votes, or more than 56 percent of the total cast.

   Supporters of an advisory measure to fight
AIDS by legalizing hypodermic needles promised Wednesday to
immediately draft a letter to state legislators after voters
approved the ballot item.
   San Francisco voters approved the ``Clean Needle'' measure by a
54-to-46 percent margin. It asks lawmakers to eliminate criminal and
civil penalties on the manufacture, use, sale and distribution of
needles.
   Although the measure was intended by supporters to fight the
spread of AIDS, the proposition lacked the backing of major AIDS
activists. Critics said it lacked the support of a comprehensive
public health program.

<HEAD>Unification Fears Grip Small East German Businesses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK FRITZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Groups representing thousands of small East
German businesses said on Wednesday that the terms of German
unification will force them to lay off 350,000 workers this summer.
   Klaus Noack, leader of an independent business association, said
half of the nation's 500,000 small and medium-sized businesses may
have to declare bankruptcy this year.
   Noack and two other groups, the Chamber of Commerce and the
Entrepreneur's Association, said they would call a ``warning
strike'' on the Baltic Sea island of Ruegen on Tuesday and a
nationwide strike the next day unless Parliament acted on their
demands.
   The main complaint is a key provision of an economic treaty under
which East Germany and West Germany are to merge their economies on
July 2, the principal stage of full unification.
   The treaty, which still must be ratified by both parliaments,
calls for East Germany's essentially worthless currency to be
replaced by the powerful West German mark.
   Workers will have their wages converted to West German marks at
an equal 1-1 exchange. But business bank accounts will be converted
at a 2-1 rate, in effect halving their cash reserves in relation to
their employee payrolls.
   Noack said that will force perhaps half of the small and
medium-sized businesses to file for bankruptcy and immediately
eliminate 350,000 jobs.
   He claimed the treaty would eventually threaten almost 3 million
of East Germany's 10 million workers.
   The business groups said at a news conference that they also need
the property on which their businesses stand to be protected from
Western investers.
   The German governments are still negotiating how to transfer the
vast publicly owned property in the country to the private sector.
Many East Germans fear that West Germans will buy up their property.
   Noack said the businesses need their property to use as
collateral to obtain loans to keep operating and become competitive
with Western firms already selling their products in East Germany.
   Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere's Cabinet met on Wednesday and
endorsed a plan to promote small businesses that includes extending
credit to them, said spokesman Klaus-Peter Bigalke. But he said
there were no details worked out.
   Analysts say that between 500,000 and 4 million East Germans will
lose their jobs as outmoded, overstaffed factories and other
businesses are forced to compete with Western businesses.
   East German Labor Minister Regine Hildebrandt said Wednesday that
she expected 1 million to lose their jobs.
   Much of the unemployment is expected to hit the vast industrial
sector, where the huge state-run factories, many of which are
considered environmental hazards, are expected to lure little
private investment or be able to compete with leaner Western
industries.
   Both German governments are counting on Western investment to
create new jobs in East Germany and alleviate the initial effects of
the country's move to a free market.

<HEAD>Roh Says Gorbachev Will `Melt Down the Ice' of Korean Cold War</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korean President Roh Tae-woo, reporting
at the White House on groundbreaking talks with Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, said Wednesday that the Soviet president had agreed to
help ``melt down the ice'' from the Cold War on the troubled Korean
peninsula.
   After briefing President Bush, Roh said his talks with Gorbachev
``definitely ... will help'' reduce tensions between North and South
Korea and ``help greatly the process of reunification.''
   Bush said Roh's meeting with Gorbachev was ``very appropriate''
and ``very important.''
   If a peace settlement is reached with communist North Korea, Roh
told reporters later, ``we can talk about further reductions or
reallocation'' of the 40,000 American troops stationed in South
Korea.
   Roh met with Gorbachev in San Francisco on Monday as the Soviet
leader wrapped up a six-day visit in the United States. It was the
first high-level encounter between the two nations since Korea was
divided after World War II.
   The administration hopes that without the unswerving support of
Moscow, North Korea will be inclined to seek friendlier ties with
South Korea and the industrialized West.
   However, the White House said there was no warming in U.S. ties
with North Korea along the lines of improved relations between Seoul
and Moscow.
   ``We have always indicated a willingness to improve relations
with North Korea but we have not seen any reciprocal response on
their part,'' White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said.
``At this point, I can't report any movement.''
   Roh, talking with reporters outside the White House, said he had
sought Gorbachev's help in bringing North Korea closer to South
Korea.
   The South Korean leader said they had agreed that ``we have to
cooperate so that we can melt down the ice which still exists from
the Cold War years.''
   Asked about prospects for reunification, Roh said North Korea
must first open up and embark on a reform process.
   He said Gorbachev ``agreed to combine efforts along that line.''
   The South Korean leader's meeting with Gorbachev occurred just
three weeks short of the 40th anniversary of the outbreak of the
Korean War, in which Moscow was the major arms supplier of North
Korea while Washington played the same role for South Korea.
   The weapons deliveries by the two superpowers have continued
unabated ever since.
   Relations between Moscow and Seoul hit a low point seven years
ago when a Soviet warplane shot down a Korean commercial airliner
that had strayed over Soviet territory. All 269 people aboard were
killed.

<BYLINE>Church Groups Hail Court's Equal Access Approval
^By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A wide cross-section of American churches have
praised the U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing high school
religious clubs, saying it checks discrimination against religion.
   The reactions came from mainline and evangelical denominations,
Protestants, Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholics. However, Jewish
groups demurred.
   ``Millions of American students are the real winners in this
case,'' a coalition of Protestants said Tuesday. ``They now can
claim the right of equal access for their religious, political and
philosophical speech.''
   The decision Monday upholds equal rights of students to form
religion clubs if any kind of extracurricular clubs are allowed.
Congress in 1984 called for such equal access but many schools
circumvented it.
   Commenting on the court's decision, the Protestant organizations
said it helps corrects ``an almost paranoid fear of faith'' shown by
some schools, and added:
   ``Some school districts have gone so far as to single out student
religious groups for discriminatory treatment by telling them that
they alone cannot hold on-campus meetings before or after school.''
   But the court decision makes clear that such a policy ``violates
federal law'' and the decision also ``restores a proper balance''
between church-state separation and guarantees of free exercise of
religion, the organizations said.
   They included the National Council of Churches, embracing
mainline denominations, the National Association of Evangelicals,
the Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs, and the Christian
Legal Society.
   The U.S. Catholic Conference on Wednesday joined Protestants in
hailing the decision, saying that it modified ``a trend toward
exclusion of religion from the public schools.''
   The American Jewish Congress called the decision ``regrettable.''
   ``The decision will open up the nation's public high schools to
proselytizing from organized student religion clubs,'' and create
``religious divisiveness,'' said AJC president Robert K. Lifton.

   Cash-strapped Democrats Dianne Feinstein and Harvey Gantt had
little time Wednesday to savor primary victories as they plunged
into campaigns against well-financed Republicans.
   The Democratic Party chairman conceded the money advantage but
proclaimed ``issues are going to prevail'' in November.
   Sen. Pete Wilson, sitting on a $3.5 million campaign war chest
after coasting to victory in the Republican primary for governor of
California, welcomed Feinstein to the fray and warned that her
election night celebration would be ``your last victory party of the
1990s.''
   Feinstein, who quickly won a pledge of support from her defeated
primary rival, said she was optimistic about the fall: ``We do have
a united Democratic Party that's now able to appeal to the
independents and the Republicans.''
   North Carolina Democrats gave Gantt, the black former mayor of
Charlotte, a strong sendoff into a Senate challenge to conservative
Republican Jesse Helms. Regarded as the underdog in the Democratic
primary runoff, Gantt picked up 57 percent of the vote to roll over
prosecutor Mike Easley.
   ``You're talking about a newly awakened voter in North
Carolina,'' said national Democratic Party Chairman Ronald H. Brown.
``You're talking about a candidate who has touched some chords
there.''
   While candidates who competed in primaries in nine states
celebrated their victories or licked their wounds, much of the
post-election attention centered not on a candidate but on voter
approval of a California ballot initiative that will double the
state gasoline tax over the next five years.
   Supporters as well as some opponents of the ballot proposition
touted the vote as the end of the tax revolt that began in 1978 when
California voters passed Proposition 13 that cut property taxes in
half and put a lid on future increases.
   ``It really does end the tax revolt in California and sends a
message to Washington which I dislike intensely,'' said anti-tax
economist Arthur Laffer.
   Brown was more cautious.
   ``I'm not sure we ought to read too much into it,'' he said of
the California tax vote. ``Folks are saying we want a cleaner
environment and do something about gridlock on the freeways.''
   But the Democratic chairman was celebrating the decisive defeat
of two Republican-sponsored California ballot initiatives that would
have stripped the state legislature of most of its power to redraw
political boundaries to conform to the 1990 Census. The Democrats
control both chambers of the California Legislature.
   Incumbents were uniformly successful on Tuesday, including seven
senators, four governors, and all House members who sought
renomination. The success stories included Rep. Jim Bates of
California, who survived a Democratic primary challenge despite
having been rebuked by the House Ethics Committee for sexual
harassment of women employees.
   One race that remained to be decided was in Alabama, where
teachers union official Paul Hubbert and attorney general Don
Siegelman will clash in a June 26 runoff for the Democratic
nomination to oppose Republican Gov. Guy Hunt.
   While Wilson was expected to raise and spend up to $20 million in
an effort to keep the California governor's office in Republican
control, Feinstein emerged from her bruising primary against
Attorney General John Van de Kamp with an empty campaign treasury.
   The former San Francisco mayor spent about $6 million in the
primary, including $3 million she and Richard Blum, her investment
banker husband poured into the campaign.
   Gantt will be up against a conservative senator with one of the
nation's most successful fund-raising networks. Helms spent $17
million on his 1984 re-election campaign.
   ``They are going to have a money advantage,'' said Brown of the
Republicans. ``The issues are going to prevail,'' he added.
   At a rally in Raleigh, N.C., Gantt challenged Helms to join him
in joint appearances at every courthouse in the state to campaign
``the old-fashioned way.''
   ``I hope we don't get into those obscene amounts of money we saw
in 1984,'' said the Democratic candidate.
   Gantt lost no time focusing on the issues he felt would work
against Helms _ education, the environment and abortion.
   ``We have a senator in Washington who just hasn't been paying
attention, who hasn't been paying attention to the problem of our
young people's education in this state,'' Gantt said.
   Gantt drew a clear contrast to Helms' opposition to abortion.
``It's not the business of government to interfere with a woman's
right to choose,'' he said, staking out a position parallel to that
taken last year by fellow Democrat L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia
when he became the first black elected governor of any state.

   They don't look back with bitterness. But
people who lived through pivotal civil rights battlefields of the
1950s reunited this week and said the nation still hasn't conquered
racism.
   ``After 36 years, to me it's very disheartening to see that the
struggle continues,'' said Linda Brown Buckner, who as a child had
to walk across town, past white schools, to a attend one of Topeka's
black schools.
   Her name went on the lawsuit that prompted the U.S. Supreme Court
to rule in 1954 that segregated schools were unconstitutional.
   Brown appeared Tuesday on a panel that discussed the 1954 case.
The event was part of a conference on President Eisenhower's role in
the civil rights movement.
   Brown noted that the Brown vs. Topeka Board of Education lawsuit
still isn't resolved. It was reopened 11 years ago, and federal
courts have ruled that the board still hasn't removed a pattern of
unequal schools.
   ``I think the vestiges of segregation are alive and well. All you
have to do is look at Topeka to see that the east side is mainly
black and the west side is mainly white,'' she said.
   Former Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus, who in 1957 used the National
Guard to block nine black children from a Little Rock high school,
also appeared on a panel with four of those students.
   Eisenhower drew international attention to race relations in the
South by sending the 101st Airborne Division into Little Rock so the
nine could attend Central High.
   The conference was at Eisenhower's presidential library in this
east-central Kansas town of Abilene, which he called home.
   Hugh Speer, a key plaintiff witness in the Brown case, criticized
the current Topeka Board of Education for continuing to fight court
orders to desegregate.
   ``The big question is whether Topeka has lived up to the 1954
decision when they still have three or four schools that are
predominantly minority,'' Speer said.
   He said the board was spending more on appealing the reopened
case to the U.S. Supreme Court than it would cost to simply comply
with the integration orders. The high court has yet to decide
whether to hear the reopened case.
   The Little Rock panelists, some of them meeting Faubus for the
first time, agreed that racism was far from solved.
   ``We have to remove our own cases of apartheid,'' said Ernest
Green.
   Faubus, 80, defended his action aimed at blocking implementation
of the Brown case.
   ``It was my responsibility to maintain order as much as possible
and see that no one was injured and there was no property damage,''
he said. ``We came out all right. We're all here.''

   Switzerland wants to join the 152 countries in
the International Monetary Fund, which plays a key role in the
world's financial system, fund officials said Wednesday.
   Switzerland, concerned for its traditional neutrality, has been
reluctant to join international organizations. In 1982, a government
plan to join the fund was postponed after a Swiss voters defeated a
proposal to join the United Nations.
   However, the Swiss government has had close informal relations
with the fund.
   The fund's Board of Directors will consider the application, and
a fund spokesman said formalities could be completed by the end of
the year.
   All members of the fund also join its sister organization, the
World Bank, the biggest source of loans to the Third World.
   Applications also are pending from Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria;
China, Poland, Hungary and Romania already are members.
   The Soviet Union has said it would like to join, but the Bush
administration has objected.

<TEXT>
   Ethnic violence that has left at least 35 people
dead in the republic of Kirghizia spread on Wednesday, with gangs of
youths marauding on horseback and authorities reported helpless
against rioters.
   Anatoly Lukyanov, chairman of the national legislature, told
lawmakers on Wednesday that ``nearly 40'' people died in rioting in
the Central Asian republic. The official Tass news agency put the
death toll at 35, and about 300 have been reported injured in
clashes between ethnic Uzbeks and Kirghiz.
   The unrest, triggered by a land dispute, was the latest in a
series of ethnic outbreaks fueled by poverty or political conflict
to trouble the government of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The violence in Kirghizia spread on Wednesday to the republic's
capital, Frunze, when a rally turned into a riot, and protesters
pelted with stones a Communist Party official who tried to speak to
the crowd, Tass reported.
   ``There are cases of marauding, robbery and violence,'' it said.
   Several Uzbeks were beaten in the Frunze marketplace, and Uzbek
students were evacuated from the city's university to a nearby
military unit to prevent clashes.
   At the rally, ``speakers called upon the crowd to start pogroms
of the Uzbek residents' homes and flats,'' city Communist Party
official Ivan Pavlov said in a telephone interview. He said rioters
``jumped on a man who looked like an Uzbek and started beating him
savagely.''
   In the city of Osh, 75 miles east of Frunze, where the violence
broke out Monday night between the two predominantly Moslem ethnic
groups, ``The situation is complicated by numerous groups of Kirghiz
youths on horseback converging on the city,'' the government
newspaper Izvestia reported.
   ``Local organs of power, including the local party committee,
have not managed to take control of the situation and are in a state
of disarray,'' it said.
   Police fired on Kirghiz and Uzbeks trying to storm police
stations on Tuesday in and around Osh, according to Tass. The city
is in the densely populated western part of Kirghizia on the border
with Uzbekistan.
   Soviet media, including the TV news program ``Vremya,'' Wednesday
blamed the violence on widespread unemployment among youth in the
region and general poverty. Housing is also critically short in
Soviet Central Asia, and the land dispute centered on plots where
individual houses could be built.
   Lukyanov, speaking Wednesday to the Supreme Soviet, said: ``The
difficult process of regulating the conflict is going on.'' He asked
deputies from the republics of Kirghizia and Uzbekistan to appeal
for calm.
   He said 21 law officers were among the casualties, but did not
give a breakdown of dead and injured.
   Ethnic Uzbeks from the Fergana Valley of Uzbekistan had arrived
in the area to join their comrades in the fight, Lukyanov said,
adding that the Soviet Defense Ministry dispatched reinforcements
from the republic of Turkmenia to the Osh area.
   Clashes also were reported in the nearby town of Uzgen, where six
deaths and 18 injuries occurred. Police in Frunze also were placed
on alert.
   A duty officer of the Osh police said in a telephone interview
that a majority of shops and factories reopened Wednesday after
being shut down on Tuesday. He refused to give his name.
   Tass reported that helicopters hovered over Osh and armored
personnel carriers rolled through the streets of the city of 210,000
people. A state of emergency and a 10 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew remained
in effect in the region.
   Tass reported that police and Interior Ministry troops set up
roadblocks and restricted entry to Osh. The Soviet army newspaper
Red Star reported that the only enterprise that stayed open Tuesday
in Osh was a large bakery.
   In Uzgen, 35 miles from Osh, deaths and injuries occurred when
the district police headquarters was attacked, the newspaper said.
   Lukyanov said the dispute was triggered by the ownership of 80
acres of fallow land. But Baktiyor Hamidov, head of the economic
department of Uzbekistan's mission in Moscow, said in an interview
that there is much more land at issue. He said 618,000 acres of
cotton fields near the border are being made available by the Uzbek
government and local Kirghiz authorities are controlling it.
   ``They began dividing it between the families'' of mostly Kirghiz
descent, he said, and the Uzbeks demanded it be divided evenly.
   Hamidov said the region was among the nation's most densely
populated, with 500 to 1,125 people per square mile. He said
disputes over land have their roots dating back to 1924, when
traditional boundaries were blurred by Stalin.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British woman and her GI sweetheart, who married
45 years after meeting in war-time Britain, say they are being kept
apart again by American red tape.
   ``If I could hire a dinghy boat, I would row the Atlantic to get
back. That's how I feel,'' Millicent Ramsey said Wednesday.
   She said she's been stranded in London since Feb. 17, and has
been unable to get a visa to return to her husband in Charlotte, N.C.
   She married George Ramsey on Sept. 14 and had applied for U.S.
residency, then returned to England five months later for a family
celebration. When her sister suffered a heart attack, she said in a
telephone interview, she stayed past the date she was to return to
the United States.
   On her last visit to the Immigration and Naturalization Service
Office in London, she said, she was told they were waiting for a
report from the FBI.
   The U.S. Embassy press office said it could not comment on the
case because of the restrictions of the Privacy Act.
   ``It's the darnedest thing,'' Ramsey, 65, said in a telephone
interview from Charlotte. ``The lady has never done anything wrong
in her life. All my neighbors keep on asking where my wife is.''
   Mrs. Ramsey, 61, said it was love at first sight when she saw the
young GI on Christmas Eve, 1943 at the Red Lion public house in
Hampton, 15 miles southwest of London.
   ``I thought, what a great guy, if only I could have met him. And
I looked again and he was gone,'' she said.
   Two days later, she found him standing behind her in a bus queue.
They made a date for New Year's Eve, she said, and the romance
blossomed.
   On a Wednesday in March 1944, she said, she went with Ramsey
while he asked his commanding officer for a leave so they could
marry on a Friday.
   ``So Friday evening came, and no George,'' she said.
   Ramsey said his unit had been shipped to France. Later that year,
she gave birth to their son.
   ``He did get back on a very short leave to see and hold his
son,'' Mrs. Ramsey said, but her parents decided she was too young
to marry _ she was in her teens _ and would not permit her to join
him.
   The two lost touch and married other people in their own
countries. Her marriage ended in divorce, while Ramsey is a widower.
   Three years ago, Mrs. Ramsey said, her son contacted his father
in North Carolina, and a correspondence began.
   ``He wrote to me asking if I wanted to see him and we found out
that we still loved each other,'' Mrs. Ramsey said.
   ``He went his way and I went mine, but we still both loved each
other,'' said Ramsey. ``We married (the first time) on the rebound.''
   Mrs. Ramsey said a U.S. immigration official told her it might
take three or four more weeks to clear the paperwork.
   ``Why won't they let me back to my husband?'' she said. ``We're
not getting any younger, and this time that we're losing is very
valuable to us.''

<HEAD>Senate Votes To Allow Reassignment of AIDS Suffers From Food
Handling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Wednesday endorsed a change in a
major civil rights bill to allow AIDS sufferers to be reassigned
from food handling duties.
   The vote was a major election-year victory for Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., and a setback for Majority Leader George Mitchell. Helms is
seeking a fourth term.
   On a voice vote, the Senate approved a non-binding motion by
Helms to have the Americans with Disabilities Act include an
exemption that would allow employers to reassign infected workers
from food-handling jobs.
   Helms' motion instructs Senate negotiators to accept a
House-adopted exemption when they work out a final version of the
bill later this month.
   Sen. Tom Harkin, the Iowa Democrat who sponsored the Senate
measure, said the amendment would ``codify ignorance'' about the
disease and how it is transmitted.
   The House approved the exemption 199-187 last month before it
finally passed the entire disabilities act 403-20. The Senate passed
the bill 76-8 last September.
   The amendment ``goes right at the heart and soul of the Americans
with Disabilities Act,'' said Harkin. ``To pass legislation ... in
spite of the clear and convincing, overwhelming medical evidence
that HIV, that AIDS, cannot be transmitted either through air or
through food, is simply to codify ignorance.''
   But Helms, renewing the House debate, argued that scientific
knowledge and public perception clash. He expressed doubts over the
certainty of knowledge about how AIDS is transmitted and argued that
the amendment was needed because of public ignorance.
   ``We've been told over and over again ... AIDS is supposedly not
communicable by food or drink or casual contact,'' Helms said. ``Now
that is the conventional wisdom. But you try telling that to John Q.
Public.''
   Because the Helms motion was approved on a voice vote, no
individual Senator's vote was recorded. However, the Senate voted
53-40 to reject an earlier motion by Mitchell, a Maine Democrat, to
table the Helms motion.
   The House version of the amendment would allow employers to
reassign HIV-infected workers from food-handling jobs, provided
other positions exist for which they are qualified. Opponents say
that means infected people could be fired or demoted.
   The House adopted the amendment even though Health and Human
Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan said it was unnecessary. The
White House has not, however, spoken out against the amendment
although it specifically endorsed another, unrelated change.
   The House amendment was introduced by Rep. Jim Chapman, D-Texas.
   It was endorsed by the restaurant and food-service industry as
well as by the National Federation of Independent Business, a chief
critic of the entire disabilities bill.
   ``We're enormously disappointed at the Senate vote today and view
it as a significant setback in the effort to protect people with
AIDS from unnecessary discrimination,'' said Gregory L. King of the
Human Rights Campaign Fund, a lobbying group for gay and lesbian
rights.
   ``Ten years into the epidemic, one can only be shocked that so
many senators are unwilling to recognize that AIDS is not spread
through casual contact or through food.''
   The disabilities act has been hailed as the most significant
piece of civil rights legislation since the 1964 Civil Rights Act,
which banned discrimination against racial minorities.
   It would protect the estimated 43 million disabled Americans from
job discrimination. It also would guarantee them access to
businesses, entertainment, accommodations and professional services,
as well as to public and private transportation and telephone
service.

<HEAD>U.S. and Soviet Scientists Call for Deeper Cuts in Nuclear Arms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The superpowers could cut their arsenals of
long-range nuclear weapons by three times the amount planned in a
nearly completed treaty without endangering security, U.S. and
Soviet scientists said Wednesday.
   The groups said in a jointly published book that the United
States and the Soviet Union could reduce the number of strategic
nuclear warheads to fewer than 2,000 each without giving either side
an incentive to launch a first strike.
   In the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks in Geneva, U.S. and Soviet
negotiators are trying to complete a START treaty to reduce to 6,000
the number of warheads on weapons capable of reaching each other's
territory. That would represent about a 30 percent cut from current
levels.
   At last week's summit meeting in Washington, President Bush and
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev reaffirmed their commitment to
completing the START treaty and agreed to pursue negotiations on
further reductions once the treaty is signed and ratified.
   The Federation of American Scientists and the Committee of Soviet
Scientists for Global Security proposed a new way of structuring
arms reduction treaties.
   It would be based on eliminating warheads, not just the vehicles
such as bombers, ballistic missiles or missile launchers that carry
the warheads to targets.
   The START treaty as drafted includes no prohibitions against
removing warheads from long-range missiles and converting them for
use on other weapons. Both the American and Soviet governments say
dismantlement of warheads would give away vital secret information
about the design of their weapons.
   The scientists also said that for warhead dismantlement to be
effective, the superpowers should agree also to halt production of
new fissionable materials, including plutonium and enriched uranium,
used in warheads.
   There is growing congressional interest in pursuing a U.S.-Soviet
agreement to halt nuclear materials production, but the Bush
administration is opposed.
   The scientists noted that both Moscow and Washington already have
been forced to reduce their nuclear materials production because of
safety problems in manufacturing.
   Just this week, new evidence emerged to indicate that problems at
a key U.S. weapons plant are more serious that previously believed.
   A panel of nuclear safety experts commissioned by the Energy
Department to advise Energy Secretary James D. Watkins on weapons
production facilities said Tuesday that plans for resuming plutonium
processing at the Rocky Flats plant in Colorado should be further
delayed to correct numerous training and pollution problems.
   Rocky Flats, the nation's only supplier of plutonium triggers for
nuclear warheads, was closed indefinitely in November because of
safety and management concerns.
   Watkins had indicated recently that he hoped to restart Rocky
Flats this month and that its operation was vital to maintaining the
nation's nuclear weapons stockpile.
   He had no immediate comment on the advisory panel's
recommendation.
   In a related development, the author of a new report by the
private Arms Control Association in Washington told reporters that
Congress was likely to slash 1991 spending for the Star Wars
anti-missile defense by more than 20 percent from 1990 levels.
   Matthew Bunn, an arms control specialist, said it was likely
Congress would approve about $3 billion in spending for Star Wars,
officially the Strategic Defense Initiative, for the budget year
beginning Oct. 1.
   The current budget is $3.8 billion, and the Bush administration
wants $4.8 billion for 1991.

<HEAD>NBC Affiliates Told No Plans for Jane Pauley to Co-anchor ``Nightly
News.''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There are no plans for Jane Pauley to co-anchor
the ``NBC Nightly News,'' but that could change, NBC affiliates were
told Wednesday.
   NBC News president Michael Gartner told affiliate executives that
in a closed-door meeting at the end of their annual convention here,
according to network spokeswoman Betty Hudson.
   ``He specifically said, `We never say never, but there are no
current plans''' for Pauley to join Brokaw on the show, Hudson told
reporters in a briefing.
   NBC Television network president Pier Mapes emphasized that
Pauley's first priority is a series of prime-time specials she will
anchor.
   Pauley, who left NBC's troubled ``Today'' show in December after
controversial changes there, ``is really hot for the prime-time
show,'' he said.
   Pauley, who got a standing ovation Monday from the station
executives, also will do special reports for ``Nightly'' and fill in
for Brokaw when he is on assignment or vacation.
   Her prime-time project, Mapes said, is ``a full-time job in
itself.''
   The question about Pauley's future on ``Nightly'' was raised by
an affiliate executive after published speculation she may co-anchor
the newscast.
   At the briefing, former affiliate board chairman James Sefert and
his successor, Eric Bremner, also disputed a report that the
three-day convention had been NBC's gloomiest since 1985.
   It was upbeat, said Sefert, president of Cosmos Broadcasting in
Greenville, S.C.
   But he and Bremner, president of King Broadcasting in Seattle,
said there was far more work done, including a mass march by
affiliates on Capitol Hill, than ever before.
   Affiliates are worried about cable's growing effect on stations,
and federal financial interest and syndication rules on NBC, and are
seeking ways to help themselves and their network, he said.
   Although NBC has finished first in prime time for five seasons,
Mapes said, the network faces a $200 million shortfall in
advertising revenues because of lower prime-time ratings and
problems he blamed on the ``people-meter'' ratings ssytem.
   ``... Half the problem is the people-meter problem,'' he said.
   The networks blame people-meters, the industry's national ratings
standard since 1987, for what they call an undercounting of viewers.
Nielsen officials say network drops in viewing are real.
   At the closed-door meeting, NBC executives fielded questions on a
variety of other subjects, including cablecasts of pro football
games not available to NBC stations in certain markets.
   Remedying that ``may end up being an FCC matter,'' Mapes said,
adding that NBC officials will take it up with the Federal
Communications Commission.
   Although there had been speculation that Gartner would be the
target of affiliate grumbles over the ``Today'' changes and the
show's drop into second place in the ratings, there was no criticism
at Wednesday's meeting, several station executives said.
   ``I was quite quiet today,'' joked Rhode Island executive David
Henderson, who last year sharply criticzed Gartner for what
Henderson considered NBC's poor coverage of the bloody crackdown on
the student revolution in Beijing.
   ``I think everybody is supportive'' of Gartner, now that he has
announced changes aimed at making both ``Today'' and ``NBC Nightly
News'' ratings contenders again, Henderson said.
   ``It's true, most affiliates were disappointed at what happened''
to ``Today,'' said another station executive, John Williams of
Paducah, Ky.
   ``But he defused the criticism,'' Williams said, referring to
Gartner's frank admission to affiliates Monday that he made mistakes
with ``Today'' and his show-mending moves, including the hiring of
former ``Today'' host Joe Garagiola as a third co-host with Byrant
Gumbel and Deborah Norville.
   The convention was NBC's first in Washington and underscored the
affiliates' increasing attention to making themselves heard on
legislative and regulatory issues affecting broadcasting.

<TEXT>
   A kayaking enthusiast appeared to
wave his paddle triumphantly before plunging over Niagara Falls. And
that was the last anyone has seen of him.
   Jessie Sharp of Ocoee, Tenn., plunged over the 182-foot Horseshoe
Falls on the Canadian side of the border Tuesday afternoon, as
tourists and police _ unable to help him _ looked on.
   He was wearing neither a helmet nor a lifejacket.
   His paddle emerged from the mist at the base of the falls about
10 minutes after his plunge. The dented red kayak, inscribed
``Rapidman,'' surfaced about an hour later a few hundred yards
downstream.
   A day after the stunt, Sharp's body had yet to surface. ``It
could be down there for weeks,'' said Niagara Parks Police Constable
Maureen Quinn.
   The river below the falls is too dangerous for divers to try to
search for the body, Quinn said.
   Sharp, 28, was the 13th known daredevil to challenge the falls
since 1901 and the fourth to lose his life. All previous attempts on
record have involved barrels or inflated rubber containers.
   Had Sharp survived his trip, he would have been subject to a
$10,000 (Canadian) fine for attempting an illegal stunt, Quinn said.
   Police interviewed three friends who accompanied Sharp from
Tennessee, but decided not to charge them, Quinn said.
   ``They didn't assist him in any criminal way,'' she said.
   Jeff Latham, a parks police constable who watched Sharp's plunge,
said the kayaker held his paddle aloft and twirled it in the air
just before going over the brink.
   Latham said the gesture reminded him of a football player spiking
the ball in the end zone, but kayakers said they generally lean back
and raise the paddle above their head just before a fall as a
protective measure.
   Ocoee, a small town 35 miles from Chattanooga in southeast
Tennessee, is on the Ocoee River, a nationally famous whitewater
stream. The U.S. Slalom Team Trials were held there in early May.
   Jim Snyder, an Albright, W.Va., author, predicted in a 1987 book
that kayak technology and skill levels would evolve to the point
that making it over Niagara Falls would be possible. That time is
yet to arrive, he said Tuesday night.
   ``You need a very specific plan to do a falls over 80 feet,'' he
said. ``You should be in a boat specially designed to support your
back, and you have to have a perfect launch. Anything less than that
spells disaster.''
   A kayaker trying to navigate a tall waterfall also must paddle
hard just before the brink so he shoots out away from the falling
water to land in the foam below, Snyder said.
   ``If you fall with the water, you've failed,'' he said. ``If he
and his boat were not visible during the fall, he was doomed from
the beginning.''

   President Hashemi Rafsanjani urged the United
States Wednesday to press Israel and Kuwait to release Moslem
prisoners in exchange for help in gaining freedom for the 16 Western
captives in Lebanon.
   Rafsanjani also indicated Iran might soon begin direct peace
talks with Iraq to formally end the Persian Gulf war.
   ``The irresponsible, arrogant attitude of the United States has
created further difficulties'' in resolving the hostage crisis,
Rafsanjani told a news conference for 200 foreign and local
journalists.
   Iran and the pro-Iranian groups holding the hostages in Lebanon
have often demanded the United States press Israel to free 350
Moslems it holds in Israel and in a strip of land it controls in
southern Lebanon.
   But it was the first time in some months that an Iranian leader
referred to 15 Shiite Moslems, most of Iranian origin, jailed in
Kuwait since 1984 for car bombings in Kuwait directed against the
U.S. and French embassies.
   In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher
said he had not seen Rafsanjani's remarks but that U.S. policy is to
urge the ``immediate, safe and unconditional release of all
hostages.''
   At Tehran's bidding, two American educators, Robert Polhill and
Frank Reed, were released in April. Iran has said Washington should
make a goodwill gesture in return. President Bush has said he won't
deal with Iran to secure further hostage releases.
   ``An appropriate response was expected after the Lebanese
unconditionally set free the hostages _ release of hostages in
Kuwait and Israel,'' Rafsanjani said.
   ``Why don't you help increase the necessary public pressure on
those governments to release these hostages, so that the Western
hostages can be freed in return?'' he asked the journalists.
   ``If the United States is serious about wanting relations with
Iran in the future, it must begin to act, because talking is not
enough,'' Rafsanjani said.
   Polhill and Reed were the first U.S. captives to be released in
3{ years. Six Americans are among the Westerners still held in
Lebanon. The longest-held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for the Associated Press. He was abducted in March
1985.
   The other hostages are four Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss,
an Italian and an Irishman.
   Referring to Iran's death threats against British author Salman
Rushdie, Rafsanjani said ties with London could be resumed if Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher condemns Rushdie's book ``The Satanic
Verses.'' Ties between the nations were severed following the 1989
call for Moslems to execute Rushdie.
   Rafsanjani said, however, that there was no question of lifting
the death sentence on Rushdie, who Iran says defamed Islam in his
book.
   Rafsanjani said Iran's policy was ``to help secure the release of
all the hostages, whether they be Western, Lebanese or Iranian. We
continued ... to hold on to this policy.''
   The Iranian president reiterated his country's claim that four
Iranians _ two diplomats, a journalist and a driver _ who were
kidnapped by the Christian Lebanese Forces militia in 1982 are still
alive.
   ``We have learned officially from a government, and from reliable
sources in east Beirut, that the Iranian hostages are alive,''
Rafsanjani said. ``The special envoy of a certain government has
informed us.''
   He did not identify the country.
   The Bush administration recently provided Iran with information,
through the Swiss government, which Washington said indicated the
four men were dead.
   Speaking about the gulf war, Rafsanjani said President Saddam
Hussein of Iraq recently sent two letters to the Iranian leadership
suggesting the two leaders meet for talks on a permanent settlement
to the conflict, which ended in a cease-fire in August 1988.
   ``We have not given a negative reply to Iraq's proposal calling
for a meeting of the two heads of state,'' Rafsanjani said.
   ``But issues must be sorted out in preliminary negotiations at
expert level and in consultations with the United Nations
secretary-general to guarantee the success of such a meeting, if
there is going to be one.''
   Hostilities between Iran and Iraq were halted under U.N. Security
Council Resolution, but talks to turn the truce into a peace
settlement have been stalemated ever since.

   Janet Elaine Adkins spent 13 years teaching
hundreds of immigrants and refugees to become self-sufficient and
independent _ the very qualities she knew were being stolen from her
by Alzheimer's disease.
   Unwilling to relinquish her self-determination, the 54-year-old
Portland woman instead chose to give up her life.
   On Monday, hooked to an intravenous device in a van at a
campground near Detroit, she pressed a button that released a lethal
drug into her veins and died within minutes. She told Dr. Jack
Kevorkian, the retired pathologist who invented the device and was
with her: ``You just make my case known.''
   ``I have decided for the following reason to take my own life,''
Mrs. Adkins wrote in a short statement made public by her husband.
   ``This is a decision taken in a normal state of mind and is fully
considered. I have Alzheimer's disease and do not want to let it
progress any farther.''
   People who knew Mrs. Adkins, even briefly, remarked on her
enthusiasm and zest for life. She was a strong, decisive woman,
family members said.
   ``She has a real joie de vivre, a real spirit for life,'' said
her son Neil.
   Mrs. Adkins, a native of Longview, Wash., was the mother of three
grown sons, Neil, Norman and Ronald, and had three grandsons. She
was diagnosed as having Alzheimer's almost a year ago.
   ``She was an exciting person. She loved philosophy. She loved
reading good literature. She was a good musician, loved playing the
piano. And really, she loved life and to the fullest,'' said Ron
Adkins, her husband of 34 years. ``She was always coming up with
ideas of new places to go.
   ``She was an adventurer. She climbed Mount Hood. She went to the
Himalayas and to Nepal and she went up in gliders and in a hot air
balloon. And we did travel, we lived in Europe. She spoke French.
She taught at the community college ... which she dearly loved. This
was a woman that was a very, very special woman.''
   As a teacher of English as a second language at Portland
Community College, Mrs. Adkins helped Southeast Asian refugees and
others gain the skills to survive in America, department chairman
Joe Ponce said.
   She graduated in 1972 from Portland State University, where she
majored in English and minored in French. She received her teaching
certificate in 1979 and joined the English as a second language
program in 1980, he said.
   In addition to her duties at the college, she had taught workers
at Tektronix Inc. in Beaverton and did summer work at Wilson High
School.
   She resigned in June 1989 because she wanted to pursue other
personal interests, he said.
   ``She was a very fine teacher. Anyone who works with the refugee
or immigrant programs has to have a lot of personal skills and has
to care a lot,'' Ponce said.
   ``She was enthusiastic, she had a good sense of humor. She
certainly enjoyed her work. I think that's a marked sign of a
successful teacher, someone who finds the job enjoyable continuously
_ certainly for that many years.''
   Neil Adkins said his mother also had been an accomplished
musician on the piano and had played French horn in college. In
recent years, however, she had stopped playing the piano and had
trouble reading.
   Alzheimer's disease is an irreversible degeneration of the brain
cells leading to severe memory loss, dementia and death.
   ``The bomb, as we called it, was dropped on us in June of last
year, and it was really very devastating to Janet,'' Ron Adkins
said. ``She was very much aware of Alzheimer's and what happens.''
   He said his wife knew exactly what she was doing this week and
insisted upon it.
   ``Right up to the very end when she left me and we said our last
goodbye, she was holding me up,'' said Adkins. ``And she was very up
and very happy with the doctor that she was able to have this way of
delivering herself.''
   Mrs. Adkins had asked that she be cremated after death, with her
ashes to be flown home and dispersed in the Pacific off the craggy
Oregon coast. A memorial service was scheduled Sunday.
   Mrs. Adkins was a member of the National Hemlock Society, which
advocates death with dignity, before her illness was diagnosed.
   ``She felt it was unfair that other people could tell you when to
die,'' her husband said.
   ``She was a wonderful wife and great inspiration to family and
friends ... But she didn't want to end up losing her dignity.''

   President Bush and Greek Premier Constantine
Mitsotakis marked ``a new beginning of an old friendship''
Wednesday, with Greece's conservative new leader appealing for U.S.
help to prod Turkey to end the stalemate over Cyprus.
   Bush, in turn, renewed a U.S. request for extradition of a
Palestinian wanted in the 1982 bombing of a Pan Am jet over Hawaii
that killed a Japanese teen-ager.
   Mitsotakis, the first Greek leader invited to the White House in
26 years, said the meeting ``inaugurates a new period of relations
between the two countries.''
   In the two months since Mitsotakis' New Democracy Party turned
socialist Andreas Papandreou's government out of power, the United
States and Greece have already initialed a new military base
agreement that had eluded the two NATO allies.
   ``The two presidents agreed that this visit was important for a
new beginning of an old friendship,'' said White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater.
   Mitsotakis told reporters that he asked Bush to use his influence
to help settle the dispute over Cyprus, which has been partitioned
between Greek and Turkish Cypriots who have feuded over the island
for generations.
   ``I told him that presently we are at a dead end and some gesture
... should be made from the Turkish side,'' Mitsotakis said.
   Mitsotakis told The Washington Post in an interview published
Wednesday that he would urge Bush to prod the Turkish government to
cut in half its forces that have occupied the island since 1974.
Turkey has 30,000 troops in the northern half of the island.
   The Greek leader said efforts by the United Nations needed a
boost, ``and I believe that the United States can play a very
important role in the matter.''
   Bush, he said, seemed very interested.
   Fitzwater said Bush made it clear ``that the status quo on the
island was not satisfactory.''
   Bush, according to Fitzwater, said action must be taken but
``reiterated that our view of the best course of doing that is
within the U.N.''
   Fitzwater said the two leaders ``agreed to combat terrorism
wherever they can and however they can.''
   Mitsotakis' son-in-law, Pavlos Bakoyannis, was assassinated on an
Athens street by a terrorist group in September. Bakoyannis' widow,
Dora, who subsequently won her slain husband's seat in parliament,
joined her father in the White House talks.
   The Greek leader also Bush that the U.S. extradition request for
Mohammed Rashid would be decided before September. Rashid is wanted
in connection with the jet bombing that killed a Japanese teen-ager
and wounded 15 other people.
   U.S.-Greco relations were often strained during Papandreou's
eight-year tenure.
   The base agreement initialed by the two governments will allow
the U.S. military presence in Greece to continue, but two of the
four U.S. bases in Greece _ Helleniko Air Force Base near Athens and
a naval communications station _ will be closed.
   Mitsotakis's New Democracy Party has 150 seats in the 300-member
Parliament. A conservative deputy from a small party has given it a
voting majority.
   As a NATO ally, Greece is slated to receive $345 million in
military aid during the next fiscal year. No terms of the new
agreement have been made public.
   Mitsotakis said Bush had accepted an invitation to visit Greece,
and invited Mitsotakis back to Washington for an official visit. No

   Federal regulators assured members of Congress
Wednesday that a government crackdown on bank lending is not the
cause of a credit squeeze in some regions
   Behind closed doors, however, bankers are pleading with the
regulators to ease up.
   Senior federal banking officials, appearing before the House
Small Business Committee, conceded that some banks are making it
more difficult for businesses to get loans, particularly for
commercial real estate projects.
   But they said that is mostly a justified response to a sluggish
economy rather than a reaction to intensified scrutiny from
government examiners.
   Meanwhile, chief executives of some of the nation's largest banks
have asked the Federal Reserve Board to bend capital standards while
they work off losses from sour real estate loans.
   The request came from the Fed's 12-member Advisory Council at a
private May 3 meeting in Washington. The central bank keeps the
minutes of the council's sessions secret for three years, but a copy
from last month's meeting was obtained by The Associated Press.
   The council suggested that regulators should permit banks to
deduct real estate loan losses from their earnings over a period of
years rather than all at once. They also asked for relaxed capital
rules to permit banks to hold on to repossessed real estate rather
than selling it in a depressed market.
   Such accounting measures, while maintaining the appearance of
balanced books, have been blamed for contributing to the savings and
loan crisis.
   The council's request to the Fed for lenience was originally
disclosed in Wednesday editions of USA Today.
   Regulators told the small business panel, chaired by Rep. John J.
LaFalce, D-N.Y., that they have cautioned their examiners not to be
overzealous in scrutinizing loans.
   But, for the most part, they stood firm in the face of strong
congressional criticism that credit-worthy constituents were having
trouble getting loans.
   ``A slowdown in certain markets seems entirely warranted given
current economic conditions,'' said Federal Reserve Board member
John P. LaWare.
   ``In my view, banks should be applauded for tightening lending
standards,'' said Paul G. Fritts, supervision director for the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   He said regulators' critics are confusing a normal credit
contraction during a time of economic downturn with a credit crunch
in which legitimate projects cannot attract financing.
   He said bankers often use regulators as an excuse for a decision
that angers a customer.
   However, Rep. Richard E. Neal, D-Mass., whose state has been
among the hardest hit by a slump in real estate, said, ``Regardless
of what's been stated today, a perception has been created that a
curtain has been dropped over some of the entrepreneurship that
we've witnessed in New England over the last decade.''
   Del. Walter Fauntroy, D-D.C., complained about scarcity of
business loans in the nation's capital.
   ``Some banks throttled their lending down so sharply that some
members of the (House) Banking Committee began to fear a
full-fledged credit crunch,'' he said. ``I am here to urge the
regulators to moderate their approach.''

   More women candidates than ever will be on
California's general election ballot in November, when Dianne
Feinstein will ask voters to make her the state's first woman
governor.
   Besides Feinstein, four of five women who were seeking
nominations to statewide office won their party primaries Tuesday,
and voters ensured that one general election race will be between
two women.
   No more than two women have ever been on a California general
election ballot before.
   Feinstein, the former mayor of San Francisco, made a special plea
to women throughout her Democratic primary campaign to help her
``make history'' as California's first woman governor.
   U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, the Republican nominee, immediately moved
to defuse that appeal Wednesday.
   ``I think that women, as well as men, are going to be much more
influenced by the quality of candidates, by their performance, by
their ideas, than by their sex,'' Wilson said.
   After a costly, bruising primary campaign, Feinstein defeated
state Attorney General John Van de Kamp by a 52-to-41 percent
margin. In final, unofficial returns, Feinstein had 1,296,589 votes
to Van de Kamp's 1,012,516.
   Wilson received 88 percent of the Republican vote against only
token opposition.
   An exit poll by the Los Angeles Times reported that Feinstein won
nearly two-thirds of the women's vote, and narrowly edged Van de
Kamp among male voters.
   Asked Wednesday what her nomination proved, Feinstein said, ``No
mountain is too high and no door is so closed it can't be opened.''
   Other women who won Tuesday included:
   _State Sen. Marian Bergeson, who won the Republican nomination
for lieutenant governor.
   _Kathleen Brown, daughter of former Gov. Pat Brown and sister of
former Gov. Jerry Brown, who captured the Democratic nomination for
state treasurer.
   _Democrat March Fong Eu and Republican Joan Milke Flores, who won
their parties' nominations for secretary of state. Eu is the
incumbent, and one of only two women to ever win a statewide office
in California's 140-year history.
   Eu's victory marked a first of a different kind, since her son,
Matthew Fong, won the Republican nomination for state controller.
Never before have a mother and son run for state office at the same
time in California.
   The only woman seeking a statewide office who didn't make it to
the November ballot was former U.S. Treasurer Angela ``Bay''
Buchanan, sister of conservative political commentator Pat Buchanan.
She lost the Republican nomination for state treasurer to incumbent
Tom Hayes by 8 percentage points.
   Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson, who was heavily criticized in his
failed attempt to bring the Los Angeles Raiders football team back
to Oakland, was soundly defeated in his bid for a fifth term.
   The primary balloting also marked _ both in symbolism and
substance _ a reversal of political priorities from the anti-tax
philosophy that dominated the 1980s as Californians voted to double
their state gasoline taxes from 9 to 18 cents per gallon.
   The gasoline tax increase, approved by a 53 percent majority, is
expected to raise $15.5 billion over the next decade for new highway
and mass transit projects to ease the state's growing traffic
congestion.
   In some of California's 45 congressional races:
   _Democratic incumbent Jim Bates was nominated for a fifth term,
despite the negative publicity of a formal rebuke by the House
Ethics Committee for sexual harassment of women employees.
   _Actor Ralph Waite, ``Papa Walton'' of the television series, won
the Democratic nomination for a seat now held by Republican Al Mc
Candless in the Palm Springs area.
   _Tim Stoen, attorney for the People's Temple before the cult's
mass suicide with 912 deaths over a decade ago, lost the Republican
nomination to oppose Democratic incumbent Doug Bosco in California's
north coast redwood country.

   Spiders, snakes, prairie dogs and about 40 rats
roam Samantha Martin's apartment. And she wouldn't have it any other
way.
   They're her pets, but they're also her livelihood.
   The professional animal trainer has hit the Chicago nightclub
circuit with The Rat Company and Friends _ a menagerie of rodents,
reptiles, chinchillas, one tarantula and a South American animal she
describes as ``a honey bear, a raccoon and a monkey all rolled into
one.''
   ``People see the ad in the paper and they say, `No, this can't
be,''' she said. ``But they come and see, and some of them come up
after the show and want to pet them.''
   The show has become a local cult hit, with some fans turning up
at performance after performance.
   The rodent revue changes with the season _ the rats wear angel
wings during the Christmas season and ride brooms during Halloween.
   John Herron of Evanston hired the show last year for a holiday
party.
   ``The guests went into hysterics. It was fantastic,'' he said.
``The animals are comedians. Our cat, though, was pacing the house,
because there were all these rats here and she didn't know what to
do.''
   Chicago animal control officials said they know about the offbeat
performers, but haven't had any problems with them.
   Housing her rodent-dominated troupe at her apartment could be a
problem, but she said she's been lucky so far _ her landlords never
come over to visit.
   ``I mean, if they ask if I've got any pets, and I say, `Well,
I've got about 40 rats and a tarantula,' I'd be homeless forever,''
she said.

<TEXT>
   Raunch comic Andrew Dice Clay's ``Saturday
Night Live'' performance won't be rerun by NBC, the network's
entertainment chief said Wednesday.
   Brandon Tartikoff's promise came at a closed-door session of
affiliate executives on the closing day of the network's convention
here, NBC spokesmen said.
   His announcement came after what several affiliates at the
meeting described as sharp criticism of the Clay show by Cliff
Brown, a Hattiesburg, Miss., broadcaster.
   Tartikoff told the affiliates that Clay was a last-minute booking
for the show broadcast last month after a previous guest host
dropped out. He didn't identify the dropout.
   ``We didn't think it would create the controversy it did,''
Tartikoff said of Clay's booking, according to NBC spokesman Curt
Block.
   ``It's too bad that show tarnished what was an otherwise good
year'' for the program, Block quoted the NBC Entertainment president
as saying.
   The appearance by Clay, whose routine is filled with sexually
explicit language and disparages gays and women, prompted boycotts
of the program by cast member Nora Dunn and guest singer Sinead
O'Connor.
   The show drew more than 1,000 protests from viewers.

   James W. Jackson Jr., writer-producer for
the old PBS series ``Lowell Thomas Remembers,'' has died of injuries
sustained in a car crash. He was 66.
   He was killed in an automobile accident Tuesday when his car
skidded out of control and struck a tree near Winnsboro, where he
lived. Fairfield County Coroner Joe Silvia said Jackson's Porsche
was traveling about 120 mph when it crashed.
   At the time of his death, Jackson was working on a television
series about former South Carolina Gov. Robert E. McNair.
   In the mid-1970s, he was instrumental in helping the University
of South Carolina get 20th Century Fox's Movietonews library valued
at $60 million to $100 million. The library has footage from the old
newsreels shown in movie theaters from 1919 to 1963.
   Jackson was director of college's news film library from 1980,
when the newsreels were obtained, until he retired in 1988.
   Jackson produced and wrote for the acclaimed ``Lowell Thomas
Remembers'' during the 1970s.
   He was a sports editor for The Columbia Record and an announcer
and promotion manager for WIS-TV in Columbia. During World War II,
Jackson was a pilot in the Army and worked as an education officer
in the Korean War.
   Jackson is survived by his wife, Jackie; a daughter, Lynne, of
Columbia; and two sons, James of Conroe, Texas, and Thomas of
Morgantown, W.Va.

   After a decade of trying to reach planes
buried in Arctic ice since World War II, a thermal borer Wednesday
banged against the skin of a B-17.
   The bomber is one of eight planes _ two B-17s and six
twin-engine, P-38 Lightning fighters _ that crash-landed on the
Greenland icecap; they ran out of fuel en route to Europe after
being decoyed by false radio transmissions from German submarines in
1942.
   Pat Epps, who with Richard Taylor co-founded the Greenland
Expedition Society, heard by radio from Greenland on Wednesday
morning that the group had succeeded in reaching the plane.
   ``They're going to try to enlarge the hole to get into a hatch,''
said Epps, owner of an air service in suburban Atlanta.
   Taylor planned to descend 250 feet to the plane through a 42-inch
shaft, Epps said.
   ``We plan to get the fighters out this year. We will work until
September 1,'' said Epps, who returned from the icecap last week.
   The team left Atlanta on May 3 for Greenland. A second unit, led
by Angelo Pizzagalli of Burlington, Vt., left a week later.
   While Taylor and the first group got to the first bomber,
Pizzagalli, president of Pizzagalli Construction Co., and his men
used a huge auger to bore a hole 16 feet in diameter to one of the
P-38s, a plane the Germans called a ``fork-tailed devil.''
   They fell behind schedule because of bad weather, including two
blizzards after they landed on the ice in southeastern Greenland.
   The eight planes crash-landed July 15, 1942. Their crews camped
in one of the B-17s for nine days until a sled dog team, which
mushed into a spot fixed by radio triangulation, arrived to lead
them to the coast.
   A month later, officials learned the Norden bombsight on one of
the bombers had not been destroyed, so Army Air Force Col. Norman
Vaughan went in alone by dogsled to get it before it could fall into
the hands of the Germans, who had weather stations in the area.
   Vaughan, a vice president of the Greenland Expedition Society, is
among the crew of a dozen men working on the icecap.
   The planes were forgotten until the early 1970s, when Col. Carl
Rudder, one of the P-38 pilots, mentioned them to Roy Degan, a
commercial airline pilot who brought the idea of an Arctic
expedition to Epps.
   Epps and Taylor founded the Greenland Expedition Society in 1981.
Vaughan, of Trapper Creek, Alaska, learned about the group from a
newspaper story and joined up.
   The society eventually obtained search and salvage rights from
the government of Denmark, which owns Greenland.
   In 1988, the society found the aircraft using low-frequency
subsurface radar. Last year, expedition members drilled down to the
B-17 and brought back poker chip-size pieces of its skin.
   Epps declined to say how much money the society has raised or
spent on its efforts, but he estimated it will have spent $800,000
to $1 million by Sept. 1. It is financed by its own fund-raising
efforts and the work of Rolls Ltd., Pizzagalli's non-profit
corporation in Vermont.

   Petty thieves vandalized Abraham
Lincoln's Tomb, creating a permanent eyesore while stealing $100 in
small change.
   The vandals rolled a pair of 200-pound urns from atop the tomb
onto granite steps leading to an observation deck, chipping the
steps. And they broke into a vault where the 16th president's body
was kept temporarily after his death, where they stole coins left by
tourists.
   They didn't enter the 116-year-old chamber where Lincoln is
entombed.
   ``The urns can be replaced, but the steps will always be
broken,'' said monument manager Nan Wynn, estimating damage at
$1,600.
   The thieves apparently used bolt cutters to get into the empty
burial vault where Lincoln's body was kept until the tomb was built.
   There they stole coins worth an estimated $100 that tourists
tossed into the vault through an iron gate, Ms. Wynn said.
   The damage and theft were discovered Tuesday morning by a
maintenance worker.
   ``They obviously did it for the money,'' Ms. Wynn said. ``It's
not something that's going to be a danger to anyone. It's just an
eyesore.''
   In 1987, five teen-age vandals spray-painted graffiti and racial
slogans on the tomb, and knocked over or broke about 30 nearby
tombstones.

   A flight attendant, a paper mill worker and a
tool and die employee, all stung by long labor disputes, asked a
Senate panel Wednesday to approve a bill that would ban the hiring
of permanent replacement workers.
   The three witnesses described how they had suffered because
companies favored replacement workers or strikers who crossed picket
lines.
   ``I will suffer the effects of filing bankruptcy for many years
because it will be difficult to obtain credit and impossible to
obtain a mortgage,'' said Norma Adams of New York, a Trans World
Airlines flight attendant.
   She said she was on strike for two months but had to wait nearly
a year before resuming her work.
   ``We only have to look at history to realize that greed and power
are destructive,'' said Thomas J. Pratt of Livermore Falls, Maine, a
former International Paper Co. employee.
   ``Let's balance the power between corporations and its employees
and hopefully they can reconcile differences without the use of
strikes or lockouts,'' he said.
   Ms. Adams, Pratt and Carol Miller of Woodstock, Ill., said their
employers deliberately sought to anger unions during contract talks
so they could hire replacement workers at a lower cost.
   Appearing before a Senate labor subcommittee, the three witofficials
who will study the food processing systems of the two
countries and determine how U.S. technology and methods can be
incorporated into the Soviet system.
   A high proportion of Soviet food production has been reported to
spoil because of inefficient distribution, handling and storage
before it reaches the consumer.
   Nikitin said the agreement was a small step, ``but everything
starts with a small step.''
   ``For you, it's a key if you want to participate in the
strengthening of our economy,'' he said through an interpreter.
   The pact was signed on the last day of a three-day conference
sponsored by the Food Processing Machinery &amp; Supplies Association
and the National Food Processors Association.
   Fifty-five Soviet officials met with representatives of more than
50 food companies, administration and congressional officials
seeking deals that could lead to increased business for Americans
and modernization of food distribution for the Soviet Union.
   John Cady, president of the food processors association, said
barriers are beginning to come down, though Americans still are
concerned about getting paid for business with the Soviets.
   Soviet currency is of almost no value in the world market,
leaving those companies doing business in the Soviet Union to either
accept products in exchange or wait for long-term gains after the
economy there improves.
   ``We have to understand when companies invest, it's not going to
be a three-year turn-around, but probably eight to 10 years,'' said
Cady.

<HEAD>American Diet and Lifestyle Creates Cancer Risk, Study Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese immigrants who adopt the typical
American diet and lifestyle are four to seven times more likely to
develop colorectal cancer than those people who remain in China, a
researcher said Wednesday.
   A lack of exercise and lots of rich American foods containing
saturated fats make the difference, said Alice S. Whittemore of
Stanford University.
   ``If you want to avoid the disease, I would by all means stay
active,'' she said in a telephone interview. ``Even more
importantly, take it easy on rich high fat dairy products and very
fatty red meat. Eating fish and chicken is certainly prudent.''
   The study, published this week in the Journal of the National
Cancer Institute, is based on interviews with Chinese in the
People's Republic of China and with Chinese-Americans who immigrated
to the United States or whose parents immigrated.
   About 90 percent of the Chinese-Americans interviewed came to the
United States as young adults.
   Of those chosen for interviews, 473 Americans and 432 Chinese had
either colon or rectal cancer. The researchers also interviewed
1,192 Chinese-Americans and 1,295 people in China who were free of
disease but who lived near those with the cancers.
   The interviews probed diet, exercise and other habits of all the
subjects.
   For the Chinese-Americans, Ms. Whittemore said, the interviewers
explored every aspect of westernization, including such things as
use of herbal medicines, languages spoken at home and even which
newspapers were read. All those factors were correlated with the
incidence of colon and rectal cancer.
   ``The strongest risk factor we found was saturated fat in the
diet and the American sedentary lifestyle,'' Ms. Whittemore said.
   Chinese-American men, who had four to seven times more colon or
rectal cancer than men of the same age in the People's Republic of
China, got less exercise and were more likely to eat high quantities
of food rich in animal or dairy fat.
   The colorectal cancer rates among the Chinese-American men are
about the same as among white American men, Ms. Whittemore said.
   The cancer rates among Chinese-American women, however, was lower
than among the Chinese-American men, but higher than among the
Chinese women.
   ``We were puzzled by this at first, but what we found out is that
the Chinese-American men have been here 10 years longer (than the
women) on the average,'' Ms. Whittemore said.
   ``They migrated earlier and didn't bring their wives over until
they had money to support them. The women haven't been here long
enough.''
   That finding, she said, showed that the duration of exposure to
the American diet and lifestyle are important in the risk of
colorectal cancer _ the longer the Chinese lived in the United
States, the greater their risk of the disease.
   Ms. Whittemore said there were other impressive differences
besides saturated fat in diets of the two countries. The Chinese
tend to eat more calories every day, ``but they burn up far more
calories.''
   ``The calories (the Chinese) consume are mostly carbohydrates,
mostly from rice,'' she said. ``The average guy over there does not
eat like we do in a Chinese restaurant here. They have a hard time
getting meat, so their diet is largely carbohydrates.''
   Ms. Whittemore said the Chinese also eat more vegetables than
Americans and that, to some degree, seemed to help block the
formation of the cancers.
   ``Vegetables appeared to be protective,'' she said. ``The more
vegetables you eat, the lower your risks.''

   California voters, who launched a tax revolt
that spread across the nation a decade ago, may have given up their
tightfisted ways. In a new shift of the political winds, they voted
to double their gasoline tax and raise billions of dollars for mass
transit, schools and the poor.
   ``It really does end the tax revolt in California, and sends a
message to Washington which I dislike intensely,'' conservative
economist Arthur Laffer said Wednesday, the day after the statewide
spending spree.
   In the late 1970s, Laffer helped win voter approval of the twin
foundations of the California tax revolt _ Proposition 13, a 1978
property tax-slashing measure, and a follow-up government spending
lid that passed the next year.
   Proposition 111, which passed by a 52-to-48 percent margin
Tuesday, will double the state's gasoline tax, from 9 cents to 18
cents, over five years. The tax will raise $15.5 billion for a
10-year freeway building and improvement program intended to slow
the slide toward automotive gridlock.
   But it also eases the spending limit initiatives that formed the
cornerstone of the tax revolt movement, reversing political
priorities from the anti-tax philosophy that dominated the last
decade.
   The measure was championed by Gov. George Deukmejian and a
heavyweight business-labor coalition. It was extremely popular in
freeway-laced cities but soundly rejected in the most rural regions.
   Supporters said the economy, environment, and quality of life
were at stake in the vote. Last October's earthquake, which toppled
a freeway in Oakland, also played a role.
   ``I believe it clearly says if you come with a good reason to
spend the money, voters will approve and sanction what you've
done,'' Assembly Speaker Willie Brown said.
   U.S. Secretary of Transportation Samuel K. Skinner said he was
``delighted'' with the vote. He said it validates the Bush
adminstration's argument that voters are willing to raise taxes for
highways and other transportation needs.
   California's gas tax currently ranks 47th in the nation, well
below the national average of 15.8 cents a gallon. If other states'
taxes were to stay the same, California would rank 23rd in the
nation after Proposition 111 goes into full effect, according to
Oliver Yandle of the Highway Users Federation in Washington.
   Voters also passed two bond measures, one a companion to
Proposition 111 and the other sponsored by environmentalists, that
together provide nearly $3 billion for mass-transit rail
construction throughout the state.
   The ballot carried five other bond measures _ the most bond
funding for a single election in California history. Voters approved
them all. They include $150 million to house the homeless and four
others to provide $2 billion to build new prisons, make state and
local government buildings safer andupgrade public schools and
universities.
   Altogether, Californians approved 15 of the 17 propositions on
the statewide ballot, rejecting only two Republican-sponsored
initiatives to take reapportionment of congressional and legislative
districts out of the hands of the Democrat-controlled Legislature.
   Other successful ballot propositions impose strict new ethical
standards on the Legislature and attempt to streamline criminal
trial procedures and reduce potential appeals.
   Environmentalists scored a victory with passage of a mountain
lion protection initiative.
   In local elections, San Francisco voters approved a record $332
million bond issue to help pay for repairs from last October's
earthquake. Voters in two San Francisco Bay area counties _ Alameda
and Marin _ voted down measures to create or strengthen ``nuclear
free zones.''
   But the multimillion-dollar standout among the propositions was
the gas-tax hike that California Chamber of Commerce President Kirk
West, who helped steer the campaign, called ``a referendum on
California's future.''
   The measure, expected to raise each motorist's costs an average
of 16 cents a day, will supply the majority of funding for the
largest single transportation investment in California history.
   Its companion measure, Proposition 108, will raise $1 billion
through the sale of bonds to pay for a variety of mass-transit rail
projects, including intercity Amtrak service, commuter lines and
light rail systems, such as those that exist in Sacramento, San
Diego and San Francisco.
   Proposition 116, supported by environmentalists, will raise an
extra $1.99 billion by selling bonds to finance 29 mass-transit
projects. Virtually all will be rail improvements, including about
$280 million in work affecting Southern Pacific, which donated
$150,000 to the campaign to pass the measure.
   Because road and rail construction has not kept pace with
population increases, California drivers now waste more than 400,000
hours a day because the average speed on urban freeways has fallen
to about 20 mph during commute hours.

   Offerings to the Hawaiian volcano goddess
failed to save the Kalapana Store and Drive-Inn, which succumbed
Wednesday to lava flowing from Kilauea Volcano.
   Owner Walter Yamaguchi, 82, had defiantly proclaimed his store
would remain untouched by the lava because of his special
relationship with the volcano goddess Pele.
   But before dawn, a lava finger extending from the flow engulfed
the last remaining landmark in this devastated rural seaside town,
Civil Defense officials said.
   ``Well, what can you do?'' Yamaguchi said. ``Pele, she made me
collect the insurance. If no burn, I don't collect.''
   The store was the 161st structure destroyed by lava since Kilauea
began its latest series of eruptions in January 1983. About 20
buildings remain.
   Yamaguchi said he had been making traditional offerings of gin
and ti leaves to Pele every day in hopes of appeasing her.
   Two flows that snaked through the area last month passed within 5
feet of his store, adding to Yamaguchi's reputation as a volcano
prophet.
   In 1977, he correctly predicted that a flow would stop before it
reached his store, once the main public gathering in Kalapana.
   No other structures in the now-deserted community were hit
Wednesday as lava continued to pour from the Kupaianaha vent at a
rate of 650,000 cubic meters a day, officials said.
   Lava flowed into the ocean near the site of the Puna Canoe Club.
There was little movement in other areas of the flow.
   The destruction of the store allows Yamaguchi to travel to
California with a clear conscience later this month for dental work.
   ``Now my worries are over,'' he said. ``I made plans to go the
Mainland. My false teeth are no good.''

   Finnish authorities sent a jet plane to
check on possible danger from a mysterious cloud drifting west from
the Soviet Union on Wednesday, but the large cloud changed course
and stayed over Soviet territory.
   Weather analysts and radiation monitors in several Nordic
countries described the cloud as about 60 miles long and 9,900 to
16,500 feet above ground. They said the cloud, warmer than the
surrounding air, was emitting steam or smoke.
   ``It could have been caused by some sort of disaster or accident.
But it could also be just an ordinary large cloud,'' said Markku
Konttinen of the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
   Late Wednesday, the Finnish Center for Radiation and Nuclear
Safety in Helsinki said in a telephone recorded message, ``It is
apparent that the air samples already taken won't reveal the
composition of the cloud. ... The origins of the cloud are not
necessarily unusual.
   ``Increased monitoring will be continued as a safety precaution
for the time being. But nothing unusual has been recorded at
radiation monitoring point,'' the center said.
   Earlier, the center said safety checks ``to determine whether the
cloud is radioactive have been put into force.''
   Weatherman Jouko Korhonen said the cloud ``has all the appearance
of a normal, large cloud and its direction is southeasterly at the
moment.'' That would keep the cloud over the Soviet Union.
   ``We won't find out about the upper layers of the cloud ... now
that it is moving away,'' Korhonen said. But he said air samples
could still yield some information.
   ``If there really was something irregular there, then the lower
layers of air, which are still heading in the direction of northern
Finland, are more important,'' Korhonen said.
   Officials in Rovaniemi, a military aviation center on the Arctic
Circle in Lapland, said a Finnish Air Force jet took samples from
Finnish airspace. The samples were being sent to Helsinki for
analysis.
   The officials said the plane did not encounter the cloud.
   Earlier, weather observers cited satellite photos as showing the
cloud was headed from the Barents Sea toward northern Finland. The
Barents Sea is north and east of the Kola Peninsula in northwestern
Soviet Union.
   The Finnish Center for Radiation and Nuclear Safety quoted Soviet
sources this week as reporting four nuclear power plants are
operating on the peninsula. The report was provided under an
information agreement made after the Soviet nuclear accident at
Chernobyl.
   The April 26, 1986, explosion at the No. 4 reactor of the nuclear
plant in the Soviet Ukraine was the world's worst atomic accident.
Two workers died of burns they suffered in the explosion, 28 died
shortly after the accident from radiation exposure, and one died of
a heart attack while fighting the fire.
   The accident touched off angry protests from the Soviets' Western
neighbors, because the first report came from Swedish officials
after high levels of radiation discovered there.
   Norwegian Northern Defense Command spokesman Geir Anda said
authorities have nothing to indicate the cloud ``is radioactive.
From the information I have, it must have come from an area at sea,
possibly north of Noveya Zemlya island.''
   The island is north of the Soviet Arctic port of Murmansk.
   Torbjorn Norendal of the Norwegian Foreign Ministry said, ``We
contacted the Soviets about this through our embassy in Moscow this
afternoon, to ask what was going on. The Soviets say nothing strange
has happened in their territory.''
   In the Soviet Union, Olga Belikova of the Northwest Agency quoted
Murmansk civil defense official Nikolai Sklyar as saying radiation
levels in Murmansk were normal and that no accidents had been
reported at nuclear sites in the region. The Northwest Agency is an
independent organization based in Leningrad.
   Interfax, the Soviet news agency affiliated with state-run Radio
Moscow, recently reported that millions of dead starfish and
mollusks had washed ashore from the Barents Sea. The agency quoted a
Soviet laboratory as saying radiation was not the cause.

^Experts Say Pregnant Women Can Gain Weight Safely, Don`t Need
Vitamins</NOTE>
<NOTE>Eds: For Release After 6p.m. EDT. Time set by source.</NOTE>

   Pregnant women who eat balanced diets don't
need extra vitamins and can safely gain more weight than previously
believed, according to guidelines released Wednesday by the
Institute of Medicine.
   The guidelines, based on a review of studies on nutrition, weight
gain and pregnancy, said the average woman who gains 25 to 35 pounds
during pregnancy is more apt to produce a healthy, normal-weight
baby. The study said also that, with few exceptions, vitamins and
other food supplements are of no value in pregnancy.
   In effect, said Lindsay Allen, a professor of nutrition at the
University of Connecticut, the study committee concluded that Mother
Nature may know best.
   ``Women, when they are not told to restrict their diet during
pregnancy, normally gain this amount of weight (25 to 35 pounds),''
said Ms. Allen, who was a chairman of a study subcommittee. ``What
we are doing is recognizing that dietary restriction in pregnancy is
not a good idea. Normal weight gain is better.''
   ``Evidence that the committee reviewed is the reported experience
of large groups of women,'' said Dr. Roy M. Pitkin, a UCLA
obstetrician who chaired the study committee. ``In a sense, this
brings health recommendations in line with what is actually
happening.''
   Officials in the nutritional supplement industry were uick to
dispute the committee findings that said vitamin pills were of no
value in pregnancy.
   ``This outrageously anti-health report potentially dooms
thousands of children to an early death or at best substantial
disability due to serious birth defects,'' J.B. Cordaro, president
of the Council for Responsible Nutrition, a vitamin industry
organization, said in a statement. ``This report is a recipe for
risk and the people who prepared the report must be held accountable
for any potential harm which may come from following their advice.''
   Cordaro cited studies that showed some nutrients, such as folic
acid, may reduce the risk of spina bifida and other neural tube
birth defects.
   Ms. Allen said, however, that the committee found earlier studies
to be inconclusive. Furthermore, she said, the amount of nutrient
sufficient to affect birth defect rates would be consumed in a
normal, balanced diet.
   Weight gain in pregnancy has been a major issue in medicine since
the 19th century, when physicians believed overeating led to large
babies and difficult labors. In recent years, most doctors have
followed guidelines established in 1970 by the National Research
Council that advised women to gain no more than 25 pounds during
pregnancy.
   But Ms. Allen, who gained just over 30 pounds during her own
recent pregnancy, said members of her committee studied new
statistical data that shows ``women can gain more weight and have
babies who are bigger and healthier at birth. They used this new
supporting evidence to say that weight gain should be higher than
recommended previously.''
   The report said weight gain during pregnancy should be evaluated
on an individual basis, considering the woman's height and body
type. Tall, underweight women, the study said, should gain between
28 and 40 pounds during pregnancy, while obese women should gain
only about 15 pounds. Ms. Allen said this follows a weight gain
pattern that women seen to follow naturally.
   How fast pregnant women gain weight is important. The committee
said a gain of one pound a week is best during the second and third
trimesters of pregnancy for the average woman, while overweight
women should gain at half that rate.
   ``A smooth, steady weight gain usually is an indication of an
increase in lean and fat,'' a committee statement said. ``Sudden or
erratic gain may indicate fluid retention, a possible signal of
toxemia or other problems.''
   For normal women eating balanced diets, Ms. Allen said vitamin
pills and other food supplements are not needed and could even be
hazardous.
   ``We find it irresponsible to suggest that supplements are needed
when we can't find any evidence that women taking healthy balanced
diets will gain any benefit from them whatsoever,'' she said.
``We've done a very thorough search of the literature and the data
are just not there to make a case that all women need the
supplementation of nutrients.''
   An exception is for iron pills.
   ``Supplements of 30 milligrams of ferrous iron are recommended
daily during the second and third trimesters'' for the general
population of pregnant women, the study said.
   But Ms. Allen said that even iron supplements should be used with
caution since dosages above 30 milligrams interfere with the
absorption of other essential nutrients. And Pitkin said that iron
pills during the first trimester of pregnancy can aggravate nausea.
   Ms. Allen said an excess intake of some other nutrients, such as
vitamin A, could adversely affect fetal development.
   As with weight gain, the use of supplements should be evaluated
on a case-by-case basis, the committee said.
   Ms. Allen said added nutrients may be appropriate for women who
do not eat a balanced diet, or who are carrying more than one baby,
or for women at higher risk because of tobacco, alcohol or drug
abuse.
   Ironically, the study was released a short time after Ms. Allen
and her husband became parents.
   ``I gained 31 pounds _ well within the guidelines,'' she said.
   The study was organized by the National Research Council for the
Institute of Medicine. Both are organizations affiliated with the
National Academy of Sciences, a private organization chartered by
Congress to advise on scientific issues.

   A top Soviet trade official made it clear
Wednesday that once the U.S.-Soviet trade agreement wins final
approval in Congress his country will be looking for U.S. loans to
help the troubled Soviet economy.
   Yuri N. Chumakov, deputy minister of foreign economic relations,
said West European countries and Canada already were offering such
loans and loan guarantees to make sales in the Soviet Union. The
government of President Mikhail Gorbachev would expect the same from
the United States, he said.
   ``The United States is our greatest food supplier. We have been
paying with cash,'' Chumakov told a gathering of U.S. businessmen.
``We have the right to expect in this hard period to receive certain
credits in order to withstand the pressure.''
   Chumakov's remarks referred to the turmoil facing the Soviet
economy, which is plagued by food shortages, sagging production and
inflation as it attempts to move from a centrally planned system to
one based on free markets.
   The United States currently is blocked from extending loan relief
to the Soviets by the same law which keeps tariffs at high levels on
Soviet exports to this country.
   The 1974 Jackson-Vanik provision says the Soviets cannot qualify
for the most favorable tariffs or for U.S. government loans until a
trade agreement is completed and the president certifies that the
Soviet Union allows free emigration.
   Bush has said he will send the trade agreement to Congress along
with a presidential request for favored trade status once the Soviet
legislature passes an emigration measure, now expected this fall.
   Under the Jackson-Vanik provision, if Congress agrees with the
president's recommendations, it would clear the way for millions of
dollars in credit from U.S. agencies which promote export sales by
American farmers and corporations.
   The agencies involved include the Export-Import Bank, which deals
with sales of U.S. industrial products, and the Commodity Credit
Corporation, which promotes U.S. farm sales.
   Chumakov's appearance before of a group of U.S. corporate
officials interested in doing business in the Soviet Union was part
of an orchestrated effort on the part of the Soviets to attract
Western investment and technology. Chumakov was the leader of the
Soviet team which negotiated the new trade agreement.
   Asked if he thought it was realistic to be seeking additional
loans from the West at a time when the Soviets are falling behind in
repaying loans they have already received, Chumakov replied, ``One
seeks credit not when he is well-off, but when he is on hard times.''
   Chumakov predicted Gorbachev's perestroika program for reforming
the Soviet economy would succeed although he conceded ``we have
already had a few mistakes (in implementation). These are
inevitable.''
   Chumakov said there was no ulterior motive in the decision by the
Supreme Soviet to put off until the fall consideration of a law
liberalizing emigration policies, saying it had fallen victim to
time constraints caused by the need to consider emergency economic
legislation.
   The delay was seen by the Bush administration as a plus, giving
Gorbachev more time to craft a compromise on the question of
Lithuanian independence, an issue that threatens congressional
approval of the trade pact.
   Chumakov called the trade agreement a critical first step to
ending nearly 50 years of commercial cold war between the two
nations. He said it would lead to expanded opportunities in a number
of areas, including space, telecommunications and aviation.
   He suggested that American companies should consider a Soviet
offer to launch U.S. commercial satellites on Soviet rockets.
   ``We have a lot of rockets free now from military applications,''
he said. ``Why should we throw them away and lose money on them.''

   The two survivors of a four-way
Democratic primary opened their runoff campaigns Wednesday, each
accusing the other of being too stodgy for the New South.
   Teachers' lobbyist Paul Hubbert and Attorney General Don
Siegelman will compete June 26 in a runoff to determine who will
challenge Republican Gov. Guy Hunt in the fall.
   Hunt, Alabama's first Republican governor this century, won GOP
renomination Tuesday in a landslide. Also winning renomination
easily was Democratic U.S. Sen. Howell Heflin, who faces Republican
nominee Bill Cabaniss in November.
   The Democratic primary for governor was a four-way fight until
Hubbert and Siegelman pulled away. Former Gov. Fob James finished
third and declined to endorse either of the top two candidates. U.S.
Rep. Ronnie Flippo ran fourth and also intends to stay neutral, his
campaign treasurer said.
   Hubbert, 54, the executive director of the Alabama Education
Association, said he was the only progressive candidate in the race
and questioned Siegelman's ability to push through a promised state
lottery bill.
   Siegelman, 44, depicted Hubbert as a ``special interest
lobbyist'' who has not worked for the state's best interests.
   ``The issue in this campaign is not whether Alabama should move
into the New South. Of course it should,'' said Siegelman. ``The
issue is who is best able to lead our state into the New South.''
   Virtually complete but unofficial returns showed Hubbert with
229,589 votes, or 32 percent, Siegelman with 179,658, or 25 percent,
James with 158,766, or 22 percent, and Flippo with 124,344, or 17
percent. Two other candidates split the rest.

   The Senate Agriculture Committee endorsed
legislation Wednesday to prohibit chemical companies from selling
pesticides abroad that are considered too dangerous to be used here.
   ``Because the Food and Drug Administration waives through
virtually all imported food without inspection, these chemicals
often end up on America's dinner tables,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy,
D-Vt., the committee chairman.
   About 25 percent of the fruits and vegetables consumed in the
United States come from abroad.
   Leahy and other Democrats on the panel said the bill was designed
not only to protect consumers from health hazards associated with
certain agricultural chemicals but to protect the American farmer
from unfair foreign competition.
   ``Foreign farmers are able to use made-in-the-USA chemicals that
our farmers cannot,'' said Leahy. ``We effectively penalize U.S.
farmers and growers for using safe pesticides and obeying the law.''
   But Republicans on the committee said the bill penalizes American
chemical manufacturers by stopping them from making a product that
foreign competitors can make and sell.
   ``If we phase companies out, it would take other companies very
little time to gear up,'' said Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo.
   The bill, which passed on a voice vote, will be inserted in the
Senate version of the 1990 farm bill.
   The bill would also disallow imports of foods treated with
pesticides outlawed in the United States.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, of Indiana, the ranking Republican on the
panel, said he did not believe the legislation belonged in the farm
bill and would argue his case on the floor.
   Congress passes a farm bill every five years to regulate
agriculture policy. Both the House and Senate agriculture committees
have more work to do on their bills before the full bodies can begin
debate.

<HEAD>Report: De Klerk to Lift State of Emergency on Thursday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk is
likely to lift the 4-year-old state of emergency on Thursday,
according to a report by the independent South African Press
Association.
   The news agency, in a report Wednesday that did not cite sources,
said de Klerk was expected to announce his plans when he addresses
Parliament in Cape Town on Thursday afternoon.
   If de Klerk ends the emergency, it would remove a major obstacle
to black-white negotiations on a new constitution. De Klerk says he
wants the document to allow the country's 28 million blacks to share
power with the 5 million whites.
   Presidential spokesman Kobie Pieterse said the report by the
South African Press Association was ``purely speculation.'' He
confirmed de Klerk was to make a previously unannounced speech to
Parliament, but declined to divulge the contents.
   The African National Congress and other leading anti-apartheid
groups have said the repeal of the emergency is a precondition for
full-scale negotiations.
   The emergency laws, which include some of the harshest measures
ever imposed by South Africa's white rulers, must be renewed by
midnight Friday if they are to remain in effect.
   De Klerk met Wednesday with his Cabinet, and they were expected
to make a final decision on whether to lift or extend the emergency.
Pieterse declined to discuss details of the Cabinet talks.
   De Klerk has eased some of the emergency rules, but among those
remaining in effect are that police can detain people without charge
indefinitely.
   Police also can still declare an ``unrest area'' and order all
people, including journalists, to leave. They can conduct searches
and seize materials without a warrant, and they cannot be prosecuted
for their actions under the emergency if they act ``in good faith.''
   De Klerk has said he wants to lift the emergency but will not do
so until authorities are confident they can control violence that
claimed more than 500 black lives in the first three months of this
year.
   Leading newspapers and political analysts have been virtually
unanimous in predicting the relaxation or lifting of emergency rules.
   ``I only hope that the government will see the necessity of
lifting the state of emergency,'' ANC leader Nelson Mandela said
last week before departing on a six-week tour of Europe, North
America and Africa. ``It has been absolutely ineffective.''
   The wideranging emergency rules initially banned most forms of
peaceful protest and made it illegal to call for boycotts or foreign
sanctions, to seek to undermine the security forces or to report on
police actions or unrest without permission.
   More than 30,000 activists, almost all of them black, have been
detained without trial for varying lengths of time during the
emergency. Others went into hiding.
   Dozens of opposition groups were banned and several
anti-apartheid newspapers were shut down temporarily. Police
repeatedly raided black trade union offices and broke up political
meetings and demonstrations in black townships and on university
campuses.
   De Klerk has nullified some of the restrictions as part of a
series of reforms implemented since he assumed power last August. He
also has released scores of detainees and long-term political
prisoners.
   About 300 activists currently are in jail under the emergency
regulations, according to the Human Rights Commission, a private
group.
   An estimated 6,000 blacks have died in the past four years, most
of them in black-on-black violence in the southeastern province of
Natal. But scores have been killed in clashes with police, including
more than 30 deaths in recent months.
   Existing security laws permit detention without trial, allow the
government to place people under tight restrictions, such as house
arrest, and provide authority to ban peaceful meetings and
demonstrations.
   De Klerk's predecessor, P.W. Botha, declared the nationwide
emergency June 12, 1986, in a bid to quell mounting black unrest.
   The action unleashed a storm of protest both inside South Africa
and abroad. The South African currency fell sharply. Foreign
investors grew nervous and many subsequently withdrew. Also, efforts
to impose economic sanctions against South Africa gained momentum.

   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
Wednesday that White House aide Ron Kaufman attended the state
Democratic convention in Massachusetts as a commentator, not as a
political saboteur.
   Massachusetts Democrats have accused Kaufman of orchestrating a
police picket that created a four-hour delay in the start of the
convention on Saturday in Springfield, Mass. Kaufman denied
involvement with the picket.
   ``Kaufman says it's not true,'' Fitzwater said. ``That's about
all we know about it. He was serving as a commentator to some media
outlets in the Boston area.''
   Fitzwater said President Bush was aware of the controversy and
that Kaufman had been questioned about the events. No further White
House inquiry was planned, he said.
   Republicans in Massachusetts are hoping to capitalize on a
slumping economy, proposed tax increases and a state budget crisis
to capture the governor's office for the first time since 1970.
Democratic Gov. Michael Dukakis is not seeking re-election.
   It was Kaufman who arranged for Bush to cruise polluted Boston
Harbor as a way of attacking Dukakis' environmental record during
the 1988 presidential campaign. Kaufman also arranged for Bush to
come to Boston and accept the endorsement of the Boston Police
Patrolmen's Association.
   The Springfield police union, which conducted the picketing last
Saturday, also endorsed Bush.
   The state Democratic Party has filed a civil suit against the
Springfield police union, and party officials said they planned to
amend the suit to include Kaufman.
   The Democrats claim the protest outside the Springfield Civic
Center violated the delegates' rights to gather for a political
assembly.
   Kaufman did not immediately return a phone call to his office for
comment.

   Two major manufacturers of hair dryers have
eliminated the danger of electrocution when their products fall into
water, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said Wednesday.
   The new hair dryers solve a problem which has plagued the
industry since the early 1980s when an estimated 17 electrocutions
annually were caused by hand-held hair dryers falling into tubs and
other water, the commission said.
   Approximately 10 of these deaths were to children under 10 years
of age, the agency said.
   ``The problem with this product in particular is that it is used
in the bathroom'' near water, said commission spokesman Dan Rumelt.
   ``You've got people that are drying their hair that have just
come out of the shower who've got wet feet, hands and hair,'' said
Dick Bruno, vice president of marketing for Windmere Corp. of Miami,
the nation's largest hair dryer manufacturer.
   ``We wanted to take a position of providing the technology that
was available,'' he added.
   Windmere's new Guardian ESP hair dryers and curling iron and
brush incorporate the new safety feature. The ``Classics Protection
Plus'' hair dryer made by Conair Corp. of Stamford, Conn. also
includes the new safety feature.
   The new dryers have rectangular-shaped plugs with a reset button
at the end of the cords.
   A device called an appliance leakage current interrupter is built
into the plug. This detects any change in the electric current in
the dryer within a fraction of a second and shuts the appliance off.
   ``Consumers should look for hair dryers with this feature
together with the certification mark of a recognized testing
laboratory,'' said Commission Chairwoman Jacqueline Jones-Smith.
   ``We want to encourage companies to build safety into their
products,'' added Jones-Smith.
   The new products offer protection against electrocution whether
their switches are in the ``on'' or ``off'' position.
   Hair dryers manufactured since Oct. 1, 1987 need only protect
against electrocution if they fall into water with the switch in the
``off'' position. The new dryers meet a new voluntary safety
standard that becomes effective Jan. 1, 1991.
   Between 16 million and 20 million hair dryers are sold in the
United States annually, according to Bruno.
   David Schmeltzer, the head of the commission's compliance
division, estimated there are still some 80 million hair dryers in
the hands of consumers that pose a danger of electrocution because
they don't meet the 1987 standard.
   Despite the product improvements, the commission additionally
warned consumers that ``electricity and water are a potentially
deadly combination, and in their presence children should always be
supervised.''

   Columbia will have to be returned to
a hangar to repair a fuel leak, indefinitely delaying the launch of
the shuttle and its $1.5 million Astro observatory, NASA said
Wednesday.
   The announcement came after a hydrogen leak reappeared during a
test.
   ``Unfortunately, we don't like what we found,'' launch director
Bob Sieck said. ``It's good news, bad news. It's good that we found
it, and it's unfortunate that it's going to be an impact to fix it.''
   Wednesday's test, in which liquid hydrogen was pumped into
Columbia, confirmed the leak in a tight cavity between two metal
plates that connect the orbiter and external tank, Sieck said.
   ``In order to fix anything in this area, we're going to have to
de-mate the orbiter from the tank'' in the hangar, he said. ``We do
know the leak is temperature-dependent, which is going to make it
difficult to pin down once we do get access to this area.''
   Sieck declined to estimate when Columbia might be able to lift
off. Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
have said it will take about a month to return the shuttle to the
hangar and perform repairs.
   Columbia's move will take place sometime next week, he said.
Preparations for Atlantis' secret military flight in July would
continue as planned, he added.
   Shuttles have been moved from the launch pad back to the hangar
twice because of mechanical failures and another time because of
payload problems.
   About 6 percent of Columbia's external tank was filled for
Wednesday's test with liquid hydrogen chilled to minus 420 degrees.
As the fuel flowed through the orbiter into the external fuel tank,
sensors detected buildups of hydrogen in the aft engine compartment
and between the two metal plates.
   The exact location and nature of the leak were not immediately
known, Sieck said. Further checks were planned at the launch pad.
   ``We think what we're going to find in this when we finally nail
this down is it's going to be something in the hardware that reacted
to the cryogenic (extremely cold) conditions,'' he said. ``It's
going to be a unique thing ... it's going to be one of these new
things that pop up in a complex system.''
   The suspected area from the start has been a 17-inch-diameter
valve in a pipe that runs through both plates. Tests with helium at
room temperature last week were unsuccessful.
   The external tank was drained following the 2{-hour test.
   Last week's launch attempt was scrubbed when the leak was
discovered as Columbia was being loaded with more than a
half-million gallons of combustible liquid hydrogen and liquid
oxygen. The mission already was two weeks late because of cooling
system repairs.
   The Astro mission is one of six remaining shuttle flights
scheduled for 1990. It appears likely one of the missions will be
pushed into next year as a result of Columbia's problems.

<TEXT>
   Republican Gov. Terry Branstad and his
newly annoited Democratic challenger, Don Avenson, opened their
general election contest Wednesday with a preview of what could
become a nasty fight over abortion.
   Branstad immediately dismissed Avenson's campaign _ supported
strongly by abortion rights advocates _ as a ``typical
special-interest'' effort similar to ones run by Democrats he has
beaten in the past.
   And Avenson, the speaker of the Iowa House, joined his vanquished
Democratic rivals in vowing to oust Branstad.
   ``The winds of change are blowing in Iowa and Terry Branstad
better start watching the want ads,'' Avenson said. ``It's our
turn.''
   Avenson's win was solid, if not lopsided, in a record turnout of
about 200,000 voters. His primary campaign had a solid core of
backing from unions, teachers and feminists.
   ``You have nominated yourself a tiger, a tiger for the ordinary
people,'' Avenson told cheering supporters as he claimed victory.
   Avenson built an 7 percent edge over Attorney General Tom Miller,
but former banker John Chrystal also fared well, cutting into
Avenson's pro-choice support.
   With all of the state's 2,567 precincts reporting, Avenson had
78,783 votes, or 39 percent, to 63,154, or 32 percent, for Attorney
General Tom Miller and 52,039, or 26 percent, for former banker John
Chrystal.
   Abortion was the major issue in the Democratic campaign. Both
Avenson and Chrystal supported a woman's right to an abortion, but
abortion rights groups endorsed Avenson and poured strong support
into his campaign. Miller opposes abortion.
   ``I think the fact that we offered Iowans a choice made the
difference,'' Avenson said.

   President Bush is ``very upset'' that a Secret
Service agent shoved a top White House adviser as Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev left San Francisco, a spokesman said Wednesday.
   Condoleezza Rice, Bush's senior adviser on Soviet affairs and the
highest ranking black woman at the White House, was among the VIPs
at an airport reception line at Gorbachev's departure when she was
singled out by a Secret Service agent.
   The unidentified agent reportedly ordered her to stay behind
security barricades and then shoved her, even though she identified
herself as a member of the official White House party.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the agent
``pushed Conde Rice. Simple as that.''
   Speaking to a roomful of reporters, Fitzwater added, ``You've all
had it happen to you 100 times.''
   ``The president is aware of it, he's very upset about it _ most
unfortunate,'' Fitzwater said.
   There was no explanation for the incident.
   ``We have no idea what the factors were,'' Fitzwater said.
   Allan Cramer, a Secret Service spokesman, said, ``We're looking
into it now. It's an ongoing investigation.''
   He said he did not know what happened.
   ``As long as it's an ongoing investigation,'' he added, ``we
wouldn't be commenting on it.''
   Asked if Secret Service agents are authorized to shove people, he
snapped, ``What kind of question is that? _ That's like, have you
stopped beating your wife?''
   Calls to Ms. Rice's office were referred to the White House press
office.

   Sen. Max Baucus and his Democratic
supporters say they're bracing for an avalanche of Republican cash
in this fall's general election battle with Lt. Gov. Allen Kolstad.
   But Baucus, a two-term Democrat who was nominated for re-election
Tuesday, has his own pile of campaign cash, which Republicans are
trying to turn into a liability rather than an asset.
   ``Senator Baucus will learn the hard way that Montana cannot be
bought with an out-of-state war chest,'' said Montana GOP Chairman
Barbara Campbell. ``Does he need $2 million to get re-elected to a
job he's held for 12 years? That says he's very weak.''
   Baucus coasted past two primary opponents Tuesday with 83 percent
of the Democratic vote, while Kolstad won a four-man race with 43
percent of the GOP vote.
   Kolstad and the Republicans are hoping for a repeat of 1988, when
upstart Republican Conrad Burns pulled off an upset victory over
two-term incumbent Democratic Sen. John Melcher.
   Kolstad promised Wednesday to run an above-board campaign
focusing on economic issues and refraining from personal attacks.
But Democratic Party Chairman Bruce Nelson said he expects Kolstad
to go on the offensive against Baucus.
   ``The pattern that Republicans set two years ago of a relentless
negative attack is the same thing that they will do this year,'' he
predicted.
   Baucus already has raised more than $2 million in campaign funds,
smashing the state campaign-spending record of $1.2 million set by
Melcher in 1988.

   The Justice Department said Wednesday it
opposes a House plan backed by some federal judges to give death row
inmates more appeal rights than they now have.
   The department said also that it had ``technical problems'' with
a Senate-adopted amendment to shorten death penalty delays by
replacing state habeas corpus proceedings with a single federal
court review.
   Defendants sentenced to death sometimes use habeas corpus
hearings in attempts to win new trials or sentences. The Senate
amendment was defeated, then passed 12 hours later on May 24 as part
of a comprehensive anti-crime bill.
   The House and Senate proposals are among several under
consideration in Congress to speed up death penalty appeals while
ensuring defendants' rights.
   Deputy Assistant Attorney General Paul L. Maloney told a House
Judiciary subcommittee that the House plan would cause delays and
repetition in appeals, and that the Senate proposal contained
``defects.''
   The House plan is sponsored by Rep. Paul Kastenmeier, D-Wis.,
chairman of the Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on courts. It
would give death row inmates new appeal rights while ensuring that
their attorneys met strict experience and performance standards.
   The bill also aims to end appeals delays by restricting multiple
prisoner petitions, and establishing a one-year limit for inmates to
file for federal habeas relief.
   But Maloney said the measure ``multiplies the opportunity for
delay and abuse'' in capital cases.
   He quoted retired Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell, who said
recently that a vote for Kastenmeier's bill ``would in practical
effect be a vote to eliminate capital punishment in the United
States.''
   The bill was backed during Thursday's hearing by Joseph Lowery,
president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. He said a
broader supervisory role by the federal judiciary was needed to stop
the ``inexhaustible litany of racial discrimination cases in the
courts in the rural south.''
   The bill also has the support of several federal judges,
including Gilbert Merritt of Nashville, Tenn., chief judge of the
6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   Maloney said also that the department was not ready to support
the amendment requiring the filing of habeas corpus petitions within
60 days after final action by state courts. The amendment was
authored by Sens. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.
   The Specter-Thurmond amendment raises ``interesting
possibilities'' for reducing appeals delays ``through a stronger,
more comprehensive system of time limitation rules,'' Maloney said.
   But he added, ``We do find that there are some defects, some
technical problems if you will.'' Under questioning, he said the
amendment was still under review and he was not prepared to specify
what the problems were.

   Paraguay and Nicaragua on Wednesday
re-established diplomatic and commercial ties severed 11 years ago
following the ouster of Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza by
Sandinista guerrillas.
   Vice foreign ministers Bernardino Caballero of Paraguay and
Ernesto Leal of Nicaragua made the announcement at the annual
meeting of the Organization of American States.
   Ties were broken in 1979 after a leftist Sandinista government
took over in Nicaragua. The Sandinistas lost in elections last
February and were replaced in April by a government headed by
President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro.
   Paraguay's then-President Gen. Alfredo Stroessner granted asylum
to Somoza, who was assassinated on an Asuncion street in September
1980.
   Stroessner's nearly 35-year rightist government was toppled in a
Feb. 2, 1989, coup led by Gen. Andres Rodriguez, who three months
later won a landslide election victory.

<HEAD>New Rules May Allow Thousands of Palestinian Families to Unite</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A new policy halting the explusion of some
Palestinians in the occupied lands affects thousands who have been
separated from their families, a civil rights group said Wednesday.
   Under the government decision announced Tuesday, wives and
children of Palestinians who live in West Bank or Gaza Strip without
residency permits would be allowed to live in the occupied
territories unless there is a ``specific negative security reason''
to deny the request.
   The decision came after Israel's Association for Civil Rights
appealed the expulsions of 15 Palestinians and after U.S. criticism
that expelling women and children without such permits was dividing
Arab families.
   The new regulations say Arabs in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip will be allowed to ask for residency status for members of
their families, who can remain as ``visitors.''
   Netta Goldman, a lawyer with the Association for Civil Rights,
said the group also won a court order specifying that as visitors,
wives and children would be entitled to normal health benefits and
schooling.
   ``This affects thousands and thousands of people,'' she said.
   Under past regulations, only Palestinians who lived in the
occupied lands during a September 1967 census were automatically
eligible for residency permits.
   That did not include thousands of Palestinian women whose
families fled to Jordan when Israel seized the West Bank and Gaza in
the June 1967 Mideast war, and who later married men from the
occupied areas.
   Wives and children denied residency permits would enter the
occupied lands on three-month guest visas, then had to abandon their
families and return to Jordan for several months or stay illegally.
   According to the army, 251 Palestinians, including 88 women and
78 children, were expelled from the territories last year because
they lacked residency permits. The army has no figures for preceding
years.
   In January, the U.S. State Department questioned the expulsion
practices. Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin immediately ordered a
temporary halt to the practice and promised to review it.
   According to Rabin, 88,249 requests for family reunification have
been received since 1967, and 13,509 of those were granted.
   Palestinians activists have claimed the expulsions were part of a
strategy to force Palestinians out of the occupied lands, but
Israeli officials denied this.
   Still, the issue has been seen as part of a demographic war, with
some Palestinians trying to increase their numbers in the
territories, while Israel tried to limit the growth. About 1.7
million Arabs and 70,000 Jews live in the occupied lands.
   Palestinian activist and lawyer Jonathan Kuttab said Wednesday
the new rules were ``a positive thing'' but would still leave tens
of thousands of Palestinians as exiles.
   He said the decision was ``an attempt to reduce the damage from
the glaring discrimination ... of allowing total strangers like
Soviet Jews to come here while denying the basic rights of
Palestinians, who have family and roots here, to come back to their
land.''

   Author James Michener warned three
young men that bigotry ``will corrode your soul and imperil your
adult lives'' and offered to help them fulfill an unusual sentence
for anti-Semitic vandalism.
   Michener wrote to the men after learning that a judge had ordered
them to learn about the Holocaust _ the systematic destruction of 6
million Jews by the Nazis before and during World War II.
   Part of their assignment: reading a chapter from Michener's book,
``Poland.''
   The letter was sent through the judge, John Carey, who said
Wednesday he was moved that ``so eminent a scholar and author''
would take a ``sympathetic interest'' in the men's future.
   In his letter dated May 30, Michener said he was interested in
their case because, as an orphan, ``race and inheritance have been
of crucial importance to me.''
   ``Fellows, what you're doing is wrong,'' Michener wrote of their
bigotry. ``You will stain yourselves if you follow that route. Get
off that doomed train right now. ...
   ``Grab at this chance to get home free and please, please drop
your racial attitudes, for if you persist in them you will corrode
your soul and imperil your adult lives.''
   He offered to help the men understand the book chapter, titled
``The Terror,'' which deals with the Nazi concentration camp
Majdanek in Poland.
   ``I could have no assignment more important than to help you
retreat from what has been a fearfully wrong start,'' wrote
Michener, the author of numerous books, including ``Chesapeake,''
``The Drifters,'' ``The Source'' and the Pulitzer Prize-winning
``Tales of the South Pacific.''
   The three men will be quizzed on the Holocaust on June 25 by
three judges: one Jewish, one Catholic and Carey, who's Protestant.
   Carey, who sits in Westchester County Court, told the men in
handing down his sentence that he wanted to educate them, not punish
them.
   Michael Morano, 18, Michael Venturino, 18, and Neville Anthony
Mason, 20, were charged with spray-painting swastikas and writing
the words ``Jew'' and ``Hitler is Back'' on the walls of Ardsley
High School on June 20, 1989.
   Morano pleaded guilty to criminal mischief in the third degree, a
felony, and admitted that he had done the actual spray-painting. The
other two pleaded guilty to misdemeanors.
   Referring to his orphan start in life, Michener wrote: ``I have
no idea who my parents were. I could have been Jewish, I could be
part Negro. I could easily have been born Catholic or Baptist. But
as a spiritually free man I have made my way in the world as
honorably as I could.''
   He also noted that his wife was of Japanese extraction and
therefore his family was ``intimately concerned with the problems of
race and tolerance between groups. We have striven to prevent
incidents like the unfortunate one in which you became involved,
because we know how much damage such misbehavior can cause.''

   Jesse Jackson urged Mayor Marion Barry on
Wednesday to work out a plea bargain in his drug and perjury case
and declare he won't run for re-election.
   The city ``should be spared'' a racially divisive trial and
campaign, Jackson said.
   He made his comments as Barry lawyer R. Kenneth Mundy disclosed
he had talked with Jackson about the mayor's criminal trial. The
case went through a third day of jury selection with 16 prospective
jurors sent into a jury pool that now numbers 25.
   Talk of a possible plea bargain dominated public discussion of
the trial, as various figures hinted they were involved or declared
they weren't.
   Walter Fauntroy, Washington's delegate in Congress and a
candidate to succeed Barry as mayor, called a news conference to
remind reporters he had earlier appealed to Barry and prosecutors to
``spare the city and the nation the agony of a trial'' and to say he
had concluded ``that appeal has not fallen on deaf ears.''
   At the White House, however, presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said there was ``no basis'' to a report that Jackson,
Fauntroy and other Democrats had called administration officials
asking them to encourage prosecutors to soften terms for a guilty
plea.
   Mundy said, ``I have spoken to Reverend Jackson.'' But he shed no
light on the question of a possible role for Jackson in any plea
bargain negotiations with the government.
   No discussions on a possible guilty plea were under way, Mundy
said. He declined to answer whether that subject had come up in the
conversation with Jackson. Asked whether he would rule out such
talks with the prosecution, Mundy said he never says ``anything in
absolutes.''
   Various reports have indicated that negotiations between Mundy
and the U.S. attorney's office in Washington reached an impasse
several days ago over the government's insistence that the mayor
plead guilty to one of the three felony perjury counts against him.
   Barry also faces 10 misdemeanor charges of drug possession and
one of conspiracy.
   Jackson moved to Washington last year amid speculation he had his
eye on the mayor's office, but he has since said he will not be a
candidate in the November election. Barry has not formally announced
for a fourth four-year term but had made numerous campaign-style
appearances, and aides say he is likely to run.
   In an interview on WUSA-TV, Jackson expressed hope that the mayor
``would determine he would not run again ... and would really
challenge the Justice Department to work out some settlement
process.''
   ``There's enough pain to go around,'' he said.
   ``If all this laundry comes out'' in a trial it ``will be a long
and ugly and national and divisive campaign,'' Jackson said.
   ``We should be spared ... all of this,'' he added. It is ``very
Republican-Democrat, it's very white-black, it's very nasty.''
   Settling the case now would allow ``rebuilding a lot of fractures
and wounds in this city that's now pouring over into the entire
country,'' said Jackson.
   Jackson said a trial would embarrass the Justice Department,
considering ``the amount of time and money spent'' by the government
in pursuing Barry and ``the horror stories we now hear about the
FBI's role.'' The bureau's sting operation resulted in a videotape
of Barry allegedly smoking crack cocaine and is the centerpiece of
the government's case.
   ``They used more than the amount of money that they would spend
on a serial killer or an S&amp;L thief that threatens to bankrupt the
whole country,'' said Jackson.
   Jackson said his sense is that Barry ``feels if it goes the
complete judicial process that he will emerge with some strength and
a public airing of it. But he would rather spare the people of this
long, drawn-out process as well as his family.
   ``My sense is that he would choose publicly not to run again,
that he would be interested in serving out his term and obviously
not going to jail and continuing his recovery process.''
   Barry spent seven weeks in substance abuse recovery centers
following his Jan. 18 arrest at the Vista Hotel.
   On Tuesday, nine prospective jurors were sent into a pool from
which a panel of 12 jurors and six alternates will be selected for
the Barry case.
   Among the 16 sent into the pool Wednesday was a man who expressed
concern that his name would become known and that he might be
subject to threats if he sat on the Barry jury.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Declares Rap Album Obscene</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TRACY FIELDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The hot-selling 2 Live Crew rap
album ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be'' was declared obscene Wednesday
by a federal judge who cited its graphic sexual lyrics.
   U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez agreed with the Broward County
Sheriff's Department that the album violates community obscenity
standards.
   ``It is an appeal to `dirty' thoughts and the loins, not to the
intellect and the mind,'' Gonzalez wrote in his opinion, which was
read to a packed courtroom that included the rap group's members.
   The Miami-based group sued after deputies threatened shopkeepers
with arrest if they continued selling the album.
   The group's attorney, Bruce Rogow, said he'd appeal the ruling,
but predicted album sales, which are approaching 2 million, would
get a boost from the decision.
   ``I think the demand for the record is going to be
extraordinary,'' Rogow said, quoting a newspaper columnist who
wrote: ``People will crawl naked over broken glass to get what
someone tells them they're not supposed to.''
   Gonzalez said the recording met the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court test
for obscenity, as set by local community standards, and cited state
laws in his ruling.
   ``Florida has declared obscenity a crime,'' he wrote. ``To
repeat, violation of the law against obscenity is as much against
the law as assault, rape, kidnapping, robbery or any other form of
behavior which the Legislature has declared criminal.''
   The judge, who listened to the album at a hearing in mid-May and
heard arguments from witnesses and attorneys, did rebuke the
sheriff's office for improper prior restraint of free speech. He
said deputies shouldn't have approached retailers until the material
had been declared obscene.
   Sheriff Nick Navarro said his department hasn't made any arrests
for selling the album, which has virtually disappeared from stores
countywide.
   ``We will enforce the laws,'' Navarro said. ``I intend to follow
a very prudent and reasonable line.''
   2 Live Crew's leader, Luther Campbell, said the obscenity ruling
wouldn't change the group's musical style or lyrics.
   ``We'll keep making the same music. We probably won't sell no
records in Broward County,'' he said outside the courthouse.
   During the May hearing, Rogow played the double album for the
judge and a packed courtroom. He also showed X-rated videotapes and
displayed pornographic magazines obtained locally as evidence of the
community's standards.
   Two music critics and a sociologist appeared as expert witnesses,
testifying about the recording's artistic, political and literary
worth.
   Sheriff's department lawyer John Jolly brought no experts.
   ``The tape speaks for itself,'' he said before the trial.
   In the 1973 case of Miller vs. California, the U.S. Supreme Court
established guidelines for finding material obscene.
   The justices ruled that the material must, under the contemporary
standards of individual communities, describe sexual conduct in a
patently offensive way, appeal to the prurient interest, and lack
serious artistic, literary or political value.

<HEAD>Feds: Pursuing Alien Smuggling Charges Against Noriega</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS final graf with two grafs to clarify status of other
aliens caught in piepline</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. immigration investigators say they expect
Manuel Noriega to be charged with being at the center of the largest
alien-smuggling ring ever uncovered.
   Tens of thousands of Chinese, Cubans and other immigrants paid
millions of dollars to Panamanian officials to use that nation as an
illegal gateway to the United States and Canada, said Robert Harris,
chief criminal investigator for the Immigration and Naturalization
Service here.
   The ring started as early as 1980, and about 4,000 Cubans used it
to enter this country at Miami International Airport alone during
the past seven years, authorities said. Sixteen thousand people were
caught ``in the pipeline'' when the United States invaded Panama in
December, said Robert Penland, who recently retired as assistant INS
commissioner for anti-smuggling.
   ``Nobody ever operated an alien-smuggling operation to the extent
of Panama,'' Harris said. ``It was operated by the government, and
it was a well-organized, well-run operation.''
   He said immigration officials could not recall any such
state-operated alien trade.
   There is already enough evidence to seek indictments, Harris
said, but INS and federal prosecutors decided to move cautiously
because of the former Panamanian dictator's protracted
drug-smuggling case, due to go to trial next year.
   ``We don't want to interfere with the current prosecution effort
by the United States attorney,'' he said recently. Any indictment
``could be after the trial.''
   In response to Harris' comments, U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen
issued a statement Wednesday saying: ``There is no indictment
currently planned or contemplated against General Manuel A. Noriega
in this district that includes any allegations of alien smuggling.''
   The allegations became public during a January bond hearing for a
Noriega co-defendant, pilot Eduardo Pardo, when federal prosecutors
said Noriega and Pardo helped smuggle aliens into the country.
   Noriega attorney Frank Rubino said he was surprised by the
investigation, and questioned the U.S. right to prosecute his client
in such a case.
   ``The United States may like to police the world ... but they've
just gone a step too far,'' Rubino said. ``What may have occurred
internally in the country of Panama is not within U.S.
jurisdiction.''
   The smuggling operation not only involved Noriega and top
intelligence officials, but also Panama's consulates, the Cuban
government, private attorneys and U.S.-based smugglers,
investigators say.
   Panamanian officials, acting directly or through private attorney
middlemen, charged from $10,000 up to $20,000 for visas into Panama,
Harris said. He said the highest prices were paid by refugees from
China, while those from Cuba, Hong Kong and other points paid
somewhat less, Harris said.
   Cuban officials worked with Noriega on the visas to extract money
from refugees leaving that island for Panama, and Miami-based Cuban
rights groups also paid Noriega to ensure their countrymen were
cleared to travel to the United States, Harris said.
   Trusted Noriega in-laws were put in charge of two of the most
lucrative consulates, Taiwan and Hong Kong, said the investigator.
   All visa approvals had to come directly from the head of Panama's
intelligence service, Lt. Col. Rafael Cedeno, or from Noriega
himself, Harris said. Cedeno distributed a list to Panamanian
customs officials, and no one could enter the country unless they
were on it, Harris said.
   Entering Panama was only the beginning, however, Harris said.
   ``Once they arrived, they were further exploited. They would sell
them residence visas, extensions of stay _ sometimes $3,000 to stay
an extra year.''
   Maj. Felipe Camargo, who headed Panama's immigration agency for
only four months, was captured after the U.S. invasion and is one of
several former top officials to give details on how lucrative the
ring was, said Harris.
   ``In that four months, he admitted personally getting $300,000,''
said Harris. ``If he got $300,000, the higher-ups must have gotten
at least that amount.''
   All orders came directly from Noriega and Cedeno at the
Panamanian Defense Forces headquarters, the Comandancia.
   ``And the money was then passed on to the Comandancia,'' said
Harris. ``That would be Noriega, or Cedeno, or (Cedeno's
predecessor) Guillermo Wong before the October coup attempt.''
   After the invasion, the Panamanians apparently tried to destroy
all financial records, but investigators found one set of wire
transfers to Cedeno for $80,000 they believe are linked to the
alien-smuggling.
   Even when the aliens made arrangments to sneak into the United
States, they still had to pay Panamanian officials to get on
Cedeno's exit list, said Harris.
   Smuggling into the United States from Panama was accomplished in
various forms, said Harris. While Cubans could simply show up in the
United States and claim political asylum, Chinese aliens had more
difficulty.
   ``They take a different route _ they try to evade the INS through
fraudulent documents, or cross over land borders,'' he said.
   As far as the INS can tell, the new government of Panama has
stopped the alien trade into the country, officials said.
   But about 7,000 Chinese were stranded in Panama after the
invasion, so the smuggling operations out of that country continue,
even though no longer organized by the government, immigration
officials said. The 8,000 others were either in the home countries,
in third countries or were still making their way into the United
States, officials said.
   A flight of illegal Chinese immigrants from Panama was recently
intercepted in Canada, and Harris said arrests are still being made
in Miami.

<TEXT>
   Sure, Superman's super. But he's short _
even puny.
   That's the feeling of some Metropolis residents who express
concern that a 7-foot-5 statue of the Man of Steel is dwarfed by a
supermarket's 32-foot statue of a burly lumberjack.
   As the Ohio River city of 7,200 begins its four-day annual
Superman Celebration on Thursday, a move is afoot to replace the
Superman replica with a 15-foot version.
   ``I took a good, long look at it one day, and I decided we needed
a new Superman,'' said O.D. Troutman, one of six people on a
committee organized to acquire a new statue. ``We just want to get a
larger one, a better looking one and one that is better
proportionally built.''
   The current superhero was built for $1,000 four years ago, but
his stature now seems downright diminutive compared to Big John, the
statue of a lumberjack that stands at the entrance to Big John's
supermarket a few blocks from Superman's lowly brick pedestal in
front of the courthouse.
   Though he says bigger is better, Troutman isn't ready to top Big
John: ``It would be higher than the courthouse and it wouldn't blend
in with the surroundings.''
   Besides, a Superman the size of Big John would thwart
camera-toting tourists trying to snap a few photos of the kids
clambering on the Man of Steel.
   Residents would readily contribute toward a new statue, Troutman
said, explaining: ``I've had folks tell me, `If you get rid of the
statue, we will give you $100 for a new one.'''
   A new steel-and-fiberglass model could be built within three
months and have a grand unveiling at the 1991 Superman Celebration,
he said.
   The celebration has been held annually since 1979 and is expected
to draw more than the 20,000 visitors it attracted last year, said
Jenny Walters, celebration committee chairwoman.
   Metropolis _ the name of Superman's fictional hometown _ adopted
him in 1972, and the celebration honoring him with skits, picnics
and other family-oriented events gets bigger every year, so a larger
Superman is a good move, Walters said.
   But what about the old Superman?
   ``It would look good on top of our 150-foot water tower,''
Troutman said.

<TEXT>
   A welcome fit for royalty awaited Nelson Mandela as
he arrived Wednesday on the first leg of a six-week trans-Atlantic
trip aimed at persuading the West to maintain pressure on South
Africa's white rulers.
   Mandela, freed Feb. 11 after more than 27 years in prison, was
met at Orly airport by France's first lady, Danielle Mitterrand,
head of a human rights foundation that has lobbied against apartheid.
   The 71-year-old African National Congress leader later was to
attend a twilight outdoor concert in his honor at the Place du
Trocadero, across the Seine river from the Eiffel Tower, in the
company of President Francois Mitterrand.
   Highlights of the program included a rendition of ``God Bless
Africa,'' the anthem of the anti-apartheid movement, by jazz
violinist Didier Lockwood and 100 supporting violinists, and a
spiritual sung by black American opera star Grace Bumbry.
   The Culture Ministry invited the public ``to come honor the man
who embodies the hopes for the liberation of South Africa.''
   On Thursday, Mandela is to confer with Mitterrand and Premier
Michel Rocard as well as leaders of the Socialist, Communist and
neo-Gaullist parties.
   Mandela _ making his third and most extensive foreign trip since
his release from prison _ is scheduled to visit Switzerland next,
followed by West Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, Ireland
and Britain, as well as several African countries. He is due back in
South Africa on July 18, his 72nd birthday.
   He is expected to urge Western leaders to maintain existing
sanctions and embargoes on South Africa, despite the reform
initiatives of President F.W. de Klerk. De Klerk has freed several
African National Congress leaders, lifted a 30-year ban on the
guerrilla movement, and moved to dismantle several segregation laws
as prelude to proposed negotiations on a post-apartheid constitution.
   Mandela, at a news conference Tuesday in Botswana, said foreign
pressure should be maintained because de Klerk's government had not
yet addressed the back majority's basic demand of a one-person,
one-vote political system.
   However, he reaffirmed his positive attitude toward de Klerk and
hinted the president might lift the 4-year-old state of emergency
within the next few days. The emergency was imposed June 12, 1986 by
de Klerk's predecessor, P.W. Botha.
   De Klerk, intent on ending South Africa's international
isolation, visited Mitterrand and other Western Euorpean leaders
during a nine-nation, 18-day trip last month.
   Mitterrand and other heads of state told de Klerk that the status
of sanctions would be discussed at a European Community summit in
Dublin, Ireland on June 25-26.
   In South Africa, police searched two houses belonging to African
National Congress leader Nelson Mandela on Wednesday, claiming they
were seeking a murder suspect.
   Police Brig. Vic Haynes said the suspect was not connected with
the Mandela family.
   The ANC condemned the raids as ``the height of provocation'' and
demanded ``such acts of intimidation'' cease immediately.
   ANC officials said a small brick house that Mandela had rented
for 40 years was searched, along with a ranch-style house in another
section of the black township of Soweto, outside Johannesburg. A
newer mansion where the Mandelas now live was not searched.

   A car bomb explosion killed a
retired police reserve officer on Wednesday and wounded his wife and
two pedestrians, police said. The Irish Republican Army claimed
responsibility for the blast.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary identified the slain man as James
Sefton, 65, and said his wife, Ellen, was in critical condition in a
hospital.
   Two people walking along the road were also injured, the
constabulary said.
   Sefton, who retired from the police reserve three years ago, was
the fifth person killed in 11 days by the IRA.
   The IRA has made police and army members a prime target of a
20-year-old campaign against British rule in Northern Ireland. The
IRA wants to unite Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland with the
overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland.
   In Annaghmore, Catholic priest Seamus McGinley urged mourners at
the funeral of Patrick Boyle, 60, to make the father-of-five's
funeral the starting point for building a new, peaceful way of life.
   ``Forget about retaliation because retaliation brings nothing,
only violence and more violence,'' he said.
   Boyle was killed at his home near Portadown, 25 miles southwest
of Belfast, on Monday. The Ulster Volunteer Force, an illegal
Protestant organization, claimed responsibility but indicated it had
meant to kill someone else.
   Boyle's two sons were wounded by gunfire.

   A private project to improve rural
Americans' cardiovascular health resulted in an average nine-pound
loss of body fat as well as reduced cholesterol and blood pressure,
organizers said Wednesday.
   ``We're talking about an impressive improvement in the quality of
life, about people being more productive and less stressed,'' said
Bill Reger, director of Bayer Co.'s $3.3 million, two-year study.
``Our success has been phenomenal.''
   Participants were encouraged to follow a low-fat, high-fiber
diet, to exercise, and to use stress management techniques.
   Free cooking and aerobics classes were offered along with
lectures on heart disease, nutrition and weight loss. Stop-smoking
clinics also were available.
   Those in the study, which began in May 1988, had their blood
pressures, cholesterol, pulse rates and other factors checked every
three months.
   The program's final screenings were completed late last month.
Results from that screening will be distributed to the participants
beginning Thursday.
   The program, one of the first privately funded public health
education programs for rural areas, was sponsored by Bayer and its
New York-based parent company, Glenbrook Laboratories.
   Organizers chose Wellsburg, a town of about 4,000 people, about
45 miles southwest of Pittsburgh, because of its small population.
   The 517 people who went through the program from start to finish
lost an average of 8.6 pounds of body fat, Reger said. An average
5.2 pounds of that fat was converted to muscle tissue, resulting in
an average weight loss of 3.6 pounds.
   The participants also saw their cholesterol reduced from an
average reading of 220 at the start of the study to 208.
   ``The reduction may not seem to be that much at first blush,''
said Reger. ``But if you look further, the people at the most risk
were the ones who made the greatest positive changes and we're
thrilled with that.''
   Average blood pressures of those in the study dropped from an
average 132 over 81 to 126 over 78.
   ``Again, the changes may appear modest, but the people at most
risk had the biggest reductions,'' said Reger. ``Overall, people in
the program are using far fewer high blood pressure medications now
than they were two years ago.''
   West Virginia has one of the highest obesity rates in the country
at 29 percent, according to a 1988 report by the federal Centers for
Disease Control. The same study found that 27 percent of West
Virginians smoked.
   Nearly everyone in the study reported reducing their salt and fat
intake. And 57 percent of those who smoked when they started the
program have quit, Reger said.

   The Bush administration moved Wednesday to
defuse controversy over government financing of potentially
objectional art by proposing a one-year interim extension of the
National Endowment for the Arts.
   Endowment Director John E. Frohnmayer told a Senate panel he
hoped time would allow ``the temperature to go down'' on the dispute
over federal aid of allegedly obscene art.
   He urged that a 12-member advisory commission, half of it
appointed by Congress and half by the White House, be given time to
reach some recommendations about the future of the endowment and its
grant-making procedures.
   ``This problem must be solved and I pledge to you my full
attention to it,'' Frohnmayer said. ``This controversy has been
debilitating to my agency.''
   Frohnmayer appeared before a Senate appropriations subcommittee
considering the budget for the NEA. The agency's legislative
authorization is scheduled to expire at the end of this fiscal year.
   President Bush has recommended another five-year renewal, or
reauthorization, of the NEA with no restrictions on its grant-making
authority. But the NEA has drawn opposition among conservatives
because of federal grants for controversial works by the late
photographer Robert Mapplethorpe and photographer Andrews Serrano,
and congressional supporters have acknowledged it would be difficult
to win full renewal with no restrictions.
   Frohnmayer told the panel that the Bush administration continues
to prefer a five-year reauthorization of the NEA without
restrictions but would accept ``a three-year or even a one-year''
extension while awaiting the commission's recommendation.
   At the White House, deputy press secretary Alixe Glen called a
one-year extension ``the prudent thing to do.''
   ``Given the political climate, this isn't something we want to do
hastily,'' she said.
   The advisory commission met separately Wednesday for the first
time to review the agency's grant-making procedures. Its first
meeting came more than a month after it had been directed by
Congress to make a report on the NEA. Frohnmayer cited
administrative delays and urged that the commission's life also be
extended beyond its October expiration.
   Frohnmayer received a lecture from the subcommittee chairman,
Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., and Sen. James A. McClure, R-Idaho,
about the peril posed to the endowment by the controversial grants.
   Byrd said some of the subsidized works of art were ``so
repulsive'' that if viewed by the general public there would by a
far greater outcry that could force an end to the NEA altogether.
   ``It's too bad that a few little rotten apples will spoil the
barrel, but they surely will,'' Byrd said.
   McClure said he wanted to continue supporting the arts but
complained of an ``attitude out there'' among the arts community
that Congress has no business exercising control on grants.
   Frohnmayer acknowledged the controversy has damaged the NEA and
said the endowment has taken steps to ensure grants go through
careful review.
   ``I would hope we could put Mapplethorpe and Serrano behind us,
because we have really bloodied ourselves,'' he said.
   Mapplethorpe's works included homoerotic photographs and
Serrano's works included a depiction of a crucifix in urine.
   The one-year plan was decided upon at a meeting Tuesday including
White House officials and Frohnmayer as a way to head off further
restrictions on NEA.

<HEAD>Some Senators Want to End PLO Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Several senators moved Wednesday to end U.S.
talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization because of the
group's involvement in a foiled terrorist attack on Israel.
   ``The terrorist raid on Israel last week was the last straw in a
continuing pattern of unacceptable behavior by the PLO,'' said Sen.
Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn.
   Abu Abbas, a member of the PLO's executive committee, claimed
responsibility for the foiled boat attack against civilians on a
beach in Tel Aviv.
   Lieberman and three others senators _ Iowa Republican Charles
Grassley and Democrats Connie Mack of Florida and Frank Lautenberg
of New Jersey _ introduced a resolution that would force the State
Department to end talks with the PLO until it renounces terrorism
and recognizes Israel's right to exist.
   Lisa Klinghoffer, daughter of terrorist victim Leon Klinghoffer,
said a ``cold chill ran down my spine'' when she saw Abu Abbas on
television recently.
   Abbas was convicted in absentia by the Italian government of
directing the terrorist takeover of the cruise ship Achille Lauro in
the Mediterranean in 1985. Klinghoffer, confined to a wheelchair,
was shot and killed; his body dumped overboard.
   The State Department, in a report released earlier this year,
said there was no evidence that PLO officials directed terrorism,
even though there were scattered incidents of violence.
   Under existing law, the United States can't deal with the PLO if
it endorses terrorism.
   U.S. officials have said they are reviewing last week's attempted
boat attack.

Power</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal court ruling that the county Board
of Supervisors drew district boundaries to dilute Hispanic voting
strength will be appealed.
   U.S. District Judge David Kenyon ruled Monday in a voting rights
lawsuit that board members conspired to ``protect their incumbencies
and (those) of their allies'' when they redrew the county's five
voting districts in 1981.
   The board's conservative majority voted Tuesday to appeal. The
two-year legal battle over redistricting already has cost $3 million.
   Liberal supervisors dissented regarding the appeal and called for
a settlement that would expand the five-member board to offer more
representation.
   `It's time for at least nine supervisors,'' Supervisor Kenneth
Hahn said.
   Hahn left before the closed-door vote and fellow liberal Ed
Edelman abstained.
   Conservative Pete Schabarum, who is retiring, favored the appeal,
as did Mike Antonovich and Deane Dana.
   The 1988 lawsuit claimed the supervisors deliberately spread the
county's Hispanic population across several districts when they
changed voting boundaries following the 1980 federal census.
   Hispanics make up an estimated 35 percent of the county's 8.7
million people, but no Hispanic has been elected to the board since
1875.

   Chest pains that put entertainer
Michael Jackson in the hospital were caused by bruised ribs suffered
during a vigorous dance practice, his doctor said Wednesday.
   Laboratory and X-ray tests of Jackson's heart and lungs revealed
no abnormalities, said Dr. Mark Zatzkis, a cardiologist.
   Jackson complained of chest pains when he was admitted to St.
Johns Hospital and Health Center on Sunday.
   The singer-songwriter suffered from costochondritis, or cartilage
inflammation of the front part of the ribs, Zatzkis said in a
statement released by Jackson's spokesman, Bob Jones.
   Jackson should be released in about two days and then will visit
the hospital for more treatment, Jones told a news conference.
   The singer apparently suffered the injury during a two-hour solo
dance session in the bedroom of his Los Angeles home, a regular
Sunday routine.
   Jones said Jackson demands to be left alone during the workout.
   ``No one dares disturb him,'' he said.
   Jackson visited with his hospital floormate, Elizabeth Taylor,
Jones said without offering details. Miss Taylor has been at the
hospital for several weeks, recovering from a severe bout with
pneumonia.
   Jackson's brothers, Jackie, Marlon, and Randy, entered the
hospital shortly after the news conference.
   ``He's a strong person, and I know he's going to pull through,''
Jackie Jackson said.
   Hospital security guards detained a man and handed him over to
police for allegedly making threats against Jackson.
   Jacki Lee Adams, 28, was arrested after saying he was going to
kill the singer, said Sgt. John Meile.
   Adams was booked for investigation of giving false information to
a police officer and trespassing, both misdemeanors, and felony
threatening to cause bodily harm.
   It was the second arrest at the hospital involving Jackson's
stay. On Monday, a woman who claimed Jackson is the father of her
children was taken into custody by police. She allegedly violated a
court order to stay at least 500 yards from the entertainer.

   President Petar Mladenov appealed for calm

separate rallies by the governing Socialist Party _ the former
Communist Party _ and the opposition.
   Bulgaria holds its first free elections Sunday. The rallies were

   Hundreds of thousands were expected to attend, raising fears of
incidents.
   Mladenov, a senior member of the Socialist Party, pleaded for
restraint, saying the only way to behave was peacefully, avoiding
conflicts.
   In a goodwill agreement published Wednesday, campaign managers
Petko Simeonov of the opposition Union of Democratic Forces and
Luben Gotsev of the Socialists also asked rally participants to stay
peaceful.
   The city government of Sofia issued a ban on the sale of alcohol
effective immediately. It will stay in force through election day.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney joined White
House-congressional talks Wednesday but offered no indication the
Bush administration was ready to accept significant defense cuts,
participants said.
   Cheney entered the negotiations amid differences over how the
talks might be affected by Tuesday's vote in California to double
that state's gasoline tax. Democrats said it signaled that Americans
don't necessarily reject higher levies. But most Republicans
discounted the notion that the California vote would make budget
negotiators less fearful of boosting federal taxes.
   Most Democrats and some Republicans see the Defense Department
budget as a source of big savings next year. Budget negotiators are
trying to find a way to reduce next year's deficit to $64 billion,
the target set by the Gramm-Rudman law. However, the administration
has said the deficit could reach as high as $206 billion without
special attention.
   President Bush has proposed spending $303.3 billion on the
military for fiscal 1991, which starts Oct. 1. Opponents say that
recommendation ignores warming East-West relations and want to cut
it by at least $8 billion.
   ``No new numbers,'' Cheney said during a break when asked whether
he had offered a new defense proposal.
   The defense secretary, joined by Republicans, instead justified
the administration's spending request, which calls for slight
decreases in future years.
   Democrats said they were disappointed.
   ``The administration appears to be holding strong to the position
that defense should not be cut,'' said Senate Budget Committee
Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn. ``If we indeed are in a crisis
situation with regard to the federal budget ... then defense is
going to have to take its fair share of reductions.''
   Cheney and lawmakers agreed to examine how much money could be
saved by reducing military forces by one-quarter, an option the
secretary said was already under study at the Pentagon. Negotiators
said this would allow the two sides to work from common figures, and
was not an indication of a final agreement.
   While defense was the topic of the negotiations, many lawmakers
were mulling the 53 to 47 percent margin by which Californians voted
to double their gasoline tax to 18 cents. The money is to be used to
improve highways.
   ``It's an indication that the tax revolt ... has been tempered by
a realization that we have to make investments in the country,''
said House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash.
   ``This confirms what the polls have been saying, that people are
willing to pay additional taxes if they know they are going for a
specific purpose,'' said House Budget Committee Chairman Leon
Panetta, D-Calif.
   Panetta and Sasser agreed that on the other hand, raising local
taxes could make people more resentful of federal tax increases.
   ``This does make it more difficult for people to accept higher
federal taxes on top of it,'' Sasser said.
   Most Republicans said the California vote would not affect the
budget talks.
   ``California is a state unto itself,'' said Rep. Bill Archer of
Texas, ranking Republican on the tax-writing House Ways and Means
Committee. ``That's not relevant to what we're doing here.''
   House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., said it has always been
difficult for Congress to enact excise taxes on products such as
gasoline. But he said the California voting ``represents some little
change of heart, at least on the part of Californians.''
   Meanwhile, House Republicans and Democrats skirmished over plans
by Democrats to immediately begin writing spending bills for next
year.
   GOP lawmakers complained that the spending measures would be
overly expensive unless budget bargainers were first given a chance
to work out a deficit-reduction deal. They urged House leaders to
set June 28 as a deadline for completing the budget talks.
   Democrats said work on the spending bills must begin now with the
new fiscal year less than four months away.

<TEXT>
   The government rounded up at least
seven former Communist Party leaders Wednesday in a move likely to
hurt the chances of Communist candidates two days before the
nation's first free election since 1946.
   The party is running a distant third in opinion polls.
   Detained was Vasil Bilak, the former party official thought to
have invited in the Soviet troops who crushed the ``Prague Spring''
reform movement of Alexander Dubcek in 1968. At least six other
former senior Communists were questioned.
   In another political development, Josef Bartoncik, a major
Christian Democratic politician accused of having been a secret
police informer, was denounced by the minister charged with
investigating past secret police operations and urged to quit
politics.
   Wednesday's developments seemed likely to benefit the Civic Forum
movement of President Vaclav Havel, already favored to win Friday`s
elections. The Christian Democrats are running second in the surveys.
   Rumors consistently cited Bilak as the man who encouraged the
Soviets to invade in 1968.
   The state news agency CTK said Bilak was held ``on suspicion of
committing serious criminal activity.''
   Prominent Communists questioned Wednesday included former
president and party chief Gustav Husak; Milos Jakes, the party chief
ousted in last winter's pro-democracy revolution; and former Premier
Jozef Lenart, state TV news said.
   All three are associated with the purge of a half-million party
members and the imposition of orthodox Communist rule after the 1968
invasion.
   Former Slovak Communist official Peter Colotka was also
questioned, said an informed source who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   All with the exception of Husak spent the day at local police
stations. Husak, 76, is frail and was questioned at home.
   Deputy Interior Minister Andrej Samel said the questioning dealt
with the 1968 invasion and ``other criminal activities.``
   State television news said it also touched on illegal
acquisitions of property and mismanagement of hard currency accounts.
   The move appeared timed to satisfy popular demand that Bilak,
Jakes and others be punished for their part in the invasion and the
21 years of tough Communist rule that followed.
   Communists excluded, all parties contesting the parliamentary
election on Friday and Saturday have campaigned heavily on an
anti-Communist platform.
   In the past few weeks, state television has repeatedly broadcast
film of the invasion and other episodes associated with the hated
Communist rule, the horrors of which also are chronicled in a
recently opened exhibit.
   Bilak, 72, a former chief Communist ideologue, was picked up at
his home in the Slovak capital of Bratislava at midnight Tuesday,
Samel said.
   He will be held for 48 hours, state television said.
   One of the other officials summoned for questioning was Rudolf
Hegenbart, formerly in charge of security for the Communist party
and identified last week in a British Broadcasting Corp. documentary
as the man who allegedly conspired with the Soviet KGB to oust Jakes.
   The names of the others interrogated were not immediately
available.
   Last April, Czechoslovak prosecutors began investigating the 1968
Warsaw Pact invasion, which they termed a ``criminal offense against
peace.'' Deputy Prosecutor General Lubomir Veleta said then the
inquiry was intended to find all those responsible.
   An ``offense against peace'' carries a maximum sentence of 15
years in jail and does not fall under Czechoslovakia's 20-year
statute of limitations.
   The investigation has been stymied to date by Soviet refusal to
hand over all documents connected with the invasion. Prague is
particularly interested in a letter allegedly chronicling Bilak's
invitation to the Soviets to intervene.
   In a recent interview with the youth daily Mlada Fronta, Bilak
denied writing such a letter.
   In a statement on TV news, Deputy Interior Minister Jan Ruml
accused Bartoncik of breaking his word after promising Tuesday to
quit politics.
   Bartoncik is chairman of the People`s Party, which is in the
mainstream Christian Democratic movement.
   Bartoncik repeatedly denied being a secret police informer, but
made the pledge after being confronted with what Ruml termed facts
that made Bartoncik unfit to be a parliamentary deputy.
   Bartoncik's party said he was hospitalized Tuesday after reported
cardiac arrest.
   Ruml accused Bartoncik of trying to hide his past and said he
felt compelled to speak out, which may prompt more revelations about
leading politicians who once cooperated with the STB, the now
disbanded secret police.
   Civic Forum spokeswoman Jana Ryslinkova said Wednesday some Forum
candidates had resigned after being screened for past links with the
Communist secret police.
   She said she would not identify them because there were an
estimated 140,000 collaborators with the STB, and it would be unfair
to publish the names of some agents and omit others.
   ``Let`s give them a chance to live, but not to represent the
Civic Forum,`` she said.

   The Bush administration has informed Congress
it intends to sell Saudi Arabia more than $4 billion worth of light
armored vehicles, TOW anti-tank missiles, and modernization packages
for five AWACs surveillance planes, the Pentagon said Wednesday.
   If Congress doesn't object within 30 days, the sales are allowed
to go through. In the formal pre-notice period during which the
proposed arms sales were made known to members of Congress, no
objections were raised by lawmakers.
   The sales help fulfill Saudi Arabia's defense needs and support
U.S. strategic interests in the region, the Pentagon said.
   The sales also help boost U.S. weapons producers, many of whom
face the prospect of sharp reductions in U.S. defense spending.
   For the most part, the Saudi's military arsenal is U.S.-made,
though the desert kingdom concluded a $30 billion, multi-year deal
with British companies several years ago for fighter planes and
other weapons.
   ``This sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national
security of the United States by helping improve the security of a
friendly country, which has been and continues to be an important
force for political stability and economic progress in the Middle
East,'' the Pentagon said.
   The largest of three separate packages announced by the Defense
Department carries a $3.4 billion price tag and is destined to
support the Saudi National Guard, the Pentagon said.
   That package includes 1,117 Light Armored Vehicles; 2,000 TOW 11A
anti-tank missiles; 116 TOW missile launchers; 27 M-198 155mm
howitzers; ammunition; support equipment; the design and
construction of ranges and maintenance facilities for the equipment;
and U.S. government and contractor managment, training, logistical
and technical support for the items, the statement said.
   The LAV is a multi-purpose vehicles that carries a 25mm automatic
cannon and a machine gun. It is used by the U.S. Marines primarily
as a reconnaisance vehicle, as a troop carrier, or as a
light-armored command and control center.
   The other two packages include:
   _A $600 million ``modification and system integration'' program
for five AWACS (Airborne Warning and Control System) surveillance
aircraft and eight KE-3 tanker aircraft to improve their mission,
navigation, engine and aircraft protection systems, the Pentagon
said.
   The Pentagon said the systems were necessary for a common
configuration with similar U.S. aircraft, and to provide Saudi
Arabia with an ``effective air defense command and control network,
capable of countering all potential threats in the Persian Gulf
region.''
   The AWACS were the subject of a bruising battle in Congress in
1981 over the introduction of such sophisticated aircraft into the
volatile Mideast region.
   _A $26 million sale of 12 M88-A1 recovery vehicles with
additional weapons and equipment, including 12 M-2 .50-caliber
machine guns, spare and repair parts.
   The sale augments and earlier sale of nine such vehicles, which
are heavily armored and designed to tow damaged tanks or other
tracked vehicles from the battlefield.
   The prime contractor for the AWACS and tanker equipment sale is
Boeing Aircraft Co. of Seattle.
   The prime contractor for the LAV sale is General Motors of
Canada. For teh TOW missiles, the prime contractor is Hughes
Aircraft Corp., of Tombstone, Ariz.
   The prime contractor for the recovery vehicles is Bowen
McLaughlin York Corp., of York, Pa.

   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said
Wednesday the latest round of talks has left him confident about
solving the major stumbling block to German unification.
   The West German official, as part of the consultations aimed at
establishing the military stance of a united Germany, will meet with
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze on Monday in the Soviet
town of Brest near the Polish border.
   The Foreign Ministry in Bonn said the two men will visit the
grave of Shevardnadze's brother, a Soviet soldier who died there
during World War II, as a sign of reconciliation.
   As Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev explains his nation's
wariness about a militarily powerful Germany, he has been reminding
Western countries of his 20 million compatriots killed during World
War II.
   East Germany's prime minister, Lothar de Maiziere, flew to Moscow
on Wednesday to take part in a Warsaw Pact leaders' conference, the
government in East Berlin said.
   De Maiziere will fly to the United States this weekend for four
days of talks that will include a meeting with President Bush.
   On Tuesday, Secretary of State James A. Baker III discussed with
Shevardnadze a package of Western concessions to try to win Moscow's
approval of NATO membership for the powerful new German state.
   Asked if they had made progress, Baker said: ``I think we did.''
   ``The area of mutual understanding on the complex issues seems to
be broadening,'' Shevardnadze told reporters at the Soviet Embassy.
   In an interview Wednesday, Genscher said he shared the
superpowers' confidence.
   ``I have a positive assessment of my talks with the American
secretary of state and the Soviet foreign minister, which went late
into the evening,'' Genscher added.
   Genscher told the Norddeutsche Rundfunk radio network he is still
hoping to present a German unification plan to a European summit
this year, saying he hopes the meeting can take place before
December.
   Genscher will fly to the Soviet town of Brest for the
Shevardnadze meeting Monday, the Foreign Ministry said.
   ``It was an invitation from Shevardnadze,'' said a ministry
spokesman. ``Shevarnadze's brother died there during the fighting.
Shevardnadze invited him to visit the brother's grave, which in
light of the past, is certainly not an unmeaningful gesture from the
Soviet side.''
   Asked whether the visit was meant as a sign of
``reconciliation,'' the spokesman replied ``yes, certainly.'' The
spokesman, asking not to be identified by name, said Shevardnadze's
brother died in June 1941 but did not know the fallen soldier's
first name.

<HEAD>U.S. Concerned About Election Violence In Bulgaria</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department voiced new concern
Wednesday about election campaign violence in Bulgaria, and the
White House said President Bush plans to post a new ambassador there.
   Richard Boucher, the State Department's deputy spokesman, urged
``all political groups to abstain from violence and intimidation''
as Bulgarians head to the polls Sunday in the country's first
multi-party elections since World War II.
   ``We also emphasize that the Bulgarian government must take a
strong stand against intimidation and violence,'' he said.
   Bulgaria is moving toward democracy after more than four decades
of communist rule.
   Boucher called for an investigation into reports of fatalities
under mysterious circumstances.
   President Bush intends to nominate Hugh Kenneth Hill, a career
envoy, as the next ambassador to Sofia, the White House announced.
   Hill, if confirmed, would succeed Sol Polansky, whose three-year
term in the Sofia post ends in September. Hill, 52, is chief of the
State Department's senior officer division. He was deputy chief of
mission in Sofia in 1982-84.
   Polansky journeyed to Copenhagen, Denmark, to brief Secretary of
State James A. Baker III, on Tuesday about reports of election
violence and intimidation by the ruling Bulgarian Socialist Party,
formerly the communists.
   Meanwhile, a U.S. delegation to monitor the election left on a
six-day mission to Bulgaria. It is chaired by Oklahoma Gov. Henry
Bellmon.
   Also on the delegation are: Polansky; Jack Perry, a former U.S.
ambassador to Bulgaria who now teaches political science at Davidson
College in North Carolina; Richard D. McLellan, a lawyer from
Michigan; Marshall L. Miller, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., and
Eunice B. Whittlesey, a Republican National Committeewoman from New
York.
   Bellmon was joined by his wife, Shirley, on the mission.

   Eight Greenpeace protesters dangled from the
205-foot-high Astoria Bridge on Wednesday in a futile effort to
block the battleship USS New Jersey from entering the Columbia River.
   The protesters hung about 50 feet below the 4{-mile-long bridge
and unfurled banners that read, ``Nuclear Free Seas.''
   The 887-foot battleship waited offshore to enter the river as
authorities tried unsuccessfully to dislodge the protesters.
   The activists raised themselves on ropes when a freighter
approached, said state police Detective Mike Schacher. They remained
high enough to clear the ship when the New Jersey came through later
and ``a couple of them went up a little higher,'' he said.
   Greenpeace spokeswoman Cynthia Rust said the protest was to
``prevent the USS New Jersey from endangering the health and safety
of the citizens of Oregon and Washington by bringing nuclear
weapons'' up the Columbia.
   She noted that voters have declared coastal Clatsop County a
``nuclear free zone.''
   Schacher said police did not plan to physically hoist the
protesters into custody.
   ``We can get to them, but we're not going to,'' he said. ``The
reason for that is the safety of our people and for them.''
   The protesters would be arrested ``at such time as they either
come down or come up,'' Schacher said. He said the demonstrators had
enough rope to lower themselves into Greenpeace rafts on the river.
   ``I think they're just going to hang around, literally,''
Schacher said.
   Ms. Rust said the protesters planned to raise themselves to the
bridge one at a time, but did not say when.
   ``We feel our protest was a huge success,'' she said. ``Our
intention was not to endanger the vessel or endanger the climbers.''
   The protesters face state criminal tresspassing charges and
federal charges of violating the 200-yard safety zone around the
ship, Schacher said.
   Greenpeace wasn't certain what kind of weapons were aboard the
New Jersey. The Navy has a policy of not commenting on whether its
vessels are carrying nuclear arms.
   The New Jersey is renowned for its 16-inch guns, each of which is
capable of delivering nearly a ton of high explosives at a rate of
one shell every 30 seconds.
   Firing of the guns and those aboard the three other Iowa-class
battleships has been suspended pending investigation of an April 19,
1989, explosion on the USS Iowa that killed 47.
   The New Jersey was en route to Portland, where it planned to join
30 other ships that traditionally tie up at the waterfront for the
Rose Festival.

<HEAD>Son of Late President Nasser Arrested on Return to Egypt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The eldest son of the late President Gamal
Abdel Nasser was arrested Wednesday after flying in for his trial in
connection with terrorist attacks against Israeli and U.S.
diplomats, the Middle East News Agency reported.
   The charges against Khaled Abdel Nasser, 40, an engineer and a
professor at Cairo University, and 19 other defendants stemmed from
attacks that left two Israeli diplomats dead and six Israelis and
two Americans injured.
   Nasser and 10 others were charged with murder, undermining
Egypt's security and damaging its relations with Israel and the
United States. The indictment demanded they be condemned to death.
   The state-owned MENA news agency said Nasser was arrested
immediately after he arrived at Cairo International Airport, but
gave no details. Nasser was known to be living in self-imposed exile
in Yugoslavia.
   He was outside Egypt when he and the others, alleged members of a
group calling itself Egypt's Revolution, were indicted in February
1988.
   Nasser had protested his innocence in newspaper interviews in
Yugoslavia and pledged to return to attend the trial, which started
in November 1988.
   Also listed as a defendant was Mahmoud Nour el-Din el-Sayed Ali
Suliman, a businessman and former administrator at the Egyptian
embassy in London.
   Nasser, whose father was president from 1958-70, was specifically
charged with helping form the group and providing members with
weapons and money.
   Nine defendants, including President Nasser's nephew, Gamal
Shawky Abdel Nasser, were charged with complicity of various kinds
and could be sentenced on conviction to prison terms of up to 25
years.
   Egypt's Revolution has claimed responsibility for three attacks
on Israeli diplomatic personnel, in 1984, 1985 and 1986, in which
gunmen killed two Israelis and wounded six.
   Two American diplomats among three diplomats attacked in May 1987
by gunmen riding in a passing car. The two suffered minor injuries.

   China freed 97 pro-democracy protesters, including
two student leaders, after the anniversary of the June 4 army attack
on last year's demonstrations passed without major unrest, officials
said Wednesday.
   The releases bring to 881 the number freed the past six months,
out of thousands arrested.
   But new arrests have been reported as recently as last week, and
the releases did not signal a softening by the aging leadership.
   The leaders still maintain last spring's massive protests for
democratic reform and an end to corruption were part of a coup
attempt and that Western-style democracy is inappropriate for China.
   Rather, the leaders appeared to be trying to put the protests
behind them and improve their image at home and abroad. China's
most-favored-nation trade status remains under review in the U.S.
Congress, and foreign tourism and investment far below their
pre-June 1989 level.
   There still was no word on the fate of three participants in last
year's movement who dropped out of sight last week, as they planned
to issue an open letter to the leadership calling for the release of
jailed protesters.
   The three had been the only Chinese to continue speaking openly
for democratic reform.
   Two of the three, Gao Xin and Zhou Duo, were jailed after the
June crackdown and released in December and May, respectively. The
third was well-known folk singer Hou Dejian. Sources indicated they
were taken into police custody, possibly as a protective move before
the June 4 anniversary.
   Three Beijing University students were arrested May 25 for
alleged counterrevolutionary activities.
   The latest prisoner release, announced by the official Xinhua
News Agency, included for the first time two top student leaders.
Xiong Wei and Zhou Fengsuo, both students at Qinghua University in
Beijing, were arrested last June after being included on the
government's list of 21 most-wanted students.
   Zhou was turned in by his sister and Xiong surrendered in his
mother's company, according to official accounts. The No. 1 student
on the list, Wang Dan, remains in jail.
   Xinhua said 19 other students also were freed.
   Most of the releases were from Beijing jails, but 21 were freed
in Shanghai. Among those was Yao Yongzhan, a Hong Kong student who
was released Tuesday, according to the Hong Kong government.
   Yao, who was arrested at Shanghai airport in June 1989 as he was
about to board a flight to Hong Kong, returned to the British colony
Wednesday.
   Xinhua said the 97 were given lenient treatment after having
``voluntarily confessed their wrongdoings and expressed a
willingness to repent.'' None had been charged or tried.
   It said the government combined punishment with leniency in
dealing with the protesters, ``and made every effort to educate
those who can be educated. Those who obstinately stick to an
incorrect course and refuse to repent will be punished strictly in
accordance with the law.''
   In another deveopment, grass-roots Communist Party committees in
a region of China where a minority rebellion occurred in April will
undergo a shake-up.
   The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region party committee ``will spend
the next two to three years carrying out a rectification of party
grass-roots organizations and grass-roots power,'' the Xinjiang
Daily newspaper said.
   Rectification is the party's euphemism for an intense
investigation followed by purges of anyone failing to measure up to
the political standard.
   Moslem ethnic minorities declared a holy war in April in Baren
Township in Xinjiang, near the western border with the Soviet Union.
Official reports say 22 died in an attempt to set up an independent
republic of East Turkistan. The attempt was put down by soldiers and
armed police.

   Someone threw a grenade last week at the U.S.
Embassy in Somalia, and U.S. officials are concerned about growing
anarchy in the strategically placed African country, a U.S. official
said on Wednesday.
   The grenade, which exploded without significant damage or
injuries, was lobbed into the embassy compound by an unknown
assailant, an administration official said.
   The embassy complex, the largest in sub-Saharan Africa, boasts
three swimming pools and a nine-hole golf course.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
seaside capital has been beset in recent months by fuel shortages,
water and electricity interruptions, and rampant crime. ``The
security situation is at a nadir,'' he said.
   Foreign reporters are usually denied access to Somalia, at the
tip of the Horn of Africa on the eastern approaches to the Red Sea,
and reliable information about the situation there is hard to obtain.
   The government of Siad Barre has been losing power over the past
year to various coalitions of rebels fighting to unseat the aging,
often-ruthless leader. ``The military is just not defeating them,''
said the official.
   Despite the deterioration of security and the widespread
opposition to Barre, U.S. officials do not think he will be toppled
in the near future. ``Somalia is unstable, but we're not expecting
anything like that imminently,'' the official said.
   One reason is the disunity among the rebel groups and the lack of
a leader with sufficient popularity or clout to replace Barre, who
seized power in a 1968 coup.
   Barre's repressive government has become increasingly isolated
and the United States, once one of Somalia's main backers, has cut
off virtually all aid. Plans call for the U.S. Embassy staff of 430
to be reduced by half by year's end.
   The United States still has an agreement to use the Somali port
of Berbera as a contingency base in case of an emergency in the
region.
   Human rights groups say that as Barre's control has slipped, his
abuses have grown in an effort to exert control.
   A three-member delegation from Amnesty International will leave
for Mogadishu on Saturday to discuss ``gross violations of human
rights'' with Somali authorities, an official with the human rights
organization said. The group last visited in June 1989.
   A report commissioned by the State Department last summer
concluded that the Somali army murdered at least 5,000 people over
an 11-month period.

   Severe thunderstorms boomed through the central Plains on
Wednesday and into the mid-Mississippi Valley, spawning tornadoes in
parts of Indiana and Kentucky, and a storm stretched along much of
the West Coast.
   Neither state reported injuries or major damage from the severe
weather. But cleanup work was halted and the first burial of one of
Saturday's tornado victims was cut short Wednesday as nervous
residents in Petersburg, Ind., took cover from a threatening
thunderstorm.
   The memory of Saturday night was still fresh in the minds of
many. Six people were killed as a tornado tore through the city,
damaging or destroying two-thirds of the community. Two others were
killed elsewhere as tornadoes skipped across southern and central
sections of Indiana.
   Rain fell in Missouri, with Kansas City reporting at least 2 and
St. Louis up to 4 inches. Missouri's Clay County reported flash
flooding, as 5 inches of rain fell; flash flooding was also reported
in southwestern Illinois.
   More than a half-inch of rain fell along the Oregon coast;
Washington state and northwestern California also had precipitation.
   The Southwest remained quite hot; by early afternoon the
temperature was more than 100 degrees in Lubbock, Texas, and
Carlsbad, N.M.
   The weather was chilly in the Northeast and East. Temperatures
dipped into the 20s and 30s in sections of Maine. It was 53 degrees
in Cape Hatteras, N.C., a new record for the date.
   Winds gusted over 50 mph in Southern California, causing a dust
storm in the Rosamond area of Kern County.
   Temperatures at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 102 at Carlsbad to 26 at
Guilford, Maine.
   Thursday's forecast called for showers from the northern Rockies
into the northern Plains, and showers and thunderstorms from the
Midwest to the Chesapeake Bay.
   High pressure was expected to produce dry weather from Minnesota
to the Great Lakes.

   The Bush administration's protocol chief,
Joseph Reed, Wednesday accused Minnesota Democratic Gov. Rudy
Perpich of behaving ``very badly'' in barring the state's two
Republican senators from a luncheon for Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev.
   ``It was my understanding with Governor Perpich that they were to
be invited. As far as I'm concerned he reneged on that
understanding,'' Reed told reporters at he White House.
   In St. Paul, Minn., Perpich angrily denied that he ever agreed
the senators would be invited to the Gorbachev luncheon.
   ``I feel very badly that such a successful visit could be marred
by petty politics,'' the governor said.
   Reed said Sens. David Durenburger and Rudy Boschwitz showed up at
the door of the governor's mansion and were turned away from
Sunday's luncheon for the visiting Soviet VIPs.
   They were directed instead to a luncheon next door for other
politicians who were not invited, said Reed, the State Department
official who was sent along by President Bush to help facilitate
Gorbachev's swing through Minnesota and San Francisco after the
Soviet leader left Washington last Sunday.
   ``And when I learned this, there was nothing that could be
done,'' Reed said of the slight to the two senators. ``After all, I
was only a guest also, I was not the host. So I urged directly with
President Gorbachev that he meet the two senators and the entire
congressional delegation, which he did following the luncheon.''
   Gorbachev held a hastily arranged hand-shaking session with the
senators and other members of Congress who had been excluded from
the lunch.
   ``The governor of Minnesota behaved very badly,'' Reed said,
citing the incident as the only flaw in Gorbachev's visit to the
United States.
   The two senators were not neglected by Gorbachev. Both were
invited to fly with him from Washington to Minnesota. Only Boschwitz
could accept, and he had a long conversation with Gorbachev on the
flight.

   A train smashed into a tractor-trailer
rig Wednesday, killing the driver of a pickup truck crushed by one
of 15 cars that derailed, authorities said.
   The collision occurred around 3 p.m. at a rail crossing on a dirt
road off Alabama 69, said Tuscaloosa County Sheriff's Deputy Richard
Greene.
   The truck didn't stop at the crossing and the train smashed into
the trailer, Greene said.
   One of three train engines that derailed toppled onto a pickup
traveling on a road alongside the tracks, killing the truck's
driver, authorities said. The victim's name was withheld pending
notification of relatives.
   The tractor-trailer's driver and the three men aboard the train
were not hurt, Greene said.
   Twelve other train cars derailed.
   The crossing had no lights or crossing gates, but was marked and
the train's engineer told authorities he was blowing his horn as he
approached, Greene said.
   No charges had been filed, he said.

   A soldier has been charged with the
shooting death of American tourist Thomas Atkinson and is awaiting
trial in the military prison of La Pica, U.S. Embassy spokeswoman
Barbara Moore confirmed Wednesday.
   She did not identify the soldier, but said he had been held since
the death last February of Atkinson, a teacher from Wellington, N.Y.
Formal charges were filed two weeks ago.
   This was the account received by the embassy:
   A group of U.S. tourists were being driven to the Caribbean
resort city of Puerto La Cruz when they were stopped at a military
checkpoint, where soldiers were fumigating vehicles as part of a
Health Ministry campaign to stop a dengue epidemic from spreading.
   An argument broke out when the driver refused to have the minivan
fumigated, and the driver stepped on the gas and tried to escape.
   The soldier fired at the fleeing van, hitting Atkinson, who was
in the back seat. Atkinson died hours later after an emergency
operation at a Puerto La Cruz hospital.
   A warrant was issued charging the minivan driver with ``verbal
abuse and trying to run over the soldier,'' Ms. Moore told The
Associated Press.

   A communique from the administrative offices for federal courts
in Bogota identified the five as Peter Stuart MacLeese, Brian David
Tomkins, Andrew Gibson, Dean Shelley and John Owen.
   A judicial source told The Associated Press all five are presumed

leader Gonzalo Rodriguez.
   Rodriguez was killed last Dec. 15 in a gunbattle with police.
   The judge has asked the Foreign Ministry to extradite the five to

   Names of judges handling cases involving drug traffickers are not

   A West German official was voted in
Wednesday as new mayor of East Germany's second largest city,
Leipzig.
   Heinrich Lehmann-Grube, 57, a left-leaning Social Democrat and
former city director of Hanover in West Germany, drew 88 of 118
votes in the Leipzig city council.
   He was given a leave of absence to run for the job, previously
held by Guenter Haedrich, a former member of East Germany's old
Communist party.
   Leipzig, with 550,000 people, is second to East Berlin, with 1.2
million residents. Leipzig was the cradle of East Germany's
pro-democracy movement.
   Lehmann-Grube is the second West German to be chosen mayor of an
East German city since the country's first democratic elections in
March.
   West German businessman Dieter Noll, a member of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's conservative Christian Democratic Union, was elected
mayor of the former city of Karl-Marx-Stadt last week, when the city
was officialy renamed Chemnitz. The city population is 308,000.

   Army officials and two pilots involved in the
U.S. invasion of Panama hailed the use of night-vision goggles
Wednesday as lawmakers expressed concerns about accidents when the
devices were used.
   ``The U.S. Army and Army Aviation own the night,'' Maj. Gen.
Rudolph Ostovich III, commanding general of the U.S. Army Aviation
Center, told a House panel.
   The Army officials said use of the goggles during the December
nighttime incursion provided the U.S. military with a significant
advantage in stopping the Panamanian Defense Forces.
   Night-vision goggles electronically amplify moonlight and
starlight, displaying images on two tiny video screens.
   Capt. Tim Jones, whose helicopter was shot down during the
invasion, said he was in the area near Fort Amador for 20 minutes,
seeking out the enemy before his craft was fired upon.
   He attributed the shootdown to a gunner sweeping the area or
firing in the vicinity where he could hear helicopters.
   ``If it had been the daytime, I shudder to think what the results
may have been had they been able to see us as well as the 20 plus
other helicopters that came into that area,'' Jones said.
   Chief Warrant Officer Larry Mann, who has worked with
night-vision goggles for 10 years, said without the devices it would
have been ``a lot more catastrophic for us.''
   Rep. Frank McCloskey, D-Ind., an outspoken critic of the goggles,
said the use of the devices apparently contributed to the success of
U.S. invasion, but stressed that there was no excuse for unsafe
training procedures.
   McCloskey noted recent statistics that show 7.7 night-vision
goggles accidents per 100,000 flying hours for the third and fourth
quarters of 1989 and the first quarter of 1990. The Army's overall
flight accident rate is 1.8 accidents per 100,000 hours.
   The lawmaker said that since March 1988, there have been 22
accidents and 70 deaths.
   ``I realize semantic differences exist between myself and the
Pentagon as to whether a specific accident was caused by the goggles
or by pilot error,'' McCloskey said.
   ``However, the goggle technology, while impressive, does have
limitations and these limitations must be recognized when the
goggles are used in aviation.''

<HEAD>Communist Albania Says It Will Adhere to Human Rights Accords</HEAD>

   Communist Albania pledged Wednesday to
adopt basic reforms _ short of free elections _ and seek equal
status with the 35 nations that signed the Helsinki security and
human rights accords.
   Albanian representatives to an East-West human rights meeting
said their country would also seek full membership in the Conference
on Security and Cooperation in Europe ``as soon as possible.''
   Adhering to the Helsinki agreements and joining the conference
would be major steps for the isolated Balkan nation of 3 million,
the sole remaining hard-line Communist country in Eastern Europe
after democratic reforms swept across its East bloc neighbors the
past year.
   ``The game is that we adopt all the rules of the conference and,
of course, take care to accept what has been accepted by the other
participating counrties,'' said Petriti Bushati, Albania's
ambassador to Sweden, who led the delegation.
   But he said Albania needed a transition period to study the
international conventions, which it would have to affirm as a
condition for membership. A consensus of conference members would be
required to admit Albania.
   On Tuesday, the delegation was granted observer status to a
conference meeting. The 35 nations are holding a four-week session
to consider proposals on political pluralism and the rule of law in
the member states.
   Albania is the only nation in Europe that refused to sign the
1975 Helsinki agreements. The group also includes the United States
and Canada.
   Despite some reforms, Albania has no intention to hold multiparty
elections, Bejo Sazan, an Albanian Foreign Ministry official, told a
news conference.
   Sazan said Albania had no history of organized political
opposition, and he claimed the ruling Communist Party represented
the interests of all the people.
   ``No society anywhere, where there is full approval of the
government by the people, (would) artificially create an opposition
to this government,'' he said. ``We cannot see what will happen in
50 years or 100 years, but that is the situation today in Albania.''
   There were reports earlier this year of politically or
economically inspired riots outside the capital, but they were never
confirmed by the government.
   Asked about political prisoners, Bushati confirmed 85 prisoners
are being held, but said they were guilty of using violence to try
to overthrow the government.
   Albania announced a series of reforms last month, including freer
travel for its citizens and abolition of restrictions on religious
publications. It also adopted economic reforms relaxing government
control over enterprises.
   Premier Adil Carcani told the Parliament in Tirana in May that
Albania wanted to join the conference and establish diplomatic
relations with the United States, the Soviet Union and the members
of the European Community.

<HEAD>British Bandleader Joe Loss Dead at 80</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bandleader Joe Loss, a favorite of Britain's royal
family, died in a London hospital Wednesday, his agent said. Loss
was 80 and recently celebrated his 60th anniversary in the music
business.
   He had suffered from kidney problems, agent Robert Holmes said.
   Loss was born Joshua Alexander Loss, the son of a cabinetmaker
who wanted him to become a classical violinist. Loss' first job was
playing the violin in silent films for about $2.50 a week.
   He was fascinated by dance band music and at 20 became Britain's
youngest band leader, playing at the Astoria Ballroom in Charing
Cross Road in London.
   Loss once said he had married more couples than any clergyman
because of the number of people who wed after meeting at his dances.
   The Joe Loss Orchestra played many years on the cruise ship Queen
Elizabeth II and entertained the royal family at Buckingham Palace
and Windsor Castle.
   Dame Vera Lynn was accompanied by Loss' band on her first radio
broadcast.
   His signature tune ``In the Mood,'' sold 1 million copies.
   Loss claimed the secret of his long career was his energetic
foot-tapping.
   ``I once put on a pedometer and discovered that I had walked
eight miles in a three-hour performance,'' he said.
   Loss announced his retirement last year, but played in London in
February and had planned more appearances.

   An aerospace company accused of providing cheaper,
less durable steel for the Army's Apache attack helicopter for
nearly six years has agreed to pay $232,518 in fines and
restitution, the government announced Wednesday.
   Royce Aerospace Material Corp., of North Amityville, N.Y.,
pleaded guilty to one count of making false statements, the U.S.
attorney's office said in a statement. Sentencing was set for Aug.
13 before U.S. District Judge Paul G. Rosenblatt.
   The government said Royce provided a different type of steel than
that specified to a subcontractor for AH-64 Apache helicopters made
by McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Co. of Mesa.
   The substituted steel wears out sooner and costs less than the
specified type, the government said.
   The substitution had been taking place from 1983 through 1989,
and had cost the government $77,000, the U.S. attorney's office said.
   ``In an effort to disguise the subsitution, Royce provided false
certification and false documents to the subcontractor,'' the U.S.
attorney's office said.

<TEXT>
   For his 20 years of service, city employee
James Moran was awarded a plaque and a certificate for a free dinner
for two.
   After three lobster tails, 33 orders of jumbo shrimp cocktail,
four dozen steamed oysters and an assortment of steaks and other
seafood, Moran and his date amassed a $510 bill _ and the city was
stuck with the tab.
   ``When somebody goes out and does something like this it's a
shame,'' City Manager Gene Strickland said Tuesday. ``It absolutely
flabbergasted me. ... It only takes one person to mess up a good
program for everyone else.''
   Moran's supervisors at Lakeland Electric and Water also were not
amused. They recommended he be fired from his $38,771-a-year job.
   City officials modified the punishment to a two-week suspension
and a demotion that will cut Moran's pay by more than $11,000 a year.
   Moran eventually paid the April 19 dinner bill himself and
appealed his suspension and demotion Wednesday before the city's
civil service board, which voted to uphold the punishment.
   He could not be reached for comment, but his attorney, Robert
Grizzard II, defended his client's heavy meal.
   Moran enjoys spending lavishly on an occasional night on the
town, and he and his fiancee have spent $200 or more for dinner on
other occasions, Grizzard said.
   ``They ordered lots of food and had a wonderful time,'' Grizzard
said. ``They were told there was no limit on the ticket so they
didn't worry about it.''
   Meals, service pins and retirement plaques are paid out of the
city's employee service award account. Of the 22 free meals given
out last year, the highest bill totaled $60, the lowest about $34.

   A turboprop plane carrying 42
people crashed Wednesday in a jungle clearing just short of an
airport in the eastern Amazon, and an airline official said 22
people died.
   The plane nosedived about a half-mile short of the runway in the
Amazon city of Altamira, said Roberto Saquette, a spokesman for TABA
airlines. Altamira is 2,100 miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro.
   Nineteen passengers and the co-pilot were killed on impact and
the pilot and a passenger died en route to the hospital, Saquette
said by telephone late Wednesday.
   ``There was no warning,'' crew member Rodolfo Lopes de Miranda
told the Manchete TV network. ``There was a great screeching noise
and the floor rose up and threw us up against the ceiling. Then
everything went black.''
   Another TABA spokesman, Odacil Catele, said: ``There was no
explosion on impact and the plane didn't catch fire. God was with
them.''
   Officials have not determined the cause of the crash, Catele said.
   Soldiers from the Altamira army base pulled survivors from the
wreckage and carried them on stretchers to army jeeps.
   The air force later transported all 20 survivors 460 miles to the
Amazon port of Belem, where they were in satisfactory condition at
the Air Force Hospital, Saquette said.
   The plane, a British-made Foch-Hiller turboprop, took off from
Belem for Altamira, the first of five stops. The route also included
stopovers in the Amazon cities of Santarem, Itaituba, Alta Floresta
and Cuiaba.

<HEAD>Baltic Presidents Ask Gorbachev to Start Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAREY GOLDBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The presidents of the Baltic states of Lithuania,
Latvia and Estonia asked President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Wednesday
to open talks at once on their drives for independence, a Latvian
spokesman said.
   The Council of Baltic States ``appeals to you, Mr. President, to
call a joint meeting without delay to define the issues and the
order of full negotiations,'' the telegram said.
   Aris Jansons, an aide to Latvian President Anatoly Gorbunov,
translated the telegram unofficially in a telephone interview from
the republic's capital of Riga, where the three presidents signed it.
   The meeting was the second gathering of the council since it was
re-established last month. It came a day after Gorbachev returned
from the superpower summit in Washington to face renewed unrest in
the southern Soviet Union and impasse in the Baltics.
   Gorbachev's tough stance with the Baltics, particularly
Lithuania, has brought him censure from the West, but President Bush
still signed an agreement with him last week opening the way to
trade benefits for the Soviet Union.
   Members of the U.S. Congress, however, predict Bush will have a
hard time gaining needed support for the measure as long as
Gorbachev refuses to negotiate with Lithuania.
   At a news conference after the signing, presidents Gorbunov of
Latvia, Vytautas Landsbergis of Lithuania and Arnold Ruutel of
Estonia generally reserved judgment on what effect the superpower
summit would have on the secessionist Baltic region.
   But Jansons said Gorbunov noted because neither Gorbachev nor
Bush appeared to have changed his position on the issue, ``in that
sense we can conclude that the summit in Washington was nothing new
for us.''
   Landsbergis said it was too early to predict what the summit's
effect would be, and Ruutel said it may help strengthen Soviet
democracy, said Jansons.
   He said they kept their remarks brief and did not go into
specifics.
   Lithuania declared its independence on March 11, and Latvia and
Estonia have since announced the beginning of transition periods to
full independence.
   Gorbachev clamped a partial economic blockade on Lithuania in
response and refused to recognize Latvian and Estonian independence
moves. He told Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene of Lithuania he
would not open negotiations with her republic until it suspended its
declaration.
   The Baltic Council also ratified a pledge Wednesday that
non-native permanent residents of the republics would be guaranteed
full human rights, Jansons said. Many Russians in the Baltic
republics say they fear they may become second-class citizens or be
forced to leave when the three states become fully independent.
   The telegram to Gorbachev complained that delays in settling
relations between the Baltics and the Kremlin have led to ``the
disorder of the economy and abnormal relations between peoples,''
Jansons said.
   In Latvia, panic buying spurred by fears that the Kremlin would
include it in the partial blockade prompted authorities to introduce
rationing on several food items last week.
   In Lithuania, more than 400 factories have cut back their working
hours and about 50,000 people have been laid off, reports said.
   The three independent Baltic states were annexed by the Soviet
Union in 1940. They revived their pre-World War II alliance on May
12; it was orginally established in 1934.

   Liberian President Samuel K. Doe has asked the
United States to help him deal with an increasingly powerful rebel
movement that threatens to topple his government, an administration
official said on Wednesday.
   The official said earlier Wednesday that Doe has asked for help
in getting out of the country. But that same official later said he
was unsure of his facts and knew only that Doe had sent a letter
asking for help in resolving the issue.
   U.S. diplomats told Doe he should attempt to reach an
accommodation with insurgent leaders, said the official, who asked
not to be identified.
   Meanwhile, other officials said the administration is arranging
special flights to allow several hundred American citizens to leave
Liberia because of the deteriorating situation there.
   The officials said the U.S. government is in contact with an air
carrier that will fly the Americans to the neighboring Ivory Coast
from where they will be flown to the United States.
   The intermediate stop in the Ivory Coast is necessary because the
biggest airport still operating in Liberia is too small to
accommodate large jetliners. The operation is expected to begin on
Saturday.
   But some Americans are expected to be on two regularly scheduled
Air Guinea international flights Thursday and another on Friday.
   The State Department is strongly urging all of the more than
3,000 Americans still in Liberia to leave the country because of the
concerns about personal safety.
   The U.S. Navy has a four-ship flotilla in international waters
off the Liberian coast to evacuate the Americans and possibly
foreign diplomats if departures cannot be carried out through
commercial means.
   In response to a request from the Soviet Union, the United States
has said it would be willing to include Soviet diplomats along with
others in any evacuation, State Department deputy spokesman Richard
Boucher said.
   Commenting on Doe's situation, the officials said the State
Department has been quietly asking several African countries whether
they would be willing to provide him with a safe haven if he is
forced to flee.
   The officials refused to say which countries have been approached
or what the responses were.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater had no comment on U.S.
diplomatic efforts in Liberia except to say that both the government
and the rebels have been asked to find a way to end their conflict.
   The inquiries about a safe haven for Doe underscore the
administration's impression that his 10-year old rule will not
survive much longer and that what began as a tiny rebel movement
last December probably will assume power shortly.
   The rebels have seized the headquarters of the world's largest
rubber plantation owned by the Japanese tire-maker Bridgestone
Corp., Liberia's biggest employer, and are now believed to control
every major industrial concern in the West African country.
   The officials said there is little in the background of the rebel
leader, Charles Taylor, to suggest a strong commitment to democratic
principles.
   The extent to which the rebels have been able to generate support
is less a reflection of Taylor's appeal than of the widespread
opposition to Doe's government, according to the officials.
   Doe is widely accused of mismanaging the economy. His problems
have been compounded by tribal divisions and mass desertions from
the Liberian army.
   Taylor, 42, is a former high Liberian government official who
five years ago escaped from a Massachusetts prison where he was
awaiting extradition to his homeland on charges he had embezzled
millions of dollars in public funds.
   Taylor, who has studied in the United States, has denied U.S.
charges that his group received backing from Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi.
   Historically, the United States has had close ties with Liberia
because the country was founded by descendants of freed U.S. slaves
more than 150 years ago. Liberia also serves as a center for U.S.
military communications and as a relay station for Voice of America
broadcasts to Africa.

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses Desegregation Lawsuit After Nine-Year Battle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Justice Department was
considering its next move Wednesday after a federal judge threw out
a desegregation lawsuit against the Charleston County School
District.
   U.S. District Judge Sol Blatt Jr. late Tuesday dismissed the 1981
lawsuit, which challenged a 1967 law creating the nearly
43,000-student countywide school district.
   In another decades-old desegregation battle, school officials in
Jacksonville, Fla., and NAACP leaders agreed on a countywide
desegregation plan with reduced mandatory busing.
   In the South Carolina case, Blatt found no intent to discriminate
by state lawmakers who passed the 1967 law. He ruled that some
schools in the district remain predominantly black because of the
makeup of neighborhoods, geography and decisions by white parents to
put their students in private schools.
   Justice Department spokeswoman Amy Casner said the department was
reviewing the decision and had not decided whether to appeal. Notice
of appeal must generally be made within 60 days, she said in a
telephone interview from Washington.
   The 1967 act created a countywide school board to oversee eight
local school districts and spread tax money among them. The local
boards retained control of faculty and student assignments, however,
making it ``slightly more difficult'' to achieve greater
desegregation, Blatt found.
   The Justice Department, later joined by The NAACP Legal Defense
and Education Fund, asked that the local districts be abolished and
Blatt order a better integration plan.
   Fifty-six percent of the district's 42,774 students are black; 35
percent of the black students attend classes in schools that are 90
percent black. But Blatt said this was not necessarily evidence of
illegal segregation.
   It is possible that even without the local districts, ``true
integration would be impossible in Charleston County because of its
rather unique geography,'' the judge wrote.
   ``With all of its rivers and bridges and its nearly 100-mile
area, extensive busing would be extremely dangerous,'' he said.
   Blatt's decision followed years of delays in the case, and 11
months of arguments in a non-jury trial involving 80 witnesses and
more than 2,600 exhibits.
   Arthur McFarland, an attorney representing student plaintiffs in
the case, said the decision will have to be reviewed before an
appeal is considered.
   In Jacksonville, the Duval County School Board and U.S. District
Judge John H. Moore II must approve the agreement school officials
reached with the local chapter of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People.
   It would eliminate the busing of some 14,000 students, change
groupings of grade levels, provide $60 million for inner-city school
improvements and set up programs to attract students of all races to
schools that have predominantly black enrollments.
   Superintendent Larry Zenke called the agreement reached Tuesday
after almost six months of negotiations a ``win-win'' proposition
for both sides.
   The Rev. Henry Green, president of a coalition of about 60 black
ministers, said black residents must ``take a wait-and-see attitude
to make sure that promises that have been made are kept, because so
many promises that have been made in the past have been broken.''
   Duval County was ordered by a federal judge in the early 1960s to
desegregate its schools. Court-ordered crosstown busing began in
1971, and the NAACP sued again in 1985, claiming the school system
was not fully desegregated.
   Moore ruled in 1988 that students in Duval County were getting an
equal education, but last fall an appeals court disagreed and placed
the school system back under court review, leading to the recent
negotiations.

   The 10th annual Livingston Awards for Young
Journalists were given Wednesday to four journalists, including a
special posthumous citation for a reporter killed while
investigating drug lords and revolutionaries in South America.
   Todd Smith, a columnist and reporter for The Tampa (Fla.)
Tribune, was nominated for a story published in September connecting
Peru's ``Shining Path'' guerrillas to drug lords in Colombia.
   While following up the story in Peru, Smith was kidnapped Nov.
17; his body was found on a soccer field in Uchiza, Peru, four days
later.
   The Livingston Foundation created the posthumous award for Smith,
who would have been 30.
   Peter Gumbel, 32, a Wall Street Journal reporter in Moscow, won
the award for international reporting for a story on the perils of
perestroika.
   Tom Ashbrook, 34, foreign editor of The Boston Globe, was awarded
the national reporting prize for a story on how Asia was moving
ahead of the United States in the world.
   Michele Norris, 28, of The Washington Post, won the local
reporting prize for a story on a 6-year-old boy's life at home with
a crack-addicted mother.
   More than 500 entries were submitted by editors from stories
published or broadcast in 1989. Each winner receives a citation and
$5,000.
   The awards are administered by the foundation at the University
of Michigan and are meant to encourage excellence among journalists
under 35.

   Argentines and East Germans no longer require visas
to enter Britain, the Home Office said Wednesday.
   The requirement will be dropped as of Thursday, said the Home
Office, which is responsible for immigration regulations.
   The lifting of the curbs on East German citizens follows a joint
agreement signed by Common Market countries last month.
   There has been no announcement from Argentina that it will allow
British citizens to travel there without visas, but such an
announcement is expected.
   An agreement signed earlier this year by Foreign Secretary
Douglas Hurd and his Argentine counterpart, Domingo Cavallo, paved
the way for the restrictions to be lifted.
   The two met in February, and agreed to restore diplomatic links
broken during the Falklands war. Direct air travel had resumed
earlier.
   In a related development Wednesday, the Organization of American
States urged Argentina and Britain to continue negotiation until
``they reach definitive solution to all their differences'' over the
Falklands Islands.
   None of the British-Argentine negotiations nor the steps taken so
far imply any change in Argentina's clim to sovereignty over the
islands, Argentine delegate Juan Pablo Lohle told the OAS, which is
meeting in Asuncion, Paraguay.
   Britain has ruled the Falklands since 1833, but Argentina, which
calls the islands the Malvinas, claims it inherited them upon
declaring independence from Spain in 1810.
   Argentine forces in 1982 seized the Falklands, 300 miles off
Argentina's southeast coast, but a British task force retook the
islands during the 74-day war, in which 712 Argentines, 255 Britons
and three islanders were killed.
   A peace treaty was not signed until February.

<TEXT>
   Lawmakers took testimony Wednesday on a
bill intended to test the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision
legalizing abortion.
   A gynecologist who said she stopped performing abortions because
she felt like she was working in a slaughterhouse was among the
witnesses who appeared before the state House Criminal Justice
Committee.
   ``I just asked myself one day, `What am I doing ripping apart
these beautifully formed bodies?''' testified Dr. Beverly McMillan
of Jackson, Miss.
   The Louisiana Legislature has a history of enacting tough
abortion laws, all of which have been stayed or declared
unconstitutional over the past 15 years.
   Opponents of the latest bill acknowledge it will pass and be used
to take advantage of what anti-abortion activists hope is a
readiness on the increasingly conservative Supreme Court to reverse
its 1973 decision.
   The Supreme Court, in effect, ruled in Roe vs. Wade that ``nobody
can know at what moment life begins,'' geneticist Jerome Lejeune of
Paris testified Wednesday. But, in the past 17 years geneticists
have proven that ``the precise starting moment is the time that all
genetic information is gathered in the fertilized egg,'' Lejeune
said.
   That moment is conception, he said.
   Lejeune's testimony in a Tennessee case was instrumental in a
ruling last year that seven frozen embryos were human beings with
constitutional rights. That ruling will be considered by a state
appeals court.
   The committee was to hear testimony from opponents of the bill on
Thursday, then take action.
   Rep. Woody Jenkins, a leader of the anti-abortion effort, pleaded
with the committee not to amend the bill with exceptions, such as
for cases of rape and incest, which he said would be inconsistent
with past Louisiana law. The bill makes an exception only to save
the life of the mother.
   Gov. Buddy Roemer, a Democrat, has said he will veto any bill
that does not also make exceptions for victims of rape and incest
and to protect the health of the mother.

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Loyalist troops killed a commander of
rebels bearing down on the capital, and U.S. officials said
Wednesday they were arranging special flights to evacuate Americans
from Liberia.
   The special flights, which begin Saturday, would allow several
hundred American citizens to leave Liberia because of the
deteriorating situation there, said U.S. officials in Washington.
   The State Department is strongly urging the estimated 2,000
Americans in this West African nation to leave because of the
concerns about personal safety.
   Several miles off Monrovia, four U.S. warships carrying 2,000
Marines remained poised for a fourth day to evacuate Americans and
other foreigners, officials said.
   Another American official in Washington said President Samuel K.
Doe had asked for U.S. help. The Bush administration official,
speaking on condition of anonymity, corrected his earlier statement
that Doe had requested American help to leave Liberia.
   Diplomats in Monrovia said Doe had refused a U.S. offer of safe
passage.
   One Bush administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Doe had requested American help but was told by U.S.
diplomats he should attempt to reach some sort of accord with
insurgent leaders. The official earlier said Doe had asked for help
in getting out of the country, but he later amended his comment,
saying he knew only that Doe had asked for U.S. help.
   Doe met Tuesday with Christian and Moslem leaders who offered to
mediate between him and the rebels. The meeting was stormy, with Doe
angered by church leaders' suggestion he resign, an official source
said.
   Doe took over the country of 2.5 million people in a bloody coup
10 years ago. The rebels accuse his administration of corruption,
economic mismanagement and human rights abuses.
   Information Minister Emmanuel Bouwier and rebel forces on
Wednesday reported the death of the U.S.-trained rebel commander,
Elmer Johnson. Both sides gave no details of his killing.
   Johnson said he served with the U.S. military and was a member of
the American forces that invaded Grenada in 1983, though his claim
could not independently confirmed.
   Refugees reaching Monrovia, meanwhile, said rebels killed dozens
of Krahn and Mandingo civilians in their advance toward Monrovia, a
city of 400,000 people suffering widespread shortages of foodstuffs
due to the insurgency. An African ambassador said only that the
slayings occurred in several towns.
   One Mandingo woman said that in her town, rebels burst into a
mosque and began firing on people who spoke the Mandingo dialect.
``They just shot the people,'' she said.
   The civil war has pitted Mandingos and Krahns, who support Doe,
against Gio and Mano peoples, which back rebel leader Charles
Taylor. Troops supporting Doe, who is a Krahn, are accused of
killing hundreds of rebel supporters.
   The seeds of the ethnic war began in November 1985 when Brig.
Gen. Thomas Quiwonkpa, largely backed by Gios and Manos, tried to
overthrow Doe. Quiwonkpa managed to take over much of Monrovia
before he was killed.
   In revenge, hundreds of Gios and Manos were killed, according to
international human rights organizations.
   Taylor's rebels launched their invasion from eastern Nimba
County, the homeland of Gios and Manos. They have been within
striking distance of Monrovia since reaching the gates of
Robertsfield International Airport on Tuesday.
   In the past day, the rebels have made no attempt to advance.
   Since Monday, international carriers have refused to fly into the
airport, 25 miles from the capital.
   Retreating soldiers on Wednesday opened fire on two American
journalists at a roadblock at Scheiffelin Barracks, between the
capital and the airport. Neither man was wounded.
   ``They yelled at us and gesticulated with their guns saying give
us the car. We tried not to run and then got into the car, the
driver made a U-turn and then they fired at us, I think two, maybe
three, shots,'' said Stephen Smith, of Milford, Conn. He is a
reporter for the French newspaper Liberation. He said the shots did
not hit the car.
   ``We looked back and saw a soldier kneeling down and firing at us
_ it was not a warning shot,'' said Smith, who was accompanied by
Michael Roddy, a New York-based reporter for the Reuters news agency.
   Smith said they saw dozens of soldiers commandeering cars,
forcing passengers out, and crowded into the vehicles.
   On Tuesday, rebels captured a large rubber plantation and several
other government strongholds. Plantation residents said dozens of
rebels crossed the Farmington River _ the last natural barrier
before Monrovia _ and moved onto the huge Firestone Tire and Rubber
Co. plantation. The company is a subsidiary of Japan's Bridgestone
company.
   Residents said on Wednesday rebels gathered about 28 expatriates
managing the plantation and told them the installations would not be
damaged. Rebels ordered them to remain at home, residents said.
   Diplomats say about half the Liberian soldiers have deserted
since the fighting began Dec. 24, reducing the army to 3,000 to
4,000 men. That would be about the same size as the rebel army.
   Taylor had been a close aide of Doe, heading the government
agency responsible for disbursing public funds. He fled the country
after the Liberian leader accused him of stealing $1 million from
state coffers.
   Taylor denies the charges.

Agreement</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: INSERTS grafs 5-7: ``Biden asked,'' poison gas discussion</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chinese government still clamps down on
political freedom, bans labor demonstrations and imprisons
dissenters a year after the killings near Tiananmen Square in
Beijing, U.S. officials said Wednesday.
   Despite that, the Bush administration wants to retain trade
benefits for the Chinese government, a State Department official
told senators.
   Members of a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee clashed with
Richard H. Solomon, assistant secretary of State for East Asian and
Pacific Affairs, over the administration's China trade decision in a
prickly session.
   ``You really can't defend China here,'' Sen. Joseph Biden,
D-Del., told Solomon. ``You can't defend them on trade, you can't
begin to defend them on human rights. I find them absolutely
reprehensible in the way they have conducted themselves.''
   Biden asked Solomon about reports that China was providing
missiles and poison gases to the Middle East, and Solomon replied
that officials have received ``some indication that something might
be going on'' in regard to China's role in developing poison gas for
others.
   A congressional aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
there have been reports that China has helped Libya in the
production of poison gases.
   Solomon said U.S. officials have relayed to top Chinese officials
their concern over reports about Beijing's exports of warmaking
technologies to the Middle East. The Chinese have promised not to
sell missiles to Syria, he said.
   ``There are many evil regimes in this world today, but none more
deserves to be overthrown by its people than the one in Beijing,''
said Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.
   A number of lawmakers have promised an attempt to block President
Bush's decision to continue most favored nation trade status for
China for another year. The designation would allow the lowest
possible tariffs on Chinese goods.
   Solomon acknowledged the Bush administration is concerned about
events in China, a country where he said the ``underlying anger'' of
the citizens towards the regime remains great.
   Labor unrest is a particular serious problem for the Chinese,
prompting the government to raise salaries in an effort to contain
workers, Solomon said. At the same time, he said demonstrations are
banned.
   Solomon said also that U.S. officials are disturbed about reports
that the Chinese are using forced labor to work in factories,
including those that make clothing exports for the United States.
   Between 10,000 and 15,000 people were imprisoned after the bloody
massacre at Tiananmen Square, U.S. officials said. Today, some 2,000
remain in prison, although U.S. officials said their reporting
techniques were imprecise.
   U.S. officials have been disappointed by the Chinese government's
efforts to bring about reconciliation with students protesters,
Solomon said.
   Still, he added, Bush and his aides believe it would be
counterproductive to halt trade with China as a means of showing
disapproval.
   ``Our policy towards China seeks to encourage reform and human
rights through a considered mix of engagement and sanction,'' he
said. Should most favored nation trading status be withdrawn from
China, ``the real losers would be China's economic reformers and
workers in export industries,'' Solomon said.
   U.S. diplomats in Beijing believe most pro-democracy advocates
would object to Washington cutting trade ties with China, Solomon
said, but he acknowledged there were divisions of opinion among the
Chinese.
   Solomon also tried to play down the significance of most favored
nation status as a diplomatic tool. He pointed out, for instance,
that some other countries criticized for human rights violations _
among them Syria, Iraq and South Africa _ receive the same treatment.
   But Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said the argument for U.S.
engagement as a way to bring about reform was one that was rejected
by Congress when it imposed economic sanctions on South AFrica.
   The congressional hearing came as Chinese student leaders made
the rounds on Capitol Hill urging lawmakers to take ``concrete
actions'' to promote human rights in China.

<HEAD>Legislature Completes Work on School Finance Reform Compromise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PEGGY FIKAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State lawmakers finished work on a $528
million public school finance reform package Wednesday, sending it
to Gov. Bill Clements for his promised signature after months of
special sessions on education.
   ``I do think it's a good bill. I think it's a great step
forward,'' Clements said. ``We made some very significant changes in
the way we're going to do business in public education in the state
of Texas.''
   Lawmakers continued work on other bills but planned to end this
session _ a record sixth, and their fourth on court-ordered school
finance reform _ on Thursday. They have been meeting on education
since February.
   The funding reform package represents a compromise between
Democratic legislative leaders and the Republican governor for
meeting a state Supreme Court order to make more money available to
poor school districts.
   The House Wednesday approved 136-12 a bill outlining reforms in
school funding and administration. It also passed 142-2 a measure
making budget cuts and fund transfers to help raise money for
education and financially strapped social service programs.
   Both bills earlier passed the Senate.
   The House and Senate on Tuesday passed a fee-and-tax package to
raise the bulk of the $528 million for the school plan and about
$100 million for social services.
   The tax bill includes a quarter-cent boost in the state sales
tax, currently 6 cents on the dollar.
   Clements killed two previous school finance reform plans because
they each relied on a half-cent increase in the sales tax. But he
said he agreed to the quarter-cent increase to compromise and fend
off the prospect of a court-written funding plan for schools.
   ``I think that the quarter-cent sales tax will be dropped in due
course. I don't think that it's really necessary for school funding
for that to continue, and I'm optimistic that in the next ...
regular session, it will be dropped,'' Clements said. The
Legislature convenes in regular session in January.
   Some lawmakers said the legislation does not go far enough to
meet the court's order to develop a constitutional system. Rep.
Gregory Luna said that among other things, it includes no funding
for school facilities.
   ``Members, we will be back ... Don't fool yourself. We haven't
resolved the issue,'' Luna, a Democrat, told lawmakers.
   Clements said, ``I think that what we have passed here and what
we have agreed upon will more than satisfy the courts.
   ``That's my personal opinion, and being a non-lawyer and a
non-jurist and non-everything else, why, you know what my opinion is
worth,'' he added.
   The $528 million would be pumped during the 1990-91 school year
into the $13.5 billion-a-year school system, which relies on state
aid, local property taxes and some federal money.
   The package also includes increased testing of students;
exempting exemplary schools from certain state regulations, and
giving the governor authority to appoint the state education
commissioner, currently named by the state Board of Education.
   Texas is one of a dozen states where courts have overturned
school finance systems in recent years. The others are Kentucky, New
Jersey, Kansas, Wisconsin, California, Connecticut, Washington, West
Virginia, Wyoming, Arkansas and Montana.
   Clements, who is not seeking re-election, said he hopes lawmakers
will continue working to reform the education system.

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shining Path rebels exploded a car bomb on
Wednesday near the Government Palace, the second to hit downtown
Lima in 24 hours. Police said the attacks signaled a rebel offensive
against Sunday's presidential elections.
   Police said the blast destroyed a small car parked behind Lima
city hall and wounded one person.
   Hundreds of military police quickly swarmed through the area and
sealed off the Plaza de Armas in front of the palace.
   In Lima's middle-class Jesus Maria neighborhood, four rebels with
machine guns took over an electoral office, forced electoral workers
outside and set the office ablaze.
   Firefighters said electoral workers' identification and most
other documents were destroyed. The attack came four days before
runoff presidential elections pitting novelist Mario Vargas Llosa
against agricultural engineer Alberto Fujimori.
   The first car bomb exploded one block from the palace on Tuesday
night, seriously wounding a passer-by. Rebels launched a wave of
overnight violence around the capital.
   They blew up at least three high-tension power pylons, blacking
out parts of the capital and other coastal cities where most of
Peru's 22 million people live. Power was restored to most areas
within a few hours.
   In pre-dawn attacks Wednesday, guerrillas threw gasoline bombs at
a city bus and at a stove factory owned by a senator-elect of
Fujimori's Change 90 party, police said.
   They planted a bomb in the doorway of a public high school along
with a red flag with the hammer-and-sickle symbol of the
Maoist-oriented Shining Path. Police defused the device before it
exloded.
   Police said the attacks also may be in response to last week's
discovery of an elegant house in a Lima suburb apparently used as
the group's Lima headquarters. Police said the house may have been
used as a hideout by Abimael Guzman, Shining Path's founder and
leader.
   Police arrested 31 people in the raid last Friday and found
personal possessions that appeared to belong to Guzman, who has not
been seen in public in more than 10 years.
   More than 18,500 people have died in political violence since the
Shining Path began its insurgency in May 1980.

   The pathologist whose friends call him
``Dr. Death'' said Wednesday he had no regrets about his role in
ending the life of an Alzheimer's disease victim with a machine he
devised.
   ``Why shouldn't they call me that? Or even `Dr. Suicide?''' Dr.
Jack Kevorkian said during an interview at his home in this Detroit
suburb. ``Why should it bother me? Death is a concept. We're all
going to face it.''
   Janet Adkins flew 2,000 miles from her home in Portland, Ore., to
face death Monday afternoon in Kevorkian's 1968 Volkswagen van.
   Kevorkian, 62, and a relative drove with Mrs. Adkins to a park
where they attached her first to a heart monitor and then to an
intravenous tube.
   Mrs. Adkins, 54, pressed a button that delivered a muscle
relaxant and fatal doses of chemicals that put her into a coma, then
stopped her heart.
   Death came minutes afterward, said Kevorkian, who delivered the
body to police.
   ``Her last words to me were something like, `Thank you, thank you
very much,''' he said. ``I wished her a good trip, and as I leaned
over her she seemed like she was rising to meet me, perhaps to give
me a kiss of gratitude.''
   Kevorkian said Mrs. Adkins had asked him to publicize her method
of death to help others. Her dying wish was granted; Kevorkian's
name appeared Wednesday on the front pages of newspapers nationwide.
   ``I don't think I've broken a law,'' Kevorkian said. ``I don't
expect to be prosecuted, but you never know what happens in a highly
emotional society.''
   Oakland County Prosecutor Richard Thompson said Wednesday he has
yet to determine whether Kevorkian committed a crime. State police
impounded the retired pathologist's van.
   Thompson asked Circuit Judge Hilda Gage to issue a temporary
restraining order preventing Kevorkian from letting anyone else use
his device in the county. Gage scheduled a hearing on the request
for Friday.
   The Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulation on Wednesday
began investigating Kevorkian's role in Adkins' suicide, said Mary
MacDowell, director of the department's Health Investigation
Division.
   If the investigation determines that Kevorkian violated the state
public health code, the State Board of Medicine could impose
sanctions ranging from a reprimand to suspension or revocation of
the physician's medical license, McDowell said.
   Kevorkian's disdain of prosecution is matched by his scorn for
the medical profession, which he said is dominated by a Dark Ages
morality hostile to his pro-euthanasia views.
   ``Everyone says to me, `Hey, you're taking on yourself like God.'
Well, then, come on and do something,'' he said. ``If it's legal,
let me do it. If it's illegal, stop me.''
   The Pontiac native received his medical degree in 1952 from the
University of Michigan.
   He had developed a reputation as an outsider by the time he
completed his residency in 1958, said a colleague who has known him
for more than 40 years.
   ``He's had unique ideas. He thinks differently,'' said Dr. Murray
Levin, 60, of Bloomfield Hills. ``He wanted to use cadaver blood for
blood transfusions. That's something they maybe do in Russia.''
   ``He's always been a free thinker,'' said Dr. Gerald Abrams, a
former classmate of Kevorkian's and now a professor of pathology at
the University of Michigan medical school. ``He always impressed us
as being very bright, very sincere. His aren't exactly mainstream
ideas.''
   Kevorkian joined Pontiac General Hospital in 1959 and spent about
10 years there before opening a diagnostic clinic in Southfield. He
worked from 1969 to 1976 at Saratoga General Hospital in Detroit,
then at several small hospitals in the Los Angeles area before
returning to Michigan.
   Kevorkian, a bachelor, said he retired in 1982 to study ethics,
write articles for European medical and law journals and dabble in
surrealistic paintings with medical themes _ and titles like
``Nausea,'' ``Fever'' and ``Coma.''
   ``They're pretty powerful,'' Kevorkian said. ``They're not great
art but they've got a lot of impact. I like to shake people up.''
   But developing his suicide device has taken up the time he used
to spend painting.
   ``He's a loner,'' Levin said. ``He's dropped out of medical
circles as far as I know. It bothers me why a guy so competent and
well-abled is retired.''
   In 1988, Kevorkian asked the Hemlock Society, which advocates the
right to death on demand, to refer terminally ill members to a
center he wanted to open in California, said Derek Humphry, the
society's founder and executive director.
   ``I persuaded him not to take up in California,'' Humphry said by
telephone from the Netherlands, where he was presiding over a
convention of the World Federation of Right to Die Societies. ``We
didn't want to be involved in law-breaking.
   ``Dr. Kevorkian is to be praised for his courage and his
compassion,'' Humprhy said. ``The history of the world shows that it
sometimes takes a zealot to change people's thinking.''

<TEXT>
   MORGANTOWN, W.Va. _ A Hare Krishna swami said Wednesday the
federal racketeering and mail fraud charges against him are a ploy
to seize his 4,000-acre commune.
   ``Why else would they offer to drop the charges if I turned over
the land?'' Kirtanananda Swami Bhaktipada said in a telephone
interview from Washington.
   It was his first response since the indictment was issued by a
special grand jury in Elkins two weeks ago.
   ``I thought it was very strange that they would announce the
indictment while I was in India,'' the swami said. ``I didn't have
to come back. I'm innocent. I'm going to plead innocent. I'm going
to fight this.''
   Bhaktipada was charged with five counts of racketeering,
including conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire, and six counts of
mail fraud in an indictment handed up by a special federal grand
jury.
   One of the racketeering counts alleges a conspiracy involving the
death of Stephen Bryant, a dissident member of the Krishna community
gunned down on a Los Angeles street in May 1986.
   Another accuses Bhaktipada of authorizing the murder of Charles
St. Denis in 1983 on the grounds of Bhaktipada's New Vrindaban
community near Moundsville in the northern panhandle.
   A former New Vrindaban resident, Thomas Drescher, 40, was
convicted of the St. Denis murder and sentenced to life in prison
without parole. Drescher has also been charged with Bryant's murder.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An executive who once drew up a list of Jewish
officials for President Nixon did not attend a Wednesday dinner an
anti-Nazi organization inadvertantly invited him to.
   Controversy over the list had led Frederic Malek, president of
Northwest Airlines, to resign from George Bush's presidential
campaign in September 1988.
   The Simon Wiesenthal Center acknowledged last month that it
overlooked the matter when it invited Malek to be one of 30
vice-chairmen for an event honoring journalists who covered the
Nazis' genocide of Jews.
   ``Witness to the Truth'' awards were presented to CBS veterans
Andy Rooney, Eric Sevareid and Bill Shadel, syndicated columnist Max
Lerner and photographers Walter Rosenblum and Leon Rosenmann. Janet
H.B. Murrow accepted an award on behalf of her late husband, Edward
R. Murrow.
   Malek has told numerous Jewish groups that he is not anti-Semitic
and that he compiled the list under intense pressure from Nixon, who
thought a ``Jewish cabal'' was trying to undercut his record on the
economy. The list involved Jewish officials in the Bureau of Labor
Statistics in 1971.
   Malek accepted the center's offer to serve as a vice chairman and
his name appeared on invitations to the $500-a-plate dinner, but he
did not attend.
   Rhonda Barad, Eastern regional director of the Simon Wiesenthal
Center, said at least nine other vice chairmen were unable to come.
   She said Malek would have been welcome at the event.
   ``We consider Mr. Malek a very good friend of the Jewish
community,'' Barad said.
   She said he had contributed at least $2,500 to the center, a
human rights agency that provides information and guidance on the
Holocaust and Jewish issues.
   In remarks at the dinner, Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the center,
warned of efforts to alter or erase the Holocaust from history.
   Hier also said the Soviet Union is correct in demanding a say in
the unification of Germany. But, he said, so should Soviet Jews who
have lived ``as pariahs in a society that did not really want them.''

   A jury on Wednesday awarded comedian Pat
Paulsen $233,337 in damages in a lawsuit that accused his ex-wife of
diverting funds from his business while working as his booking agent.
   Paulsen joked after the award that it will help in in his next
whimsical campaign for the presidency.
   ``This makes me a more viable candidate, with a scandal, and this
is really a big one,'' he told the Rocky Mountain News in a
telephone interview from a hotel near Washington.
   Whether he ever collects any of the money is ``not the point,''
Paulsen said. ``It's a moral victory more than anything. Ten million
dollars wouldn't be worth all this hassle and all the stress.''
   Linda Chaney Paulsen, whose $162,000 counterclaim against the
comedian was rejected, was not in court Wednesday either.
   Contacted later, she told the News, ``I didn't do what I've been
accused of, which will become very clear in future legal
proceedings.''
   The Jefferson County District Court jury deliberated six hours
before reaching its verdict in the trial that began May 29.
   Paulsen had accused Linda Chaney Paulsen, whom he decided to
divorce two months after their 1988 marriage, of diverting up to
$200,000 in 1987 and 1988 from Pat Paulsen Enterprises Inc. of
Lakewood, where she was booking agent.
   He also claimed his ex-wife hid business records from him, leaked
harmful stories about him to the National Enquirer and faked
illnesses and nosebleeds to get his sympathy.
   In testimony in the case, accountant Robert Arshagouni said he
was aware the woman kept at least $157,000 more than she was
supposed to from Paulsen's performance fees.
   She denied the allegations, and filed a countersuit claiming
Paulsen married and divorced her simply to take over the business.
   Paulsen first gained national popularity on ``The Smothers
Brothers Comedy Hour,'' a 1960s TV show. Since then, he has
sporadically mounted tongue-in-cheek campaigns for president and
kept busy on the lecture circuit.

   A former church treasurer who allegedly
embezzled $267,000 and vanished eight years ago was arrested after a
member of the congregation spotted him at a New Mexico crafts show,
officials said Wednesday.
   ``The odds of finding him in Taos, New Mexico, are one in a
million or one in a billion,'' said District Attorney Kenneth
Gribetz.
   A detective who'd worked on the case and a priest from Christ
Episcopal Church flew to Taos and identified former treasurer Clyde
Womer, who'd taken a new name, Gribetz said. Womer was arrested
Tuesday.
   He was living with another woman, having left his wife and
children in Rockland County northwest of New York City, and was the
manager of a J.C. Penney store in Taos, Gribetz said.
   Womer, 67, waived extradition during a hearing Wednesday before
Magistrate Betty Gonzales in Taos.
   Gonzales ordered Womer held for New York authorities on a
fugitive warrant. He will be returned to New York, where he faces
six counts of grand larceny, the district attorney said.
   ``He denies doing it,'' said Taos Detective Sgt. Hidalgo
Trujillo. ``He said he wants to get back to New York as soon as
possible to straighten out this mess.''
   Womer disappeared in January 1982. A few days later, $267,000 was
discovered missing from the treasury of the church in Suffern.
   Gribetz said Womer had persuaded members of the church to put the
funds into liquid accounts, which he controlled. Womer then looted
the accounts, depositing the money in his own bank account, the
prosecutor said.
   Investigators were unable to trace Womer until last month, when a
church member told police she had seen him and spoken to him in
Taos, where she was attending a crafts fair.
   The woman said she did not let on she suspected the man was
Womer, but said he said he knew people in Rockland County.
   He was using the name Lawrence Krantz, which is his son-in-law's
name, Gribetz said. Gonzales said Womer also had used the name
Howard Simpson.
   Gribetz says that in addition to the identification by Detective
Leo Kosta and the Rev. John Andrews of the Christ Episcopal Church,
Womer was identified through a scar on his torso.
   Womer's assets were seized, Gribetz said, but he could not detail
them.

   Dianne Feinstein reached out for Democratic unity today after
winning her party's nomination for governor of California and
criticized Republican ``caretaker government.'' North Carolina
Democrats picked a black man to try to dethrone GOP Sen. Jesse Helms.
   But the biggest winner on a nine-state primary night Tuesday was
arguably Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi. Uncontested for the GOP
nomination, he also was assured of a third term when no candidate
ran in the Democratic primary.
   A half-dozen other senators gained nominations for new terms.
Democrats Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Howell Heflin of Alabama and
Max Baucus of Montana easily overcame challenges within their party,
while Democrat Tom Harkin of Iowa and Republicans Larry Pressler of
South Dakota and Pete Domenici of New Mexico were unopposed.
   Incumbent governors in Alabama, Iowa and South Dakota also were
renominated.

   New Jersey joined a dozen states where courts have struck down
school-funding systems for shortchanging the poor. In one of those
states, Texas, an education-finance overhaul package was speeding
through the Legislature.
   In a 7-0 ruling Tuesday, New Jersey's Supreme Court ordered
lawmakers to ensure by the 1991-92 school year that poor districts
are able to spend about as much per student as wealthier districts
in the 1.3 million-student system.
   The decision is widely expected to force lawmakers to raise
taxes, as has happened in Kentucky, Arkansas, Wyoming and other
states. Texas' House and Senate approved tax increases Tuesday.
   The wave of court orders rejecting the way states fund schools is
a legacy of the rich-get-richer, poor-get-poorer 1980s, one expert
said.

   Train ridership is up, small bus companies are
picking up more passengers and Lera Dwyer's van service is keeping
two dozen Texas towns linked to the big city.
   As Greyhound Lines Inc. tries to reorganize its finances under
bankruptcy laws while pledging to continue most service with
replacements for striking drivers, many travelers already are
finding ways to cope without America's only nationwide bus system.
   They may be paying more, waiting longer for connections and
resorting to other transportation modes, but few have complained to
Washington since 6,300 Greyhound drivers walked out March 2 in a pay
and job security dispute.
   ``I haven't received a single call from any legislator, mayor,
governor or anyone complaining about a lack of service because of
the Greyhound strike,'' said Wayne J. Smith, executive director of
the United Bus Operators of America.

in a town with a think tank on nearly every corner, a new kid on the

   According to its creators, the Economic Strategy Institute will
be the first research organization geared to the post-Cold War era,
a time when America's standing will be based not on its nuclear
arsenal but on its ability to compete economically with countries
such as Japan.
   ``When you consider the question of international trade and

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev may have
returned to Moscow bearing trade and arms agreements, but he and his
wife Raisa were laden with other souvenirs as well _ including two
of President Bush's horseshoes.
   Among the many gifts the Bushes gave the Gorbachevs during the
superpower summit was an orange pitching horseshoe mounted on a
wooden plaque.
   It was the lucky shoe that Gorbachev had tossed for a first-time
ringer at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland's
Catoctin Mountains, as he and his wife relaxed there last Saturday
with the Bushes.
   Bush presented the horseshoe plaque to Gorbachev at dinner that
night.

   Mary Wesley's mailbox is frequently filled
with letters from frustrated would-be novelists.
   ``I get letters from people who say they've always wanted to
write a book and they want to know how I did it,'' she says.
   At 77, Wesley is a newcomer to fiction. She published the first
of her seven novels when she was 70. Her latest, ``A Sensible
Life,'' topped the British best-seller list its first week of
publication, and will be published in the United States this summer.
   The diminutive author, dressed in navy blue sweatshirt, light
blue jeans and pearl earrings, had been writing for 40 years and
tearing up the pages, except for two children's books. She only
started writing seriously after her husband of 25 years, journalist
Eric Siepmann, died in 1970.
   ``My husband used to tell me I could write but I thought it was
just because he loved me,'' she said in an interview at her timbered
Elizabethan house in southwest England. ``I was unhappy, very poor.
Writing purged myself of the destructive desperation.''
   She describes writing as ``a compulsion. ... It's companionship,
but it's not always enjoyable. It can be painful and frustrating
like a dog digging at a rabbit hole, when the rabbit is long gone.''
   A friend persuaded her to find a publisher for her first novel,
``Jumping the Queue,'' a black comedy about a middle-aged widow on
the brink of suicide. It got enthusiastic reviews and sold
respectably.
   ``A Sensible Life'' traces the life of Flora, who achieves her
childhood ambition of loving three men she meets as a girl.
Abandoned by her self-absorbed parents, Flora matures into a tough,
confident and attractive woman and eventually, in middle age, she
settles down with one of the three men.
   Wesley captures the flavor of blacked-out wartime London, boozy
weekends at country houses, a lonely child's desperation. Her
description of Flora's feverish cold makes the reader sniffle.
   The book includes the ingredients Wesley fans have come to
expect: a carefully drawn wartime setting, upper-class English
characters, jaunty dialogue and racy scenes.
   ``People go on about sex in my books because I'm so old,'' Wesley
said. ``When I was 30 I thought that I wouldn't have sex when I was
40, and when I was 40 I thought I'd stop at 50 and so on, but sex
goes on no matter how old you are.''
   Her plots can be complicated, but her style is simple and
unadorned _ an attribute she says comes from her frugality with
paper in less prosperous times. ``I hate overwriting. The expense of
foolscap helped my writing. It made me more concise,'' she said.
   The author denies her vivid characters are modeled on herself.
But gutsy women from privileged backgrounds, unafraid to defy
convention, are consistent with Wesley's persona.
   Wesley, like Flora and Helena, dared to breach accepted behavior
and was divorced, as one of her characters would say, ``when it was
simply not done.''
   After the divorce, many suitors were interested, but it was
Siepmann who spotted her in the Ritz Hotel and gave her unbroken
happiness. Wesley still feels the loss. She often catches herself
making a mental note to tell Eric something amusing she has heard.
   Gardening, writing and answering fan mail fill her day.
   After an appearance on a popular radio program, she says, she got
three letters: ``One was an invitation to a literary lunch, the
second said if you're afraid to die, here are the phone numbers for
three clairvoyants and the third said they'd seen a picture of me,
admired my teeth, and wanted the name of my dentist.''
   Wesley said she is afraid of the process of dying, but not of
death itself.
   ``I'm interested to know what happens,'' she said. ``I cannot
believe there is nothing beyond and if there is then, well, that's
that.''
   She is energetic and swims three times a week. ``I don't feel
that old. I don't think about it,'' she said. ``I resent getting
tired, but I can see, hear and chew. I find it tiresome the way
people talk about their age and illnesses.''
   Publicity makes the author uncomfortable.
   ``I feel very overexposed,'' she said. ``It's a creepy feeling
because I'm used to observing others and now I'm being observed.''
   Her advice to those frustrated novelists who write to her is:
``read, read and keep on reading.'' Books have been her education.
But she cautions that writing is much harder than it may seem.
   ``I've been lucky,'' she says. ``I wouldn't recommend it for
anyone.''

<HEAD>Seminaries Include Wider Diversity Of Future Ministers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Enrollment in American seminaries, the source for
filling pulpits across the country, turned upward last term after
declining slowly but steadily for the past five years.
   There are now more older students involved, and more women.
   So far, the seminary output is about keeping up with the needs
for new ministers in Protestant denominations, but there's a
shortage in a growing number of Catholic dioceses.
   The new figures on seminarians were compiled by the Association
of Theological Schools, based in Vandalia, Ohio. It includes most
accredited Protestant and Roman Catholic seminaries in the country _
203 of them.
   Their total enrollment reached 56,083, up 5.1 percent over the
55,405 at start of the 1988-89 term, which had been the low point in
a gradual slide since 1984, when enrollment peaked at 56,466.
   While Roman Catholicism is experiencing priest shortages, most
major Protestant denominations are ``just about replenishing'' their
needs, says the Rev. William Baumgaertner, the association's
associate director.
   ``They're reasonably well supplied, but there's no great
surplus,'' he added in an interview.
   Noting signs that a growing proportion of the current crop of
seminarians plan careers other than the ordained ministry, he said:
   ``The sharp increase this year may well reflect the success of
school efforts to serve a broader constituency with a variety of
graduate level programs.''
   He said an increasing percentage of unordained, but trained
specialists ``now share responsibilities'' with clergy as music
directors, religious education leaders, pastoral counselors and
other ministries.
   ``The base of ministry has shifted away from all being ordained
to a lot of others who are not, but who have advanced degrees for
their specialities,'' Baumgaertner said.
   He said the prevelance of older students has remained high, with
the average age about 31. Many ``second career'' students, those
pursuing ordination after working in other fields, are in their late
30's or 40's.
   They make about a fourth of the entire seminary enrolment.
   The number of women students _ and their proportion of the total
_ stays on the upgrade, a trend that has gone on since 1972 when
they constituted only 10 percent of seminary students.
   At that time, women were a relatively small, but pioneering band
of 3,358. Now the total is five times greater _ 16,270. They amount
to 29 percent of the total seminarians, up 2 points in the last two
years.
   Their ranks are not growing, ``as rapidly as before,''
Baumgaertner said. But their steady increase has brought predictions
that a fourth of mainline Protestant pastors will be women by the
century's end.
   Most major Protestant bodies _ United Methodist, Episcopal,
Presbyterian, American Baptists, Lutheran and Reformed _ now admit
women to ordination, although they're barred from it in Roman
Catholicism and Eastern Orthodxy.
   Among Southern Baptists, it's a controversial issue, but some of
their congregations have ordained women.
   Black students in seminary have increased steadily for two
decades, the gain averaging 5.5 percent per year for the past five
years, and now totalling 3,814.
   Blacks now make up 6.8 percent of the total seminary enrolment,
compared to 4.2 percent a decade ago.
   ``There is reason for encouragement in these statistics,''
Baumgaertner said.
   However, he said, the increase in Hispanic seminarians has been
too slow to meet the needs, up only 2.8 percent to a total of 1,483.
   ``Continuing efforts of denominations to reach out to this group
will be a challenge to the existing programs of theological
schools,'' he said.
   Students of Pacific@Asian ancestry have increased much more
rapidly and their total of 2,058 now exceeds that of blacks. ``The
determination of this group to provide an educated ministry is
obvious,'' Baumgaertner said.
   Despite overall seminary growth, the number of full-time students
continued to drop, now totalling 36,431, or 65 percent, down 3.5
percent in the last two years. The proportion has declined 11
percent in the last decade from 76 percent.
   ``Schools have been focusing their energies on increasing
endowment for student financial aid in order to reverse this trend
and to permit more applicants to become full-time students,''
Baumgaertner said.
   ``It is obvious that more needs to be done.''

<TEXT>
   Jose Espinosa fled Fidel Castro's Cuba in 1961 with
$10 in his pocket. He now heads a $3 million-a-year company that
caters to Latins by operating up to 15 buses daily between Miami and
New York.
   English is a second language on Espinosa's La Cubana buses,
except for the movies on the overhead VCR system that entertain
riders traveling the 1,300 miles on Interstate 95.
   Like many Cuban exiles, Espinosa settled in Miami for what he
thought would be a temporary stay.
   ``After Castro took over, everybody I knew who came to Miami
agreed Fidel would be out of power within months. Everybody was
mistaken,'' he said of the Cuban strongman, in power since 1959.
   Espinosa came to Florida alone, but was able to get his wife and
young daughter out of Cuba when it became apparent Castro's reign
would not be short. His parents and most other relatives eventually
moved to Miami, too.
   His business began with a simple notion: that many of the Cuban
exiles who traveled between New York and Miami to visit relatives or
work feared using a carrier that conducted business only in English.
   ``He saw that Spanish-speaking people weren't getting the service
they need,'' said Espinosa's daughter, Rosa Theodorou, manager of
the company's New York-area branch office in Union City, N.J.
   But getting the bus business off the ground proved to be a
decade-long fight. Espinosa applied for a permit from the Interstate
Commerce Commission, but bus-giant Greyhound Lines Inc. opposed him,
and the battle dragged on until 1978, when Espinosa finally
convinced the commission his line would be unique.
   ``I proved to the (commission) judge that there was a market for
my service that other companies weren't providing,'' he said. ``Our
passengers were not like other passengers. Our passengers didn't
speak English. They couldn't talk to the drivers.''
   To make ends meet, Espinosa worked at a freight-forwarding
company, unloading goods and driving trucks.
   And he began shuttling passengers without a license. In an old
station wagon, he picked up fellow exiles in Miami at their doors
before dawn, drove all day and night to the New York area, dropped
them off, and then reversed the whole trip within days.
   ``It was so much work,'' he said. ``That was before I had the
permit. I wasn't supposed to do it, but I needed to make a living.''
   Espinosa likened his pre-license hustling to Nicaraguan vendors,
new to the country, who today sell fruit on the streets of Miami's
Little Havana section without a permit.
   ``It was a way to bring some food to the home,'' he said.
   Through word-of-mouth, his business grew. He bought a van and
attached a trailer to carry passengers' possessions. Once, weary
from a long haul to New York and a quick turnaround, he forgot to
lock the trailer door, only to discover in South Carolina that the
goods had been strewn somewhere earlier along I-95.
   He was on the road constantly to meet demand, so Espinosa
expanded again, buying a bus that he drove for years until singer
Andy Williams purchased it for his tours, his daughter said.
   Now the business is established and Espinosa, 71, no longer has
to drive for a living. He has about 25 employees, including
bilingual reservation clerks who answer phones in New York and
Miami. Cubana, in step with the times, has a toll-free 800-number.
   The company has at least two buses on the road daily between
Miami's Little Havana and New York, and up to 15 traveling each day
during the busiest season _ Christmas and July.
   ``I don't know why the Latins pick July to spend the month in
Miami Beach,'' Espinosa said with a laugh.
   He advertises on Spanish TV and radio in the Miami and New
York-New Jersey markets, but Cubana generates most of its traffic
from satisfied customers.
   ``They feel like they're in a family atmosphere,'' said Ms.
Theodorou.
   Passengers on a recent trip southward were unanimous in their
praise.
   ``I like the music, and it's a fun atmosphere,'' said Katia
Chamah, 18.
   But at $69 each way, the trip isn't much cheaper than the lowest
airfares; some air carriers have restricted one-way fares between
Miami and the New York-area as low as $79. And Greyhound's fares
range from $68 to $99, one way.
   Many Latins, however, fear flying, said Ruben Dario Lugo, a Miami
security guard who boarded the bus at Cubana's small storefront in
Manhattan, even though the trip takes an entire day and sometimes
longer if there are any breakdowns along the way.
   ``The thing to remember is if this falls,'' Lugo said, patting
the seat of the bus on a recent journey, ``it doesn't fall nearly as
far as a plane.''
   Added Ms. Theodorou, ``We tell them, `If you were on a plane and
it broke down, you wouldn't be here to tell us.'''

   ABOARD CUBANA BUS NO. 8801 (AP) _ The trip is already four hours
behind schedule when the bus leaves its Union City, N.J., terminal
for Florida. No one seems to mind.
   Passengers sip thimbles of sweet black Cuban coffee as the bus
rumbles onto Interstate 95.
   ``Musica, musica!'' shouts someone from the rear of Cubana bus
No. 8801, which is carrying 34 passengers 1,300 miles southward.
Luis Niebla looks at his co-driver, Osvaldo Rodrigues, smiles and
puts on a cassette tape of Roberto Carlos, a Latin singer.
   Rodrigues takes out a microphone and in Spanish tells the
passengers what's ahead: at least 22 hours on the highway, including
dinner at a Latin cafe, a stop in Washington, D.C., to pick up
passengers, breakfast in north Florida, and arrival in Miami the
next afternoon.
   He warns passengers no drinking is allowed on board, or drugs,
and that anybody in violation will be turned over to the highway
patrol.
   As the bus heads down the highway, Carlos croons on, ``En otras
palabras, yo soy un romantico,'' or ``In other words, I'm a
romantic.'' An hour later, the bus stops in Elizabeth, N.J., for
dinner at El Pimiento Rojo, a Salvadoran cafe with its menu painted
in Spanish on the wall.
   The drivers quaff down a yerba mate (Latin tea) soda, and
passengers order bacalao (codfish), carne asada con arroz blanco
(roast beef with white rice) and frijoles negros (black beans). We
seem far from America already.
   Back on the road, Niebla puts on a videotape of the movie
``Aliens.'' Most are quiet on board as the bus crosses into Delaware
at sunset, except Ruben Dario Lugo, a night security guard who has
been chatting with passengers almost nonstop since he got on board.
   ``I talk a lot, don't I? There's no one to talk to in my work and
when I get home every day, I sleep,'' says Lugo, born to Puerto
Rican parents in New York and now living in Miami.
   Night sets in, and people straggle up front for a shot of Cuban
coffee from a Thermos. A Philadelphia radio station plays oldies as
we cross into Maryland. A Venezuelan girl walks by wearing a ``Who
Killed Roger Rabbit'' T-shirt.
   ``Avenging Force,'' a violent B-grade film about a secret white
supremacist society involved in killings in Louisiana, comes on, and
again the bus quiets, most passengers transfixed by the TV screen
above Niebla.
   A slim crescent of moon rises in the sky; soon the bus exits at
Chevy Chase, Md., and heads into Washington, D.C., to pick up a
family of four.
   ``A lot of people travel with us because they're afraid to fly,''
says Niebla, whose bus was delayed by a breakdown on the previous
run. ``It's not just the Latins either; we get some Haitians, too.''
   Katia Chamah, 18, comes up front as we pass the lighted Lincoln
Memorial and Washington Monument; she and Niebla, 33, begin talking,
mostly in Spanish. They switch easily between the two languages.
   She speaks of vacations, her college studies and dreams of a
career as a forensic psychologist. Niebla talks of fishing in the
Florida Keys and serving in the U.S. military.
   We pass Richmond, Va.; it's been six hours on the road. The seven
children on board seem well-mannered, and none of the adults are
misbehaving.
   Cuban-born Niebla says he fled to Florida with his parents in
1967. His father, a schoolteacher, had opposed Fidel Castro, and
been publicly scorned by the Cuban government. His mother helped the
anti-Castro underground, Niebla says.
   ``She used to stick ammo in her shirt and take it to people
hiding out in the mountains,'' he says.
   The heads of the sleeping passengers bob in the night. Daylight
comes in a light fog in southern Georgia. The bus pulls into a truck
stop for breakfast outside Jacksonville, Fla., then it's back on the
road for the final run to Miami.
   At this point in the trip, most of Florida looks the same _ mile
after mile of palmettoes, palms and wild Brazilian pepper trees.
   The bus continues on to West Palm Beach, where a few passengers
are let off. Many of the remaining travelers order coffee,
sandwiches and pastries from the adjacent Cuban diner.
   Weary, most everyone is quiet when the bus pulls into the
one-room Cubana terminal, which has a faded map of Cuba on one wall,
in the Little Havana section of Miami.
   Niebla is rewarded by Chamah with a bag full of tips she
collected from he passengers as the bus pulled into Miami. He's
greeted by his wife and one of his daughters, who clings to him.
   ``He's on the road so much,'' his wife says, wringing her hands.

<HEAD>U.S.-Soviet Trade Policy Not a Model of Consistency</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As a lesson in capitalism, U.S. policy on trade
with Moscow loses something in the translation. In this case,
business doesn't come before pressure.
   Commercial decisions hinge on Soviet behavior and on American
politics, not on the marketplace.
   And consistency is not part of the package.
   Pressing Soviet trade, the old communist, Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
argued like a businessman, the course that now suits his economic
purpose. He told political leaders in Washington and business
leaders in Minneapolis and San Francisco that if American traders
and investors don't move quickly into newly opening Soviet markets,
other interests will be there first.
   That concerns administration officials, but they also have to
deal with political realities, one of which is that Congress will
not agree to a new trade deal until Moscow offers at least a gesture
toward granting Lithuania independence.
   The trade agreement Gorbachev took home from the summit was
described by the White House as a symbol of support for Soviet
economic change, but it is only a symbol; it will not be completed
any time soon.
   The Soviet parliament may put off until fall its final action on
an emigration law President Bush said must be enacted before he
sends the trade deal to Congress. Even when that step is taken, the
agreement is not going anywhere without some easing in Gorbachev's
economic crackdown on Lithuania.
   At same time, a renewed grain sales agreement is taking effect
without regard to Kremlin behavior on Lithuania's independence drive
or anything else.
   The five-year grain deal extends agreements dating from 1976.
U.S. negotiators wanted that one. It is an economic boon to the
Midwest, it expands the business American farmers already are doing,
and putting it in any doubt would be politically perilous.
   When then-President Carter imposed a partial grain embargo in
1980 to punish the Soviet Union for the invasion of Afghanistan,
Republicans denounced the step.
   They said wheat should not have been made a diplomatic weapon,
argued that Moscow would simply buy its grain elsewhere. Ronald
Reagan lifted the embargo shortly after he became president.
   The trade agreement, and the most-favored-nation tariff status
Gorbachev wants, are new business, and politically vulnerable, with
no domestic constituency involved. The grain sales are big business,
with powerful U.S. voting interests behind them. Soviet negotiators
apparently didn't want to sign the grain deal unless the trade deal
also was signed.
   Grain sales, including wheat sold at subsidized prices, account
for most current U.S. trade with the Soviet Union. Under the new
agreement those sales are supposed to increase to $6 to $8 billion a
year.
   Soviet exports to the United States did not reach $1 billion last
year.
   The trade agreement could open the path to greatly expanded
commerce between the two powers, although at this point the Soviet
Union does not have much to sell. Its major U.S. exports now are
vodka, caviar and furs, all subject to steep tariffs that would be
sharply reduced by most-favored-nation treatment.
   The trade deal also would make it easier for U.S. companies that
want to do business in the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev's bottom line was a businessman's: there's money to be
made, and the people who get there first will do best.
   ``We need some economic moves, some economic steps now,'' he said
during the summit visit. ``If America lags behind, then others come
in ... We want America to be in.''
   He argued his case for the trade deal to congressional leaders
and in his summit sessions with Bush, who finally offered the
gesture of a conditional agreement. Congressional critics called it
a cave-in on Lithuania. The Senate had voted 73-24 on May 1 for a
resolution saying that there should be no trade agreement without an
end to the economic crackdown on Lithuania.
   Sen. George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, the majority leader, said
Monday that Bush clearly expected Congress to do what he wouldn't
do, and tie trade to Soviet moves toward Lithuanian independence,
not only to free emigration. The latter condition dates from 1974;
it was set by Congress to press for emigration rights for Soviet
Jews.
   Bush also faces a trade policy dispute over his renewal of
favorable tariff terms for China despite its repression of democracy
demonstrators and the killings in Tiananmen Square a year ago.
Congressional critics are trying to block the extension, but they
probably lack the votes.
   Bush had said his action on China sent no message except that
isolation is bad and economic development is good.
   The U.S. message on Soviet trade terms isn't quite the same.

<TEXT>
   These are halcyon days for Fox Broadcasting Co.
   In the latest Nielsen ratings, the television network that
refuses to call itself one broke into the top 10 for the first time
in its young life.
   ``The Simpsons'' was the No. 4 show in the country last week,
``Married ... With Children'' was No. 11 and ``In Living Color''
placed 19th. Never before in its four-year existence has Fox placed
three shows in the top 20.
   At its annual convention this week for affiliated stations, Fox
is beside itself.
   So what's an upstart network to do?
   Well, try not to let it go to your head, for starters. Or at
least, don't let it look like it's going to your head. And when you
roll out your fall schedule, don't let it appear that you're going
toe-to-toe with the big boys, even though you are.
   Before about 600 advertisers, affiliate representatives and
reporters Monday, Fox trotted out sneak peeks and the stars of its
fall lineup.
   Out came Keenen Ivory Wayans and his brother, Damon, whose ``In
Living Color'' skits include black, gay, limp-wristed film reviewers
giving movies ``two snaps up'' and the ``Homeboy Shopping Network,''
featuring two black thieves auctioning stolen goods.
   Also on the stage of the Beverly Hilton's Versailles ballroom
were two of the stars of the new ``Babes'' situation comedy about a
triumvirate of extremely large sisters who are ... well, they're
fat. And they make jokes about it.
   There were Fox executives talking about Fox being ``unique,''
``special,'' ``young'' and ``high-octane TV,'' and about how, with a
recent Federal Communications Commission waiver in hand, the network
has bumped its programming to 18{ hours without being bound by
federal network rules.
   But probably the most talked about and written about aspect of
the upcoming season is Fox's decision to put the grousing, animated
Simpsons up against kingpin Bill Cosby and ``The Cosby Show'' on
NBC. ``The Simpsons'' actually placed four slots higher than Cosby
last week, with both programs still in their original time periods
on separate nights.
   ``Cos is gonna have a cow, dude,'' screamed last week's headline
in the L.A. Daily News. ``Fox's Family Feud,'' wrote the San
Francisco Chronicle.
   But Peter Chernin, head of the Fox Entertainment Group, says no
way, man. The point is not to beat Cosby. The point is to walk into
no man's land and settle for second.
   ``We'll be happy to be No. 2,'' Chernin said Monday in an
interview at the Beverly Hilton.
   Because Cosby has owned the 8 p.m. EDT Thursday slot for the last
few years, ABC and CBS simply walked away, Chernin said. And now,
with rumors abounding that the fall season will be Cosby's last on
the show, Fox strutted in with its top-rated program.
   ``If Bill does leave after this year,'' Chernin said, ``then
we'll step in.''
   Fox does not, Chernin said, expect to beat Cosby in the fall.
   Rather, it's just one more example of ``guerrilla warfare,'' a
phrase Chernin is partial to using when describing his network. Uh,
make that broadcasting company.
   With only 131 stations across the country carrying Fox
programming (compared to top-rated NBC, which has 208 affiliate
stations), the success of Fox really does seem like a guerrilla war.
   Couple that with the fact that it's not always easy to find the
Fox station in your hometown _ especially if you live in, say,
Lexington, Ky., where the Fox affiliate is WDKY, located on channel
56.
   Overcoming such obstacles is not lost on Fox, which spared no
expense in wining and dining its affiliates.
   ``Fox is no longer an alternative,'' the affiliates were told
amid much fanfare. ``Now, it's an essential.''
   Lest they get too carried away with themselves, Fox executives
did try to put a mute in their horn-blowing.
   ``We believe in taking risks,'' Chernin told the packed ballroom.
``Next, we believe in aggressiveness. We can't afford to get
comfortable. We've got to keep challenging ourselves.''

   Television might make your brain cry out for
sustenance, but it could be worse for couch potatoes if it inspires
them to down the same junk they see actors eating on TV shows at
night.
   No kidding, that's the opinion of a study that analyzed the food
content of 11 top network shows and almost burped in dismay.
   ``The prime-time diet is inconsistent with dietary guidelines for
healthy Americans,'' says a summation of the study, published in
this month's issue of the American Journal of Public Health.
   The study, conducted in the summer of 1988, was designed to
examine whether what we see eaten on TV has any impact on what we
eat. Could be, it concluded. ``However,'' it added, ``this is
speculative and further research is needed.''
   But the report makes clear that such good-for-you eats as wheat
germ, apples, spinach, fish and even the mighty banana get short
shrift in prime time.
   The study finds that 60 percent of all food references in the
studied shows ``were for low nutrient beverages and sweets.''
   A big boo to you, Mr. TV Producer.
   The food references don't include the 261 commercials found here
and there in the shows. But they, too, indicate TV has become Munchy
City.
   The study says 35 percent of the ads were for food, with
fast-food wares _ hamburgers, fried chicken, pizza and breakfast
sandwiches _ leading the pack.
   The shows analzyed for their depictions of TV dining ranged from
``Who's the Boss'' to ``The Golden Girls'' from ``Murder She Wrote''
to ``ALF.''
   Even ``L.A. Law,'' which often has a fruit bowl on its conference
table to indicate the series is about a Los Angeles law firm, got
the gimlet eye.
   All this analyzing proved a veritable Tums festival, finding that
references to food occurred an average of 4.8 times per half-hour
for a grand total of 134 food references. For what it's worth, fish
got only one mention, but then, so did muffins.
   The report takes care to note that ``verbal references using food
in a figurative sense, such as referring to someone as `the big
cheese,' were not included.''
   Moving right along now, the study found 86 occasions of eating or
drinking on the shows, and much of that was as ``stage business.''
   (Stage business consists of such things as shuffling, smoking an
iguana, crossing the eyes, tap-dancing or firing off a howitzer when
the script is so dumb actors must do something to look busy.)
   Almost three-fourths of the food eaten on the shows are ``eaten
between meals,'' with sweets the most popular, the study says.
Sweets had a 44 percent consumption rate, whereas fruits and
vegetables had a combined total of only 9 percent.
   The formal-dining analysis included the category of entrees,
which among other things, the study says, consisted of ``stir-fry
vegetables and chicken which the children refused to eat.''
   Let's hear it for the kids.
   But their parents should turn off the TV set and make them read.
Or take them to a play, maybe something by Shakespeare.
   Not ``Twelth Night,'' though. No one has conducted a food
analysis of it, but it does have a character who would be ideal to
conduct such a study. Better yet, he could have a go at the art of
dining on TV.
   His name is Sir Toby Belch.

<HEAD>Money Markets Get A New Look</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In these risk-averse times, many savers and
investors are shopping for more than just high yields when they look
for money-market investments.
   By all the evidence, they are paying extra attention these days
to the fine distinctions among competing alternatives like Treasury
bills, bank certificates of deposit, and money-market mutual funds.
   Each of these popular savings vehicles enjoys a long-standing
reputation for safety, and nothing has happened lately to alter that
description in any drastic way.
   Nevertheless, many financial analysts say, the relative merits of
each species are getting a new appraisal these days in the wake of
such developments as the government bailout of failed savings
institutions and a general post-1980s tightening of credit standards.
   ``There is a flight to quality from bank CDs and commercial paper
(short-term debt issued by corporations) into Treasury bills,'' says
the savings newsletter 100 Highest Yields.
   T-bills, which are sold by the federal government in three-month,
six-month and one-year maturities, are widely considered to rank
among the safest paper investments available anywhere in the world.
   Most bank CDs also are government-backed, in the form of deposit
insurance of up to $100,000. However, the S&amp;L crisis has prompted a
debate over how far Uncle Sam can and ought to go in the future in
standing behind the banking system.
   Investors in money funds have no direct government protection.
But the funds can strive for safety through diversification of their
portfolios and sticking with securities of top-rated borrowers,
including the Treasury. They also rank high in liquidity and
convenience.
   Money funds have come under increased scrutiny in the past year,
however, from both regulators and private commentators, because of
defaults by a couple of issuers of commercial paper.
   In those instances, sponsors of several money funds dug into
their own pockets to make up for losses that would have at least
marginally and temporarily reduced the funds' yields.
   This spring has brought a pause in what was a steady advance of
money-fund assets to record highs. In April, according to the
Investment Company Institute, the total in short-term mutual funds
dropped to $459.2 billion from $463.6 billion the month before.
   While payments of income taxes were partly responsible, said
Jacob Dreyer, chief economist at the trade group, he also said
investors ``purchased large amounts of newly offered Treasury bills
and notes by drawing on their money market fund balances.''
   If this shift was inspired first of all by a safety-first
philosophy, it drew further encouragement from an unusual pattern in
market rates. Yields on T-bills, which typically stand slightly
lower than the competition, right now are very competitive.
   As of early this month, listings in Barron's magazine showed the
yield on 26-week Treasury bills at 8.17 percent, compared to
six-month CDs at an average of 7.75 percent and money market funds
at an average of 7.68 percent.
   It appears, analysts say, that banks and money funds have made
some concessions toward safety in their usual competitive efforts to
offer top yields.
   Whether of their own volition or in response to regulatory
prodding, they have tightened the standards they apply to the credit
risks they are willing to take. That generally means accepting a
lower yield.
   In addition, T-bill yields are not affected by the management and
operating costs that take a slice out of the returns banks and money
funds can offer.
   Savers and investors who buy T-bills from a bank or broker may
see their effective returns reduced by transaction charges or
custodial fees. New Treasury securities can be bought with no such
charges, however, by dealing directly with a Federal Reserve bank or
branch.

<HEAD>RJR Grant Brings Hope To Western N.C. Elementary School</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL NOWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROSMAN, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teachers at Rosman Elementary School had a
bold plan to transform their school into a highly unusual learning
center where parents and students could study side by side.
   Such a center, they believed, might help break the cycle of
poverty and illiteracy in their Appalachian community.
   But like many good ideas, it lacked an essential ingredient:
money.
   That's changed since the tiny school became one of 15 across the
nation awarded grants from the RJR Nabisco Foundation's $30 million
``Next Century Schools'' program _ the largest corporate educational
grant program ever for the benefit of elementary and secondary
schools.
   Rosman Elementary, with 364 students in grades K-6, will receive
$750,000 over the next three years as part of the tobacco and food
giant's program designed to promote daring, even risky, changes in
education.
   The RJR grant program was announced last year, and winning
schools got their first awards in April.
   ``It's a dream come true,'' said Exie Henson, who teaches second
and third grade at Rosman Elementary.
   The grant will be used to broaden the mission of the school, to
help kids by helping their parents, many of whom have severe social,
economic and educational problems of their own.
   ``Thirty-six percent of our kids are considered high-risk,'' said
Principal Dawson Hogsed. ``And so many of them have parents who also
dropped out.''
   The school will transform itself into a parent-child learning
center, complete with computers, where single mothers can obtain
quality child care while they take college courses.
   Parents who never learned to read will be able to take classes at
the school. They will be encouraged to come to the library any time,
day or night, to spend time with a book with their children.
   The school also will be a place where women, including teen-age
girls, can get quality prenatal care.
   School officials envision a community center where people can get
all kinds of assistance without having to drive 20 miles to the
nearest large town.
   ``Our campus could be open 24 hours a day,'' said Hogsed.
   More than 1,000 schools applied for the RJR grants. Nine of the
15 awards went to schools in Washington D.C., North Carolina and New
Jersey, where the company has operations.
   ``Of course, some of the new programs we fund won't work,'' said
Roger Semerad, president of the RJR Nabisco Foundation. ``But that's
a risk we are willing to take because we understand that true
innovation and creativity always entails risking failure.''
   Among the other schools receiving grants, the Bell Multi-Cultural
High School in Washington D.C., will purchase state-of-the-art
technologies and extend the school year.
   At Stanley Elementary School in Kansas City, Kan., teachers and
students will stay together for a three-year period, with the idea
that the longer-than-usual contact will promote learning.
   University Terrace Elementary School in Baton Rouge, La., will
use its grant to involve parents in educational planning, put
students of different ages in the same class and free teachers from
paperwork.
   In Portland, Ore., Davis Elementary School will use the recess
period and after-school hours to teach students and their parents
math skills.
   ``This is not do-goodism,'' RJR Nabisco Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Louis Gerstner said when the grants were
announced. ``This is in my self-interest, as well as my employees.''
   Gerstner said he expects some of the initiatives to fail because
they represent such radical changes in public education.
   ``RJR Nabisco is, in effect, providing $30 million of venture
capital to enable risk takers in education to break up the
institutional gridlock that has stifled innovation and creativity,
and to implement bold ideas that would never be successful without
outside support,'' he said.
   At Rosman, the challenge will be convincing enough parents to use
the planned new facility. Residents of this town, like many mountain
communities, are fiercely proud when it comes to unsolicited offers
of help.
   ``The parents are intimidated,'' said Barbara Hyatte, who teaches
high-risk students in the fifth and sixth grades. ``I have a lot of
trouble getting my parents to come in.''
   One out of five students at Rosman comes from a single-parent
home. Nearly 40 percent are poor enough to qualify for the free
lunch program.
   ``We did a survey of our students and we found that 30 percent
have at least one parent who did not finish high school,'' said
Hogsed. ``That's 30 percent of the entire school, not just the
high-risk students. And 55 percent of them had at least one
grandparent who did not graduate.''
   The principal, a native who attended Rosman Elementary and the
high school right down the street, and his faculty of 17 teachers
hope to enhance the education of their students by addressing their
social problems.
   ``Our parents provide for their kids by doing without
themselves,'' said Hogsed. ``We want them to help their children
realize the importance of education.''

<HEAD>A Regulatory Credit Crunch</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many real estate and building people feel a new
scourge has been let loose upon the American economy: Regulators.
   Those regulators, they feel, are sometimes overzealous,
irritating, intimidating and arbitrary, and they wonder occasionally
if the activities of regulators might not even tip the economy into
recession.
   While that possibility might seem far-fetched at this point,
David Seiders, chief economist of the National Association of Home
Builders, asks that very question in an analysis for an association
publication.
   And Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board,
pointedly has suggested to bankers that they remain prudent rather
than reactionary.
   Many of the real estate-building critics now concede that there
might not be a traditional credit crunch _ that the Federal Reserve
might be right in saying there is enough money out there _ but they
add a big ``but.''
   The big ``but'' is this: Isn't it the same thing as a credit
crunch if the banks have the money and, because of more critical
supervision by regulatory officials or their own lending officers,
they are unwilling to lend it?
   Seiders says there is indeed a crunch, a ``regulatory credit
crunch.''
   On Feb. 8, for example, the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency, or OCC, issued an advisory letter to chiefs and directors
of all national banks entitled ``Real Estate Project and Development
Lending.''
   This letter cited ``fundamental deficiencies and negative
trends'' in bank real estate lending during 1989 and warned about
problems of loan underwriting, appraisal practices and inadequate
risk analysis.
   The result, says Seiders, was to ``throw a deep chill over the
source of credit that we were counting on to help fill in for the
thrifts,'' which of course have their own regulatory and lending
problems.
   All of a sudden, he says, builders and developers from markets as
diverse as New England, Virginia and California reported that banks
``have simply closed their real estate lending windows.''
   Seiders says the banks explain that ``armies of supervisors have
them so uptight that real estate lending is just not worth the pain
when there are plenty of other investment alternatives.''
   Despite official denials that a credit crunch exists, the
National Association of Realtors is just as certain there is, based
on member reports. It routinely reports on ``the credit crunch'' in
its publications.
   It quotes its own chief economist, John Tuccillo, as saying that
poor financial practices of savings and loans have given rise to a
new zeal among many banking regulators.
   He suggests it isn't only the regulators involved in the
crackdowns, but lenders too. Fearful of the feds, he says, many
lenders operate in a tense environment of self-regulation. In short,
they avoid problems by not lending.
   Much of the regulatory zealousness originates with the savings
and loan debacle and daily stories of commercial real estate loans
gone bust. In almost every such story, regulators are criticized for
not having done their jobs.
   While there is little evidence that home mortgage delinquences
are on an upward trend, the residential market might also suffer.
Realtor News, a weekly publication, quotes one Realtor as explaining:
   ``If you had a late payment somewhere or a delinquency, lenders
used to just ask for a letter of explanation, but now they just say
no.''

   U.S. religious groups said they suffered a
setback this week when the Supreme Court let stand its decision
allowing states to ban use of peyote in worship by the Native
American Church.
   A wide cross-section of religious forces, mainline and
evangelical, conservative and liberal, Jewish and Christian, had
asked the court to reconsider the decision.
   The court turned down the petition without comment, disappointing
the various religious bodies.
   Henry Siegman, executive director of the American Jewish
Congress, said ``Native Americans suffer most directly'' by the
court's stand, ``but ultimately the liberty of all Americans has
been diminished.''

   The new bishop of the Nebraska Synod of the
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America says churches must become
creative if they want to increase their attendance on Sunday
mornings.
   Bishop Richard N. Jessen, installed in ceremonies at the synod's
convention, noted that denominational membership has declined 8
percent to 10 percent every decade for the past 25 years in ELCA
churches in the Midwest.
   ``If we continue to do church as usual, we're going to continue
that downhill slide,'' he said. ``People who aren't involved in
church at this time aren't all necessarily dead set against it.
Surveys show that half wouldn't mind being in church, but they
haven't been invited.''

   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ The chairman of the Southern Baptist
Foreign Missions Board has questioned the ``timing and conclusions''
of board president, the Rev. R. Keith Parks, in saying
denominational controversy has hurt mission efforts.
   The Rev. Mark Corts, noting that Parks' charge came shortly
before the denomination's June 12-14 convention, said it fuels the
controversy ``rather than rising above it.''
   The 15 million-member denomination has been embroiled for a
decade in a conflict between fundamentalists and moderates over the
Bible.
   It ``may be unfair for the controversy to be the scapegoat for
our failure,'' Corts said in a letter to state Baptist weeklies,
adding:
   ``Are not ... controversy and decline in missions support
symptoms of our desperate need for revival and reformation? The
controversy may reveal our denominational weaknesses rather than
create them.''

<HEAD>Optimist Peale Still Has Winsome Pulpit Flair at 92</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The popular old orator, raconteur, author,
preacher and irrepressible optimist, the Rev. Norman Vincent Peale,
was back in the pulpit on turning 92. Age hasn't dimmed his sparkle.
   He had the packed sanctuary of his longtime pastorate, the
historic Marble Collegiate Church, rolling with intermittant gales
of laughter, applause and concentrated listening.
   ``You believe in yourself,'' he exhorted. ``Believe in God and
believe in Jesus and follow him, and I say toyou, you can do
anything.''
   That was the core of his message, laced with Scripture passages
and illustrative anecdotes, and it has been the nub of his long
career, brimming with confidence and zest for life.
   ``The Power of Postive Thinking,'' he titled his immensely
successful 1952 book, still reprinted and internationally
circulated, followed by 17 others, mostly stressing self-assurance
and faith as keys to accomplishment.
   The theme runs through many of the titles, such as ``The
Tough-minded Optimist,'' ``Enthusiasm Makes the Difference'' and
``You Can if You Think You Can.''
   Besides spreading encouragement in his books, he's done it on the
lecture circuit, in broadcasts, in a syndicated newspaper column,
``Confident Living'' and in a pioneering center he founded linking
psychiatry and religion.
   ``It probably had the most extensive influence in bringing the
two fields together,'' said the Rev. Arthur Caliandro, now Marble
Collegiate's regular pastor. ``The whole area has now opened up much
more.''
   The center, the Institute of Religion and Health, started in
1937, still functions with staff psychiatrists at the church. Peale
and his wife, Ruth, also edit an inspirational monthly, Guideposts,
with 4 million circulation.
   It had been two years since he had preached at Marble Collegiate,
which he led for 52 years until 1984. But he was back at that old
stand once again on Sunday, May 20, prior to his 92nd birthday May
3l.
   Of his first sermon there in 1932, he said, ``I was scared.'' He
paused, grinning. ``And I'm scared today.'' But his voice was about
as strong as ever, his gestures sure, his down-home, Midwestern
charm flashing.
   When first called as pastor of the church, he said it had been
``without a minister for three years.'' Another pause. ``They called
me because I was better than nothing.''
   Laughter at that and other points sprinkled the hour. Caliandro
once described Peale as a ``loving, laughing shepherd'' who ``made
it fun to be in church.''
   Peale, eying his wife in a pew, said that when he met and married
her in 1930, ``She was acknowledged to be the prettiest girl in
Syracuse University and she's prettier now.'' To the applauding
congregation, he added:
   ``She still ...'' He paused. ``How shall I say it? She's still
the most beautiful woman in New York State.'' More applause.
Gallantly, he amended, ``With the exception of all the women
present.'' Laughter.
   ``I got out of that pretty good didn't I?'' he said. More
laughter.
   That's how it went throughout Peale's 45-minute sermon, threaded
with cheer and thoughtfulness, his recollections, homey sentiments,
stories and his masterfully timed phrasing still in sync.
   Easy and folksy as ever, the Ohio-born Peale told a string of
hilarious, sometimes lesson-pointing tales. Among the hymns that
Sunday was Peale's favorite, ``Be Still My Soul.''
   Preaching on Psalm 34 about a man who sought the Lord and was
delivered from all his fears and troubles, Peale said God stands
ready to ``deliver you from all fears. Not some of them, all of
them.''
   Peale seasonsed his sermon with quips and personal tales, one
about a ``personality development rally'' in Columbus, Ohio,
involving a highly successful businessman who had risen from poverty.
   Asked how he had been so ``wonderfully successful,'' the
businessman said he believed in God, in himself and in his job and
had ```immersed myself in the Bible. There is wisdom in there. In
order to succeed I needed wisdom.'''
   Peale added that the Bible is ``full of wisdom. I've lived a long
time and the Bible never once failed me or let me down.''
   He told of a tiny, 4-foot-11 woman who worked for the late New
York Mayor Fiorello La Guardia and who once in an elevator
complained to him she couldn't do much because she was so small.
   Peale quoted La Guardia as telling her, ```Young lady, you listen
to me. I'm going to tell you something and I know what I'm talking
about. You trust God and believe in yourself and you can do
anything.'''
   As he left the elevator, she noticed that the 5-foot-2 La Guardia
was short, too, but ```as he disappeared down the hall, I saw he was
a giant of a man.'''
   ``So are you!'' Peale told his listeners. By trusting God,
following Jesus and believing in yourself, he said, ``You can do
anything!''

<HEAD>Soviets Create Multiple Parties, Not Multiparty System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vladimir Zhironovsky, chairman of the Liberal
Democrats, conducts interviews on a park bench, not in an office.
His party couldn't afford an office even if one were available.
   ``We don't have any money, we don't have any press, we don't have
any advertising,'' he said on the bench in a quiet, shady corner of
Sokolniki Park in northeast Moscow.
   Nikolai Travkin, a plain-spoken former Communist Party member who
is forming a populist movement, incites disgruntled citizens to
throw out his former comrades. The Russian Social Democrats are
looking for coalition partners, and Communists need not apply.
   Dozens of parties have formed since the Communists and the
national legislature agreed in February to end the party's monopoly
on power. The political spectrum ranges from monarchist to
anarchist, but the Communist Party remains dominant.
   Communist reformer Vyacheslav N. Shostakovsky said the newcomers
present a sideshow of ``proto-parties'' while a struggle for control
goes on in the 19-million member organization that has ruled the
Soviet Union since 1917.
   Travkin agrees what counts is not the number of parties, but
their ability to mount a nationwide challenge to the Communists.
   ``You can create as many parties as you want, but the Communist
Party will strangle them like chickens,'' he told supporters at a
rally.
   In pressing for an end to the constitutional monopoly of power,
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said the Communists would ``struggle
for the status of the ruling party'' rather than having it
guaranteed.
   Whatever the theory, the party still controls newspapers, radio
and television.
   It has lost none of the vast staff and organizational experience
built up over 70 years, and party cells in factories, ministries,
the military and KGB secret police have not been eliminated.
   Opponents of the Communists have none of those advantages, but
also lack the party's big disadvantage: a legacy of repression and
mismanagement that is an easy target to attack.
   Oleg Rumyantsev said his Social Democrats ``are morally and
politically opposed to the ideology and practical ways of
revolutionary communism epitomized by the Bolsheviks.'' The party
will consider a coalition with anyone except the Communists, he told
the Interfax news service.
   Zhironovsky of the Liberal Democrats is a lawyer and proponent of
free markets who has spent years on the edge of the dissident
movement.
   He believes the Soviet Communists are going the way of Eastern
Europe's failed regimes.
   ``The question is how they are going to leave, and when,'' he
said.
   Many prominent people criticize the Communist Party, but forcing
it out will not be easy.
   No big names have joined the small opposition groups. Telephones
and apartments are so scarce there is no place for Zhironovsky to
put the Liberal Democrat headquarters, so he splits it between his
apartment and his office at a publishing house.
   He hopes that, in the interests of political stability, the
Communists will decide to hand over some of their plentiful office
space. Without a regular headquarters, he said, it is impossible for
his 9,000-member group to maintain regular contacts even with
legislators.
   Lawmakers ``have a mass of other problems, and they're going to
spend two or three days looking for me?'' he asked.
   The Communist reformer, Shostakovsky, said small parties do not
yet pose a serious challenge and the main contest is between
reformers and conservatives within the Communist Party.
   ``There are monarchists in the party, as strange as it seems, and
there are anarchists,'' said Shostakovsky, rector of Moscow's Higher
Party School. He is a leader of Democratic Platform, reformers who
want the party leadership to abandon the idea of leading and
organizing the entire society.
   Other members include Boris N. Yeltsin, just elected president of
the Russian Federation; historian Yuri Afanasiev and Gavriil Popov,
mayor of Moscow.
   Some kind of party split is almost certain. A struggle now is
under way for control of the party center, and with it the majority
of members.
   Shostakovsky fears an attempt to seize control by party
hard-liners, who accused Gorbachev's economic advisers in documents
published May 13 of intending to dismantle Soviet socialism. They
condemned ``private enterprise, legalization of accumulating
capital, thirst for profit and individualism.''
   A national party Central Committee document criticized Democratic
Platform this spring for threatening to split the party if it cannot
force reform. The differences probably will come to a head at the
28th party congress beginning July 1, and it is not certain what
direction Gorbachev will take.
   Shostakovsky said he did not expect Gorbachev to propose great
changes. If none occurred, he said, Democratic Platform would leave
and take 500,000 to 600,000 supporters along.
   It would be the largest opposition group by far, but still a
dwarf beside the mother party.
   Despite the prominence of many of its members, Democratic
Platform would face many of the difficulties confronted by other
opposition groups. Most of its supporters are intellectuals and
highly skilled workers, and Shostakovsky acknowledged it had
virtually no support in the countryside.
   Democratic Platform probably would cooperate with Gorbachev as
much as possible, playing the role of a loyal opposition rather than
trying to take power away from him.
   Travkin, whose populist message has found an audience with
radical workers, has been a member of Democratic Platform and still
has a ``partnership'' relationship with it, Shostakovsky said.
   He added, however, that Travkin was pressing too hard. ``There is
a taste of confrontation about it, extremely tough confrontation,''
he said.
   As for Travkin, he said his populist party, which does not yet
have a name, wants to replace local Communist leaders, not engage in
``endless round tables'' to negotiate issues.
   Shostakovsky said opponents may be surprised by the Communists'
staying power.
   They have watched Soviet-inspired parties in Eastern Europe
quickly reduced to demoralized minority parties, he said, but
communism was imposed there and was homegrown in the Soviet Union.

   On most nights, the Nightingale, the
Flying Carpet and the King clamber along the rocky smugglers' trail
in the foothills of Mount Hermon between Lebanon, Syria and Israel.
   Carrying American cigarettes, Scotch whisky and electrical
appliances for Syria on their backs, they run the gantlet of Syrian
and Israeli soldiers dug in along a front that threads across the
snow-capped, 9,200-foot mountain.
   On the return leg, they carry diesel fuel from Iran and other
goods that are prized in lawless Lebanon, where civil war began in
1975 and central authority collapsed long ago.
   The Nightingale, the Flying Carpet and the King are mules
specially trained for the six-hour trek on and around Mount Hermon,
where the borders of Lebanon, Syria and Israel intersect.
   Because of their special skills, each mule is worth about $3,000,
twice the average for a pack animal in southeast Lebanon. Those
skills include recognizing and running from anyone in military
uniform and leading pack trains of up to 100 mules.
   ``It's a no-man's land out there,'' said Adnan Daher, a
16-year-old smuggler. ``The Israelis are on a hill to the west, the
Syrians on a hill to the east and Lebanon behind us.''
   No accurate figures on the smuggling trade are available, but
diplomats in Syria say it amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars
a year.
   Shebaa, a predominantly Sunni Moslem town in the Israeli-occupied
sector of south Lebanon, has been a smugglers' haven for decades.
The men of Shebaa have traditionally defied authority.
   About 5,000 of Shebaa's original population of 200,000 still live
there, said Mohammed Zoheiri, a sprightly man of 90 who has been
mukhtar, or mayor, for 45 years.
   The others went to Beirut, other parts of Lebanon or the oil-rich
Persian Gulf states because ``work opportunities are scarce here,''
Zoheiri said whlle sipping tea with visitors.
   He said the ``mulers'' as he calls them, ``have known no other
way of making a living. They were born on muleback.''
   Some of his 40 grandsons are mulers, as his own father was,
Zoheiri said, and added: ``It's Shebaa's profession.''
   Over the border in Syria is Sirghaya, the nerve center of Syrian
smugglers, where half the 15,000 people live off the contraband
business.
   ``They'd have to arrest the whole town if they wanted to stop
us,'' said a merchant in nearby Madaya, the main outlet for the
smuggled goods. He was unwrapping high-heeled Italian shoes that had
just crossed the frontier.
   Although it costs money in lost tax revenue, diplomats say, the
illegal trade also helps the troubled Syrian economy.
   A recent report by the U.S. Embassy in Damascus said: ``The
off-the-books economy is both a sore point and a salvation. The
black market provides badly needed goods and in many ways keeps the
economy going.''
   Because of the steady flow of contraband, the planners of Syria's
socialist economy do not have to divert precious foreign exchange
for imports. President Hafez Assad's government generally turns a
blind eye as long as the trade keeps to border towns.
   Diplomats in Damascus said there even was a sizable illicit trade
in goods from Israel through the Israeli-occupied zone in south
Lebanon.
   Iron reinforcing bars and other building materials are
particularly prized in Syria. The U.S. Embassy report said Syrian
construction workers ``would be out of jobs but for smuggled
building materials.''
   Daher, the 16-year-old smuggler from Shebaa, said after a recent
nocturnal expedition: ``We provide whatever our Syrian partners
demand.''
   He said the Shebaa men hand over their loads to Syrian mule
trains.
   Each mule carries about 100 kilograms, or 220 pounds. Each
smuggler owns two mules and clears about $100 a week, four times the
average wage in Lebanon.
   ``Syrian soldiers usually start intercepting us after the snow
melts,'' said a smuggler who identified himself only as Ahmed. ``We
move to another unloading spot close to the Israeli-controlled hill.
The Syrians don't go there.''
   A few days earlier, a Syrian customs patrol fired on a pack train
from Shebaa and killed a mule, but the smugglers escaped with the
rest of their animals.
   Shebaa smugglers have 600 to 800 mules, said Amin, a 51-year-old
who has been in the trade since boyhood.
   ``It's a dangerous profession, but Shebaa's smugglers rarely get
killed,'' he said. ``We know our way and the lead mules are well
trained.''
   Most Shebaa men killed in recent years were victims of land
mines, he said.
   Amin said it takes up to three months to train a lead mule, which
should be ``big, strong, healthy and smart.''
   A mule chosen as a leader is kept in an ``isolated, dark stable
without food or water for two days,'' he said.
   ``Then a man, who shouldn't be a smuggler because the mule would
get used to his smell, goes in dressed as a soldier and beats the
mule with a stick,'' Amin said. ``A smuggler goes in after him and
gives the mule food and water.'' He said the ``soldier'' fires a
rifle near the mule during the beating. ``The `soldier' becomes the
mule's enemy,'' he explained, ``and the animal tries to escape the
minute a soldier is seen or a bullet is fired. At this point, the
mule becomes eligible to lead a caravan.''

<HEAD>Trying To Grab The IRA: Extradition Disputes Worsen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dermot Finucane, Northern Ireland
jailbreaker and IRA gunman wanted by Britain, is enjoying a fine
Dublin summer, savoring freedom and drawing welfare checks.
   ``It's a great victory,'' said Finucane, 29, who has spent most
of his adult life in jail or on the run. ``For someone suddenly to
say you're free ... it's also frightening and bewildering and
wonderful at the same time.''
   To the British government, his freedom is infuriating and the
reasons are disturbing.
   In March, the Irish Supreme Court refused to extradite Finucane
to British-ruled Northern Ireland. It said his offense of possessing
weapons was politically inspired, since the Irish Republican Army is
fighting to unite Ireland.
   The five judges added that Finucane probably would be beaten by
prison guards if returned to the jail from which he escaped in 1983.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain called the ruling
``deeply offensive'' and said it encouraged ``terrorists to the view
that they will probably find a safe haven in the Republic of
Ireland.''
   Disputes over extradition have long clouded relations between the
two countries, but things reached a new low after Finucane and an
IRA comrade, James Clark, walked free March 13 into the arms of
jubilant supporters. Both were convicted in Northern Ireland and
sentenced to 18-year prison terms.
   Prime Minister Charles Haughey's Fianna Fail party, political
heirs of the Irish nationalist heroes who wrested independence from
Britain in the 1920s, is instinctively opposed to handing Irish
people over to the British.
   The IRA is dedicated to overthrowing the institutions governing
the Irish Republic, as well as British rule in Northern Ireland.
Ireland, like Britain, outlaws the organization and keeps its
supporters off radio and television.
   Extradition remains a problem, however, because of the deeply
rooted belief that an Irish nationalist will not get fair treatment
from the British.
   In the past year, British appeal judges have quashed the
convictions of four Irish people jailed for IRA bombings in Britain
in 1974 and three who were accused of plotting to assassinate a
British government minister.
   Six Irishmen serving life sentences for a 1974 bombing in
Birmingham that killed 21 people have won widespread support for
their campaign to prove they were unjustly convicted.
   It all ``reinforces widespread unease about the conduct of court
cases in Britain in which Irish people are charged with terrorist
offenses,'' said columnist Mary Holland of the Irish Times, which
opposes the IRA.
   Among those who got away is a Roman Catholic priest, Patrick
Ryan. The Irish attorney general refused his extradition on
terrorism charges in 1988, declaring British politicians and
newspapers had damned Ryan in such intemperate language that a fair
trial was impossible.
   Britain and other Irish political parties are putting pressure on
Haughey to amend the extradition laws. Critics want it spelled out
that such crimes as murder or possessing weapons cannot be deemed
political.
   ``The idea that such barbarism should somehow be construed as a
form of political action is nauseating and immoral and cannot
continue,'' said Desmond O'Malley, leader of the Progressive
Democrats, the Fianna Fail's junior coalition partner.
   Recent bombings in London have increased the pressure on Haughey.
   The British say the attacks herald a summer onslaught in mainland
Britain as part of the IRA campaign to unite Protestant-dominated
Northern Ireland with the overwhelmingly Catholic republic.
   Haughey says a 1987 act curtailing the plea of political
motivation will ``do away with the present difficulties.'' He tells
critics to wait and see how the courts apply the 1987 statute, which
incorporates the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.
   ``Our extradition laws are amongst the best in the world,'' he
told Fianna Fail's annual convention soon after Finucane was
released.
   Also, however, delegates endorsed a resolution opposing any
extraditions ``to Northern Ireland and Britain in present
circumstances.'' It said suspects should be tried instead under the
republic's anti-terrorist laws.
   Although Finucane's case predates the 1987 act, some critics say
his release has undermined it and is good news for five Northern
Ireland fugitives fighting extradition under the stricter law.
   Cases still take a year or more to grind through appeals, and
scope remains in the 1987 act for fighting extradition on political
grounds.
   Since 1972, Britain has made 112 applications for extradition of
security offenders, Northern Ireland officials say, with seven
granted, 41 refused, and five still being fought. The rest lapsed.
   To Northern Ireland's unionists, the Protestant majority, Ireland
looks like a haven for their terrorist foes. The British feel let
down, because improved extradition procedures were supposed to be
the reward for giving Ireland a say in the running of Northern
Ireland under the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement.
   Ireland's Progressive Democrats began a campaign May 14 to
toughen the extradition law, and found the opposition Fine Gael and
Labor parties generally supportive.
   ``It is a huge scandal that that man (Finucane) goes free,''
party president Michael McDowell, a lawyer, said in an interview in
the library of his home.
   ``I know how I would feel if I were a unionist in Northern
Ireland watching someone like Finucane, a convicted terrorist,
kicking his heels safe and free.''
   At the downtown headquarters of Sinn Fein, the IRA's legal
political front, Finucane retorted: ``How does a nationalist feel
when a British soldier walks free after murdering one of us?''
   Finucane is one of eight children of a working class family in
Belfast, and says his early memories are of his home being burned
down by Protestants.
   Growing up in a Catholic ghetto, he learned to hate the British
and the local, mainly Protestant, security forces.
   ``As kids we played the IRA and British troops,'' Finucane said.
``You learned that if we didn't protect ourselves, no one would.''
   At 17, he was arrested and, he says, beaten by British army
interrogators. Soon afterward, he crossed the line from hurling
gasoline bombs in street riots to carrying an IRA gun.
   He married in 1980 and has a 9-year-old daughter with whom he
never has spent more than two weeks at a time.
   In 1981, police captured Finucane and two other IRA men in a car
chase after an attack on an army patrol in Belfast's Anderstontown
district. Their weapons were in the car.
   Finucane was sentenced to 18 years in prison.
   He joined a mass breakout from Northern Ireland's Maze prison in
1983 and fled south to the republic. Irish security forces picked
him up during a series of raids on suspected safe houses in 1987.
   His brother Patrick, a lawyer who defended IRA suspects, was shot
to death and Protestant militants claimed responsibility. Another
brother, Gerard, is in an Irish jail for IRA activity and John
Finucane was killed in an auto accident en route to an IRA operation.

<NOTE>Eds: Film opens nationwide on June 8</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Just after the titles for ``Another 48 HRS,'' two highway patrol
officers and the bartender of a remote desert tavern are blasted
point-blank by a trio of Neanderthal bikers. That pretty much sets
the tone for the second of the heavy-artillery movies this violent
movie summer.
   The first was ``Total Recall,'' with Arnold Schwarzenegger as the
main marksman. Coming soon are ``Dick Tracy,'' ``Robocop 2'' and
``Die Hard 2.''
   Few sequels have followed the pattern of the original as closely
as ``Another 48 HRS.'' Once again, Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy) is
in prison _ framed, according to him. Jack Cates (Nick Nolte), the
loose gun of the San Francisco police department, is once more in
trouble with his bosses as he continues his pursuit of ``The
Iceberg,'' mastermind of a dope ring. Reggie is released and,
kicking and screaming, becomes Cates' accomplice.
   Several gimmicks are repeated from ``48 HRS.'': Reggie's singing
to James Brown tapes on his Walkman; a donnybrook in a Western bar.
But then, the filmmakers must have concluded, why tamper with
success?
   Within the first 15 minutes, the bikers shoot Jack Cates in the
chest and then try to assassinate Reggie while he's riding in a bus.
The pace never slackens thereafter.
   Walter Hill, who repeats as director, is one of the best
practitioners of non-stop action, and he fills the screen with
compelling images. He favors closeups of shoes walking toward a
shootout, neon shimmering on wet streets, bodies crashing through
picture windows. One bad guy falls from a building and lands on a
truckload of five-gallon water bottles.
   When bodies aren't being blasted, Reggie and Cates engage in
shouting matches. Their repartee fortunately is brightly written (by
John Fasano, Jeb Stuart and Larry Gross) and delivered with total
relish by Murphy and Nolte. Of all the bickering partners in
fighting crime, they are the best.
   ``Another 48 HRS.'' doesn't pause for romantic interest. No time
for that. If the final unmasking of The Iceman isn't much of a
surprise, that's OK. The movie is meant to be existential.
   After a few films unworthy of his talent, Eddie Murphy returns to
form with what he plays best: the fast-talking survivor in a hostile
world. Nick Nolte also shines in a role tailored to his shambling
frame. The supporting cast, which includes Bernie Casey as Murphy's
convict friend and Tisha Campbell as his daughter, is highly
effective.
   Lawrence D. Wachs and Lawrence Gordon produced the Paramount
Pictures release, which is rated R for language and excessive
violence. Running time: 95 minutes.

   In 1984, Ellen Altmann's boss at LaGuardia
Hospital told her she was spending too much time assisting a man who
had AIDS. The physicians were angry with her and worried she was
going to catch the disease by being in the same room with him so
often.
   So she did the only thing she felt she could do.
   ``When I handed in my resignation,'' Ellen said, ``I told them,
`I've decided to work exclusively with patients with AIDS.'''
   Her supervisor was astounded. ``What, are you crazy? Aren't you
afraid? You want to have a family someday. You're going to catch
something!''
   ``I'm not afraid,'' Ellen said. ``I'm just not ignorant.''
   Since the time before AIDS had a name, Ellen and Ed Altmann have
built their professional _ and sometimes, personal _ lives around
caring for people with the fatal, incurable disease. They are both
nurses, colleagues for seven years, spouses for five, taking on the
job it seemed at times no one else wanted.
   ``AIDS is especially nursing's disease,'' said Ellen, 32, now the
head nurse for the newly opened AIDS unit at Lenox Hill Hospital on
Manhattan's Upper East Side. ``I could work in a doctor's office, I
could work in a lab, I could work in surgery, I could work in
maternal-child health, where a lot of things are mostly happy.
   ``But I think this is really the essence of nursing.''
   If AIDS is nursing's disease, as the Altmanns believe, it is
because medical technology has made so little headway against it.
Nursing care can make a difference, can help keep a person with the
full-blown disease out of the hospital.
   But few drugs have any impact on the inexorable ravages of the
virus.
   ``I think this is a particularly insane profession, very
strenuous, where you're always facing insurmountable odds,'' said
Ed, 36, who works in the nursing end of AIDS research running drug
trials for the Community Research Initiative.
   ``Working in a field like this, keeping that separation between
personal and professional, keeping some control over your life, it
really is a skill. A lot of people do burn out ... but to stay in
it, you really have to develop those boundaries for yourself.''
   There have been many times in their lives when the boundaries
between their personal and professional lives have disappeared, lost
in their passion for their cause.
   After Ellen resigned, she and Ed went to St. Clare's, a small,
aging Roman Catholic hospital tucked into Manhattan's tough Hell's
Kitchen neighborhood.
   There, in the city's first dedicated AIDS unit, they worked
14-hour days creating what would become a model for other hospitals.
   The two of them were the entire nursing staff, a pair with
distinctly different yet complementary styles. She's intense,
matter-of-fact, a doer who exudes confidence and competence; he's
more easy-going, a low-key observer who seems quietly self-assured.
   They also were newlyweds, spending 24 hours a day together,
supporting each other, fighting the tough fight and loving it.
   ``We spent more time together working than we ever have,'' Ellen
said. ``We were fighting for a cause together, something we were
both committed to.''
   ``It was a tremendous task and a thankless job,'' Ed said. ``But
by doing it, by putting ourselves in that situation, we got the
opportunity to learn how the system really works, how to start a new
program and make it fit into a hospital that's very resistant to
change.''
   At first, the doctors wouldn't come to their floor, the
housekeepers wouldn't come, the X-ray technicians wouldn't come. The
kitchen served patients' meals on paper trays. The fear was palpable.
   Gradually, that changed. As the years passed, staffers who had
resented mandatory AIDS education classes that Ellen taught began
asking for them. What never changed was the relative youth of the
patients, many of them vital people at the height of their careers,
and the inevitability of their deterioration. ``We both ended up
getting involved with special patients who, for one reason or
another, became very close to us,'' Ellen said. ``We were able to
support each other through their deaths.''
   As patients have become their friends over the years, so some of
their friends have become patients.
   For months, the Altmanns took turns nursing a friend who required
daily care. They were the only ones he would allow administer his
twice-daily intravenous medication.
   Either Ed or Ellen would visit him in the morning before work,
and the other would come in the evening. They kept their home
stocked with IV supplies in case he was visiting their Queens
neighborhood.
   ``We never made any plans that didn't include seeing him or
communicating with him in some way,'' Ellen said. ``We restricted
our lives based on how he was feeling, because we always wanted to
be available.
   ``It was really stressful, and there were times we were angry. We
shouldn't have gotten so involved _ but how could we not?'' she
said, adding that their care helped the friend avoid two or three
hospitalizations. He died in January.
   ``I don't regret any of it,'' Ellen said. ``Even though at times
it seemed overwhelming for him to be so dependent on us, and us to
have all our social plans revolved around his care, I would not have
done it any differently.''
   Still, the days are gone when they would unhesitatingly dedicate
every spare minute to AIDS care with little thought to their
personal lives. Now, Ed spends two days a week at home with their
20-month-old son, Joshua, and Ellen makes it a point to work regular
hours and spend evenings and weekends with her family.
   But the nature of their work _ the intensity of the demands, the
inevitability of death _ means they always will need to look to each
other for special support.
   ``When you're talking to a friend who is not a nurse, and they
ask, `What do you do?' I can't possibly answer that,'' Ellen said.
``I can talk to you for weeks and weeks and weeks, and you still
wouldn't understand all the things I do as a nurse. And Ed
understands.''
   ``Sometimes,'' Ed said, ``just a couple of words, and I know
exactly what she's going through.''

   At the age of only 10, Tony heard the words that
pierced his heart and changed his world forever. He wasn't wanted
anymore _ his adoptive parents were giving him back.
   The couple, who had raised Tony for nearly half his life, said he
didn't ``bond'' with them and was a disturbed child who abused and
endangered his 8-year-old brother, Sam.
   Their decision: keep one boy, return the other.
   ``I was crying and I was very sad,'' Tony said in a tape
recording made for the couple after he moved out. ``I was adopted
before and I don't like being pushed around by people.''
   While most adoptions in America succeed, Tony's case is among the
small number that don't have a storybook ending, just the pain and
strain of a child and adults who share little but feelings of
frustration and failure.
   ``Normally, it's a very traumatic experience,'' said Joe Kroll,
director of the North American Council on Adoptable Children. ``It
definitely tears at both sides. You're losing a child. A child is
losing the parent.''
   Tony _ whose legal fight to visit his biological brother captured
national attention _ has turned the spotlight on failed adoptions,
stirring debate over the responsibility of prospective parents and
the rights of children when forging family ties.
   ``It creates new legal questions ... on some of the most
difficult kinds of cases in the law because they really do hit you
where you live,'' said Dan Polsby, a Northwestern University law
professor.
   ``Family law issues are characteristically gut-wrenchers,'' he
said.
   Some argue adoption is an ironclad, for-better-or-worse
commitment.
   ``This is not something you go into thinking `If it doesn't work,
we can always undo it,' '' said Hal Gaither, a Texas family court
judge who has handled failed adoptions. ``A child should not be
treated like commodities that can be changed.''
   ``We're talking about a human being. We're not talking about an
automobile that you're tired of,'' said Pat Murphy, the Cook County
public guardian who represented Tony in a court fight settled in
late May when the adoptive parents agreed to sibling visits. ``How
many abandonments can you take in life before it really starts to
kill you?''
   But others contend biological parents sever ties with children,
so adoptive families should have the same option.
   ``There are lots of natural families who decide ... they're going
to terminate their parental rights,'' said Mary Martin, the attorney
who represented Tony's adoptive parents.
   Many legal experts say that rarely happens with older children,
however, because the state and agencies are reluctant to accept
them, knowing they aren't good adoption prospects.
   Lawyers also say parents generally don't reject adoptive children
unless conditions are unbearable, ripping apart families and
marriages.
   Still, there are exceptions. Murphy cited one couple who divorced
and fought over the property, but returned the child, and another in
which the father, who was close to his adoptive son, died and his
wife returned the boy.
   Tony's adoptive parents, known only as Joseph and Pamela Doe, a
butcher and hairdresser from suburban Bellwood, said they couldn't
cope any longer with the boy's emotional problems and abuse of Sam.
They claimed Tony struck Sam, cut him and tried to drown him.
   ``He certainly was doing things that were putting incredible
pressure on them trying to live together as family,'' Ms. Martin
said.
   But Murphy calls Tony ``extremely likable, engaging'' and notes
psychologists say the parents were too rigid.
   Both boys were adopted in 1984 after being rejected twice by
their natural mother, who kept their sister.
   As for Tony, he was shocked when his adoptive parents announced
he'd be returned to the state. ``I thought they were kidding. They
weren't,'' he said on the tape made with friends last winter.
   The couple refused to listen to his plaintive message, according
to Murphy.
   Tony's plight engendered much sympathy. In fact, Ms. Martin said
the adoptive father told her if he'd heard this story years ago, ``I
would have thought, `Isn't that awful?' But you have to live in my
shoes these last six years to know how you come to this point and
how painful it is.''
   Few adoptions end so tragically.
   Of some 50,000 adoptions annually, experts say less than 2
percent fail. But for special-needs children _ those who are older
or handicapped _ the rate is between 11 percent and 13 percent, and
nearly one in four for adolescents and teen-agers.
   ``Marriages have a 50 percent failure rate,'' said Bill Pierce,
president of the National Committee for Adoption. ``In adoptions,
the fact we have a 13 percent failure rate is an astounding
success.''
   Some say, however, that rate may climb because healthy white
babies are scarce, while the adoption pool largely consists of older
children with histories of neglect or abuse, or infants born of
addicted mothers.
   ``The reason you might have more children who don't work out is
we're trying with tougher and tougher kids,'' said adoption advocate
Kroll. ``Today, every kind of kid has been adopted _ kids without
arms or legs, sexually abused, those in foster homes. Twenty years
ago, they were written off.''
   A home, though, isn't an instant formula for success.
   Experts say adoptions fail for several reasons: age, handicaps
parents can't handle, lack of personal history, and unrealistic
expectations _ with some children harboring fantasies about
idealized family life and some adults becoming disappointed when the
children aren't grateful or relieved to have a new home.
   A study of 927 children 3 years and older adopted from 1980-84 in
California found age was the strongest predictor of disruption and
that the less information families had, the likelier the problems,
said Richard Barth, one of the authors and an associate professor at
the University of California-Berkeley's social welfare school.
   Lack of access to personal files prompted a Texas lawsuit by
several families who claimed they weren't told of their adoptive
children's histories of sexual abuse or physical problems.
   Thus far, the federal courts have ruled against the parents, who
wanted the files to help their children's treatment.
   In a different adoption trauma in Texas, a couple gave up their
adopted baby daughter after discovering she was severely mentally
retarded and deciding they couldn't cope with that.
   Judge Gaither, who terminated their visitation rights but refused
to end all parental obligations, is not sympathetic.
   ``A birth parent has to take what they're given,'' he said. ``A
lot of birth parents are saddled with problems that will never be
solved.''
   Tony now lives in a foster home.
   In his taped message, he was reassuring. ``You don't have to
worry about me because I'm doing fine and I miss you a lot,'' he
said. He signed off as ``your loving friend _ and part-time son.''
   One of Tony's buddies offered an epilogue, saying when he heard
what happened, ``I started to cry. I said, `Well buddy, I'm sorry
you have to do this, but this is life.' ''

   The great majority of adoptions in America, even those involving
older or disabled children, succeed. But a small number of cases
fail. Sometimes the parents can't cope. Other times, the child
doesn't fit in.
   Here are four stories of adoptions that didn't work out:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>STACEY:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   When Rhonda and Dan Stanton adopted little Stacey, they thought
the next 20 years of their lives would be devoted to nurturing,
raising and loving their daughter.
   After years of being unable to conceive, the Texas couple finally
had a child _ a soft, sweet-smelling newborn girl. No genie could
have granted them a greater wish.
   That promise soon turned to pain. As Stacey grew, the couple
learned she was severely mentally retarded. They anguished, they
cried, then they gave her up, because, Mrs. Stanton said, ``I just
didn't have what it takes to cope with that.''
   The Stantons became aware of Stacey's problems months after
adopting her from a private agency in 1986. The child looked alert,
but something didn't seem quite right. She began having eye
problems. She didn't cry.
   The couple took her to the best doctors and therapists. Then,
Mrs. Stanton recalled, came a brutal assessment from a neurologist:
``He said, `Her brain stopped growing at nine months. Go home and
grieve. Men do it different from women. Try not to fight with each
other.' ''
   Afterwards, Mrs. Stanton placed a sleeping Stacey in the car,
thinking ``my beautiful little baby had died.''
   The Stantons were torn, wondering how they could keep Stacey, but
how they could give her up. ``For six months, we died every single
minute of every single day,'' she said. ``We laid on the floor and
cried.''
   They gave her up, Mrs. Stanton said, objecting to any suggestion
they returned her. ``She's not shoes or groceries.''
   In 1989, a judge ended the Stantons' visitation rights and
suspended their financial obligations but refused to terminate
parental rights. That will happen if Stacey, now 3{ and in a foster
home, is adopted.
   The Stantons say some folks have branded them cowards. ``We feel
terribly, terribly guilty,'' she said. ``Nobody knows how this just
kills us.
   ``She was the greatest joy and the most special love of our life.
There was no love like that love. It's like a giant hole in my
heart. A real shattered heart. Time won't ever completely mend this.
... We still miss her incredibly.''

   One of ArLynn Leiber Presser's early childhood memories is the
day she said goodbye to her mother and embarked on a new life in a
new house with new parents.
   ``It's one thing to be put up for adoption when you're a day
old,'' she said. ``At 3 years old, you think, `My God, what did I
do? What kind of horrible child was I?'''
   Ms. Presser's childhood years were turbulent, with some joyful
moments, mostly in school, and many more unhappy ones _ at home. She
says she never made many friends, never went to the movies, never
felt like she belonged.
   When her adoptive parents gave parties, she says she often was
asked to make a little speech: ``I'm specially adopted. Of all the
people my parents could have chosen, they chose me. I'm very lucky.
...''
   ``In some ways,'' she now says, ``all of us recognized I really
wasn't their child.''
   Ms. Presser says she was harshly punished, ran away several times
as an adolescent, was kicked out, and was committed to a psychiatric
unit. Finally, when she was about 15 years old, she legally severed
ties with her adoptive parents.
   ``I really thought they were horrible people,'' the Chicago
lawyer and free-lance writer said. ``I still feel that. I feel like
they bit off more than they could chew.''
   As an adult, Ms. Presser, 29, tracked down her biological
parents, who divorced shortly after giving her up for adoption.
   She's now happily married with two stepchildren and a 2-year-old
son, but there are scars.
   ``I felt enormously like I had done something terribly wrong,''
she said. ``This is a feeling I still have years later. Everybody
else sitting in this world has parents who just adore them and fight
like mother tigers when anything threatens them. I failed at being a
kid.
   ``I look at the adoration I have for my son now,'' she said. ``I
don't think that anybody looked at me with so much love as I look at
my son with. When he watches `Sesame Street,' I watch it. When he
walks in a puddle, I walk in it. I feel like I live my childhood
through him.''

<HEAD>`ALICE':</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Susan Tom still keeps a heart-shaped box she received many years
ago as a Mother's Day gift. It's a bittersweet reminder of one of
the saddest experiences in her life.
   The box was given to her by a little girl she'd hoped would be
her daughter, a dream that never came true. The Toms decided not to
make permanent the adoption and the 9-year-old left the Toms' home
in Fairfield, Calif., after almost a year with them.
   ``It was the worst day,'' Ms. Tom said of their separation. ``I
had to tell her and I took her back the next day. Although she cried
and I cried ... she never said, `I'll change.' ... She had given
up.''
   ``I went into a very bad depression,'' she recalled.
   The girl moved into the Toms' home in 1982 after four years in
foster care and five more with a family who didn't want to finalize
the adoption.
   ``She came directly from their home into my home,'' said Ms. Tom,
now divorced. ``There was no in-between. We had a child who needed
to grieve for the loss. That's exactly what it is. It's like a very
bad divorce.
   ``The tension built. The stress built,'' Ms. Tom said, noting the
family moved to Fairfield with Alice, her name for the girl. ``She
stopped doing some of her schoolwork. She was so unhappy. I didn't
know what to do.
   ``Now I would probably ride it out,'' said Ms. Tom, a 42-year-old
single mother of six. ``I was fairly naive at the time and did not
have the support system that I now have. I have learned there are
probably things I should have done. There are people I could have
called.''
   Ms. Tom has four adopted children with special needs and, with an
organization called Aid to Adoption of Special Kids, runs a group
for single women who want to take similar steps.
   Several years after Alice left, Ms. Tom met her and they
reminisced. ``I care very much about her,'' she said. ``I think if
she never needs me, she can call at any time.''

<HEAD>UNDATED: any time.''
   ^`ROBERT':</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bonnie Hudson, mother of 13, is an optimist who doesn't like to
give up on any child. But when it came to her adopted son, Robert,
it was give up _ or destroy her family.
   The Hudsons already had adopted four special needs children when
they welcomed a boy from India. He had serious physical handicaps
they didn't know about. His tormented past was a surprise, too.
   Robert, they learned, was in jail in India before the orphanage.
He was a clever pickpocket and had been sexually abused at
knifepoint as a child.
   So when Robert began stealing and lying months after his arrival,
Mrs. Hudson, who was adopted as a child, told him: ``We want you to
know it's never too late for any human being to change as long as
there is life and breath.''
   Eighteen months later came a shocking discovery. Robert, who was
probably 12 years old, not 9 as they'd been told, had been sexually
abusing three of their daughters _ two of them infants, one a
mentally slow first-grader.
   ``I wanted to kill him. It's beyond anger. It's rage,'' said Mrs.
Hudson, who asked that her and her adopted son's real names not be
used. ``There was no history to let us know this little guy could
not be trusted in a household with a younger child.''
   The Hudsons tried therapy, switching schools, having him watched
constantly, even locking him up in a psychiatric ward, where, Mrs.
Hudson said, he sexually abused boys. ``He couldn't promise to
reform and he couldn't promise to control himself,'' she added.
   Back home, the fears mounted. Mrs. Hudson worried Robert would
set fire to their house.
   ``This is the kind of kid who couldn't accept love in a family
life. It's like catching a wild lion and saying, `You don't have to
hunt and kill for your food.'''
   After six years, ``It snapped in my head _ for the sake of
rehabilitating one, you may lose the whole family,'' she said.
   In 1987, Robert insisted they legally end the adoption. ``He told
me, `I would rather be on the streets in India begging than living
with this family,''' she said. ``Even the judge said, `This isn't
going to work.' I kept saying, `I've never given up on a human being
in my life.'''
   ``I cried for three months. I never failed with a kid,'' said
Mrs. Hudson, who lives in the Midwest.
   ``No one pats you on the back and says, `Thank you,''' she said.
``They mark you off as a failed adoption.''
   Mrs. Hudson said Robert lives in a supervised foster home and
calls occasionally. But she doesn't want him in her house.
   ``I still pray for him all the time,'' she said. ``He still calls
me `mom' and I still think I am.''

<HEAD>Olivia d'Abo Enters the 1970s on ABC's `The Wonder Years'</HEAD>

   On ABC's ``The Wonder Years,'' the character
played by Olivia d'Abo has turned 18 and graduated from high school
and is uncertain of her future as the hit show enters the 1970s.
   In the final episodes of the sitcom's third season, Karen Arnold
had several traumatic experiences that set the stage for the fall.
   ``I don't know what's going to happen to Karen next season,''
d'Abo said. ``Her parents want her to go to college. She wants to go
to Europe. She's confused and doesn't know what she wants. But if
she does go to college, she wants to get away from her parents.''
   Fred Savage stars in ``The Wonder Years'' as Karen's younger
brother, Kevin, who recently entered his teens and faces his own
uncertain future. His girlfriend has moved out of the neighborhood.
   The older brother, Wayne, played by Jason Hervey, gets his first
job.
   ``It's really about kids slowly moving into the 1970s,'' d'Abo
said. ``It gives us room for imagination for next season.''
   The show also stars Alley Mills and Dan Lauria as the parents,
Danica McKellar as Kevin's girlfriend, Winnie, and Josh Saviano as
his best friend, Paul.
   Unlike Karen, d'Abo has a cosmopolitan background. She was born
in London 21 years ago to rock singer Michael d'Abo of Manfred Mann
and actress-model Maggie London d'Abo. She grew up in London, Taos,
N.M., and Los Angeles, where she now shares a house with her cousin,
Maryam d'Abo, also an actress.
   ``I've always known exactly what I wanted,'' d'Abo said. ``All my
life I've been around adults, and coming from Europe, I suppose I
had a different background and different values. My parents were
very supportive.''
   Away from the show, she slips back into a British accent and
dates singer Julian Lennon, son of the late Beatle John Lennon.
   D'Abo said she's only started to learn who her character on ``The
Wonder Years'' is as the show enters its fourth season.
   ``I think she started off being one thing, but when new producers
took over the show, they saw her differently,'' she said. ``She
began as a 16-year-old who said a lot of rebellious things she
didn't really understand. She's matured, and in the final episodes
of the season we see that she and her father are very much alike.
   ``She thinks he's not hip and doesn't understand her. She doesn't
want to be like her mother. She has a boyfriend who goes to Canada
to escape the draft. She and her father have a big fight, but on her
birthday he gives her his old duffel bag from the Korean War and
says, `If you're leaving, you'll need something to put your clothes
in.' ''
   D'Abo has appeared in guest roles in such series as ``Simon and
Simon,'' ``The Bronx Zoo'' and ``Tour of Duty.'' Two roles on
``Growing Pains'' brought her to the attention of Neal Marlens and
Carol Black, who created ``The Wonder Years.''
   Her first experience in front of an audience was at London's
Albert Hall in ``Me and My Teddy Bear'' at the age of 5.
   ``I spoke, wrote and read French in school,'' she said. ``I spoke
English, but didn't read it or write it too well. When I was 8, my
parents moved to New Mexico, which confused me even more. Taos has a
rich ethnic mixture, but I caught on quickly because I have a good
ear.
   ``When I was 12, we moved to L.A. I spent so much time working on
movies that I had to go to a private school so they would hold my
place in class. I did my first commercial for McDonald's when I was
13. I celebrated my 15th birthday on the set of my first feature,
`Conan the Destroyer.'''
   Asked about rumors of marriage to Lennon, she responded, ``Who
knows? I'm 21. I think marriage is a wonderful thing, but you have
to think about it.
   ``I do want to have children, but I also want my independence.
I've had my own home since I was 19 and I've worked hard for
everything. I've always put my career first. Julian and I both have
our careers. He's accepted me as I am and not tried to change me, as
I've accepted him.''

<HEAD>Democrats Charging Statehouse Gates in South Carolina</HEAD>

   Democratic hopes of recapturing the
governor's mansion in South Carolina rest with two insurgents
painting their race as a rally of the masses against an entrenched
aristocracy.
   Charging the statehouse doors are Ernest Passailaigue and Theo
Mitchell, state Senate colleagues who meet in Tuesday's primary. The
Democratic victor faces popular Republican Gov. Carroll Campbell in
November.
   Passailaigue and Mitchell are out to recapture for their party an
office that Democrats have held for all but eight years this
century. But they face a formidable challenge in trying to mobilize
voters against Campbell, a first-term governor who enjoys high
public approval ratings.
   The Democrats have been trying to cast Campbell as a career
politician wooing the wealthy but forgetting the poor, elderly and
average working South Carolinian.
   ``I'll be a citizen's politician, not a career politician,''
Passailaigue says, referring to Campbell's six years in the General
Assembly and eight years in the U.S. House before becoming governor.
   Mitchell, who is hoping to become the state's first black
governor, calls Campbell ``the worst governor of South Carolina in
the 20th century.'' He said Campbell ``catered to the wealthy and
privileged at the expense of the working people, the poor people,
the retired and elderly.''
   ``It's the oldest trick in the Democratic bag of tricks to accuse
the Republicans of wooing the wealthy,'' responded Campbell
spokesman Tucker Eskew.
   The governor kicked off his re-election campaign last month
stressing gains in the state's economy, environment and education
system during his first term.
   ``There is better education, there are more jobs and there is a
safer environment than we had three years ago,'' he said.
   His supporters cite the state's rising per capita income, 4
percent unemployment rate and Campbell initiatives against drugs and
infant mortality.
   Campbell's political strength is evident in his strong advantage
in fund-raising. He has raised about $1.5 million in comparison with
Mitchell's $65,000 and Passailaigue's $69,000.
   The governor pulled in more than $500,000 at a single fund-raiser
attended by President Bush in May.
   Both Passailaigue and Mitchell have shied away from attacking
each other, a tactic Passailaigue says is geared toward a Democratic
victory in November.
   ``I think to beat Campbell you have to run the perfect race,'' he
said. ``You don't have any margin for error.
   ``You really need a unified Democratic Party and then you need
those coalitions that the Democratic Party one time had but no
longer enjoys,'' including groups such as environmentalists and the
working class.
   The platforms of both men are designed to rebuild those
coalitions.
   Mitchell, a 51-year-old lawyer, has consistently pushed for
greater support of public transportation and assistance to the poor.
He has served in the General Assembly for 16 years.
   Some state Democrats privately fear a primary victory for
Mitchell could hasten the departure of whites from the party and
undercut other Democrats on the general election ballot. But
Mitchell rejects such talk, saying the vast majority of South
Carolinians are more concerned about a person's leadership ability,
experience and vision than his color.
   Passailaigue, a 42-year-old certified public accountant, was
first elected to the state Senate in 1988. Despite his freshman
status, he has been a frequent challenger of the Senate leadership,
pushing for consideration of pet projects such as tax reform.
   Mitchell stresses his own public experience over that of
Passailaigue, who responds that there are more important things to
consider.
   ``I think somebody's vision and what they want to do is more
important than sitting in the General Assembly or holding some other
elected office,'' Passailaigue said.
   Both Democrats say they want to reform the state tax system,
though they advocate different approaches. On other issues, the
candidates share similar views.
   Both support a woman's right to an abortion, favor a state
lottery to raise money for education and reject the state's status
as a dump for infectious, hazardous and nuclear waste.
   Mitchell has kept a low public profile during much of the
campaign, but recently accused Passailaigue of latching on to his
own campaign themes.
   ``My opponent has not only adopted my issues, but five of my
phrases as well,'' he said. Mitchell accused Passailaigue of picking
up phrases of his such as ``clean, non-polluting industries'' and
``the regressive tax structure of South Carolina.''
   Passailaigue rejected the copycat charge.

<HEAD>EDITOR'S NOTE: The Supreme Court's nine members are among the most
private of public officials. They wield enormous power but rarely
hold news conferences or give interviews. A recent poll indicated
only one in three Americans can name any of the nine. This, the
ninth and last in a series, offers an up-to-date look at one member
of the nation's highest court.</HEAD>

   Justice Harry A. Blackmun says he is one of the
Supreme Court's ``three old goats'' whose inevitable departure will
solidify conservative domination of the court for the next 40 or 50
years.
   Labeled a conservative when he joined the court two decades ago,
Blackmun now is an outspoken critic of the court's rightward shift.
He demonstrated his candor during an interview with The Associated
Press.
   ``Last year the cluster of five (conservative members) emerged,
and certainly this year they have control of the court completely,
and are making the most of it,'' Blackmun said.
   He listed Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron
R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy
as members of the court's conservative majority.
   ``I had a feeling until last year that, while they could have had
control of the court, they didn't really seize it,'' the 81-year-old
justice said.
   ``I suppose as long as I am not a member of that group it is
difficult. But we shouldn't resent it,'' he said. ``That's the way
the system works. That pendulum swings. It will stay this way now 40
or 50 years, I'm sure.''
   Blackmun, who Saturday marked his 20th anniversary as a justice,
predicts the court will grow more conservative after the departure
of its three octogenarians _ himself and Justices William J.
Brennan, 84, and Thurgood Marshall, 81.
   None of the three has indicated he is considering retirement.
   Brennan and Marshall are the court's most liberal members, often
joined in the most divisive cases by Blackmun and Justice John Paul
Stevens, 70.
   ``Time will take its toll on the three old goats,'' Blackmun
said. ``We will be replaced by appointees of the current
administration or the next one, which is probably going to be
another Bush administration. So it seems to me that before too long
the court could be nine conservatives, and that surely will last
well into the next century.''
   When appointed by President Nixon, Blackmun had the reputation of
a politically and judicially conservative federal appeals court
judge from Minnesota.
   Early in his high court tenure, he was ridiculed for his
perceived dependence on then-Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, an old
friend. Even after Blackmun wrote the court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade
decision legalizing abortion he was considered a dependable
conservative vote.
   By 1980, however, he had emerged as an independent force on the
court. In the past decade, he increasingly sided with the liberal
wing.
   ``I don't believe I've changed in fundamental outlook,'' Blackmun
said. ``If one goes back and reads my opinions on the court of
appeals, you'll find that they are not rock-ribbed conservatism of
the type that seems to be popular today.''
   As a lower court judge, Blackmun said he and his colleagues
``always had the comfort of knowing that if we're wrong, those nine
jokers down in Washington will straighten us out. Here, it's the end
of the line. When one gets here, he has to develop an in-depth
judicial philosophy.''
   He added: ``One has to develop his attitude toward the
(Constitution's) great phrases. What does `equal protection' mean?
What is `cruel and unusual punishment'? I would hope that I have
grown in that respect over the years. But as far as shifting from
conservatism to liberalism, I don't believe I have done that.''
   On the bench, Blackmun most often displays a judicial scowl and
can be snappish with lawyers. Off the bench, warmth and humor
emerge. The justice turns downright effusive when discussing his
three daughters and grandchildren or swapping baseball gossip.
   He is less willing to discuss the possibility of retirement.
   ``I think one has to have good health in this job. I don't
believe one can keep up without it, and I am very conscious of the
fact that some former colleagues of mine who were my age are long
gone,'' Blackmun said.
   After noting that he undergoes a complete physical exam at the
Mayo Clinic each year, Blackmun smiled and said, ``There are two or
three out there who promise they will let me know when my level of
senility reaches the unacceptable point.''
   Blackmun has suffered from recurring cancer of the prostate
gland. Most recently, he was treated for it in 1987. No further
problems have been reported.
   Blackmun realizes his role in court history will be defined
largely by his writing the Roe vs. Wade decision. ``Author of the
abortion decision,'' he once said. ``We all pick up tags. I'll carry
this one to my grave.''
   He has remained an ardent defender of a woman's right to end her
pregnancy and last year dissented bitterly from a decision that gave
states more power to regulate abortion.
   But Blackmun said he hopes other aspects of his tenure will not
be eclipsed. ``I hope I would be remembered as a person of judicial
integrity who wrote acceptably well and contributed in more than one
field,'' he told the AP.
   ``I'd like to be known just as a good worker in the vineyard who
held his own and contributed generally to the advancement of the
law.''

<HEAD>Sales Drop 3.3 Percent in Late May</HEAD>

   Late-May sales of North American-made vehicles
dipped just 3.3 percent from last year's strong pace, but analysts
say real demand is weaker than the figures show.
   The 10 major U.S. car- and truck-making companies Tuesday
reported they sold vehicles at an average of 51,002 a day during May
21-31, compared with a rate of 52,767 during the same time last year.
   A 5.9 percent drop in car sales more than offset a 1.6 percent
rise in sales of trucks, spurred mainly by General Motors Corp.
minivan and Ford Motor Co.'s Explorer sport-utility vehicle sales.
   ``Although the sales pace picked up sharply from mid-May's
disaster level, I would not label overall demand as strong,'' said
analyst Tom Webb with the National Automobile Dealers Association in
McLean, Va.
   The late-May sales drop came against a strong period last year,
when incentives were luring consumers into showrooms. Automakers
lately have been trying to wean car buyers from rebates and
low-interest financing.
   The latest figures would have been worse if not for another surge
in sales of transplants, cars made in the United States at
Japanese-owned factories.
   Late-May sales of cars made in North America by GM, Ford and
Chrysler Corp. fell 10.7 percent while transplant sales rose 23
percent.
   Auto analyst David Healy of Barclays Bank in New York said the
strength of the transplant sales figures was a statistical quirk.
   For instance, U.S. sales arms of Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda
Motor Co. Ltd. reported they sold as many cars in the last 10-day
selling period of the month as they did in the first two periods
combined.
   ``We have another end-of-the-month dramatic recovery in cars
sales that doesn't mean a thing,'' Healy said. ``I think you've got
to look at car sales in the last 30 days and if you do that, it's
going to smooth out that end-of-the-month bulge.''
   For all of May, domestic producers reported a 7.8 percent decline
in car and truck sales. With imported vehicles included, sales ran 7
percent behind the May 1989 level.
   The Big Three's share of the U.S. car market stood at about 61
percent last month, down from 66 percent a year before. The
transplants' share of the market was about 12 percent in May,
compared with 7.3 percent a year ago. Imports made up the balance.
   The industry softness reinforces a report issued Monday by the
Conference Board saying consumer confidence slipped slightly last
month.
   So far for the year, sales of domestic and imported vehicles were
4.3 percent behind last year's pace, with sales of domestic cars and
trucks down 3.9 percent and import sales off 5.6 percent.

   A surge in stocks has taken the glitter off gold,
analysts say.
   Rumors of heavy selling by the Soviet Union and Saudi Arabia also
have contributed to a slump that has pushed gold to its lowest level
in a year. The price could tumble to four-year lows if it doesn't
stabilize soon, analysts say.
   In recent days, gold has traded in the high $350 range, its
lowest level since last June when the low for the month in London
was $358.70.
   ``If it breaks $350, I think there will be more selling to
$335,'' said Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst at PaineWebber
Inc.
   The last time gold prices were that low was in June 1986, when
the monthly low was $336.75, according to the World Gold Council, a
non-profit mining companies association.
   Gold was quoted at $358.10 an ounce at London's afternoon fixing
Tuesday. Gold for current delivery settled at $359.80 later on the
New York Commodity Exchange, up $1.20 from Monday.
   That marks a decline of about 15 percent since February, when
gold hit a near-term high of $423.75. The slide has been especially
painful to investors because, unlike stocks and bonds, gold pays no
dividends or interest.
   Some analysts said the slump stems from the rally in the stock
market, which has attracted investment money. An ebbing of inflation
fears because of recent signs of weak economic growth also has hurt
gold, which traditionally is bought as a hedge against higher
prices, they said.
   Rumors of large selling by the Soviet Union and Middle Eastern
countries also have hurt the market. Twice since March, sharp price
drops have been attributed by market watchers to gold selling by
Saudi Arabia.
   The steep decline has scared many traders who are now afraid to
bet on a rebound, said Mark Kadlec, a vice president at Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc.
   ``Nobody knows how low `low' is. There is a half-decent
possibility the low is around this level,'' said Fred Bogart, a gold
trader and executive vice president at Republic Bank in New York.
``If it drops below $350, all bets are off and anything could
happen.''
   John Lutely, managing director of the Gold Institute in
Washington, said reports that the Soviets have had trouble meeting
debt payments have made many traders fearful that the world's
second-largest gold producer may begin selling more gold to raise
hard currency. The fear, rather than any evidence of actual selling,
may be forcing the market down, he said.
   ``They're smart traders and they know when it's not in their best
interest to sell. And it's not in their interest,'' Bogart said,
dismissing talk of big Soviet gold solds.
   Some traders and analysts said it's more likely that investors
have left the gold market in favor of stocks, judging by the rise in
the Dow Jones industrial average toward the 3,000 level in recent
weeks. The easing of inflation worries also has triggered a big
rally in bond prices in recent weeks.
   ``People have been going to paper rather than hold on to precious
metals,'' Kadlec said.

<HEAD>Administration Unveils Plan for ``One Market'' in Stock Index
Futures</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Bush administration plan to transfer
authority over stock index futures from the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission to the rival Securities and Exchange Commission
could tie up needed legislative reforms for both agencies, say
officials.
   The Treasury Department unveiled the measure Tuesday _ almost a
month after indicating it would propose legislation to end the turf
battle between the futures market overseer and the stock market
regulator.
   The CFTC and the SEC have been locked in an escalating war of
words over which should oversee financial products that have
elements of both a security and a futures contract. Such hybrid
products include stock index futures, which allow investors to
speculate on movements in the stock market without having to buy the
underlying stocks.
   The administration's bill would ``unify regulation under the SEC
of the `one market' of stocks, stock options and stock index
futures,'' according to a Treasury fact sheet.
   But in a speech delivered earlier Tuesday, Mary L. Schapiro, an
SEC commissioner, worried that the bill had slim prospects for
passage in the dwindling congressional session because ``this is a
highly divisive, emotionally charged issue on Capitol Hill.''
   And ``while we wallow in the jurisdictional quagmire, other
critically important legislation may be held up,'' Ms. Schapiro told
the National Economists Club. She favors an outright merger of the
SEC and CFTC.
   The chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, Rep. Kika de la
Garza, D-Texas, said switching authority from one agency to another
``is not a solution.''
   The courts have interpreted the Commodity Exchange Act as giving
the CFTC regulatory authority over any financial product with even
the slightest aspect of a futures contract.
   But SEC and Treasury officials have complained that this has led
to long and costly legal battles while innovative financial products
are being developed or copied in overseas markets _ hurting American
competitiveness.
   The administration bill would modify the ``exclusivity clause''
of the Commodity Exchange Act to give the SEC authority over stock
index futures.
   The move has been opposed vehemently by the CFTC and its
supporters on Capitol Hill, mostly on the agriculture committees of
the House and Senate.
   They have claimed that giving stock index futures to the SEC will
hobble the CFTC's ability to regulate other futures contracts and
reduce liquidity in the markets.
   De la Garza asked the Treasury to submit legislative proposals
``to improve CFTC's regulation of the markets for stock index
futures.''
   Noting that a CFTC reform bill has been passed in the House but
remains tied up in committee in the Senate over the stock index
futures issue, de la Garza called on the Senate to ``act on the CFTC
reauthorization bill at the earlist possible time so we can go to
conference and produce a final bill that gives the CFTC the powers
that it needs.''
   In proposing the bill, Treasury officials maintained Tuesday that
the only real change would be the name of the regulator because
stock index futures would be regulated ``under the basic structure
of the Commodity Exchange Act, not as securities.''
   The administration claimed the disruption to the futures markets
would be minimal because ``stock index futures represent less than
10 percent of the futures volume under CFTC jurisdiction.''
   The bill also would give authority for setting margins _ the
downpayment investors must make when buying securities on credit _
on stock index futures to the SEC.
   Currently margins on futures contracts are set by the exchanges
themselves, usually at a fraction of the 50 percent required in
securities transactions. Stock market margins are set by the Federal
Reserve Board. The Fed favors placing margin-setting authority under
one agency, although it hasn't said which agency it favors.

<HEAD>Macy Says It's Examining Ways to Restructure Debt</HEAD>

   Investors bid up the price of R.H. Macy &amp; Co.
Inc.'s junk bonds after the retailer said it was looking at ways of
restructuring its ponderous $5.67 billion debt.
   Macy disclosed the news Tuesday in a letter to stockholders that
accompanied its third-quarter results.
   Investors and creditors have been concerned about Macy's
financial health since the retailer suffered a $39 million loss in
its second quarter, which includes the crucial Christmas shopping
season.
   The company, which is still paying down debt from its $3.74
billion leveraged buyout in 1986, told its stockholders, ``We have
been actively examining opportunities to reduce or refinance our
debt.''
   ``We will continue to explore these alternatives in the hope of
benefitting from current market conditions and opportunities,'' the
letter said.
   The company also said it expected its results from the current
quarter ``to be somewhat improved'' from the same period of last
year.
   Word of the letter reached trading rooms in late afternoon and
boosted the price of Macy's 14{ percent bonds due in 2001 by $2.50,
to $67 per $100 face amounte. The retailer's 14{ percent bonds due
in 1998 rose $3 to $56.50.
   The company's bonds took a hit recently after several creditors _
known as factors _ said they were reconsidering their standards for
financing shipments to Macy.
   Some of the concerns were eased May 25, when the company said its
cash flow, the key to paying down its debt, rose 4 percent during
the third quarter. On Tuesday, Macy said it lost $63.1 million in
its fiscal third quarter ended April 28. It lost $64.1 million in
the same period a year earlier.
   Sales in the period edged up to $1.49 billion from $1.48 billion.
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Macy reported a
loss of $135.3 million, compared with a loss of $10.5 million a year
earlier. Sales rose to $5.64 billion from $5.38 billion.
   Macy ran into trouble during the Christmas season _ a time when
it hoped to earn about half of its annual profits _ because it was
forced to slash prices to compete with Campeau Corp.'s department
stores.
   Campeau's chains had cut their prices as they tried to bring in
customers and avoid filing for bankruptcy court protection from
their creditors. The attempt was in vain _ the chains filed for
Chapter 11 reorganization in January.
   ``It is no secret that we had a down Christmas quarter last
year,'' Macy said Tuesday.
   ``Our game plan is working and it should yield significant
improvement in cash flow and a return to historical levels of
profitability for our November through January quarter,'' the
retailer said.
   The company said it had discussed its outlook with several
factors, and, ``We feel that this information was appreciated by the
factors.''

<TEXT>
   The Jack Eckerd Corp. is acquiring 220
Revco drugstores in five states in a deal that will make Eckerd
Drugs the nation's second-largest pharmaceuticals chain, both
companies announced.
   Jack Eckerd Corp., which owns 1,575 Eckerd Drugs outlets in 13
states, said Tuesday it is buying the Revco stores for an
undisclosed price from Revco D.S. Inc., based in Twinsburg, Ohio.
   Revco filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Federal
Bankruptcy Act two years ago.
   If completed, the sale would make Eckerd's drug store chain the
nation's second-largest, with a total of 1,795 outlets.
   Jack Eckerd Corp. is buying the Revco stores through its holding
company, Eckerd Holdings II Inc. The holding company was formed by
management with Merrill Lynch Capital Partners, a New York-based
investment banking company.
   Under the deal, Eckerd is to buy Revco stores in Florida,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas.
   The sale is subject to approval by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. A
hearing is expected later this month, according to a statement
issued by Eckerd.
   In Florida, Eckerd will purchase 43 of Revco's 55 stores.
   In Twinsburg, Ohio, Revco announced Tuesday it plans to to sell
its remaining 12 stores in Florida.
   Last January, Revco announced plans to sell 712 of its stores in
17 states in a bid to reduce the number of its stores to about 1,100
in 10 eastern states.
   The trade magazine ``Drug Store News'' reported at the end of
last year that Revco was No. 2 in the nation. The industry's largest
chain, according to the publication, was Rite Aid Corp., based in
Shiremanstown, Penn., which has 2,353 stores.
   Jack Eckerd Corp. also operates 233 Express Photo Labs, 33
Visionworks and 57 Eckerd Optical Centers in 13 states.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Files Fraud Charges Against Drexel Unit Officers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prosecutor has filed criminal charges
against three former officers of the Spanish unit of Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. for alleged fraudulent trading practices.
   Madrid Superior Court prosecutor Jesus Silva Pinto's filing
Tuesday accused the three men of using fraudulent business documents
to obtain shares during the partial privatization of the
state-controlled Repsol SA oil firm in April 1989, court sources
said Wednesday.
   The criminal charges were believed to be the first filed against
a securities firm in Spain for actions that until now have been
handled through administrative sanctions, according to the sources,
who asked to remain anonymous.
   If convicted, the former executives of now defunct DBL Capital
Markets Espana SA could face maximum prison sentences of 12 years.
   Spain's National Securities Commission opened an investigation
into the case in June 1989 and ruled DBL Capital Markets Espana had
committed ``a very serious infraction'' of trading practices during
the Repsol privatization.
   Last November, the watchdog agency recommended the Economy
Ministry fine the brokerage $556,725, or five times the amount of
gross profits made in the operation, the maximum fine under law.
   The watchdog agency then turned over its evidence to the Madrid
Superior Court prosecutor's office to determine whether the
infraction constituted criminal fraud punishable by law.
   The Spanish unit's U.S. parent company has filed for federal
bankruptcy protection after pleading guilty last year to charges in
connection with a widespread probe of insider trading.

<TEXT>
   A former top executive of the A&amp;P supermarket
chain gave inside information about proposed supermarket takeovers
to five friends and business associates, the Securities and Exchange
Commission has charged.
   The charges were made in a civil lawsuit filed Tuesday by the
Securities and Exchange Commission against Alan C. Goulding, A&amp;P's
former senior executive vice president and chief operating officer,
and five other men who allegedly traded securities based on the
information from Goulding.
   The commission said the defendants had agreed to settle the
charges, without admitting guilt.
   Goulding, 60, of Allendale, N.J., will pay a penalty of $635,000,
and the other five will pay a total of $1.46 million in penalties
and alleged illegal profits.
   A&amp;P, the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Co. Inc., operates a
nationwide chain of supermarkets based in Montvale, N.J.
   The lawsuit said that from May 1986 through March 1987, Goulding
learned, through his position at the company, of proposed takeovers
by A&amp;P of three competitors _ Shopwell Inc., Delchamps Inc. and
Waldbaum Inc.
   Knowing it was non-public, Goulding improperly passed on the
information to three friends or associates who then bought and sold
stock in the targeted companies, the SEC said.
   One of the recipients, Murray Verlin, 68, of Miami, a part owner
of a food distribution company called Pure Maid Inc., in turn tipped
off two of his friends about the information from Goulding, the
lawsuit said.
   The SEC alleged that Goulding also told Verlin about a favorable
earnings report in March 1987, before A&amp;P released the figures to
the public and that Verlin made money trading on A&amp;P stock.
   Goulding took early retirement from A&amp;P in July of 1987, company
spokesman Michael Rourke said.
   In addition to Goulding and Verlin, the other defendants in the
lawsuit are: Robert J. Foley, 68, of Redwood City, Calif., a
self-employed food marketing consultant; Joel Lopate, 56, of Miami,
no occupation given; Kurt Goldman, 65, of Boca Raton, Fla.,
ex-president of Johanna Farms Dairy, a New Jersey supplier of dairy
products; and Peter Goldman, 62, of Boca Raton, Fla., a former
executive vice president of Johanna Farms Dairy.

termination notice from Clairol Inc. last year, he quickly found a
new employer: himself.
   Quiroga, a former factory manager at the leading beauty products
firm in Stamford, Conn., decided to ditch the corporate mainstream
and start his own small business.
   Now he sets his own hours and signs all the checks for a
franchise branch of Mailboxes Etc., an office products and postal
services chain, in the nearby town of Fairfield.
   Quiroga's new life hasn't freed him from worrying about the
amount of cash in the bank. Accustomed to company health plans after
19 years, he panicked when his 17-year-old son got hurt a month ago
and had to be rushed to the hospital. He wasn't sure if his wife's
insurance policy would cover the bill.
   Nonetheless, Quiroga said, he likes running a small business. So,
apparently, do other former executives who have started their own
companies after losing jobs in corporate overhauls.
   Thousands of lower-and mid-level executives have been laid off in
the dizzying era of mergers, takeovers and restructurings that have
reshaped the face of corporate America in recent years.
   The National Planning Association, a Washington-based business
research organization, estimates that based on government
statistics, plant closings and other corporate staff reductions have
displaced an estimated 2 million workers a year since the late 1970s.
   Most executive victims of this workforce readjustment have sought
jobs with other businesses, where they find comfort and security in
a steady salary and benefits, said Joan Learn, president of The
Greenwich Group, an executive counseling firm that encourages
executives to consider self-employment.
   But evidence suggests a growing number of these people are
viewing pink slips as golden opportunities to become their own
bosses, selling everything from flowers to computer software.
Experts say part of the reason is the insecurity that layoff victims
feel by going to work for someone else again.
   Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, a Chicago-based consulting and
executive placement company, estimates the number of laid-off
executives who have become entrepreneurs has tripled in the past
five years, from 7 percent of the total in 1985 to about 20 percent
today. The company bases the estimate on its own quarterly surveys
of 600 displaced managers around the country.
   ``There is no question that a prime factor in the decision to
become an entrepreneur is concern over another discharge,'' said
James Challenger, company president. ``These people are hoping to
guarantee that they will never again hear an employer tell them they
no longer have a job.''
   Kathleen Purdy walked down both career paths when she was laid
off as director of internal management consulting for Infilco Corp.
of Meriden, Conn. She started looking for new jobs with help from
Learn, but also drafted a plan to form her own consulting firm.
   She chickened out when time came to launch the plan, instead
accepting a job as a marketing director for Onsite Energy, a
subsidiary of PacifiCorp. in Portland, Ore.
   But when she got laid off from that job two years later, she took
the plunge.
   ``I decided to go for it, and I'm just delighted,'' said Purdy,
whose consulting firm opened in January. ``It's working out very
well.''
   Going it alone isn't always easy for the corporate type, however,
especially middle managers who have staked their professional
careers on loyalty to a well-established business with thousands of
employees.
   ``You miss the camaraderie of your associates. You miss the
second-family society that a large company has to offer. You make a
lot of good friends when you're working at large corporations,''
said Dan McCarthy, a former senior executive at Pitney Bowes Inc., a
leading office-equipment maker in Stamford.
   McCarthy left the company on his own last September when it
announced a restructuring that watered down his job. He's just
getting started running a franchise branch of Remedy Temporary
Services, an employment agency.
   Many displaced executives find they must readjust their focus
away from expense accounts and profit-and-loss statements, and
toward concern for their customers, whom they are often meeting face
to face for the first time.
   ``Having been senior management for the last 18, 19 years, there
is a management syndrome you have to be careful of _ you can't just
sit at your desk and feel you're going to be firing off a lot of
orders to people,'' said McCarthy, who spent 29 years at NCR Corp.
in Dayton, Ohio, before he went to Pitney Bowes and then ventured
out on his own.
   ``There is a big difference in coming out of a corporate
structure, where things are much more formalized and there are many
long meetings and a certain amount of politics that exist in every
company,'' he said. ``That's fine for that way of life, but it
doesn't work for the entrepreneur. You have to keep the customer in
mind every time.''
   Many former executives who turn to self-employment say they find
a new source of energy and excitement in their layoff afterlife that
compensates for the anxieties.
   ``I'm getting more of a kick out of doing this than I'd ever
anticipated,'' McCarthy said. ``It allows me to bring forth all the
experiences I had in the past and use that effort and energy on my
own behalf.''
   Learn, who runs The Greenwich Group with her husband, said the
firm has grown steadily since its founding four years ago, largely
because of corporate restructurings and growing interest in
self-employment. They estimate they will help 300 to 400 people from
50 to 60 companies this year.
   So far, only one of the firm's would-be entrepreneur clients has
given up _ an executive who underestimated his need to be around
people. He sold the business and went back to work for someone else.
The rest appear to be thriving, Learn said.
   ``Even though it's risky, it just feels right,'' Purdy said.
``You start creating things and you realize you have the power to
create the income, to create the business. In a way, it's more
security because you control it. It's not a company that may have to
downsize. There isn't security in corporations anymore.''

<HEAD>Five-Pound Note Shrinks And The Queen Ages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain introduced a smaller five pound note
Wednesday that includes a new engraving of a gracefully aging queen.
   The change _ the first in two decades _ is designed to combat
high-tech forgeries and cut production costs. The new note is
scheduled to be released into circulation on Thursday.
   ``No item created by man can't be recreated,'' said Nigel
Bevitt-Smith, manager of design and development at the Bank of
England's printing works. ``What we try to do is to make it
time-consuming and as expensive as possible.''
   The five-pound notes have been reduced in size from 5.7-by-3
inches to 5.3-by-2.7 inches.
   Among the other changes, the dominant blue in the notes was
lightened from navy to turquoise, and a blend of background colors
was created to challenge sophisticated forgers who use modern color
reproduction machines.
   Also, the position and color of the numbers was changed and a
silver-colored windowed thread running through the note was added.
   The Bank of England, which already has printed 200 million of the
new notes, said Queen Elizabeth's new portrait shows the monarch
``gracefully aged,'' rather than as a delicate brunette young enough
to be Prince Charles' sister.
   Railway pioneer George Stephenson replaces the Duke of Wellington
on the new notes.
   All English notes will be redesigned over the next four years and
will be between 16 percent and 22 percent smaller, the Bank of
England said.

   For years he's played a real-life game of
Monopoly with such swagger that it seemed the stakes were play
money. Now a cash crunch may force the tycoon to trade away his
yacht, his hotels or his casinos.
   Donald Trump _ whose name adorns everything from airplanes to
board games, usually in large letters _ may also have to wave
arrivederci to the glitzy, fast-lane lifestyle he enjoyed during his
rise in the 1980s.
   Creditors reportedly are pressing the multimillionaire for cash,
and negotiations that are under way could compel Trump to sell huge
chunks of his empire.
   The real estate and casino magnate has a reported $2 billion in
bank debt. His holdings, once estimated at $1.5 billion, had been
sliced to $500 million, Forbes magazine reported last month.
   The Taj Mahal, his centerpiece Atlantic City casino, is said to
be for sale. The Trump Princess, his yacht, is on the block. The
Trump Shuttle, his airline, is up for grabs.
   On Monday, bondholders filed a lawsuit accusing Trump of
promoting the Taj Mahal at the expense of the Trump Plaza and Trump
Castle in Atlantic City.
   Add to the equation his estranged wife, Ivana, who awaits her
share with a $25 million prenuptial agreement that's looking better
all the time.
   ``He'll have to trim the fat: get rid of the boat, the mansions,
the helicopter,'' one banker involved in the Trump talks told The
Wall Street Journal.
   While this answers the question ``What do you give the man who
has everything?'' _ cold, hard cash _ it raises another: what will
Donald be left with? Trump: The Living Room Carpet? The Trump Motel
and Drive-In Theater?
   Trump, through spokesman Dan Klores, declined to comment further
on the situation Tuesday. But The Donald never foresaw such problems
in his first self-congratulatory book, ``Trump: The Art of the
Deal.''
   ``I don't do it for the money. I've got enough, much more than
I'll ever need,'' Trump wrote in the 1988 best-seller. As recently
as April, the developer claimed he was selling off assets only to
become ``the king of cash.''
   Marvin Roffman was not swayed by such talk. The Philadelphia
gaming analyst predicted problems for the Taj Mahal, and he claims
Trump had him fired for saying so.
   Roffman, apparently vindicated by the reports of layoffs and
losses at the palatial resort, bit his tongue Tuesday and cited a
pending legal action. ``My attorneys have cautioned me, and I really
can't talk,'' he said.
   The New York tabloids had no such concerns, and the rumors of
impending financial crisis produced a round of entertaining
Trump-bashing.
   ``Uh-Owe!'' headlined the front page of the Post beneath a photo
of Trump. Inside, the paper posed the question ``The Taj: Eighth
Blunder Of The World?'' ``Trump In A Slump'' announced the Daily
News.
   ``To me, Trump sounds about two steps away from selling used
magazines on the sidewalk,'' wrote Daily News columnist Gail
Collins. At least one expert felt she might not be too far off.
   ``Trump just thought the real estate market was heading upwards
indefinitely and people would keep buying at higher and higher
prices. He forgot that whatever goes up must come down,'' said Abe
Wallach, an executive at the development firm First Capital Partners.
   At the very least, his financial problems could postpone
publication of Trump's latest laudatory book. Its unfortunate title:
``Trump: Surviving at the Top.''

   Administration and congressional bargainers
resumed their slow-moving budget talks today with a visit from
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, whose agency is a prime target for
spending cuts.
   Many congressional Democrats have been arguing for months that
with the breakup of the Warsaw Pact, the Pentagon's budget should be
cut. Republicans are more reluctant to make such reductions.
   ``I'm going to give them an old-fashioned Gospel revival-hour on
defense,'' the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services
Committee, John Warner of Virginia, said before entering the
closed-door meeting.
   The session, the fifth since bargaining began last month, comes
as Democrats and Republicans begin maneuvering for political
advantage over the annual spending bills for next year.
   Congress' majority Democrats said they would start working on the
appropriations measures in the House and Senate this week.
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, argued, however that those bills should
not be enacted until negotiators work out a deficit-cutting deal for
next year. He contended that if Democrats begin working on the
spending bills before a budget deal is reached, the measures will be
too expensive because they will not reflect any cuts set by the
budget bargainers.
   ``If they do that, it would represent a virtually insurmountable
obstacle to negotiating a good-faith compromise on the budget,''
said Gramm, one of the budget negotiators.
   But Democrats noted that the start of fiscal 1991 is Oct. 1, less
than four months away. ``We are reaching a critical stage here,''
said Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee.
   Democrats planned to begin subcommittee wok on spending bills in
the House as early as Thursday. Democrats said the full Senate could
begin considering a 1991 budget within two weeks. The budget is a
non-binding fiscal blueprint that lays the groundwork for spending
measures.
   The budget talks between the White House and Congress were
resuming after a break of nearly two weeks for lawmakers' Memorial
Day recess.
   So far, negotiators have reached an informal consensus to try
reduce next year's federal deficit by $45 billion to $60 billion.
They also want to find a total of $425 billion to $600 billion in
savings over the next five years.
   But there is still a long way to go. Democrats tend to prefer
deficit cuts in the high level of those ranges, while Republicans
favor lesser reductions.
   And the bargainers have not yet traded proposals for shrinking
the deficit by cutting spending and raising taxes. Such negotiating
is not expected to begin for at least a week.
   Because of easing East-West tensions, the Pentagon is expected to
bear a heavy portion of whatever spending cuts are worked out.
Cheney was stating the Defense Department's case at today's meeting.
   When President Bush submitted his budget in January, he proposed
spending $303.3 billion for defense in fiscal 1991. The House
approved a spending plan with $295.4 billion for the military, while
the Senate Budget Committee has earmarked $293.9 billion for defense
in its blueprint.
   The goal of the talks is to find a way to limit next year's red
ink to no more than $64 billion, as required by the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law. The White House says that unless something is
done, the 1991 budget gap could be $206 billion. That would be more
than double the $100.5 billion shortfall Bush predicted in January.

<HEAD>Hitachi Developes World's Fastest General-Purpose Computer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hitachi Ltd. of Japan said Wednesday it has
developed the world's fastest mainframe computer, the first time the
company has beaten industry leader IBM and other manufacturers to a
new-generation release.
   The Hitachi M-880 Processor family, to be released Friday, will
``allow us to catch up with IBM, and has increased our
competitiveness,'' Hitachi Vice President Takeo Miura told reporters.
   He said the new generation computers will use about 20 percent
less power and take up about half the space of the latest processor
family developed by International Business Machines Corp.
   Hitachi, however, was not expected to ship the new models in
Japan until the fall and in the United States until the second
quarter of 1991, about the same time IBM was expected to have its
latest mainframe ready, said Don Young, an analyst for Sanford C.
Bernstein in New York.
   With IBM's next generation still an unknown quantity, ``I think
what we've got here is apples and oranges. Apples is Hitachi today
and oranges is IBM tomorrow,'' Young said.
   He added, however, that the announcement ``really makes (Hitachi)
an incredible player in this market and puts them into the range of
competing with IBM.''
   Hitachi said monthly lease charges on its new mainframes would
range from $512,450 to $1.02 million, about 10 percent to 15 percent
better than the pricing currently offered by IBM.
   ``I would surprised if we don't see a 10 to 15 percent price
improvement from IBM'' next year, Young said.
   Such general-purpose computers are mainly used for information
management systems in large corporations.
   IBM currently controls more than 70 percent of the U.S. mainframe
market; Amdahl Corp. is No. 2 with 10 percent to 15 percent and
Hitachi is a distant third with about of half of Amdahl's share,
Young said. In Japan, Hitachi also lags behind IBM and Fujitsu Ltd.
   The four new Hitachi models were developed in response to
customer demand for faster, more powerful computers, Miura said. All
are IBM-compatible, he said.
   The top-of-the-line M-880-420 is capable of performing at 155
million instructions a second, compared to 88 for Hitachi's current
high-end model and 122 for IBM's top-line model, the 3090 600J, the
company said.
   This is the first time Hitachi has beaten IBM and other
competitors such as Fujitsu and Amdahl to a new-generation release
in the mainframe market.

   Grain and soybean futures rose in early trading
today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   The market was boosted by follow-through buying from Tuesday's
strong close, said Victor Lespinasse, an analyst with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Corn futures were supported from delayed planting and the
possibility for reduced acreage.
   Analysts say both corn and soybeans are being helped by
predictions by a private weather forecaster that the Midwest could
be in for unusually hot and dry weather in late July and early
August.
   In early trading, wheat was a { cent to 1} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.30} a bushel; corn was 1 cent to
2{ cents higher with July at $2.79{ a bushel; oats were a { cent to

to 5} cents higher with July at $5.95{ a bushel.
   Livestock and pork futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Cattle prices were higher, boosted by active meat sales, which
indicates strong demand.
   Pork futures were mostly lower on steady to lower cash hog prices
and expectations of lower pork product prices.
   Live cattle were .10 cent lower to .08 cent higher with June at
75.05 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .13 cent
higher with August at 85.02 cents a pound; hogs were .37 cent to .80
cent lower with June at 66.27 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were 1 cent lower to .45 cent higher with July at 66.30 cents a
pound.
   Livestock and pork futures settled higher in Tuesday's trading.

   The U.S. dollar ended slightly lower Wednesday
against other major currencies in thin European trading.
   Gold prices rose.
   Currency dealers said the dollar was trapped within a
well-established trading range in the absence of any fresh
market-moving news.
   The dollar started out higher in Tokyo, rising 0.17 yen to a
closing 152.60 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at 152.45 yen,
and by midday in New York it was trading at 152.55 yen.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.6880, compared with
$1.6820 late Tuesday. Sterling bought $1.68955 in New York at midday.

<HEAD>IHI to Join Rolls Royce in Producing New Plane Engine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Japanese manufacturing conglomerate announced
Wednesday that it has joined forces with Rolls Royce PLC of Britain
in producing parts of Rolls Royce aircraft engines for use in Boeing
Co.'s as-yet undeveloped 777 jetliner.
   The agreement in principle calls for Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy
Industries Co. to undertake 5 percent of the production of a
proposed Trent 800 engine, said IHI official Masahide Wakamatsu.
   IHI would produce such parts as a turbine blades and shafts, he
said.
   IHI and Rolls Royce will discuss details of the project after
Boeing decides whether to use the Trent 800 engine for the 777,
Wakamatsu said. Boeing expects to begin development on the
350-to-360-passenger jetliner this summer.
   A Boeing spokesman said Wednesday the three major builders of
large engines _ Rolls, General Electric Co. and Pratt &amp; Whitney Co.
_ would probably all come up with engines suited for service on the
777.
   If Boeing accepts the Rolls engine, the company would in turn
offer it to its customers, who would make the decision on which
engine to use, the spokesman, John Wheeler, said from the company's
headquarters in Seattle.
   Wheeler said first deliveries of the 777 jetliner are expected in
mid-1995.

<HEAD>Grain and Soybean Futures Prices Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
higher Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   The market was heavily influenced by reports that a cloud with
unidentified contents was heading towards Finland from the Soviet
Union, said John Frazier, an analyst with Gerald Inc. in Chicago.
   The cloud was first spotted over the Soviet Union on May 26,
according to Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Authority. An
agency spokesman said Wednesday the USSR had not informed them of
any radioactivity in the cloud.
   The reports triggered speculation about possible damage to
farmland in those areas that could mean stronger demand for U.S.
grains and soybeans.
   Also influencing the market was a weather outlook by a private
forecaster that calls for unusually hot, dry weather in the Midwest
in late July and early August. The heat is forecast for a period
when corn and soybeans mature.
   In addition to news of the unidentified cloud, soybean futures
received a boost from strong cash markets for soybeans, light
selling by farmers and the continuing Brazilian port shutdown.
   Wheat futures received some support from commercial and
speculative buying, although forecasts of warm weather that would
speed the harvesting of the winter wheat crop weighed on prices.
   At the close, wheat was } cent to 2{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.31} a bushel; corn was 1\ cents
lower to 2} cents higher with July at $2.81 a bushel; oats were a {

   The Seagram Co. Ltd. said Wednesday its profit
fell 4.6 percent in its first fiscal quarter, citing sharply lower
results from its investment in the Du Pont Co.
   The beverage company said its net income fell to $187 million, or
$1.97 per share, in the three months ended April 30 from $196
million, or $2 per share, in the same period a year earlier.
   Revenue rose 5.4 percent to $1.29 billion from $1.23 billion in
the same period last year.
   Operating income increased 25.6 percent to $157 million from $125
million in the same period of 1989.
   But Seagram said unremitted earnings from its 24.3 percent stake
in E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. tumbled to $79 million from $108
million a year earlier. Its dividend income from the Du Pont
investment rose to $66 million from $58 million a year earlier,
however.
   ``We are pleased with the increases in operating income and
sales, which reflect the strength of our international spirits and
wine operations as well as an unexpectedly strong performance from
our Brazilian affiliate,'' company President Edgar Bronfman Jr. said
in a statement.
   Seagram makes and markets distilled spirits, wines, wine coolers,
fruit juices and soft drinks. Its brands include Glenlivet Scotch
Whiskies, Seagram's Extra Dry Gin, Martell Cognacs, Barton &amp;

<HEAD>No Bidders Emerge for Sakowitz Chain; Liquidation Planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All but one of the Sakowitz specialty stores were
slated for liquidation after no bids were received for the
Texas-based retailer at a bankruptcy court hearing Wednesday.
   The once-proud chain, which includes four stores in Houston, one
in Dallas and another in Cincinnati, is 80 percent owned by L.J.
Hooker Corp. Hooker has been disposing of its assets under
bankruptcy court supervision.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Tina Brozman indicated she would
approve the plan to liquidate all of the Texas Sakowitz stores and a
formal order was expected to be issued soon. Going-out-of-business
sales would start soon thereafter and run through the end of July.
   The Sakowitz in Cincinnati's Forest Fair Mall would remain open.
Business at the shopping mall, another Hooker holding, could suffer
if the store closed. Similar arrangements were made when Hooker
divested its Bonwit Teller and B. Altman &amp; Co. department store
chains. Hooker has kept the Altman's and Bonwit Teller stores open
for business at the Forest Fair Mall. Hooker also has continued
operating a Bonwit Teller in a Columbia, S.C. mall that it owns.
   The Sakowitz chain, headquartered in Houston, has about 450
employees. It has focused on women's apparel and accessories. During
much of its 88 years in business, the chain enjoyed a good
reputation for quality and fashion sense.
   But in the mid-1980s a struggling regional economy due largely to
the oil price slump proved too much for Sakowitz. It entered
bankruptcy court proceedings in 1985.
   Sakowitz reorganized in Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code
and emerged from court protection under the stewardship of a new
company that teamed up with Hooker. At that time, Hooker acquired
its 80 percent stake.
   An attorney for Hooker, Sheldon I. Hirshon, said at the hearing
that Sakowitz never succeeded in really turning itself around. In
the year ended Jan. 31, 1990, Sakowitz suffered a net operating loss
of $4.4 million and lost $1.3 million in the past three months,
Hirshon said.
   At the hearing, Hooker invited bids for either its interest in
Sakowitz or the assets of the chain. No bidders came forward.
   An attorney for Robert T. Sakowitz, formerly president and chief
executive officer of the chain, told the court that Sakowitz had
wanted to make an offer but needed more time to arrange financing.
Sakowitz didn't make a formal bid and Judge Brozman moved the case
forward.
   Sakowitz, who attended the hearing and spoke with reporters,
expressed regret at the chain's fate and disputed the implication
that it was beyond redemption.
   He distributed a personal statement in which he said the
complications of Hooker's bankruptcy proceedings discouraged many
domestic and foreign investors from joining him in bidding for
Sakowitz.
   With the liquidation of Sakowitz, Hooker will have disposed of
the bulk of its retail holdings that were acquired since 1986. The
Atlanta-based company, which still has various commercial and
residential property holdings, is a subsidiary of Australia's Hooker
Corp.
   Sydney-based Hooker is being managed by a court-appointed
provisional liquidator in a process similar to what its American
subsidiary is experiencing in the U.S. bankruptcy court.

<HEAD>Slumping Brokerage Announces Major Overhaul</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. overhauled its
operations Wednesday, reviving a respected investment banking name
and dumping a vestige of its expansionist 1980s in a bid to rebound
from record losses on Wall Street.
   The restructuring marks another step by parent American Express
Co. to reverse the fortunes of the nation's second largest
brokerage, which lost $915 million in the first three months of the
year.
   Shearson said it was grouping into two divisions from four:
Shearson Lehman Brothers for individual investing and asset
management, and Lehman Brothers for investment banking and capital
markets activities. The full firm will be known as Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc.
   In the investment banking division, Shearson hopes resurrecting
the 140-year-old Lehman Brothers name will mean more respect and
cache during one of the slowest periods in Wall Street history.
   ``We hope the Lehman Brothers name will have the magic still,''
Shearson Chairman and Chief Executive Howard L. Clark Jr. said in an
interview. ``A little magic wouldn't hurt.''
   Shearson acquired the Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb Inc. investment
bank in 1984 as part of a rapid growth strategy during the
deal-heavy '80s, dubbing the new firm Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
_ same as the new one.
   Lehman Brothers dates to 1850, when it was founded by immigrants
from Bavaria as a commodities house in Montgomery, Ala. The
investment bank was among those dominating Wall Street in the early
1900s and grew rapidly after World War II.
   About 1,000 Lehman brothers veterans still work at Shearson, the
No.2 brokerage behind Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   Under then-chairman Peter Cohen, who was ousted earlier this year
by American Express Chairman James D. Robinson III, Shearson
acquired E.F. Hutton &amp; Co. shortly after the 1987 stock market crash.
   By dropping Hutton from its name, Shearson erases the public
connection with a merger that fostered a clash of corporate cultures
and has been called the firm's biggest expansion mistake.
   Clark said the new structure organizes the firm along customer
lines, with Shearson Lehman Brothers for individual investments and
Lehman Brothers for institutions. He said the new shape would
``focus accountability and responsibility of the business ... to
respond to client needs and interests.''
   Clark is part of the American Express invasion running the
Shearson overhaul. When he was picked to head the firm, he was chief
financial officer of American Express and his father is a former
chairman of the company.
   The credit card and travel service giant in recent months has put
more than $1 billion in capital into Shearson and is buying all of
the brokerage's remaining common stock. American Express now holds
61 percent of Shearson.
   Shearson lost an industry record $915 million in the first
quarter, in part because of expenses to pay for a restructuring
including about 2,000 layoffs. Most Wall Street firms have been
forced to cut back because of an industry slowdown since the stock
market crash. Shearson also has been criticized for bad management,
overexpansion and excessive spending during the last decade.
   Shearson said its Boston Co. money management subsidiary would
remain a separate business.
   Richard S. Fuld Jr., a Lehman veteran and current president of
Shearson's capital markets group, and Sherman R. Lewis Jr.,
president of investment and merchant banking, were named co-chief
executives of the new Lehman Brothers division.
   That division will serve corporations, governments and
institutions, including capital markets sales, research and trading,
as well as investment and merchant banking.
   As expected, Jonathan S. Linen, an American Express executive,
was named president and chief executive of the Shearson Lehman
Brothers division. Linen currently is president and chief executive
of American Express' direct marketing and travelers checks group.

<HEAD>Yeutter Says Costs Of No Mulitlateral Trade Agreement Would Be High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter warned
Wednesday that an agricultural trade war could result if a deadlock
over the United States' demands at international trade talks
continues through the end of the year.
   The United States is seeking the removal of European farm export
subsidies over 10 years.
   If no agreement is reached, ``I guarantee you the costs for some
of our trading partners would increase dramatically,'' said Yeutter,
the luncheon speaker at a forum sponsored by The Journal of Commerce
and the National Foreign Trade Council.
   ``The United States has to protect its own interests,'' Yeutter
said. ``I've thought about how we can do that and hope I can keep
those thoughts in the back of my mind and never have to surface
them.''
   Yeutter, while conceding that U.S. farm policies also distort
trade, said U.S. export subsidies amount to less than $1 billion a
year, while European help for farm exports comes to $10 billion
annually.
   ``We all have to go down the reform road together,'' Yeutter said.
   Yeutter said proposals for cutting European subsidies in half are
insufficient.
   The Common Market's export subsidies are intended to help
relatively expensive European farm products compete against
lower-priced goods in the world market.
   U.S. negotiators unsuccessfully pushed their call to stop export
subsidies, as well as an end to import barriers and domestic
subsidies, at a meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development last week in Paris.
   ``I am never surprised about intransigence on the part of the
European Community,'' Yeutter said of the deadlock.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills and other officials have
said the agricultural issue is the ``linchpin'' for all other topics
in the current round of negotiations under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, a forum for promoting freer trade.
   The talks, known as the Uruguay Round, began in that country in
1986 and are to end this December in Brussels. The negotiations
involve about 100 countries and are designed to reduce barriers to
trade.
   U.S. officials estimate that ending the farm subsidies could
boost U.S. agricultural exports by $11 billion annually.
   Common Market officials say the subsidies can be reduced, but not
eliminated because so many small farmers depend on them.
   Earlier at the forum, Andreas Van Agt, European Community
ambassador to the United States, said Europe would not agree
``unrealistic solutions that are politically unachievable,'' such as
abandoning subsidies.
   Among the areas of discussion held up by the deadlock are
textiles and services.
   Third World countries want fewer barriers to textile trade. The
United States, under pressure from the domestic textile industry,
has been seeking less comprehensive reduction of existing tariffs
and quotas. GATT doesn't cover textile trade, which is handled by
the Multi-Fiber Agreement between about 80 countries.
   The United States, however, is seeking to have GATT cover
financial services. Poorer countries are opposed to GATT regulation
of banking, investment and insurance so they can protect their
infant financial industries.
   The next formal meeting of negotiators is scheduled for July 23
in Geneva, Switzerland.

   When Lee Iacocca hired Gerald Greenwald to help
him rescue Chrysler Corp. from collapse, it began with a discreet
phone call to Greenwald's home in Caracas, Venezuela, where he
worked for Ford Motor Co.
   More than a decade later, a similar secret offer confronted
Greenwald again. Only this time, a UAL Corp. union coalition was
making the surreptitious contact, luring the Chrysler vice chairman
with the job of leading its effort to buy the airline company for
$4.54 billion.
   Why Greenwald vacated Chrysler, especially at a time when its
financial health again appears to be sliding dangerously, may be
debated for a long time.
   Greenwald and people who know him say he was lured away by the
enormous challenge of carrying off the UAL buyout, a debt-financed
deal that would result in the largest employee-owned company in the
country _ if successful.
   ``Here I am having a second chance to go through a major
industrial event in American history,'' Greenwald said when he made
the surprise announcement May 31 that he was quitting.
   Some auto industry people familiar with Greenwald, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said they're skeptical about his chances of
assembling the financing needed to purchase UAL, which has seen
several earlier buyout proposals fall through. The current climate
of tight credit won't make it any easier for him to meet an Aug. 9
deadline for raising the money.
   But others said that if anyone can coordinate the UAL effort it
is Greenwald. His calm and reassuring manner was critical in winning
the confidence of skeptical lenders to Chrysler in the early 1980s
and helped convince the federal government to provide $1.5 billion
in loan guarantees.
   ``I could not think of anybody better suited to put together the
awesome financial arrangements that the buyers of UAL are trying to
do. He has tremendous talent with bankers,'' said Jerry H. Pyle, a
former Chrysler executive who now is president of Gulf States Toyota
in Houston.
   ``Mr. Iacocca handled the Feds and Jerry handled the bankers and
I'm not sure he didn't have a tougher job than Lee did,'' Pyle said.
   In Greenwald's 11-year tenure with Chrysler, he established
himself as a careful, deliberate, diplomatic and soft-spoken
complement to Iacocca, the scrappy chairman of the No. 3 automaker.
   Greenwald is considered largely responsible for imposing the
financial discipline that resurrected Chrysler's profitability and
made himself and Iacocca wealthy in the process.
   The two men could hardly be more different. Iacocca, 65, is a
profane, flamboyant engineer and the son of Italian Catholic
immigrants. Greenwald, 54, is son of Russian Jewish poultry
wholesalers. He grew up in St. Louis, attended Princeton on an Eagle
Scout scholarship, rose in the auto industry as a financier and is
known to think carefully before making any important move.
   ``Iacocca was bombastic,'' one former Chrysler executive said.
``Jerry would examine off-the-wall ideas all the way to the obvious.
A lot of times he would take the more obtuse direction. He was very
much solicitous of the opinions of other people. But he would come
to the point of having examined this whole thing and say, `OK, this
is the way we should go.'''
   Despite their contrasting styles, both men developed a warm
friendship, and Greenwald widely was considered Iacocca's likely
successor. But Greenwald always treated the talk about taking
Iacocca's place with self-effacing modesty. ``I don't think anyone
is going to step into Lee's 21-inch shoes and walk the way he
does,'' Greenwald once said.
   Greenwald's early experience in the auto business may have helped
him prepare for his tenure at troubled Chrysler, which lost $1.1
billion in 1979 and $1.7 billion in 1980.
   His first job came with Ford in 1957, as a personnel
administrator for a new division called Edsel. It collapsed in three
months. Greenwald later recollected: ``I wondered how I could have
done so badly so soon.''
   But his career fared better than the Edsel. He moved into
financial analysis and by the late 1960s was concentrating on Ford's
Latin American operations.
   The company promoted him to management positions in Brazil,
Paris, London and Caracas over most of the following 10 years. It
was a life of 12-hour workdays and regular household-moving
upheavals for wife Glenda and their four children.
   Greenwald liked life abroad, but the prospect of rising further
in Ford's hierarchy remained unclear. So the phone call from Iaccoca
in the spring of 1979, offering Greenwald a quantum leap in stature,
wasn't unwelcome.
   Despite the close Iacocca-Greenwald relationship that developed
over the next decade, speculation persisted about the succession
question at Chrysler. The question was compounded by Iacocca's vague
plans about retirement and the automaker's financial backslide in
recent years.
   ``Clearly there was some kind of a battle shaping up over
there,'' a former executive said. ``There is a certain amount of
satisfaction and adrenalin that goes into the kind of situation that
he and we all had at Chrysler _ putting it all back together and
making it succeed.
   ``Once you've done that, then it didn't work out too well, it's
down-on-your-knees time again.''
   Some people familiar with Greenwald speculated privately that he
was excited at the prospect of going into a new industry and defying
the skepticism that a large employee-owned airline will succeed.
   ``I think he figures he's got a better chance of doing that than
taking over an unhealthy Chrysler Corporation and making it work,''
one former Chrysler official said.
   Greenwald isn't considered extravagant or publicity hungry, and
is known for quiet demonstrations of generosity. For example, he set
up a college scholarship program for 50 fifth-graders in the public
schools of University City, Mo., where he grew up. It could cost him
$775,000 if all go on to get undergraduate degrees.
   Greenwald's wife, who established an independent writing career
while the family was abroad, founded and runs the magazine Michigan
Woman. It appears there will be no immediate changes in her
professional life while her husband jets from home in the Detroit
suburb of Bloomfield Hills to UAL's base in Chicago and to New York,
where lies much of the money he seeks.
   ``We jokingly say if you've got to commute,'' Greenwald said,
``have one of the spouses run an airline.''

<HEAD>Central Bankers Optimistic About German Currency Unification</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials of the central banks of Japan,
France, England and the United States expressed confidence Wednesday
in the ability of West Germany's central bank to control inflation
after East and West Germany merge their currencies next month.
   There has been concern that the plan could lead to inflation in
West Germany because East Germans will be able to exchange some of
their non-onvertible Ostmarks for the West German mark, leading to a
vast increase in the spending power of East Germans.
   Inflation in West Germany, the dominant economy in Europe, could
force the nation's central bank, the Bundesbank, to raise interest
rates. That could unsettle world financial markets and lead to
higher rates in other countries.
   But central bankers gathered at the annual International Monetary
Conference told reporters they are unconcerned about that prospect
because of the careful plans for monetary unification laid out by
the West German government.
   Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, said he
believes there will be a 10 percent increase in West Germany's money
supply as a result of much of East Germany's currency being
converted into marks. That increase is roughly equal to the expected
rise in the gross domestic product of the nations due to the
unification, he said.``So it looks as though the immediate monetary
situation is one of match, and therefore the immediate effect on
interest rates may be neutral,'' he said.
   He said the Bundesbank ``has been confronted with a novel,
difficult political situation, and in my opinion, they've handled it
extremely well.''
   Jacques de Larosiere, governor of the Bank of France, said, ``The
way this process is being handled, the rapidity of the elaboration
of the (monetary unification) treaty, the way things have been
carved out in terms of the monetary devices _ all goes well for the
stability of system and for interest rates.''
   Takeshi Ohta, deputy governor of the Bank of Japan, said he also
was confident about the ability of West Germany's monetary
authorities to ensure a smooth transition to a unified currency.
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said world interest
rates already have a ``presumed forecast'' for the impact of the
monetary unification, but that many unknown factors remain.
   ``There are a number of market forces that are involved in this
process which will override whatever particular agreements are
made,'' he said.
   ``It is quite conceivable (that) to the extent that events
deviate from the markets' expectations, that rates either in Germany
or elsewhere could either go up or down,'' he added.
   Bundesbank President Karl Otto Pohl originally was scheduled to
attend the session but canceled several weeks ago, apparently due to
constraints on his time in the face of the unification plan,
conference organizers said. The conference brought together
government and commercial bankers from 22 nations.
   On another topic, Greenspan was asked why the Federal Reserve has
not acted recently to ease U.S. interest rates in light of signs of
domestic economic weakness.
   ``The signs in the economy at this stage are really quite
ambiguous in that respect,'' he said.
   He said it is true that the rate of economic growth is
``exceptionally slow,'' but that the unemployment rate has hardly
changed in recent months.
   ``What we are seeing is a really quite unusual phenomenon,
namely, very slow labor force growth and a corresponding rather slow
economy associated with it, but we do not as yet see any underlying
(economic) deterioration,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dollar Up in U.S.; Gold Off</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar gained against all major currencies
except its Canadian counterpart in sluggish domestic trading
Wednesday marked by various international considerations.
   Gold prices posted moderate declines in the United States after
moving slightly higher abroad.
   Foreign exchange dealers reported trading volume was light.
   A series of concerns depressed the Swiss franc and West German
mark, steering investors to the dollar.
   Confirmation that Switzerland is seeking to join the
International Monetary Fund and speculation about possible declines
in Swiss interest rates encouraged selling of the franc, said
Richard Levine, a first vice president at Merrill Lynch Futures.
   The West German mark came under renewed pressure amid reports of
a potential strike by thousands of workers in East Germany.
Unconfirmed rumors of a possible accident at a Soviet nuclear power
plant _ stemming from reports that Finnish authorities were checking
a large cloud drifting toward their country _ also weakened the mark.
   But Levine said the nuclear accident rumor didn't have a
significant impact on currency trading overall.
   The dollar started out higher in Tokyo, rising 0.17 Japanese yen
to a closing 152.60 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at 152.45
yen. By the time trading finished in New York, the dollar was quoted
at 152.68 yen, up from 152.35 yen late Tuesday.
   The British pound was quoted at $1.6880, compared with $1.6820
late Tuesday. Sterling weakened in later U.S. trading, dipping to
$1.6875 late in New York from $1.6880 late Tuesday.
   Selected late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.6885 West German marks, up from
1.6840; 1.4365 Swiss francs, up from 1.4280; 5.6905 French francs,
up from 5.6785; 1,242.00 Italian lire, up from 1,240.00; and 1.16975
Canadian dollars, down from 1.17605 Canadian.
   The Canadian dollar's strength was tied to various political
developments in that country. There was talk in the market that a
rift between the Maritime Provinces and the rest of the country
wasn't as serious as previously believed.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with late
Tuesday's levels, included: 1.6870 West German marks, down from
1.6910; 1.4280 Swiss francs, down from 1.4340; 5.6870 French francs,
down from 5.7020; 1.8980 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9070; 1,241.00
Italian lire, down from 1,244.25; and 1.1723 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1752.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for June
delivery settled at $357.40 a troy ounce, down $2.40 from Tuesday.
Republic National Bank in New York quoted a troy ounce of gold
bullion at $356.75 as of 4 p.m. EDT, $2.25 lower than Tuesday's late
bid.
   In London, gold bullion traded late Wednesday at a bid of $359.50
a troy ounce, up 25 cents from late Tuesday. In Zurich, the bid was
$358.60 an ounce, unchanged from late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.55 to close at $361.42 an
ounce.
   Silver prices also were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for June delivery settled at $5.030 a troy ounce, down from
$5.065 Tuesday. Silver rose slightly in London at a bid of $5.085
per troy ounce, compared to $5.08 late Tuesday.

<HEAD>Midwest Seen as Most Popular Region for Real Estate Invesment in
Early 90s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STANLEY D. MILLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Midwest, California and the Southwest will see
the biggest increases in real estate investment in the next two
years, leading real estate executives and economists predicted in a
study released here Wednesday.
   The specialists, however, see a sluggish real estate market
overall through 1995, citing recent overbuilding as the major
detriment. They expect the market to grow more slowly than the
consumer price index in the first half of the decade.
   The experts also expect a decline in available capital, including
foreign investment. Some respondents see a catastrophic impact on
real estate from the savings and loan crisis, but others believe the
worst already has come.
   The nationwide survey, mailed in January, compiles responses of
400 real estate specialists to forecast the real estate market for
the next five years.
   The study was conducted by Ernst &amp; Young Real Estate Advisory
Services and the National Real Estate Index, a computer service that
tracks real estate values and rents.
   Houston was cited as offering the best overall potential for real
estate investment over the next five years. Dallas-Fort Worth was
the second choice, followed by Los Angeles, Seattle and Washington.
   Despite the overall prediction of a slow market, 28.4 percent of
the respondents said their firms would increase investment in the
Midwest in the next two years compared with spending in 1989.
   The specialists appear less enthusiastic about individual markets
in the Midwest, however. Only Chicago was selected among the top 10
investment markets nationwide, and only two others made the top 30 _
Columbus, Ohio, at 29 and Minneapolis-St. Paul at 30.
   ``I think part of that's a lack of knowledge'' about many
Midwestern cities, said Michael L. Evans, national director for Real
Estate Advisory Services in San Francisco, a branch of the
accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young.
   ``I think a lot of people view the Midwest as being Chicago,'' he
said. ``I think they were looking at the principal cities in each
region and perhaps didn't have the information about other cities.''
   Almost 26 percent of the respondents expect to spend more in
California, and 24 percent will invest more heavily in the
Southwest, the survey showed.
   But 21.4 percent of the specialists think they will spend less on
real estate in the Northeast, compared with 17.3 percent who expect
to spend more in the region.
   The decrease can be traced to the belief of 28.6 percent of the
analysts that New York City is the most overpriced market in the
country for real estate investment.
   Los Angeles finished second in the balloting for most overpriced
market, but also was identified as the metropolitan market likely to
produce the best real estate performance in the next five years.
   ``I think it reflects the fact that Los Angeles placed high in
every category,'' said Evans. ``It's just a feeling that the
Southern California economy doesn't want to stop.''
   Other top overall performers are expected to be Atlanta, Seattle,
Washington and Chicago.
   Other markets viewed as overpriced were Boston, chosen by 9.9
percent of the respondents; San Francisco, 7.5 percent; and
Washington, D.C, 5.6 percent.
   The survey also examined projected growth in specific property
sectors: apartments, warehouses, retail space, and central and
suburban office space.
   Prospects for building apartments are best in Los Angeles, the
specialists said. Atlanta is next, followed by Seattle, San Diego
and Washington.
   Atlanta topped the list of candidates for warehouse space,
followed by Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas-Fort Worth and Seattle.
   Seven of the top 20 projected retail markets are in California.
The specialists chose Orange County and Los Angeles as the best two
retail markets, followed by Atlanta, San Francisco and Seattle.
   Washington was rated as the best market for central and suburban
office space in the first half of the 1990s. Rounding out the top
five markets for office space in the central business district were
San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago and Seattle.
   Los Angeles was second in the voting for prospects for suburban
office space, followed by Orange County, Calif., Atlanta and New
York.

<HEAD>Energy Futures Rebound After Opening Sharply Lower</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices finished higher Wednesday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, rebounding from early losses.
   On other markets, grains and soybeans were mostly higher,
precious metals declined, and livestock and pork futures were mixed.
   Energy futures rallied after opening sharply lower in reaction to
inventory figures released after the close of trading Tuesday by the
American Petroleum Institute.
   The API report showed an increase of 2.5 million barrels in crude
oil stocks, a 2.3 million barrel increase in gasoline stocks and a
4.1 million barrel increase in distillates, which include heating
oil.
   But prices soon reversed course and began to rise. The feeling is
that all the bad news is out, and from the fundamental perspective,
little more could adversely affect the market, said Nauman Baraket,
an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   Andrew Lebow, an analyst with E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures
Inc. in New York, said the market was also helped by Tuesday's
announcement by the Saudis that they will stick to their oil
production quota set by OPEC in May.
   Kuwait also said it would stick to the production quota set by
the 13 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   Rumors of a possible nuclear power accident in the Soviet Union,
which would increase demand for crude oil and reduce Soviet exports,
also fueled the market, Lebow said.
   A mysterious cloud was first spotted over the Soviet Union on May
26 and was moving towards Finland, according to Vienna-based
International Atomic Energy Authority. An agency spokesman said
Wednesday the USSR had not informed them of any radioactivity in the
cloud.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 4 cents to 24 cents higher
with the contract for delivery in July at $16.92 a barrel; heating
oil was .12 cent to .29 cent higher with July at 47.31 cents a
gallon; unleaded gasoline was .40 cent to .56 cent higher with July
at 58.36 cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly higher on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   The market was heavily influenced by the reports of the cloud
heading towards Finland, said John Frazier, an analyst with Gerald
Inc. in Chicago.
   The reports triggered speculation about possible damage to
farmland in those areas that could mean stronger demand for U.S.
grains and soybeans.
   Also influencing the market was a weather outlook by a private
forecaster that calls for unusually hot, dry weather in the Midwest
in late July and early August. The heat is forecast for a period
when corn and soybeans mature.
   Soybean futures received a boost from strong cash markets for
soybeans, light selling by farmers and the continuing Brazilian port
shutdown.
   Wheat futures received some support from commercial and
speculative buying, although forecasts of warm weather that would
speed the harvesting of the winter wheat crop weighed on prices.
   Wheat was 2\ cents lower to a { cent higher July at $3.31{ a
bushel; corn was 1\ cents lower to 2} cents higher with July at
$2.79} a bushel; oats were unchanged to a { cent lower with July at
$1.46\ a bushel; soybeans were 1\ cents to 4 cents higher with July
at $5.94 a bushel.
   Precious metals futures declined on New York's Commodity Exchange.
   Craig Sloane, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in
New York, said the market tried to keep the positive tone seen in
Tuesday's trading but was unable to do so.
   ``The market is continuing a trend downward,'' he said. ``People
are not interested in the market. And there is nothing in the way of
news that is significant to the market.''
   Gold was $2.40 to $2.80 lower with June at $352.40 a troy ounce;
silver was 3.3 cents to 3.5 cents lower with June at $5.030 a troy
ounce.
   Livestock futures were higher and pork lower on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .07 cent to .37 cent higher with June at 75.22 a
pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .48 cent higher with August at
85.45 cents a pound; hogs were .98 cent lower to .05 cent higher
with June at 66.05 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.25 cent
lower to .37 cent higher with July at 66.05 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Pickens Uses Videotape to Appeal to Koito's Stockholders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's not exactly Michael Jackson's ``Thriller,''
but corporate raider T. Boone Pickens is turning to similar pop
technology to step up his battle for changes in a Japanese company _
he's done a video.
   In an 8-minute, 22-second videotape mailed this week to about
4,100 shareholders of Koito Manufacturing Ltd., Pickens appears on
horseback wearing a cowboy hat, playing racquetball and with his
family.
   Pickens claims that the company's unwillingness to seat him on
Koito's board of directors or make other changes that he wants is a
symbol of Japan's unwillingness to open its markets to foreign
competitors.
   In the video, in which he speaks under the voice of a Japanese
translator, the Texas oilman appeals for support on seven proposals
he is asking Koito shareholders to adopt at the auto parts
manufacturer's June 28 annual meeting.
   Finally, Pickens exhorts Koito shareholders to do their part to
change Japan's economic system, or ``your children will not find
opportunities to better their lives.''
   Pickens is Koito's largest shareholder with 26 percent of the
common stock. The company has rebuffed him for more than a year,
claiming he is after greenmail, in which a company pays a
shareholder a premium price to fend off a hostile takeover.
   The tone of the tape, produced at a cost of about $20,000,
resembles U.S. political television advertising.
   Pickens' assistant, Andrew Littlefair, conceded Wednesday that
the pitch had little chance of success because so-called stable
shareholders _ companies such as Toyota Motor Co., Nissan and
Matsushita Electric Products Co. _ control more than half of Koito's
outstanding stock.
   But ``it would seem to make a statement if a lot of the small,
individual shareholders vote with us,'' Littlefair said.
   Pickens claims he is being blocked by Toyota, Koito's
second-largest shareholder and largest customer. He also has
attempted to enlist the U.S. government in his fight, claiming he is
the victim of unfair and illegal barriers to foreign investment in
Japan.
   He complains that Koito, Toyota and other companies are members
of an automotive ``keiretsu,'' a business group that forces their
auto parts makers to sell them parts at artificially low prices.
   ``I have discovered something pretty disturbing,'' Pickens says
on the tape. ``The leadership of Koito is deliberately keeping us
out of the global marketplace and holding back financial returns to
stockholders.''
   ``If something isn't done to break down the practice of keiretsu,
things will never change,'' Pickens says. ``Your children will not
find opportunities to better their lives. Eventually, since the
marketplace is becoming increasingly global and competitive, they
may even fall behind.''
   Koito plans to respond with its own proxy statement next week, a
U.S. spokeswoman for the company said.
   ``It sounds like Pickens is using pressure tactics to coerce
Koito shareholders and disrupt Koito business,'' said a U.S.
spokeswoman for Koito.

   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher signed an
agreement with the Soviets on Wednesday to share information on food
processing.
   He said the agreement was a start toward expanding trade between
the two superpowers.
   ``We are the two largest industrialized nations in the world,''
said Mosbacher. ``We have one third of the world's GNP. But we do
only a tiny fraction of world trade. ... We have nowhere to go but
up.''
   The agreement Mosbacher signed with Vladilen Nikitin, the Soviet
agriculture minister, creates a team of U.S. and Soviet government
officials who will study the food processing systems of the two
countries and determine how U.S. technology and methods can be
incorporated into the Soviet system.
   A high proportion of Soviet food production has been reported to
spoil because of inefficient distribution, handling and storage
before it reaches the consumer.
   Nikitin said the agreement was a small step, ``but everything
starts with a small step.''
   ``For you, it's a key if you want to participate in the
strengthening of our economy,'' he said through an interpreter.
   The pact was signed on the last day of a three-day conference
sponsored by the Food Processing Machinery &amp; Supplies Association
and the National Food Processors Association.
   Fifty-five Soviet officials met with representatives of more than
50 food companies, administration and congressional officials
seeking deals that could lead to increased business for Americans
and modernization of food distribution for the Soviet Union.
   John Cady, president of the food processors association, said
barriers are beginning to come down, though Americans still are
concerned about getting paid for business with the Soviets.
   Soviet currency is of almost no value in the world market,
leaving those companies doing business in the Soviet Union to either
accept products in exchange or wait for long-term gains after the
economy there improves.
   ``We have to understand when companies invest, it's not going to
be a three-year turn-around, but probably eight to 10 years,'' said
Cady.

   About 200 workers were left without jobs when
the last bauxite mines in the United States were closed by the
Aluminum Company of America after 91 years of operation, the company
said Wednesday.
   The mines, located near Little Rock, Ark., are adjacent to
Alcoa's Arkansas Operations, which includes a bauxite refinery and
chemical facilities for processing alumina, an oxide of aluminum
present in bauxite.
   Some of the employees retired and others were laid off when the
mines closed last week. The refining operations also are being shut
down, Alcoa said.
   The mining and refining operations were ended because the
reserves of bauxite were no longer economical to mine and refine,
the company said.
   The bauxite was used to make about 275,000 metric tons of alumina
a year.
   Alumina once was used in the production of aluminum but recently
was used mostly to produce chemicals for cements, ceramics, fire
retardants, paper and pharmaceuticals, the company said.
   About 700 employees who will remain at the plant will make
chemicals from alumina feedstocks from other Alcoa locations, the
company said.
   The world's largest reserves of bauxite are in Australia, Brazil,
Guinea, Jamaica, Suriname and Venezuela.

   Energy futures prices regained some ground
Wednesday, aided by technical factors and rumors of a nuclear
accident in the Soviet Union.
   The July contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, rose 24 cents to $16.92 a 42-gallon barrel
on the New York Mercantile Exchange after having lost 82 cents over
the first two days of the week. Later months also rose Wednesday.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for July delivery, which plunged
nearly 3 cents over Monday and Tuesday, moved 0.54 cent higher to
58.36 cents a gallon Wednesday with subsequent months also advancing.
   And the July contract for home heating oil picked up 0.20 cent to
settle at 47.31 cents a gallon after skidding 1.62 cents earlier in
the week. Later months also advanced Wednesday.
   Analysts said the market opened lower, but rumors about a Soviet
nuclear disaster sent prices higher.
   The rumors were sparked by the appearance of a dark cloud sighted
over the western Soviet Union. Finnish authorities, who were
monitoring the cloud, said it could have been caused by some kind of
accident or it could just be an ordinary cloud.
   Traders bought up futures on the theory that if the cloud were
the result of a nuclear accident, the Soviets might need other
sources of energy.
   Technical buying throughout the day also boosted prices, the
analysts said.
   In natural gas trading, the July contract declined to $1.560 per
1,000 cubic feet from $1.567 on Tuesday.

   Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. plans to purchase
the $252 million credit card accounts and receivables of Midlantic
Corp., the companies said Wednesday.
   The premium on the sale is expected to be about $60 million,
Manufacturers Hanover said in a news release. The deal should be

regulatory clearance, the release said.
   Charles R. Walsh, head of Manufacturers Hanover retail card

in the credit card business. The holding company's portfolio of
credit card receivables after the sale will exeed $3.3 billion,
according to the release.
   The deal will continue Midlantic's restructuring efforts, said
Frank P. Garnevicus, executive vice president and treasurer.
   ``It will enable Midlantic to concentrate its efforts on its more
traditional lines of business,'' Garnevicus said.

for a credit squeeze in some regions.
   Senior federal banking officials conceded Wednesday before the

difficult for businesses to get loans, particularly for commercial
real estate projects.
   But they said that is mostly a justified response to a sluggish
economy rather than a reaction to intensified scrutiny from

   ``Greyhound refugees'' left in the dust by a
3-month-old strike of the only nationwide bus line are turning to
planes, trains and automobiles, and analysts say the survival of
coast-to-coast bus travel is in jeopardy.
   Greyhound has vowed to continue service with replacement drivers
while trying to reorganize its finances under bankruptcy las, but
many people are choosing alternate transportation.
   Some bus riders are paying more, finding it harder to make
connections and having to stay overnight where the pre-strike
Greyhound schedule allowed them to return the same day.
   Bus industry officials say they see little concern in Washington
over the state of interstate bus travel.
   ``I haven't received a single call from any legislator, mayor,
governor or anyone complaining about a lack of service because of
the Greyhound strike,'' said Wayne J. Smith, executive director of
the United Bus Operators of America.
   Jeremy Kahn, a Washington lawyer who represents scores of bus
lines, said bus travel is ignored because ``congressmen and
newspaper people don't ride the bus.''
   Most travelers affected by the strike are rural, poor or elderly,
he said. ``This is not a very vocal constituency.''
   Kahn said that whatever results from the strike and Monday's
bankruptcy filing, the Greyhound of the future will be considerably
scaled down.
   ``If Greyhound goes down, it probably will be virtually
impossible to go from coast to coast by bus,'' said John Sim,
another lawyer who has represented bus companies for 40 years.
   Greyhound says it's continuing to run buses to communities that
provided 98 percent of its revenue last year, but the use other
modes of transportation is increasing.
   Amtrak ridership is up 12 percent over last year, with increases
of 30 percent or more on some routes. Spokesman Cliff Black said
train travel was booming before the strike, but added, ``We have
gathered some Greyhound refugees and made them our own.''
   Car travel is expected to increase 2 percent this summer, said
American Automobile Association spokesman Geoffrey Sundstrom, but he
said it's impossible to tell how much of that, if any, will result
from the Greyhound strike.
   Airline travel is also up, and a summer fare war has made some
trips more affordable for people who might have taken the bus.
   Several small bus companies report increased ridership.
   More than a dozen bus lines have been granted new routes by the
Interstate Commerce Commission since the strike began.
   ``We were getting a fair share of the traveling public before the
strike,'' said Phil McBride of Peter Pan Bus Lines in Springfield,
Mass. ``Now we're getting the lion's share.''
   Jim Harmon, operations manager of Cascade Trailways in Tacoma,
Wash., said his line, which has daily runs to Sacramento, Calif.,
used some of its tour buses to serve Greyhound routes in the early
days of the strike.
   ``We backed out when they came back, because the market couldn't
support two of us,'' he said. But if Greyhound fails, Cascade is
ready to run buses to every town Greyhound serves in Washington, he
said.
   While Greyhound is the only bus system operating nationwide,
about 200 smaller lines run limited routes. Most of the other 1,800
lines carry tours and charters. Overall, it's a $12 billion industry.
   Charter lines that can charge more now that Greyhound has scaled
back its low-priced charter services also are benefiting from the
strike, said industry officials.
   But some bus companies say they are hurting, because Greyhound
does their ticketing and hasn't been turning over the revenue and
because the image of bus travel in general has been sullied by
violence during the Greyhound strike.
   Greyhound and police have reported more than 30 shooting
incidents involving buses or terminals since the strike began.
   In some areas, enterprising small businesses have replaced the
sleek Greyhounds with homey little passenger vans that make runs
like stagecoaches to isolated towns.
   ``When Greyhound stopped, the buses were able to keep running on
the freeways, but some of the little communities were without bus
service,'' said Lera Dwyer of Wichita Falls, Texas. ``And I've
always been service-oriented.''
   Mrs. Dwyer, who owns Skylark Transportation, said business for
her has quadrupled since the strike, with 10 small vans making daily
round trips to Paris, Texarkana, Abilene and stops along the way
abandoned by Greyhound.
   But even her company relies on Greyhound to make connections for
passengers and shipments of vital farm machinery parts, fresh
produce that has to arrive overnight, thread to keep a clothing
plant running and valuable bull semen.
   ``It would be a great blow if we lost Greyhound everywhere,''
Mrs. Dwyer said. ``An awful lot of people who cannot or would not
fly, I don't know how they would get around.''

   Edward Harshfield, the new head of
Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association, told shareholders bad business
judgment rather than government intervention wiped out their assets.
   Harshfield, who took over as chief executive three months ago,
did not mention predecessor Thomas Spiegel by name during his speech
at the annual shareholders' meeting on Tuesday.
   But he said executives of the thrift put the firm ``in harm's
way'' as far back as 1986, long before the collapse of the junk bond
market.
   Earnings slipped from $193 million in 1986 to $65 million in
1988, he said.
   ``The bottom line is that all but $17 million in stockholder
equity was wiped out, not by government action, but by the business
judgements and management actions over those several years,'' he
said.
   Columbia, which holds an extensive portfolio of the high-risk,
high-yield junk bonds, reported a $591 million loss in 1989.
   The firm must sell its junk bond portfolio, once valued at $3
billion, by 1994 to meet tough capital requirements imposed on the
thrift industry by Congress last year.
   ``Ed has been here for three months,'' Spiegel said after the
meeting. ``He has his perspective of the situation being here three
months. I have my perspective being here 13 years.''
   Spiegel resigned as chief executive on Dec. 31. He and his family
still own about two-thirds of Columbia's common stock.

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. on Wednesday
presented creditors with a bankruptcy reorganization plan that
promises to pay in full the debts of the collapsed Wall Street firm.
   Drexel attorneys said the plan envisions creating a separate
business entity out of Drexel's junk bond holdings and giving
creditors an interest equal to their claims.
   Creditors of the brokerage firm and about a dozen smaller
subsidiaries of parent Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. would be
paid in cash, Drexel attorney Alan B. Miller said. Creditors of the
parent and two commodities trading subsidiaries would receive
promissory notes.
   The plan also proposes creating a separate fund for settling more
than 400 outstanding lawsuits by investors who say they were
defrauded by trading activities by Drexel, whose admission to
securities felonies last year sped the firm's demise.
   The plan was announced by Drexel attorneys at a two-hour meeting
with about 100 creditors and their representatives and was not
formally entered into bankruptcy court. Drexel's parent filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection in February and its brokerage
subsidiary followed suit last week.
   Drexel has said it plans to emerge from bankruptcy court as an
operating entity on Wall Street, although it is unclear what shape
the firm would take.
   Under the reorganization, Drexel would create a separate business
entity out of its holdings. Creditors would receive promissory notes
valued at the amount of their individual claims and backed by
Drexel's assets, Miller said.
   Drexel says its holdings are worth about $2 billion, but a large
portion consists of junk bonds the firm has been unable to sell
because of their low quality and a severe downturn in the high-yield
bond market.
   The holdings also include so-called bridge loans, which are
temporary loans made to clients that remain unpaid, typically
because permanent financing has not been obtained.
   Miller said Drexel was confident ``there would be sufficient
backing in assets for all our constituents and hopefully value left
over for our equity shareholders.'' Drexel employees owned the
firm's stock, the value of which vanished when the firm collapsed.
   Barry Dichter, an attorney representing Banco de Portugal, one of
Drexel's largest creditors, said determining the value of the
holdings ``will be the great debating point in this case.''
   ``This is really the first step in what will be a lengthy
negotiation process,'' he said. ``Creditors will require a lot more
information than they now have in order to evaluate the concepts
that were put forward.''
   Under the proposal, creditors would be free to sell their notes
in the open market if they can find a buyer, giving them a way to
recoup cash for what they are owed, Drexel attorneys said. Drexel
would redeem a small portion of notes periodically or buy them back
if it had the money.
   It was left up in the air how and when Drexel planned to value
the assets in the unit. Creditors' lawyers said they presumed the
holdings would receive a value at the time Drexel files its
reorganization plan with the bankruptcy court.
   Drexel would manage the portfolio and be allowed to conduct other
business activities at the same time. But the composition of
Drexel's management after it emerges from bankruptcy is an open
topic for debate, Miller said.
   Drexel would seek to liquidate the junk bond holdings for maximum
value and recoup the outstanding bridge loans from former clients.
``We think you could return 80 percent of those bonds probably
within a two-year period,'' Miller said.
   Creditors' attorney have said they likely would oppose allowing
current management to be in charge.
   Another unresolved issue is some $260 million in bonuses that
Drexel paid to executives in the months before the bankruptcy filing.
   Drexel has requested a 120-day extension from a June 13 deadline
to file a reorganization plan in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. A spokesman
declined to discuss the plan and Drexel attorneys did not
immediately return calls seeking comment.
   The firm, which rose to power on Wall Street by dominating the
high-yield bond business, failed to recover from a government
securities fraud investigation. Drexel last year pleaded guilty to
six felonies and agreed to pay $650 million to settle insider
trading and other allegations.
   As of March 30, Drexel said it had total assets of $3.26 billion
and total liabilities of $2.8 billion.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Hands States Regulation of Enhanced Phone Services</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Wednesday gave
states the authority to regulate new telephone services such as
voice mail and computer access, a move one Baby Bell company said
could raise costs to consumers.
   The decision could force the seven regional Bell telephone
companies to set up separate corporate entities to handle their
regulated telephone services and their newer, unregulated services,
officials said.
   The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals opinion vacated a 1985 Federal
Communications Commission rule that had required the Baby Bells to
keep finances separate for regulated and unregulated services but
not create separate corporations. Seven lawsuits had been filed to
overturn the rule.
   The court's ruling allows each state to decide whether to require
separate corporations.
   The California Public Utilities Commission, which filed three of
the lawsuits against the FCC, heralded the decision. The plaintiffs
had contended that the Baby Bells could have subsidized unregulated
services by charging higher prices on regulated phone service.
   ``It properly gives the states greater freedom to promote the
development of enhanced services and the terms and conditions upon
which those services are provided,'' Commission President G.
Mitchell Wilk said.
   Steven Harris, director of planning and policy for Pacific Bell,
said the company supports state regulation but fears state control
could lead to a costly corporate division of regulated and
unregulated services.
   ``It's not clear that we are going to have to split off,'' Harris
said. ``It's up to the states. But we strongly believe that
independent subsidiaries are not necessary and would make it more
difficult to provide the services to the public.''
   An FCC spokeswoman said the opinion is a setback for the
communications industry.
   ``We adopted the rules because we believed they would be in the
public interest,'' said spokeswoman Jane Mago. ``So, of course,
we're disappointed in the outcome. We have to start from scratch.''
   Unregulated communications services have developed rapidly in the
past 10 years into a multi-billion-dollar industry that ranges from
voice and electronic mail to automatic teller machines, Harris said.
   The appeals court ordered the FCC to develop new rules to help
regulate new telecommunications services offered by the Baby Bell
companies.
   Those companies had been prevented from providing information
services under a court decree that stripped AT&amp;T of its local
operating companies in January 1984.
   Later that year, the FCC allowed the Baby Bells to offer
unregulated services through separate subsidiaries. But in 1985, the
federal agency dropped the requirement for separate subsidiares.
   The court said the FCC arbitrarily and capriciously reversed
itself without showing that cost-shifting between unregulated and
regulated services wouldn't occur and raise the bills of ``captive
telephone customers.''
   ``The record yields no evidence that the (Bell Operating
Companies) power to extract monopoly rents from local telephone
customers has diminished,'' the court said.

   Secretary of Transportation Samuel K. Skinner
said Wednesday that approval of a gasoline tax increase by
California voters validates the administration's argument that
states can and will raise their taxes to pay for highways and other
transportation needs.
   In a referendum on Tuesday, Californians voted to increase the
gasoline tax from 9 to 18 cents a gallon to finance a $15.5 billion
freeway construction program.
   ``I am delighted with that result,'' said Skinner, architect of
the administration's national transportation policy, which looks
largely to state and local financing to meet increasing needs.
   He told reporters the California vote shows that states are
willing to act to meet those costs, so long as the voters know where
their money is going.
   ``I think the best validation of that principle is the vote
yesterday in California,'' Skinner said.
   He said the average voter would say no to a gasoline tax increase
that wasn't earmarked for transportation, and yes to one
specifically targeted for roads, bridges and other infrastructure
needs.
   ``I think that's what happened in California,'' he said.
   Skinner said he assumed there would be discussion of increases in
the federal gasoline tax, currently 9 cents per gallon, during the
current negotiations on the federal budget and deficit. He said he
does not support or advocate an increase in that tax, but when and
if there is one, it also should be earmarked for the infrastructure.
   Asked to name other states he believes should follow the
California example, Skinner said 18 states have increased gas taxes
in the past year, and pointed to New York as one that has not.
   He said it should be considered there. ``I think it's a good
potential'' in a state with major infrastructure needs.

<TEXT>
   Armstrong World Industries Inc. and the
Belzberg family have dropped all lawsuits stemming from their
hostile takeover fight in a settlement that makes the Canadian
family $4.4 million richer.
   Under the agreement, which Armstrong announced Wednesday, the
Belzberg group will limit its holdings of Armstrong stock for a
period of 10 years to no more than 50,000 shares.
   The family, whose investment vehicle is First City Financial
Corp., agreed not to interfere in any business aspect of the
floor-covering company.
   ``We have entered into this agreement because it will put an end
to the many disruptions caused by the litigation, not to mention the
substantial expense,'' Armstrong spokesman John Scheldrup said.
   ``Now we can devote all our resources and energies to running the
business, which is certainly in the best interests of the
corporation,'' he said.
   Last week, First City Financial Corp. announced it would abandon
its bid to acquire the Lancaster company.
   The pullout came about a month after the Belzbergs failed to seat
three of four nominees on the Armstrong board and the state of
Pennsylvania enacted legislation requiring corporate raiders to
surrender short-term profits from thwarted takeover bids.
   First City said the takeover law and the largely unsuccessful
proxy fight played a role in the decision.
   The agreement calls for First City to pay Armstrong $605,000 and
for Armstrong to pay First City affiliates $5 million.
   The payments are in part reimbursement of First City's expenses
related to the proxy fight, Scheldrup said.
   In addition, the Belzbergs have agreed not to pursue their
petition proposing changes in Armstrong's articles of incorporation.
   The state's anti-takeover legislation was drafted last year after
the Belzbergs first disclosed an interest in acquiring the company.
In addition to garnishing raiders' profits, the law also restricts
the voting rights of raiders and preserves labor contracts when
corporations exchange hands.

<HEAD>Metromedia Awarded $46 Million in Lawsuit Against Fugazy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Metromedia Co. was awarded $46 million in damages
Wednesday in its civil racketeering lawsuit against William Fugazy,
an operator of travel agencies and limousine services.
   The lawsuit was over Metromedia's 1985 purchase of Fugazy Express
Inc. car service, which is now in bankruptcy proceedings.
   A six-member jury in U.S. District Court found that Fugazy had
misrepresented to Metromedia the company's financial condition and
certain liabilities.
   The jury awarded $15.6 million in damages, which under civil
racketeering statute is trebled to more than $46 million.
   Anthony Princi, Fugazy's attorney, said he would appeal.
   The lawsuit also named Fugazy's son, Roy, and two of Fugazy's
companies, but the jury rejected all charges against them.
   The trial lasted three weeks and included testimony from Fugazy
and billionaire John Kluge, who controls Metromedia.
   Metromedia is a privately held partnership that owns companies in
the telecommunications, software, restaurant and hotel industries.
It previously sold its television stations to the Fox network.
   The Fugazy family owns a chain of travel agencies and a separate
limousine service in New York.
   Metromedia attorney Martin Shelton said Fugazy had overstated the
value of Fugazy Express by $7 million to $8 million and had given
Metromedia inaccurate earnings figures.
   Shelton also said that Metromedia had invested about $30 million
in Fugazy Express.

   He was riding high in April, shot down in May.
Donald Trump's highly publicized financial woes have turned June
into open season on the tycoon, with columnists and cartoonists
lining up to kick the man while he's down.
   ``The Donald in disarray. Is this a great country or what?''
asked Tony Kornheiser of The Washington Post in a column headlined
``When Trump Went Thump.''
   ``It's a cash flow problem. A slump de Trump. From `Trump: The
Art of the Deal' to `Thump! My Life as a Shlemiel,''' the column
continued.
   Despite the mounting abuse, Trump maintained his silence
Wednesday while negotiations continued between the developer and his
creditors. ``We won't be making any statements today,'' said Trump
spokesman Dan Klores.
   His wife, Ivana, was talking Wednesday. She came to Trump's
defense, promising to stand by her estranged husband ``through thick
or thin and for better or worse.''
   Trump, in need of cash to pay off a reported $30 million debt on
June 15, could be forced to sell off some assets _ the Trump Shuttle
and the Taj Mahal casino have been mentioned _ to make the payment.
In April, Trump claimed he had no cash flow woes; last month, that
turned out to be untrue.
   The real estate magnate and casino operator has long been the
target of Trump-bashing, even when things were going well. Spy
magazine, which dubbed Trump ``the short-fingered vulgarian,''
mounts monthly attacks at him.
   But Trump's legal woes have stepped up the pace.
   ``At last, all of us who've so loved the game of kicking Donald
Trump while he's up will have the fiendish thrill of kicking Donald
Trump while he down,'' wrote New York Newsday columnist Robert Reno.
   A New York Post cartoon showed a bedraggled Donald panhandling
from inside the ``Trump Carton.''
   Others suggested The Donald might have trumped up his money
misfortunes to keep his estranged wife, Ivana, from getting too big
a piece of the pie in any divorce settlement.
   ``A Trump Stunt?'' asked the Daily News, which quoted an
anonymous Ivana pal as saying, ``He is just trying to convince Ivana
that he has no money, so she'll soften up and go easy on him.''
   Newsday raised the same possibility in an editorial titled ``Art
of the Fall?''
   ``After all, there's always the possibility The Donald has pulled
off the most artful deal of his career: Could it be an elaborate
scam to keep the Empire out of Ivana's hands?'' it asked.
   But in a statement issued through her lawyer, Michael Kennedy,
Mrs. Trump made it clear she plans to stand by her man.
   ``Donald and I are partners in marriage and in business. I will
stand beside him through thick or thin and for better or worse,''
said Ivana, who was not alone in refusing to kick Donald while he's
down.
   Strangely enough, ex-mayor Ed Koch _ a charter member of the
``Down With Donald'' movement _ declined to join the Trump-bashers.
While at City Hall, Koch constantly feuded with Trump and trashed
the multimillionaire developer as ``piggy, piggy, piggy.''
   ``I don't believe in kicking someone when they are down, so I
have nothing to say about Donald Trump,'' Koch said. ``Call me when
he's back on his feet.''

   Share prices rose on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
Thursday morning while the dollar dipped against the yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average gained 148.97 points, or 0.45
percent, ending the morning session at 33,102.47. The index rose
31.88 points the previous day.
   The dollar was changing hands at 152.46 yen at late morning, down
slightly from 152.49 yen at the opening and down from Wednesday's
152.60-yen finish. It ranged narrowly between 152.40 yen and 152.49
yen during morning trading.
   In bond dealings, the price of benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese
government bond inched up to 87.98 points from Wednesday's close of
87.89. The yield slipped to 6.94 percent from 6.99 percent.
   Arbitrage dealings supported the Nikkei index, stock traders
said. Thursday was the last day for transactions in June delivery
stock index futures and many participants bought stocks and sold
futures, said Akihiro Sezaki, a trader with Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru
Securities Co.
   Currency trading was very thin, said Chemical Bank dealer Chizuko
Satsukawa.
   ``Trading between major currencies, including the dollar and
mark, dollar and yen, and mark and yen were all stuck and would not
move, mainly because of a lack of market-affecting news,'' she said.

<HEAD>Banks Reportedly Sought Rule Relaxation on Real Estate Loans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commercial bankers have asked federal
regulators to bend capital rules to help them work out of problems
with troubled real estate loans, a newspaper reported.
   Bankers on the Federal Reserve Board's Advisory Council sought
help at a closed-door meeting on May 3 with the Fed's Board of
Governors, USA Today said in Wednesday's edition. The newspaper said
it obtained secret minutes of the meeting.
   The bankers suggested that the governors allow banks to take real
estate losses over a period of years, easing the squeeze on bank
earnings and allowing them more time to set aside reserves, the
newspaper said.
   They also suggested relaxing capital rules to allow banks to hold
and manage troubled real estate loans without a big increase in
capital, the newspaper said.
   One council member said the Fed governors did not respond to the
requests. ``Some members delivered the suggestion and the governors
listened intently,'' Ronald Steinhart, chairman of Team Bank,
Dallas, was quoted as saying.
   ``They're asking for forebearance. That's exactly what got the
savings and loans into trouble,'' said Lee Cross, spokeswoman for
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates the
nation's banks.
   William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,
said bankers have requested similar breaks from his agency. ``It
needs to be explored,'' he was quoted as saying, but he sees no need
for such breaks now.
   The 12 council members head some of the nation's biggest banks
and meet with the Fed governors four times a year. Fed spokesman
Joseph Coyne said minutes of the meetings usually are not released
publicly for three years.

<HEAD>FDIC Declines Unsolicited Offer for Its Holding of Continental Bank</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said it had
declined an unsolicited offer for its 26 percent stake of Chicago's
Continental Corp. _ a move that angered the bank's officials.
   FDIC spokesman Alan Whitney on Tuesday declined to reveal the
amount of the offer or the investors who made it except to say they
included the bank itself and certain members of its management. He
said the offer was made in the last several days.
   ``I'm dumbfounded that in a little more than six months, the FDIC
has passed up two legitimate offers to sell its minority interest in
Continental,'' Continental chairman Thomas C. Theobald said Tuesday.
`` Not only have they failed to turn their asset into cash, but
their continued ownership in a healthy bank is a wholly unwarranted
role for a regulator.''
   The FDIC became a shareholder of Continental after rescuing the
former Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co. in 1984. The
rescue was expected at the time to cost the federal agency $4.5
billion, but Continental's return to profitability has drastically
reduced estimates of the cost.
   In a brief announcement from Washington, the FDIC said it had
rejected the latest offer for its Continental holdings but still
remains committed to realizing full value for them. It said it would
explore all options for divesting its stake.
   Since the 1984 bailout, the FDIC has made three sales of its
Continental common stock, selling 12.5 million shares in November
1986; another 12.5 million shares in December 1988 and 9 million
shares in August 1989.
