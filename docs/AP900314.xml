   Gov. Gaston Caperton presented striking
teachers Tuesday night with a seven-point plan that promises no pay
raises, but calls for a special legislative session if there's
enough surplus money to fund a salary increase.
   Caperton also offered to call an ``education summit'' in May to
seek long-term solutions to the annual problem of teacher pay.
   Teacher union representatives left the governor's office without
comment about 10:45 p.m. Tuesday following a second day of talks.
   Gubernatorial spokesman G.C. Morse said the administration
expects an answer from the West Virginia Education Association and
the West Virginia Federation of Teachers by noon Wednesday.
   ``The immediate reaction from these folks was favorable, but
these folks need to get back and confer with whoever they confer
with,'' Morse said.
   The governor announced his offer in a statement at 11 p.m.
Tuesday. He took no questions from reporters.
   On March 5, when the Legislature was still in session, the
governor and legislative leaders offered the teachers a 5 percent
pay raise financed by a tax increase for coal producers, but that
deal collapsed the next day.
   Caperton said Tuesday night that he would not propose a tax
increase again because the public wouldn't support it.
   ``West Virginia simply cannot afford to do more,'' Caperton
said. ``No matter how jusitifed their position may be on the matter
of teacher compensation, I bear a responsibility to the taxpayers
of West Virginia.''
   More than 85 percent of West Virginia's 22,000 public
schoolteachers walked out in the state's first such strike last
Wednesday in a dispute over wages and benefits. By Tuesday, the
strike had spread to 46 of the state's 55 counties.
   The WVEA claims 16,000 members statewide, and the WVFT had
3,000, including teachers and other school employees.
   In addition to the special session proposal and the education
summit, the governor's proposal includes:
   _ An offer to work with teacher representatives to come up with
legislative proposals.
   _ $3 million from a school computer program to be diverted to
teacher pay.
   _ A promise to continue to work for equity funding, aimed at
equalizing teacher salaries statewide, including $20 million this
year.
   _ Full funding of the state health insurance program with no
deductibles or co-payments and without benefit reductions.
   _ Full funding of the Teachers Retirement System.
   Caperton called the meetings with the teacher representatives
``cordial and fruitful.''
   ``And, although we have not yet reached a final agreement on
returning teachers to the classrooms, we have closed the distance
between ourselves and that goal,'' Caperton said.
   Earlier in the day, Caperton postponed a speech on education
policy he was due to deliver Tuesday because of the continuing
discussions, his office said in a statement. The speech was
rescheduled for Wednesday night.
   Morse said at least part of the reason was because the governor
had very little sleep Monday night after holding talks for seven
hours.
   While the two sides gathered around a table in the governor's
conference room at the Capitol on Tuesday, teachers walked picket
lines at various places around the state.
   The state Department of Education said schools were closed
Tuesday in 25 counties, open in 19 and mixed in 11 others. The
number of teachers and students affected was not immediately
available, said education spokeswoman Carolyn Spangler.
   Teachers in Greenbrier County agreed Tuesday night to return to
work beginning Monday. The school board, which had threatened to
fire teachers who failed to report for work Wednesday, said it
would withdraw letters threatening the dismissals.
   In Jefferson County, teachers face fines and a contempt of court
citation if they don't return to work by Thursday. But the teachers
said they would ask the state Supreme Court on Wednesday to halt an
injunction ordering them back to work.
   Spangler said several counties have discussed seeking court
injunctions to limit pickets.
   The state's average teacher salary is $21,904, less than
teachers in every state except Arkansas and South Dakota, according
to the National Education Association.

   An Eastern Airlines DC-9 carrying 56 people left
the runway Tuesday night after being forced to return to the
airport by hydraulic problems, an airport spokesman said. No
injuries were reported.
   Eastern Airlines Flight 129 left the runway after the pilot
began having trouble steering, apparently because a tire blew, said
Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport spokesman John Braden.
   The plane, on a flight from Atlanata to Tallahassee, Fla. with
51 passengers and five crew members, returned to the airport around
10:50 p.m. because of hydraulic problems, Braden said.
   Witnesses reported seeing sparks from the aircraft as it glided
along the runway, but Braden said that was because the landing gear
was scraping the runway.
   He said the Federal Aviation Administration and the National
Transportation and Safety Board would investigate the incident.
   Passengers were given the option of taking another flight out
Tuesday night or waiting until Wednesday morning, he said.

   Jimmy Carter, the architect of the Camp
David peace accords, said Tuesday he doesn't expect the collapse of
Israel's government to ruin chances for a Palestinian-Israeli
dialogue and eventual peace in the Middle East.
   The former president said he hopes a single-party government
will emerge from Israel's political turmoil to avoid the ``timidity
and stalemate'' of coalition government.
   ``I do think there is still a good chance for ... dialogue,''
Carter said after a meeting with President Hosni Mubarak.
   ``The basic parameters have been worked out,'' he said.
``There's agreement among the Palestinians, the Egyptians, the
Americans and, I think, more than half the Israelis. So I believe
it's going to happen; it may be delayed to some degree.''
   Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir fired his Finance
Minister and political adversary, Shimon Peres. Ten ministers from
Peres' left-leaning Labor Party followed their leader out of the
Cabinet, and the tenuous political alliance that has ruled Israel
for six years collapsed.
   The government fell due to clashes over U.S. proposals for an
Israeli-Palestinian dialogue.
   Labor has accepted the idea of talking to Palestinian deportees
and Arab residents of Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem.
   But Likud opposes both ideas, saying they will lead to indirect
talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization and compromise
Israeli control over a united Jerusalem. Israel considers the PLO
to be a terrorist group and refuses to have a dialogue with it.
   Following Peres' dismissal and the mass resignation of his party
colleagues, Israel faces eventual elections.
   ``I'm no expert on Israeli politics, but I've always had the
feeling that a leadership of either Likud or Labor is better than
having a coalition government,'' Carter said.
   He said he was discouraged in May 1977 when Menachem Begin led
his Likud bloc to its first electoral victory since Israel's
statehood in 1948.
   ``I never believed that the Likud under him would move forward
in a courageous way toward peace,'' the former president said.
   But Begin later joined Carter and Egypt's former President Anwar
Sadat in signing the Camp David accords of 1978, which led a year
later to the first and only peace treaty between Israel and an Arab
nation.
   ``So I don't really think it matters one way or another which
party ultimately triumphs. Even if the Likud should triumph ... I
think this might bode better for a strong move towards peace than
to have a stalemated coalition government,'' Carter said.
   Carter is on a private four nation tour of the Middle East.
After leaving Egypt he is to visit Syria, Israel and Jordan.
   Since leaving office, Carter has visited the Middle East four
times to monitor peace efforts.

   Say goodbye to the Cold War and say hello
to love, Soviet style.
   With East-West differences crumbling like the Berlin Wall, a
U.S. housewife is warming up international relations with a dating
service that links prospective marriage partners from opposite
sides of the Iron Curtain.
   Marie Helbog is the founder and director of Scanna
International, a ``correspondence and introduction club'' which she
runs out of her suburban Rochester home.
   Helbog, a mother of four, started Scanna in 1980, 20 years after
she and her husband moved to the United States from Denmark. The
group's membership expanded from Scandinavians and Americans to
other nationalities.
   Following the rapid changes in Eastern Europe, Scanna arranged
for its first Soviet representative last fall.
   Already, Helbog has about 1,000 members in the Soviet Union, and
airmail envelopes from Russia with love pour in at a rate of about
150 a week.
   ``All these Russians,'' she said last week. ``We're so
overwhelmed.''
   Scanna also has a large number of Polish members and hopes to
begin placing ads and operating in Hungary and Czechoslovakia soon.
Letters have begun trickling in from would-be suitors in other
Eastern European countries who have seen Scanna ads in American
magazines.
   Scanna, which has about 3,000 members at any one time, also
matches pen pals, but most members are marriage-minded, Helbog said.
   Members fill out a questionnaire describing their interests and
personality and explaining what they're looking for in a partner.
In return, they receive photographs and profiles of prospective
matches.
   Fees range from about $20 for a choice of pen pals to about $90
for a selection of marriage partners.
   Scanna's American members, most of whom are men, have shown
great interest in Soviet and Polish women, apparently considering
them either more exotic or more domestic, Helbog said. ``They're
all checking that box off,'' she said.
   ``I like cleanliness and order. I cook wonderfully,'' writes
Olga Z., a 31-year-old Soviet teacher from Nakhodka seeking a man
with modern views. ``I would like to feel like a woman when I am
near him.''
   Olga K., a 28-year-old nutrition specialist from Vladivostok,
also in the Soviet Union, describes herself as elegant and refined,
looking for a strong-willed man who is aristocratic in character
and soul.
   ``It is good of you if you understand that attention,
admiration, care and compliments and flowers are of great
importance for women.''
   Helbog said recent changes have made it easy for Soviets who
marry Americans to leave the Soviet Union, something that a decade
ago would have meant months or years of red tape.
   She said she often receives letters and Christmas cards from
correspondents who have decided to tie the knot, but that it is too
soon to expect to hear from any East-West couples taking the plunge.
   Helbog employs one full-time staff member and three or four
part-time helpers in the United States. A bevy of agents and
affiliated groups run the overseas operations.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Lawyers to Identify Cash Clients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge issued a limited ruling Tuesday
backing the Internal Revenue Service's efforts to force lawyers to
identify clients who pay them more than $10,000 in cash.
   U.S. District Judge Vincent L. Broderick said two Manhattan law
firms must reveal the identities of five such clients, but stayed
his order so that attorneys Ronald Fischetti and Paul Goldberger
could appeal.
   He emphasized, however, that other lawyers could be exempt
because of ``special circumstances.''
   The judge said that as the law now stands, the issue must be
decided on a case-by-case basis. He urged the IRS and the U.S.
Justice Department to work with the defense bar to set up
guidelines for lawyers reporting cash income.
   At issue is a 1984 law that requires everyone in ``trade or
business'' to report cash receipts of more than $10,000 and the
source of the payments.
   Lawyers maintain that the law violates the attorney-client
privilege.
   Fischetti, Goldberger and their firms were the subjects of the
first civil lawsuits to be brought in an enforcement campaign
against lawyers by the IRS. Last week, the IRS sent summonses to 90
other attorneys demanding similar information.
   Both Fischetti and Goldberger, who have handled many organized
crime and drug cases, filled out the required forms but refused to
identify five clients who paid them more than $10,000 in 1986 and
1987.
   In his oral ruling, Broderick did not specify what special
circumstances could exempt lawyers from identifying clients on the
IRS forms.
   Neil Sonnett, a Miami lawyer who is president of the National
Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, said an exemption could be
made when an attorney is actively representing a client who is
under indictment.
   Sonnett said that in the cases of Fischetti and Goldberger,
their representation of the clients whose identities were being
sought had already concluded.

<HEAD>Joint Chiefs Believe NATO Can Win Conventional War, Aspin Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon believes the United States and
its allies could fight and hold off the Soviet Union in Europe
without using nuclear weapons, says the chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee.
   In an extraordinary step that drew immediate criticism from the
Defense Department, Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., discussed with
reporters a classified report by the Joint Chiefs of Staff on the
military ``net assessment.''
   ``We can defend conventionally in Europe,'' Aspin said shortly
after Maj. Gen. John D. Robinson publicly discussed with the
committee an unclassified version of the report.
   In a brief exchange with reporters, and later before television
cameras, Aspin lent significance to the report's omission of the
issue of when North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces would have
to resort to nuclear weapons or accept defeat.
   Previous net assessments included a discussion of this question,
he said.
   ``If an attack comes, NATO bends but it doesn't break. The
Warsaw Pact is able to attack and it gets a lot of territory but at
no point does it look like NATO can't contain the war,'' Aspin said
of the classified report's conclusion.
   The joint chiefs based that view on Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's announcement in December 1988 of unilateral troop
reductions and the U.S. intelligence community's conclusion last
year that the Soviet threat has lessened.
   Assuming a further positive influence from a U.S.-Soviet
agreement on reducing conventional forces _ a treaty not expected
until later this year _ ``at that point, they (the joint chiefs)
say we ought to be able to defend right at the forward line, the
forward base,'' Aspin said.
   The congressman took it one step further, taking into account
the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact and the drive for democracy
in Eastern Europe.
   ``I look at this net assessment and I say, we win. We can go the
other way. NATO wins, the good guys win,'' Aspin said.
   Defense Department spokesman Pete Williams said Aspin may
believe he is free to discuss classified information, but ``as an
employee of the executive branch, I'm not.''
   Williams said Defense Secretary Dick Cheney approved the net
assessment within the past two weeks and a declassified version of
the full report might be released early in April.
   Aspin argued that the changes cited in the report should be
reflected in Cheney's $292 billion defense budget for the fiscal
year beginning Oct. 1. But he said the spending blueprint
``accounted for none of these.''
   ``The defense budget is seriously out of date,'' Aspin said.
   The proposal calls for a nearly $1 billion increase in spending
on the Strategic Defense Initiative, $5.5 billion for the B-2
stealth bomber and funding for two land-based nuclear missile
systems.
   Cheney has argued that although the Soviets have cut their
conventional forces, they continue to upgrade their strategic
weapons.
   However, according to Aspin a section of the classified report
states that the Soviets' ``strategic change is incomplete and may
be reversible under some conceivable political and military
circumstances.''
   Earlier at the Armed Services Committee hearing, Gen. Robinson
said the number of days the West could count on for warning of an
all-out Soviet attack had increased. Previously, the United States
has estimated that it would have 14 days of warning.
   But based on last year's intelligence community assessment and
Soviet troop reductions, Robinson said that number can be
multiplied ``by a factor of four or five.''
   ``Post-CFE pushes it out further,'' Robinson said referring to
the proposed Conventional Forces in Europe treaty.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: White House May be Setting Trap for Democrats on
Taxes</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration may have enhanced
prospects for a watershed budget accord in its warm reaction to a
plan by Rep. Dan Rostenkowski. Or it may just have set a trap for
Democrats.
   Either way, the White House decision to sing praises of the
ambitious proposal by the Democratic chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee has congressional Democrats in disarray.
   By short-circuiting the budget process and responding to a plan
that no committee has yet voted upon, Bush mischievously managed to
put Democrats on the defensive and score points for a willingness
to negotiate.
   In fact, there is nothing on the table to negotiate at this time.
   Furthermore, the administration's assertions of disagreement
with some elements of the package _ its advocacy of a Social
Security freeze and tax increases _ make it sound like Democrats in
general have embraced such proposals.
   In fact, Rostenkowski thus far has mustered little Democratic
support for his plan. It is not before the House and Senate budget
committees, which under law must come up with their own
deficit-reduction plans by next month.
   The administration's stance enables it to claim credit for a
willingness to deal on tough budget-deficit issues, while making it
appear that Democrats have proposed what Republicans always accused
them of advocating: higher taxes and a desire to tamper with Social
Security.
   ``We're not trying to be cute on this,'' insists Richard G.
Darman, Bush's wily budget director, architect of this week's White
House maneuvering.
   Darman says he wants the administration's response to be taken
on its face: a hats off to Rostenkowski for putting together ``the
first serious proposal that has been put in the public domain by
Democrats.''
   Darman concedes that Rostenkowski's proposal is not a formal
Democratic plan. But, he told reporters Tuesday, the congressional
budget committees ``are not yet close to being able to put together
a budget resolution and it's important that there be something
there to negotiate with.''
   Many analysts do suggest that the administration's actions this
week _ whatever the motive _ could serve as the catalyst that might
lead to a long-elusive major budget compromise between the White
House and Congress.
   Such a wide-based bipartisan compromise might be the only way
that the administration could eventually sign off on a measure that
included tax increases.
   Bush seemed to point himself in this direction at a news
conference Tuesday when he was asked if he could assure Americans
there would be no tax increase this year as part of a
deficit-reduction package. ``I'm only one player,'' he said.
   He added that he has no plans to change his own views on taxes.
But that's still a lot milder than his ``Read my lips: no new
taxes'' of yore.
   Darman has a reputation as a spinner of carefully crafted webs.
In fact, ``Darmanesque'' has become a standard description in the
nation's capital for complicated and often vexing stratagems.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., has tried to play down
Bush's unexpected receptivity to Rostenkowski's plan, suggesting it
stems mainly from their personal friendship.
   ``That doesn't speak of any substantive change on the part of
the president to consider new taxes,'' Foley said.
   Rostenkowski's proposal would raise the tax rate on the
highest-income Americans from 28 percent to 33 percent and increase
excise taxes on gasoline, liquor and tobacco. It would impose a
one-year freeze on federal spending, including Social Security
benefits. And it would channel ``peace dividend'' defense savings
into further reducing the deficit.
   His plan envisions a balanced budget by 1994 and would replace
the current Gramm-Rudman law which calls for graduated
deficit-reduction steps.
   Foley asserted that winning approval for new taxes was
``politically and governmentally impossible without the prior
approval and support of the president, who has ... destroyed any
opportunity for a long-term deficit reduction by refusing to
consider such new revenues.''
   Earlier this year, the administration was caught off guard when
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., proposed a politically
appealing plan to reduce Social Security taxes.
   Moynihan forced the administration into the awkward political
posture of having to oppose conservative dogma and go on record in
opposition to a tax cut.
   Now, with its stance on the Rostenkowski proposal, the White
House has come full circle _ putting Democratic leaders in a
similarly embarrassing position.

<HEAD>Allied Objections Force Revamping of Plan to Monitor Soviet Arms
Cuts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States, yielding to the concerns of
Western European allies, will propose a plan this week to reduce
troops and non-nuclear weapons in Europe with a key monitoring
provision deleted, a senior Bush administration official says.
   The abandoned provision called for stationing monitors at
European ports and weapons factories to guard against violations of
the 23-nation treaty nearing completion in Vienna.
   But the official, who outlined the verification package on
condition of anonymity, said virtually all the allies objected
strenuously to Soviet monitors at their plants and ports.
   The revised Western proposal will be presented in Vienna as
negotiators for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the
Warsaw Pact hold their sixth round of talks on a treaty designed
for signing this year.
   Whether the goal is achieved could depend on how the Soviets
respond to the Western proposal. ``The ball is in their court,''
the U.S. official said.
   The emerging accord calls for sharp reductions in Soviet tanks
and artillery in Eastern and Central Europe and a ceiling of
195,000 Soviet troops in the region. There would be much smaller
cutbacks in U.S. tanks and troops.
   The United States could keep 195,000 soldiers and airmen in West
Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark and Luxembourg, and an
additional 30,000 in other NATO countries.
   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev want
the treaty to be ready for signing by the 16 NAT0 allies and the
seven Warsaw Pact countries at a 35-nation summit meeting before
the end of the year.
   But several issues remain unresolved. Most important among them
is a procedure to guard against cheating.
   The task involves policing the vast expanse of Europe _ from the
Ural Mountains in the Soviet Union to the Atlantic Ocean _ to make
sure the limits on tanks and armored personnel carriers,
antiaircraft artillery, airplanes, helicopters and troops are
honored.
   The official said a ``web'' of safeguards would be offered by
NATO negotiators in Vienna, including on-site inspection of U.S.
and Soviet troops and tank deployments.
   Information on non-nuclear armories would be exchanged by the
two alliances and then its accuracy checked by monitors who would
go to the military installations.
   The monitoring system would be supplemented by aerial
surveillance under President Bush`s ``Open Skies'' proposal as well
as a second system of overflights to check on suspicious
developments.
   And the two sides would have the right to demand to check out
suspicious movements of troops and equipment under a system of
``challenge inspections.''
   Agreement within NATO on these measures, and on a plan for
destroying excess tanks which also will be presented in Vienna this
week, would improve prospects for concluding the treaty.
   But, the official said, virtually all the NATO allies objected
to having ``the KGB standing there'' as Soviet or other Warsaw Pact
inspectors were stationed at weapons plants or checked the entry or
shipment of arms from European ports.
   That, he said, would reveal to the Soviets information about the
manufacture and delivery of Western arms that the allies wanted to
keep secret.
   The United States accepted a similar arrangement at American
plants and ports to police a 1988 treaty with the Soviet Union to
ban intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
   But when it came to intrusive inspection in Europe under the
conventional forces treaty, ``the allies felt the United States was
pushing them too hard on the right of manufacturers and their
national rights,'' the official said.
   He added: ``They were most insistent on these points ... That
set of proposals went absolutely nowhere in Europe.''
   Bush predicted last year that the treaty would be completed by
this spring at the latest, but that prediction has proven overly
optimistic.
   However, the official said 90 to 95 percent of the treaty is
completed.

<HEAD>Justice Department Seeks Quick Review of Flag-Burning Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court is likely to announce soon _
possibly Monday _ whether it will grant a Bush administration
request for speeded-up review of a new law making it a crime to
burn the American flag.
   The justices, in recess this week, will meet in a private
conference Friday to consider the request and could announce a
decision when they return to the bench.
   The Justice Department, while expressing doubts about the law's
constitutionality, filed legal papers with the court Tuesday urging
it to move rapidly and uphold the law.
   Department lawyers called for expedited consideration of the
politically charged issue, proposing oral arguments before the
court April 25 that would permit the justices to rule before the
current term ends in July.
   The department urged the high court to overturn rulings by two
judges, in Washington and in Seattle, who declared the law
unconstitutional.
   The judges ``overvalued ... the narrow category of expressive
conduct at stake and undervalued the compelling governmental
interest that lies at the core of the statute: the preservation of
the flag as the unique symbol of our nation,'' the department said.
   Conviction under the law carries a one-year jail sentence.
   The Justice Department acknowledged that President Bush allowed
the law to be enacted last Oct. 28 without his signature because he
questions its constitutionality and prefers a constitutional
amendment to assure the same protection for the flag.
   Bush said he has ``serious doubts (the law) can withstand
Supreme Court review'' and said ``a constitutional amendment is the
only way to ensure that our flag is protected from desecration.''
   A lawyer representing the defendants in both flag cases accused
the administration of seeking expedited Supreme Court review so
that the flag will be an issue in this year's campaign for House
and Senate seats.
   ``If the court issues its decision in July and it's in our
favor, there is no doubt a (constitutional) amendment will be
introduced'' in Congress, said David Cole, an attorney with the
Center for Constitutional Rights.
   Cole said he will ask the court not to consider the case until
October because ``this is a very important constitutional question.
It shouldn't be subject to political considerations.''
   The Supreme Court, voting 5-4 last June, struck down a Texas law
barring desecration or destruction of the flag. The court said
burning the American flag as a form of political protest is
protected by the Constitution's free speech guarantees.
   That case echoed themes from the 1988 presidential campaign in
which Bush stressed patriotic values and attacked his Democratic
opponent, Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, for vetoing state
legislation to require that public schoolteachers lead their
classes in the Pledge of Allegiance.
   The June Supreme Court decision touched off a political
firestorm and ultimately led to enactment of the new
flag-protection law.
   Democratic leaders in Congress supported the law as an
alternative to a constitutional amendment.
   In recent decisions, federal judges in Washington and in Seattle
dismissed criminal charges against defendants accused of flag
burning, saying the new law violated their free speech rights.
   In the Washington case, three demonstrators were arrested on
Oct. 30 after they set several flags on fire during a protest
outside the U.S. Capitol.
   Four demonstrators were charged with burning a flag outside a
Seattle post office the previous day.
   The Justice Department brief was signed by Solicitor General
Kenneth W. Starr, the administration's top courtroom attorney, and
other department lawyers.

   A fire killed a firefighter early today at a
government-funded corporation that works on nuclear technology, and
authorities said political extremists may have set the blaze.
   Koichi Fujita, a 24-year-old firefighter, suffocated while
battling the blaze on a basement floor of a nine-story building
housing the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corp., Tokyo
police reported.
   Police said the fire, which also destroyed three cars owned by
the corporation, may have been started by a time-ignition device
set off by extremists who oppose nuclear projects.
   A police official speaking on condition of anonymity said
investigators found batteries and other metal debris, apparently
used for the device, near the burned cars.
   The corporation, set up in 1967, handles the development of a
fast breeder reactor and of a recycling technology on spent nuclear
fuel.
   It is also handling the development of technology to store
nuclear waste at a facility under construction at a village in
Aomori, 360 miles, northeast of Tokyo. Radical groups have opposed
the project.

   Space shuttle Atlantis received a
warm welcome home after arriving atop a modified Boeing 747 at
Kennedy Space Center, the final stop on a coast-to-coast trip that
was interrupted by bad weather.
   ``After several delays, it's good to have the bird back in the
nest again,'' said NASA spokesman Bruce Buckingham.
   The jet touched down Tuesday near where Atlantis lifted off 13
days earlier on a secret mission to put a $500 million spy in orbit.
   Before landing, the jet flew about 5,000 feet over the beaches
south of Kennedy so spectators could see the shuttle riding
piggyback on the plane.
   Atlantis blasted off Feb. 28 after five delays, all but one
attributed to bad weather. Its trip back from Edwards Air Force
Base, Calif., to Kennedy also was plagued by uncooperative weather.
Rain can damage the shuttle's thermal tiles.
   The shuttle and jet completed the last leg of the trip home by
way of Columbus Air Force Base, Miss., where the craft arrived
Tuesday. The plane had been grounded since Sunday at Biggs Army
Airfield in Texas by bad weather.
   Buckingham said the delays would not affect Atlantis' next
flight, in July, another secret Pentagon mission.

<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 12 grafs to UPDATE with unofficial returns, Gairy

<DATELINE>ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sir Eric Gairy, the flamboyant
former prime minister, failed Tuesday in his comeback attempt in
Grenada's second election since the 1983 U.S.-led invasion,
complete but unofficial returns indicated.
   However, all four political parties opposing Gairy also failed
to gained a parliamentary majority, creating uncertainty over who
will lead the tiny Caribbean island's next government.
   With final but unofficial results in from all 15 parliamentary
constituencies, the National Democratic Congress of Nicholas
Brathwaite led with seven seats in the House of Representatives, or
parliament, one short of the necessary majority to form a
government, Radio Grenada reported.
   Gairy's Grenada United Labor Party won four seats, but Gairy
himself was defeated in his parliamentary district, the radio said,
citing the Electoral Commission.
   Gairy had dominated the island's politics for three decades
before he was ousted in a Marxist revolution 11 years ago.
   Radio Grenada said The National Party of acting Prime Minister
Ben Jones and the New National Party led by Keith Mitchell won two
seats each. Jones and Mitchell were both returned to parliament.
   The leftist Maurice Bishop Patriotic Movement failed to gain any
parliamentary seats.
   Radio Grenada said the results were complete but unofficial.
Official results were to be announced Wednesday.
   Although the outcome was inconclusive, Brathwaite, 65, a
moderate who led a 13-month interim government after the 1983
invasion, was in a strong position to become the next prime
minister.
   He said before the election that he would not be interested in
forming a coalition government, but most observers thought it
likely Brathwaite and Jones would merge their parties to form a
government.
   There was no immediate comment from any of the candidates.
   Turnout was estimated at 60 percent of the 58,296 eligible
voters, sharply below the 85 percent recorded in the 1984 election.
   The election happened to fall on the 11th anniversary of the
Marxist coup that toppled Gairy's authoritarian government on March
13, 1979, and brought to power the People's Revolutionary
Government of the late Prime Minister Maurice Bishop.
   A rift in Bishop's government led to his assassination, along
with 10 other people, on Oct. 19, 1983. Six days later, U.S.
Marines and paratroopers, along with a small regional force,
invaded the island and ousted a Marxist junta that had seized power.
   The Reagan administration, already alarmed by Bishop's close
ties with Cuba and the Soviet Union, said the invasion was
necessary to protect hundreds of medical students and prevent the
island from becoming a bastion of Communist aggression in the
region.
   Gairy, 68, and apparently nearly blind with glaucoma, earlier
said he would not contest the election unless a ``miracle''
improved his sight.
   Last month, however, he said ``a source greater than I''
ordained that he once again lead Grenada. He also said the election
came on the anniversary of his ouster not by coincidence but
because it had been ``arranged cosmically by a divine force.''
   Gairy, who was Grenada's first prime minister after independence
from Britain in 1974, was widely regarded as repressive and
corrupt. As early as 1961, Britain dissolved Gairy's
pre-independence government because of alleged financial
irregularities.
   Gairy's party won 36 percent of the vote in the 1984 election
but gained only one seat, which it later lost in a party defection.
The merged New National Party won 14 seats, with 58.5 percent of
the vote, but later split into three groups.
   The election followed the death of conservative Prime Minister
Herbert Blaize in December.

<HEAD>Study Finds Fat Arrives Between Ages of 25 and 34</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Young adults face the greatest risk of becoming
fat, and black women are especially vulnerable, according to a
decade-long study of nearly 10,000 people from age 24 to 74.
   Women of both races were twice as likely as men to gain a lot of
weight, and women from 25 to 44 years who began the study
overweight gained the most weight of all subjects, researchers
found.
   Among both sexes, those ages 25 to 34 were most likely to
experience a major weight gain, according to the study in this
month's Archives of Internal Medicine, published by the
Chicago-based American Medical Association.
   The findings ``suggest that among adults, those in their 20s
should be in the primary target group for obesity prevention
efforts,'' said the study led by epidemiologist David Williamson of
the nutrition division at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta.
   Prevention, rather than treatment, is the key because so many
people have trouble losing weight, Williamson said by telephone
Tuesday.
   He recommends ``just regular sensible exercise, like walking,''
and eating a diet low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables.
   Williamson noted that while women may be more likely to gain
weight than men, previous research has found that men face a
greater risk of developing weight-related problems such as heart
disease and diabetes.
   Women tend to carry excess weight in the buttocks and hips,
while men's extra poundage usually is concentrated in the stomach
area, nearer the heart and other vital organs and thus more likely
to cause problems, he said.
   Among women 25- to 34-years-old, blacks were 40 percent more
likely than whites to gain a lot of weight, Williamson's study
found. For women from 35 to 44, blacks were 80 percent more likely
to face a major weight gain, the researchers found.
   As many as one-third of the 9,862 subjects were overweight when
the study began. They were measured once between 1971 and 1975, and
again between 1981 and 1984.
   Women ages 25 to 44 years who began the study overweight gained
the most weight of all subjects.
   Researchers defined a major weight gain as an increase of about
20 percent, or an estimated 30 pounds for a person of average
height.
   Among all women ages 25 to 44 who were overweight at the start,
14.2 percent experienced a major weight gain, compared with 5.6
percent among men of the same age.
   Among women of that age group who were of normal weight when the
monitoring began, 6.2 percent gained a lot of weight, compared with
2.9 percent among men.
   After age 55, weight levels in men and women studied began
declining.
   The researchers did not attempt to explain the weight-gain
differences among women, men and blacks, Williamson said.
   ``Factors related to the excess risk of major weight gain that
may be different in men and women include childbearing, diet,
physical activity, and patterns of morbidity and mortality,'' the
researchers wrote.
   But they added, ``The question of why women in the United States
are at substantially greater risk of major weight gain during
adulthood than men warrants further study.''
   Although women tend to live longer than men, they also tend to
suffer more illnesses, which can affect activity and eating levels,
Williamson said.
   Black men were not studied individually because too few of them
participated in the study, he said.

   Vice President Dan Quayle's visit to
Paraguay brought his family two new members _ a pair of jaguars
named Chaco and Paloma.
   But the two young ones won't ever live in the vice president's
official Washington residence.
   Quayle and his wife Marilyn were presented with the pair of
5-month-old jaguars by President Andres Rodriguez. The cats are
native to Paraguay.
   Quayle said he would give them to a zoo in the United States.
   The animals seemed tame and cuddly as the Quayles played with
them on the lawn at the home of U.S. Ambassador Timothy Towell.
Quayle didn't get scratched but noted that their claws were very
sharp.
   The vice president's traveling press corps didn't have the same
luck.
   A radio reporter ended up with a two-inch scratch on his wrist
when one of the cubs caught a claw on his ring and drew blood
trying to free itself.

   In case anyone wondered what reading material shaped Quayle as a
youth, the answer is in.
   Like many kids of his generation, the 43-year-old Quayle
disclosed Tuesday, he grew up on the children's newsletter, Weekly
Reader.
   The subject came up after he planted a palm tree to mark his
visit to Paraguay, the first such trip by an American of his rank
in 32 years.
   The last visit was by then-Vice President Richard Nixon, Quayle
recalled.
   ``I was 11 then. I remember reading it in Weekly Reader _ how
Vice President Nixon planted a tree here. I always wanted to do
that,'' Quayle told reporters. ``It's true,'' he added, laughing.
   Maybe his tree will fare better than Nixon's.
   ``It's dying,'' an embassy aide confided.

   Quayle had some hindsight impressions a day after his Monday
meeting with Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega _ the man
conservative Republicans like Quayle have loved to hate for years.
   Meeting him face to face _ and talking over a 1{-hour lunch in
Santiago, Chile _ Quayle came away with the observation that
Ortega, defeated in the Feb. 25 election, was ``very cordial, very
polite.''
   He added, ``He knows what he's doing. His conversation was very
direct.''
   For perspective, the vice president sought the opinion of his
State Department translator, Stephanie Van Reigersberg, who has
been in several meetings with Ortega over the years.
   ``She felt there was a new sense of sincerity about Ortega,''
Quayle said. He said his talk with the Nicaraguan was ``extremely
positive.''
   However, Quayle quickly added, ``This is just one meeting'' and
everything can't be known from only one encounter.

   When dignitaries travel to foreign countries, exchange of gifts
with hosts is in line with protocol.
   That Quayle ended up with an empty gift box in Buenos Aires,
Argentina, was not meant as a slight, he was told.
   He got it Tuesday when he visited a tall ship that had
participated in the U.S. bicentennial regatta in New York.
   The captain of the Libertad, Alberto Valerio Pico, welcomed him
aboard, showed him around the 27-sail frigate and said he had
learned only that day that Quayle would stop by.
   Thus, he said, he had no time to get an appropriate gift.
Instead he gave Quayle a gift-wrapped box.
   It was empty, Pico explained, adding, ``We haven't had time to
fill it with the respect a vice president deserves.''
   He said he would fill it when his ship sails to Baltimore in
July.
   Quayle answered, ``I promise I won't open it till then.''

<TEXT>
   At least a dozen tornadoes Tuesday battered
south-central Kansas, killing a 6-year-old boy and another person,
injuring 14 others and extensively damaging more than 100 homes,
authorities said.
   Tornadoes also blew through sections of Iowa, Oklahoma and
Nebraska, causing widespread property damage, but no serious
injuries, authorities said.
   In Hesston, authorities were searching for two missing people.
   The town of about 3,000 poeple ``took a direct hit and there is
major damage,'' said a dispatcher with the Kansas Highway Patrol in
Wichita.
   Gov. Mike Hayden traveled to Hesston, which was left without
electricity.
   About 40 percent to 50 percent of the town sustained major
damage from the tornado, and debris was strewn everywhere, said
Phillip Kloster, manager of the nearby town of Newton who was
helping at the command post in Hesston.
   Thirteen people hurt in the Kansas twisters were taken to the
Newton Medical Center, about eight miles south of Hesston, said
spokeswoman Chris McKellip. Most had scratches, cuts and bruises.
   A 56-year-old woman who'd been traveling through Hesston when
the twister struck was treated for a broken arm at Wesley Medical
Center in Wichita, said a hospital spokeswoman.
   A dozen tornadoes touched down within a wide area of
south-central Kanas after 4:30 p.m., and continued into the
evening, said Highway Patrol Trooper Martin Berneking.
   ``We have approximately between 75 and 100 homes that have been
anywhere from completely destroyed to fairly seriously damaged,''
said Hesston city administrator Jay Wieland. At least five
businesses were destroyed and 15 were damaged.
   ``Surprisingly, we have very few people at this point who are
reported missing,'' Wieland said. ``We have temporary housing set
up at the high school and at the college. We have National Guard on
their way in now to help secure the area.''
   About 50 people went to Hesston High School's gym to spend the
night, said Principal Marvin Estes.
   The 6-year-old boy died at a home south of Burrton, which is
about 15 miles southwest of Hesston, when a chimney and fireplace
collapsed into a basement, said Harvey County Sheriff's
Investigator Byron Motter. Another child suffered minor head wounds
in the basement, where seven people had sought shelter from the
storm.
   Another person died in a home near the small town of Goessel,
which is about 10 miles northwest of Hesston, said Marion County
Sheriff Ed Davies. The victim's name was not released.
   In Hesston, the home of Charla Buscher, 14, was seriously
damaged by the twister.
   ``We're all really shook up,'' said Charla. ``A lot of the
houses here are leveled ... We had a car wash. It's gone.
   ``The northwest corner of Hesston is just, it's gone,'' she
said. ``There's nothing left. It just looks like as if it's just
starting construction''
   At a Pizza Hut, about 15 customers and employees took cover from
the storm in a walk-in freezer and two bathrooms, ``the two safest
places in the building,'' said restaurant supervisor John Anderson.
The storm tore the roof off the restaurant, but no one was injured.
   ``I was outside and I heard it roaring,'' said Dennis Eck, an
employee at a gas station, ``I flipped switches and we hit the
deck. The pumps are all torn up. We've got roof damage.''
   Eck said businesses north of his service station were
demolished, and that the post office suffered extensive damage.
   Civil Defense workers were on the scene. Initial reports said
the worst damage in Hesston was on the western edge of town.
   Wieland said power would be restored in a day and a half to two
days, and that emergency repairs were being made to water service.
   In the small eastern Iowa town of Worthington, a tornado
destroyed the fire house, 10 homes and three businesses, disaster
officials said. Fifty residents left homeless sought shelter with
the Red Cross.
   About 10 miles southwest of Worthingin, a twister leveled at
least three houses and damaged 13 farms, said Disaster Services
Director Dianne De Sotel.
   ``People were spotting them everywhere,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Federal safety officials are calling for 6,000
New York City subway cars to be equipped with speedometers, after
finding that some were going 15 miles per hour faster than the
operators thought.
   The recommendation came in a National Transportation Safety
Board meeting Tuesday on a crash in which a train carrying
passengers bumped into a fare-collection train at the 103rd Street
station in uptown Manhattan on March 10, 1989. Forty people were
injured, one seriously.
   Older subway systems in New York, Boston and Philadelphia are
the only ones in the country without speed indicators on the cars,
said the board's senior rail accident investigator, William Pugh.
   More modern systems are controlled by computers that
automatically report and control train speed and keep trains spaced
apart.
   The NTSB voted 4-0 to blame the crash on the unauthorized use of
a jumper cable that caused signal lights in the station to
malfunction. A light had indicated the station was clear of trains,
investigators said.
   The board said the fact the train was going faster than the
posted 18 mph contributed to the seriousness of the crash. But it
did not blame the operator for the excessive speed, saying the New
York City Transit Authority failed to ``furnish a reasonable means
for operators to determine speed.''
   Damage from the crash totaled $360,000.
   Pugh said checks of New York subways with radar guns found that
operators usually underestimated their speed, often by as much as
15 mph.
   He estimated that retrofitting all of New York's cars with
speedometers would cost about $6 million. Equipping new cars as
they are added to the system would cost less.
   Upgrading the 450-mile system with computer controls that
operate most of the nation's subway system would cost more than $1
billion, Pugh said.
   Board member Jim Burnett suggested cars might also be equipped
with recorders to aid transit officials and investigators in
determining the speed of cars. But the board elected to ask for
installation of speed indicators first.
   The safety panel recommended a change in the design of the
operator cabin door. It said the operator was trapped inside and
had to be pulled out through a window.
   It also called for the transit authority to develop a procedure
for notifying train operators when an unscheduled train is placed
in front of them. Schedules of fare collection trains, which travel
from station to station to pick up cash, are not posted for
security reasons, investigators said.

<HEAD>House Panel Votes Immunity for Ex-HUD Official in Pierce Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A motion granting a former top housing
official immunity to testify about ex-HUD Secretary Samuel R.
Pierce Jr. is going to a federal court following unanimous approval
by a House panel.
   The House Government Operations Committee voted 35-0 on Tuesday
to approve a motion to compel the testimony of Dubois Gilliam, now
serving an 18-month federal prison sentence for a HUD-related
conviction.
   Gilliam is expected to testify in late April or early May before
the Government Operations housing subcommittee, which has been
investigating scandals at the Department of Housing and Urban
Development during Pierce's tenure in the Reagan administration.
   Gilliam, formerly deputy assistant secretary of HUD and a top
aide to Pierce, has been cooperating with the committee.
   A special prosecutor, Arlin Adams, is looking into allegations
of fraud and influence-peddling in one of the HUD programs.
   Subcommittee chairman Tom Lantos, D-Calif., said the federal
court's approval is automatic but may take 30 days. The immunity
would mean Gilliam could not be prosecuted based on his truthful
testimony before Congress or information derived from that
testimony.
   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, meanwhile, defended the Bush
administration's proposed housing legislation as ``serious and
responsible'' under critical questioning from Democrats in an
appearance before the House Banking Committee.
   Kemp has labeled his housing proposal ``HOPE,'' for home
ownership and opportunity for people everywhere. Its centerpiece is
Kemp's plan for encouraging home ownership among low- and
moderate-income families.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., called the proposal ``more hype
than hope'' and ``long on words and short on action.'' Rep. Joseph
Kennedy, D-Mass., said the administration's housing budget is
``woefully inadequate,'' and that by failing to provide new
subsidized housing it would ``allow and condone homelessness.''

<HEAD>Mayor Says Political Support is `Still Intact'</HEAD>

   Mayor Marion Barry is refusing to answer
questions about the cocaine possession and perjury charges he
faces, but says his political support is ``still intact'' and
promises to announce soon whether he will seek re-election.
   Barry, who returned to the nation's capital Tuesday after six
weeks of substance abuse treatment, said he has no plans to resign
but stopped short of announcing that he will run for a fourth term.
   ``I'm not going to announce any decisions today,'' Barry said as
supporters chanted ``Four more years.''
   ``My political organization is still intact, despite some
defections ... we will announce some plans in the very near
future,'' he said.
   Barry entered a Florida substance abuse treatment center three
days after his Jan. 18 arrest on a cocaine possession charge, and
enrolled in a South Carolina treatment program on Feb. 22. During
his absence, a federal grand jury returned the indictments.
   He said Tuesday that he was suffering from alcoholism and from
addiction to Valium and Xanax, two anti-anxiety prescription drugs.
   Top aides have said privately that Barry also was suffering from
a problem with cocaine.
   The Democratic mayor's return to the nation's capital resembled
a campaign speech in a number of ways. The address was given in a
downtown municipal building packed with city employees who
repeatedly interrupted Barry's address with cheering.
   Barry gave a generally upbeat speech in which he stressed his
continuing recovery from substance abuse and desire to serve the
city. However, he refused to comment on the eight-count criminal
indictment, except for a confident prediction that ``the truth will
come out in the trial.''
   The indictment was returned on Feb. 15, nearly a month after the
FBI videotaped Barry allegedly smoking crack cocaine in a downtown
hotel room with a female friend.
   Barry's remaining supporters were taking a wait-and-see attitude
toward a possible re-election campaign.
   ``We're supposed to meet in the next couple of days to hear what
his decision is,'' said fund-raiser Jeffrey Gildenhorn. ``He did
come across as very sincere, very candid and very human, but I'd
have to see what kind of a platform he would have before I decided
to get behind him.''
   Gildenhorn will host a $100-per-plate breakfast for Barry's
legal defense fund on Sunday. Other supporters have defected,
however.
   Barry's former financial co-chairman is now a spokesman for the
mayoral bid by Walter Fauntroy, the district's nonvoting delegate
to Congress. Other supporters have distanced themselves, while some
politicians have called for the Democratic mayor to resign.
   During his statement, Barry said his faith in God and the love
of supporters and family members had seen him through his substance
abuse treatment.
   ``To those persons, I am eternally grateful, moved and
humbled,'' Barry said. ``I'm back and I feel good about my
treatment program. I feel good about myself, about my wife, my son,
and about the people of Washington.''
   The mayor declined to discuss the five cocaine possession counts
and three perjury charges filed against him, referring all
questions to his attorney, R. Kenneth Mundy.
   Barry blamed his drug problems on ``repressed anger as well as
prolonged and overwhelming stress'' created by his job.
   ``I had no idea of the depths of my problem,'' Barry said. ``For
a long time, I had known there was something very wrong and I no
longer felt good about myself. But I did not want to face the
extent of that problem.''
   The mayor said top aides, including City Administrator Carol
Thompson, would continue managing district affairs while he seeks
after-care. However, he said he will gradually resume his duties.

<HEAD>Scores of Demonstrators Arrested in Push for Rights Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House committee took this year's first
significant action on a major civil rights bill for disabled
Americans on the same day that scores of protesters demanding its
immediate enactment were arrested and carted off in their
wheelchairs.
   ``It is a priority for passage in this session of the
Congress,'' House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., told unpacified
demonstrators Tuesday inside the Capitol.
   The Energy and Commerce Committee, meantime, approved the
Americans With Disabilities Act by a 40-3 vote after amending it to
soften the impact on Amtrak and make other minor changes.
   Police arrested 104 people, many of whom had chained their
wheelchairs together, after deliberate acts of civil disobedience
following a confrontation in the Capitol Rotunda with Foley and
House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel, R-Ill.
   ``I am absolutely satisfied it will reach the floor, we will
have a conference with the Senate and it will become law,'' Foley
told the demonstrators. ``Will it be on the floor in 24 hours? No.''
   Protesters demanding that the bill be passed within one day
greeted that remark with boos.
   Advocates say that further delays leave the bill vulnerable to
``killer amendments,'' such as one that would exempt small
businesses from requirements to accommodate people with handicaps.
   The compromise between disabilities activists and the Amtrak
passenger railroad was the first House committee vote on the bill
this year. The Education and Labor Committee approved the bill last
November by a vote of 35-0. The Senate, where one committee had
jurisdiction, passed the bill last September by a 76-8 vote.
   Full hearings are expected later this month by both the House
Judiciary and Public Works and Transportation committees, meaning
the landmark legislation could become law this spring.
   The pace of the bill through Congress has slowed considerably
since last fall, when supporters predicted President Bush would
receive a bill by Christmas.
   The bill would guaranteed the rights of America's disabled
population, estimated to be at least 43 million, to employment,
phone service, and public and private accommodations such as
restaurants, shops and shopping malls.
   Members of the small business community say the bill imposes an
unfair and costly burden on them at the same time it sets
ill-defined standards that will lead to endless litigation.
   Supporters point to the enthusiastic support of the White House
and say the Senate version carefully phases in the requirements
while exempting the smallest businesses from its employment
provisions.
   Recent statements by the Justice Department have raised
questions about White House commitment to the bill because of its
relationship to other civil rights legislation that the White House
opposes.
   Those questions, combined with delays in moving the bill through
Congress, gave rise to a peaceful demonstration Monday outside the
Capitol and the more boisterous one Tuesday.
   Capitol Police spokesman G.T. Nevitt said the protesters face
possible sentences of up to six months in jail on each of the
charges against them: unlawful entry and demonstrating inside the
Capitol. The first charge has a maximum fine of $100, and the
second, $500.
   All were being held while an attorney negotiated for their
release, Nevitt said.

<HEAD>Army Commander Endorses Defense Against Rogue Missile Attack</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the Army's Star Wars
antimissile research endorses the idea of building a limited
U.S.-based defense against an accidental or rogue launch of Soviet
nuclear missiles.
   ``We're very interested in it here,'' said Gen. Robert D.
Hammond, commander of the Strategic Defense Command, whose
antimissile work accounts for about one-third of the Pentagon's
total effort to develop a defense against globe-circling ballistic
missiles.
   Many members of Congress, including Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, have advocated a
limited Star Wars defense that could protect against an accidental
or unauthorized Soviet missile launch. The Pentagon has been cool
to the idea, and the Bush administration has not officially
endorsed it.
   Supporters of the Strategic Defense Initiative, the formal name
for Star Wars, fear that emphasis on a limited protection system
would turn the nation away from former President Reagan's grander
original vision announced seven years ago of building a space-based
defense against a full-scale Soviet attack.
   A defense against accidental missile launches would be almost
totally land-based.
   In a wide-ranging interview with a group of reporters visiting
the Army's Advanced Research Center, where SDI work is conducted,
Hammond said he liked the idea of a limited defense because it
would use weapons and tracking systems already under development by
the Army. The Air Force is in charge of most space-based elements
of Star Wars research.
   ``We've done considerable planning and analysis of what might be
involved if a decision were made to deploy it; there has been no
such decision,'' Hammond said.
   The main feature of a limited system would be ground-based
interceptor rockets designed to destroy incoming ballistic missiles
before they re-enter the Earth's atmosphere. One hundred such
rockets could be deployed at a single U.S. site without violating
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.
   James C. Katechis, manager of the Army's land-based interceptor
program, said the first flight test is scheduled for this summer.
He declined to give an exact date.
   Other officials at the Army Research Center repeatedly
discouraged reporters from inquiring about a limited missile
defense. William Congo, an Army public affairs officer, said a
series of briefings for reporters was deliberately designed not to
focus on the subject.
   Asked why, Congo said, ``Because it's not a program'' _ meaning
the limited defense idea does not have official Defense Department
backing.
   Hammond stressed that he believed an accidental
launch-protection system should not be the final goal of the
Pentagon's missile defense research.
   He said it should be capable of being expanded to add
space-based elements that would give broader protection against
missiles.
   Even so, Hammond appeared to cast doubt on whether Congress ever
will approve a grander Star Wars system. ``I don't know if a
decision ever is going to be made to deploy a full-up'' strategic
defense as advocated by President Bush, he said.
   In earlier comments, Hammond was more upbeat about the outlook
for Star Wars. He said that despite recent cutbacks in SDI
spending, Bush still should be able to make a decision soon on
whether to move from research, development and testing to actual
deployment.
   ``I believe easily within the next three years a decision could
be made on deployment; yes, or no, are you going to put up a
defense,'' Hammond said.
   He added, however, that the timetable would slip if Congress did
not approve at least a modest increase in financing beyond the $3.6
billion allocated for the current fiscal year. Bush has requested
about $4.5 billion for the 1991 budget.

   The Environmental Protection Agency would
become the Department of the Environment under legislation approved
by the House Government Operations Committee.
   Similar legislation elevating the EPA to Cabinet status has been
approved by a Senate committee.
   President Bush wants Congress to pass the legislation in the
coming weeks so that an announcement on creating a Cabinet-level
department for environmental issues can be made in time for the
celebration of Earth Day on April 22.
   The legislation, which passed the House committee on a voice
vote Tuesday, has widespread bipartisan support in both the House

   Supporters of the House and Senate bills argue that creating a
Department of the Environment will put the EPA on equal standing
with other agencies and departments in government and give the
president's chief environmental adviser more prestige when dealing

<HEAD>Drug Official Sees New Threat: Heroin Smoking</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Increased imports of high-purity heroin have
encouraged a new variant _ smoking heroin _ among American drug
addictions, said David L. Westrate, in charge of operations at the
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
   ``I don't want to give the impression that it's widespread,'' he
said. ``We've seen some evidence over the past year in San
Francisco and New York.''
   American addicts have generally injected the heroin into a vein
in liquid form, with a hypodermic needle. In other countries,
heroin is more widely smoked, like the opium from which it comes.
   Westrate pointed to the increased fear among addicts of infected
needles. The use of a dirty needle by several addicts is one of the
most important ways in which AIDS has been spread. He also noted
that many drug users in this country have become used to smoking
crack, a potent form of the cocaine derived from coca leaf and
grown largely in Latin America.
   ``They get such a stimulus from the crack, that they need to
come down with a depressant _ heroin,'' he told a task force on
narcotics set up by the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
   In a brief interview after the hearing on Tuesday he explained
that a comparatively weak solution of heroin can be injected, but
the human body will tolerate much purer heroin when it is smoked.

   Former federal appeals judge Robert H. Bork
will begin teaching at the Arlington Campus of The George Mason
University of Law, school officials announced.
   Bork, whose nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court was rejected by
the Senate in 1987, will teach one class of constitutional law each
semester to about 40 second- and third-year students, school
officials said Tuesday.
   ``The circumstances were right. We grabbed the opportunity,''
law school Dean Henry G. Manne told The Washington Post.
   Bork's appointment is the latest in a series of notable hirings
by Manne, who is intent upon building up the name of the school.
   ``There's no question that they've been doing a remarkable job
over there,'' said Thomas Morgan, a law professor at George
Washington University and president of the Association of American
Law Schools. ``George Mason has improved more than any other law
school in the country in the last five years.''
   Recognition of that came earlier this week in a U.S. News &amp;

nation's top ``up-and-coming'' law school.
   Bork joins Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg, another would-be Supreme

<HEAD>Guerrillas Announce Suspension of Attacks On Non-Military Targets</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist rebels say they've
called off assassination attempts on civilian officials and attacks
on public transport to show they're serious about resuming peace
talks with the rightist government.
   ``It is now up to (President Alfredo) Cristiani's government,''
Salvador Sanchez Ceren, a member of the guerrilla directorate, told
a news conference in Mexico City. ``He has the ball. Let's see him
play with it.''
   Guerrilla commanders also said Tuesday that they have purchased
arms from U.S.-supported Nicaraguan rebels and other Central
American sources so they have not been affected by the electoral
loss of their Sandinista allies in Nicaragua.
   The commanders said they would suspend the unpopular civilian
attacks to try to seize the initiative against the Salvadoran
government and avoid blame for extending the 10-year-old war.
   In a communique, the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front
said that as of Friday, it would cease attacks on public transport,
commercial establishments and telephone lines.
   The communique said the guerrilla front also would halt attacks
on government officials and civilians who ``are not part of the
military or paramilitary apparatus of the armed forces of El
Salvador.''
   Schafik Handal, another member of the front's five-person
general command, said government and guerrilla negotiating
positions have not changed since October, when the two sides met in
San Jose, Costa Rica.
   ``They are setting pre-conditions that would paralyze our
activity on a military and political level. That's unrealistic,''
he said.
   He said the guerrillas were ready to join a political process in
El Salvador, but their major condition remains the same: the armed
forces must be ``purified, reduced and restructured'' to get rid of
those who have tried to suppress political pluralism in favor of a
narrow oligarchy.
   The two commanders said the Salvadoran army is planning to
launch attacks on the guerrillas because they believe the guerrilla
front has been weakened by the Sandinista election loss in
Nicaragua last month. President Daniel Ortega is to give way to
President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro on April 25.
   ``We are not now receiving arms from Nicaragua, and we have
never depended on Nicaragua for arms,'' said Handal. ``That is
about to become clearer. Central America is a huge arms market.''
   ``We have bought arms from the Contras and we have the chance to
buy more,'' Sanchez said.
   The U.S.-supported Contra guerrillas based in Honduras, which
lies between Nicaragua and El Salvador, have been fighting the
Sandinista government since 1981 and are negotiating to disband and
return to Nicaragua following Mrs. Chamorro's victory.
   The Contras have sold weapons to the leftist Salvadoran rebels
in the past _ guerrillas encountered using the weapons in the
countryside complained that they were old and beat up _ but
Sanchez's was the first confirmation from a senior guerrilla
commander.
   Sanchez called the elections in Nicaragua ``a great example of
democracy that should be pursued all over Latin America.''
   He added that the question for the Cristiani government is
whether it will ``open up a real democratic process.''
   Handal noted that although El Salvador's population is almost
twice as large as Nicaragua's, the two nations have about the same
number of registered voters _ more than 1.7 million in Nicaragua,
about 1.8 million in last year's Salvadoran presidential election _
and that abstentions brought the total vote in El Salvador down to
less than 1 million in a nation of more than 5.2 million.
   Handal added the Salvadoran guerrillas would not consider

   A man who shot and killed his former
girlfriend as shoppers at a mall ran for cover was himself slain by
a mystery man in the parking lot who pulled out a gun possibly
fitted with a scope, police say.
   Police had said after the shooting Monday at Irving Mall in this
Dallas suburb that they believed Eddie Edwards, 41, shot himself to
death while fleeing.
   But on Tuesday police said witnesses reported Edwards was killed
by a vigilante who chased Edwards to his automobile.
   Police searched for the vigilante today. Capt. Travis Hall said
the man would be charged with murder.
   Edwards killed his former girlfriend, Demetria Yvonne Taylor,
28, after the woman, an instructor at American Airlines, had left
her part-time job at a mall clothing store and was walking through
the parking lot, police said.
   Edwards chased her toward a mall entrance and fired twice,
missing her, then shot her in the head. He shot her again at close
range, Hall said.
   Officers said one of the shots hit a wall in a video arcade only
inches from where a young girl was playing a video game. Other
bullets struck objects in an area containing several fast food
restaurants where shoppers were eating.
   Hall said that as Edwards fled from the mall, a man got out of
his car, brandishing a big handgun. The man fired two shots at
Edwards' car as it left the mall. The man stayed around a few
minutes and then drove away, Hall said.
   Some witnesses said the pistol was equipped with a scope, Hall
said.
   Police found Edwards in his car on a road near the mall, a
bullet wound in his side.
   Hall said police believe the vigilante acted on impulse after
witnessing the slaying.
   ``Edwards violently murdered this woman,'' Hall said. ``She's
down, she's wounded, and he goes and shoots her in the head again
after she's down.''

   He owns no shoes, only boots. He rides a
horse like a cowhand. He admits to two fistfights since turning 50
and likes a cold beer after work.
   And now, millionaire oilman-rancher-businessman Clayton
Williams, whose hero is John Wayne, is the Republican nominee for
governor.
   ``When we began this journey there weren't a whole lot of folks
who gave us much of a shot,'' Williams told a hotel ballroom full
of whooping supporters after humbling all comers in Tuesday's GOP
primary.
   ``In the words of that world-famous philospher Jackie Gleason,
`How sweet it is.'''
   Williams, 58, combined his folksy humor, love of all things
Texan and a multimillion-dollar TV ad campaign that rivaled a
Hollywood movie to rise from an asterisk in the early polls to an
outright, no-runoff victory.
   Throughout the primary, he showed a knack for publicity and a
charisma that his trio of lawyer-challengers couldn't touch.
   When told that one of his Wild West-style TV commercials seemed
to lack only John Wayne or Gary Cooper, Williams aide Mona Palmer
seemed puzzled.
   ``We have Clayton,'' she said. ``Why would we need them?''
   He was endorsed by retired Texas Rangers. He nicknamed his
campaign's barbecue truck ``Lonesome Gov.'' Stumping in Abilene, he
grabbed a sledgehammer and personally demonstrated his plan to have
drug dealers ``bustin' rocks.''
   As his campaign cruised to conclusion, ``Claytie'' saw
supporters clamoring for autographs and TV network correspondents
lining up for interviews.
   GOP rival Tom Luce called Williams a candidate more suited to
the 1890s, saying, ``You can't ride horseback into the space age.''
   Williams just laughed. ``I didn't know I had as many faults as I
seem to have until I became the front-runner,'' he said.
   An unknown political commodity making his first bid for office,
the Midland businessman spent nearly $6 million of his own money on
his $8 million campaign.
   Williams says he founded 26 companies and created more than
100,000 jobs since his graduation from Texas A&amp;M in 1954. Those
included Clajon Gas Co., the largest individually owned natural gas
company in the state, and the ClayDesta long distance phone company.
   Williams ruled out a tax increase and said he opposed abortion
in most cases. Pledging an all-out war on drugs and promising to
put a business-based balance sheet to government, Williams
delighted in bashing ``career'' politicians.
   Opponents, including Railroad Commission Chairman Kent Hance,
criticized his lack of experience in government. Williams said that
was a plus.
   ``The biggest applause I get is when I say I'm not a politician
and I'm not a lawyer. The longer politicians are in Austin or
Washington, the worse job they seem to do,'' he said.
   The three other major Republican candidates all were lawyers.
The top three Democrats were current or former officeholders.
   Drugs are his top issue, Williams said, and a major reason he
decided to run. A son became involved with drugs in 1986. ``While
he made it, a lot of those little kids didn't. And they're in my
heart,'' he said.
   Williams said he can persuade the Democratic-controlled
Legislature to do things his way, pledging to lobby lawmakers
personally. A sales call, if you will.
   ``I am a very good salesman,'' he said, urging onlookers to
study his attractive wife, Modesta. ``Take a good look at me, look
at my profile. Now look at Modesta. You think I'm not the
sellingest son-of-a-gun you've ever seen?''

   The master of underwater pogo sticking, marathon
yodeling and long-distance juggling has muscled his way into the
Guinness record book with another peculiar pastime, cranking out
1,551 squat-thrusts in an hour.
   Ashrita Furman, already a Guinness world record-holder a dozen
times over, performed his latest feat Tuesday before awestruck
observers in a Manhattan gym.
   ``I don't think he's human,'' said the gym's owner, Robert Fuchs.
   Maybe not: After shedding two pounds and nearly passing out
during his hourlong stunt, the 35-year-old health food store
manager went for a run ``to loosen up.'' His hands still bore
bloody blisters from slapping the mat.
   ``I feel fantastic,'' he said.
   ``The guy is amazing,'' said Fuchs, owner of the Natural
Physique Centre, who kept count and monitored Furman's style.
   ``He's phenomenal,'' said David Boehm, editor of the U.S.
edition of the Guinness Book of World Records. ``He's only one of a
number of what you might call nuts setting these records. But he
wanted to have more records than anybody else, and he does.''
   Furman has walked, hopped, run, rowed, pogo-sticked,
somersaulted, bent, balanced and yodeled his way to a dozen entries
in Guinness' U.S. edition. His squat-thrusts, once certified by the
editors, will make it 13.
   ``When you edit this book, you're never astounded at anything
these people do,'' sighed Boehm. ``If you met Ashrita not knowing
about the records, you'd say he was quite sane.''
   Furman insists that there's a method to his madness.
   ``Sure, some of these things are totally stupid,'' he said.
``But it's the principle of the thing. There's a lot of
determination and concentration involved.''

<HEAD>Death of Psychologist Bruno Bettelheim Called Suicide</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto NY51 sent March 13.</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Psychoanalyst Bruno Bettelheim, a student of
Sigmund Freud who taught that violent fantasies and fairy tales
were part of a healthy child's psychology, killed himself at a
nursing home at age 86, authorities said.
   Bettelheim died Tuesday of suicidal asphyxiation at The Charter
House in Silver Spring, Md., said Dr. John E. Smialek, Maryland's
medical examiner. Smialek declined to give details. Friends said
Bettelheim recently had suffered a stroke.
   A survivor of the Nazi death camps, Bettelheim came to the
United States during World War II and became a pioneer in treating
childhood mental disturbances. His vivid writings reached millions
of readers.
   From 1944 to 1973, Bettelheim ran The Sonia Shankman Orthogenic
School for disturbed children at the University of Chicago.
   ``He had a marvelous talent for being able to see the world
through the eyes of the other even if the other was a tremendously
bizzare person,'' said Jacquelyn Sanders, who took over the school
when Bettelheim retired. ``He was able to see the world through
that person's eyes so that person no longer became bizzare.
   ``And he was able to write about them in the way people could
understand.''
   ``The Uses of Enchantment,'' written with Karen Zelan in 1976,
won Bettelheim the National Book Award and the National Book
Critic's Circle Award.
   In it, he held that fairy tales represent the struggle for
identity that children wage against their parents. Hostile
fantasies toward parents can be safely channeled through enjoyment
of punishment inflicted on witches and demons.
   A December review in the Chicago Tribune of his last book,
``Freud's Vienna and Other Essays,'' noted Bettelheim's ``shrewd
grasp of the sometimes petty human circumstance behind the grand
achievement.''
   For example, Bettelheim admitted becoming interested in Freud's
theories at age 13 in order to impress a girl.
   Bettelheim was born Aug. 28, 1903, in Vienna and studied there
under Freud. A Jew, he was sent to the Dachau and Buchenwald
concentration camps. After his release in 1939, he gained early
fame for his study of death camp prisoners.
   In ``Surviving,'' an essay published in The New Yorker in 1976,
he said prisoners who survived were those who lived not for life's
sake but for some cultural ideal that transcended them.
   At the Orthogenic School, Bettelheim insisted on constant
attention for severely disturbed children and stayed there from
early morning until after midnight nearly every day, said Benjamin
Wright, a former colleague.
   ``He would not take no for an answer no matter how difficult the
child was,'' said Wright.
   The school's success stories include several college professors,
authors and a stockbroker, he said.
   Dr. Raymond Fowler, chief executive of the American
Psychological Association in Washington, said Bettelheim's 1950
book on his experiences at the school, ``Love is Not Enough,''
influenced Fowler to become a psychologist.
   Some of Bettelheim's theories were criticized as overly harsh on
parents. He contended at one time that mentally ill mothers were
responsible for autism in children.
   He softened his views in the 1987 book, ``A Good Enough Parent:
A Book on Child-Rearing,'' which said parents are innately ``good
enough'' to raise children.
   Bettelheim became professor emeritus at the University of
Chicago in 1975.
   ``He told me that once you were in a camp, you could never
escape the cruelty,'' a longtime colleague and friend, Rudolf
Ekstein, told The New York Times. ``He turned it upside down when
he started his school for disturbed children. It was a protected,
caring environment, the mirror opposite of the camps.''
   His other works included ``Dynamics of Prejudice'' (1950),
``Truants from Life'' (1955), ``The Informed Heart'' (1960), and
``The Children of the Dream'' (1969).
   Bettelheim's wife, Gertrud Weinfeld, died in 1984. He is
survived by three children.
   Funeral arrangements were not immediately known.

<HEAD>Controversy Continues over Claim to be Billy the Kid</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A retired historian-author who has been
trying to prove that a Texan who died in 1950 was really Billy the
Kid said he'd like to see the identity decided by a federal court.
   William A. Tunstill said a recent photographic study comparing a
tintype of Billy the Kid and pictures of Ollie L. ``Brushy Bill''
Roberts failed to put the isue to rest.
   The study, part of a broader study undertaken by the Lincoln
County Historical Trust, concluded 41 other people in the
comparison looked more like Billy the Kid than ``Brushy Bill'' did.
   Roberts, who died in Hico, Texas, a week shy of his 90th
birthday in December 1950, had claimed to be the legendary New
Mexico outlaw. Most people, including a coroner's jury of the time,
say Sheriff Pat Garrett shot Billy the Kid to death in Fort Sumner,
N.M., on July 14, 1881.
   ``Brushy Bill died a Christian, but I'm not sure of those who
accuse him (of lying),'' Tunstill said.

<HEAD>Clash With Cuba Over U.S. Broadcasts Looms</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HAVANA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The next big clash between Cuba and the United
States is just over the horizon, literally. It takes the form of a
U.S. balloon floating above the Florida Keys designed to beam
``capitalist'' programming to Cuba.
   After years of preparations, testing of the Voice of America
broadcast operation will begin shortly, and Cuban officials are
guaranteeing an energetic response to what they regard as a blatant
intrusion on national sovereignty.
   They want no part of U.S. news shows, sitcoms and soap operas.
They are not convinced by U.S. arguments that the station, known as
TV Marti, will not be a propaganda mouthpiece for rightist
militants.
   ``Tele-aggression'' is just one of the epithets that Communist
President Fidel Castro uses in denouncing the U.S. plan.
   Speaking to a gathering of 50,000 students Tuesday night, Castro
said the Bush administration officials are ``not even capable of
appreciating how much they offend the heart and the sentiments of
our people.''
   Castro said that despite setbacks in Eastern Europe and
elsehwere in the socialist world, the Cuban Revolution will survive
because it is based on just ideas. ``The ideals of our country are
immortal,'' he said.
   Castro was flying today to Brazil for the presidential
inauguration in that country.
   Ramon Sanchez Parodi, a vice foreign minister, says Cuba is
considering a range of retaliatory measures for TV Marti, including
curtailing travel and telephone communications between Cuba and the
United States.
   Another possibility is that Cuba, with the use of high-powered
trnasmitters, will interfere with U.S. radio broadcasts over a huge
area west of the Mississippi.
   At a minimum, Cuba will take steps to ensure that TV Marti will
not reach Cuban living rooms.
   ``We have absolutely no doubt we can block the signal,'' says
Gary Gonzalez, a vice president of the Cuban Institute of Radio and
Television.
   The planned jamming comes months after the Soviet Union and its
former East European satellites, embracing democratic reform,
stopped jamming Western radio broadcasts.
   Technical problems have led to repeated delays in initiating the
testing phase of TV Marti. The latest target date is sometime this
month.
   The station is seen as a televised version of Radio Marti, a VOA
project named for 19th century Cuban revolutionary Jose Marti that
beams news and entertainment designed for Cuban audiences.
   The signal for TV Marti is to be sent from a tethered balloon
about 10,000 feet above the Florida Keys. A lofty perch is required
to ensure the signal is not blocked by the curvature of the Earth.
   Part of the rationale for the TV and radio projects is that the
Cuban people, U.S. officials say, have been systematically denied
access to balanced information in the government-controlled media.
   Says Rep. John Miller, R-Wash., ``We are in a struggle of ideas,
which is better than military struggle. Castro has never offered
not to spread his ideas throughout Latin America.''
   Some Cubans see TV Marti as a potentially bright addition to the
drab fare often transmitted on their stations.
   But Gonzalez said the portrayal of Cuba as a country closed to
outside influence is misleading. He says 42 percent of all movies
shown on Cuban television are American-made.
   There are also a number of U.S.-made programs for American
children shown in Cuba, he says.
   The legislation that created TV Marti permits a 90-day period
after the initial testing to evaluate legal and technical
considerations before actual programming can begin.
   But Sanchez Parodi says the Cuban response will be delivered
immediately after testing begins.
   ``We will do more than just block the signal,'' he says.
   Cuban officials argue the proposed station violates U.N.
agreements that protect local broadcasting systems from outside
interference.
   They also see TV Marti as yet another element in a continuing
U.S. campaign to undermine Castro's three-decade-old rule.
   But the Bush administration may be forced to scuttle the project
because of technical problems.
   Some U.S. officials say there is not much the administration can
do if Cuba succeeds in blocking the transmission.
   Beyond that, there also is concern that the project may
interfere with broadcasting by south Florida stations. Under the
legislation, if that problem cannot be resolved, TV Marti must be
turned off.

<HEAD>Urban Indian Hearse Project Helps Take Native Americans `Home'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Indians unable to afford hearses no longer
have to use pickup trucks to ferry their dead to reservations for
burial.
   They can now turn to the Urban Indian Hearse Project, which has
taken 217 people ``home'' free of charge since the non-profit
organization made its first run in October 1987.
   The project evolved out of a small group of people who used to
take the dead from the Twin Cities to reservations in personal
vehicles as a kindness, said John Stone, who coordinates the effort
from Indian Family Services in south Minneapolis.
   ``They would take them back in the back of a pickup truck or
station wagon or whatever that they could, partly because the cost
that a funeral home charges to transport a body from the urban
area,'' Stone said.
   For example, the transportatio cost from a Twin Cities funeral
home to the Red Lake Indian reservation in northern Minnesota, a
539-mile round trip, is around $900, Stone said.
   Some of the metropolitan area's 18,000 American Indians had no
choice but to inter their dead in local and unfamiliar cemeteries.
Without transportation, they couldn't use free plots among their
relatives on tribal burial grounds, said Stone, who lives in
Bloomington and grew up on the White Earth reservation in
northwestern Minnesota.
   That changed with the donation of two used hearses by the
Minnesota Chippewa tribe and the formation of the hearse project.
   ``It's meant that they've been able to have the type of funeral
important to the Indian heritage,'' said David Karsnia, owner of
the David-Donehower Funeral Home in Detroit Lakes, which serves
White Earth.
   Charles Stately of Minneapolis is among those who have donated
to the hearse project. He remembers what it did for his family when
his mother, Elaine M. Stately, died in August 1988.
   ``It was a hard time, and my mother was a long way from where
she was born and wanted to be. It was real nice to deal with
Indians,'' Stately said. ``All the things that happened were hard
to handle except that part of it. That went smoothly.''
   With the hearse project's help, Stately was able to fulfill his
mother's wish to be buried on the White Earth reservation, where
she was born.
   ``It's where her family has their roots. She identified with the
land,'' he said.
   The Rev. James Notebaart with the Office of Indian Ministry for
the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis sees the project in
spiritual terms.
   ``It's not a business and it's not an attempt to be `cheap,' but
it's part of their whole sense of unity and communion in life and
death,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dental Needles, Drills Likely to Be Obsolete in Next Decade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   What if you don't want to open your mouth wide,
have a needle plunged into your gums and feel a drill grinding the
most tender of your teeth?
   Just be patient and look forward to that as-yet-unscheduled
dental appointment in the year 2000. That's when dental experts
believe the drill will be obsolete and the needle replaced with an
electronic anesthesia machine.
   The technology will be demonstrated to 17,000 dental
professionals attending the 78th annual Thomas P. Hinman Dental
Meeting Friday through Monday in Atlanta.
   Among research to be presented is the development of a laser
that experts predict will make the dental drill obsolete by the end
of this decade.
   ``The 1990s are going to be incredible for dentistry,'' said Dr.
Tom Truhe, director of the Princeton Dental Resource Center in
Princeton, N.J.
   Forty percent of U.S. adults do not have regular dental
checkups. Studies blame this failure on many people's belief that
they do not need checkups, as well as on the fear of needles and
drills.
   ``We're working on reasons two and three,'' Truhe said, adding
that a time lapse of eight to 10 years exists between the time new
techniques are developed and the time they are used in dental
offices.
   The laser, being studied at the University of Detroit, vaporizes
tooth decay without the noise, vibration or smell often associated
with dental drills.
   Truhe said lasers also decrease the chances of tooth decay
returning around fillings.
   But while lasers can penetrate dentin _ the second level of
tooth covering _ they have not been able yet to pass through the
hardest and outermost tooth layer, enamel.
   Also, Truhe said, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration so far
has approved lasers only for use on soft tissues.
   Still, there is little doubt, Truhe said, that lasers will be
the standard of care for repairing dental cavities by the year 2000.
   Also, electronic anesthesia machines have been developed to
deaden pain through battery power. The FDA-approved machines
already are in use in some dentists' offices and are still being
researched at the University of Colorado.
   The machines employ electrical impulses that travel through
battery wires to small adhesive pads attached to the patient's
mouth.
   Truhe explained that the impulses deaden pain by flooding nerves
with non-painful stimuli so that painful stimuli cannot pass
through. The impulses also increase the brain's production of
pain-lessening chemicals such as serotonin and endorphins.

<TEXT>
   The U.N. Security Council's five permanent members
have proposed an ambitious administrative role for the United
Nations in Cambodia, diplomats said today, reporting progress
toward ending the country's civil war.
   A communique released after two days of talks in Paris appealed
to Cambodia's warring factions to ``delegate all necessary powers''
to the U.N. during a transitional period in which free elections
would be organized.
   Under the proposal, the four Cambodian factions would jointly
form a Supreme National Council that would occupy the country's
seat in the United Nations but cede day-to-day administrative
responsibility to the U.N.
   U.S. diplomats said at a briefing today that the five permanent
Security Council members _ the United States, Soviet Union,
Britain, France and China _ had made ``significant progress''
toward agreement on details of the proposal.
   They said a unified approach by the U.N. would be needed to
persuade the Cambodian factions to compromise after more than 11
years of civil war.
   Factions involved are the government of Premier Hun Sen,
installed by Vietnam, and the resistance coalition of three parties
_ the Khmer Rouge, a Communist group that is the strongest
guerrilla organization, and non-Communist insurgent forces led by
Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodia's former ruler, and Son Sann, a
former premier.
   The proposal by the five Security Council members would require
the Hun Sen government to yield sovereignty, although a U.S.
diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said government
employees might be allowed to remain in their posts under U.N.
supervision.
   Details of the possible size and cost of the U.N. contingent
have not been made final. An American official said there was no
precedent for a U.N. force administering an entire country in
addition to arranging elections.
   One obstacle during previous talks among the Cambodian factions
was the opposition of Khieu Samphan, a Khmer Rouge leader and vice
president of the guerrilla coalition, to using the word
``genocide'' to describe Khmer Rouge actions in Cambodia in 1975-78.
   The Khmer Rouge government led by Pol Pot killed hundreds of
thousands of Cambodia's 8 million people while trying to turn the
country into an agrarian commune. A Vietnamese invasion in December
1978 overthrew the Pol Pot regime.
   A U.S. official said the dispute over the genocide issue had
been used in the past to obstruct negotiations and expressed hope
that it could be set aside temporarily.
   ``We believe those responsible for genocidal violence presently
have little electoral support,'' he said.
   All factions have indicated previously they would accept some
U.N. role, including election supervision, but there is
disagreement over how Cambodia should be governed until the
elections are held.
   Hun Sen and his Vietnamese backers have contended that
dismantling the government might open the way for the Khmer Rouge
to seize power again.
   Attending the Paris talks were Richard Solomon, U.S.
undersecretary of state; David Gillmore, undersecretary in the
British Foreign Office; Claude Martin, France's director of Asian
affairs; Igor Rogachev of the Soviet Union Xu Dunxin of China, vice
ministers of foreign affairs; and Rafeeuden Ahmed, a U.N. assistant
secretary-general.
   The parties plan to meet again in Paris in May, and have asked
the U.N. to provide detailed logistical information for use in
future discussions.
   On the agenda in May, according to diplomats, will be the
current Cambodian military situation, the prospects for some sort
of peacekeeping force, and the issue of whether Vietnamese troops
have resumed military support of Hun Sen despite assurances of a
September withdrawal.

<HEAD>Tokyo Stocks At Lowest Level in a Year, Dollar Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's chief index closed at
its lowest level in a year today, while the dollar declined against
the yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 268.44 points, or 0.82
percent, ending the day at 32,352.13, its lowest level since March
28, 1989, when it closed at 32,306.36.
   Dealers attributed the index's losses to intermittent selling by
arbitrageurs _ mainly foreign securities firms _ throughout the day.
   After a series of rises and falls, the index ended the morning
session with a 8.94-point gain when index-linked buying won over
artibrage selling, traders said. But it soon fell back due to
selling by pessimistic institutional investors in addition to
arbitrageurs, said Yasumasa Shinagawa, a Yamaichi Securities dealer.
   ``Investors have little interest in buying issues because
economic factors around the market remain the same'' without any
positive incentives, he said.
   ``Participants are now trying to push down the index until the
market hits bottom,'' Shinagawa said. He said traders expect the
bottom will lie somewhere below 31,000 points.
   Dealers said institutional investors were inclined to sell ahead
of the fiscal year-end account settlements for company budgets
earmarked for investments in financial markets.
   Account settlement for fiscal 1989 for most Japanese
institutional investors is slated for Thursday.
   ``There are only a limited number of issues that participants
find safe to invest in, because they think company performances
have been poor due to the stock exchange's plunge this year,'' said
a dealer with Nomura Securities, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Analysts have blamed computer-aided large-scale arbitrage
trading, in which participants profit from price gaps between the
spot and futures markets, for recent sharp declines in the Nikkei
index, especially when overall volume is low.
   Today's volume on the market's first section was estimated at
480 million shares, up slightly from Tuesday's 400 million.
   The Nikkei index on Tuesday registered its fourth-largest
decline this year, dropping 747.66 points, or 2.24 percent, because
of a wave of arbitrage selling, dealers said.
   Following a combined decline of 1,372.55 points on Monday and
Tuesday, the Nikkei index has lost more than 6,500 points, or 16.9
percent, since the beginning of this year.
   In currency dealings, the dollar ended trading at 152.20 yen,
down 0.47 yen from Tuesday's closing of 152.67 yen. It opened lower
at 151.90 yen and ranged between 151.70 yen and 152.47 yen.
   The dollar weakened today mainly because of technical
adjustments and profit-taking, said Kenzo Shinomiya, a trader with
Fuji Bank.
   ``The dollar's slip is a temporary phenomenon because market
players have long (over-bought) dollar positions as a result of so
much dollar-buying around 152 yen,'' he said.
   The U.S. currency's fall today does not indicate a trend because
market demand for the dollar remains strong, he said.
   Other traders said Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno's
scheduled return to Tokyo from Europe on Thursday also was putting
pressure on the dollar, since the market expects the central bank
to raise its official discount rate shortly after he returns.
   Market players expect the bank to raise the discount rate by as
much as 1 percentage point from the current 4.25 percent.
   ``Since it has been expected for more than a month, a discount
rate hike is likely to have little impact because the figure is
already factored into the market,'' Shinomiya said.
   Benchmark No. 119 Japanese government bonds closed at 86.19
points, up 0.13 from Tuesday's closing of 86.06. Their yield fell
to 7.305 percent from the previous day's 7.325 percent.

   A hospital has given out the first $100
prizes to women who seek early prenatal care in a so-called Healthy
Baby Lottery.
   It wasn't a huge jackpot, but it was fun for Hope Allen, one of
the six expectant mothers who picked up their winnings Tuesday
outside Memorial Hospital.
   ``It'll come in handy, but it's just the thrill of winning it,''
she said.
   Doctors and nurses hope to generate publicity with the winners
to entice other pregnant women into making early visits to the
hospital.
   ``What we're trying to do is get a message out to a group of
women who normally do not listen to health care messages,'' said
Dr. Larry Culpepper of Memorial Hospital's department of family
medicine.
   Six monthly prizes from $25 to $100 will be awarded to women who
have sought prenatal care before their 12th week of pregnancy.
Those who seek care before the 10th week got a $50 bonus. Every six
months a $500 drawing will be held for women who complete their
doctor's recommended prenatal care.
   Deborah Piche, 26, another lottery winner, had no insurance or
job but went to the doctor after reading about the lottery, and won
$50 plus the $50 bonus for seeking care at her seventh week of
pregnancy.
   Mrs. Piche, 26, who is having her first child, said she would
have gone to a doctor ``eventually, but I don't think I would have
gone as soon.''
   Sixty-six women got prenatal checkups in February, an average
number, Culpepper said. But about 55 percent of the women enrolled
before their 12th week, and less than 30 percent do so normally, he
said.
   About 6 percent of the babies born to the 1,500 women who
deliver at Memorial each year are below normal birthweight. They
run up an average bill of $23,000, Culpepper said.
   ``So, if we prevent one low birthweight baby, or one handicapped
child, which I think it is likely to do, then I think it's worth
it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Police Bar Demonstrators from National Assembly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNIE HUANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 2,000 riot police carrying shields
and clubs formed a human wall near the National Assembly today to
block a march by demonstrators demanding the retirement of elderly
lawmakers.
   ``It is absurd that we let these senile and selfish assemblymen
run the nation's electoral body,'' shouted Hung Chi-chang, an
assemblyman from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party.
   The 752-seat National Assembly is Taiwan's electoral college and
will elect the island's next president on March 21.
   Like the other branches of Taiwan's tricameral Parliament, the
assembly is dominated by elderly Nationalist Party stalwarts who
have not faced voters since the government fled to Taiwan in 1949
after losing the Chinese civil war.
   They have been frozen in office to support a Nationalist claim
to be China's legitimate government.
   The 300 demonstrators chanted slogans demanding the resignation
of the aged lawmakers and the dissolution of the National Assembly
before their march was halted near the assembly grounds by police
behind a barbed wire barricade.
   They then staged a three-hour sit-in near the barricades.
   The demonstrators, led by Democratic Progressive Party Chairman
Huang Hsin-chieh, also were angered by an assembly decision Tuesday
that barred all the party's 11 assemblymen from taking their seats
because they had refused to take an oath to the ``Republic of
China,'' the name under which the Nationalists founded their nation
in 1911.
   The demonstrators claimed the opposition delegates were barred
so the assembly could ram through changes to the country's
constitution, including an amendment that would require approval
from the elderly assemblymen to any bills dictating their
retirement.
   Reporters estimated more than 2,000 policemen guarded the
grounds of the National Assembly in the picturesque mountain resort
of Yangmingshan in Taipei's suburbs.
   During the sit-in, an assembly committee passed a controversial
proposal for the National Assembly to meet annually, rather than
once every six years, to review bills adopted by the lawmaking
Legislative Yuan.
   The proposal was rejected earlier by the Nationalist Party's
decision-making central standing committee because of public
pressure. The National Assembly is to vote on the proposal later
this month.
   Four independent assemblymen, angered at the committee's action,
toppled the podium in the committee room and ripped out microphones
before leaving the meeting in protest.
   ``This is a big joke, a historical blemish of this party,'' said
Sun Jung-chi, a Nationalist Party assemblyman who was elected in
Taiwan.
   Many analysts believe the annual meetings will expand the powers
of the National Assembly and hinder future democratic reforms.
   President Lee Teng-hui, 67, and his running mate, presidential
adviser Li Yuan-zu, 66, are expected to be elected to a six-year
term by the National Assembly despite some opposition, even from
members of the Nationalist Party.
   Lee became the first native Taiwanese to head the Nationalist
government in 1988 when he was elevated from the vice presidency
following the death of President Chiang Ching-kuo.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell against most major foreign
currencies in moderate European trading today. Dealers said the
currency appears to be losing some of its recent bullish momentum.
   Gold prices rose.
   ``The dollar doesn't have the momentum to go much further just
now,'' said Andrew Ellott, a senior foreign exchange sales manager
at Chase Manhattan Bank in London.
   Kenji Kawahara, foreign exchange manager at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank
in London, attributed the bearish view to a decline in U.S. equity
and Treasury bond prices late Tuesday.
   Dealers said Sunday's East German elections could set a new
direction for the foreign exchange markets.
   ``The uncertainty about the elections and the whole political
situation is a factor that people don't dare to do anything,'' said
a trader at a U.S. bank in Frankfurt.
   ``To trade the dollar higher is also dangerous because the
central banks could come in, even though they haven't done much
recently.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.47 yen to a closing 152.20 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a lower rate of 152.10 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.7127 West German marks, down from 1.7165
   _1.5232 Swiss francs, down from 1.5275
   _5.7880 French francs, down from 5.7915
   _1.9265 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9312
   _1,264.25 Italian lire, down from 1,267
   _1.1725 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1775
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound, and was
quoted at $1.6077, compared with $1.6005 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $398 a troy ounce, up
from $396.55 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $398.80.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $399, up from $396 late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 27 cents to close at a bid
$399.35.
   Silver rose in London to a bid price of $5.08 a troy ounce from
Tuesday's $5.05.

<HEAD>East Has a Heat Wave; Plains Hit by Twisters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The record-breaking heat in the East and Midwest was joined by
some summer-like humidity today, while Plains states recovered from
the tornadoes that cut through them.
   The funnel clouds plowed through Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa,
Oklahoma and Texas on Tuesday, killing two people, injuring at
least 22 and wrecking scores of houses.
   A severe thunderstorm watch was posted today for much of eastern
Iowa, parts of southern Wisconsin, and a small part of northwest
Illinois.
   Tornadoes touched down during the afternoon east of Bloomfield,
Iowa, as well as east of Bettendorf, Iowa; near Castleton, Kan.,
south of Hutchinson, Kan., near Lindsay, Okla., north of Shelton,
Neb., at Smith Center, Kan., at Wood River, Neb., near Cedar
Rapids, Iowa, at Port Byron, Ill., at Dribble, Okla., at Criner,
Okla., at Le Claire, Ill., near Red Cloud, Neb., north of Haven,
Kan., and west of Monticello, Iowa.
   Thunderstorm winds gusted to about 60 mph near Freedom, Fort
Supply Lake and Woodward in Oklahoma, and at Russell, Lyons and
Turon in Kansas.
   Showers and thunderstorms continued into the evening across
southwest lower Michigan, northern Illinois, central and southern
Wisconsin, Minnesota, eastern South Dakota, central and eastern
Kansas, Iowa, western Missouri, western Arkansas, Oklahoma, and
through eastern Texas. Rain extended along the northern Pacific
Coast. Snow was falling over the southwest third of Montana,
eastern Idaho, north-central Arizona, the Nebraska Panhandle and
northeast Colorado.
   Record high temperatures for the date were broken in numerous
cities. Among them: Akron, Ohio 75; Allentown, Pa. 83; Alpena, Mich
63; Atlantic City, N.J. 86; Augusta, Ga., 87; Baltimore 85;
Bridgeport, Conn., 84; Charlotte, N.C., 86; Cleveland, 76; Grand
Rapids, Mich., 75; Lynchburg, Va., 86; New York 85; Philadelphia
84; and Wilmington, Del., 85.
   Today's forecast called for rain in parts of the Pacific
Northwest, as well as the north-central states and parts of New
England. Thunderstorms are predicted along a low front from Texas
to the Great Lakes region. Snow flurries are expected in parts of
Colorado, Nebraska and the Dakotas.
   The nation's high Tuesday was 93 degrees at the Marine base near
Cherry Point, N.C.

   A second man died of burns today after a
ruptured propane pipeline exploded and destroyed 10 homes in a
cauldron of fire.
   At least four people were injured in the blast Tuesday about 40
miles south of Albany. The fire burned itself out at about 5 a.m.
today and a cap was placed on the hole in the pipeline, according
to Schoharie County sheriff's officials.
   ``Right where we're standing was just a big ball of flames,''
said Schoharie Fire Department Lt. Joe Balfe. ``You couldn't get
close to anything because you weren't sure what was going to blow
up next.''
   The 8-inch underground pipeline exploded twice as the valley
community about 40 miles from Albany awakened shortly before 8
a.m., officials said. The blast knocked out electricity and phones
up to 15 miles away.
   Sheriff's officials said investigators would begin examining the
damaged pipe later in the day in an effort to find out what caused
the blast. Residents said that a fog-like vapor had rolled down a
hill toward their homes just before the explosion.
   Ten homes were reduced to blackened debris.
   ``They didn't burn long, the heat was so intense,'' said Shirley
Hilgers, whose convenience store escaped damage. ``They were down
in 10, 15 minutes.''
   Richard Smith, 43, of Central Bridge, died Tuesday. Early today,
Robert Hitchcock, 53, of North Blenheim died at Westchester County
Medical Center.
   Hitchcock's 16-year-old daughter, Roberta, was in fair condition
at Ellis Hospital in Schenectady with burns on her face and hands,
and Michael Kodra, 58, of Howes Caves, was treated for burns and
released, officials said.
   Two others, Linda Huber, 31, of North Blenheim, and her
4-year-old son, Shawn, were treated for smoke inhalation and
released from Community Hospital of Schoharie County in Cobleskill.
   The pipeline, owned by Texas Eastern Products Pipeline, is part
of a system that begins in Mont Belvieu, Texas, and winds its way
4,100 miles to Selkirk, about 10 miles from Albany, said company
spokesman John Barnett.
   More than 300 firefighters, ambulance workers and law
enforcement officials descended on Blenheim and worked nearly three
hours putting out fires.
   The propane, which is heavier than air, apparently seeped about
a mile along a creek bed into a small valley where the houses were
located.
   Virginia Noxon said she was in her kitchen when the propane
washed over her house.
   ``I looked out my kitchen door and I saw all this white stuff
building up and I said, `I've never seen fog like this before,'''
she said. ``I turned around and everything blew. It got all pink
and everything and at first I thought it was a tornado. Then I
heard Bang! Bang! Bang! Everything blowing up.''
   The force of the explosions blew her across the room, but she
was not injured.
   ``When it first happened, we thought an airplane had crashed
into the side of the hill,'' said Liz Mace. ``I was just getting
ready for work and there was this horrendous explosion. It sounded
like a jet when they pass the sound barrier.''

<TEXT>
   Lawmakers of both parties are lining up behind
President Bush's request for a quick infusion of $300 million for
Nicaragua, but problems are arising that could slow the package's
progress through Congress.
   Bush asked Congress on Tuesday to provide the money by April 5
to help incoming President Violeta Chamorro rebuild the Central
American country's war-weakened economy.
   He added another request: that lawmakers approve a stalled $500
million in aid for Panama, which the president proposed after the
United States overthrew Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The $800 million in immediate aid for Nicaragua and Panama would
be diverted from the current military budget, perhaps the first
real ``peace dividend'' from the receding Cold War.
   ``The important thing to keep in mind is that we have an
opportunity that is just unparalleled,'' Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind.,
a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said today.
``This is a tremendous opportunity to shift the global balance of
power in a direction favorable to us,'' he said on ``CBS This
Morning.''
   Appearing with Hamilton, Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., former
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said, ``I
approve of the president's plan to assist Panama and Nicaragua ...
we have great opportunities to assist in building new democracies.''
   Speaking at a news conference, Bush announced the lifting of the
5-year-old trade embargo against Nicaragua, which the United States
had used in its efforts to dislodge the leftist Sandinista
government of President Daniel Ortega. And he said he would seek an
additional $200 million for Nicaragua next year.
   ``These nations need our help to heal deep wounds inflicted by
years of strife and oppression, years of loss and deprivation,''
Bush said. ``And we must act and act soon.'''
   On Capitol Hill, words of support for Bush's request soon
followed.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said lawmakers would
need more details about where the money would come from and how it
would be spent, but said, ``We want to work with them and do it as
soon as possible.''
   ``The people of Nicaragua and Panama have courageously opted for
freedom and democracy,'' said Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan. ``We can't let them down now.''
   ``We express our support for both'' the aid package and the end
of sanctions, the Nicaraguan embassy said in a statement. It
invited U.S. experts to inspect Nicaragua's economic situation at
first hand.
   Complications arose as well, however.
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., chairman of the Senate Appropriations
Committee, said he would withhold action on Bush's request for aid
for the Central American countries until the administration
proposes specific savings to pay for it.
   In a letter to Secretary of State James A. Baker III, Byrd
referred to a conflict between himself and the president that has
been brewing since last month.
   In February, Bush proposed withholding $2.2 billion in defense
spending planned for this year, much of it slated for arms projects
that are popular in Congress. The administration wants to spend
some of that money for different weapons and use other parts of it
for the Central American aid.
   But the president's proposal angered Byrd and the appropriations
panel's ranking Republican, Sen. Mark Hatfield of Oregon. They
argued that Bush's plan to stop the spending was illegal, and
called on him to reverse his decision. The dispute remains
unresolved.
   ``We have no interest in delaying action on these important
matters,'' Byrd wrote.
   The aid measure could also be slowed by unrelated amendments
that lawmakers might attach to it.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., has signaled he will seek to append a
$400 million housing credit program to help Israel resettle newly
emigrated Soviet Jews. And others say there may be efforts to cut
or restrict aid to El Salvador over congressional concerns about
human rights in that country, or efforts to use the bill to boost
aid to emerging Eastern European democracies.

   Millionaire oilman-rancher Clayton Williams
got everything he hoped for _ the Republican nomination for
governor and the prospect of a bruising Democratic runoff between
Treasurer Ann Richards and Attorney General Jim Mattox.
   ``In the words of that world-famous philosopher Jackie Gleason,
`How sweet it is,''' Williams told a hotel ballroom full of
whooping supporters after humbling all comers in Tuesday's GOP
primary with 61 percent of the vote.
   With 98 percent of precincts counted, the West Texas businessman
got 511,007 votes. Railroad Commissioner Kent Hance, a former
Democratic congressman, was a distant second with 129,662, votes,
or 15 percent. Further back were lawyer Tom Luce with 113,542
votes, or 14 percent, and former Secretary of State Jack Rains,
with 80,400 votes, or 10 percent.
   Ms. Richards and Mattox ran neck-and-neck in the brutal
Democratic race, sinking the comeback hopes of former Gov. Mark
White. With 98 percent of precincts reporting, Ms. Richards had
561,080 votes, 40 percent, to Mattox's 521,494, or 37 percent.
White received 274,551 votes, or 19 percent.
   Because no Democrat got more than half the vote, the two top
vote-getters will meet in a runoff for the nomination April 10.
   Before the polls opened, Williams said he hoped to avoid a
runoff so he could relax and ``have some fun watching each of the
Democrats murdering on each other.''
   On Tuesday night, he added, ``This has been a spirited primary
and at times things have gotten a little testy, although looking at
the Democrats' mess makes us looks like a bunch of sissies.''
   Ms. Richards told her campaign workers: ``Well, this is gonna be
a good night, y'all. But do you have enough money for a runoff?''
   Williams, who calls himself ``just a country boy'' and admits to
occasional fistfights, spent $8 million _ $6 million from his own
pocket _ in rolling to victory in his first run for office. The
58-year-old combined folksy humor, love of all things Texan and a
multimillion-dollar TV campaign to rise from an asterisk in the
early polls.
   Ms. Richards, known for her caustic keynote speech at the 1988
Democratic National Convention in which she said then-Vice
President Bush was ``born with a silver foot in his mouth,'' easily
topped opinion polls after entering the race last June in a bid to
become the state's first woman governor since Miriam ``Ma''
Ferguson left office in 1935.
   But she stumbled after finding herself in a race characterized
by mudslinging.
   Rivals lashed out at Ms. Richards, a recovering alcholic, for
refusing to say whether she had ever used illegal drugs; she
accused them of profiteering from public service. White and Mattox,
for their part, called Ms. Richards a liar.
   In a preview of things to come, both Ms. Richards and Mattox
were at one another's throats moments after White conceded Tuesday
night.
   ``I hope Ann gets her consultants under control. She ran some
pretty harsh ads against Mark and myself and I hope it stops
because I intend to discuss the issues,'' Mattox said.
   Ms. Richards again challenged Mattox to follow her lead and make
public his tax returns. ``It's going to be a very difficult 28
days,'' she warned. ``We're going to talk about who truly believes
in ethics in public office.''
   In the Republican race, no challenger could match Williams'
bankroll.
   After initially pledging to spend $3 million from his own
pocket, he wound up spending far more than that on a nearly
flawless campaign that included television commercials that
analysts called some of the best ever.
   ``The Democrats are in for the contest of their life in
November,'' said Luce. ``He's a superb nominee for our party.''
   Turnout was estimated at 2 million of the 8.3 million eligible
voters, who could cast ballots for either party. The number voting
was the highest in a Texas primary in an year not involving a
presidential race.
   Absentee balloting was expected to account for up to 25 percent
of the vote. It was the first gubernatorial race in Texas since the
state allowed people to vote absentee without stating a reason.
   Texans also voted on the U.S. Senate seat held by Republican
Phil Gramm, who has no GOP opponent in his bid for a second term.
State Sen. Hugh Parmer, a 50-year-old Fort Worth lawyer, easily won
the Democratic nomination by defeating Harley Schlanger, a follower
of extremist Lyndon LaRouche.
   Jim Hightower, the state agriculture commissioner who raised
controversy at every turn, pulled 65 percent of the vote to win the
Democratic nomination for re-election against six opponents
supported by the Texas Farm Bureau.
   Hightower bills himself a friend of the small, independent
farmer, but brought the wrath of some ranchers with his support of
hormone-free beef. Republicans last year failed in their bid to
have the Legislature abolish his job.
   State Sen. Rick Perry will meet Richard McIver, owner of a
geologic consulting firm, in a runoff for the GOP nomination.

<HEAD>Brazil Bars Entry of Heavy Weapons By Castro's Bodyguards</HEAD>

   Brazilian authorities prevented Fidel
Castro's bodyguards from bringing a cache of heavy weapons into the
country to protect the Cuban leader during his visit this week, the
Foreign Ministry said.
   Castro is to attend the inauguration on Thursday of
President-elect Fernando Collor de Mello in Brasilia, the capital.
On Friday, Castro travels to Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo.
   A plane, carrying the weapons and the Cuban mission, with 83
passengers and 15 crew, arrived Saturday and was detained for nine
hours at the Brasilia airport before being sent back to Havana,
said Deputy Foreign Minister Paulo Tarso Flecha de Lima. The people
aboard were allowed to remain in Brazil.
   The Rio newspaper Jornal do Brasil reported Tuesday that the
plane was carrying 10 tons of heavy weapons, including machine
guns, grenades, rocket launchers and an antiaircraft cannon.
   Flecha de Lima did not confirm the plane's exact contents but
said ``there were no portable arms.'' He attributed the incident to
``an excess of zeal'' on the part of Castro's bodyguards.
   ``It was not a diplomatic incident, but only an operational
one,'' said Flecha de Lima. He said the weapons were returned to
Havana and the Cuban leader's security agents would only be allowed
to carry pistols and revolvers in Brazil.
   Details of Castro's visit have been kept secret. The only time
the Cuban leader visited Brazil was in 1959, the year he took power
after overthrowing dictator Fulgencio Batista.
   Brasilia broke diplomatic relations with Havana after Brazil's
anti-Communist military coup in 1964. Relations between the nations
thawed with the return of civilian rule in 1985 and were restored
the following year.
   The Foreign Ministry announced that 121 countries will be
represented at the inauguration of Collor de Mello, Brazil's first
president elected by the people in 29 years. He was voted into
office in November 1989.
   Castro is one of 27 heads of state and government who will
attend the ceremony. The United States will be represented by Vice
President Dan Quayle.

   A sweeping order in the drug-trafficking case
against Manuel Noriega provides ground rules for thousands of
documents defense attorneys say will prove U.S. officials approved
of the deposed Panamanian dictator's actions.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler also tentatively scheduled
the trial of Noriega and his co-defendants for Jan. 28, 1991, a
date Noriega attorney Steven Kollin called ``realistic.''
   The judge capped weeks of legal wrangling Tuesday when he issued
the 12-page protective order defining how the Classified
Information Procedures Act of 1980 will be applied in the Noriega
case.
   ``On the whole, I'm pleased with it,'' Noriega attorney David
Lewis, an expert on classified documents, said in a telephone
interview from Washington. ``In terms of which side got more, I
think we did very well.''
   Diane Cossin, a spokeswoman for acting U.S. Attorney Dexter
Lehtinen, said ``We're pleased that they're pleased. We're not
getting the whole pie here, but we're not unhappy.''
   Classified information belonging to any federal agency that
deals with national security, as well as information from Noriega's
private dealings with more than 20 foreign governments, must first
be reviewed by the Justice Department's court security officer
before it can be introduced as evidence, Hoeveler said.
   Information in books, newspapers and other publications are
similarly restricted if the published reports include confirmation
by someone with access to classified information and if the Justice
Department believes it could affect national security, Hoeveler
ruled.
   But Hoeveler denied several key restrictions sought by the
government, including a demand that defense attorneys immediately
submit to prosecutors, as well as the neutral court security
officer, any sensitive evidence they plan to introduce at trial.
   The judge also refused prosecutors' requests for a lifetime gag
order that would have forced anyone given access to classified
documents to get prior approval from intelligence agencies before
speaking about that information.
   Prosecutors were ``seeking a protective order that was far more
restrictive than anything ever seen before. Judge Hoeveler in all
respects denied those problematic requests,'' Lewis said.
   The order also restricts the defense attorneys for Noriega and
his co-defendants from sharing information without prior approval
from the government.
   That stipulation, Lewis said, would have little impact because
Noriega is the only defendant intending to use classified
information at this point.
   Also Tuesday, Hoeveler released Daniel Miranda, a pilot accused
in the Noriega indictment of flying drug profits to Panama, on $1
million bond.
   Miranda, 36, is the second of the six defendants taken into
custody to be released on bond. Brian Alden Davidow, a Miami-area
resident, turned himself in to federal authorities immediately
after the February 1988 indictment was handed up, and has been free
since then.
   Still jailed are Noriega aide Luis del Cid, who has been
negotiating a plea bargain; accused Colombian cocaine trafficker
William Saldarriaga; Eduardo Pardo; and Noriega. Ten other
defendants are still at large.
   Noriega, who is accused of accepting bribes from Colombian
cocaine traffickers and turning his country into a conduit for
drugs smuggled into the United States, was flown from Panama on
Jan. 4 following the U.S. invasion.

   Former President Jimmy Carter arrived in
Syria today and said he expected to discuss the plight of foreign
hostages in Lebanon when he meets with President Hafez Assad.
   ``It's obvious to me that the Syrian leaders are very eager to
see the hostage question solved and so see the hostages released,''
Carter told reporters on arrival at Damascus international airport.
   The former president, who arrived from Egypt, was due to meet
Assad and other officials before continuing his tour with visits to
Jordan and Israel.
   Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa, who greeted Carter, said he
was ``not pessimistic'' about freeing hostages in Lebanon. ``As we
did exert a lot of efforts in the past to gain the release of so
many hostages ... we are still continuing to exert such intensive
efforts,'' Sharaa said.
   Syria, with roughly 40,000 troops in Lebanon, is the main power
broker in that war-ravaged country. But most of the hostages are
believed to be held by groups influenced by Iran and often at odds
with Syria.
   Recent statements by some Iranian leaders urging freedom for the
hostages had raised hopes that a release might be imminent. But a
hard-line Iranian figure, former Interior Minister Ali Akbar
Mohtashemi, recently denounced calls for the hostages to be freed.
   ``Those statements are equivocal,'' Carter said, referring to
comments by Iranian leaders. ``One day it's a positive statement.
The next day it's a rejection of a positive statement.
   ``But I don't think there's any doubt that the leaders of Iran
have a great influence on the future of the hostages,'' he added.
   Diplomats and Syrian officials in Damascus have said in recent
days that there are few signs that a release is imminent.
   Eighteen foreigners, including eight Americans, were taken
hostage in Lebanon. The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press, who will have
been held five years on Friday.
   Carter, who is on a private tour of the Middle East, leaves
Syria for Jordan on Friday. Since he left office in 1979, Carter
has visited the Middle East four times, monitoring peace efforts.
   In talks in Atlanta and in Africa, he also has mediated
conflicts between the Sudanese and Ethiopian governments and rebels
waging war against them.
   Carter, who sponsored the 1978 Camp David talks that led to
Israeli-Egyptian peace, said he also was using his current trip to
the Middle East to explore prospects for a final end to
Arab-Israeli hostilities.
   ``We hope for a comprehensive settlement of all the issues,
including that between Syria and Israel, in the future,'' he said.
   Carter said a proposed dialogue between Israelis and
Palestinians that has split the Israeli government ``would be a
precedent-setting first step which we hope would lead to even
broader agreements in the future.''
   Israel's coalition government collapsed Tuesday in a dispute
over what sort of Palestinians Israel should agree to talk with.
   Carter told reporters in Egypt he thought ``there is still a
good chance for ... dialogue,'' especially if a government led by
one faction _ rather than a deadlocked coalition of leftist Labor
or hard-line Likud _ is formed.
   Carter also supported President Bush's opposition to settlement
of Soviet Jews in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Sharaa expressed Arab concerns that the hundreds of thousands of
Soviet Jews expected by Israel would displace Palestinians from
their homeland and make the return of Palestinian refugees to their
homes impossible. He opposed emigration even to Israel itself.
   ``The Soviet Jews can go anywhere in the world ... but not to
Palestine, because the human rights of the Palestinian people, of
the Arabs under occupation, should be given priority,'' he said.
   ``There are millions of Palestinians outside their country,
there are thousands of Syrians outside of the Golan Heights, and
there are thousands of Lebanese outside the south of Lebanon.
   ``And all these are deprived of the right to return to their
homes and property'' by Israel, Sharaa added.
   Israel seized Syria's Golan Heights in the 1967 Middle East war
and later annexed it. In 1985, Israel created a ``security zone''
in southern Lebanon to protect its northern borders from attacks by
Arab guerrillas.

<HEAD>Afghan Foreign Minister: Government Will Remove Arms Stockpiles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Afghanistan will destroy its huge
stockpiles of Soviet-supplied weapons if the United States and
other countries stop supporting the Moslem rebels, the foreign
minister said today.
   The minister, Abdul Wakil, said the rebels also should destroy
their stockpiles.
   Previously, the administration had called only for a halt in
military supplies to both the rebels and the Soviet-backed
government in Afghanistan's 12-year-old civil war. The offer to
destroy the stockpiles could eventually help pave the way for peace
talks on Afghanistan.
   Wakil made the announcement one week after forces loyal to
President Najib crushed a coup attempt led by then-Defense Minister
Shah Nawaz Tanai.
   The Soviet news agency, Tass, reported today that 200 civilians
died and 500 were wounded in the failed coup. The Kabul government
has said 95 civilians died and 197 were wounded. No military
casualties have been released.
   On Tuesday, a spokesman for the Kabul government reported the
Moslem guerrillas attacked the strategic southern city of Khost and
also were fighting government forces around eastern Jalalabad,
another key city.
   Since the coup attempt, Soviet aid to Najib's government has
increased. More than 30 transport planes, carrying 25 tons of
weapons and medicine each, land daily at Kabul's airport, Eastern
European diplomats said.
   In addition, the government said Tuesday that 4,200 tons of
goods from the Soviet Union reached Kabul by land in the last three
days.
   Wakil lashed out at Pakistan today, accusing the neighboring
Moslem nation of ``masterminding'' the coup attempt. Pakistan,
which allows the Afghan rebels to operate from its territory, has
denied similar charges by Kabul officials in the past.
   In a statement apparently released Tuesday by Tanai in Pakistan,
the former defense minister said he was planning to unite with the
guerrillas to topple Najib, who was installed as president by the
Soviets in 1986.
   Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan in December 1979, and pulled
out under a U.N.-brokered agreement in 1989.
   Tanai, a hard-line Communist, is generally considered
responsible for Afghanistan's successful defense of Jalalabad
against the guerrilla attacks that followed the Soviet withdrawal
in February 1989.
   Wakil's statement on Kabul's willingness to eliminate its
stockpiles of arms would apparently remove a stumbling block in
negotiations over ending the war in Afghanistan.
   During the Soviet occupation, the country amassed huge
stockpiles of weapons, including thousands of trucks, tanks,
armored personnel carriers, bombs, missiles and guns.
   Since the Red Army's withdrawal, Western analysts said Moscow's
military assistance has been about $300 million a month, including
an estimated 1,000 scud missiles.
   In negotiations last year, the United States rejected a Soviet
proposal for each superpower to stop military aid to their allies
in the civil war. The United States objected because the proposal
would have allowed the Communist government in Kabul to keep
existing stockpiles of weapons.
   Washington also opposed the plan because at that time U.S.
analysts believed Kabul would fall quickly to the U.S.-backed
rebels.

<TEXT>
   A recall election narrowly retained the
mayor who led an unsuccessful campaign to ban fur sales, but ousted
one of his council supporters.
   Mayor Bill Stirling held onto his seat Tuesday with 1,227 voting
to keep him in office and 1,097 favoring a recall.
   He interpreted the results as support of his efforts to limit a
``feeding frenzy'' of greedy developers.
   What people want, he said, is to ``slow down _ not halt _ but
slow down speculative development and really get going with
affordable housing.'' Typical single-family house prices in the
fashionable resort, a favorite skiing spot for celebrities, surpass
$1 million.
   Voters last month rejected Stirling's ballot proposal to ban the
sale of furs in Aspen, as well as another measure to limit the size
of a Ritz-Carlton hotel under construction.
   Those hoping to oust a majority of the five-member council
accused the recall targets of being rude and unresponsive to
constituents' concerns.
   Councilman Michael Gassman kept his seat with a 1,347 to 965
vote; Councilman Frank Peters was retained by a margin of just 30
votes _ 1,142 to 1,112.
   Residents recalled councilman Steve Crockett by a 1,288 to 1,025
margin in favor of Margot Pendleton, a concrete contractor.
Crockett's critics considered him too confrontational.
   The turnout was more than 60 percent, despite heavy snow and
good skiing conditions.
   ``I think that people reacted to the very negative approach that
was taken by the pro-recall people in their campaign. And I think
people got a little tired of it,'' Stirling said late Tuesday.
   Many voters told pollsters from the Aspen Times Daily they
retained the incumbents because they disapproved of the recall
campaign.
   ``It's just been unfair,'' said 23-year-old Aspen resident Ellen
Marshall. ``All the council has done is carry out the mandate they
were given when they were elected ... This whole thing is sad.''
   Some longtime residents believe Aspen has lost its soul in
becoming a playground for the rich and famous. But recall
supporters said efforts to save Aspen by limiting growth have
become exclusionary and nasty.
   Aspen's population is said to peak at about 20,000 in the
winter; it has about 3,700 registered voters. Many property owners
do not live here full time, and real estate prices have skyrocketed
during the past decade.
   Aspen, home to eccentrics like ``gonzo'' journalist Hunter S.
Thompson, was the first U.S. community to pass a tough anti-smoking
ordinance and the first to declare itself a nuclear-free zone.

<HEAD>Vatican Rebuilds and Revives Persecuted Church in Romania</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTOR L. SIMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Vatican today restored the leadership of
the long-persecuted Roman Catholic Church in Romania and revived
the Eastern rite branch that was suppressed there more than 40
years ago.
   Pope John Paul II appointed 12 bishops to restore the strength
the church enjoyed before a crackdown on religion began in 1948.
   It marked the biggest step forward by the Vatican in Eastern
Europe since the former hard-line regimes began to crumble last
year.
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said the church was
``overjoyed'' by the moves in Romania and hinted that a restoration
of diplomatic relations with Bucharest, cut by the Communists in
1950, was not far off.
   Romanian clergy have also invited the pope to visit the country,
but Navarro said no date has been fixed.
   The appointments were made possible by the actions of Romanian
authorities in January suspending 1948 decrees that sharply
curtailed the freedom of Roman Catholics and forcibly incorporated
the Eastern or Byzantine rite Catholic church into the Orthodox
Church.
   Their 1,800 churches were confiscated, and bishops and priests
who refused to accept the merger were jailed, a situation similar
to that in the Ukraine.
   In recent days, Vatican officials have been in the Soviet Union
to negotiate with Soviet and Orthodox Church authorities on the
revival of the Ukrainian Catholic church.
   But there has been no action taken yet on a law guaranteeing
freedom of religion, which would legalize the Ukrainian Catholic
church and was promised by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev when he
met with the pope here in December.
   Two of the new Eastern rite bishops in Romania are in their late
70s, or past the normal Vatican retirement age. Navarro said the
nominations were in recognition for their suffering for the church.
Both had been imprisoned for years and one of them, Bishop
Alexander Todea, 77, of Alba Julia, had been sentenced to death in
1951 and freed in a 1964 amnesty.
   All had practiced their religion underground in what the Vatican
calls the ``catacomb'' church.
   The Vatican estimates there are 2.8 million Catholics from the
two rites in Romania.
   The nominations restore the Roman and Eastern rite churches in
Romania to their pre-1948 strength of six and five bishops
respectively. Before today, only two Roman dioceses were headed by
bishops.
   Navarro stressed the nominations were made independently by the
pope with no interference by the Romanian government.
   Over the past year, the Vatican has re-established diplomatic
relations with Poland and Hungary.
   Last month, the pope also finished restoring the church in
Czechoslovakia to full strength for the first time since World War
II, but that was carried out over a period of time and not on a
single day as in Romania.
   The pope is scheduled to visit Czechoslovakia next month.
   While there is no immediate move for the Vatican and Bucharest
to re-establish full relations, Navarro said the Romanian
govbernment is returning the embassy building confiscated 40 years
ago.
   Still to be resolved is the issue of religious orders, which
were banned in Romania in 1948 and all their property seized.

   ``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' an

Network's cartoon series about an off-kilter family. It was 20th in
the ratings for the week.
   It beat the first half-hour of a repeat of CBS' ``Murder She
Wrote,'' in 29th place. ``Elvis,'' tied for 47th, and the competing
half-hour of NBC's ``Magical World of Disney'' landed in 71st place.
   For the week ended March 11, NBC was first with an average of
13.5, ABC was second with 12.2 and CBS was third with 11.0. Each
ratings point represents 921,000 homes.
   Here are the top 10 shows, their network and rating: ``America's
Funniest Home Videos,'' ABC, 24.1; ``Cheers,'' NBC, 23.4;
``Roseanne,'' ABC, 22.1; ``The Cosby Show'' NBC, 21.3; ``A
Different World,'' ABC, 20.7; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 19.6; ``The
Wonder Years,'' ABC, 18.7; ``The Golden Girls,'' NBC, 18.1; ``In
the Heat of the Night,'' NBC, 17.9; ``Who's the Boss,'' ABC, 17.5.
   ABC's ``World News Tonight'' led the news ratings for the ninth
consecutive week. ``NBC Nightly News'' and the ``CBS Evening News''
tied for second place.
   ABC said the margin of victory for ``World News Tonight'' was
the highest in the program's history. Of the three newscasts, only
ABC's program, with anchorman Peter Jennings, increased its
audience.
   For the week that ended March 9, it averaged an 11.5 rating, up
0.4 point from the previous week. NBC's newscast and CBS'
broadcast, which has been slumping in the ratings, each averaged
9.7.
   Compared with ratings for the same week a year ago, last week's
ratings showed a 16 percent drop for CBS' newscast, according to
ABC estimates.
   The once-dominant ``CBS Evening News'' with Dan Rather was third
in each of the three weeks preceding the latest Nielsen estimates.

<HEAD>Separate Intra-Christian, Shiite Moslem Clashes Break Out in
Beirut</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shiite Moslem militia allies of Syria and
Iran fought each other in the streets of south Beirut today a few
blocks away from where most of the Western hostages are believed
held captive.
   Police today also reported intermittent gunfire between rival
Christian militias in east Beirut.
   Clashes broke out early in the day between the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah and the Syrian-backed Amal militia in the slums of south
Beirut, said a police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with
regulations.
   Police said three people were killed and 10 wounded before
Syrian soldiers intervened and disengaged the combatants around 1
p.m. That brought the overall toll to seven killed and 34 wounded
since the Amal-Hezbollah clashes broke out Tuesday evening.
   Fighters of the two warring Moslem factions fired automatic
rifles and rocket-propelled grenades across the narrow streets
separating their positions, the spokesman said.
   The fighting was reported in the Shiyah, Ouzai and Bir Hassan
districts, a few blocks west of Hezbollah's Hajjaj and Hay Madi
barracks, where most of the 18 Western hostages are believed held.
   Eight of the hostages are American. The longest held is Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,
who was abducted March 16, 1985.
   Staccato bursts of machine-gun fire accompanied by grenade
explosions echoed across Moslem west Beirut as bearded Amal and
Hezbollah fighters traded fire.
   Motorists honked horns hysterically and sped away in all
directions to escape the confrontations. Hundreds of worried
parents, fearing the possible spread of fighting, rushed to schools
to take their children home.
   Amal, in a communique, blamed the escalation on ``Mohtashemi's
followers in the so-called Hezbollah.''
   Amal claims Hezbollah's leader, Sheik Sobhi Tofeili, supports
former Iranian Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, a hard-liner
who was ousted as government minister by President Hashemi
Rafsanjani in August.
   Mohtashemi opposes releasing the Western hostages and reaffirmed
that line in a virulent editorial published in a radical Tehran
newspaper Saturday. He also opposes Rafsanjani's moves to improve
relations with the West.
   The Lebanese Shiite mufti, or supreme religious judge, Sheik
Abdul Amir Qabalan, also blamed the intra-Shiite confrontation on
Hezbollah.
   The police spokesman said Amal and Hezbollah fighters erected
several checkpoints in their respective areas of influence and were
checking identity cards and kidnapping each other's followers.
   The two militias have been battling for more than two years for
mastery of the 1.2 million Shiites, who make up the largest
community in Lebanon, which has a population of 4 million.
   By police count, more than 1,030 people were killed and 3,046
wounded in previous Amal-Hezbollah battles.
   In another violent development, police said one person was
killed and two wounded in an intermittent exchange of sniper fire
between rival Christian forces in east Beirut overnight.
   That raised the overall toll to 757 killed and 2,106 wounded in
the intra-Christian fighting since Jan. 30, when clashes broke out
between renegade Gen. Michel Aoun's troops and fighters of Samir
Geagea's Lebanese Forces militia.
   The two forces, fighting for dominance of the 310-square-mile
Christian enclave, accused each other of blocking efforts by a
Christian mediation committee to work out a settlement to their
bloody dispute.
   The dispute has developed into the worst confrontation among
Christians in the nation's 15-year-old civil war.

<HEAD>Business Inventories Rise 0.2 Percent in January</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business inventories edged up 0.2 percent in
January, the government said today, but were offset by a 0.3
percent gain in business sales.
   The Commerce Department said inventories rose to a seasonally
adjusted $795.9 billion after falling a revised 0.4 percent in
December.
   The December drop, originally reported to be 0.2 percent, was
the first since a 0.1 percent decline in October 1988 and the
largest since a 0.6 percent fall in December 1986.
   Business sales, meanwhile, rose to a seasonally adjusted $523.0
billion after falling a revised 0.2 percent in December. December
sales originally were reported to be unchanged from November.
   The January business activity produced a 1.52 ratio of
inventories to sales, the same as in December. That means that it
would take 1.52 months to exhaust inventories at the January pace.
The ratio was 1.53 in both October and November.
   Inventories often rise during periods of slow economic growth as
output exceeds demand. If they were to pile up excessively, it
could mean cutbacks in production and a loss of jobs.
   However, economists do not feel the ratio is at a dangerous
level.
   Retail backlogs fell 0.6 percent in January, while sales rose
2.8 percent.
   Part of the improvement in retail inventories came as automobile
companies temporarily laid off thousands of workers during the
month to trim the number of motor vehicles stuck on backlots. Auto
inventories dropped 3.6 percent.
   Manufacturing inventories rose 0.7 percent, while sales dropped
1.9 percent.
   Wholesalers' inventories edged up 0.2 percent, while their sales
gained 1.4 percent.

<TEXT>
   For Michael Graf, the brief and
seemingly anarchic East German election campaign is too much too
soon.
   ``Nobody knows quite what to think,'' the burly 20-year-old
toolmaker says over a beer in this cheerless, decaying industrial
town. ``Everything happened a bit too quickly.''
   Half a year after the first wave of protests started in Leipzig,
many East Germans are bewildered by the need to choose among 24
slates of candidates in Sunday's election. Thousands of contenders
are running for spots in the 400-seat Parliament.
   A recent West German poll said a quarter of the 12.3 million
voters are undecided in this country of about 16 million people.
   New groups are facing formidable obstacles in campaigning. The
renamed Communists try to blend into the democratic landscape,
stressing their defense of East Germany's cradle-to-grave social
safety net. Graf says he has trouble deciding what the parties
stand for.
   ``We'll know what we have voted for only after the elections,''
Graf says.
   And with non-Communist parties getting massive aid from their
West German counterparts, the choices for East German voters is not
entirely home-grown.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, these parties are being directed from
the other side,'' Graf says.
   The choices include the conservative Alliance for Germany, the
left-of-center Social Democrats and even several radical leftist
splinter groups. West Germany's extreme right, which had hoped to
field candidates, was barred from the campaign.
   Opposition activists say the country was not ready for a
Western-style campaign and worry openly that unity in opposing the
Communists has turned to political polarization.
   Campaign posters of all parties are being torn down and papered
over by rivals at an increasingly frantic pace as Sunday's vote
nears. Vandalism against party offices has been reported in several
places. A leading conservative politician, Wolfgang Schnur,
resigned after admitting he was a secret police informer.
   Social Democratic party chairman Ibrahim Boehme is sleeping in a
different bed every night on the advice of security experts, the
West German news magazine Der Spiegel reported.
   But apart from some defaced posters, election fever seems muted
in Eberswalde, about 37 miles northeast of Berlin with a population
of 45,000.
   As elsewhere in East Germany, the lack of big commercial
advertising spaces precludes campaign publicity on a Western scale.
   Local opposition activists say citizens are only slowly
accepting that they should control who governs them, not vice versa.
   ``Our biggest problem is that people continue to think in old
terms. They say: Just let those `up there' do the work,'' says
Bernd Christmann of the new but increasingly important Social
Democrats.
   ``It's sad but true. The Prussian mentality has survived _ that
sense of duty and subservience to the pressure of authorities,''
adds Andreas Kriesten, a 36-year-old Protestant minister heading
the local office of the Christian Democratic Union. The formerly
Communist-aligned Christian Democrats are in a three-party
conservative election alliance.
   Earlier euphoria about the promise of prosperity through
unification with West Germany seems to be fading. Worries are rife
about the future of the state-coddled economy and social services
now that West German firms are storming to convert their eastern
neighbor to capitalism.
   Several hundred citizens have come to seek information since the
Social Democrats opened a shabby two-room office on Eberswalde's
main thoroughfare six weeks ago.
   ``They ask about social security, their jobs, kindergarten,
school lunches,'' Christmann says.
   Steffen Joswig, Graf's drinking buddy, says he shares those
worries. At the same time, the 32-year-old waiter doesn't want to
risk seeking a new life in West Germany with his wife and three
children.
   ``I don't know who I'll vote for, but definitely not the PDS
(Communists),'' he says.
   ``All my friends have gone over,'' Graf adds. ``But I'm waiting
for the elections. I'm not winding up in a refugee camp in West
Germany.''
   Polls suggest that neither the Social Democrats nor the
conservative alliance will gain a parliamentary majority, thus
forcing a national unity government that probably would be another
transitional solution.
   The campaign has been even shorter than originally planned.
Opposition groups and the government agreed to move up the planned
May 6 balloting when East Germany threatened to sink into political
chaos in January.
   Despite the current uncertainties, campaign posters saying
``Socialism, never again'' bear witness to the fundamental change
since hard-line Communist boss Erich Honecker was ousted Oct. 18.

   North Korea agreed today to participate
in a joint investigation of what U.S. and South Korean engineers
said was an ``invasion tunnel'' dug under the border separating the
two nations.
   U.S. and South Korean officials said they were surprised by
North Korea's apparent willingness to accept a proposal by the
U.S.-led United Nations Command for an investigation. The last time
the two nations jointly investigated a border incident was in 1967.
   At a meeting of the Korean Military Armistice Commission at this
truce village, North Korean delegate Maj. Gen. Choi Ui Ung denied
his nation dug the tunnel and agreed to ``promptly conduct a
comprehensive and scientific joint investigation of the so-called
tunnel which you allegedly have found.''
   Choi said he would send a 60-member inspection team made up of
experts and journalists to the tunnel site via helicopter.
   Adm. Larry G. Vogt, the senior U.S. delegate at the armistice
meeting said the offer was ``an encouraging sign and we will
consider it.''
   But Choi declared a late reply would mean the rejection of his
nation's acceptance of the joint investigation.
   The North Korean general demanded an immediate investigation,
but Vogt said the proposal lacked the necessary details and
procedures required under the 1953 Korean Armistice Agreement.
   United Nations Command officials said procedures do not allow
either side to send a large delegation across the border by
helicopter. They also noted that the North Korean proposal was
unclear as to whether it would allow South Korea equal
participation in the probe.
   One United Nations Command official said his organization would
make a counter-proposal that ``fits the framework of the armistice
agreement.''
   The tunnel was discovered on March 3, in a remote mountainous
area along the 155-mile border.
   It was the fourth tunnel found since 1974 and was about two
yards high and two yards wide, large enough for three armed
soldiers to run through abreast. South Korean officials said a
regiment could pass through in an hour.
   It has not been clear when the tunnel was built. North Korea
denied building tunnels beneath the border that were found in 1974,
1975 and 1978 and suggested they were old mining tunnels.
   Meanwhile in Seoul, 13 radicals protesting joint U.S.-South
Korean military exercises were arrested by police after they pushed
their way inside a gate at the headquarters of the U.S. 8th Army.
   There was no damage to the U.S. facility and no injuries, police
said.
   North Korea has demanded cancelation of the exercises, now under
way.
   In the central city of Taejon, police fired tear gas to break up
a demonstration of about 300 students who were march to nearby
Chungnam University, throwing firebombs and shouting ``Yankee go
home!''
   The Korean peninsula was divided in 1945 at the end of World War
II. Capitalist South Korea and Communist North Korea fought a
bloody three-year war in the early 1950s and remain bitter enemies.

<TEXT>
   Authorities cordoned off this town of 3,000
today, and called out the National Guard to help residents recover
from a tornado that killed two people and injured 19.
   The tornado Tuesday night carved a 100-mile path through the
flat countryside for 2{ hours, leaving about 100 ruined houses in
its wake.
   ``I looked out our back door and I saw this thing coming,'' City
Administrator Jay Weiland said. ``I thought `Oh, my God, there goes
my town.'''
   National Guard troops arrived about midnight to help with the
cleanup and prevent looting. Law enforcement officers were allowing
only emergency personnel, residents and reporters into the area
this morning.
   The National Weather Service warned today of more twisters in
Texas and Oklahoma. More than two dozen funnel clouds touched down
Tuesday across the Plains from Texas to Iowa, including more than a
dozen in south-central Kansas.
   The dead in the Hesston area, just north of Wichita, were a
6-year-old boy and a 68-year-old woman. A missing woman and her
teen-age son were found safe.
   The killer tornado touched down southwest of Hesston, cut a
1{-block-wide swath through the community, then moved along to the
northeast, chewing up farmhouses in Marion and Morris counties.
   ``I saw at least four to five houses that had roofs torn off,''
said Kenneth Kaluhiokalani in Morris County. ``Belongings were
scattered through the yards and glass was shattered in houses.''
   From 75 to 100 houses were damaged in Hesston; 19 farmhouses
were damaged in Marion County and at least five in Morris County.
   Six-year-old Lucas Fischer of Burrton, a few miles south of
Hesston, was pronounced dead Tuesday evening at Halstead Hospital,
said house supervisor Marian Krallman. His brother, 12-year-old
Garrett, was in satisfactory condition with head injuries.
   Harvey County Sheriff's investigator Byron Motter said the boys
were among seven people huddled in a basement to escape the storm
when a chimney and fireplace collapsed.
   ``We were in the basement no more than a minute or two, then it
crashed,'' said Paul Wedel, a neighbor who had sought refuge there.
   Ruth Voth, 68, died when the tornado swept into her home near
Goessel, about 10 miles northeast of Hesston, authorities said.
   Authorities said 19 people were treated at area hospitals for
storm-related injuries, and at least two were in critical condition.
   About 50 people made homeless spent the night at Hesston High
School, said principal Marvin Estes.
   There was no electricity or gas in the town, and workers were
making emergency repairs to the water system, said Jay Wieland,
Hesston City administrator.
   Winds from the tornado blew off the roof of a Pizza Hut
restaurant, and about 15 customers and employees huddled in a
walk-in freezer and bathrooms. No one was injured.
   Residents of Hesston had a warning. One twister dissipated
before reaching the town, and sirens sounded half an hour before
the second funnel entered town at 5:30 p.m.
   Clarence Froese was taking care of his invalid son-in-law in
Hesston when the tornado struck.
   ``We had just put him on a sheet and drug him into the basement
when the storm hit,'' said Froese. ``I didn't know what happened
until I got back out. It was devastation all over.''

<TEXT>
   Jerusalem's mayor said today that President Bush
has written to him promising that the United States supports a
united Jerusalem.
   Jerusalem ``must never again be a divided city,'' Bush wrote in
a March 13 letter to Mayor Teddy Kollek and distributed at a news
conference here. Kollek also distributed the letter he wrote to
Bush on March 8.
   Bush warned against ``steps that could prejudice the prospects''
for Arab-Israeli negotiations on Jerusalem's future, but wrote
nothing about Jewish settlement in the Arab eastern sector of the
city captured by Israel in the 1967 war.
   Last week, Bush made a statement apparently lumping east
Jerusalem, which Israel regards as its sovereign territory, with
the West Bank, which is under Israeli military occupation. Israel
strongly objected, saying Jerusalem was a separate issue.
   Asked at a news conference at the Israeli Embassy whether he
believed Bush's letter canceled the president's earlier statement,
Kollek said: ``That is my strong impression.''
   Bush's letter, however, merely expresses support for the U.S.
policy since 1967, which has been in favor of a united Jerusalem.
   Bush wrote: ``It is also our view that the final status of this
most special of cities should be decided by negotiation, and that
this negotiation would be facilitated if we were well along the
path toward peace. There is thus no intention on our part to focus
now on the final status of Jerusalem.''

<TEXT>
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has
assured nervous East Germans that their savings will be converted
one-to-one into hard West German marks in a reunified Germany.
   East German citizens currently get only about 0.16 West German
marks for their currency at a western bank, a 6-1 ratio reflecting
the relative weakness of the East German economy.
   Kohl's promise Tuesday night during a campaign visit appeared
timed to rally support for a conservative three-party alliance
competing in East Germany's free elections Sunday.
   The alliance is heavily backed by Kohl's Christian Democratic
Union in Bonn. It is facing a challenge from the revamped Communist
Party, campaigning on the idea that East Germany's social safety
net and full employment are endangered by a hasty takeover by West
German capitalists.
   Kohl's promise is no guarantee because the currency plan would
require formal approval by his coalition government and the assent
of the West German central bank. In addition, details of the
planned unification still have to be negotiated by the two Germanys.
   Kohl's government is pushing for merging the weak East German
mark with its West German counterpart, one of the world's strongest
currencies.
   Among the thorniest issues in the proposed monetary union, which
would be a prerequisite for full unity, is how to treat East German
savings. Many East Germans, like their counterparts in other Soviet
bloc nations, have compiled large savings because there have been
few consumer goods to buy.
   Kohl's assurance echoed similar statements by members of his
government.
   In his speech in Cottbus, East Germany, he also reiterated a
call for speedy movement toward unity under Article 23 of the West
German Constitution. The clause allows individual East German
states to decide to join West Germany.

<HEAD>Airliner Blows Tires In High-Speed Emergency Landing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Eastern Airlines DC-9 forced to make a
high-speed emergency landing because of a hydraulic system failure
blew all four main landing gear tires and slid off a runway in a
shower of sparks.
   No injuries were reported in the landing at Hartsfield Atlanta
International Airport.
   Airport spokesman John Braden said Eastern Flight 129 returned
to the airport for the emergency landing about 10:50 p.m. Tuesday
after taking off on a flight to Tallahassee, Fla.
   Because the jet landed ``well above normal speed,'' its four
main tires _ two under each wing _ blew and the aircraft skidded
off the runway in a shower of sparks, said Eastern spokesman Jim
Ashlock.
   ``We probably wouldn't have had any situation at all if he
hadn't blown those tires,'' he said.
   The landing was at a higher-than-normal speed because the
hydraulic failure left the DC-9 without flaps, which are used to
slow the plane during descent, Ashlock said.
   Braden said the sparks were caused by the landing gear scraping
the runway, and there was no fire. Emergency crews and fire trucks
lined the runway, but they did not lay down fire-suppressing foam
before the landing.
   The airplane carried 49 passengers and five crew members,
Ashlock said.
   ``The landing was kind of bumpy, and then it was eerie,'' said
passenger Rusty Nunn of Hopkinsville, Ky. ``Of course, everyone was
nervous, but they remained calm.''
   Ashlock said the plane was 25 minutes into its 35-minute flight,
but the pilot elected to return to Atlanta because of its longer
runways and better emergency equipment.
   Braden said the Federal Aviation Administration and the National
Transportation Safety Board would investigate.

<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle suggested today
the Bush administration might consider a loan to Argentina once the
country concludes negotiations to meet economic progress conditions
set by the International Monetary Fund.
   Quayle also said during a news conference that President Bush
may visit Argentina next fall. ``There is a very serious
consideration'' being given to such a visit, he said.
   The IMF appoved a $1.4 billion loan to Argentina last September
but has held up disbursement of the money because President Carlos
Menem did not meet targets on controlling inflation and reducing
the budget deficit.
   ``I communicated to President Menem and others that the United
States will be full partners in the development of Argentina and
other countries in the Western Hemisphere,'' Quayle said.
   The vice president was asked about persistent rumors that the
United States is considering a $400 million bridge loan for
Argentina.
   ``Before we discuss the bridge loan, there would have to be a
`bridge' to something. That something is the conclusion of the IMF
financial arrangement. We did talk in very specific terms about
concluding the IMF package. I believe that ... the government of
Argentina and the IMF are quite close on this and we hope that it
would be resolved very soon,'' Quayle said.
   Quayle left for Brazil, where he will attend the inauguration on
Thursday of President Fernando Collor de Mello, after meeting with
Argentine business leaders and laying a wreath at the statue of
Jose de San Martin, who led the independence struggles of
Argentina, Peru and Chile.
   Menem and Quayle also talked about Cuba, and Menem said he would
try to press President Fidel Castro into making democratic reforms
in his Marxist nation. Castro will attend the inauguration in
Brazil.
   ``We're not going to meet with Castro (in Brazil),'' Quayle told
reporters. ``I have no desire to meet with Fidel Castro. Castro
remains isolated. I had talks with the other leaders, presidents of
this hemisphere, and they have conveyed to me the sense of
isolation that Fidel Castro now finds himself in. Castro must back
change, and sooner or later change will come to Cuba. I am
convinced of that.''
   Quayle asked Menem to also try to get Castro to halt arms
shipments to the leftist rebels in El Salvador. The rebels have the
strongest insurgent movement in Latin America, and are waging war
on the U.S.-backed government of Alfredo Cristiani.
   U.S. officials said earlier that Quayle was encouraging Menem to
take severe austerity measures to curb surging inflation, but was
offering no aid.
   Menem told Quayle on Tuesday that he was putting teeth in his
vow to make economic reforms and restore his country's credibility
internationally, said one Quayle aide who briefed reporters on
condition of anonymity. Argentina has been experiencing inflation
of about 70 percent a month.
   Since taking office last July, Menem has lifted controls on
wages, prices, foreign exchange and investment. He has reduced the
fiscal budget, partly deregulated the oil industry, lowered import
tariffs and pledged to sell a string of money-losing companies.
   However, the measures have failed to control the inflation that
has bedeviled the country, registering triple digits in 14 of the
past 15 years.
   ``He has to cut government. He has to fire government employees.
He needs to do what he says (he will do),'' said one U.S. official
traveling with Quayle.
   The country's economic straits, including shrinking of real
wages by as much as 50 percent in the past year, have prompted
looting of food stores, strikes against national banks, an ongoing
teacher strike and a strike by clerks that disrupted the federal
court system.

   The man who led a 13-month interim
government after the U.S. invasion of 1983 emerged today as
Grenada's likely new prime minister after parliamentary elections.
   Nicholas Brathwaite's centrist National Democratic Congress fell
one seat short of a legislative majority in Tuesday's balloting,
but most observers expected him to be able to persuade at least one
legislator to switch to his party to form a government.
   ``We have a situation where there will have to be negotiations,
which I would have preferred not to have,'' Brathwaite, 64, said
early today. ``But at the same time, I think it is not a difficult
situation.''
   Complete but unofficial results gave the National Democratic
Congress seven of the 15 seats in the House of Representatives,
Grenada's Parliament.
   With one more seat, Brathwaite would have an eight-seat majority
and he held talks early today with other legislators about
switching to his party.
   The Grenada United Labor Party of Sir Eric Gairy, the eccentric
former prime minister deposed in a leftist coup in 1979, was second
with four seats.
   Gairy, 68, who dominated Grenada's politics for nearly three
decades before his ouster, lost his bid for a parliamentary seat.
But his party, with the second most legislators, will likely form
the official opposition, and he could still play a role behind the
scenes.
   The National Party of acting Prime Minister Ben Jones and the
New National Party led by Keith Mitchell, a former Cabinet
minister, won two seats each. Jones and Mitchell were both returned
to Parliament.
   The leftist Maurice Bishop Patriotic Movement failed to gain any
parliamentary seats.
   Radio Grenada said the results were complete but unofficial.
   Official results, along with the popular vote totals, were to be
announced later today.
   It was the second election since U.S. troops, along with a token
regional force, invaded the tiny Caribbean island and toppled a
Marxist junta, and there had been concern over the possible
destabilizing effect of a Gairy victory.
   Gairy, the first prime minister after independence from Britain
in 1974, has been dogged by allegations of corruption and
repression throughout his career. As early as 1961, Britain
dissolved his pre-independence government because of allegations of
financial irregularities.
   Though nearly blind with glaucoma, Gairy had spoken of the
possibility of a ``miracle'' cure and had declared his campaign
divinely inspired.
   The election happened to fall on the 11th anniversary of the
Marxist coup that toppled Gairy's authoritarian regime and brought
to power Bishop's People's Revolutionary Government.
   Bishop and 10 others were assassinated Oct. 19, 1983 following a
split in his government. Six days later, the U.S.-led invasion
force landed and evicted the junta that had seized power. U.S.
officials said the invasion was necessary to protect American lives
and prevent Grenada from becoming a staging post for Communist
aggression in the region.
   Brathwaite, an educator with no political experience at the
time, was called on to head the government during the 13-month
period between the invasion and the election in December 1984.
   Before the last election, the Reagan administration pressured
three centrist parties to merge into the New National Party led by
the late Prime Minister Herbert Blaize, mainly to block Gairy.
   Blaize won 14 seats but the piecemeal party had disintegrated by
the time of his death in December at the age of 71.

<HEAD>Fewer Than Two of Three Americans Favor Lunar Base and Mars
Missions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Approval of the United States space program is
at an all-time high, but fewer than two out of three Americans
favor the lunar base and Mars missions proposed by President Bush,
according to a survey released today.
   Eighty percent of the American people favor the space program,
said the nationwide telephone poll of 1,200 registered voters
conducted by Market Opinion Research. The poll was commissioned by
Rockwell International Corporation, one of the biggest aerospace
manufacturers and builder of the space shuttles.
   The survey, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.8
percent, showed approval rating of the space program continuing to
rise from 56 percent in May 1978. The space station, which is
entering the building phase, was favored by 74 percent of those
polled, up from 69 percent last March. The National Aero-Space
plane, still on the drawing boards, is favored by 70 percent, up
from 57 percent last year.
   On the 20th anniversary last July of man's first landing on the
moon, Bush outlined a goal of returning to the moon and sending
manned expeditions to Mars early in the next century. Only 64
percent of the poll respondents favored the lunar proposal and only
62 percent favored going to Mars.
   While 85 percent of the respondents believe it is important that
the United States take the lead in developing new technologies for
those programs and for monitoring the environment, only 56 percent
agreed that the government should spend ``whatever is necessary''
to maintain its position of leadership.

<HEAD>Report: Covenant House Program Plagued With Drugs and Violence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials at the embattled Covenant House
shelter program ltolerated crime and drug and alcohol use in a
program they considered a model for training and counseling
disturbed young people, a newspaper reported today.
   Youngsters allegedly beat girlfriends, extorted from roommates
and robbed merchants without being kicked out of the Rights of
Passage program, New York Newsday reported, citing internal memos
and employees.
   Newsday reported that a female counselor in the Rights of
Passage program had sex with female clients for months before being
suspended recently. The newspaper said drinking and drug use were
rampant in the program, and youths encouraged girlfriends and
buddies to use Covenant House as a flophouse.
   Covenant House is the country's largest organization providing
shelters for runaways. It started Rights of Passage, an 18-to-24
month training and counseling program, partly to answer criticism
that the organization was warehousing rather than counseling
runaways.
   Program Director Bruce Henry told Newsday that the program has
been ``a phenomenal success'' precisely because there are no rigid
rules, and that clients are treated on a case-by-case basis.
   ``A great many of our kids have disturbances when they come, but
they are drug-free. They are, however, 20-year-old street kids and
they exhibit all the problems they come in with,'' Henry said.
   Covenant House has been plagued in recent weeks by accusations
of financial and sexual misconduct by its founder, the Rev. Bruce
Ritter. The priest resigned as director Feb. 27.
   The Village Voice, a weekly newspaper, reported today that
Ritter gave more than $200,000 in Covenant House contracts to his
niece and her husband.
   Ellen Wallace Lolland was given the contract to decorate and
furnish Covenant House centers nationwide; her husband, Tandy,
managed multimillion-dollar construction and remodeling contracts,
the Voice said.
   Stanley Arkin, Ritter's lawyer, said the Lollands got the
contracts because they submitted the lowest bids. He suggested Mrs.
Lolland's interest in her uncle's work led them to charitably bid
low and even return some proceeds to Covenant House as donations.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers
throughout the country.
   March 9
   Statesman Journal, Salem, Ore., on the Bush transportation plan:
   When candidate George Bush said, ``Read my lips _ no new
taxes,'' we didn't know exactly what he meant. As President George
Bush, he has spelled it out: He'll pass federal duties on to local
governments and let them pay the bill and raise the taxes.
   That's what he and Congress already have done with education and
health care, and it's what he proposes in his new ``Moving America
Into the 21st Century'' plan for our transportation system.
   The federal government would continue paying the costs for
interstate and many major highways, but it would give states and
local governments the bill for building and maintaining millions of
miles of other highways. And it would impose extensive user fees
for motorists, truckers, air travelers and mass transit customers.
   This is a tax increase by another name. It's a tax increase that
local governments cannot pay and probably should not have to pay
for a transportation system that is national in scope. ...
   At the least, Washington should deal with us honestly. If our
crumbling and clogged highways are a national problem, remedy it
with a national program and admit that federal taxes must be
increased, or that other programs must be cut back to save the
money.

   The Providence (R.I.) Journal-Bulletin on the Bush
transportation plan:
   As many travelers know, parts of America's transportation
network have fallen on hard times. Many highways and bridges are
crumbling under heavy traffic; major airports are choked with
congestion; passenger rail service is scattered and spotty, and
urban mass transit is often a joke.
   The Bush administration has dug bravely into this thicket of
problems. Its new transportation policy ... represents a sharp
departure from past practice. It seeks essentially to shrink the
federal role in everything from highway maintenance to mass transit
operations, and to transfer many costs to state and local
governments. ...
   (I)n a nation the size of the United States, transportation is a
national concern deserving national treatment. It is by no means
assured that transferring large pieces of this responsibility to
local governments is the best way to restore our battered system to
health.

   Los Angeles Times on the Rostenkowski deficit reduction plan:
   For most Americans, the national debt is as abstract as the
numbers that measure it _ currently about $3,000,000,000,000, as in
trillion. ...
   Getting Washington to focus again on the debt is only one reason
to cheer Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways
and Means Committe, for his bold plan to slash the federal budget
deficit. ...
   The more than $150 billion a year that vanishes into interest
payments means that there is much less money in circulation for
private investment and, in turn, economic expansion and job
creation. This debt is of increasing consequence as the economy
slows down because it severely cuts the nation's ability to bail
itself out of a severe recession.
   Rostenkowski's plan would not wipe out the national debt but
would keep it from growing after 1994. ...
   Where would the money come from? A one-year freeze on
cost-of-living increases in all federal programs would cut the
deficit by 9 percent the first year. Higher taxes on oil, tobacco,
alcohol and industrial pollutants would cut it another $20 billion.
Cutting the Pentagon budget by 3 percent a year would convert
another $10 billion from red ink to black. Families with incomes
above $185,000 a year, who now pay income taxes as a 28 percent
rate, would pay the same 33 percent that families with smaller
incomes pay. ...
   (T)he White House and some Republican leaders in Congress
resisted any temptation to attack the plan. ... That, plus renewed
attention to the deficit, is an improvement over recent behavior on
all sides.

   Kennebec Journal, Augusta, Maine, on clean air legislation:
   Twenty years after the Clean Air Act was first passed, the ...
Senate majority leader (George Mitchell) has clinched a deal to
overhaul and strengthen it.
   Following 12 days of closed-door meetings, Mitchell unveiled a
compromise which the Bush administration supports, business is
grumbling about, and some environmental groups are wild about. In
the most purple prose, Mitchell is said to have ``gutted'' the bill.
   That's nonsense. Mitchell knows that after a decade of inaction,
begun with the inauguration of Ronald ``Trees Cause Pollution''
Reagan, the nation has got to get a new clean air bill on the books.
   To be sure, there are disappointments. Pollution reduction
techniques for cars and trucks _ contributing perhaps half of all
ozone pollution _ are highly developed. But the technology has not
been used sufficiently, thanks largely to Reagan. This time out,
Bush's proposal for alternative fuel vehicles was cut, as were the
most stringent ``tailpipe'' standards.
   On the other hand, the acid rain-fighting measures, cracking
down on high sulfur coal burning in the Midwest, are mostly intact.
The most punitive sanctions for cities exceeding federal pollution
standards _ shutting down all development _ aren't going to be used
anyway, so their loss is mostly symbolic.
   All in all, Mitchell has done well. Any comparison with the
Clean Air Acts of 1970 and 1990 shows some major improvements, long
overdue. Mitchell's critics ought to remember that the deadlock of
Reagan years, where a president stubbornly refused to acknowledge
scientific reality, is unlikely to recur. If this doesn't work, the
law can be changed again. But it's still a big step forward, the
first in a long, long time.

   The Santa Fe (N.M.) New Mexican on the clean air bill:
   The New Clean Air Act has finally come to the floor of the U.S.
Senate. But the legislation is like the senior prom _ a lot of
people are unhappy with their date. Expectations were too high and
now everyone's got some gripe with the bill.
   It's true that in a perfect world the bill would be tougher with
respect to cleaning up urban smog and laying the groundwork for
reducing air pollution health hazards of the future. But we don't
live in a perfect world, and compromise is the order of the day in
Congress.
   The bill nonetheless requires cuts in harmful sulfur dioxide
emissions by 10 million tons by the year 2000 and caps emissions
thereafter. It also requires tough new smog standards, focusing on
automobile emission controls. Unfortunately, its alternative fuel
provisions are weaker than they ought to be, resulting from Bush
administration backpedaling. It's possible this can be strengthened
with amendments on the Senate floor.
   But whatever its flaws, the overall concept of this legislation
is a major step forward. It should be passed so the real work can
begin. Holding it up is like holding your breath _ in the end,
you've got to breathe the air, and it will be better with the
compromise legislation than without it.

   St. Cloud (Minn.) Times on the defense budget:
   There's a lot of talk in these ``post Cold War'' days about a
so-called peace dividend. The politicians and special interest
groups are lined up, waiting to claim the money they believe should
be diverted from the U.S. defense budget.
   Certainly the Bush administration and Congress would be wise to
consider the possibility of cutting military expenditures in some
ares _ especially if arms control talks between the two superpowers
continue to move ahead.
   But a wholesale slash in U.S. military personnel, equipment and
maintenance would be folly. Even if reforms that have swept across
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union continue. Even if Central
American nations carry off their precarious conversions to
democracy. Even if worldwide relations are comfortably stable. Even
when peace reigns, this country needs a strong military.
   The dividends of peace can be realized without making rash
reductions in personnel and equipment. They can be found, instead,
in conversion. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney _ undoubtedly a man
driven these days by a need to justify his department's strength _
has the right idea. (Two weeks ago), the Pentagon announced a
significant expansion in use of warships, aircraft and
communications equipment against what many Americans consider their
greatest enemy _ illegal drugs.
   The move is an example of how American's military power can be
put to ``nontraditional'' uses. Adjusting priorities is wiser than
eradicating large hunks of our defense _ at least at this point.

   The News and Observer, Raleigh, N.C., on the National Guard and
drugs:
   When the ... National Guard is called out to protect and assist
the citizenry ... it bolsters law enforcement and the public's
feeling that all is under control. But the planned involvement of
the Guard in the drug war, in searching air and sea cargo and in
riding with local law enforcement officers, goes too far.
   It follows, unfortunately, the mentality of too many leaders in
the anti-drug fight _ that the fight is to be won on some
figurative battlefield with muscle and bullets and prisons instead
of in the classroom and the treatment ward. Under that mentality,
the right of citizens to be free of unreasonable searches, for
example, already is under strain. How much more intimidating would
the authorities conducting those searches be if backed by the
firepower of the Guard?
   Ostensibly, the Guard is only to assist civilian law enforcement
agencies _ helping Customs inspectors with cargo searches. ...
There's a fine line, however, between low-key assistance and a
high-profile strong arm. ...
   The stresses of combat, for which the Guard does train people,
are different from those that arise in maintaining law and order in
a community. The National Guard cannot and should not train people
for both possibilities. In the drug war, the Guard's place is not
on the front lines.

   The Phoenix Gazette on the Postal Service:
   In recent years, the U.S. Postal Service has eliminated Sunday
mail sorting, slashed window hours at local post offices and, most
recently, cut back on one-day delivery.
   Having thus been blessed by a reduction in services, the
American people can now look forward to another increase in prices.
   Postmaster General Anthony Frank announced that a 30-cent stamp
seems likely for first-class mail next year.
   Unfortunately, the Postal Service has a government-sanctioned
monopoly over daily mail delivery. When forced to compete, the
Postal Service has been clobbered by the competition.
   Consumers voted with their parcels when United Parcel Service
got into the parcel business. The Postal Service now carries less
than 10 percent of all parcels shipped by the public. The same is
true for Express Mail. The Postal Service's share of
overnight-delivery mail has declined to less than 10 percent.
   The Postal Service managed to operate about $404 million in the
black for the first quarter of this fiscal year, but the agency
expects a record $1.6 billion deficit for the full year ending
Sept. 30.
   The Postal Service claims that it has to preserve its monopoly
so that it can be a ``public service,'' but being a monopoly
destroys the service incentive.
   It has been suggested that deregulating the delivery of
third-class mail would greatly expand the network of private mail
deliverers and create pressure to abolish the first-class mail
monopoly.

   The News and Courier, Charleston, S.C., on the Soviet Union:
   (Mikhail) Gorbachev never has been unwilling to take the plunge
to a market economy principally because of his desire to seek
Marxist-Leninist answers to the country's ills.
   But the recent explosions of ethnic and regional animosities in
Azerbaijan, Armenia and Turkistan, and the growing separatist
movements in the Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania,
have served only to make ... Gorbachev even more reluctant to bite
the bullet and embrace market solutions.
   As a result, shortages of every conceivable item from food to
fuel have become more severe. There are, simply, too many rubles
chasing too few goods at fixed artificial prices, and the result is
a populace that is hungry, angry and increasingly alienated by ...
Gorbachev's promise to cleave to the Leninist path.
   (Radical Soviet politician Boris) Yeltsin, as his showings in
the last three elections have demonstrated, has proved a master at
tapping the deep undercurrent of unrest in the Soviet Union. ``This
is the last chance for the party,'' he told a cheering crowd in
Moscow recently. ``This is also Gorbachev's last chance. Either he
acts or he loses us.''
   Tough words. But ... Yeltsin has demonstrated that he has more
than enough popular muscle to back them up.

   Daily American Republic, Poplar Bluff., Mo., on the Bureau of
Indian Affairs:
   The Bureau of Indian Affairs is like the Soviet economy: It's
forever being repaired but never gets fixed. A new Senate committee
report details the agency's record of waste, corruption and
mismanagement.
   Indian preferences in contracting have spawned Indian-front
companies. The Senate's two-year study found that 19 of the largest
contractors are fronts for non-Indian businesses. Abuse is the norm
rather than the exception in loan programs, management of Indian
trust funds, procurement, computer services and road construction.
Tribal resources the bureau is charged with protecting have been
stolen or neglected. ...
   The Senators note that the agency has been reformed 42 times.
That's more than enough perestroika. It's time for drastic action.
Abused in so many ways for so many years, our native Americans
deserve nothing less than a complete overhaul of this entrenched
and corrupt sub-bureaucracy.

   The Sun Herald, Biloxi, Miss., on better food labeling:
   We agree wholeheartedly with Louis W. Sullivan's description of
the American supermarket as a ``Tower of Babel'' as far as food
labeling is concerned and we support his announced intention of
reforming labeling regulations.
   While Americans have become more conscious of nutritional
requirements and the importance of healthy eating habits, food
labels have become increasingly confusing and deceptive. What's
``low fat'' to one food producer is something else to a competitor.
What ``high fiber'' means on one cereal box isn't the same as it is
on the box next to it.
   Unfortunately, Food and Drug Administration officials estimate
it will be two years before reforms are in place and consumers will
benefit from them. As Secretary of Health and Human Services,
Sullivan ought to use his position to shorten that period.

   The Waukesha County Freeman, Waukesha, Wis., on farmers:
   It is high time to defend the poor farmer.
   Worse than plummeting land values, worse even than losing the
family farm, the farmer's image, in this age of images, has
suffered an unfair beating at the uncallused hands of ersatz
sophisticates and rude lampooners ... at least.
   Continuing to receive wide currency is the notion that farmers
are bucolic dopes trapped in the past. The notion is profoundly
bogus.
   What's really past tense here is the perverted image of a dour,
pitch-fork-wielding dirt farmer _ an animal husband _ whose days
are divided between shoveling feed into one end of a cow and
scooping up the processed feed at the other end and then completing
the sod-bound cycle by sprinkling it back on the ground in time for
the next planting.
   In fact and in truth, the modern farmer is just that _
thoroughly modern. Some might even say ``slick.''
   Just to survive along the fat red edge of financial existence,
farmers must spend incredible amounts of money on the best
available technology.
   It's not just that the tractors are bigger and more complicated,
air-conditioned even. There are other machines as well. And the
computer has come to the farm in force.
   The modern farmer shovels data and lets a machine mind the
manure.
   The roadside veggie stand has been replaced by the world market.
   Hybrids, hormones and genetics are the stuff of the modern farm.
   Yes, it's true that some have complained about library taxes
being unjust to the farmer because ``cows can't read'' _ but that
is really another example that farmers are getting more
sophisticated: What a marvelous public relations gimmick _
illiterate cattle! Who but a farmer could have thought of it?
   Thus, while we agree with the good intentions of the proponents
of modernity, we cringe when we hear our friends and allies
besmirched with derogatory adjectives such as ``small-town,''
``hicksville'' and ``farmer-type.''
   And so it is time to give the farmer a break, to cease casting
farmers as unenlightened saps and to look elsewhere for our
rhetorical buffoons.
   Candidates abound. It needn't be a lengthy search.

   An unidentified gunman shot
and killed a white riot control officer in the central Natal
province today, and three blacks were killed in widespread unrest
in the nation's black areas.
   Top police commanders flew by helicopter to the Hammarsdale area
in central Natal province, and a massive search began for the
gunman who police suspect shot the officer from a distance, the
South African Press Association reported.
   Police Lt. Bala Naidoo said the officer was discovered alone in
his police car with gunshot wounds to the head, neck and shoulder.
   He said the attack occurred close to an overhead bridge and that
the shots came through the passenger window.
   Two black police officers were killed in the same area Feb. 25,
but a similar manhunt was not undertaken.
   Speaking before the shooting, Maj. Gen. Herman Stadler, the
police public relations chief, attributed the recent upsurge in
unrest to political rivalries, socio-economic factors, crime and
the ``euphoria of freedom.''
   At least 200 people, mostly blacks, have been killed in unrest
throughout South Africa in the last month. For the most part, the
violence has been confined to black areas of the country.
   The escalating voiolence has coincided with President F.W. de
Klerk's legalization of 60 outlawed organizations and the freeing
of African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela after 27 years
in prison.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said in a Tuesday address to
parliament that ``radicals and revolutionaries who boast of victory
and dream of a power takeover are in for the shock of their lives.''
   Three blacks were killed in unrest reported today, including one
black who was shot and killed by police and two who were killed in
clashes between black groups.
   Police said 39 people, including 7 police officers were wounded
in the unrest.
   They said one officer was stabbed and six were injured by
stone-throwers.
   Police said 37 people were arrested in scattered incidents.
   A police report released today listed 14 attacks on police or
their homes. The report said blacks used stones and gasoline bombs,
and in one case iron pipes in the attacks.
   Most of the incidents mentioned in the report took place today
or Tuesday night, but some of the attacks took place Sunday night
or Monday and were first reported today.

<TEXT>
   President Fidel Castro of Cuba said his
hard-line Communist government guarantees the independence of Latin
American nations against U.S. domination.
   ``If Cuba falls, the United States will treat Latin American
leaders not as leaders nor as presidents, but with less respect
than American mayors,'' Castro told 50,000 students gathered to
hear him late Tuesday. Cuba's official Prensa Latina, monitored in
Mexico City, carried Castro's remarks.
   The president spoke at a celebration marking the 33rd
anniversary of a botched attack on the presidential palace by
militant students who hoped to depose former dictator Fulgencio
Batista.
   In 1959, Castro led the popular uprising that toppled Batista.
   ``Cubans will defend their revolution like children defend their
parents,'' Castro said, adding that Cuba's government would ``never
fall.''
   Castro said Latin American leaders are afraid of what might
happen should Cuba's government fall. He did not elaborate.
   The Cuban leader has found himself increasingly isolated as
Communist governments have tumbled in Eastern Europe and the Soviet
Union has expressed irritation with Castro's rigid Marxism. Castro
has said his country will stick to orthodox communism even if
Moscow ends all financial support.

<HEAD>Imports Sparking Angry Response From Farmers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers have plowed up their fields
and left crops to rot to protest an influx of cheap foreign
products that is forcing down domestic prices.
   Radish growers in a southern region this week drove tractors
over their fields and have threatened to crush nearly half their
crops. Government officials promised compensation and launched an
``eat-more-radish'' campaign, but consumers appeared to be largely
ignoring it.
   Local newspapers reported Wednesday that heaps of discarded
pears have begun dotting orchards in a southern pear-growing area,
as growers opt to destroy their crops rather than put up with
further price decreases for their products.
   In recent years, farmers have staged sometimes violent
demonstrations against imported products. The United States, which
pressured South Korea to open its agricultural market, often is
singled out by farmers.
   South Korea's importation of foreign agricultural products in
1989 was $6.67 billion, up 16.8 percent from 1988. The imports
included items such as peanuts and grapes, which in the past were
major sources of income for domestic farmers.
   As a result, many South Korean farmers have been forced to turn
to less lucrative crops such as radishes.
   In addition, negotiations are under way between U.S. and South
Korean officials over a U.S. request to further open the South
Korean beef market.
   Thousands of farmers and cattle growers battled riot police in
1988 when the government first relaxed controls on beef imports.
   Officials of the Agriculture Ministry said about $150 million in
subsidies have been set aside to help farmers. The nation's
quarantine requirements also will be strengthened in an effort to
curb imports, they said.

   Vietnamese army surgeons removed the
unexploded head of an M-79 rocket shell from a farmer's arm in ``an
extremely tense'' operation, the official Vietnam News Agency said.
   Hoang Minh Son, 36, was working in a field in the central
province of Thua Thien-Hue on Feb. 22 when his hoe struck the
U.S.-made shell. It detonated and sent the egg-size head into the
farmer's left arm.
   In a report dated Tuesday and seen in Bangkok on Wednesday, the
agency quoted explosives and ballistics experts as saying that ``it
was too risky to tamper with the shell head as it might explode at
the slightest displacement,'' so immediate surgery was required.
   The operation was performed Feb. 26 at a military hospital in
the provincial capital of Hue. Two surgeons ``volunteered for the
job,'' the news agency reported.
   The head surgeon ``skillfully took the shell out of the victim's
arm and transfered it to a bomb disposal squad,'' said the report.
   It did not say where the shell came from, but unexploded rounds
left over from the Vietnam War have killed or maimed many people in
Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia since the fighting ended in 1975.
   Fierce, bloody battles raged throughout Hue, the ancient
imperial capital, when the Communists attacked and occupied the
city in the pivotal Tet offensive of early 1968.

<TEXT>
   A subway train traveling in the wrong direction
during rush hour nearly rammed head-on into a crowded stationary
train, but quick thinking by a conductor prevented a crash, the
London Underground said Wednesday.
   The driver of the non-moving train reached out his window and
pulled together two low-voltage wires on the tunnel wall to
short-circuit the electricity supply, said Neil Howard, a spokesman
for the Underground.
   This brought the moving train to a stop, only 400 feet from the
other train, Howard said. It was traveling at about 20 mph.
   The incident occurred at 6 p.m. Monday on the Piccadilly Line
branch of the subway system. John Robson, the driver of the
stationary train, said Wednesday he was ``slightly shocked'' when
he saw the headlights coming toward him on the same track.
   ``All I could think to do was to open the cab door and pull the
emergency wires to bring him to a halt,'' he said.
   Robson said when he turned around, all the passengers had fled
the first car of his train.
   ``Who can blame them? They must have heard what I said over the
radio to my control that a train had been approaching from the
front,'' he said. There were about 800 commuters crowded onto
Robson's train.
   London Underground has begun an investigation, said Howard.
   Spokeswoman Jocelyn Baker said the near-accident was the result
of human error but that no decision has been made whether to take
disciplinary action.
   She said staff have been working ``around the clock'' installing
50 red lights at crossover points in the system to prevent drivers
from going the wrong way into tunnels.
   She said the driver of the empty train should have gone south
after letting off his passengers. Instead, he switched to the car
at the other end of the train and started traveling north on the
southbound track.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rosamond Lehmann, whose novels of love, betrayal
and family rivalries were critically acclaimed from the 1920s to
the 1950s and republished decades later, has died, her family
announced Wednesday. She was 89.
   No cause of death was stated for Ms. Lehmann, who died Monday at
her home in London.
   Her first novel, ``Dusty Answer,'' won immediate fame for the
young author when it was published in 1927. The novel, about a
young girl's development from childhood to maturity, was praised
for its candor, wit, psychological insight and lyrical, sensuous
quality of writing.
   She followed this with ``A Note of Music'' in 1930, ``Invitation
to the Waltz'' in 1932, ``The Weather in the Streets'' in 1936,
``The Ballad and the Source'' in 1944 and ``The Gypsy's Baby,'' a
collection of short stories, in 1946.
   Her next book was ``The Echoing Grove,'' about the relationship
between two sisters and the man who is married to one and the lover
of the other.
   With shifts of time and approach, the same incidents in the book
are seen through the eyes of different people.
   The book was written after the bitter breakup of Ms. Lehmann's
love affair with the poet Cecil Day Lewis, and critics said it
carried clear traces of that time in her life.
   The soft-voiced author grew up in a large, comfortable home at
Bourne End on the River Thames near London. She was educated at
Cambridge University.
   She met her first husband, Walter Runciman, who was later to
become Lord Runciman, at Cambridge University. They married in 1923
and were divorced in 1928.
   Later in 1928, she married Wogan Philipps, the eldest son of the
first Lord Milford, the shipping magnate. They had two children,
Hugo and Sally. That marriage ended in divorce in 1944.
   Her grief over the death of her daughter from polio led her to
spiritualism for a time. For many of her later years she was vice
president of the privately funded College of Psychic Studies in
London.
   Toward the end of her life, the Virago Press, which specializes
in publishing work by women, republished many of her novels,
introducing her work to a new generation of readers.
   Queen Elizabeth II awarded Ms. Lehmann the Commander of the
Order of the British Empire in 1982.
   She is survived by her son, Hugo. Funeral services were
scheduled March 19 in London.

<TEXT>
   A 1987 amendment to the Maine
Constitution that says the right to bear arms ``shall never be
questioned'' does not mean felons have the right to own guns, the
state's highest court ruled today.
   ``Plainly, the people of Maine who voted for the amendment never
intended that an inmate at Maine State Prison or a patient in a
mental hospital would have an absolute right to bear a firearm,''
the unanimous Maine Supreme Judicial Court said.
   The justices struck down a ruling from a Superior Court judge
who said last year that the amendment did not prohibit a
non-violent habitual traffic offender, Edward Brown, from owning a
gun.
   ``This is a victory for common sense,'' state Attorney General
James E. Tierney said in Augusta. ``The supreme court has avoided a
hypertechnical reading of the statute.''
   Brown's lawyer, Daniel Bates, was out of town and not
immediately available for comment, a secretary said.
   The amendment approved by voters said ``every citizen has a
right to keep and bear arms; and this right shall never be
questioned.'' It struck out the words ``for the common defense''
from the original right-to-bear-arms provision.
   ``Prior to the 1987 amendment the Maine Constitution afforded no
absolute right to keep and bear arms and we now hold that no
absolute right was created by the amendment,'' today's ruling said.
The justices said ``the evident purpose of the amendment was merely
to transform a collective right to bear arms into an individual
right and nothing more.''
   The justices also said the amendment did not invalidate a state
law prohibiting gun possession by felons.
   ``One who has committed any felony has displayed a degree of
lawlessness that makes it entirely reasonable for the legislature,
concerned for the safety of the public it represents, to want to
keep firearms out of the hands of such a person,'' the justices
said.
   The case had fostered an unusual alliance among the National
Rifle Association, the national Center to Prevent Handgun Violence,
the Sportsman's Alliance of Maine and the Maine Chiefs of Police
Association. All the groups supported the state attorney general's
appeal of the lower court ruling.
   The amendment was prompted by a 1986 Maine supreme court ruling
that upheld the illegal possession of firearms conviction of a
felon who had argued that the Constitution guaranteed his right to
bear arms.
   In that ruling, the justices found that the Constitution
protected the right to bear arms only ``for the common defense.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush toured the power plant that
produces the White House's electricity today and acknowledged that
it will cost utilities ``megabucks'' to comply with his proposed
tougher clean air rules.
   But Bush, speaking outside the Potomac Electric Co.'s Chalk
Point Generating Station, said he was committed to giving industry
flexibility in how to cut back on sulfur dioxide emissions and
other pollution.
   He urged the Senate to pass the compromise version of the Clean
Air Act recently hammered out by Senate leaders and the White House.
   ``We can't let this country screech to a halt, but I am
determined to clean up the air,'' declared Bush.
   ``The bill is consistent with the need to balance environmental
benefits and sustain economic growth for this country,'' said Bush,
standing beside PEPCO President Edward F. Mitchell.
   Bush, who viewed giant twin turbines inside the plant, the
largest in Maryland, said, ``Ed was telling me there's megabucks
involved in all of this.'' He promised the new stricter rules would
be made ``as cost-effective as possible'' with utilities given
maximum flexibility to decide how to meet them.
   The Chalk Point plant, burning coal as well as oil and natural
gas in four units, generates 2,000 megawatts at the sprawling
1,160-acre facility along the Patuxent River, 45 miles outside
Washington. It now meets federal and state pollution standards.
   A PEPCO spokeswoman, Nancy Moses, said the utility estimates it
will cost $12 million a year to bring the plant up to the first
phase of the proposed new clean air standards. Then it will take a
capital investment of $264 million for scrubbers and other
technology plus $36 million a year in higher operating costs to
meet the second phase, she said.
   Bush said PEPCO officials assured him their company ``is
committed to take these additional steps to meet these even tougher
standards. ... For that we're very grateful.''
   Bush also toured the plant's ``Aquaculture Center'' where PEPCO
raises 1 million striped bass or rockfish to replenish the depleted
waters of the nearby Chesapeake Bay.

<HEAD>Romanians Travel to Austria Hours Before Visa Requirement Takes
Effect</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Romanians traveled to
Austria today, many hoping to apply for refugee status only hours
before a new visa requirement takes effect.
   Authorities and angered citizens sought to prevent a possible
flood of refugees, and officials said they had begun turning back
Romanians who were unable to show they had sufficient hard currency
to pay for their stay.
   In the town of Traiskirchen just south of Vienna, where
Austria's main refugee camp is located, residents blocked all main
roads to the town to prevent Romanians from reaching the camp,
which officials said already was filled up with refugees, many from
the East bloc.
   The visa requirement, which goes into effect at midnight, was
enacted by Austrian authorities following heated debates in recent
weeks. Controversy over plans to house 800 Romanian refugees in an
Austrian village of 200 further fueled the discussion.
   According to police in the Austrian border region of Burgenland,
7,000 Romanians entered Austria from Hungary during the night and
early morning.
   Thousands of others _ far more than usual _ headed for the
border, although travelers to Budapest did not notice unusually
heavy traffic heading toward Austria.
   The Burgenland province police director, Johann Schoretits, said
in a telephone interview that border authorities were instructed to
require Romanians entering Austria to prove that they possess
enough hard currency to pay for at least a 14-day stay in Austria,
amounting to about $400, or that they had visas for other countries.
   Romanians who could not show either were turned back, he said.
   In Budapest, a Hungarian border guard official, Janos
Cseh-Nemeth, said Austrian authorities had delayed the ``Orient
Express'' passenger train traveling from the East to Western Europe
and barred entry to about 175 Romanians _ 25 percent of the train's
passengers.
   In Budapest, a border guard spokesman, Lt. Col. Janos Zubek,
said traffic on the Hungarian side of the border was normal.
   But the Austria Press Agency reported that thousands of
Romanians were waiting to enter the country before the visa
requirement goes into effect.
   The Hungarian-Austrian border is no longer divided by barbed
wire and other barriers installed during the Cold War. Hungarian
authorities began removing them last year after democratic reforms,
and tens of thousands of East Germans fled to the West over that
border last summer.
   The exodus of East Germans helped cause the fall of the
hard-line Communist leadership in East Germany and the subsequent
whirlwind of democratic change that swept through Eastern Europe.
   Austria has traditionally been a haven for refugees from Eastern
Europe. Tens of thousands came from Hungary in 1956, when Soviet
troops crushed an anti-Communist uprising, from Czechoslovakia in
1968, when a Soviet-led invasion squelched democratic reforms and
most recently from East Germany.
   The government says most people arriving from Eastern Europe can
no longer be considered political refugees under the Geneva
Convention, following the democratization in those countries.
   The authorities say most East Europeans coming to Austria now
are seeking better living conditions than they could hope for in
the ruined economies left by the ousted Communist leaderships in
their homelands.

   Immigration agents apprehended 45 suspected
illegal aliens today on an Eastern Airlines jet making a stopover
on a flight from Los Angeles to New York.
   Agents found the 45 people from Mexico, Peru, Guatemala, El
Salvador, Colombia, Honduras and Ecuador on Eastern Flight 88, said
Thomas P. Fischer, district director of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service in Atlanta. Three other people were detained
originally but then released.
   ``This may be part of a massive alien smuggling operation, and
our agents will continue to investigate all possible leads to
finally break this large-scale, nationwide operation,'' Fischer
said.
   Agents said the majority of the suspected illegal aliens were
traveling to New York to find jobs.
   Those from Mexico will be taken to Brownsville, Texas, and
returned to Mexico, he said, while the others will be taken to
Miami for processing.
   The roundup at Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport was
similar to one at the airport in February 1989. Then, INS agents
found 79 illegal aliens aboard another Eastern flight from Los
Angeles to New York.
   INS agents said then that they were tipped off to the possible
smuggling operation by a disgruntled businessman who frequently
flew the route.
   The aliens apprehended in 1989 told INS agents they had paid
$900 to $4,000 each to smugglers to get across the border into Los
Angeles and then paid other smugglers for plane tickets to New
York, where they planned to find work or contact relatives.

   Business inventories resumed their slow growth
in January after a one-month decline, the government reported
Wednesday, and analysts said the 0.2 percent gain confirms the
sluggishness in the manufacturing economy.
   The Commerce Department said inventories totaled a seasonally
adjusted $795.9 billion, including a steep 0.7 percent jump in
manufacturing backlogs.
   Inventories as a whole fell 0.4 percent in December, the first
drop since a 0.1 percent decline in October 1988 and the largest
since a 0.6 percent fall in December 1986. The December drop was
originally reported to be 0.2 percent.
   The January report is ``confirming what we already know, that
the area of manufacturing is beginning to slow,'' said economist
Thomas Runiewicz of the WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
   ``We're starting to see rises in paper and chemicals and a lot
of basic commodities that are used daily throughout the whole
manufacturing industry,'' he said. ``What we're seeing is that as
the industry slows down, the demand for commodities slows down.''
   The Commerce Department also reported a 0.3 percent increase in
business sales to a seasonally adjusted $532 billion in January
after falling a revised 0.2 percent in December. December sales
first were reported unchanged from November.
   The January report resulted in a 1.52 ratio of inventories to
sales, the same as December but down slightly from a 1.53 ratio in
both October and November. The ratio means that it would take 1.52
months to exhaust inventories at the January pace.
   Inventories often rise during periods of slow economic growth as
output exceeds demand. If they were to pile up excessively, it
could mean cutbacks in production and a loss of jobs, possibly
leading to a recession.
   But Runiewicz said current inventory levels are not indicative
of negative economic growth.
   ``If anything, when comparing what we've experienced in previous
recessions, we've been able to maintain or get more of a grip on
inventories,'' he said. ``Previous recessions were accompanied by
some inventories becoming out of control.''
   Retail backlogs fell 0.6 percent in January, while sales rose
2.8 percent. Automobile inventories dropped 3.6 percent as auto
manufacturers temporarily laid off thousands of workers during the
month to trim the number of motor vehicles stuck on backlots.
   But while manufacturing inventories grew 0.7 percent, sales
dropped 1.9 percent.
   Wholesalers' inventories advanced 0.2 percent, while their sales
gained 1.4 percent.

   Sammy Davis Jr. has been released from a
hospital and sent home after treatment for a recurrence of throat
cancer, his publicist said.
   ``The initial chemotherapy has been completed. His spirits are
up and he continues to fight,'' said spokeswoman Susan Reynolds.
Davis, 64, was released Tuesday.
   He was first diagnosed as having carcinoma of the throat last
September and was forced to drop out of a concert tour with Liza
Minnelli and Frank Sinatra so he could undergo radiation treatment.
   Davis was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in mid-January
for treatment of a gum infection and doctors later found that he
had a recurrence of throat cancer.
   Ms. Reynolds said no further treatments were planned. ``Right
now the doctors want him to concentrate on building his strength,''
she said.
   Davis, the versatile singer-dancer, most recently appeared in
the 1989 movie ``Tap,'' playing an old-time tap dancer named Little
Mo.

   Mayor David Dinkins says there was a method to
his acting debut: let Dinkins be Dinkins.
   The mayor starred as himself in a cameo role in a new
made-in-New-York action adventure show called ``H.E.L.P.'' The
series is about folks who answer 911 calls and bail people out of a
myriad of urban disasters.
   Dinkins said playing himself was a snap.
   ``I know me well,'' he said.
   The mayor's part called for him to present a medal for bravery
to a heroic firefighter.
   In the role, Dinkins strides into City Hall's Blue Room _ site
of daily mayoral news conferences _ and utters 56 words.
   The mayor was paid union scale, $414, for his 30-minutes work
Tuesday. He said he plans to donate it to the Harlem Junior Tennis
Program, which teaches the sport to indigent youth.
   Director Janet Greek gushed over Dinkins' moonlighting: ``He was
really great.''
   Still, the mayor said he has no plans to give up his day job.

   Two-way wrist TV-radios will still be
tough to find, but this summer's suave man-about-town hunting for
the Dick Tracy look should be able to get the comic book sleuth's
trademark fedora.
   George W. Bollman Co. Inc., a hatmaker in Adamstown, about 20
miles west of Philadelphia, is pinning its hopes on the success of
a new movie about the square-jawed crime fighter. The movie
starring Warren Beatty and Madonna is to be released June 15.
   The company, which claims to be the world's largest maker of
wool felt hats, is busily turning out 40,000 pale yellow hats with
wide black bands. The hats will be shipped to stores next month.
   The company is the sole contractor for Dorfman Pacific, the
Stockton, Calif., firm that owns the license for Dick Tracy hats,
and Bollman hopes they become a fashion craze.
   ``Dick Tracy could be as important as Indiana Jones,'' said
Bollman president Curtis A. Glass.
   After Indiana Jones captured moviegoers' imaginations in
``Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' Bollman sold more than 300,000 hats
styled after the archaeologist's fedora. Several other companies
also made the hats.

   Fire that consumed one wing of a nursing
home killed three patients, officials said today.
   Two firefighters suffered smoke inhalation fighting Tuesday
night's fire, and one was hospitalized, officials said. Forty-three
home residents were also hospitalized, but many of them were being
treated for problems unrelated to the fire, officials said.
   The blaze broke out in the west wing of the two-wing Dardanelle
Nursing Center about 9:30 p.m. and was extinguished two hours
later, said Betty Smith, a police dispatcher in the town 70 miles
west of Little Rock.
   The center had 87 residents.
   Forty-three nursing home patients were kept overnight at three
hospitals, spokesmen said. Twenty-six patients were housed at a
National Guard armory, where the nursing home set up temporary
operations. Some were taken to other nursing homes in the area.
   Sgt. Albert Moats said the patients at the armory were
devastated by the tragedy.
   ``There were a lot of wet eyes here last night,'' Moats said.
``There were a lot of people that were upset. You don't expect it
to happen in our town, something like this.''
   Police Chief Montie Sims said a preliminary investigation by
state fire officials was inconclusive.
   ``It appears from their investigation that the fire started in
and around a living area of the building. As to what the exact
cause is, we don't know,'' he said.
   Authorities did not immediately release the names of the dead.
Yell County Coroner Mike Cornwell said they were two men and a
woman.
   Donald T. Cline, administrator at Dardanelle Hospital, said most
of the 27 people hospitalized there were being treated for medical
problems unrelated to the fire. Four patients, including the
firefighter, were taken to Baptist Medical Center in Little Rock,
where they were in satisfactory condition with smoke inhalation.
One also had burns.
   Thirteen others were at St. Mary's Regional Medical Center in
Russellville, where spokeswoman Cindi Chase said all were in stable
to fair condition. Three people were treated at the hospital and
released, Ms. Chase said.

<HEAD>West Germans Want Nazi Documents Now in U.S. Hands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany is urging the United States to
turn over hundreds of thousands of original Nazi documents, but a
leading Jewish organization said Wednesday it would try to persuade
Congress to stop the move.
   The Berlin Documents Center, in the American sector of West
Berlin, is the biggest repository of Nazi documents in the world.
   A delegation from West Germany held talks with State Department
officials in Washington on March 1-2 about the prospects of
transferring the center, which is run by the State Department,
officials said.
   ``We would be happier if the U.S. government tells us we can
have them (the documents) in the foreseeable future,'' said Henning
Horstmann, a spokesman for the West German Embassy in Washington.
``It is a part of German history.''
   West Germany's parliament, the Bundestag, passed a resolution
last year calling for the center to be turned over as soon as
possible.
   The resolution was given impetus in recent weeks by the moves
underway to unify East and West Germany. Talks began Wednesday in
Bonn among the two Germanys and the four Allied powers with
residual control of Berlin _ the United States, the Soviet Union,
France and England _ about the unification process.
   A unified Germany could result in the withdrawal of the U.S.
presence from Berlin, leaving the fate of the documentation center
uncertain.
   The United States has agreed in principle to hand over the
center to the Germans, but only once the original documents have
all been copied on microfilm, said a State Department official who
spoke on the condition of anonymity. The copies would be brought to
the United States.
   That process, begun several years ago, could be completed by
1994, the official said. But the West Germans want the archives
much sooner than that, said another official, who also asked not to
be named.
   The World Jewish Congress announced it would start a drive in
Congress to prevent the State Department from handing over the
originals. ``This would be a catastrophe if it happened,'' said
Kalman Sultanik, vice president of the organization.
   ``These documents are irreplaceable. Copies can't substitute for
originals,'' he said.
   The center, which houses such items as membership cards in the
Nazi party and dossiers on members of Adolf Hitler's elite SS
units, has been used extensively over the years to prepare
prosecution cases against suspected Nazi criminals in West Germany
and elsewhere in the world. It also serves thousands of scholars of
the Nazi era.
   The Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations, which
makes heavy use of the center to prepare cases against suspected
Nazis, opposes turning over the documents, sources said.
   The OSI cannot rely on microfilmed documents because it often
needs the originals to authenticate copies in court, said the
sources.
   Even if West Germany guarantees access to the documents, the OSI
is worried that that process could mean bureaucratic hassles and
delays, the sources said.
   When the United States handed original documents to Austria in
1955, which included files on Austrian members of the Nazi party
and dossiers on their activities, the records disappeared, the
sources said.
   Austria said the documents were lost but U.S. officials believe
they were destroyed.
   The disappearance came to light during the 1986 investigation of
the Nazi past of Austrian President Kurt Waldheim. In 1987,
Waldheim was barred from entering the United States because of his
alleged involvement in the persecution of Jews and Allied prisoners
of war.

   More tornadoes struck today in Texas, a day after swarms of
tornadoes veered across the Plains and smashed farmhouses while the
East had a second day of a winter heat wave.
   Thunderstorms brought flood warnings today to Oklahoma, Texas,
Illinois, Iowa and Wisconsin. Four to 5 feet of water stood in an
Interstate 43 underpass on Milwaukee's north side.
   ``We're on alert,'' said Milwaukee County emergency director Lev
F. Baldwin. ``Let's face it, there could be some worse problems
today. Rivers and creek beds are all swollen. And if we get this
additional rain we could have some more flooding.''
   Snow was the problem today in Wyoming. Ground blizzards stirred
up by wind gusting to 50 mph forced the Wyoming Highway Patrol to
close a 45-mile stretch of Interstate 80 between Cheyenne and
Laramie. Several jackknifed trucks also contributed to the closure.
   At least two tornadoes caused an undetermined amount of damage
today in central Texas, while wind of more than 50 mph blew over
trailers and highway signs and downed power lines across northern
parts of the state.
   No injuries were immediately reported from a twister which hit
the small community of Mitchell, Texas, south of Hillsboro.
Authorities said another tornado flipped over a mobile home,
uprooted trees and toppled power poles near Belton, Texas.
   ``We have fire trucks en route. There is damage _ to what extent
I do not know,'' said Joe Creamer, a Hill County sheriff's
dispatcher.
   On Tuesday, tornadoes touched down in Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa,
Oklahoma and Texas. At least two people were killed, 29 injured and
scores of houses wrecked.
   ``The damage is about twice of what we thought it was last
night,'' Civil Defense worker Leo Zadina said today of tornado
damage in Lawrence, Neb. He estimated more than 50 houses were
damaged in the town of about 350 people.
   One tornado ripped a 100-mile path in a 2{-hour tear through
southeastern Kansas. It lingered in Hesston, Kan., a town of 3,000
people, long enough to damage 75 to 100 houses. A 6-year-old boy
died. A mother and her teen-age son, originally listed as missing,
were found safe.
   Extensive damage prompted authorities to cordon off the town of
4,000, barricading all roads and guarding heavily damaged
residential areas and businesses. A Highway Patrol officer stood
guard outside the Hesston State Bank, which lost its roof, windows
and part of a wall.
   Kansas Gov. Mike Hayden declared eight counties disaster areas
today.
   Wind flattened several farm buildings in southern Wisconsin.
   Dan Roeske, a fence company worker who rode out the storm in a
metal building about 15 miles south of Madison, said: ``It was like
being inside a drum that someone was banging on.''
   Walnut-size hail fell at Groom, Texas. Wind blew over a trailer
and knocked out power to many residents today at Ennis, about 45
miles south of Dallas.
   The funnel-spinning warm front brought balmy weather to much of
the country east of the Rockies.
   ``I always feel confused when I feel good in the unusually warm
weather we're having nowadays, because I know it's related to the
greenhouse effect,'' said Ellen Spiro, a New York video maker.
   The National Weather Service said the heat came from a
high-pressure system pumping Gulf of Mexico air northward.
   A full week before the first day of spring, summer came to New
York City. The high of 85 was 38 degrees above normal and 15
degrees higher than the 1929 record.
   Lenny and Robin Wayne, tourists from Los Angeles, took a few
spins around the Rockefeller Center ice skating rink and left early.
   ``It's too hot to ice skate,'' Wayne said.
   ``It makes you want to fall on the ice,'' his wife said.
   The warmth was expected to last until Thursday, then ``it'll
just get a little cooler,'' said meteorologist Robert McElhearn.
   Michigan hardware stores that were selling rock salt and snow
shovels two weeks ago shifted gears Tuesday, as customers started
buying fertilizer and seeds. ``But they aren't buying fans yet,''
said Mike Manning, a salesman at Pointe Hardware store in Grosse
Pointe Park.
   Record highs for the date were registered in Atlantic City,
N.J., where it was 86; Baltimore 85; Charlotte, N.C., 86; Chicago
71; Cleveland, 76; Concord, N.H., 69; Detroit 73; Indianapolis 75;
Montgomery, Ala., 85; Norfolk, Va., 84; Philadelphia 84;
Providence, R.I., 77; Raleigh-Durham, N.C. 88; Richmond, Va., 89;
Rochester, Minn., 63; and Washington, D.C., 87.
   In Hesston, the 6-year-old who died was one of seven people
huddled in a basement when the chimney and fireplace crashed
through. The boy's 12-year-old brother was injured.
   The same tornado killed an elderly woman near Goessel, Kan., 10
miles from Hesston, and damaged 19 farmhouses in surrounding Marion
County, said Sheriff Ed Davies.
   Twenty-five National Guardsman were called out Tuesday night to
prevent looting in Hesston, said city administrator Jay Wieland.
The guardsmen or replacements may be used in the cleanup today, he
said.
   At a church in the north Texas town of Elbert, officials
monitoring the gubernatorial primary vote took a breather Tuesday
to watch a tornado.
   ``We just stood in the rain ad watched it go by,'' said election
judge Bernard Gilmore. The twister caused no major damage.
   At least nine Iowa counties were visited by twisters, including
one that destroyed a firehouse, 10 homes and three businesses in
Worthington, near Dubuque. Fifty residents were given shelter by
the Red Cross.
   Tornadoes wrecked part of Lawrence, Neb., injuring three people,
and derailed 24 empty Burlington Northern Railroad cars near Grand
Island.
   Authorities declared a disaster area at Sutton, Neb., after a
twister ruptured a tank of dangerous anhydrous ammonia.
   Meanwhile, up to 8 inches of snow fell late Tuesday in the
Nebraska Panhandle. Snow also blanketed parts of Montana, Idaho,
Arizona and Colorado.

   The two Germanys and the four World
War II Allies formally agreed today to invite Poland to talks on
German unification when that country's western border is discussed.
   The decision came a day after West Germany said Poland, which is
concerned about possible German designs on its territory, could
join discussions on a united Germany's borders.
   The first formal talks on German unification between the six
nations lasted about seven hours. Officials from the two Germanys
and the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain and France held
the one-day talks to lay groundwork for future discussions on
unification, which faces enormous complexities.
   Dieter Kastrup, head of the West German delegation, said the
officials had agreed Poland should be included during some parts of
the talks.
   ``The participants agreed that Poland should be invited as soon
as questions are discussed that especially concern its border,''
Kastrup said.
   The one-day talks are part of the ``two-plus-four'' formula of
unification discussions agreed on last month in Ottawa. There has
not been any announcement on the timing or place of the next round.
   Today's discussions were expected to be mainly procedural. East
Germany is holding its first free elections on Sunday, and there is
uncertainty about who will represent it at the next round of talks.
   After their morning talks, the delegates began a meeting with
West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher.
   Eighteen officials from the six nations began the meeting at an
enormous round table inside the West German Foreign Ministry. No
opening statement was made to reporters.
   West German TV said the officials would discuss alternating the
sites of the next meetings in the capitals of the ``participating
countries.'' The television gave no details.
   The chief East German delegate, Deputy Foreign Minister Ernst
Krabatsch, made a few comments to journalists as he was sitting at
the table.
   He reiterated that East Germany favors the participation of all
concerned nations in unification talks at some level.
   ``We've always favored ... including neighboring countries, all
interested countries, including Poland,'' he said.
   On Tuesday, West Germany said Poland could take part in
discussions on a united Germany's borders, but it remained unclear
whether that meant Poland would actually have a voice in the
six-power talks or whether it would be involved in discussions in
some other way.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany heightened international
jitters by at first refusing to state unequivocally that a united
Germany would not claim lands ceded to Poland after the Third
Reich's defeat in 1945.
   He has since said a united Germany must sign a border treaty
with Poland, but the Poles are not satisfied with his stated
position.
   Kohl has come under intense international scrutiny for trying to
push unification at a pace that has worried the Soviets as well as
some of West Germany's close friends and neighbors.
   During the past few days, Kohl has launched a campaign aimed at
soothing any bad feelings his handling of the unification process
may have created, vowing unity will not occur behind other nations'
backs.
   Volker Ruehe, general secretary of Kohl's Christian Democratic
Union, told reporters Tuesday that unification cannot be completed
``as long as the external questions ... are not settled.''
   Ruehe said unification would likely come ``in steps'' under
Article 23 of West Germany's constitution, which allows for East
German states to decide to join with their western neighbor.
   He also said all-German elections would not be likely until next
year some time, at the earliest.
   Ruehe said that because of enormous complexities, the
unification process may require three or more years to complete.
   Also Tuesday, officials of Kohl's party said it favors drastic
cutbacks on social benefits for East Germans who move to West
Germany in the future.
   More than 130,000 East Germans have resettled in West Germany
this year alone, joining 344,000 who arrived last year.
   Christian Democratic officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said it is possible they may have to face shortened
benefits for a certain period of time.
   West Germany's opposition Social Democrats have already urged
that benefits be curtailed for the resettlers as a means of
discouraging them from leaving their homeland, but up until now
Kohl had opposed such an idea.

<TEXT>
   Forged by the pro-democracy movements that
shook the Soviet bloc last year, East Germany's historic weekend
elections will help set the pace of reunification with West Germany.
   What started with thousands of pro-democracy activists taking to
the streets of Leipzig in September has led to Sunday's nationwide
balloting for a 400-member Parliament.
   Voters in the nation's first free elections are being presented
with a dizzying array of 24 slates of candidates, ranging from
conservatives to radical leftists. In one region, the new Beer
Drinkers' Party is running candidates.
   The once-hardline Communists, struggling for a strong opposition
role, have changed their name, lightened their image and tried to
wipe out the memories of the regime that killed would-be escapees
and crushed dissent.
   But polls show the Communists with 18 percent support or less,
despite the popularity of Communist Premier Hans Modrow.
   ``Now we're out in the open dueling with swords,'' said Jens
Reich, a co-founder of the New Forum opposition movement that led
the fall protests. ``Before it was a slaughter with clubs behind
closed doors.''
   ``What we have accomplished is a more open, democratic
process,'' said Reich, the top candidate for New Forum. ``This
process cannot be reversed.''
   Very few East Germans have tasted true democratic government.
Forty years of iron-fisted Communist rule replaced the Nazi
dictatorship, which followed the chaos of the Weimar Republic.
   Soon after the Berlin Wall was opened Nov. 9, the Leipzig
protesters again took the lead, this time with tens of thousands
chanting ``Germany United Fatherland'' and waving West German flags.
   Almost overnight, the West German conservatives' dream of
reunification loomed as a reality for Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Both Kohl and his detente-minded foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich
Genscher, now routinely attract huge crowds at East German election
rallies.
   ``God bless our German fatherland,'' Kohl says at the end of
each of his campaign speeches, drawing wild cheers.
   International concerns over West Germany's possible claims to
part of Poland may slow down the reunification process. But another
main signal will come from the ballots cast by the 12.3 million
eligible voters.
   Virtually everyone in East Germany agrees that historical
forces, a common language and the ties of kinship make German
reunification inevitable.
   The issue sets the changes in East Germany apart from those in
Hungary, Czechoslovakia and other parts of Eastern Europe that have
undergone pro-democracy movements.
   Now, the main question is ``when,'' made even more pressing by
the continuing exodus of East Germans to the West.
   Communist leader Gregor Gysi, an affable, 42-year-old lawyer, is
trying to block the leftist Social Democrats and the conservatives
from getting a two-thirds majority coalition. That would allow them
to vote for quick reunification.
   Polls suggest that such a broad-based majority is a possibility.
   Gysi has been stumping nationwide _ at one point jumping from an
airplane in a skydiving stunt _ as he attempts to drum up votes and
support for slowing reunification.
   The Communists insist that moving too quickly would mean the end
of the socialist system's cradle-to-grave safety net that for 40
years guaranteed jobs, a place to live and other benefits.
   At a rally Tuesday night in the southeastern town of Freiberg,
Gysi said quick reunification would mean ``the loss of many of the
rights of our citizens, such as property rights, women's rights,
rights of young people and others, things that most people take for
granted now.''
   The party repeatedly has urged against a ``sellout'' to the West.
   But already contracts worth billions of dollars have been signed
between the two German states, though that's only a small fraction
of what is expected to come.
   ``The big fish that's never satisfied wants to swallow the
little fish,'' said West Germany's Der Spiegel magazine in its
latest issue.
   At the same time, even East Germany's Social Democrats are
starting to snipe at Kohl's handling of the reunification issue.
   Kohl heightened international concerns by at first refusing to
state unequivocally a united Germany would not claim lands given to
Poland after the Third Reich's defeat in 1945. He now says a united
Germany must sign a border treaty with Poland, but the Poles are
still not satisfied with his stated position.
   In addition, many Europeans fear that Kohl is allowing the
unification process to distract him from plans for tighter European
integration.
   ``Life punishes whoever goes over to Kohl,'' said Ibrahim
Boehme, chief of the Social Democrats.
   It was a play on words from a Russian proverb used by Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in October, when he tried to urge East
Germany's hard-line leader to make political and economic changes.
   ``Life punishes whoever comes late,'' Gorbachev told Erich
Honecker in his unsuccessful attempt to push reforms.
   Less than two weeks later, the 77-year-old Honecker was ousted
and now faces indictment for high treason.
   ``The chances for survival (of East Germany) are very small,''
said Guenther Buch, a leading West German government expert who
keeps track of East Germany.
   Buch added in an interview with The Associated Press: ``There is
only one reason to have this election, and this is to legitimize
the government so that a decision can be made on unification.
Modrow's government wasn't legitimate.''

<HEAD>Militia Battles in Area Where Hostages Believed Held</HEAD>

   Iran's Shiite Moslem militia allies
battled with rival fighters in the slums of south Beirut on
Wednesday, close to where the Western hostages are believed held.
Police said three people were killed before Syrian soldiers broke
up the battle.
   The fighting lasted five hours between the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God, and the mainstream Shiite Amal militia
in the slums of Shiyah, Ouzai and Bir Hasan.
   The three densely populated districts are a few blocks west of
Hezbollah's Hajjaj and Hay Madi barracks, where most of the 18
Western hostages are believed held by Hezbollah-affiliated
kidnappers.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with
regulations, said Syrian troops moved in and disengaged the
combatants in the afternoon.
   ``The Syrian Arab forces are moving in! We have shoot-to-kill
orders! Any fighter spotted will be shot at!'' shouted a Syrian
captain as he walked down Ouzai's main street, which separates Amal
and Hezbollah fighters.
   Syria has about 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon. They were deployed
in 1976 under a mandate to quell civil war fighting.
   The combatants did not shoot at the Syrian captain, who was
followed by about 50 heavily armed soldiers advancing slowly along
both sides of the street, police said.
   The thuds of exploding rocket propelled grenades and bursts of
machine gun fire, accompanied by the wailing of ambulance sirens,
echoed across west Beirut before the Syrians moved in.
   Fighters of Hezbollah and the Syrian-backed Amal, Arabic for
hope, remained on maximum alert in their respective areas of
influence throughout west and south Beirut, as well as south
Lebanon and the eastern Bekaa valley.
   Witnesses said the rival militias stocked up on ammunition and
weapons.
   The two factions have been fighting on-and-off for more than two
years for control of the 1.2 million Shiites, the largest community
among Lebanon's 17 sects. The latest battles erupted Tuesday.
   Most schools in west Beirut suspended classes Thursday amid
fears fighting would flare again.
   Hundreds of worried parents rushed to schools shortly after the
8:30 a.m. outbreak of clashes and brought their children home.
   Meanwhile, Former President Jimmy Carter arrived in Syria on
Wednesday and said he expected to discuss the plight of foreign
hostages in Lebanon when he meets with President Hafez Assad this
week.
   ``It's obvious to me that the Syrian leaders are very eager to
see the hostage question solved and so see the hostages released,''
Carter told reporters on arrival at Damascus international airport.
   Syria is the main power broker in Lebanon, but most of the
hostages are believed to be held by groups influenced by Iran and
often at odds with Syria.
   The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   In the eastern part of Beirut, rival Christian forces exchanged
sniper fire Wednesday, and one person was killed, police said.
   That raised the toll in east Beirut since Jan. 30 to 758 killed
and 2,107 wounded. The casualties have resulted from clashes
between renegade Gen. Michel Aoun's troops and Samir Geagea's
Lebanese Forces militiamen.
   The factions are fighting each other for control of the
310-square-mile Christian enclave.

   The U.S. economy continues to grow slowly,
although there is widespread weakness in the automobile industry,
the Federal Reserve said Wednesday in its latest survey of economic
activity across the country.
   ``Most Federal Reserve districts describe economic activity as
expanding slowly,'' the central bank survey found. ``Consumer
spending varies from moderate to strong, except for auto sales,
which have slowed after a January rebound.
   ``The manufacturing sector is soft, but is improving in some
districts,'' the report said, noting that the Boston, Philadelphia
and St. Louis district banks reported declines.
   ``The weakness in autos and auto-related industries, however, is
widespread,'' according to a summary of the study. However, it
found auto dealer inventories improved after sales incentives were
restored in January.
   The survey was prepared by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago
based on information gathered before March 6.
   The survey found sluggish construction activity in most
districts except Chicago and San Francisco, which reported
relatively strong activity.
   It said agricultural conditions were generally good, although
concern over lack of soil moisture was expressed in the Midwest and
West. Actual drought damage was reported in the Dallas district.
   ``Freeze damage to fruits and vegetables caused some problems in
the Atlanta and Dallas districts,'' it said, with Atlanta reporting
that citrus prices are likely to remain high throughout 1990.
   The Dallas district also reported that ``it may be two years
before marketable citrus can again be produced in the Rio Grande
Valley of Texas.''
   Other natural resource-related industries, such as forestry
products, mining and oil and gas drilling, were reported to be
``generally very strong.''
   ``Banks have become less aggressive in making new loans, and
demand for most types of loans has softened,'' the summary said.
``Most districts report that financial institutions are either less
willing to extend credit or actually tightening credit terms.''
   But the report did not mention any inflationary problems that
prompted the Federal Open Market Committee to tighten credit a year
ago. The move drove up interest rates and slowed the economy.
Interest rates have edged down gradually since last summer.
   The Fed survey is conducted eight times a year in preparation
for meetings of the FOMC, the Fed's monetary policy-setting arm.
The next meeting is March 27.

<HEAD>Reformer Chosen New Party Leader of Mongolia</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mongolia's ruling Communist party
agreed Thursday to give up its monopoly on power and selected its
youngest leadership in years, including a reformer to head the
party.
   The party _ which has ruled Mongolia for 66 years _ met
virtually all the demands made by newly formed opposition parties
in recent weeks. The opposition groups' protests since January led
to the special Central Committee meeting, which opened Monday and
ended early Thursday.
   The Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary
Party named 61-year-old Gombojavyn Ochirbat its new general
secretary and chose an entirely new five-man Politburo.
   ``This is the beginning of real change,'' said Foreign Minstry
spokesman Tepbishiin Chimeddorj.
   Former party leader Jambyn Batmonh remains Mongolian president
even though he lost his party job.
   In another dramatic repudiation of its past, the policy-making
Central Committee voted to expel former party leader Yumjaagiyn
Tsedenbal from the party. Tsedenbal, 73, presided over purges of
the party during his 31 years in power that ended in 1984. He now
lives in Moscow.
   Ochirbat spent the last two years as party representative to the
World Marxist Review based in Prague, Czechoslovakia.
   He had been a member of the Central Committee but had not played
an active role in Mongolian politics for the past two years. He
returned to Mongolia in the past few days when he was invited to
attend the committee meeting.
   Ochirbat had been head of the Mongolian trade unions in the
early 1980s, but was ousted in 1982 and indirectly criticized by
the Central Committee under Tsedenbal. It offered no specific
public criticism.
   A government official speaking on condition of anonymity
characterized Ochirbat as a reformer and indicated he was not
closely linked to Batmonh.
   The Central Committee proposed an extraordinary party conference
on April 10 that will select a new Central Committee.
   Most elderly members of the current Central Committee offered
their resignations. More than half of the committee's 174 full and
non-voting members are 60 years old or more.
   Besides Ochirbat, the other four members of the new Politburo
all are reform-minded and less than 50 years old, giving the party
its youngest leadership in years.
   The new leaders include L. Tudev, director of the party
newspaper Unen and chairman of the Mongolian Union of Journalists;
Foreign Minister Ts. Gombosuren; M. Michigdorg; and Ts. Oold,
chairman of the party's Control Commission.
   It was not immediately clear whether the new Politburo would
serve after the party congress. The new Central Committee elected
by the Congress has the right to choose a new Politburo.
   Party leaders also have agreed to hold early elections this year
for a new legislature. Oppostion groups want elections this summer,
but no date has been set. Elections originally were scheduled for
1991.
   Chimeddorj said many Central Committee members criticized
themselves during the meeting for having failed earlier to reform
the country's centralized economic and Stalinist system of
government.
   The policy-making body voted to rehabilitate all party leaders
purged from 1962 to 1964 on charges of being against the party. The
number of people affected was not immediately known. The party
already has begun the work of rehabilitating those purged from the
1930s to 1950s under Tsedenbal and his predecessor, Marshal
Horloogiyn Choybalsan.
   Meanwhile, government leaders held a third meeting with
representatives of opposition groups.
   Opposition participants said later they agreed to set up a new
commission to rewrite the constitution, with one representative
each from the ruling party and four major opposition groups.

   A platoon of border guards was attacked
Wednesday from across the frontier with India, and at least three
soldiers were killed, officials said.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a group
of border guards on routine patrol in the southeastern Rangmati
district were fired at by ``uniformed personnel'' from Indian
territory.
   The officials said at least three soldiers were killed and
``several others'' wounded. They spoke on telephone from the town

   Government officials in New Delhi, the Indian capital, said they
had not received information about the incident.

   Martin Marietta Corp. today launched
a powerful commercial rocket to boost a $140 million communications
satellite into orbit, but the uninsured satellite did not
immediately signal that it was working.
   The big Titan 3 blasted off at 6:52 a.m. EST into a cloudy sky
from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.
   Intelsat, the international communications company, hoped for
confirmation the satellite was working on its third expected pass
over a tracking station on Hawaii, at about 11 a.m., but no signal
was confirmed, said Don O'Neal, a spokesman for Hughes Aircraft
Co., which built the satellite.
   At midday, the Washington, D.C.-based Intelsat issued a brief
statement saying that the satellite ``is encountering
difficulties,'' adding that company officials hoped to have more
information later.
   The North American Aerospace Command in Colorado, which tracks
objects in space, said it was asked by Martin Marietta to locate
the satellite.
   The satellite separated from the rocket 25 minutes after launch,
said Judy Stowell, a Martin Marietta spokeswoman. But satellite
industry sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
separation had not occurred.
   ``We think we did a very good and a very accurate job,'' said
Edward M. Browne, president of Martin Marietta Commercial Titan Inc.
   But no data was received from the satellite when it passed over
Hawaii. At midmorning, Hughes said it also was not clear if an
on-board rocket motor fired to send the satellite into a higher
orbit. That should have occurred before the satellite sent its
first signals back to Earth.
   ``I don't know where the problem is at this point, but I can say
we've not gotten a firm signal yet,'' said O'Neal. ``It has
happened in the past, but it is unusual.''
   He was not certain whether the problem was on the ground or on
the satellite.
   The commercial launch of the Intelsat VI satellite, owned by a
not-for-profit, international consortium, is the fourth by an
American company.
   The 5-ton satellite, nearly four stories tall with its antennas
and solar panels deployed, was intended to transmit up to 120,000
telephone calls and three television channels for more than 13
years.
   The satellite was to replace two older satellites over the
Atlantic Ocean.
   It was scheduled to reach final orbit 22,300 miles above Earth
on Sunday, and then was to undergo tests before being placed in
service in late May.
   The first Intelsat VI, launched in October by the European Space
Agency's Ariane rocket, is being tested in orbit and will be placed
in service April 7.
   Frederick Ormsby, spacecraft mission director for the
International Telecommunications Satellite Organization, or
Intelsat, said last month's explosion of an Ariane rocket should
not affect plans to launch two more Intelsat VI satellites on
Ariane boosters next year.
   The unmanned Ariane rocket carrying two Japanese communications
satellites blew apart over the Atlantic shortly after taking off
from Kourou, French Guiana. The accident prompted Arianespace,
which runs the program, to suspend all Ariane launches pending an
investigation.
   Intelsat did not insure the satellite launched today, Ormsby
said, because the Ariane explosion put already high insurance
prices out of range.
   The launch and satellite together cost an estimated $270 million.
   Intelsat, a Washington, D.C.-based commercial cooperative of 118
member nations, owns and operates a global communications satellite
system used by more than 170 countries. Today's launch is its 44th.
The first Intelsat communications satellite was launched 25 years
ago next month.
   The Titan 3, built at Martin Marietta's Denver plant, is the
most powerful U.S. commercial rocket. Martin Marietta's first
commercial launch of the Titan 3 on Dec. 31 propelled British and
Japanese communications satellites into orbit.
   McDonnell Douglas launched the first U.S. commercial rocket, the
Delta, which took a British Satellite Broadcasting satellite into
orbit last August. General Dynamics plans to enter the competition
in June with its Atlas rocket.

   President Bush will meet separately next month
with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and French President
Francois Mitterrand to discuss issues facing NATO, the White House
announced today.
   Bush will meet with Mrs. Thatacher in Bermuda on April 13 and
with Mitterrand in Florida on April 19.
   ``As the year unfolds, the president will continue to consult
closely with his counterparts in the Atlantic community on the
historic changes in Europe,'' presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said in a statement.
   After Bush and Mrs. Thatcher hold their informal meeting in the
British colony, the president will spend the night on the island,
returning to Washington on April 14.
   Bush met with Mrs. Thatcher in London last year and again in
1989 when she visited him at Camp David, the presidential retreat
in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains.
   ``The president and the prime minister will discuss a wide range
of issues related to events in Eastern Europe, NATO and bilateral
relations,'' a White House statement said.
   In London, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Thatcher said she was due to
meet Bush in July but the April meeting was set up ``by mutual
agreement because of the pace of world events.''
   Mrs. Thatcher will spend two nights on the island, a
self-governing British colony, the spokeswoman added, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Mitterrand and Bush met last December on the French Carribbean
island of St. Martin. The president also invited Mitterrand to his
oceanside home in Kennebunkport, Maine, last May and the two met
during last July's seven-nation economic summit in Paris.
   White House aides said the session with Mitterrand would take
place in South Florida, but an exact location has not yet been
detrmined. Bush had been scheduled to be in Islamorada, in the
Florida Keys, on April 20.

<TEXT>
   A police officer was convicted and
sentenced to 4{ years in prison Wednesday for his part in the
bloody crackdown on dissent that began the uprising against
Communist rule, news reports said.
   First Lt. Jaroslav Oudran was the first of 25 police officers to
be tried for assaulting demonstrators in Prague.
   On Nov. 17, 1989, riot police in the city brutally dispersed
tens of thousands of people marking the 50th anniversary of the
death of Jan Opletal, a student who died while protesting the Nazi
occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1939.
   The crackdown triggered protests that eventually swept the
hard-line leadership of Milos Jakes from power and ended four
decades of Communist rule. Playwright and one-time dissident Vaclav
Havel was later elected president.
   Oudran was accused of beating an onlooker, Katerina Vavrova, 29,
causing brain a contusion and neck injury and making her unfit to
work for three months.
   Oudran pleaded guilty of ``abuse of power of an official,'' CTK
said. The crime is punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Oudran
was convicted and sentenced by the court in Terezin, 40 miles north
of Prague, the news agency said.
   Both the prosecution and defense said they had not decided
whether to appeal the verdict.
   ``I have pronounced a sentence approximately identical to the
one demanded by the prosecution, and I am of the opinion it is a
just verdict,'' Judge Miroslav Janzura told CTK.
   During the trial, Oudran repeatedly expressed regret over his
actions, claiming he was in severe emotional distress.
   According to the prosecution, Oudran took Ms. Vavrova by the
hair and beat her head against a pillar four times before she fell
to the ground. Then he allegedly kicked her in the hip.
   ``Mr. Oudran apologized to me and expressed sincere regret. I
have accepted his apology, because I no longer feel anger or need
for revenge ... I consider the sentence appropriate,'' Ms. Vavrova
told CTK after the sentencing.
   According to the government, 590 people were injured during the
crackdown, including dozens of foreign journalists.
   Miroslav Stepan, Prague Communist Party boss at the time of the
demostration, was arrested Dec. 23 in connection with the police
actions and is being held pending trial.
   Stepan is the only civilian in custody in connection with the
Nov. 17 events.
   It was not immediately clear when the 24 other police officers
charged would be tried.

<TEXT>
   A proposal to streamline death penalty appeals
should be changed to provide greater legal protection for people
accused or convicted of murder, the federal judiciary's
policy-making arm recommended Wednesday.
   The 27-member Judicial Conference of the United States proposed
modifying a plan by a committee appointed by Chief Justice William
H. Rehnquist and headed by retired Supreme Court Justice Lewis F.
Powell.
   The conference proposals, which will be submitted to Congress,
are aimed at assuring competent legal help for all defendants who
face the death penalty _ from the initial trial through successive
rounds of appeals.
   The conference adopted the report at a private meeting Tuesday;
the results were announced Wednesday.
   David Sellers, a spokesman for the conference, said the judges
were divided over the issue. He declined to reveal the vote.
   The announcement was hailed by civil libertarians who have
attacked the the Rehnquist committee's plan.
   Leslie Harris of the American Civil Liberties Union said the
proposed changes were ``a stunning departure'' that could go a long
way toward protecting the rights of defendants in capital
punishment cases.
   The judicial conference urged that any state choosing to adopt
the streamlined procedures must adhere to a proposed national
standard for determining which lawyers are qualified to represent
defendants in capital cases.
   The judges endorsed a proposal by the American Bar Association,
which recommended softening the impact of the Rehnquist committee's
plan.
   The judges, whose views are expected to carry considerable
weight in Congress, also proposed changing the plan to make it
easier for death row inmates to file repeated appeals challenging
their death sentences.
   The Rehnquist committee proposed that states limit death row
inmates to two rounds of appeals in state and federal courts. One
round would challenge a verdict directly; a second would be based
on alleged violations of the condemned individual's rights.
   If the plan is approved by Congress, states that decide to go
along would be required to assure legal help to death row inmates
at taxpayer expense throughout the appeals process. That is not the
case now.
   The ACLU and other groups that attacked the original plan said
its promise of more legal help for death row inmates is an empty
one because it offers no assurance that state-appointed lawyers
will be competent.
   There are more than 2,200 convicted murderers on death rows
nationwide. Only 121 executions have occurred since the Supreme
Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976.
   The average delay between conviction and execution is more than
eight years.
   The judicial conference also announced it is giving news
organizations more time to present their views on letting
television cameras into federal courtrooms. The conference will
postpone until September its report on televising federal court
proceedings.
   ``Basically, the door is still open on this issue,'' Sellers
said.
   The conference has opposed such televised coverage.

<TEXT>
   President Bush is targeting planned
construction at several military bases slated for closing or
realignment to help finance a $300 million aid package for
Nicaragua.
   The letter detailing the proposed sources for the assistance
caused consternation Wednesday among lawmakers who complained in
January when Defense Secretary Dick Cheney announced his candidates
for closure that the list was partisan.
   Cheney recommended closing or scaling back more than 72 domestic
facilities and 14 overseas installations, but faces an uphill fight
trying to persuade Congress to accept that list.
   Complicating the situation is the administration's decision to
include several of those facilities on its list of possible sources
for Nicaraguan aid.
   The list was sent to members of Congress this week; The
Associated Press obtained a copy Wednesday.
   A total of $31 million would come from canceling or delaying
work on an automated record fire range at Fort Ord, Calif.; the
Porter River road bridge and physical fitness training center at
Fort Knox, Ky.; and barracks modernization, battalion headquarters
and a vehicle wash facility at Fort Hood, Texas.
   Savings from canceling plans to build a hazardous and flammable
storehouse at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard would total $10
million.
   Rep. Thomas Foglietta, D-Pa., complained to Pentagon officials
that the Congress included money for the warehouse in last year's
budget, and questioned whether officials ``cared about safety.''
   David Berteau, a deputy assistant secretary of defense for
production and logistics, told the House Armed Services
subcommittee on military installations and facilities that the
shipyard is part of the proposed list for closure.
   ``This is based in part on a force structure reduction,''
Berteau said. Pentagon officials believe studying ``candidates is
the right way to go.''
   The president's list to help finance aid to the Central American
nation also includes $11 million that had been slated for repair of
the No. 2 gun turret aboard the USS Iowa.
   The turret was destroyed in the April 19 explosion that killed
47 sailors.

<HEAD>More Taxpayers Designating $1 for Campaign Fund</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nearly 25 percent of taxpayers are designating
$1 of their federal taxes this year for the presidential campaign
fund, the Internal Revenue Service said Wednesday.
   That's up from last year, when about 20 percent used a checkoff
box on their returns to earmark $1 _ or $2 in the case of a couple
_ for the fund. The $32 million designated in 1989 raised the total
collected since the fund was created in 1972 to $567 million.
   Earmarking the $1 does not reduce a refund or increase a
taxpayer's liability.
   The IRS said that through Friday, it had received 44.8 million
returns and processed 33 million. Filings are up 3.5 percent from a
year ago and processing is 12.5 percent ahead of last year's pace.
   Nearly 3.3 million couples and individuals have filed their
returns electronically this year, compared with 861,916 during the
same period a year ago. This is the first year that electronic

   Tom Cruise, who got stopped for speeding
while in town to film a movie on car racing, was allowed to plead
guilty to a lesser charge and pay a decreased fine.
   City officials even discussed dropping the charge against the
27-year-old actor, but decided not to in fear of adverse publicity,
Mayor Ronnie Ward said.
   Cruise was charged with driving 66 mph in a 35 mph zone on March
2. He could have paid as much as $237 in fines and fees and had six
points lodged against his South Carolina driving record.
   Instead, he paid a $125 fine Monday after City Judge Dan Causey
reduced the charge to careless operation of a vehicle, which
carries no point penalty.
   Cruise was able to pay the fine before his case came up in
court, and not miss any time filming ``Days of Thunder'' at
Darlington International Raceway.
   Ward called the plea bargain ``sort of a happy medium.'' He said
Cruise was not driving drunk or recklessly, but ``you don't want
him to get off scot-free.''

   Jay Leno was too busy to write back to
an elementary school pupil doing a report on comedy _ so the
comedian called.
   Zachary Hoover, 10, a fifth-grader at Brentwood Elementary,
wrote to Leno, well known as a substitute host on ``The Tonight
Show,'' with some questions.
   A teacher discouraged Zachary from writing, saying Leno would be
too busy to respond. He called March 1.
   ``It was pretty amazing,'' said Zachary's mother, Janet Hoover.
``When you think that a kid admires someone famous and that person
takes a personal interest in the kid ... Zach's bouncing off the
walls, he's so excited.''
   The family met Leno at Indianapolis International Airport March
2 as the comedian passed through the city on the way to a show in
Fort Wayne. Zachary got the comedian's autograph and the family
took pictures.
   A spokesman for Leno in Los Angeles says the comedian ``does
this sort of thing all the time. He and his special assistant go
through his fan mail and if there's a request that touches him in
some way he will call. That's Jay's style.''
   Zachary had not gotten his grade yet Wednesday on the comedy
report.

   Former ``Partridge Family'' star Danny
Bonaduce said he felt suicidal when his drug arrest in Florida made
national news.
   Bonaduce, 31, was arrested last weekend for allegedly buying
crack in Daytona Beach, Fla.
   The actor who played Danny Partridge on ``The Partridge Family''
sit-com from 1970-74 feared losing his job as a disc jockey for
WEGX-FM, known as Eagle 106.
   ``I was totally suicidal. I was having heart attacks about being
fired. I couldn't believe I hurt the Eagle,'' Bonaduce said.
   He managed to keep his sense of humor, though. Bonaduce told The
Philadelphia Inquirer he called his girlfriend and told her, ``I'm
going to blow my brains out, but this is my favorite shirt.''
   Station manager Dave Noll suspended Bonaduce from his
$75,000-a-year job, but agreed to company-paid drug treatment and
weekly drug testing that could lead to his return.
   ``I feel like a monumental fool,'' Bonaduce said. ``Even Carl
Sagan couldn't figure out how stupid I am. I screwed up completely.
I can barely look at myself. It's all my fault. I don't even know
why. To anyone who believed the Danny Partridge myth, I'm sorry.''

   Expenses such as theater and equipment rental ate
up more than three-fourths of the $141,000 proceeds of a Dionne
Warwick AIDS benefit last November, disappointed beneficiaries said.
   ``I think its unfair to people to say you're doing a fund-raiser
for children and trying to appeal to their emotions, and then spend
that much money on expenses,'' Judy Lipshutz, who heads United
Community Services' AIDS Care Connection in southeast Michigan,
said Tuesday.
   The benefit provided the Dionne Warwick Foundation in
Washington, D.C., 45 percent of the proceeds after expenses and
Detroit area AIDS groups 55 percent.
   About $12,000 will go to Warwick foundation, $15,000 to area
groups, and the remaining $114,000 to expenses, said Georgella
Bascom Muirhead, the city's director of public information.

   Olympic silver medalist Linford Christie has been
awarded damages from London police for unlawful arrest and libel.
   ``He's pleased the suit is behind him and he can get on with his
life,'' Christie's coach, Ron Roddan, said Wednesday.
   The award's amount was not disclosed in court documents, but
British news reports put it at more than $48,000.
   Christie was arrested in July 1988 and accused of stealing a
rental car that had wrongly been reported missing. Budget
Rent-A-Car International had loaned cars to all members of the
British team for the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, South Korea.
   Christie's lawyer, Geoffrey Bindman, told the High Court a
police press officer informed a reporter of the arrest three days
after the 29-year-old sprinter was sent a letter telling him he was
cleared.
   The athlete, who is black, was quoted as telling The Independent
newspaper after Tuesday's court decision that the police action
``was a thing of blatant racism.''
   Christie placed second in the 100-meter event in Seoul two
months after his arrest and won the gold medal at the Commonwealth
Games in Auckland, New Zealand, last month.

   A tornado showed one off-duty policewoman a
real walk on the wild side.
   ``All I could think of was this is like the Wizard of Oz,'' Sgt.
Paula Shaw said Tuesday after a tornado picked her up and threw her
10 feet as she clung to her pet dog.
   ``Like Superman,'' Ms. Shaw said. ``It sucked us up, literally
sucked us in there, along with tree branches, and mud and leaves.
It was incredible.''
   Ms. Shaw reported only a few aches and pains Wednesday. The dog
also wasn't hurt.
   Ms. Shaw and her dog had walked outside their home in
southeastern Oklahoma City about 6 p.m. Tuesday, at the height of a
tornado-riddled thunderstorm, police said.
   Ms. Shaw never saw what hit her, police said.
   ``She'd gone out in the back yard to view the storm, to see what
was going on,'' said Sgt. Janet Hogue. ``It picked her up and kind
of tossed her around with the lawn furniture and stuff.''
   ``She just said it felt real weird,'' police spokesman Maj. Bob
Taylor said.
   Ms. Hogue said the rough ride was ``probably the worst thing
that ever happened'' to Ms. Shaw, a more than five-year veteran of
the police force. ``We all get in minor scuffles, but nothing
serious.''
   Ms. Shaw picked herself up after her flight, went around to
check on neighbors and then radioed for help, Ms. Hogue said.
   ``She said she wasn't really scared at the time, she was
shocked,'' Ms. Hogue said. ``It shook her up a little bit, but she
wanted to get to her neighbors. She was concerned about their
welfare.''

   Two-thirds of the members of the Senate have
sent a letter to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, criticizing his
government for continuing to deny exit visas to some longtime
refuseniks, sponsors said Wednesday.
   ``In the spirit of the continuing renewal of cooperation between
our two countries, we are writing to express our concern about the
problem of Soviet citizens who have been refused permission to
emigrate,'' the letter said.
   The letter, dated March 2 and circulated by Sens. Bob Graham,
D-Fla., and Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., was signed by 67 senators.
   The senators said in the letter that they found it ``extremely
disturbing'' that many families remain trapped in the Soviet Union.
   They praised Gorbachev for moving quickly to grant visas to some
refuseniks, generally Soviet Jews who were barred from practicing
their faith in the Soviet Union. Other, they said, have seen their
cases languish.
   More than 20 people on a list submitted to Gorbachev first
applied to leave the Soviet Union more than a decade ago.
   ``For these people, and for all those arbitrarily denied the
right to leave their country, we request your careful attention,''
the letter said.
   Those who are kept in Soviet Union are often denied visas on the
grounds they had access to state secrets at some time. The state
secrets law is simply an excuse, the letter said.
   The senators cited the case of Vladimir Raiz, who first applied
to emigrate 25 years ago.
   Stacy Burdette, a spokeswoman for the Union of Councils for
Soviet Jews, a group that presses for looser Soviet emigration
policies, said Raiz and his wife, Carmen, were granted exit visas
within the last few days.
   While thousands of Jews have moved to Israel and the United
States in recent years, Burdette said there are an estimated
850,000 still trying to leave the country where anti-semitism has
flared.
   About 71,000 people emigrated last year.
   Moreover, she said President Bush gave Gorbachev a list of 20
people the United States would like to see given permission to
leave when the two met at the Malta summit in November. Of those,
17 cases have not been addressed.
   Burdette said there is legislation pending in the Supreme Soviet
that would reform the emigration process and limit to five years
the time a person could be blocked by the state secrets act.

   Seventy members of a bikers group are seeking
$3 million in damages from a police force they claim violated their
rights during a 14-city hunt in 1983 for a biker suspected of
stabbing three bar patrons.
   The Vagos, which was formed in the 1960s to rival the Hells
Angels, alleges Hawthorne Police Department used unnecessary force,
brandished guns in children's faces and confiscated personal
property during raids on 43 homes on Aug. 9 and Sept. 7, 1983.
   The lawsuit, filed jointly by the American Civil Liberties
Union, alleges emotional distress and civil rights violations. The
jury trial before Superior Court Judge Maurice Hogan Jr. opened
last month, and will hear from nearly 200 witnesses during the next
two months, court officials said.
   Ed ``Fat Eddie'' Serna, who has since retired from the Vagos,
testified that his restored 1948 Harley Davidson was confiscated
and returned months later with a rusted motor and broken shift rod,
the chrome pitted and the paint scratched.
   ``It was in real bad shape,'' he testified. ``I felt very angry.
I worked four years on it and was that close to driving it and it
was taken away.''
   About 50 police officers from various departments across
southern California took part in the hunt for Vagos member Raymond
``South Bay Ray'' Malloy. Some of the homes were occupied by former
and current Vagos members, and others by people who said they had
never heard of the group.
   Molloy was not found, and later surrendered. He pleaded guilty
to a reduced assault and battery charge and was sentenced to 142
days in jail. Molloy stabbed three men in a bar brawl, but none was
seriously injured.
   The defendants were named as former Hawthorne Police Chief
Kenneth R. Stonebraker, three lieutenants, a sergeant and numerous
unidentified officers. The ACLU alleges Hawthorne police lied in
affidavits to obtain search warrants and harassed the families to
make Malloy surrender.
   Hawthorne police denied the allegations and say they believed
the Vagos group was hiding Malloy.
   ``Vagos were known violent people, and the police were knocking
on doors with the expectation of finding Malloy, who had been
accused of three vicious stabbings,'' said John Daly, an attorney
for the city.

<HEAD>Iraq Says No to Request For Foreign Secretary's Visit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd's request to visit
Iraq to ask for mercy on behalf of a journalist condemned to death
has been rejected, the government said Wednesday.
   A Foreign Office spokesman said Hurd asked Britain's ambassador
to Iraq to arrange a meeting for him with President Saddam Hussein
of Iraq.
   The Foreign Office announced that the Iraqi government responded
``this would not be the right time for a visit.''
   ``It was made clear that the Iraqi government did not feel able
to discuss these cases in the present atmosphere,'' said the
spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Iraqi Embassy spokesman Wajdi Mardan said Wednesday that Iraq
considered a visit by Hurd ``rather inconvenient in view of the
probability that this visit could be seen as part of the current
media campaign, which is presumably intended to bring pressure on
the Iraqi government.''
   Britain has been waging a diplomatic and media campaign seeking
clemency for the London-based journalist Farzad Bazoft, who was
convicted of espionage by an Iraqi court last week and sentenced to
death.
   Britain is also trying to win clemency for a British nurse
sentenced to 15 years in prison for allegedly helping Bazoft.
   The nurse, Daphne Parish, 52, was charged with driving Bazoft to
Iraq's Al-Iskandaria military complex in September where he was
investigating reports of an explosion at the complex.
   Iraq has not set a date for the execution.
   The Iraqi News Agency reported Tuesday that Hussein said he will
not decide whether to commute the death sentence ``while under
political and media pressure.''
   British officials said the government will continue to campaign
for clemency. But they acknowledged privately they faced a problem
in striking a balance between keeping up the pressure and creating
what one called a ``counterproductive'' reaction in Iraq.
   A delegation of human rights groups and media unions met with
the Iraqi ambassador in London on Wednesday to express their
concern over Bazoft's death sentence.
   Requests for a reduction of the sentences have already been sent
by U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, Amnesty
International, the European Community and international press
groups.
   Bazoft, a stateless Iranian, has lived in Britain since 1975 and
travels on British documents. He is a reporter for The Observer, a
British weekly. Mrs. Parish is a senior nursing administrator for
an Irish-run hospital in Baghdad.

<HEAD>Congress Wants Role in Study of Veterans Hospitals</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers who last year refused to touch
legislation that would have led to an outside study of the
veterans' health care system were ready Wednesday to tell the
Department of Veterans Affairs how to run a similar internal study.
   ``Congress must also play a role in the future of the VA health
care system,'' Rep. G.V. Montgomery, D-Miss., said at a hearing of
the Veterans Affairs subcommittee on hospitals and health care.
   ``After all, the legislative branch is the policy making body,''
said Montgomery, chairman of the full committee and the
subcommittee.
   Montgomery last summer rejected a proposal by Veterans Secretary
Edward J. Derwinski for legislation that would have created an
outside review commission to study the department's health care
network.
   Montgomery said at the time that Congress was ``not in the
mood'' for such a commission, which was proposed as lawmakers were
considering recommendations from a commission to close military
bases.
   Derwinski, acknowledging the poor political timing of the
legislative proposal, last January said he would appoint his own
commission. Derwinski pledged Wednesday that the commission he was
proposcing would be independent and he had no intention of
recommending that facilities be closed.
   Still, VA facilities could undergo important changes in a
status-conscious health care industry. For example, only one
facility in a group could offer open-heart surgery, or some
hospitals could be converted to clinics or long-term care
facilities.
   The department operates 172 medical centers as well as 233
outpatient clinics. Derwinski said the system has not been examined
in 25 years. Six medical centers were closed as a result of the
last study.
   Veterans groups expressed concern at Wednesday's hearing that
the proposed study would be used to cut back on health care.
   ``All too often in the past, when there was talk of re-examining
the VA's mission, reducing services was the hidden agenda,'' said
Dennis M. Cullinan of the Veterans of Foreign Wars.
   He noted a General Accounting Offce study that recommended
shrinking the VA medical care system.
   Both Cullinan and Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II, D-Mass., also
cautioned the department not to confuse monetary problems with
system problems.
   ``We shouldn't blame the victim here,'' Kennedy said, explaining
that some hospitals may have unused beds because they can't afford
to care for more patients.
   Montgomery said he would like to recommend someone to be
appointed to the commission, which would report its findings no
later than October 1991.

   Gov. Gaston Caperton all but ruled out
an across-the-board raise in an offer to West Virginia's striking
teachers that was quickly rejected by the state's largest education
union.
   Caperton made the proposal, described by the governor's
education secretary as his ``last, best and final'' offer, late
Tuesday after a second day of talks aimed at ending the state's
first teacher strike, now in its sixth school day.
   Among other things, the governor proposed an ``education
summit'' in May, adjustments in pay aimed at equalizing teacher
salaries statewide, and full funding of health insurance and
pensions.
   But in a reversal from last week, he said he would call a
special legislative session to consider a raise only if the state
develops a big enough surplus. This year's budget is running $29.5
million behind estimates.
   The West Virginia Education Association said today that
Caperton's proposal to call a special legislative session only if
the surplus is high enough was ``too vague.''
   As for the proposed May summit meeting on education, WVEA
President Kayetta Meadows said in a statement that it was
``positive but lacking in substance.''
   ``Teachers have been on the picket lines for concrete
improvements. For years they've heard promises, and those promises
have been consistently broken,'' she said. ``The education summit
will simply be another study if it is not backed by a special
legislative session.''
   Gubernatorial spokesman G.C. Morse called the union's decision
``sad.''
   ``The governor is very disappointed,'' Morse said. ``He feels
like a tragedy is being worked out here by some folks that really
don't understand West Virginia's fiscal situation and the strains
we're operating under.''
   In announcing his propossal, Caperton said the state ``simply
cannot afford to do more. No matter how justified their position
may be on the matter of teacher compensation, I bear a
responsibility to the taxpayers of West Virginia.''
   Meadows' group, the 16,000-member WVEA, is the larger of the two
groups that went on strike last week. The smaller union group, the
3,000-member West Virginia Federation of Teachers, promised a
response to Caperton's proposal later this afternoon.
   More than 85 percent of West Virginia's 22,000 teachers walked
out March 7 for higher pay and benefits. By Tuesday, the strike had
spread to 46 of the state's 55 counties.
   Steve Haid, secretary of education, called the governor's
proposal ``his last, best and final effort which he could
legitimately undertake.''
   If the teachers do not accept the proposal, decisions on whether
striking teachers lose pay for days they were off work, are
suspended or dismissed rest with the county school boards and
school superintendents, Haid said at a briefing this morning.
   ``The legislature will likely adjourn tonight or Thursday.
They're going home,'' Haid said. ``The governor's authority in the
matter is very, very narrow.''
   The number of teachers and students affected was not immediately
available, but on Monday the strike idled nearly 150,000 of the
state's 328,000 school students. About 3,000 of the state's
teachers are not unionized.
   In Wood County, where teachers have voted to remain on the job,
about half of the 800 students at Parkersburg South High School
left class today when roving pickets set up a strike line in front
of the school, Principal Tim Swarr said.
   On March 5, the governor and legislative leaders offered the
teachers a 5 percent raise financed by a tax increase for coal
producers, but that deal collapsed the next day.
   On Tuesday he said he wouldn't offer an across-the-board raise
because it would require a tax increase.
   The state's average teacher salary is $21,904, less than every
state except Arkansas and South Dakota, according to the National
Education Association. That figure does not include a 5 percent
raise teachers received in February.
   Caperton called the meetings with the teacher representatives
``cordial and fruitful.''
   ``And, although we have not yet reached a final agreement on
returning teachers to the classrooms, we have closed the distance
between ourselves and that goal,'' he said.

   Three weeks ago, a Mongolian opposition leader
predicted that the pace of political change in Ulan Bator would be
faster than in Moscow.
   The events of the past week have proved Sanjaasuren Zorig right.
The leadership has bowed to opposition demands for sweeping
political changes, and those who just a few weeks ago talked about
the ideal government and economy for Mongolia must now find ways to
realize those dreams.
   On Monday, the Communist Party Politburo decided to abolish its
constitutional guarantee on power, replace the Politburo and party
general secretary Jambyn Batmonh, hold early legislative elections
and write a new constitution.
   The Central Committee on Thursday approved ending the
66-year-old guarantee on power, chose a reformer to lead the party,
and installed its youngest Politburo in years.
   These changes come less than three months after Mongolia's first
opposition group _ the Mongolian Democratic Union headed by Zorig _
came on the scene, staging peaceful rallies urging political reform.
   Since then, a half-dozen other political groups have emerged,
and three political parties have formed _ the latest Tuesday.
   The groups have joined together to urge faster, sweeping
political reform even though they disagree on what type of
government and economy would be best for Mongolia, a nation of 1.9
million.
   In late February, Zorig sat beneath a portrait of Karl Marx in a
classroom at the Mongolian State University in the capital, Ulan
Bator. He told a small group of reporters what he envisions for
Mongolia's future.
   ``The most important thing to be carried out is political
changes. The main methods to carry out this political construction
(is) first to create a multiparty system, introduce a parliamentary
system and have presidential rule,'' he said.
   ``Also to give political freedom to the people.''
   Zorig, a 27-year-old post-graduate student of scientific
communism and a former university lecturer, envisaged a collective,
not state-owned, economy.
   Zorig said he wanted ``to turn this `credit-fed' economy into an
independent economy.'' Mongolia has been economically dependent on
the Soviet Union for decades, and Western economists put the debt
at close to $6 billion.
   Land would be leased for cultivation, and there would be no
limits on the number of privately owned cattle in this nomadic
society where 70 percent of the population still are herdsmen.
Enterprises would be decentralized and leased to workers, and those
operating at a loss would be shut down.
   The main goal is that ``those who are working should taste the
real fruits of their work,'' Zorig said.
   If the current leadership steps down, Zorig said a coalition
government probably would be formed.
   ``Surely we will be members of that,'' he said. ``Even in this
year, the Mongolian Democratic Party will be member of parliament.''
   Such hopes for change were not limited to those in the
opposition.
   Even a herdswoman who lives outside Ulan Bator and had only
heard of what was happening in the capital asked: ``Why shouldn't
these parties all co-exist?''
   A ranking government official who has visited Western countries
and observed the workings of those government said he dreams of ``a
new look for Mongolia.''
   After a five-year period of transition and learning, he
predicted, Mongolia would have ``a parliamentary democracy with a
presidential system like the United States _ that is the most
effective and least costly way.''
   The economy would be dynamic, export-oriented and ruled by
market forces, and Mongolians would have ``heightened nationalism
and self-esteem,'' said the official, who spoke on condition he not
be identified.

Mazowiecki next Wednesday at the White House.
   Bush will meet with Mrs. Thatacher in Bermuda on April 13 and
with Mitterrand in Florida on April 19.
   ``As the year unfolds, the president will continue to consult
closely with his counterparts in the Atlantic community on the
historic changes in Europe,'' said presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater.
   ``This is part of the consultations he's doing with Western
allies and as well as Eastern European leaders,'' said Roman
Popadiuk, White House deputy press secretary.
   Major issues are expected to be the rapid move toward
reunification of Germany and the emergence of democractic
governments from former communist states in Eastern Europe.
   Since the beginning of the year, Bush has met with West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Czechozlovakian Prime Minister Vaclav
Havel, Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, Italian Prime
Minister Giulio Andreotti, former Japanese Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita and Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey, who is
president of the European Council.
   In addition, Bush held a December summit with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   After a day of talks with Mrs. Thatcher, Bush will stay
overnight on Bermuda, a self-governing British colony in the
Atlantic Ocean 570 miles off the coast of North Carolina. He will
return to Washington on April 14.
   Fitzwater said the precise location of the talks with Mitterrand
had not been determined, although it probably would be somewhere in
southern Florida.
   On April 20, a day after the meeting with Mitterrand, Bush is
scheduled to make a speech in Orlando and then fly to Islamorada in
the Florida Keys for three days of vacation.
   The meeting with Mrs. Thatcher will be their third one-on-one
meeting following talks last year in London and at Camp David, the
presidential retreat in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains.
   Bush saw Mitterrand during the economic summit in Paris last
summer and again in December on the French Caribbean island of St.
Martin.
   In London, a spokeswoman at Mrs. Thatcher's 10 Downing Street
office said the prime minister had been due to meet Bush in July,
when a seven-nation economic summit is planned in Houston, but the
April meeting was set up ``by mutual agreement because of the pace
of world events.''
   Mrs. Thatcher will spend two nights on the island, the
spokeswoman added, speaking on condition of anonymity.

   In a victory for immigrants who lack permanent
residency visas, the Justice Department on Wednesday announced a
settlement with USAir over a discrimination charge filed by a
would-be flight attendant who didn't have a ``green card.''
   USAir had refused to interview Monique L. Stennett, a Jamaican
citizen, for a flight attendant job because she didn't yet have a
green card, an alien registration card allowing a person to work in
the United States, even though her passport contained a stamp from
the Immigration and Naturalization Service showing she had been
granted permanent residence, the department said.
   The Arlington, Va.-based carrier, which has about 52,000
employees, denied that its practices or involvement with Ms.
Stennett violated the Immigration Reform and Control Act, enacted
in November 1986.
   However, under the agreement reached with the Justice
Department, USAir agreed to compensate Ms. Stennett for the lost
opportunity to interview, to revise its corporate policy manual and
its employment application, which asked whether the applicant is a
U.S. citizen, and to educate employees regarding the requirements
of the act, the department said.
   Ms. Stennett, who now lives in Florida and who has found other
employment, was no longer interested in an interview with USAir.
She did receive a $1,000 payment from the airline, said Andrew M.
Strojny, acting special counsel for immigration-related unfair
employment practices.
   Asked whether the settlement would have a major impact in
reducing discrimination against immigrants, Strojny said:
   ``I would hope so. Since we've now entered into settlements with
five airlines, I would hope we could get it resolved.''
   The other four airlines with which the Justice Department has
reached settlements are Pan Am, America, Northwest and United. The
department won a case against Mesa Airlines.
   Congress created the Office of Special Counsel to enforce the
law's prohibitions against employment discrimination. The office
has received more than 830 charges of discrimination _ 112 are now
under investigation _ reached 95 settlements and filed 23
complaints before an administrative law judge.

<HEAD>Najib: Afghanistan Rejected Soviet military Aid During Coup
Attempt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union offered Afghanistan
emergency military support during last week's coup attempt, but the
Communist government turned down the aid, President Najib said in a
speech obtained Wednesday.
   Najib also disclosed that two days before the failed takeover,
he suspected the defense minister, Shah Nawaz Tanai, was plotting a
coup and offered him the post of presidency. ``It is yours if you
think you can rule,'' Najib said.
   Tanai launched his raid Tuesday. He fled to Pakistan when the
takeover failed but is now believed to be back in Afghanistan,
teamed with a radical guerrilla leader.
   Najib made his remarks in a speech Sunday to tribal elders from
Paktiya province. An Afghan official provided an English
translation Wednesday of the speech, which was given in Pushtu.
   Both Najib and Tanai are from Paktiya. The speech was seen as an
attempt by the president to nullify Tanai's influence among the
tribes of the southeastern province.
   Earlier Wednesday, Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil said Afghanistan
will destroy its huge stockpiles of Soviet-supplied weapons if the
United States and other countries stop supporting Moslem rebels.
   The offer could help pave the way for peace talks on Afghanistan
after 12 years of civil war.
   During the Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan, the
country amassed huge stockpiles of weapons, including thousands of
trucks, tanks, armored personnel carriers, bombs, missiles and guns.
   In negotiations last year, the United States rejected a Soviet
proposal for an end to military aid to the warring sides, because
this would have allowed the Kabul government to keep those
stockpiles.
   Najib did not specify the type of aid offered by the Soviets
during the coup attempt.
   ``I told them, `thank you for your offer but there's no need
now,''' Najib said.
   ``But,'' he said, ``if we face a foreign attack, that will be
different.''
   Soviet troops were withdrawn in 1989 from Afghanistan after
about a decade supporting Najib's troops. Moscow still gives Kabul
about $300 million monthly in military aid, and this has increased
since the bloody coup try.
   In a dispatch Wednesday, the Soviet news agency Tass said 200
civilians died and 500 were injured in the attempt.
   Najib's government has reported only 95 civilian deaths. No
military casualties have been given.
   In his speech, Najib said he feared Tanai, a hard-line
Communist, would unite with guerrilla leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a
radical fundamentalist, to take the strategic city of Khost.
   The Afghan government has reported increased fighting around
Khost in the past two days.
   Throughout the speech, Najib referred to the defense minister
only by his first name, an insult to Afghans.
   The president said two days before the coup attempt he invited
Tanai to his office. ``I had heard rumors that he wanted something,
so I said, `Take the presidency. It is yours if you think you can
rule,''' Najib said.
   Tanai refused the post and pledged loyalty to Najib, the
president said.
   ``Two days later he was bombing me,'' Najib said.
   Meanwhile, in the capital, three rockets fell Wednesday, killing
one civilian and wounding 11, government spokesman Naqib Sameer
said.
   It was the first fatal rocket attack in more than one week.
   Pakistan's Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto called for an end to
U.S. and Soviet arms shipments to Afghanistan.
   ``It is time for all concerned to stop having favorites and
leave it up to the Afghans,'' Mrs. Bhutto said in Islamabad. ``Let
them decide what they want.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush, touring a power plant that
helps keep the lights on at the White House, was told by an
official Wednesday that utilities will have to come up with
``megabucks'' to comply with proposed new pollution rules.
   But Bush pledged that Clean Air Act revisions working their way
through Congress will allow smokestack industries maximum
flexibility on how to meet the stricter new standards.
   ``We can't let this country screech to a halt, but I am
determined to clean up the air,'' declared the president, exhorting
senators to pass a compromise hammered out recently by White House
and Senate leaders.
   The compromise recognizes ``the need to balance environmental
benefits and sustain economic growth for this country,'' said Bush.
   Bush traveled 45 miles by helicopter to visit the Potomac
Electric Power Co.'s Chalk Point Generating Station, which churns
out 2,000 megawatts of electricity for Washington and the Maryland
suburbs.
   The Chalk Point plant, now in compliance with federal and state
standards, is among 107 across the nation that would be forced to
reduce emissions sharply under the new rules.
   Bush said utility president Edward F. Mitchell, his tour guide,
``was telling me there's megabucks involved in all of this.''
   Nancy S. Moses, the utility's manager of media relations, said
its officials estimate a cost of $12 million a year to meet the
first phase of the clean air rules in 1995, primarily by burning
more oil and less coal.
   To meet the second phase standards for the year 2000, the
utility envisions bills of $264 million in capital costs for
scrubbers and other new technology and $36 million in recurrent
operating costs.
   Bush promised that industry would get ``the flexibility to make
emissions reductions in the most cost-effective manner possible.''
   The president donned a white hard hat to inspect two giant
turbine-generators, each capable of turning out 340 megawatts. With
an assist from plant manager Hula Edmonds, Bush turned a dial that
boosted output by 10 megawatts.
   Bush said utility executives assured him they were ``committed
to take these additional steps to meet these even tougher
standards. ... For that we're very grateful.''
   Bush also toured the plant's ``Aquaculture Center'' where the
utility raises striped bass, or rockfish, to replenish the depleted
waters of the nearby Chesapeake Bay. It has already released 1
million fingerlings.
   Bush plucked two adult rockfish out of a net. He also peered
through a microscope at yellow perch eggs, and afterward applauded
the utility's efforts on the environment.
   On Tuesday, in another pitch for the Clean Air Act, Bush made a
shorter hop by car to Dave's Sunoco Station a mile from the U.S.
Capitol to pump methanol fuel into an experimental car.

<HEAD>House Democrats Willing to Wait for Deep Defense Cuts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Most House Democrats want to cut President
Bush's proposed $303 billion defense budget for 1991 but are
willing to wait to make really deep slashes, party leaders said
Wednesday.
   After a closed-door discussion about defense spending attended
by many of the House's 257 majority Democrats, ranking lawmakers
conceded that they had not decided how much military spending the
party should seek.
   However, they said, a consensus was clear.
   ``I think everybody understands this is not the same game on
defense,'' said Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif.
``This is a changed ballgame, because it's a changing world
situation.''
   ``Whatever happens in the Soviet Union, you aren't going to get
that Humpty Dumpty back together again'' to become the military
threat it once was, said Armed Services Committee Chairman Les
Aspin, D-Wis.
   The leaders said, however, that their goal was to reduce defense
spending gradually.
   ``Democrats want a long-term defense policy,'' said Majority
Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.
   Lawmakers who attended the session attributed that tack to two
factors: a desire to arrive at a figure that would attract enough
votes to pass Congress, and the way military spending works.
   ``The leadership is still trying to figure out what number is
going to get to 218 votes,'' the total required for House passage,
said Rep. Jim Slattery, D-Kan., a member of the Budget Committee.
   The mechanics of the budget are also playing a role.
   Because much military spending occurs gradually over several
years _ such as the construction of a submarine _ it can take years
for a cut made in one year to be fully reflected in the budget.
   ``What you have to reverse is what took place over the last
eight or nine years,'' said Panetta, referring to the arms buildup
under the Reagan administration.
   ``That means you're looking at another four- or five-year path''
in the opposite direction, he said.
   Since Bush submitted his fiscal 1991 budget proposal to Congress
in January, most Democrats have argued that the president did not
go far enough in shrinking the Pentagon's budget in response to the
thaw in the Cold War.
   Bush's proposal was $7 billion more than this year's figure, but
$3 billion below what would have been needed to match inflation.
   Conservatives have argued that uncertainty about the future
political situation in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe make it
unwise to cut too deeply into Bush's plan. Liberals have sought
deeper cuts _ to as low as the high $280 billion range _ arguing
that the money would be better spent for deficit-reduction and
social programs.
   Congress' budget committees are nearing the time when they will
have to write a spending blueprint for the next fiscal year, which
begins Oct. 1. Wednesday's Democratic skull-session, which lasted
about two hours, was an effort to begin translating party-members'
criticisms into a solid dollar figure that would win enough votes
for passage.

   Two of Joseph Hazelwood's expert
witnesses took aim at the prosecution's alcohol expert, testifying
that belated blood-alcohol tests cannot prove the Exxon Valdez
skipper was drunk when his ship went aground.
   Alcohol experts Michael Hlstala and Thomas Burr cast doubt
Tuesday on testimony by prosecution expert Richard Prouty that
Hazelwood probably was drunk when his ship rammed a charted reef a
year ago.
   ``It's virtually impossible to go back and get meaningful
information about blood-alcohol levels,'' said Hlstala, a professor
of physiology at Washington State University in Seattle. ``Once you
are beyond a few hours, it's impossible to make any sense of an
extrapolation.''
   In this morning's testimony, an expert said an audio tape the
prosecution wants jurors to hear is actually a poor copy of a Coast
Guard tape.
   Edward Siedlick, a former police detective and now a consultant
in New York, said he analyzed the tape and found that its quality
was so poor that it probably speeded up Hazelwood's voice.
   The expert was called after prosecutors indicated they wanted
jurors to hear Hazelwood's voice on a tape made on the Exxon
Valdez's trip into Valdez, before the tanker went aground March 24
on the outbound trip. They suggested it would show the skipper's
voice was much different from when he reported the grounding to the
Coast Guard, and would help prove he was drunk on the later tape.
   Siedlick said he went to Valdez last month to listen to the
original of the tapes, but when he got there, Coast Guard officers
told him the original had been destroyed. He said he subsequently
learned that the copy in evidence was made by a Coast Guardsman
holding a microcassette recorder up to another recorder.
   ``This tape led me to the conclusion that this microcassette
copy was not an accurate reproduction of the conversation,''
Siedlick said. ``The pitch of the tape seemed to exceed that of the
normal talking voice of Capt. Hazelwood.''
   Also this morning, Hlstala testified that listening to someone's
voice was not a very good way to judge whether the person was drunk.
   In his prosecution testimony, Prouty indicated he calculated
Hazelwood's level of intoxication by calculations in a method
called ``retrograde extrapolation.'' He concluded the skipper
probably had a blood-alcohol reading of .14 at the time of the
shipwreck.
   But he based his opinion on a blood test taken 10{ hours
afterward, which showed Hazelwood had a blood alcohol level of
.061, lower than the Alaska state limit for drunken driving.
   Was the skipper drinking after the wreck? Nobody knows and
Hazelwood isn't expected to testify about it.
   The lack of a timely blood test has been a prosecution problem
from the beginning of the case, providing no direct evidence that
the skipper was tipsy.
   Circumstantial evidence includes testimony from crew members who
saw Hazelwood drinking in Valdez that day. But they said he
negotiated a precarious gangway to the ship without a misstep and
appeared sober as he gave orders.
   Three witnesses, two of them Coast Guard investigators, have
said they smelled alcohol on Hazelwood's breath, but defense
lawyers suggest that was the result of the skipper's having drunk a
low-alcohol brew called Moussy Beer while on the ship.
   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., was the only crew member
from the Exxon Valdez charged criminally in the wreck, which
spilled nearly 11 million gallons of Alaska North Slope crude oil
into the crystal waters of Prince William Sound.
   He is accused of criminal mischief, reckless endangerment,
operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of
oil. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 7\ years in prison
and $61,000 in fines.
   Hlstala testified Tuesday that most experts consider the
technique of ``retrograde extrapolation'' used by Prouty, the
prosecution expert, useful only for calculating back two to three
hours _ not 10{ hours.
   In Hazelwood's case, he said there would be numerous variables
such as the rate at which his body absorbs and eliminates alcohol,
the exact times the captain started and stopped drinking and
whether he ate anything in the 14 hours after boarding the ship.
Testimony in the trial has not established conclusive levels for
any of the variables.
   The prosecution says Hazelwood spent seven hours drinking in a
Valdez bar before he set sail. The defense says he was in the bar
no more than three hours. Prosecutors say he had five drinks; the
defense says he had two or three.
   Burr, an alcohol consultant and former police crime lab
specialist from Minneapolis, disputed Prouty's findings, saying
that if Hazelwood drank anything after the accident, ``there's
absolutely no validity'' in Prouty's results.
   But he conceded on cross-examination by Assistant District
Attorney Brent Cole that experienced drinkers often are able to
``mask'' the effects of alcohol.
   Cole challenged the qualifications of both experts, suggesting
their credentials were inferior to Prouty's experience as a
toxicologist in Oklahoma.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration appears to be making a
stronger link between U.S. aid to Israel and its opposition to
Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, some members of
Congress say.
   The issue surfaced recently when Secretary of States James A.
Baker III was questioned about the administration's position on a
congressional proposal to help Israel raise $400 million to settle
Soviet immigrants.
   Under the proposal, Israel could borrow $400 million from
commercial lenders at below-market interest rates. The United
States would guarantee repayment of the 30-year loans.
   Baker told the House appropriations subcommittee on foreign
operations that the administration might be able to support the
legislation ``if the government provides some assurance it would
not be engaging in any new or additional settlement activity in the
territories.''
   The occupied territories are in the West Bank and Gaza, lands
seized by Israel after the Six-Day War in 1967. Arab leaders have
voiced concern that the thousands of Soviet Jewish immigrants
flocking to Israel might move to the territories.
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., the subcommittee's chairman, said
Israeli officials have said ``they don't feel they can give those
flat-out assurances.''
   But Obey said the Israelis have promised that ``very, very few
refugees, less than 10 percent'' would move to the territories.
   President Bush says he will endorse the housing investment
guarantee proposal only if the United States and Israel ``can work
out assurances'' that satisfy Washington on Jewish settlements in
the West Bank and Gaza.
   Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., said he saw a ``subtle change here
in administration policy'' on the Jewish settlements.
   He spelled out what he saw as the change: The United States has
long opposed Jewish settlements in the territories and has insisted
that Israel not spend U.S. money on construction there. Israel has
always made such guarantees and is prepared to do so again.
   But now, he said, the administration seems to be saying it wants
to ensure that Israel doesn't spent any money _ money from other
sources as well as U.S. aid _ on new settlements.
   ``We have never attempted to tie any of our assistance to how
the Israelis spent their money on (Jewish) settlements'' in the
occupied territories, Berman said.
   Thomas A. Dine, executive director of the American Israel Public
Affairs Committee, a lobby for U.S. aid to Israel, said
administration officials are telling Israel ``we want an assurance
that you won't put any of your own ... resources into the
territories.''
   ``This is telling a democratic society that it must limit the
freedom of movement of its people in order to get U.S.
assistance,'' Dine said. ``This is holding housing-for-Soviet-Jews
hostage so we can reopen an old debate about settlements.''
   However, Faris Bouhafa, a spokesman for the American Arab
Anti-Discrimination Committee, praised the administration for
standing firm on the settlement issue. Building Jewish settlements
in the territories is a ``violation of international law,'' he said.
   Israel has asked for financial help to cope with the thousands
of Jewish immigrants fleeing the Soviet Union.
   Some 11,000 immigrants have arrived this year, and up to 250,000
refugees are projected to come to Israel over the next few years.

   Redoubt Volcano erupted again today,
hurling gritty volcanic ash some 30,000 feet into the sky, where
wind blew it toward Alaska's largest city, officials say.
   Ed Wolfe, a spokesman for the Alaska Volcano Observatory, called
it a ``modest eruption,'' similar in energy to one that occurred
Friday.
   ``We recorded it for about 20 minutes,'' Wolfe said.
   ``We have pilot reports of a plume with some ash in it up to
30,000 feet or more,'' he said. ``Wind trajectories indicate the
ash will move to the northeast in the direction of Anchorage.''
   He said there was a fair possibility that some of the abrasive
grit would fall on Anchorage, but he didn't know how much ash was
in the plume.
   Redoubt Volcano is 115 miles southwest of Anchorage.
   The volcano was quiet for 25 years until a series of eruptions
began in mid-December, disrupting air travel and mail in and out of
Anchorage during the holidays because the airborne volcanic ash can
damage and stall aircraft engines.

<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle, whose meeting
with Nicaragua's Marxist President Daniel Ortega ended years of
U.S. estrangement, said Wednesday he will not repeat the gesture
with Cuba's Fidel Castro.
   Both Castro and Quayle are attending Thursday's presidential
inauguration in Brazil. But Quayle told reporters, ``We're not
going to meet with Castro. We have no desire to meet with Castro.''
   He responded to a reporter's question about Castro before
leaving Argentina for Brasilia. Brazil is the last stop on his
week-long South American trip, which included a 90-minute talk
Monday in Chile with Ortega.
   Quayle and Ortega discussed the upcoming transfer of power when
Ortega leaves office April 25.
   Arriving in Brasilia for the inauguration of Fernando Collor de
Mello, Quayle stopped at the American School for an anti-drug pep
talk to students.
   Earlier in the day, he said in Buenos Aires that ``very serious
consideration'' was being given to having President Bush visit
Argentina in the fall.
   Administration sources have said that a multi-nation
presidential trip is under consideration, possibly also including
Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela.
   At his Buenos Aires news conference, Quayle repeated his
contention that Castro is increasingly isolated.
   ``Eventually democracy and freedom will come to Cuba,'' Quayle
predicted. ``Castro must sooner or later change.''
   Quayle asked Argentine President Carlos Menem to press Castro to
halt arms shipments to leftist rebels in El Salvador.
   Discussing Argentina's grim economic status, Quayle suggested
the United States might consider a bridge loan after Argentina
fulfills internal economic conditions required by the International
Monetary Fund.
   The IMF has been holding up a $1.4 billion loan it granted
Argentina last year pending progress by Buenos Aires against
rampant inflation and toward deficit reduction.
   Asked about rumors of a $400 million bridge loan, Quayle said,
``Before we discuss the bridge loan it has to be bridged to
something. That something is the IMF arrangment.''
   Quayle said he was ``deeply impressed with President Menem's
commitment to economic reform.''
   He repeated U.S. vows of moral support for Argentina, which is
best by a monthly inflation rate of 70 percent, strikes, looting of
food stores, high unemployment and falling wages.

   Foreign Minister Farouk Sharaa met with
former President Jimmy Carter on Wednesday and repeated his
country's commitment to helping free foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   ``As we did exert a lot of efforts in the past to gain the
release of so many hostages ... we are still continuing to exert
such intensive efforts,'' Sharaa told reporters after greeting
Carter at Damascus International Airport.
   The two later held talks at the Foreign Ministry.
   Carter, who arrived from Egypt, was due to meet President Hafez
Assad before going to Jordan on Friday. He is to finish his
regional tour in Israel.
   Sharaa said he was ``not pessimistic'' that the 18 Westerners
held in Lebanon will be freed. But Carter noted that Iranian
officials believed to have influence over hostage-holders have made
contradictory statements in recent days.
   ``One day it's a positive statement. The next day it's a
rejection of a positive statement,'' he said. ``But I don't think
there's any doubt that the leaders of Iran have a great influence
on the future of the hostages,'' Carter added.
   Syria has roughly 40,000 troops in Lebanon and is the main power
broker in the country, but its allies are often at odds with groups
believed to hold the hostages.
   Carter, whose own presidency was marred by U.S. diplomats held
hostage in Iran, said Syrian leaders were ``very eager to see the
hostage question solved.''
   ``I think its best for relations all around, including the
future of Iran, as well as Lebanon...to see the hostage question
resolved,'' Carter said.
   The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   To mark the fifth anniversary of Anderson's abduction, eight
former French hostages urged the world to remember the Westerners
still held captive and expressed hope Wednesday for their speedy
liberation.
   Journalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann drafted the text, which was
distributed by the journalists' organization Reporters Without
Borders.
   The hostages ``are chained. They wear a blindfold around their
eyes. Their cells have no windows. They haven't seen the sun for
years,'' wrote Kauffmann.
   ``But the worst of their sufferings is to feel abandoned by
everyone. It's the silence that prolongs the ordeal of these people
we have known and with whom we have suffered,'' he wrote.
   The letter was signed by Kauffmann, Roger Auque, Marcel Carton,
Aurel Cornea, Marcel Fontaine, Georges Hansen, Jean-Louis Normandin
and Philippe Rochot.
   On other issues, Carter said he hoped for ``a comprehensive
settlement of all the issues'' between Israel and its neighbors,
including Syria. The former president sponsored the 1978 Camp David
accords that led to the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty.
   Carter said a U.S. plan for Israeli-Palestinian talks that led
to the collapse of Israel's feuding coalition government Tuesday
would be ``a precedent-setting first step which we hope would lead
to even broader agreements in the future.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel's hard-line Likud bloc
opposes plans to include in the talks Palestinians from east
Jerusalem, which Israel annexed after capturing it from Jordan in
1967.

   Musher Susan Butcher crossed the finish line
today to claim her fourth victory in the last five years in the
1,158-mile Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.
   Her victory, in record time, turned the tables on defending
champion Joe Runyan, who edged her last year at the finish of the
Anchorage-to-Nome race. Runyan trailed Butcher on the trail by more
than an hour.
   ``She just had a better plan,'' said Libby Riddles, the first
woman to win the race in 1985, watching the finish on the sunny
streets of this Gold Rush-era town. ``She outraced these guys. She
maintained her dog team better.
   ``It's an incredible unbelievable high,'' Riddles said. ``You go
thorugh all those ups and downs on the way to Nome. You can't
believe you've done it till you get there.''
   Smiling as she ran beside her dogs in her bright red snowsuit,
the 33-year-old Butcher finished the race shortly before 11 a.m.
Her official time was 11 days, 1 hour, 53 minutes, 23 seconds,
beating both her record for the route taken this year and her
overall record for all Iditarod races.
   Earlier, following a mandatory six-hour rest, Butcher left the
White Mountain checkpoint 77 miles from the finish one hour 20
minutes ahead of Runyan.
   She stopped for only three minutes at Safety to move a few dogs
to different positiions in the harness before striking out on the
last 22-mile leg of the race at 8:36 a.m. AST.
   ``It's Runyan who I have to worry about,'' Butcher said while
still on the trail. ``He has a hot team, but he's got to get ahead
of me.''
   Butcher had dropped another dog at Elim, leaving her with 11
dogs to Runyan's 15 over the last 123 miles of the race.
   Butcher's time handily broke the speed record for the identical
route in 1986 _ 11 days, 15 hours and six minutes. Her 1987
Iditarod record of 11 days 2 hours 5 minutes was set on an
alternate route.
   Anticipating today's finish, Iditarod organizers spent Tuesday
hanging traditional trail's end banners and setting up the racers'
chute on Front Street in Nome.
   Lavon Barve reached White Mountain in third place.
   Four-time winner Rick Swenson was reported out of the checkpoint
at Elim, while Tim Osmar, Robin Jacobson and DeeDee Jonrowe were at
the checkpoint 123 miles from the finish.
   The leaders have switched to lightweight sprint sleds, instead
of the heavier long-distance sleds they began the race with at
Anchorage on March 3.
   First prize is $50,000, with the rest of the $200,000 purse
divided among the next 19 finishers.
   Teams bucked a stiff sidewind across the ice pack Tuesday night
and drove through near whiteout conditions that are common on the
Sound.
   Butcher had expressed hopes of finishing in under 11 days.
   ``I'll have to see how this team responds going over White
Mountain before I go for the all-time record,'' she had said
earlier.
   Named for an abandoned gold-mining town along the trail, the
Iditarod was started in 1973 to commemorate the 1925 emergency
delivery of life-saving diphtheria serum from Anchorage to Nome by
sled dog teams running in relays.
   Of the 70 teams that began the race, seven mushers have
scratched and another was disqualified because of sick dogs.

<TEXT>
   The British director of a new musical about Martin
Luther King has resigned from the troubled show, publicists for
``King'' announced Wednesday.
   Press officer Peter Thompson said no reason was given for Graham
Vick's decision, which was made Tuesday night.
   Vick's departure is the latest in a series of problems that have
beset the show, scheduled to open April 11 at the Piccadilly
Theater. American opera singer Simon Estes is to play the slain
civil rights leader.
   The musical's original director, Germany's Gotz Friedrich,
withdrew in January because of exhaustion.
   Around the same time, writer Ron Milner was replaced with
Richard Nelson.
   Last week, the King estate in Atlanta, Georgia, announced its
opposition to the show, saying in a statement that the musical
``trivializes Dr. King's legacy.''
   In an apparently independent decision, lyricist Maya Angelou
withdrew her support. Speaking through spokesman Armstrong
Williams, she claimed that the show reduced its subject to ``some
not-so-smart slickster.''
   British composer Richard Blackford, who has spent 6{ years on
``King,'' has defended the show all along, calling it a ``portrayal
of a great man done in a very great way.''

<HEAD>Twisters in Kansas, Heat Wave Elsewhere: Make Way For Spring</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Tornadoes gobbled up farmhouses as they veered through the
Plains on the second day of a record heat wave that brought
strollers to parks and sidewalk cafes in the East and Midwest.
   The funnel clouds plowed through Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa,
Oklahoma and Texas on Tuesday, killing two people, injuring at
least 22 and wrecking scores of houses.
   One tornado ripped a 100-mile path in a 2{-hour tear through
southeastern Kansas. It lingered in Hesston, Kan., a town of 3,000
people, long enough to damage 75 to 100 houses. A 6-year-old boy
died and a mother and her teen-age son were missing today.
   Thunderstorms brought flood warnings early today to Oklahoma,
Iowa, Wisconsin and Illinois. Walnut-sized hail fell at Groom,
Texas.
   The funnel-spinning warm front brought balmy weather to much of
the country east of the Rockies.
   ``I always feel confused when I feel good in the unusually warm
weather we're having nowadays, because I know it's related to the
greenhouse effect,'' said Ellen Spiro, a New York video maker.
   The National Weather Service said the heat came from a
high-pressure system pumping Gulf of Mexico air northward.
   A full week before the first day of spring, summer came to New
York City. The high of 85 was 38 degrees above normal and 15
degrees higher than the 1929 record.
   Lenny and Robin Wayne, tourists from Los Angeles, took a few
spins around the Rockefeller Center ice skating rink and left early.
   ``It's too hot to ice skate,'' Wayne said.
   ``It makes you want to fall on the ice,'' his wife said.
   The warmth was expected to last until Thursday, then ``it'll
just get a little cooler,'' said meteorologist Robert McElhearn.
   Michigan hardware stores that were selling rock salt and snow
shovels two weeks ago shifted gears Tuesday, as customers started
buying fertilizer and seeds. ``But they aren't buying fans yet,''
said Mike Manning, a salesman at Pointe Hardware store in Grosse
Pointe Park.
   Record highs for the date were registered in Atlantic City,
N.J., where it was 86; Baltimore 85; Charlotte, N.C., 86; Chicago
71; Cleveland, 76; Concord, N.H., 69; Detroit 73; Indianapolis 75;
Montgomery, Ala., 85; Norfolk, Va., 84; Philadelphia 84;
Providence, R.I., 77; Raleigh-Durham, N.C. 88; Richmond, Va., 89;
Rochester, Minn., 63, and Washington, D.C., 87.
   In Hesston, the 6-year-old who died was one of seven people
huddled in a basement when the chimney and fireplace crashed
through. The boy's 12-year-old brother was injured.
   The same tornado killed an elderly woman near Goessel, Kan., 10
miles from Hesston, and damaged 19 farmhouses in surrounding Marion
County, said Sheriff Ed Davies.
   At a church in the north Texas town of Elbert, officials
monitoring the gubernatorial primary vote took a breather Tuesday
to watch a tornado.
   ``We just stood in the rain and watched it go by,'' said
election judge Bernard Gilmore. The twister caused no major damage.
   At least nine Iowa counties were visited by twisters, including
one that destroyed a firehouse, 10 homes and three businesses in
Worthington, near Dubuque. Fifty residents were given shelter by
the Red Cross.
   Tornadoes wrecked part of Lawrence, Neb., injuring three people,
and derailed 24 empty Burlington Northern Railroad cars near Grand
Island.
   Authorities declared a disaster area at Sutton, Neb., after a
twister ruptured a tank of dangerous anhydrous ammonia.
   Meanwhile, up to 8 inches of snow fell late Tuesday in the
Nebraska Panhandle. Snow also blanketed parts of Montana, Idaho,
Arizona and Colorado.

   Here's an insight that may fail to shock dedicated
students of the mating game: People often tell lies in order to
have sex. Honest.
   Two California researchers reached that conclusion about dating
behavior after taking a survey of college students.
   They say it's a point worth keeping in mind when trying to
decide whether potential sexual partners have ever done anything to
put themselves at risk of AIDS.
   In the survey, 34 percent of male respondents and 10 percent of
women admitted they had ``told a lie in order to have sex.'' Even
more said they would lie if a situation arose where it would be to
their advantage.
   The researchers noted that young people are advised to choose
sexual partners who are at low risk of infection with HIV, the AIDS
virus. One way to do this is to question partners about their
sexual pasts.
   ``The implications of our findings are clear,'' they wrote in
Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. ``Patients should be
cautioned that safe-sex strategies are always advisable, despite
arguments to the contrary from partners.''
   The survey, which gave no margin of error, was based on
questionnaires filled out by 196 men and 226 women at colleges in
southern California. It was conducted by Drs. Susan D. Cochran of
California State University in Northridge and Vickie M. Mays of the
University of California, Los Angeles. They published their results
in a letter to the journal.
   In the survey, 47 percent of the men and 60 percent of the women
believed they had been lied to for purposes of sex.
   Asked about hypothetical situations, many people said they would
be willing to tell lies. For instance, 20 percent of the men and 4
percent of the women said they would lie about having negative AIDS
tests.
   Forty-three percent of the men and 34 percent of the women said
they would never disclose a single episode of cheating; 47 percent
of the men and 42 percent of the women said they would understate
the number of previous sex partners.
   ``One can probably assume that their reports of their own
dishonesty underestimate rather than overestimate the problem,''
added the researchers, who also presented their findings in 1988 at
the annual meeting of the American Psychological Association.

<HEAD>Six Nations Agree to Invite Poland to Unification Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World War II victors and the two
Germanys formally agreed Wednesday to invite Poland to their talks
on German reunification when questions concerning that country's
borders come up.
   The decision was reached at the first formal meeting of the
Soviet Union, the United States, Britain and France and the two
German states on reunification.
   The middle-level talks were part of the so-called
``two-plus-four'' meetings in which the six nations will examine
the enormously complex difficulties involved in German unity.
   Among those issues are the Soviet Union's insistence that a
united Germany not be a NATO member, and the fear of some West
European nations that their own interests might be overlooked.
   Another is Poland's worry that a united Germany might try to
claim land ceded to Poland after the defeat of Nazi Germany in
1945. The land comprises about one-third of present-day Poland.
   Poland had demanded a seat on the unification talks, but until
Tuesday West Germany opposed that idea.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl had angered the Poles with
his previous reluctance to state unequivocally a united Germany
would not seek to claim the Polish land. He has since said a united
Germany must sign a treaty guaranteeing Poland's borders, but the
Poles are still dissatisfied with his latest stand.
   In the East German city of Leipzig, meanwhile, about 300,000
people attended a rally to cheer Kohl and his unification program.
   Dieter Kastrup, head of the West German delegation at
Wednesday's talks, said the officials decided Poland should be
included during some parts of the two-plus-four discussions.
   ``The participants were agreed that Poland should be invited as
soon as questions are discussed that especially concern its
border,'' Kastrup said.
   Kastrup said the officials held a ``serious exchange of
opinions'' on the agenda for future meetings of the six nations,
and that details of the talks would be kept confidential.
   According to Kastrup, the nations decided to alternate the site
of the talks between West Germany and East Germany, and that the
next round would take place ``directly'' after East Germany's
elections on Sunday. No precise date was given.
   Ministerial-level talks by the six nations are also planned
under the two-plus-four formula, agreed to last month. The East
German ADN news agency said those will begin sometime in late April.
   Eighteen officials from the six nations met for more than seven
hours inside the West German Foreign Ministry. The conferees met in
the afternoon with West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher.
   ``The start of these talks is for us Germans a moving occasion,
reminding us how much the situation has changed in Europe,''
Genscher said.
   French President Francois Mitterrand, who had been backing
Poland's demand for a part in the talks, telephoned Kohl on
Wednesday to discuss Poland's participation, said West German
government spokesman Hans Klein.
   Besides Krabatsch and Kastrup, other officials attending the
Bonn talks were Robert Zoellick, counselor for the U.S. State
Department; Anatoly Adamischin, Soviet deputy foreign minister;
John Weston, political director at the British Foreign Office; and
Bertrand Dufourcq, political director for the French Foreign
Ministry.

   Suppose they held an election and no one
voted.
   That's what happened Tuesday when no one showed up for the
Republican primary in this west Texas town, population 60.
   But election officials at Precinct 34 in southwest Taylor County
weren't really surprised. Only one person voted in the previous
primaries.
   Shep's only Republican voter developed cancer and was sent to a
hospital in Houston, said county GOP chairman Brent Casey.
   The man had been the only GOP voter in primaries in 1986 and
1988.
   Before 1986, there wasn't even a voting place for Republicans in
Shep, 250 miles west of Dallas. Republicans had to vote in another
precinct.
   Officials opened the Republican polling place Tuesday hoping to
attract other voters, who were allowed to decide at the last minute
whether to vote in the Democratic or Republican gubernatorial
primary.
   ``We had really hoped that Clayton Williams might draw some
people out there because it is a farming community,'' said Casey's
mother, Betty, the precinct's election judge. Williams won the GOP
gubernatorial nomination and is a rancher.
   ``But it is difficult for people who have been Democratic for
years and years to have Republican stamped on their voter
registration.''
   It was a long, boring day for the election judges as they waited
for voters who never appeared.
   ``We did a lot of reading,'' Mrs. Casey said.

<HEAD>West Germany to Stop Special Program for East German Immigrants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Wednesday it plans
to end a massive government program for newly arriving East
Germans, apparently in response to pressure to stop the influx.
   Legal groundwork for the move is being laid in anticipation of
improved conditions in East Germany after elections Sunday,
Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told a news conference.
   Schaeuble said his government hopes the elections and proposed
monetary union between the two countries will end the westward
exodus of East Germans seeking a better life.
   But he stressed the aid will ``only be discontinued when we no
longer need it.''
   The program includes lodging immigrants in special centers,
low-interest loans for them, and a one-time cash gift of $117 to
get started on a new life.
   About 138,000 East Germans have moved to West Germany so far
this year, Schaeuble said. An average of 2,500 East Germans still
arrive daily. Last year, there were 344,000 settlers from East
Germany.
   The flood has severely sapped East Germany's battered economy
and strained West Germany's social services as well as job and
housing markets.
   Several West German state and local governments have already put
a temporary halt to acceptance of East German resettlers, saying
their communities were overburdened.

<HEAD>Democrats Dismiss Rostenkowski's Plan, Question White House
Reaction</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Democrats on Wednesday brushed aside a
budget proposal by one of their most powerful members and expressed
skepticism about White House motivations for publicizing it.
   At a closed party caucus attended by more than 100 lawmakers,
Democrats said they debated spending priorities including how
deeply to cut Pentagon spending in their fiscal 1991 budget
resolution.
   They emphasized that the resolution, not the plan put forward
last weekend by Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski,
would be their party's position if President Bush wants to
negotiate.
   Rostenkowski, D-Ill., proposed eliminating the federal deficit
by freezing most domestic spending for a year, including Social
Security; cutting military spending, and raising income taxes and
fees on gasoline and alcoholic beverages.
   Bush and his top staff seized on the Rostenkowski plan, telling
reporters the administration wants to negotiate even though
officials disagree with most of the specifics, such as raising
taxes and freezing Social Security's cost-of-living adjustments.
   Democrats hailed the Rostenkowski plan for drawing attention to
the federal deficit, but made clear Wednesday they didn't think it
was a winner except as a political tool for the Republicans.
   ``Rostenkowski showed that there's some life in the Democratic
Party,'' said Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark.
   Asked if Democrats were ready to embrace the plan, he said,
``No, no, no,'' adding, ``What's the use?'' if Bush would just use
the plan to attack Democrats.
   Rep. Larry Smith, D-Fla., said the administration was hyping the
Rostenkowski plan ``because it's good for them politically.''
   ``The White House has been looking for these kind of things
instead of an honest debate on the issues,'' he said.
   ``They'd love to have that as the bargaining position'' of the
Democrats, said House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta,
D-Calif.
   ``I think they feel they have something to gain by being nice to
Danny. ... He might be nicer to them later about other things'' in
his committee, said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass. ``I also think they
don't mind having a prominent Democrat talk about raising taxes. I
think that fits into their political agenda.''
   The president's assistants continued their efforts Wednesday to
convince lawmakers that the White House would be serious about
budget negotiations this year.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, in an appearance before the
House Appropriations Committee, called Rostenkowski's plan one
``that we can operate on.''
   While maintaining that Bush made his opposition to tax increases
quite clear, Brady also said, ``The president has said that he is
not going to put anything off the table'' in negotating with
Congress over the budget.
   Richard Darman, Bush's budget director, met with a group of
budget-conscious House members led by Rep. Tim Penny, D-Wis. ``I
was left with the sense they will be more flexible on the tax issue
than may have been previously evident,'' Penny said.
   But leading Democrats said they were in no mood to read tea
leaves.
   ``Nodding and blinking and winking won't do it,'' said Rep.
William H. Gray III, D-Pa., the House majority whip. ``If they feel
that a bold approach is supportable, they ought to say so.''
   Rostenkowski, in an appearance on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show,
complained about ``timidity on Capitol Hill that is somewhat
frightening.'' He called on citizens to contact their
representatives.
   Rostenkowski's office said his mail was running strongly in
favor of the plan.

<HEAD>North Continues Testimony in Poindexter Trial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Oliver L. North testified Wednesday that he
didn't ``feel good'' after lying to Congress to conceal secret aid
to the Nicaraguan Contras even though he was praised by his boss,
John Poindexter.
   North concluded 3{ days of testimony at Poindexter's Iran-Contra
cover-up trial by insisting that he violated no laws by lying
during the Aug. 6, 1986, meeting at the White House with members of
House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.
   But the former National Security Council aide told prosecutor
Dan Webb that he didn't ``recall having any emotion'' when he
received a note from Poindexter after the meeting that said: ``Well
done.''
   ``When John Poindexter told you `well done,' did you expect he
had been happy you had carried the water?'' Webb asked. ``Did you
think you did well?''
   ``No, I've told the world I don't feel good about that,'' the
retired Marine lieutenant colonel said, his voice cracking with
emotion.
   Poindexter, a retired Navy rear admiral who was President
Reagan's national security adviser in 1986, is accused of
obstructing congressional inquiries into the U.S.-Iran arms sales
and the secret operation set up to channel aid to the Nicaraugan
Contras.
   North conceded that what he did as wrong, but not illegal.
   ``You thought you could go in front of those 12 congressmen and
lie and lie and lie?'' Webb asked, raising his voice for the first
time while questioning North.
   ``I was not under oath, I have never lied, it was an informal
meeting,'' North said.
   ``Did you think this was a tea party going on over there in the
White House Situation Room?'' Webb asked.
   ``No, counsel, I knew it wasn't a tea party,'' North said.
   North, who was declared a hostile witness when he began
testifying Friday, earlier said Poindexter told him ``you can
handle it'' when he objected to going to the meeting. But he balked
at Webb's suggestion that he was under orders to lie.
   ``I never thought it was a good idea to start the process of
answering their questions,'' North said.
   ``You're not going to change your testimony that you gave this
jury two days ago to help your former boss?'' Webb asked.
   ``No sir,'' North said.
   North said Poindexter was one of the few people who knew he lied.
   ``Did Ronald Reagan, George Bush, the generals or the admirals,
did any of them send you messages that said ``well done'' after you
lied to Congress on Aug. 6, 1986?'' Webb asked.
   ``No,'' North replied.
   A key piece of evidence is a note to Poindexter from National
Security Council staffer Robert Pearson detailing false information
North provided about his Contra-related activities to members of
the House committee during the Aug. 6 meeting.
   The false statements itemized in the note were that North hadn't
seen Contra supporter John Singlaub in 20 months, didn't meet with
any frequency with Contra liaison Robert Owen and didn't offer
military advice to the rebels.
   ``Admiral Poindexter would have no idea how often you met with
Singlaub, would he?'' asked Poindexter's lawyer, Richard Beckler.
   ``No, those are the kinds of details I ... didn't bother the
admiral with,'' North said.
   U.S. District Judge Harold Greene seem mystified when North told
Beckler that he destroyed documents in his office to protect the
covert operation to assist the Contras when it was exposed in
October 1986 when a transport plane carrying arms was shot down
over Nicaragua.
   ``The people who were going to look at it, if the documents were
not destroyed were not the KGB and Castro, but the attorney general
or the Congress of the United States,'' Greene said.
   Later, the judge showed exasperation when North couldn't recall
in detail how he shredded documents in the days before he was fired
by Reagan on Nov. 25, 1986, after the Iran-Contra affair had
unraveled.
   North had a vivid recollection of those events when he testified
at his own trial last year, when he was convicted of aiding and
abetting an obstruction of Congress and the destruction of
government documents.
   ``Didn't that weekend stick out in your mind since it resulted
in your being fired?'' Greene asked North, who insisted his
recollection was vague.

<HEAD>Makeshift Parliament Passes Free Elections Law</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The interim parliament passed a new
election law Wednesday giving Romanians the legal right to free
balloting and representative government for the first time in more
than half a century.
   The law governs the May 20 elections to choose a bicameral
parliament with a prime minister, and a popularly elected
president. Its passage came after interim President Ion Iliescu
fought opposition moves to postpone the vote until fall.
   ``From now on, we are on the straightway in our campaign,''
Iliescu told delegates to the parliament, officially known as the
Council of National Unity.
   The new law formally established universal suffrage in this
nation of 23 million, enfranchising anyone 18 years of age by the
end of the year.
   Parliament's lower house will have 387 members, elected
according to both regional and proportional representation. In
deference to the military's role in the December pro-democracy
revolution, the Army High Command will name 15 deputies.
   Senate membership is to depend on a census of the nation's 42
counties, with two senators for every county up to 500,000
inhabitants, and three for counties with populations above that
figure. The capital will have 14 senators.
   At last count, 52 political parties and organizations had
registered. The National Salvation Front, the National Peasants
Party, the National Liberal Party and the Social Democratic Party
were considered the frontrunners.
   The Front has had the major voice in running Romania since it
took power in the revolution that toppled dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu.
   It put Iliescu in power, set up the current provisional
government, and has dominated the 253-member temporary parliament.
   The debate over the electoral law gave Romanians their first
taste of legislative give-and-take since before World War II.
Romania's last free elections were in 1937.
   The legislation was passed by an informal show of hands in the
vaulted chamber where Ceausescu's tame National Assembly used to
meet. There were three negative votes.
   Major opposition parties had argued that a May election was too
soon after the revolution and gave the National Salvation Front an
unfair advantage, but Iliescu prevailed. U.N. observers will be
invited to monitor the vote.
   Like the government and parliament, the electoral law is
provisional and applies only to the May elections.
   The ensuing parliament will rewrite the constitution to replace
the Ceausescu-era document, and new elections will be held a year
after, Wednesday's law specified.
   The law effectively ruled out candidacy for anyone who was part
of Ceausescu's apparatus of repression.
   Delegates voted to bar any candidates who committed human rights
violations or were guilty of government-sponsored abuses before the
revolution. If citizens believe a particular candidate was part of
the Ceausescu repression, the law provides for a mechanism to allow
a court challenge.

   The Bush administration has delayed
prosecuting thousands of fraud cases by turning down some of the
money Congress offered to pursue savings and loan crooks, a House
subcommittee chairman contended Wednesday.
   Rep. Doug Barnard Jr., D-Ga., said 2,327 financial institution
fraud and embezzlement cases are inactive, meaning they are open
but are not being pursued because of a lack of investigators or
prosecutors.
   Of those, 1,298 involve alleged losses of $100,000 or more, he
said.
   S&amp;L legislation enacted in August authorized $75 million for
pursuing bank and thrift fraud this year, but the Justice
Department sought and received only $50 million, Barnard said at a
hearing of his House Government Operations subcommittee on
commerce, consumer and monetary affairs.
   The department devoted an additional 557 employees to pursuing
fraud _ 201 FBI agents, 118 attorneys and 238 clerks and other
support staff. But that was only a bit more than half of the 1,036
additional employees that field offices had said were needed to
handle the backlog, he said.
   ``Our analysis raises the question whether or not the Justice
Department will investigate and prosecute the thousand or more
major cases now on the back burner,'' Barnard said
   FBI divisions and U.S. attorney's offices in several areas,
including San Diego and Pittsburgh, asked for more employees but
received none, he said.
   ``Other areas did receive a large increase, but not nearly
enough to respond to the problem,'' he said. These included
Houston; Chicago; New Orleans; San Antonio, Texas; Miami, and
Boston, he said.
   ``I have some difficulty in accepting that an individual who
commits substantial fraud against an S&amp;L or bank may completely
escape investigation and prosecution if that person committed the
offense in an area which did not receive enough additional
resources,'' Barnard said.
   Robert J. Wortham, U.S. attorney for the eastern district of
Texas, said S&amp;L and bank failures in his region are going
uninvestigated.
   ``There's no one to go out and do the work,'' he said. ``We have
asked for resources and not received them. I could ask my mother to
do the work. She would be glad to go out there, but I don't know if
she would know what to do.''
   Justice Department officials are scheduled to appear before the
panel Thursday. A department spokesman had no immediate comment on
Barnard's complaints.

   An uninsured $140 million
communications satellite failed to separate from its launch rocket
Wednesday and orbited uselessly around Earth, launch officials said.
   Efforts were under way to separate the satellite and rocket with
signals from ground stations. While it is attached to the big Titan
3 that boosted it into orbit, the satellite cannot be fired into
the 22,300-mile-high orbit at which it must operate.
   ``Initial review of data suggest separation did not occur,''
Martin Marietta Corp. said in a one-sentence statement.
   Martin Marietta, which conducted the launch, earlier reported
that the satellite had separated, although the spacecraft failed to
send any signals back to Earth following the 6:52 a.m. EST launch.
   If the satellite were doomed, it would represent a total $270
million loss, including the cost of the rocket and launch.
   The satellite was intended to transmit up to 120,000 telephone
calls simultaneously for several companies and three television
channels for more than 13 years. It was to replace two older
satellites over the Atlantic.
   Don O'Neal, a spokesman for Hughes Aircraft Co., which built the
satellite, earlier said it could be days before the satellite was
declared a failure.
   ``It's not a failure until we can confirm some things here,''
said Martin Marietta spokeswoman Judy Stowell. ``An investigation
needs to occur.''
   The 5-ton satellite, nearly four stories tall with its antennas
and solar panels deployed, was boosted into orbit by Titan 3, the
most powerful U.S. commercial rocket. The rocket blasted off into a
cloudy sky from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.
   Launch commentator Bob Gordon, a spokesman for Martin Marietta,
reported 28 minutes after launch that it had separated from the
rocket as scheduled. A few minutes later, he said the separation
had not been confirmed.
   At 8:37 a.m., Gordon announced, ``We have just received
confirmation of deployment.'' The separation occurred 25 minutes
after launch, he said.
   Edward M. Browne, president of Martin Marietta Commercial Titan
Inc., said at a late morning news conference that despite the lack
of a signal, ``It looks like the rocket performed as it was
supposed to.''
   However, no data was received from the satellite when it was
scheduled to pass over a tracking station on Hawaii.
   Hughes earlier said it was not clear whether an on-board rocket
motor fired to send the satellite into a higher orbit, something
that could not have happened had the orbiter not separated from the
rocket. The motor normally would have fired before the satellite
sent its first signals back to Earth.
   The U.S. Space Command in Colorado, which tracks objects in
space, said it was asked by Martin Marietta to locate the satellite.
   ``We are performing our normal tracking function. We know where
it is,'' said Maj. Thomas Niemann, a command spokesman.
   Frederick Ormsby, spacecraft mission director for the
International Telecommunications Satellite Organization, or
Intelsat, said the not-for-profit international consortium had not
insured the satellite. Insuring satellites is prohibitively high,
especially since last month's explosion of an Ariane rocket.
   The unmanned Ariane rocket carrying two Japanese communications
satellites blew apart over the Atlantic shortly after taking off
from Kourou, French Guiana.
   The Intelsat VI that took off Wednesday was the fourth
commercial launch of a payload to orbit by an American company.
   The satellite was scheduled to reach final orbit 22,300 miles
above Earth on Sunday, and then undergo tests before being placed
in service in late May.
   The first Intelsat VI, launched October by the European Space
Agency's Ariane rocket, is being tested in orbit and will be placed
in service April 7.
   Wednesday's launch was the 44th for Intelsat, a Washington,
D.C.-based commercial cooperative of 118 member nations. The
cooperative owns and operates a global communications satellite
system used by more than 170 countries. The first Intelsat
communications satellite was launched 25 years ago next month.

   Lawmakers on Wednesday decided that they, rather
than the Soviet people, should elect the country's new, powerful
president. Mikhail S. Gorbachev was the only name on the ballot.
   Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov and Interior Minister Vadim A.
Bakatin were nominated for the post by a group calling itself
``Soyuz,'' or ``Union,'' which is opposed to efforts by Soviet
republics to break away. But both withdrew.
   Balloting was to begin Wednesday night and results were expected
Thursday morning.
   Gorbachev needed a simple majority in the 2,250-member Congress
of People's Deputies, the Soviet Parliament. On Tuesday it approved
his plan to greatly increase the powers of the presidency and
create a multiparty system.
   Gorbachev narrowly cleared a procedural vote Wednesday allowing
the parliament to elect him directly to a five-year term. He needed
1,497 votes in that vote.
   The final tally was 1,542-368 with 76 deputies abstaining. More
than 200 deputies either boycotted the vote or were absent, making
it even more difficult for Gorbachev to muster the required
two-thirds majority.
   If Gorbachev had lost, he would have been forced to face
disgruntled citizens in a national election campaign this year to
keep the job he has held since 1988.
   The decision to hold the emergency election in the Congress of
People's Deputies came after a respected scholar warned that the
Soviet Union was not yet ready for a nationwide presidential
campaign.
   Leningrad historian Dmitri Likhachev, considered by many the
dean of Soviet culture, said the country would face civil war if it
had to go through its first presidential election now.
   ``I remember the revolution of February (1917) very well, and I
know where emotions can lead,'' the 84-year-old Likhachev told the
deputies, referring to the revolution that ended more than 300
years of rule by the Romanov dynasty.
   ``Understand our conditions,'' he said. ``Direct election of the
president will lead to civil war.''
   Gorbachev was nominated for the post by the Communist Party
Central Committee, which met hurriedly during a break in the
session, the official Tass news agency said.
   Bakatin withdrew from the race when deputies began to debate his
candidacy. Ryzhkov told the Parliament he preferred to remain in
his present post.
   Several deputies took the floor to say they were appalled that
Parliament was unable to come up with a viable alternative to
Gorbachev.
   Under constitutional amendments approved Tuesday, the new
president will have wide powers to propose legislation, negotiate
treaties, veto bills and decisions of the Council of Ministers,
appoint a Cabinet, declare war if the country is attacked and under
certain conditions impose presidential rule.
   Gorbachev's latest political reform concentrates in one person
many of the powers now held collectively by the Presidium of the
Supreme Soviet legislature. Gorbachev, as chairman of the
Presidium, has been considered the country's president, but with
far less personal power.
   Most of his personal power still stems from his post as
Communist Party chief, but Gorbachev is trying to strengthen the
government while ending the party's lock on political power. There
is speculation that he eventually may give up the party leadership
and remain president.
   Likhachev warned that a proposal to force Gorbachev to resign
his chairmanship of the Communist Party if elected president would
pit the party against the state. He said that also could lead to
civil war.
   Sympathetic deputies broke into applause at the end of his
statement.
   Gorbachev previously has said a stronger presidency was needed
to hold the Soviet system together under the strains of economic
problems and ethnic disputes.

   Saying that ``the future vitality of our
nation'' depends on the quality of child care, a National Research
Council committee on Wednesday called for a $5 billion to $10
billion boost in government support for America's day care system.
   A 19-member NRC committee, in a report entitled ``Who Cares For
America's Children?'' also recommended that the government
establish strict national standards for day care centers.
   And, aiming to get parent-child relationships off to a good
start, it said the federal government should require companies to
allow unpaid, job-protected leave for employed parents of infants
up to one year old.
   The report said that more than half of all American parents now
entrust their young children to the care of others during part of
the day, and that by the year 2000 between 70 percent and 80
percent of all American children will have mothers in the work
force.
   ``Every American child not only deserves quality care, the
future vitality of our nation depends on it,'' said the committee's
chairman, John L. Palmer, a professor at the Maxwell School of
Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University.
   Quality of child care can affect the well-being of virtually a
generation of American children, the report said, because the
nation now depends on working mothers as a permanent part of the
economic structure.
   ``Women in the work force are here to stay,'' said Dr. Jack P.
Shonkoff, a professor of pediatrics at the University of
Massachusetts Medical School and a member of the committee. ``We
need them in the work force. But we must make sure that families
have quality child care available.''
   Shonkoff said careful study showed no evidence that day care in
the first year of life is detrimental to children if the quality is
good. But poor quality care, he said, has been shown to put
children ``at risk of poor outcomes'' in life, including slow
progress in school, inappropriate aggression, a lack of job skills
and a greater tendency to drop out of school.
   ``Of particular interest is the finding that out-of-home quality
child care can offset to some extent the detrimental effects on
development of a stressful, impoverished home environment,'' said
Palmer. ``The bottom line of this research is that quality matters
in child care.''
   The report called for a uniform national standard for child
care. This could include minimum safety and health standards, along
with acceptable ranges for staff-to-child ratios, group size,
caregiver qualifications and physical space.
   The committee repeatedly said in its 347-page report that there
is a scarcity of quality child care in the U.S., but committee
member Barbara Bowman of the Erikson Institute in Chicago said
there are no comprehensive statistics on this.
   She said more than half of all children of working parents are
cared for in facilities that are unregulated, and as a result,
national data is lacking.
   Research in limited areas showed that only about 20 percent of
care arrangements ``meet the standards of good or better,'' but
this cannot be extended to the nation as a whole, Ms. Bowman said.
   Children from ``disadvantaged'' families, the report said, are
more apt to be entrusted to low quality child care because the
higher quality care is expensive.
   Committee member Andrew Cherlin, professor of sociology at Johns
Hopkins University in Baltimore, said that although child care
legislation was passed in the 1980s, the federal help is in the
form of tax credits that benefit middle and upper class families _
not the poor that need help the most.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., called the NRC report ``right
on the mark'' and said it shows that Congress should ``break the
stalemate'' by passing legislation to assure quality child care.
   A bill was passed by the Senate last fall, but a similar measure
is now stalled in the House.
   Helen Blank of the Children's Defense Fund said the NRC report
shows that Congress ``is still behind the curve'' in attempting to
correct the nation's child care problems.
   She said a bill currently in committee in the House would
provide about $1.75 billion in child care subsidies
   The NRC committee said governments at all levels need to
increase support of quality child care, in various forms, by an
additional $5 billion to $10 billion a year. The committee made no
specific recommendation of how the money was to be spent or
distributed.
   On Capitol Hill, congressional staffers said House leaders were
moving toward agreement on a compromise bill, with House Speaker
Thomas S. Foley pressing key members to resolve differences on the
bill.
   The staffers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said leaders
of the Education and Labor Committee were expected to agree to a
Ways and Means Committee proposal to finance child care in the
states through increased money for an existing block grant
entitlement program rather than through direct aid.
   Ms. Blank said the bill now being considered by the House would
not mandate specific child care center standards but would require
states to have some standards and would make recommendations about
what they should be.
   The National Research Council is an organization of the National
Academy of Sciences, a private society of scholars chartered by
Congress with a mandate to advise the federal government on
scientific and technical matters.

<HEAD>U.S. Rejects Mandela's Call To Break Ties With South Africa</HEAD>

   The United States rejected on Wednesday
demands by Nelson Mandela, the prominent black activist, for a
break in relations with South Africa and stiffer economic sanctions
in the hope of forcing an end to racial separation in the country.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, meanwhile, made
arrangements for a five-hour visit to Capetown next Thursday for
talks with President F.W. de Klerk, Anglican Bishop Desmond Tutu
and other black opponents of apartheid.
   Baker has invited Mandela to meet with him in Namibia on Tuesday
or Wednesday while the secretary of state is attending ceremonies
in Windhoek marking the independence of the former South African
colony.
   Mandela, freed last month from prison by de Klerk after serving
27 years, has been on a visit to Stockholm and has not formalized
arrangements to see Baker in Windhoek, said a U.S. official who
spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   Baker flies to Namibia on Sunday. He has scheduled a meeting in
Zaire with President Mobutu Sese Seko before flying back to
Washington on March 23.
   Baker also may see President Jose Eduardo dos Santos of Angola
in Namibia and Jonas Savimbi, the leader of a U.S.-backed rebel
movement against the Angolan government, in Zaire, the official
said.
   On Tuesday, Mandela called on foreign governments to break
diplomatic relations with South Africa and to impose tougher
economic sanctions to speed political change in the country.
   Rejecting the demands, Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State
Department spokeswoman, said:
   ``We believe it is more constructive to continue our relations
with South Africa. We have played a helpful role in supporting
negotiations between these parties. We do not believe that this is
the best way to pursue being constructive and helpful in this
area.''
   Similarly, on Mandela's call for tougher sanctions, Ms. Tutwiler
read from a statement: ``We believe we can best play a helpful role
in support of negotiations by maintaining contacts with both
sides.''
   Besides, the spokeswoman said, the Bush administration intends
to comply with a 1986 law requiring South Africa to free all
political prisoners, repeal the 3{-year-old state of emergency and
make other reforms before the sanctions can be lifted.
   ``These things have not yet been done and we intend ... to
follow the law in close consultation with Congress,'' Ms. Tutwiler
said.
   Mandela said in Stockholm on Tuesday that ``the help that we
require firstly is an intensification of sanctions and, secondly,
the cutting of diplomatic ties with South Africa. ...''
   The statement read by Ms. Tutwiler said the call for stiffer
sanctions historically has been the position of the African
National Congress ``and Mr. Mandela has been careful not to depart
from it.''
   However, the spokeswoman added, ``Mr. Mandela and the ANC have
also made clear they appreciate the role Western countries with
relations with South Africa have played in pressing Pretoria for an
end to apartheid.''

   Greeted by sirens and shouts, Susan Butcher
stormed into this Gold Rush town Wednesday in sub-zero weather and
record time to rack up her fourth victory in five years in the
1,158 mile Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.
   Butcher, 33, of Manley, became only the second four-time winner
of the 18-year-old Anchorage-to-Nome marathon.
   Butcher was running about two hours ahead of defending champion
Joe Runyan of Nenana, a reversal of positions from the 1989 finish.
   Runyan won that race with a one-hour, five-minute cushion over
Butcher.
   Butcher finished with 11 dogs. During her 11 days on the trail
she had to drop three veteran dogs that pulled her to her previous
victories. She credited her unknown canines for the victory.
   ``This team has been absolutely incredible,'' Butcher said.
``I've never had a team go as strong as this.
   ``I don't know what's in that team that could do it, but it must
be the combination working together. There's been no strong dog
emerge from this group.''
   Her official time was 11 days, 1 hour, 53 minutes and 23
seconds. That is an all-time record, beating by more than 10
minutes her 1987 mark of 11 days, 2 hours and 5 minutes, which was
set on another route.
   The previous record for the northern route _ also set by Butcher
in 1986 _ was 11 days, 15 hours and 6 minutes.
   Butcher said it was extraordinary to break the record on the
slightly longer northern route.
   ``This team had power coming out of its ears,'' she said. ``Not
so much charging up hills, but stamina. It just had it.''
   She wins $50,000 in first-place money plus $25,000 from Purina
Pro Plan, one of her sponsors.
   The rest of the $200,000 purse will be split among the next 19
finishers.
   The record time came as a surprise this year. The 70 mushers who
began the race March 3 had to contend with the deepest snow in a
quarter-century, ash from Redoubt Volcano, some unseasonably warm
days that tired their dogs, buffalo on the trail and marauding
moose.
   Forced to forage in shoulder-deep snow, moose are especially
aggressive this winter. At least two mushers had run-ins with the
huge animals, with tangled their lines and stomped their dogs.
   The only other four-time winner is Rick Swenson, who was leading
out of McGrath near the halfway point. Swenson, of Trapper Creek,
had to turn back and have his team checked by a veterinarian after
one such encounter.
   That cost him the race. Swenson was running in sixth place
Wednesday.
   People emptied out of bars and stores as Butcher headed down
Front Street to cross under the large burl sign that symbolizes the
finish line.
   Nome's populaton of 3,000 roughly doubles during the Iditarod as
the community is host of an amateur basketball tournament involving
53 teams from more than a dozen villages in northern and western
Alaska.
   In addition to her four victories, Butcher has finished second
three times, and among the top 10 four other times.
   The only other woman to win the grueling race, Libby Riddles of
Nome, watched the finish on sunny streets in minus 10-degree
temperatures.
   ``She outraced these guys. She maintained her dog team better,''
Riddles said. ``You make your luck.''
   The Iditarod, named after an old supply route to the gold mining
districts of interior Alaska, draws its inspiration from a 1925
relay of diptheria serum from Nenana to Nome, which was hit hard by
an outbreak of the disease.
   Butcher began 68th of 70 mushers, but moved into the lead just
after the halfway point, and alternated with Runyan and Lavon Barve
of Wasilla as the teams reached the windblown Bering Sea coast near
the end.
   Breaking away from Runyan and Barve, she took the lead for good
Monday in the treacherous night-time crossing of 30 miles of ice
covering Norton Bay.
   Seven teams dropped out, and one team was disqualified.
   The remaining teams were strung out 600 miles back and will be
straggling into Nome for a week or more.

   Tornadoes ground across Texas on Wednesday in a renewed assault
of thunderstorms while crews were still clearing the wreckage of
more than 100 homes left by twisters that ripped six states.
   The thunderstorms also dumped heavy rain that created flood
threats, multiplied in Wisconsin by a dam that burst on a pond
after being battered by ice.
   And while untimely warm weather plagued the Plains and heated
the East, heavy snow made travel hazardous in parts of Wyoming,
North Dakota and Montana.
   Two twisters in central Texas flipped mobile homes, tore off
roofs and toppled utility poles Wednesday, and wind in excess of 50
mph blew over trailers and highway signs and downed power lines
across northern parts of the state. No injuries were reported.
   On Tuesday, tornadoes damaged homes and other property in
Kansas, Illinois, Nebraska, Iowa, Oklahoma and Texas. At least two
people were killed and 29 injured.
   At least 31 cities from the Mississippi Valley eastward reported
record or record-tying high temperatures Wednesday, the third day
of unseasonable warmth. The records included 85 at Baltimore, 75 at
Detroit, 76 at Indianapolis, 80 at Rochester, N.Y., and 86 at
Washington's National Airport. The high at Indianapolis erased a
record on the books since 1875, the National Weather Service said.
   Because of the unseasonable warmth, the cherry blossoms in
Washington will peak Thursday and Friday, and will be gone by the
April opening of the annual Cherry Blossom Festival, said National
Park Service spokeswoman Marja Morris.
   ``Over the weekend they will be good, but they'll only last four
or five days,'' she said. But tulips are about three weeks ahead of
schedule and will flower in time for the cherry blossom festival,
she said.
   In the Dallas area, the weather service posted flash flood
warnings after more than 4 inches of rain fell at Lake Mexia, with
1.50 inches in just one hour, and 2 to 3 inches fell in Henderson
County.
   Missouri also got heavy rain Wednesday as several lines of
thunderstorms swept across the state during the morning.
Springfield had almost 2 inches by 6 a.m., flooding some
intersections and damaging underground telephone cable.
   Flooding also was a major concern in Oklahoma. ``The ground is
completely saturated over much of the state, and flood-prone areas
are going to have a problem,'' meteorologist Ken Huckabee said.
Schools were closed Wednesday in Ochelata and Ramona in
northeastern Oklahoma because of high water.
   Heavy rain flooded rural roads in southwestern Wisconsin and a
dam on a creek that was pounded by floating ice gave way Wednesday,
causing a flood threat downstream on the Trempealeau River at the
city of Arcadia, officials said.
   Police Chief Patrick Grzadzielewski said weather officials
estimated the dam break could produce a rise of 1 to 2 feet in the
river at his city. The river already had been rising about an inch
every hour and was about 12 to 14 inches from the top of its banks
as of 11:30 a.m., he said.
   In colder areas, ground blizzards of fresh snow stirred up by
wind gusting to 50 mph forced the Wyoming Highway Patrol to close a
45-mile stretch of Interstate 80 between Cheyenne and Laramie.
Several jackknifed trucks also contributed to Wedenesday's closure.
   In Montana, the ski area in the Little Belt Mountains southeast
of Great Falls reported 20 inches of new snow Wednesday morning,
but U.S. 89 in the area was snowpacked and icy.
   Schools remained open in snowbound Chouteau County, but the
county spelling bee was canceled because 12 contestants from the
tiny town of Geraldine couldn't make it to Fort Benton.
   Seventy-eight tornadoes were reported Tuesday, 25 in Kansas
alone, said Ed Ferguson, deputy director of the National Severe
Storms Forecast Center in Kansas City. He said he expected the
count to go down because of duplication.
   ``It's very unusual to have that many tornadoes reported any one
day, any time in the season,'' he said.
   Nebraska reported 16 twisters, Iowa had 15, Oklahoma reported
14, Illinois sighted six and two were reported in Texas, he said.
   ``The unusual aspect is that the severe activity extended so far
to the north,'' Ferguson said. ``Normally we expect the severe
weather in northern states to come later in the season.''
   The worst of the tornadoes damaged 75 to 100 homes in Hesston,
Kan., 35 miles north of Wichita, Ferguson said.
   The two deaths occurred near Kansas towns of Burrton and
Goessel, near Hesston.
   ``It looks like it traveled a hundred miles at least and maybe a
little over that. It was on the ground for 2{ hours. The average
tornado is on the ground only for a couple of miles,'' Ferguson
said.
   Extensive damage in Hesston prompted authorities to cordon off
the town of 4,000 on Wednesday, barricading all roads and guarding
heavily damaged residential areas and businesses. A Highway Patrol
officer stood guard outside the Hesston State Bank, which lost its
roof and part of a wall.
   Kansas Gov. Mike Hayden declared eight counties disaster areas.
   Sixteen people were injured in Hesston, but only four required
hospitalization, said City Administrator Jay Weiland, who was in
his home when the tornado approached.
   ``I looked out our back door and I saw this thing coming,'' he
said. ``I thought `Oh, my God, there goes my town.'''

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was the city's bloodiest 24 hours this year: A
mother was gunned down wielding a pitchfork to protect her son from
suspected gang members and a woman was fatally shot at her store
over a jar of Easter Seal coins.
   Six separate shootings and stabbings left three people dead and
four wounded between 1 p.m. Tuesday and 1 p.m. Wednesday, and
pushed Boston's murder rate 50 percent higher than during the same
period last year.
   ``It was a night of violence no city should have to put up
with,'' Police Deputy Superintendent William Celester, who runs the
city's toughest precinct, Area B in Roxbury, said Wednesday.
   ``The next morning, the community lives in fear.''
   The violence erupted during a beautiful, sunny day, a day so
warm it tied a record for the date. It occurred in Roxbury,
Dorchester, Mattapan and Jamaica Plain, Boston's poorest
neighborhoods.
   It left the city with 31 people dead of homicide this year, up
from 21 during the same period last year.
   Police cited at least four other 24-hour periods since 1973 as
having more homicides, but said the latest violence ranked among
the worst in city history.
   The violence began when 57-year-old Jean Strandberg was shot in
the temple at the liquor store in Dorchester where she worked for
more than 20 years. Two robbers fled with a jar of coins collected
for Easter Seals, police said.
   ``She was the nicest person on the face of the Earth,'' said
Jody Gatwinn, a co-worker. ``She was the best friend of a lot of
people.''
   Police arrested Michael Adams, 17, of Boston, on the
second-floor porch of a nearby tenement after the shooting.
Witnesses said he was carrying a shotgun and that a second youth
had been seen fleeing.
   The jar of coins donated to help disabled children was smashed
on a sidewalk, the pennies, nickels and dimes and a few quarters
scattered. Police said the change _ no more than $10 _ was all that
was taken in the robbery.
   Adams pleaded innocent in Dorchester District Court at a tense
hearing during which Judge Darrell Outlaw decried the constant
crime and suggested that the National Guard may eventually need to
come in to quell the violence.
   ``Something drastic has to take place,'' Outlaw said. ``These
are unusual times and they call for unusual measures.''
   Around 8:30 p.m. Tuesday, Delores Newberry, 33, a mother of
five, was shot in the chest as she chased at least two youths who
were apparently trying to set fire to her Roxbury apartment. Police
said she picked up a pitchfork to protect her son before being
fatally shot.
   Newberry's family has been nearly decimated by street violence.
Her husband was shot in the heart at a housing project last summer.
Newberry's sister was shot to death by her boyfriend on a street in
1987.
   About 90 minutes before Newberry's slaying, 30-year-old Carl
Benbow was found shot in the head near a Roxbury housing project
and taken to Brigham and Women's Hospital, where he was pronounced
dead, police said. The Boston Globe reported that a man who said he
was Benbow's brother and identified himself only as the
``Terminator'' promised revenge.
   ``They just erupted guerrilla warfare,'' the brother was quoted
as saying. ``You are going to have to take me in for a homicide.''
   Police Commissioner Francis M. Roache, Mayor Raymond Flynn and
Celester all echoed a similar refrain when calling for a halt to
the violence: tighter gun control.
   ``We've got to get the illegal guns out of the hands of drug
runners,'' Flynn said when he arrived at the scene of Benbow's
slaying Tuesday night.
   Two 19-year-olds, Ernesto Morrison and Nathaniel Chaney, both of
Dorchester, were in stable condition at Boston City Hospital on
Tuesday night, following a shooting about 7 p.m. in Mattapan. A
hospital spokesman said Morrison was shot in the back and Chaney
was shot in leg.
   A 31-year-old man was shot Tuesday night as he stood on a
Dorchester street. Stanley Kelly was listed in stable condition at
Boston City Hospital with at least two gunshot wounds.
   Police have not arrested any suspects and do not have a motive
in those shootings.
   A Roxbury woman, Aishah Jamaal, 27, also was arrested Tuesday on
charges of stabbing another woman in the face during a fight in the
city's red light district, the Combat Zone.

<DATELINE>HESSTON, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Central Kansas residents were confronted by
rubble piles that once were their homes Wednesday in the wake of a
slow-moving tornado that killed two people.
   ``It came right across the trees that are splintered over
there,'' said Lowell Good, whose home was one of the first hit
Tuesday evening in Hesston, which suffered the heaviest damage.
``It sounded like a big grinder grinding things up.''
   Barricades blocked entry to the town after Gov. Mike Hayden sent
National Guard troops to discourage sightseeing and looting. The
governor also declared eight central Kansas counties disaster areas.
   Sixteen Hesston residents were injured, but only four required
hospitalization. Several others were reported injured in other
areas. None of the injuries were thought to be life-threatening.
The two fatalities were near the towns of Burrton and Goessel.
   At least 75 houses in Hesston were damageed and an estimated two
dozen were destroyed. About 15 business were damaged and five of
those were demolished. Officials had not estimated the damage in
dollars.
   Twisted piles of metal, wood and insulation marked where
businesses once stood. Street light poles tilted at 45-degree
angles and street signs were flattened to the ground by wind
estimated at 100 mph or more.
   About 20 farms were destroyed outside town.
   Among them was the Eli Bontrager farmstead near Burrton.
   ``If I had listened to my wife, that's where we'd be,'' he said
pointing to the basement of what used to be his 90-year-old
farmhouse.
   A large trailer used to store chain saws and other equipment was
upended in the basement. Its tires had blown off.
   Bontrager, 76, and his wife, Opal, 75, escaped harm by driving
nearly a mile away from their home as the storm approached.
   Thirty-year-old cottonwood and cedar trees that had once nearly
obscured the Bontrager place from view were stripped of their
limbs, chopped down to 18-foot stumps in 30 seconds.
   ``I don't know if we're going to try to rebuild or just take our
insurance money and move into town,'' Bontrager said.
   Ed Ferguson, deputy director of the National Severe Storms
Forecast Center in Kansas City, Mo., said the Hesston tornado was
one of 25 reported across Kansas in slightly more than 24 hours.
   More than 300 utility poles were knocked down by Tuesday night's
storms leaving more than 4,000 customers without electricity. By
daybreak, about 13 hours after the late afternoon tornado struck,
electrical power had been restored to several areas of Hesston.
Kansas Gas and Electric Co. had more than 300 workers making
repairs.
   In Sumner County, in south-central Kansas along the Oklahoma
line, at least seven farms were damaged by a tornado the width of
two football fields that stayed on the ground for more than 20
miles.

   Tornadoes gobbled up farmhouses as they veered through the
Plains on the second day of a winter heat wave that brought
strollers to parks and sidewalk cafes in the East and Midwest.
   The funnel clouds plowed through Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa,
Oklahoma and Texas on Tuesday, killing two people, injuring at
least 22 and wrecking scores of houses.
   One tornado ripped a 100-mile path in a 2{-hour tear through
southeastern Kansas. It lingered in Hesston, Kan., a town of 3,000
people, long enough to damage 75 to 100 houses. A 6-year-old boy
died and a mother and her teen-age son were missing today.
   Thunderstorms brought flood warnings early today to Oklahoma,
Iowa, Wisconsin and Illinois. Walnut-sized hail fell at Groom,
Texas.

   Millionaire oilman-rancher Clayton Williams
got everything he hoped for _ the Republican nomination for
governor and the prospect of a bruising Democratic runoff between
Treasurer Ann Richards and Attorney General Jim Mattox.
   ``In the words of that world-famous philosopher Jackie Gleason,
`How sweet it is,''' Williams told a hotel ballroom full of
whooping supporters after humbling all comers in Tuesday's GOP
primary with 61 percent of the vote.
   With 94 percent of precincts counted, the West Texas businessman
got 490,018 votes. Railroad Commissioner Kent Hance, a former
Democratic congressman, was a distant second with 124,255 votes, or
15 percent. Farther back were lawyer Tom Luce and former Secretary
of State Jack Rains.
   Ms. Richards and Mattox ran neck-and-neck in the brutal
Democratic race, sinking the comeback hopes of former Gov. Mark
White. With 93 percent of precincts reporting, Ms. Richards had
532,746 votes, or 40 percent, to Mattox's 495,833, or 37 percent.
White received 259,504, or 19 percent.

   The United States, yielding to the concerns of
Western European allies, will propose a plan this week to reduce
troops and non-nuclear weapons in Europe with a key monitoring
provision deleted, a senior Bush administration official says.
   The abandoned provision called for stationing monitors at
European ports and weapons factories to guard against violations of
the 23-nation treaty nearing completion in Vienna.
   But the official, who outlined the verification package on
condition of anonymity, said virtually all the allies objected
strenuously to Soviet monitors at their plants and ports.
   The revised Western proposal will be presented in Vienna as
negotiators for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the
Warsaw Pact hold their sixth round of talks on a treaty designed
for signing this year.

medical examiner. Smialek declined to give details. Friends said
Bettelheim recently had suffered a stroke.
   A survivor of the Nazi death camps, Bettelheim came to the
United States during World War II and became a pioneer in treating

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Cops'' producer Paul Stojanovich was out of
breath as he whispered the cryptic instructions.
   ``We're about to do a drug bust,'' he told a reporter. ``I'll
meet you at the Peter Pan Motel, Room 38.''
   Minutes later, in a seedy area bathed by the neon glare of the
downtown area's Glitter Gulch, Las Vegas Metro Police burst into
Room 38. A startled drug seller and his customers found themselves
under arrest _ and the subjects of the ``Cops'' film crew.
   ``Cops'' is a new genre of cop show: live-on-tape action,
courtesy of the culprits. Boy, wouldn't Joe Friday have been
jealous.
   The half-hour series is leading Fox Broadcasting's Saturday
night lineup, averaging a 7.0 Nielsen rating and a 13 percent share
of the viewers in its time period, according to the network's
audience estimates.
   It still lags well behind its competition _ which currently
consists of ABC's new ``H.E.L.P.,'' NBC's ``ALF'' and CBS'
``Paradise'' _ but Fox ratings tend to be lower because the network
has fewer stations carrying its programs, a total of 130, compared
to more than 200 stations for each major network.
   The evolution of ``Cops'' dates to 1981, when Stojanovich tailed
a narcotics unit to produce a show called ``Cocaine Blues.''
   He approached the networks with the ``Cops'' idea two years ago,
and Fox bought the concept, airing the first episode in January
1989.
   ``Cops'' since has visited a host of cities, including Miami,
Portland, Ore., New Orleans, San Diego and Los Angeles, and
recently filmed a series of shows in the Soviet Union.
   Police departments across the country kept suggesting Las Vegas
_ the neighbor of North Las Vegas, the locale of NBC's new ``Nasty
Boys'' police series _ so Stojanovich and company came here in
January for two weeks of filming.
   The results of their visit will air as a one-hour ``Cops''
special April 7.
   The officers bursting through the Vegas motel room door found a
gun on the premises, but no shots were fired. The ``Cops'' camera
crew, wearing bullet-proof vests, was right behind as officers
broke into the room.
   ``Most of our guys have done combat or heavy news,'' Stojanovich
said of the crew members. ``These guys are good.''
   Across the nation, the crews have put on film a wide spectrum of
an officer's tour of duty, from domestic disputes to drug deals,
car chases to homicide investigations.
   Stojanovich said he's found himself in some touchy situations
since taking on ``Cops.''
   ``We were shooting a multikilo drug bust in Florida with the DEA
when things got out of control,'' he recalled. ``It took 10
officers to take this one guy down, and I'm caught in the middle.
Suddenly, I find myself standing next to one of the suspects and
the other officers were involved with trying to control the one
guy. I just stared at the other suspect. I hoped he thought I was a
cop or something.''
   The worst injury to a crew member so far was an ankle broken in
a foot pursuit in Miami, Stojanovich said.
   While shooting in Las Vegas, the ``Cops'' crew went along on a
call from a battered wife and had to watch as two young children
screamed while their feuding parents were taken away.
   ``That can be really upsetting,'' Stojanovich said.
   On another night, the crew happened on a car accident. As they
were filming, the traffic officer on the scene was run down and
badly injured by a drunken driver in a pickup truck.
   ``You never know what the next call is going to turn into,''
Stojanovich said.
   The message of the show?
   ``We try to show that so many cop shows are unrealistic, the
guys are glorified, they're heroes. In reality, police work is
often very tedious,'' he said. ``We hope to educate the public on
what the police are up against. We try to make some sanity out of
the insanity.''
   Homicides are some of the toughest crimes to film _ and to work,
Stojanovich said.
   ``Most people don't realize how grim it is until they see it
from a cop's perspective,'' he said. ``The detectives have to make
some sense out of it. It explodes the myth of `Colombo' _ you don't
always get the guy. Cops don't have screenwriters to write their
scenario, their finish.''

   Lawmakers, governor's aides, lobbyists and
government workers gather once a week in the room used as the
state's nerve center during Hurricane Hugo for an activity they say
goes beyond politics and eases Statehouse stress.
   Instead of discussing an upcoming bill, they reviewed a passage
from Matthew during a recent Bible study session in the governor's
conference room in the Capitol.
   The 20 participants who came to the 7:30 a.m. meeting on a
drizzling Wednesday put aside any political differences for 45
minutes and left with a sense of spiritual fulfillment.
   ``God is not a politician. This is fellowship,'' said Elliott D.
Thompson, former chairman of the Alcoholic Beverage and Control
Commission who is now a lawyer and lobbyist.
   For the past three years, Gov. Carroll Campbell's deputy chief
of staff, Bob McAlister, has organized the informal Bible study
sessions. Campbell, a Republican, does not attend but several
Democratic lawmakers do.
   ``I think it indicates that there are more important things in
life than politics, and that the pre-eminant question of life is
spiritual,'' McAlister said.
   Participants bring their well-worn Bibles, grab a cup of coffee
in the governor's office and sit around the large wooden table
usually host to Budget and Control Board meetings. The room also is
used by Campbell for news conferences and served as one of his
command posts during Hugo in September.
   Sen. Yancey McGill, D-Kingstree, joined at the start of the
legislation session in January and said he has grown close to the
others in the group.
   Lawmakers ``have a lot of pressure on us from day to day, not
only here in Columbia but in the district at home,'' McGill said.
``I think the study of God's word is the most important thing to me
and it certainly strengthens and really assists me in making
decisions on a daily basis.''
   McGill said he feels ``total relaxation'' during the gatherings.
   Rep. David Beasley, D-Society Hill, said ``an inconsequential
benefit'' from the meetings is a better look at how the governor's
office works.
   Beasley said he has learned more about some of Campbell's staff
through Bible study.
   ``The only people who go ... are pretty committed to Christian
causes, Christian ethics ... and that tells you a lot right there
about someone,'' Beasley said. ``If they're in that posture,
they're more apt to do what's right. Then it opens up an automatic
friendship and we can just sit down and discuss things because
there's automatically a mutal respect.''
   The Rev. Donald L. Burnett, pastor at St. Andrews Evangelical
Church, moderates.
   ``There are many issues we disagree on but we can agree on
essential things,'' he said.
   McAlister, however, is the driving force behind the Bible study,
which began three years ago with three others as the original
members.
   McAlister's religious beliefs earned public attention in the
days before the scheduled execution of inmate Rusty Woomer in 1989.
McAlister, who has ministered to inmates over the past five years,
befriended Woomer as a result of visits to death row to share
Christian fellowship.
   Campbell rejected Woomer's appeal for clemency but the U.S.
Supreme Court has delayed the execution.
   Campbell knows about the Bible study meetings but has chosen not
to attend, McAlister said.
   ``I've never asked him to because the dynamics of the group
would change,'' McAlister said. ``I think he and I talked about it
and his presence'' might mean ``you'd have others coming for the

<HEAD>Oil Conservation No Longer High on the Transportation Agenda</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tucked away near the end of the
administration's 129-page transportation policy is a brief and
general pledge to work for oil conservation _ a faint echo of the
energy crisis that dominated the national agenda not so long ago.
   In the era of the oil embargo, of gasoline lines and rocketing
prices that spiraled inflation, energy was a major problem for two
presidents and a dominant political issue during much of the 1970s.
Now it is back-of-the-book stuff despite increasing U.S. dependence
on imported oil.
   Imports, an embargo and a cut in foreign oil supplies were
components of the energy crises that confronted Richard M. Nixon
and beset Jimmy Carter. They advocated policies to make sure it
couldn't happen again.
   But it could.
   Oil imports in January were the highest in 12 years. Imports
have been rising, domestic oil production falling. Prices are down,
which makes foreign oil less expensive than the alternatives. But
it certainly isn't inexpensive. Oil imports account for about $50
billion of the persistent U.S. trade deficit.
   According to the American Petroleum Institute, imported oil
accounted for 54 percent of U.S. consumption in January, a record
high. CIA Director William Webster has told Congress that reliance
on Persian Gulf oil is likely to increase markedly over the next
several years.
   Nixon launched Project Independence, seeking to end U.S.
dependence on foreign energy sources after the Arab oil embargo. It
didn't happen. Carter said in 1977 the nation should declare the
moral equivalent of war to master its energy problems. Carter later
was taunted with his program's acronym: MEOW. Parts of his program
were shelved; as some others expired they were not renewed.
   The crises eased, foreign oil became plentiful and relatively
cheap, and Ronald Reagan's administration pushed the whole issue
far down the agenda, slashing the energy conservation budget and
proposing, unsuccessfully, that Congress eliminate the Department
of Energy.
   Now Bush's Department of Energy is at work on a new national
energy strategy, with the initial version due next month and the
final report before the end of the year.
   It will have to be a companion piece to the transportation
policy statement, which observes:
   ``Transportation accounts for more than a quarter of total
national energy consumption and close to two-thirds of the
petroleum used in the United States each year.''
   It goes on to say that conservation and more efficient motor
vehicles have led to significant energy savings in the past two
decades, and that there is more to come.
   The transportation policy pledges ``to foster development and
use of more fuel-efficient vehicles and transportation
operations.'' There are no specific recommendations on the
politically and economically sensitive issue of future fuel economy
standards to be required of U.S. automobile manufacturers.
   The requirements were relaxed during Reagan's second term;
Secretary of Transportation Samuel K. Skinner reinstated them for
the 1990 model year, requiring that cars produced by each U.S.
manufacturer get an average 27.5 miles per gallon of gas. Congress
may act later this year on amendments to the fuel economy rules set
after the 1973-1974 Arab oil embargo.
   Noting that some forms of travel are more energy-efficient than
others in meeting the same needs, the transportation policy says
that mass transit and inter city rail service can serve as
fuel-saving alternatives to the private automobile in heavily
populated areas.
   It also proposes to end operating subsidies and reduce other
federal spending for mass transit and rail passenger service, so
that passengers, cities and states will pick up the cost.
   The theory is that those are local and regional, not national
facilities, and so should be paid for locally and regionally. That
may not mesh with a transportation strategy in which conserving oil
is a national aim.
   But then, there's no crisis now.

<HEAD>Outrage Over Spills Spurs Crackdown On Oil Industry</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The safety measures set up in Prince
William Sound since the wreck of the Exxon Valdez are impressive:
oil skimmers lie waiting in remote bays, and powerful tugs trail
every tanker leaving port.
   The hostile glare of publicity forced the improvements in
Alaska, but critics say the oil industry has a long way to go
toward preventing and cleaning up spills elsewhere in the nation.
   ``What oil companies do best is discover, produce, ship and
market oil. Cleaning spills is not their bag,'' said Walt Parker,
chairman of an Alaska state task force that studied the Valdez
spill. ``They'll do as much as they have to, and no more.''
   The U.S. House has passed a bill that would allow states to
adopt stricter spill liability laws than the federal government and
require double hulls on all tankers in U.S. waters.
   A conference committee now is trying to reconcile differences
with a weaker Senate bill, which calls for more study on double
hulls and leaves the final decision up to the secretary of
transportation.
   Legislatures in nearly every seaboard state are considering
proposals to increase tanker and oil barge safety or improve spill
cleanup capabilities.
   ``Large spills are something we face in all our port areas,''
said Sarah Chasis, attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, a New York-based environmental group. ``There will always
be a certain number of oil spills, but many measures can be taken
to reduce their likelihood.''
   Oil companies hoped to head off some of the legislative furor
last June by announcing a $250 million, five-year plan to create a
nationwide network of spill-response teams, but it has stalled as
the companies watch what action Congress and the states take.
   The public outrage over the Exxon Valdez accident last March 24
has been kept alive by a string of messy fuel spills around the
country.
   In the past year, at least 81 spills of more than 5,000 gallons
occurred in the United States, said spill expert Richard Golob of
Cambridge, Mass.
   The most significant ones, according to his newsletter, Golob's
Oil Pollution Bulletin:
   _June 23: The Greek tanker World Prodigy hit a reef off Rhode
Island, spilling 420,000 gallons of heating oil. The same day, a
barge collided with a tanker in Texas, spilling 252,000 gallons of
slurry oil into the Houston Ship Channel. The next day, a Uruguayan
tanker ran aground in the Delaware River, spilling 300,000 gallons
of fuel oil.
   _Jan. 1: An underwater pipeline running from an Exxon refinery
ruptured, spilling 567,000 gallons of heating oil into Arthur Kill,
a busy industrial waterway between New Jersey and New York's Staten
Island.
   _Feb. 7: The American Trader, chartered by British Petroleum,
was gored by its own anchor and spilled nearly 400,000 gallons of
Alaskan crude oil off Huntington Beach in Southern California.
   _Feb. 28-March 6: Three accidents within a week leaked a total
of 160,000 gallons of crude, fuel and heating oil into New Jersey's
Arthur Kill and adjoining Kill Van Kull.
   Except for the massive Exxon Valdez spill, which totaled about
10.8 million gallons, the accidents were business as usual for the
oil transportation industry, Golob said.
   ``Professionals in the oil-pollution field know that oil spills
take place on a regular basis,'' he said. ``The main difference
this year is the extensive media coverage of oil spills. In 1988, a
spill of 1 million gallons might have occupied a one-inch story in
the New York Times. In 1989, a spill that large would have taken
over half the page.''
   As oil from the American Trader washed up on Southern California
beaches, stores sold T-shirts proclaiming ``Crude Is Rude, Dude,''
and campaigning politicians held so many shoreside press
conferences that the mayor of Huntington Beach asked for advance
notice so they wouldn't interfere with cleanup efforts.
   An oil-spill measure previously given little chance of passage
was put on the fast track in the California Assembly. It would
tighten control of tanker traffic and create a $500 million cleanup
fund from a 50-cent-a-barrel tax on crude oil brought into the
state.
   Other states considering strengthened controls include
Louisiana, where state wildlife officials want double hulls on all
tankers using state waters, and Rhode Island, where a bill
introduced with the state attorney general's blessing would make
oil shippers assume unlimited liability for damages caused by
spills, even if no negligence is proved.
   Environmentalists are cheered by the explosion of legislative
action _ especially the U.S. House proposal for double-hulled
tankers, a requirement repeatedly defeated by the oil industry for
nearly 20 years.
   The oil industry argues that double hulls could make ships more
unstable in major accidents, and says the cost of building new
tankers or retrofitting old ones would be high. Only 10 percent of
the world's fleet of 3,200 large tankers have double hulls or
double bottoms, said American Petroleum Institute spokesman Bill
Taylor.
   But Chasis, the attorney for the environmental group, said
studies have shown double hulls or bottoms would prevent or greatly
limit most spills.
   ``The cost of one major oil spill like the Exxon Valdez _ which
is $2 billion and mounting _ could pay for the increased cost of
building 100 or more tankers with double hulls,'' she said.

<HEAD>If Broker Goes Under, Investors Are Protected</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marilyn Helding, 65-year-old widow of a
Wisconsin vegetable farmer, thought the money from her husband's
estate vanished like crops in the Dust Bowl when Windsor Capital
Corp. went out of business.
   ``I nearly went crazy when they went under,'' Mrs. Helding said
from her home in Franksville, Wis. ``I didn't know what to do.''
   A few months after the small Milwaukee brokerage collapsed under
apparent mismanagement in March 1988, Mrs. Helding regained her
entire stock portfolio and $45,000 in cash the firm owed her.
   The message: If your broker goes bust your investment doesn't
have to.
   With the recent collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., two
other brokerage bankruptcy court filings in the last year and
widely publicized problems at several Wall Street firms, the safety
of customer accounts is drawing attention.
   An agency established by Congress after a rash of brokerage
house failures in the late 1960s protects investors who may have
thought their account went down the drain with the company that
managed it.
   The Securities Investor Protection Corp. has a $485 million fund
that insures individual accounts for up to $500,000, including up
to $100,000 in cash. Large brokerages also have insurance for
larger amounts.
   Tapping into the protection fund is a last resort. If a
brokerage firm goes belly up, SIPC first tries to arrange a
transfer of customer accounts to another firm.
   ``The basic intention is that a customer should not lose assets
or property because the broker with whom (he is) doing business has
encountered financial difficulty,'' said Theodore H. Focht, SIPC's
president and general counsel.
   SIPC _ pronounced sippick _ covers all forms of stock and bond
holdings but not commodities. It also does not guarantee the
underlying value of a customer account. For example, if XYZ Co. is
trading at $50 a share when a brokerage folds but falls to $5 at
reimbursement time, the customer loses the difference.
   ``It does not insure you for market losses,'' said Irving
Picard, a New York bankruptcy lawyer who has served as a
court-appointed SIPC trustee in three liquidation cases. ``If you
think the broker defrauded you ... that's not protected by the SIPC
fund.''
   In the 19 years since its creation, SIPC has handled 212 cases
and paid $185 million to satisfy customer claims. If a firm can't
immediately pay, SIPC will advance the money to customers and try
to collect later.
   SIPC officials estimate that cash and securities worth $1.4
billion have been returned to about 240,000 investors, mostly
through account transfers. A total of 305 claims worth $31 million
have not been satisfied, primarily because of legal challenges.
   The SIPC fund, comparable to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
for commercial banks, is fed by required contributions from the
nation's 12,000 or so registered broker-dealers.
   The Washington-based agency also has $500 million in bank credit
and a $1 billion line to the U.S. Treasury. Neither resource has
been tapped. On top of that, about 25 firms have private coverage
of up to $5 million per account.
   Before SIPC was signed into law by President Nixon on Dec. 30,
1970, self-regulatory organizations _ the National Association of
Securities Dealers and the stock exchanges _ set aside funds to
protect customers of collapsed firms.
   But in the late 1960s, Wall Street was hit with a rash of
failures when the market slumped as firms spent large sums to
computerize. When its customer protection kitty dried up, the New
York Stock Exchange was forced to dip into a building fund to
safeguard investors. Fearing the worst, the exchanges lobbied
Congress for help.
   There were six SIPC cases last year _ five involved a total of
under 50 claims. The most cases in one year was 40 in 1972, during
a recession. A rash of financial fraud was partly responsible for
46 cases from 1981-85.
   SIPC's largest payout, $32.5 million, involved the 1983 criminal
fraud-related collapse of Bell &amp; Beckwith of Toledo, Ohio. The
demise of Fitzgerald, DeArman &amp; Roberts Inc. of Tulsa, Okla.,
involved the most customer accounts, 50,000. SIPC has doled out
$5.5 million since that case began in June 1988.
   SIPC can get involved when a broker-dealer enters bankruptcy
court proceedings, when a trustee or receiver is appointed to run a
firm, when a firm fails to meet federal requirements or when it
can't demonstrate compliance.
   A brokerage can request a SIPC-run liquidation or SIPC can ask
the Securities and Exchange Commission to seek a court order for
one.
   Drexel, for example, was not placed in a SIPC proceeding because
only its parent company filed for federal bankruptcy court
protection and the firm is liquidating orderly. Plus, Drexel sold
most retail accounts to Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. last year
and the rest went to Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. after the
bankruptcy filing.

<HEAD>Letters to Sartre Tarnish French Feminist's Image</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two volumes of letters from Simone de Beauvoir to
her lifetime companion, Jean-Paul Sartre, provide graphic details
on the famous couple's private life, and critics say the French
feminist philosopher emerges as predatory, opportunistic and macho.
   ``Lettres a Sartre'' (``Letters to Sartre''), published in
February by Gallimard along with de Beauvoir's ``Journal de
Guerre'' (``War Journal''), recount in the most minute detail the
daily routine of the author of ``The Second Sex,'' the bible of
feminists around the world.
   The letters are responses to Sartre's own letters to de
Beauvoir, which were published in 1983 as ``Lettres au Castor,''
the title Sartre's favorite term of endearment for de Beauvoir _
beaver.
   Her correspondence was thought to have been lost until the
couple's adopted daughter, Sylvie Le Bon de Beauvoir, found the
letters by chance in a closet, still wrapped in their original
envelopes addressed to ``Monsieur Sartre'' or ``Soldier Sartre.''
   Some French critics wish the letters had stayed in the closet.
   ``This asphyxiating outpouring is a crime against the Castor,''
wrote Marianne Alphant in the daily Liberation.
   ``What do the letters teach us?'' she asks. ``That the pioneer
of feminism only liked women she could dominate? That this austere
muse was as moody and jealous as a simple housewife? That the
novelist so thrilled with her `little inventions' was only a master
recycler?''
   The letters also prove, Alphant wrote, that de Beauvoir's
successful autobiography, ``La Force d'Age,'' was rigged and full
of falsifications.
   Other critics were less harsh. Josyane Savigneau of Le Monde
argued that the letters show how the couple respected the
``contract of transparency'' _ complete honesty at all costs _
which became their credo in 1929 and endured until Sartre's death
in 1980.
   In the letters, de Beauvoir details her love affairs with a male
student of Sartre's and with some of her own women students,
including Louise Vedrine and Nathalie Sorokine.
   Hoping to ``add a little spice'' to Sartre's dull life as a
German prisoner of war in 1939-40, she provides graphic _ and
sometimes sordid details _ about what her lovers wore, what they
said, how they behaved in bed, and even how they smelled.
   ``In bed, Vedrine throws herself passionately in my arms, these
sensual swoonings seem so terribly organic,'' de Beauvoir wrote.
``When I wake up, I feel like a fat, sated man because I avoid
caresses, I think only about breakfast and about my work.''
   De Beauvoir wrote that sex was a chore, yet she was fascinated
with brothels, prostitutes and other forms of low life that her
buttoned-up bourgeois upbringing had made taboo.
   At times, she comes across as downright conniving. ``If Wanda
says anything about me, be sure to tell me so I can know if my
charm offensive is working,'' she wrote.
   For Alphant, de Beauvoir's behavior towards women was ``predator
and macho ... linked to an ambiguous desire to play the role of the
man.''
   But she was equally aggressive with men. ``Something extremely
pleasant has happened to me, something I never expected _ I slept
with the little Bost three days ago _ naturally I was the one to
suggest it,'' she wrote to Sartre in 1938. Bost's first name was
not given.
   ``I'm very fond of him. We spend idyllic days and passionate
nights together ... (the relationship) is something precious, and
strong, but superficial, too, and easy, just an agreeable
fulfillment of relations that had always been pleasant.''
   Nonetheless, the overriding theme in the letters is de
Beauvoir's undying love and respect for Sartre. She addresses him
as ``my dear little being,'' and she loves everything about him,
from his ``little arm'' and ``little lip,'' to his ``little
round-neck pullover sweaters'' and ``little face.''
   ``When I'm with you, nothing seems so terrible as leaving you,
yet faraway, the least little fear is unbearable. I love you
passionately. I'm empty and unhappy without you. ... I love you
with something tragic and with complete abandonment,'' she wrote.
   Le Bon de Beauvoir justified publishing the letters. She said
the whole truth _ regardless of how shocking or unsettling _ is
better than myths and part truths.
   ``Isn't it preferable to say everything in order to reveal the
truth. And avoid, by the force of first person narrative, all the
cliches, myths, lies, and allow the real person in, all its
entirety to emerge,'' Le Bon de Beauvoir wrote in the preface.
   Readers may be surprised to learn how little de Beauvoir worried
about or even thought about World War II. She was too busy rushing
from one Left Bank cafe to another, meeting friends and lovers,
analyzing their relationships and writing it all in letters to
Sartre _ all in the name of honesty.
   ``From a distance, this was a grand task,'' Alphant concluded.
``Up close, it looks more like a hamster running on a wheel.''

   The Rev. Thomas J. McAnoy wept when he saw what
vandals did to his church.
   Broken stained glass lay in puddled foam that had been sprayed
about the sanctuary from a fire extinguisher. Banners were torn
from their posts, liturgical vestments splashed with wine and
tossed in an alley.
   That desecration last September and other troubles threatened
the life of Our Lady of Rosary Church in downtown Detroit. But
while many inner-city Roman Catholic parishes here and elsehwere
have closed, the century-old Rosary is making it.
   The battering from vandals occurred only three weeks before the
church marked its 100th anniversary and while its continued
existence was considered uncertain by the Detroit archdiocese.
   Rosary was among 24 inner-city churches whose futures were
labeled questionable in the second stage of the largest Catholic
church retrenchment in U.S. history. Thirty other parishes had been
closed earlier during phase one in early 1989.
   Similar difficulties strained other urban parishes. Chicago's
big debt-burdened archdiocese said in January that 30 financially
strapped parishes with declining congregations and at least six
schools would be closed.
   The possibility of that fate hung over Rosary, a red sandstone
building that rises grandly above Interstate 94. The vandalism
worsened the anxieties; parishoners feared the $8,000 repair bill
would be the final blow.
   Rosary already was struggling with other hardships: the loss of
an organist who moved away, the pastor's failing health. McAnoy,
60, had recently lost his second leg to amputation because of poor
circulation.
   But when the verdict came in February on the archdiocese's phase
two, only five more parishes were closed, bringing the total in
Detroit to 35 in a year. Cardinal Edmund Szoka said Rosary would
stay open.
   Parishoners said the past year would be remembered as ``the year
of the milestone,'' not the tombstone.
   ``I think we are more focused now,'' said Norbert Kidd,
president of the parish council. ``I think a lot of people sat down
and said, `This church, the people in it, the family that gathers
here, we mean something to each other.'''
   The closings of other parishes, blamed on dwindling resources
caused by three decades of Catholics migrating to the suburbs,
brought angry protests from some parishioners.
   ``It did serve as a heck of a motivator,'' said Jay Berman,
spokesman for the archdiocese. ``It woke a lot of people up where
things were in the doldrums.''
   In 1989, Rosary, with its self-assigned mission of reaching out
to mentally and physically disabled people in the neighborhood,
increased its membership from 477 to about 560. Kidd said he
expects the number to grow to 600.
   Rosary also nearly tripled its weekly collection, bringing it
into compliance with the archdiocese's directive that $50,000 of
the church's $100,000 annual budget come from donations. Kidd said
he told parishioners $961 had to be collected each week.
   ``Since July there have been only two weekends we fell below
that,'' he said. ``It used to be if we broke $300, we were
congratulating ourselves.''
   Some of Rosary's new members came from St. Theresa's, a church
about 10 miles from Rosary that was closed under Szoka's order.
   One transplant, Idell Lee of Detroit, said the transition was
difficult because ``St. Theresa's was home and there was no other
place to turn.''
   Lee said on her first visit she looked inside Our Lady of the
Rosary, which has neither pews nor elaborate paintings on the
walls, and thought, ``This is it?''
   Then one of the blind parishioners tugged at her dress and asked
her if she would bring him a cup of coffee. ``I knew then I was in
the right place,'' Lee said.
   The church, which is about 60 percent white, 25 percent black
and 15 percent Asian, also proved its viability by certifying its
speakers and eucharistic ministers through the archdiocese.
   It also increased evangelical services and received an
acceptable, though critical, report from two people who paid an
unannounced visit on behalf of the archdiocese.
   Their report recommended the church use more approved texts,
train lay ministers on the meaning of liturgical symbols and
gestures and re-evaluate the practice of allowing parishioners to
dip communion hosts into the wine, which is supposed to be sipped.
   Overall, Kidd thought the report was fair.
   ``It's like they wanted us to hear the lecture and once we heard
the lecture it was OK, just so that we knew what should be,'' he
said.

   Three people are seeking top offices in
the Southern Baptist Convention to try to steer the 14.8
million-member denomination away from its fundamentalist path of
the past 11 years.
   Steve Tondera, a layman and senior engineer at Marshall Space
Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., last week announced his
candidacy for a vice presidency on a moderate slate at the
denomination's convention in June.
   Also running as moderates are the Rev. Daniel Vestal of
Dunwoody, Ga., seeking the presidency, and Carolyn Weatherford
Crumpler, former head of the Women's Missionary Union, running for
another vice presidency.
   Together, they seek to unseat a fundamentalist administration
that came into power in 1979 and began appointing others with
similar views to key posts on the boards of Baptist colleges and
agencies.
   The fundamentalist wing, which this time is backing the Rev.
Norris Chapman of Wichita Falls, Texas, for the presidency, gained
control under the banner of biblical literalism.

   A study monitoring television preachers
finds that on the average they devote about a fourth of their time
to fund-raising and promotion.
   But major shifts in that area have occurred in some TV
ministries.
   The study made by Stephen Winzenburg, communications professor
at Grand View College, found that both Pat Robertson and Oral
Roberts had sharply increased time used seeking support.
   Roberts now uses 53 percent of his air time in fund-raising and
promotion, compared to 22 percent in 1987, while Robertson spends
44 percent of his programs asking financial help, up from 22
percent three years ago, the report said.
   However, the Rev. Jerry Falwell has reduced fund-raising appeals
in that period from 52 percent to 37 percent, it said.
   Winzenburg said the decline in viewership that saw audiences for
syndicated religious programs fall 30 percent in the 1987-89 period
after the Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart sex scandals appeared to
have leveled off.

   COURSEULLES-SUR-MER, France (AP) _ Eight days after Allied
soldiers stormed ashore in Normandy, the destroyer La Combattante
carried Gen. Charles de Gaulle across the choppy, gray English
Channel to a beach at Courseulles-sur-Mer.
   Or was it next door at Graye-sur-Mer?
   Forty-six years later, the communities still argue over whose
sand bore the imprint June 14, 1944, of the general's first
footprint of the liberation.
   The dispute has regained the stature of controversy in this
special year of de Gaulle _ the 100th anniversary of his birth, the
20th anniversary of his death and the 50th anniversary of his
``appeal of June 18'' from London in 1940, urging the French to
resist the German occupation.
   A veterans' group, the Normandy Landing Committee, decided to
commemorate the year by erecting a 60-foot-high metal cross of
Lorraine. De Gaulle took the double-barred cross as his personal
symbol and it remains the symbol of Gaullism.
   For what the committee members called ``aesthetic reasons,''
they decided to install the cross on Graye's beach, which enraged
the folks at the Courseulles city hall.
   De Gaulle's own war memoirs are not much help.
   ``On the morning of June 14, we cast anchor as near as possible
to the French coast and landed together with a Canadian regiment on
the beach between the communities of Courseulles and
Sainte-Mere-Eglise,'' he wrote. Courseulles and Sainte-Mere-Eglise
are about 45 miles apart.
   Canadian soldiers liberated Courseulles-sur-Mer and
Graye-sur-Mer on D-Day _ June 6, 1944. At one time or another, de
Gaulle told officials of both towns he had fond memories of landing
on their beach after four years in London.
   ``I'm sure de Gaulle himself did not know exactly where he set
foot,'' said Remy Simon, a councilman assigned by Courseulles Mayor
Jean-Louis de Mourgues to gather documents and build the case for
their town, which has about 3,000 inhabitants.
   ``In the end, all this business is very painful,'' said Mayor
Michel Grimaux of Graye, whose population is about 600. He hinted
that Courseulles' interest was commercial as much as historic.
   Adding to the problem is the fact that no one in either town saw
the general arrive. For security reasons, only military commanders
were told in advance.
   Later on June 14, after giving a speech at Bayeux, de Gaulle
returned to Courseulles and reboarded the destroyer. There is no
shortage of photographs of his departure from Courseulles.
   ``In 1946, de Gaulle came back, and he came back to
Courseulles,'' said Simon, who has a foot-thick file of documents
on the matter. ``All of the eyewitnesses of the time confirm it was
Courseulles.''
   The Courseulles documentation includes letters from several
people who accompanied de Gaulle, including Adm. Andre Patou, who
was a captain at the time and skipper of La Combattante, and Gen.
Pierre Koenig. All say Courseulles was the landing place.
   ``We are fighting for the historical truth, and that's all,''
Simon said. He denied any other motives.
   Courseulles is a tourist town that grows to between 18,000 and
20,000 people in summer and during school holidays. It has a
marvelous beach, hotels, swimming pools, tennis, stables and a
chateau, as well as a thriving oyster business and boat-building.
   Graye, rich in charm, has remained a sleepy country village.
   Mayor Grimaux, a boy of 12 at the time, said his certainty that
de Gaulle landed in Graye came from Lt. Col. W.J. Humphrey, a
Briton who was beachmaster on the Graye-Courseulles sector of the
Juno Beach landing area.
   According to Grimaux, Humphrey said all VIPs to the newly
liberated sectors of Normandy, including Winston Churchill and King
George VI, landed directly in front of the beachmaster's
headquarters, which was clearly in Graye. It also was Humphrey who
provided de Gaulle with a Jeep, the mayor said.
   Grimaux has clippings from the local newspaper in 1946 quoting
de Gaulle as telling a previous Graye mayor: ``I will never forget
your community. It is there that I landed.''
   La Presse de Calvados added editorially: ``A decisive word that
puts an end to certain controversies.''
   When a site was chosen for the Lorraine cross, the town boundary
of Courseulles was moved 65 yards west so the monument straddles it.
   Simon, the Courseulles councilman, found that a ``grotesque''
solution, but said: ``We gave in to a compromise to be reasonable,
not because it's right.''
   Grimaux said: ``All that interests me is the truth.''

   The wreck of the Exxon Valdez forced more
scrutiny and higher costs on Alaska's oil industry and may have
delayed for years the exploration for new oil in the state's vast
arctic wilderness.
   In the six weeks from the tanker disaster to the Legislature's
mandated adjournment, lawmakers raised industry taxes and spill
fines, strengthened plans for spill prevention and cleanup and set
up an independent investigatory commission.
   This year, even as the reform momentum slows, they are
considering more ``spill bills,'' including a package by Gov. Steve
Cowper that would allow the state to inspect tankers and increase
liability requirements for companies transporting or storing oil.
   Such enthusiasm for reining in Alaska's largest and most
lucrative industry would have been inconceivable before March 24,
1989, the day of the Big Spill.
   Alaska depends on oil like no other state, deriving about 85
percent of its revenues from oil taxes and royalties. Its 531,000
residents pay no state sales or income taxes, yet the state leads
the nation in per-capita spending.
   At the same time, the thick flow of crude has helped the state
amass a $10.5 billion savings account. Its earnings yield an annual
``dividend'' to every Alaskan; last year's was $873.
   ``For a decade, we had seen nothing but the up side, which was
state revenues with no pain to the public,'' said Senate President
Tim Kelly, a Republican. ``What we saw from the Exxon Valdez was
the down side of the oil business.''
   The oil stains and smears left on the treasured landscape of
Prince William Sound angered Alaskans, who felt betrayed by their
favored industry and by their legislators. No one was spared the
finger-pointing.
   ``We got slapped around,'' said House Speaker Sam Cotten, a
Democrat.
   So did the industry.
   ``It was almost the oil industry vs. the state of Alaska,'' said
Bill Webb, general manager of the pro-oil Alaska Support Industry
Alliance. ``That's a dangerous position for a state to be in with
its largest industry.''
   The emotion in which eight spill bills were swiftly passed last
spring has dissipated. But it's an election year, and environmental
protection remains a priority. Legislators predict passage of three
or four more oil-related bills by May.
   ``We were the Legislature on watch when this thing happened,''
Cotten said. ``So it's really up to us to get it all done.''
   But some say much remains to be done.
   Sue Libenson, executive director of the Alaska Center for the
Environment, said the state's response has been overrated. Last
year's spill bills were ``stopgap measures'' that dealt only with
the immediate disaster, she said.
   ``We didn't see anything that would really prevent future
spills,'' she said. `We have yet to create any new policies to give
real long-term incentives to polluters not to pollute.''
   And lawmakers, with more time to reflect, no longer are rushing
to vote against the oil industry.
   ``The lynch-mob mentality has left the Legislature and cooler
heads are starting to prevail,'' said Rep. Robin Taylor, House
minority leader.
   That is welcome news for Jim Palmer, a spokesman for BP
Exploration (Alaska) Inc., an arm of giant British Petroleum.
   ``Last year, if any piece of legislation had `oil spill' on it,
it was automatically assumed correct and needed without as much
scrutiny as normally is given,'' Palmer said. ``This year that has
changed. All different views on the thing are being heard ...
including ours.''
   Legislators also worry about the spill's effect on oil
exploration. The disaster held up legislation in Congress that
would have opened the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for
exploration.
   The huge fields at nearby Prudhoe Bay supply about 25 percent of
the nation's domestic oil, but production is declining. The best
hope to maintain production and keep revenues flowing may be the
wildlife refuge, known to Alaskans by its acronym ANWR.
   Support for opening the refuge to exploration remains strong in
Alaska, despite the Exxon Valdez spill.
   ``The majority of the Legislature and the majority of Alaskans
continue to support the safe and orderly development of ANWR,''
said Kelly, the Senate president. ``On the national level, the
spill probably held it back a year or two.''
   Alaska's sole congressman, Republican Don Young, is optimistic
Congress eventually will act on the refuge.
   ``The nation needs ANWR opened because we're importing over 50
percent of our oil, a position that is much more precarious than
during the 1973 oil embargo,'' when the United States imported 36
percent of its oil, Young said.
   But the wreck of the Exxon Valdez gave environmentalists a new
weapon against opening the refuge.
   ``It's made everyone sit up and say: `Gee, is it really worth
the risk? Are the oil industry's assurances that everything will be
fine something that we can rely on?''' said Mike Wenig, attorney
for the environmental group Trustees of Alaska.
   As the spill has focused attention on Alaska's oil dependence,
the state has continued efforts to diversify its economy. Exports
of seafood, timber and minerals were up sharply last year, and
Anchorage got a boost when Federal Express chose the city as its
international cargo hub.
   But economic diversification will be tough to achieve in this
remote state.
   ``We're just not close enough to the marketplaces to compete in
software, high technology or something of that nature,'' Kelly
said. ``So with the exception of tourism, in the foreseeable
decades we are going to be a resource-development state.''
   And the most profitable resource in Alaska remains oil.
   ``Nobody wants to get out of the oil business in Alaska,'' Kelly
said. ``It's just too lucrative.''

<HEAD>Religious Leaders Pressuring Politicians on Abortion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When a Roman Catholic bishop banned a
candidate for the California Senate from receiving communion
because she supports legal abortions, the voters delivered her an
upset victory.
   And when New York Gov. Mario Cuomo was threatened with the fires
of hell, he shrugged off a bishop's attempt to change his stand on
abortion.
   Despite such failures, religious leaders _ particularly Roman
Catholics _ have increased their efforts to influence politicians
on abortion, according to abortion-rights activists.
   The pressure tactics have touched off a debate in political and
theological circles about the role of the church in modern politics.
   It is a revival of the controversy John F. Kennedy had to quiet
before winning the presidency 30 years ago, and that presidential
nominee Al Smith faced as a Catholic before him.
   ``The prelates seem to imply that Al Smith and John Kennedy were
wrong in contending that Catholics in politics are as free as
communicants of other faiths,'' historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr.
wrote in the New York Times. ``... If they had spoken then as they
speak now, John F. Kennedy would never have been elected
president.''
   The anti-abortion pressure from religious leaders is not coming
solely from Catholics.
   A state representative in New Hampshire, Republican Stephanie
Micklon, was barred from membership in the charismatic American
Baptist Church that she grew up in after she sponsored a bill to
put a woman's right to an abortion into state law.
   Micklon was told she was ``not religiously acceptable'' to her
church and that she ``brought disgrace upon the name of Jesus
Christ,'' she said.
   ``This is religious blackmail,'' she said. ``If I had changed my
vote, I was religiously acceptable.''
   The salvation of Cuomo, a Catholic and potential 1992 Democratic
presidential candidate, was called into question when Auxiliary
Bishop Austin Vaughan in January said the governor ``takes a very
serious risk of going straight to hell'' for supporting abortion
rights.
   Cuomo gives Roman Catholic bishops credit for helping foster
national debate on abortion but he says they can expect a backlash
when they attempt to influence elections.
   ``I don't think we can exempt them from the demands of prudence
in the political arena,'' he wrote in a letter to the Catholic lay
journal Commonweal Magazine this month.
   Some other political analysts agree.
   ``When the church gets too heavyhanded, they have problems,''
said Charles Cook, author of a Washington-based political
newsletter. ``They can work quietly and it's effective, but when
they go too far it's going to hurt them.''
   A state Senate race in California last fall is cited as one
example.
   Democrat Lucy Killea, running in a special election, was barred
from taking communion because of her support for abortion rights.
Her subsequent victory was widely credited to the attention and
sympathy generated by the ban imposed by Bishop Leo Maher of San
Diego.
   Catholics for Free Choice, a private group that supports
abortion rights, said it knows of cases where Catholic public
officeholders or candidates have been pressured by church leaders
over the abortion issue in at least eight states. Frances Kissling,
president of the group, cited cases in Montana, Connecticut,
Pennsylvania, Alaska, Washington, New York, New Jersey and
California.
   She said Killea is the only known case where a Catholic
politician has been denied communion because of abortion views. But
others, she said, have felt ``more subtle threats.''
   ``They're afraid _ afraid they're going to get up one morning
and be refused communion, afraid they're going to be embarrassed by
church officials,'' she said.
   The efforts have not not changed minds on the issue, Kissling
contends, but have caused some officials to shrink from leadership
roles, such as sponsoring legislation.
   Although Kissling worries about a ``chilling effect,'' some
political leaders say they see no evidence that church activity is
hurting the abortion-rights cause.
   ``It can be a powerful tool, but I think it's backfiring,'' said
Kate Michelman, head of the National Abortion Rights Action League.
``There's a great sensitivity in this country to separation of
church and state.''
   The National Right to Life Committee, the leading anti-abortion
lobbying group, works with church groups but distances itself from
the actions of religious leaders.
   ``We just don't really get involved in religious issues,'' said
spokeswoman Nancy Myers.
   The complaints about religious meddling in the politics of
abortion come as Catholic leaders appear to be asserting themselves
more on public policy issues, said the Rev. Richard Neuhaus, a
Lutheran who is director of the Institute on Religion and Public
Life in New York.
   ``I think there is a new consensus among the bishops that there
is a new level of agreement and urgency in making the church's
teachings credible ... with public officeholders,'' he said.
   Catholic bishops approved a resolution last November that put a
priority on lobbying against abortion rights. It urged public
officials, ``especially Catholics, to advance these goals in
recognition of their moral responsibility.''
   Cardinal John O'Connor, chairman of the bishops' Committee for
Pro-Life Activities, wrote each member of Congress this month to
state opposition to a bill that would write the Supreme Court's
abortion guarantees into federal law. He sent each congressman a
picture of an 18-week-old fetus to illustrate ``the insanity of our
nation's current policy sanctioning abortion on demand.''
   Kissling sees evidence Catholic leaders are pursuing ``an
overall strategy'' to pressure officeholders that goes beyond mere
lobbying, an activity she does not question.
   But Bob Wonderly, a spokesman for the U.S. Catholic Conference,
the public policy and lobbying arm of the church, said there was no
agreement to sanction churchgoers whose public actions are at odds
with the church on abortion.
   ``Each bishop is doing what he feels is necessary to fulfill his
ministry,'' Wonderly said.

   A year after the Alaska oil spill, some
experts still point to Exxon Corp.'s reaction as a virtual primer
on how not to handle a disaster.
   ``To be nice, I'd say they did not distinguish themselves,''
said Gerald Meyers, former chairman and chief executive officer of
American Motors and author of a book on corporate crisis control,
``When It Hits The Fan.''
   ``To be more blunt, they screwed up,'' he said. ``For whatever
reason, the company appeared to be indifferent or uncaring or
unconcerned while hundreds of sea otters and all kinds of wildlife
were washing up on shore.''
   Marilou Hedlund, managing director of the Hill &amp; Knowlton public
relations firm in Chicago, said several new clients came to her
saying, in essence, ``We don't want to have what happened to Exxon
happen to us.''
   Reporters had trouble getting comment from Exxon about the March
24 spill, and company Chairman Lawrence G. Rawls stayed away from
the area and didn't appear before reporters until April 18.
   Within hours of the spill, a local group volunteered to mobilize
fishing boats to help move in equipment to keep the oil from
spreading. But, in another example of what critics label Exxon's
clumsiness, the company never returned their call, the group's
members said. By the time Exxon responded with its own equipment, a
storm had moved through the area and spread the oil over a wider
region.
   The Associated Press called Exxon asking to discuss its handling
of spills, but officials at the corporation's New York
headquarters, its subsidiary's headquarters in Houston and its
Bayway refinery in Linden, N.J., all declined comment.
   Ms. Hedlund and other crisis managers, a burgeoning sub-field of
public relations, live by a simple maxim: There's no substitute for
practice.
   ``We do crisis training with our clients, actually create an
incredible crisis and simulated news and radio reports and see how
they handle them,'' she said.
   Ms. Hedlund said she also refers clients to several ``textbook
examples'' of good crisis management, including United Airlines'
handling of the crash of Flight 232 in Iowa last summer and Johnson
&amp; Johnson's of the nightmarish Tylenol poisonings of the early
1980s.
   ``The key to the success of both cases was the company's
immediate release of everything they knew and their handling of
victims' families,'' she said.
   Meyers said British Petroleum's recent oil spill off Huntington
Beach, Calif., provides another good example.
   ``They learned from Exxon, no doubt,'' he said. ``BP's chairman,
Jim Ross, flew there almost immediately and showed a take-charge
attitude. That was a very bad scene _ an oil spill right in the
cradle of the environmental movement. But they weathered the
storm.''
   Exxon recently halted oil loading and unloading operations at
its only East Coast refinery after three spills in two months in
New York City-area waters, even though only one of the spills was
directly tied to Exxon property.
   The shutdown illustrates Exxon's tension over its public image
in the year since its tanker split open in Alaska's Prince William
Sound, said Simon Trimble, international oils analyst for the
investment firm Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York.
   These days, Trimble said, ``it doesn't take 10 million barrels
of oil spilled into American waters for there to be a negative
impact on Exxon.''

   The government said the deficit in the
broadest measure of U.S. trade sank to a five-year low last year,
but the $105.9 billion imbalance still pushed the country deeper
into the hole as the world's largest debtor nation.
   America's current account balance narrowed by 16 percent over a
$126.6 billion deficit in 1988, reflecting growth in exports,
higher overseas earnings of American businesses and increased
spending by visiting foreign tourists, the Commerce Department said
Tuesday.
   The year ended on a positive note as the October-December trade
deficit declined to $20.57 billion, down 10.2 percent from its
third quarter level. It was the smallest quarterly imbalance in

Inc., increasing the financial pressures on the debt-burdened
retailing chain.
   Macy, which went private in a leveraged buyout in 1986, said
Tuesday the markdowns it was forced to take to compete with price
cutting at Campeau Corp.'s department stores took a heavy toll on
its balance sheet.
   The loss, which translated to $27.67 per share, compared with
the $72.6 million, or $39.85 per share, Macy earned in the same
period a year earlier.
   Sales during the quarter ended Jan. 27 totaled $2.44 billion, up
from $2.28 billion a year earlier.
   Pamela Stubing, a retail industry analyst with Moody's Investors
Service Inc., said many of Macy's stores in the Northeast had stiff
competition from Campeau's Federated Department Stores and Allied
Stores units. Macy, choosing to defend market share rather than
profit margins, cut prices to keep its customers, she said.
   Federated and Allied, which were on the brink of a Chapter 11
bankruptcy court filing, slashed their prices during the holiday
season to bring in cash.
   The loss could not have come at a worse time. Macy's second
quarter _ the fourth quarter for most other major retailers _ is
when the company hopes to earn half its annual profits.
   The company also is dependent on its cash flow to pay down the
remaining debt from its leveraged buyout. Macy's earnings statement
reported nearly $4.54 billion in long-term debt as of Jan. 27, and
$189 million in interest charges during the second quarter.
   Walter Loeb, a retail consultant and analyst, said Macy also was
hurt by overstocking its private label merchandise. To reduce
inventory, the company again was forced to cut its prices, he said.
   But the company succeeded in cushioning the shock about the
dismal quarter, having signaled to investors and its suppliers some
time ago that it expected to report a sharp loss, Loeb said.
   Loeb said Macy's will continue to have problems in the near
term, but he said there were signs the retailer would fare better
during the spring because of warmer weather and because the company
is going into the season with a leaner inventory.
   In a letter to its investors dated Monday, Macy said it was
prepared for the economy to remain flat during the spring and fall
seasons, indicating the retailer does not expect a burst of
consumer spending.
   Ms. Stubing predicted the retail environment would be less
promotional _ meaning fewer markdowns to draw customers _ during
Macy's second half, although the company still faces tough
competition.
   For the first six months of its fiscal year, Macy lost $72.2
million, or the equivalent of $51.58 per share, compared to
earnings of $53.6 million, or $24.75 per share, in the same period
a year ago.
   Sales for the first half rose to $4.15 billion from $3.9 billion.
   Loeb said the financial and retail industries have confidence in
Macy Chairman Edward Finkelstein, who shaped the company's buyout
and its retailing strategy.
   Besides its flagship Macy stores, located mainly in the East and
Texas, the company owns I. Magnin and Bullock's stores in
California and the West. It also owns specialty stores including
Charter Club and Aeropostale, which are stocked with Macy's private
label apparel brands.

<HEAD>Exports At Record Level in '89</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exports of U.S. paper products rose 9.1 percent
last year to a new record, while paper imports declined for the
first time in seven years, the American Paper Institute Inc.
reported.
   The industry exported 17.2 million metric tons of paper
products, which were worth $15.4 billion. The value of the exports
rose 15.4 percent from the previous year.
   API vice president Irene Meister, who released the report
Tuesday at an annual industry conference here, noted that the
industry's strong performance resulted from ``years of productivity
gains and the high level of capital investment in new capacity.''
   Exports of newsprint and printing-writing paper posted the
biggest categorical gains, jumping 46 percent and 66 percent,
respectively. The institute noted, however, that the gains came on
the heels of a relatively low year.
   Imports of paper goods declined slightly to 16.6 million metric
tons _ valued at $11.5 billion _ after rising every year since
1982. Wood pulp and newsprint, mainly from Canada, accounted for 70
percent of the imports.
   Newsprint consumption in the United States held relatively
steady at 12.3 million tons in 1989, according to Virgin Horton,
vice president of the API's paper group.
   U.S. paper mills shipped 5.52 million tons of newsprint, up
100,000 tons from the previous year.
   Horton noted that demand for newsprint is dependent upon
newspaper advertising linage and circulation, which should hold
steady in coming years.
   Circulation has been flat over the past decade, he said, adding
that consumers generaly do not alter their newspaper reading habits
during a recession. And the amount of advertising dollars allocated
to newspapers has also held relatively steady in recent years.
   The U.S. paper industry is celebrating its 300th year. The API
is sponsoring the 113th annual paper week this week at the
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.

<HEAD>Baseball Lockout Forces Media Companies to Make Alternate Plans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If the baseball lockout never ends, what will
the sports media write and talk about this summer?
   Some media companies already are juggling their plans even as
they hope they will never have to answer that question.
   The lockout has blocked the opening of spring training camps for
nearly a month, and it already has cost the ESPN cable network five
of the 10 spring training games it planned to televise this year.
   Potential problems loom for CBS, which is to begin broadcasting
baseball in April; The National, the new daily sports newspaper,
and The Sporting News, the sports weekly.
   ``It hasn't affected us yet, but baseball is the only game in
town in the summertime,'' said Tom Osenton, president and chief
executive of The Sporting News Publishing Co. in St. Louis. ``If
you take the game away, you have nothing to write about.''
   ESPN is in the first season of its $400 million contract to
carry up to 175 games in each of the next four years.
   ``Getting that contract was such an exciting moment for us,''
said Mike Soltys, manager of programming information for ESPN. ``To
start out in this manner is certainly discouraging.''
   The network filled the gaps created by the lost games with live
tennis, auto racing and other programming it had originally planned
to tape for later replay, he said.
   Plans are to substitute a college basketball playoff game, a
college baseball game and college wrestling, among other events if
the remaining spring training games are canceled, Soltys said.
   He said the network is sticking with its plans to run a baseball
show, Baseball Tonight, seven nights a week starting as scheduled
next Monday.
   If the lockout continues, the show will deal with developments
in negotiations between the players and owners and may feature
coverage of minor league baseball, he said.
   But ESPN faces a more serious problem in April, when it planned
to begin carrying six games a week. The network has hired 19
commentators to handle the nightly baseball show and the games,
Soltys said, and has sold more than 60 percent of its season's
advertising inventory in the games.
   Soltys said the advertisers are being given the options of
appearing on the replacement programs, holding off until the games
start or getting refunds.
   But he said the lockout has hurt the climate for selling
advertising. ``There is no way of knowing where we would be without
this,'' he said.
   Soltys said ``there are provisions for lost games'' under the
network contract with baseball, but he refused to describe them. A
source familiar with the contract said ESPN and CBS will be given
additional games in the next three years for games lost this year.
   The lockout has posed a less serious problem so far for CBS,
which agreed to pay $1.06 billion for the right to broadcast 16
regular season games, the All-Star game, the playoffs and World
Series every year for four years.
   CBS' first baseball broadcasts are scheduled for April 14 and
April 21, but its third broadcast is not scheduled until June 16.
   CBS Sports spokesman Tony Fox said the network has not decided
what sports programs will replace the April game broadcasts.
   Fox said more than half of CBS' advertising inventory for
baseball had been sold, but he declined to discuss what plans were
being made for advertisers if games are canceled.
   The network plans to run its baseball season preview show on
March 31 as scheduled no matter what happens with the lockout, Fox
said.
   As at The Sporting News, the lockout has had little impact so
far on The National, according to editor-in-chief Frank Deford. The
newspaper debuted Jan. 31 in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.
   Deford said readers of The National usually are interested in
several sports, and there has been plenty of activity recently in
college and professional basketball, boxing and hockey to interest
them.
   But if the baseball lockout continues into mid-summer, ``that
would be a real blow to us, there is no question.''
   At The Sporting News, Osenton said plans are being made to beef
up basketball and hockey coverage over the next few weeks and said
if the lockout persists, the tabloid may increase coverage of minor
league baseball.
   Deford said it was unlikely The National would start covering
minor league or Japanese baseball because he doen't think readers
want it. ``You can't give people something they don't want,'' he
said.
   He said if the lockout continued into June, there probably would
be more coverage of major tennis, soccer, golf and swimming events.
He said the paper also could be trimmed to 32 pages from the 40-48
pages it has been running.
   Deford professes to be unconcerned and has made no contingency
plans. ``My best judgment is I cannot conceive of a situation where
they will not be back by June,'' he said.

<HEAD>Program Trading Curb Clears Another Legislative Hurdle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill giving the Securities and Exchange
Commission authority to curb program trading in stock market
emergencies has moved a step closer to law despite objections from
the Treasury Department.
   The Securities Markets Stabilization Act was approved
unanimously on a voice vote Tuesday by the House Energy and
Commerce Committee.
   The bill would allow the SEC to limit program trading and other
activities ``during periods of extraordinary market volatility.''
   But the scope of that power was narrowed in an amendment to the
bill, which now goes to the full House for approval.
   The Treasury Department made public a letter from Undersecretary
Robert R. Glauber to the committee opposing a program trading
restriction, stating the department believed the reform bill was
``too important to be jeopardized by a controversial and
unnecessary provision to shut down program trading.''
   Meanwhile, a member of the panel said he plans to introduce
legislation _ with a member of the House Agriculture Committee _ to
unify jurisdiction for hybrid financial instruments under one
agency.
   The SEC, which regulates securities, and the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, which oversees the futures markets, have been
waging a turf battle over new financial products tha fall in the
middle.
   Often called hybrids, they have characteristics of both
securities and futures. A federal appeals court ruled last year
that securities with any aspect of a futures contract should come
under the CFTC's jurisdiction, prompting the SEC and the exchanges
it regulates to seek reform.
   Rep. Dennis E. Eckart, D-Ohio, said he and Rep. Dan Glickman,
D-Kan., would introduce ``comprehensive institutional reform
between the SEC and the CFTC to give jursdiction for all these
hybrid instruments to one agency.''
   Glickman said said he didn't want to give the jurisdiction to
either the SEC or CFTC but sought to ``establish a new federal
regulatory body to oversee futures options, securities and related
instruments.''
   He said the proposed legislation was still in the formative
stages and a long way from being introduced.
   ``Until we see something of a concrete nature, we really can't
comment. It would be premature,'' said CFTC spokesman David Gary.
He added: ``We continue to support the concept of exclusive
jurisdiction.''
   The proposed bill with the program trading reforms was an
outgrowth of the 1987 stock market crash. It also would require
securities firms to keep and supply information to federal
regulators about the financial health of their parent holding
companies.
   A similar market reform bill, but without a program trading
provision, is pending before the Senate.
   The program trading amendment would limit SEC control powers to
activities previously determined to cause or contribute to
extraordinary volatility _ that is, sharp rises and drops in stock
prices. Such a determination would be made through the SEC's often
time consuming rule-making procedure of public hearings, comment
letter and staff review.
   The change satisfied Rep. Norman Lent, R-N.Y., whose objections
to anti-program trading language in a previous version of the bill
prevented its quick approval by the full committee last fall.
   At that time, he and other members of the telecommunications and
finance subcommittee, argued that language introduced by Rep.
Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., the subcommittee chairman, was vague and
ambiguous.
   Originally Markey wanted to limit activity that was
``disruptive, abusive or manipulative.''
   Markey said the new language was worked out after three months
of negotiations among committee Democrats and Republicans, the SEC
and the securities industry.
   ``I can't say I'm thrilled with the version we have before us,
but it's a long way from the original version,'' said Lent.
   The bill also empowers the SEC to obtain information and monitor
large securities transactions and to halt trading, with the
president's assent, during market emergencies.

   CARE, famous for donating food, digging canals
and building hospitals in the Third World, has devised a new form
of aid for the 1990s: debt relief, investment banking and venture
capital.
   The New York-based nonprofit organization has formed a
subsidiary aimed at assisting heavily indebted developing countries
devise innovative ways to reduce dependence on foreign loans.
   CARE's Small Business Assistance Corp. also can help foreign
lenders recover some of the money they have sunk into Latin America
and other black holes of debt over the years, subsidiary president
Donald Nicholson said.
   The subsidiary invests in small and medium-sized businesses,
from fruit canners in Honduras to shrimp farmers in the
Philippines, when invited by the host country. It also is exploring
business ventures in other countries undergoing profound political
change, including Poland and Nicaragua.
   Philanthropy and finance experts said the CARE subsidiary is the
first investment banking venture formed by an international relief
group to help developing countries become more self-reliant.
   Still, with total Third World foreign debt of $1.2 trillion,
CARE's effort is expected to have only a symbolic impact at first.
   ``I've never heard of a relief group doing this,'' said an
official at the World Bank in Washington, who asked not to be
quoted by name. ``But we've always said that anything helps. Any
sensible approach with the interests of all parties at hand,
building small bridges, is welcomed.''
   The CARE subsidiary will hold a minority stake in companies it
invests in and will concentrate on businesses worth $250,000 to
$2.5 million. Foreign banks and other creditors that contribute to
the subsidiary's investment fund will receive dividends if the
businesses are profitable.
   ``We're not going to solve the problems of heavily indebted
Third World countries,'' Nicholson said. ``But we bring a unique
approach to the Third World crisis because we're not for profit.''
   Nicholson said he has talked with Citibank, Chase Manhattan Bank
and Bankers Trust about restructuring part of their Third World
debt through the CARE subsidiary.
   He said CARE's clean reputation and cultural sensitivity in
foreign countries give it advantages that larger, for-profit
companies might never obtain.
   ``We are identifying existing, viable businesses in the
developing world and investing in them, especially those that can
earn hard currency through exports,'' he said. ``Profits realized
from this will be used to fund CARE development projects around the
world.''
   The CARE venture coincides with economic shifts making it more
difficult for developing countries to get aid from their
industralized counterparts, putting increased pressure on
philanthropies and volunteer groups to fill the breach.
   Many large Western banks, for example, burned by billions of
dollars in bad loans to Latin America, are toughening terms for
extending more credit. The United States, historically a leading
source of aid to the developing world, is becoming more stingy
because of its large federal deficit.
   A number of banks have sought to reduce Third World debt
exposure by converting some debt into local currency to be invested
domestically. Others have tinkered with ways of repackaging or
swapping debt for other types of securities, such as the stock of a
company based in a debtor country.
   ``What CARE has done has in effect set up its own specific
mechanism to carry out these type of transactions,'' said Peter J.
Davies, president and chief executive officer of InterAction, a New
York-based coalition of 120 private voluntary relief organizations.
   James McDermott, a banking analyst at the New York investment
firm Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods, said most major banks already have
taken steps to protect themselves from Third World loans. But he
said they are always looking at other ways to reduce the risk.
   ``The whole process is chipping away at exposure,'' he said.
``This (CARE subsidiary) seems to be part of that process.''
   Nicholson, a 51-year-old American raised in Peru, long has been
active in Third World investment banking. He founded Axion Group, a
venture capital firm that invests in developing countries.
   CARE, the acronym for the Cooperative for American Relief
Everywhere Inc., is is one of the biggest international aid groups,
formed at the end of World War II to send emergency supplies to
refugees.
   Its 7,200 employees and thousands of volunteers worldwide now
distribute more than $300 million worth of aid annually.

<HEAD>Reynolds Metals' Annual Report Offers More than Charts and Tables</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Investors who get tired of looking at the
endless charts and tables in corporate financial reports will find
some relief in Reynolds Metals Co.'s annual review: coupons for the
company's supermarket products.
   For the shareholder who also pushes a grocery cart, Reynolds is
offering savings up to $1.50 off its Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil
and two new products.
   Tucked between the listings of ``shipments and net sales by
year'' and ``equity, interest and other income'' in the company's
1989 annual report released last week are three 50-cents-off
coupons for the foil, Sure-Seal plastic storage bags and ``Crystal
Color'' plastic wrap. The plastic wrap comes in clear, blue, green,
yellow and rose.
   The colors satisfy the desires of consumers ``to enliven mundane
work,'' the company said in a summary of its consumer products
business, which had $723 million in sales last year, up from $591
million in 1988.
   T $6.2 billion Richmond-based company put its coupons in a
pull-out insert along with a message from William O. Bourke,
Reynolds' board chairman and chief executive officer.
   Reynolds ``would appreciate your support of our new products,''
Bourke's message said. ``We believe you will appreciate the
Reynolds quality that has made our consumer products so
successful.''

<HEAD>Group Launches Proxy Battle For Avon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of powerful investors, including the
owners of Mary Kay Cosmetics and a Getty family trust, has come
through on its promise to launch a proxy battle seeking four seats
on the board of Avon Products Inc.
   In a full-page advertisement in today's editions of The New York
Times, Chartwell Associates L.P. said its directors, if elected,
would work to ``maximize shareholder value'' by selling Avon to a
buyer who can develop the company's ``true potential.''
   The group noted it may propose merging with Avon itself.
   Chartwell said it currently holds 9.9 percent of the company's
outstanding stock, making it one of Avon's largest shareholders.
   The proxy battle does not come as a surprise. Chartwell outlined
its plans for a contest in a filing last month with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. At the time Chartwell controlled 9.1
percent of Avon's stock.
   Partners in Chartwell Associates include the Fisher real estate
family of New York as well as the family trust of oil heir Gordon
P. Getty and a subsidiary of Dallas-based Mary Kay Corp., the
parent of Mary Kay Cosmetics.
   Avon Chairman James E. Preston had met Chartwell representatives
last month and told the group New York-based Avon is not for sale.
   In its ad, Chartwell said it will seek four seats on Avon's
11-member board.
   In criticizing Avon management, Chartwell noted that the
company's stock price declined 39 percent from a high of $56 a
share in 1979 to $34 at the end of last week. Earnings per share
fluctuated from $4.17 in 1979 to $2.10 last year, the group said.
   In addition, Chartwell complained that Avon spent more than $1.2
billion to expand into heathcare and specialty chemical businesses
but then was forced to dispose of some of those businesses after
losing more than $1 billion.
   ``We believe that Avon's current board and management simply do
not understand their core direct-selling business and its enormous
potential and will not be able to deliver the performance they have
promised,'' Chartwell said in the ad.
   Preston recently told securities analysts that Avon expects
profits to improve ``substantially'' this year on a modest increase
in sales.
   Preston had emphasized in his meeting with Chartwell that Avon's
sales representatives wouldn't welcome any link to Mary Kay
whatsoever. He said Mary Kay had become ``the enemy'' to Avon
representatives. Chartwell has maintained that it would not propose
combining Avon and Mary Kay.
   Chartwell said in its SEC filing that ``in no event ... will
Mary Kay or Mary Kay Cosmetics Inc. merge with the company nor will
the sales forces of the company and MKCI be integrated or combined
with each other in any manner whatsoever.''
   Last year Avon earned $54.6 million after a deficit of $404.5
million in 1988 when it had $545.6 million in losses from
discontinued operations. Among other Avon shareholders with
significant holdings are Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs and
Texas financier Robert Bass.

<HEAD>Greyhound Says It Will Talk With Union At Mediator's Request</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greyhound Lines Inc. agreed to resume talks with
the union representing its bus drivers for the first time since the
violence-marred walkout began nearly two weeks ago.
   The Dallas-based company said Tuesday it had agreed to begin the
talks Saturday in Phoenix at the request of Bernard DeLury, head of
the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.
   The company's announcement seemed to catch union officials off
guard.
   ``If this is true, we welcome the opportunity to talk to the
company. This is what we have been seeking all along,'' said James
La Sala, international president of the Amalgamated Transit Union.
   At least seven shooting incidents have been reported since the
strike began March 2, including one in Florida where eight people
were injured. A picketing driver was crushed to death by a bus on
the second day of the strike.
   On Tuesday, a sniper shot at a moving Greyhound bus in Chicago.
In Fresno, Calif., a Greyhound-owned Trailways bus parked in a
storage yard was set on fire Monday night, police said. No one was
injured in either episode.
   Greyhound had refused to resume negotiations unless the union
offered new proposals. Spokesman George Gravley had said Tuesday he
did not know if the union had changed its offer.
   ``There's no point in our speculating what may happen,'' Gravley
said. ``We are going back to the bargaining table and that speaks
for itself.''
   Greyhound, the only nationwide bus company, has been operating
on a reduced schedule to the 9,600 communities it serves, using
permanent replacements and union members willing to cross the
picket line.
   Greyhound has said it cannot afford more than the $63 million,
three-year pact it offered. The company valued the union's last
offer at $207 million, although the union said it would cost much
less.
   The differences apparently stem from questions over the cost of
measures such as benefits, safety pay incentives and productivity
raises.
   In the shooting, at 1:15 a.m., two bullets hit the front end of
the bus, one hit the door and one went through a window and ``just
missed a fellow's head by a couple inches,'' said Master Sgt. John
Meduga of the Illinois State Police.
   ``Everybody started to scream,'' Meduga said.
   Gravley said he had no evidence to connect the latest shooting
to the strike, but added, ``We don't have buses shot at when we're
not negotiating a contract.''
   Union officials have condemned the violence, which has included
three shootings in Chicago and shootings in Ohio, Arizona, Florida
and Connecticut.
   Greyhound spokeswoman Liz Hale said a $25,000 reward remained in
effect for information on a sniper who shot a bus Sunday in
Jacksonville, Fla., injuring eight passengers with shrapnel and
other debris.
   In Pittsburgh, meanwhile, the city council issued a resolution
encouraging residents to boycott Greyhound buses until the strike
is over. The council accused Greyhound of an ``utter lack of good
faith toward its employees.''

<TEXT>
   An actor playing a heart attack victim tells the
TV camera that Fleischmann's corn oil margarine commercial ``does
your heart good.'' You won't be seeing him any more.
   The attorneys general of 10 states, including New York,
complained that the ad doesn't do consumers good. It's confusing,
they said.
   Nabisco Brands agreed Tuesday not to revive that ad, as well as
commercials that tout the health benefits and nutrition of Shredded
Wheat and 100 Percent Bran Cereal.
   New York Attorney General Robert Abrams said Nabisco
advertisements ``misled consumers to believe that its Fleischmann's
margarine could, by itself, reduce cholesterol and prevent heart
disease.''
   He said Nabisco also misrepresented the fiber content of
Shredded Wheat and implied that 100 Percent Bran is sweetened
exclusively with natural fruit juices.
   The corporation agreed to shelve the commercials but admitted
nothing.
   Hank Sandbach, a spokesman for Nabisco, said: ``Consumer Reports
said Shredded Wheat had `plenty of fiber,' and our advertising said
that a leading magazine called the cereal `high in fiber.'''
   As for 100 Percent Bran, Sandbach said the Nabisco advertising
claim that the product was ``sweetened with two natural fruit
juices'' in no way implied the absence of other sweeteners.
   Nabisco signed the agreement with the 10 states and agreed to
pay $135,000 in legal costs.
   Under the agreement, Nabisco promised:
   _not to broadcast television commercials for Fleischmann's corn
oil margarine that use the phrase ``head start to a healthier
heart'' and ``does your heart good'';
   _not to state or imply that the products will ``cure, mitigate,
treat, prevent or reduce the risk of heart disease or cause a
reduction in cholesterol;''
   _not to advertise that ``a leading consumer magazine'' has
concluded that Shredded Wheat is ``high'' in fiber;
   _not to advertise 100 Percent Bran as ``flavored with two
naturally sweet fruit juices'' unless or until such sweeteners are
used exclusively.
   The agreement also was signed by the attorneys general of
California, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, Minnesota,
Missouri, Texas and Wisconsin.
   Hank Sandbach, a spokesman for the New York-based company, said
that under the agreement, Nabisco did not admit to any wrongdoing.
   He also said the advertisements, on television and on box tops,
had not been used for nearly a year.
   ``They were retired for market reasons,'' he said. ``They'd done
their job and ran their course.''
   The Nabisco agreement came a week after the federal Food and
Drug Administration announced plans for sweeping changes in
food-labeling laws that would require information on fat and
cholesterol on many foods.

   Christies International PLC, the British auction
house, said Wednesday that strong sales in its major art categories
helped push its 1989 profit up 60 percent from a year ago.
   Christies said last year's net profit totaled $64 million,
compared with $40 million in 1988. Sales soared 71 percent to $2.1
billion from $1.25 billion, it said.
   ``These results mark an outstanding year at the end of a
remarkable decade,'' said Christies Chairman Lord Carrington.
   Impressionist and modern art, the single largest area of sales,
recorded an 88 percent rise to $844 million last year. Contemporary
art increased 143 percent to $188 million, while Old Masters jumped
125 percent to $153 million. The company didn't break out quarterly
or six month results. It isn't required to under British law.

   A federal judge is taking a constitutional
challenge of President Bush's savings and loan bailout under
consideration after acknowledging the tremendous impact of a ruling
against the government.
   Olympic Federal Savings and Loan Association of Berwyn, Ill.,
asked U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth on Tuesday to block any
federal takeover of the weakly capitalized S&amp;L.
   Its attorneys argued that the top federal S&amp;L regulator is
holding his position unconstitutionally and thus any move by him to
seize Olympic would be illegal.
   Government attorneys disputed the argument, but said that in any
case the public interest in seeing the S&amp;L bailout progress
overrides any points Olympic might be able to win.
   ``A ruling that no one in the Office of Thrift Supervision has
authority to act would be an invitation to chaos,'' said Aaron B.
Kahn, a lawyer for the agency.
   He said a decision favoring Olympic would open the floodgates to
scores of similar suits. The government has seized 393 failed S&amp;Ls
in the past year, 131 of them since the Aug. 9 enactment of
President Bush's bailout bill, which Olympic is challenging.
   Lamberth, after listening to more than two hours of oral
arguments, said he would rule by March 21. That is when his March 7
temporary order blocking immediate seizure of Olympic expires.
   The judge did not indicate which way he was leaning. But he said
the public interest issue was the most difficult in the case, which
if decided as Olympic urged, would have a ``tremendous impact.''
   Former Justice Department attorney Charles J. Cooper,
representing Olympic, said, he recognized the far-reaching
implications, but added, ``It's not as wildly devastating as the
(government) would have you think.''
   He argued that the Constitution protects the rights of
individual citizens, or in this case a savings institution, even at
the expense of taxpayers and the public in general.
   In any case, the added expense of delaying the seizure of
Olympic, when compared with the overall cost of the S&amp;L bailout,
``takes something which is a raging inferno and tosses a cigarette
into it,'' Cooper said.
   Olympic is disputing the constitutional authority of acting
thrift office director Salvatore R. Martoche as well as the
director he replaced, M. Danny Wall.
   The new S&amp;L law provided that Wall, who was chairman of the old
Federal Home Loan Bank Board, would inherit the directorship of the
thrift office without being reappointed by the president and
reconfirmed by the Senate.
   However, Cooper said Wall's appointment, in effect, died because
the agency he headed was abolished. He said Martoche's temporary
appointment, after Wall quit earlier this month, would have been
valid had Wall been properly appointed.
   But in this case Martoche is filling a new position, a situation
not covered by the temporary appointments law, Cooper said.
   Olympic, with $1.1 billion in assets, was created in 1982 by the
merger of two weak thrifts. Its home base, Berwyn, is a Chicago
suburb.
   In another case, filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Topeka,
Kan., Franklin Savings Association of Ottawa, Kan., also challenged
Wall's constitutional authority. The government seized Franklin,
with about $9 billion in assets, last month.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   SmithKline Beecham PLC reported Wednesday that its
profit for 1989 declined 65 percent over a year ago due largely to
heavy costs associated with the recent merger of the health,
household products and pharmaceuticals company.
   The company said its net profit totaled $209 million, compared
with $591 million in 1988. Sales, however, rose 14 percent to $7.9
billion from $6.9 billion.
   The full-year results were the first for the company since its
merger in July 1989. Britain's Beecham Group PLC and
Philadelphia-based SmithKline Bechman Corp. merged through an
exchange of shares, creating the world's second-largest
pharmaceuticals company after Rahway, N.J.-based Merck &amp; Co.
   SmithKline Beecham said the year-earlier financial statements
were presented as if the merger had taken place at the beginning of
January 1988.
   The 1989 results included an $805 million restructuring charge
as a result of the combination for closing some of its facilities,
cutting staff and writing down certain assets.
   SnithKline Beecham said it also took a $124 million
extraordinary loss due to merger transaction costs.

   The stock market gained ground today, rebounding
from Tuesday's mild setback.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 12.61 to 2,687.16
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 8 to 7 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 467 up, 406 down and
533 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 21.39 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The market retreated Tuesday as interest rates came under new
upward pressure in the credit markets. But rates levelled off or
declined slightly in early activity today, giving some
encouragement to stock traders.
   Most analysts agree that stocks have benefited lately from hopes
that the economy could emerge from its recent period of weakness
without having to undergo a full-blown recession.
   Brokers say that kind of optimism would be buttressed if
interest rates do not go much higher than their current levels.
   Gainers among the blue chips included General Motors, up \ at
47&rsqb;; DuPont, up \ at 39&lsqb;; International Business Machines, up { at
106}, and Philip Morris, up &lsqb; at 37}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.30 to 185.55. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .41 at 361.20.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 12.16 to

<HEAD>Report Says Japanese Firms to Participate in Boeing 777 Project</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A consortium of three Japanese companies plan to
invest about $825 million in the development of Boeing Co.'s
proposed 777 jet, according to a published report.
   The nationally circulated newspaper Asahi Shimbun reported
Tuesday that the three companies, led by Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries Ltd., will inform Seattle-based Boeing by the end of the
month of their intention to participate in the project.
   The newspaper identified the two other companies as Kawasaki
Heavy Industries Ltd. and Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.
   Officials of the companies were not immediately available
Wednesday to comment on the report.
   Asahi said Boeing had asked the three Japanese firms to
undertake 25 percent of the estimated $3.3 billion development cost
of the project, or about $825 million.
   The Boeing project calls for development of a new jet with a
300- to 350-passenger capacity.
   The Japanese firms plan to ask the Japanese government for
financial assistance if they participate in the project, Asahi said.
   Japan's government already has spent about $46 million since
1986 in a development project involving the three companies and
Boeing of a separate jet, the B7J7, which would have a capacity of
150 passengers, Asahi said.
   The costs and risks of development of new airliners have become
so great that single companies can rarely undertake such projects
alone.

   Two days before President-elect Fernando
Collor de Mello takes office, the nation's banks were ordered
closed to try to stabilize markets in advance of his emergency
economic package.
   Analysts said the three-day bank holiday, announced Tuesday
night, was in response to large-scale withdrawals from banks.
   The Central Bank also announced the cruzado, the national
currency, would be devalued 10.7 percent effective Monday, when
banks reopen.
   By Tuesday evening, lines stretched for blocks at automatic bank
machines in major cities with people trying to get cash for the
next several days. Withdrawals were limited to the equivalent of
$47 per person per day.
   Collor de Mello, Brazil's first directly elected president in
almost 30 years, has promised free-market economic reforms to try
to bring down a 2,700 percent inflation rate. He takes office
Thursday and plans to announce his emergency economic plan to
Congress the next day.
   The three-day bank holiday was decreed by Zelia Cardoso de
Mello, the nation's new economic minister.
   ``The bank holiday was declared to preserve the stability of
markets until the whole package of measures is announced,'' she
said. ``In the past few days, there has been a great deal of
speculative activity and we wanted to calm the market down.''
   Ms. Cardoso de Mello, no relation to the president-elect,
offered no further information about the new economic proposals,
which are expected to include selling off inefficient state
companies, firing thousands of public employees and making huge
spending cuts.
   Newspaper reports in all major dailies said today the economic
measures were expected to include:
   _A wage and price index, which would increase by a set amount
each month, perhaps preceded by a brief wage-and-price freeze.
   _An increase in utility and fuel rates. This was expected to
include a 30 percent jump in electricity prices and a 70 percent
increase for fuel.
   _A new tax on bank profits and corporte earnings.
   _Elimination of the estimated $2.2 billion in government
subsidies, and suspension for one year of all fiscal incentives,
which cost the federal treasury $5.5 billion yearly.
   _A devaluation of the new cruzado by 30 percent, an effort to
make Brazilian exports more competitive.
   _The introduction of a new national currency _ the fourth in as
many years _to replace the new cruzado.
   Investors, uneasy about Collor de Mello's economic plans, have
withdrawn money from short-term deposits to speculate in gold and
the illegal but tolerated black market for dollars, causing wild
swings in their values in recent weeks.
   Brazil's government is operating with a $31 billion deficit and
has a $114 billion foreign debt, the world's largest.
   Business leaders have expressed concern about a possible
wage-and-price freeze, the basis of four failed anti-inflationary
plans by the outgoing administration of Jose Sarney. Both the
president-elect and Ms. Cardoso de Mello have denied they will
implement a freeze.
   The devaluation was much larger than normal. Officials have
devalued the cruzado about 2 percent daily to keep up with
inflation.
   Brazil, with about 150 million people, has been wracked for
years by persistently high inflation that has outpaced wage
increases. An active labor movement has struck frequently for
higher salaries and benefits.
   Of Brazil's 60-million-member work force, the leftist Central
Workers Union and the more moderate General Workers Center claim to
represent close to 35 million workers.
   Foreign delegations began arriving on Wednesday for Collor's
inauguration.
   Cuban President Fidel Castro was among the first to arrive. In
all, 121 countries will be sending delegations and 27 heads of
state o government have said they will attend.

   J&amp;L Specialty Products Corp. has agreed to be

   Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
   J&amp;L, which announced the merger on Tuesday, said it would keep
its Pittsburgh headquarters and Paris-based Ugine would appoint a
new board of directors.
   ``The change in ownership should have no adverse effect on our
employment levels or the continued operation of J&amp;L's steelmaking
and finishing facilities,'' J&amp;L President Claude Kronk said in a
statement.
   J&amp;L was spun off from steel giant LTV Corp. of Dallas in 1986
and purchased by Citicorp Capital Investors. It employs 1,300 and
had sales of $848.7 million for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30.
   Kronk said the deal is expected to be completed June 15, subject
to approval of the board of directors of Citicorp Capital and Ugine
and federal regulators.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were modestly
lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   The declines extended the previous session's losses in response
to improved U.S. crop weather.
   Stormy conditions and unseasonably warm temperatures prevailed
in the eastern half of the country, bringing moisture to the wheat
fields of the Great Plains and the still-unplanted corn and soybean
regions of the Midwest.
   A sharp drop in soybean oil prices, reflecting adequate
supplies, put additional pressure on soybean futures prices.
Soybean oil for March delivery was down 23 cents at $21.68 per
hundredweight in early trading.
   The beginning of the Brazilian soybean harvest, which will bring
new supplies to market, also is weighing on the soybean market.
   In early trading, wheat futures were \ cent to 2{ cents lower
with the contract for delivery in March at $3.78{ a bushel; corn
futures were 1\ cents to 2{ cents lower with March at $2.42{ a

   Livestock and meat futures were narrowly mixed in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle futures were .25 cent lower to .25 cent higher with
April at 78.15 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent lower to

.05 cent lower to .18 cent higher with April at 53 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .30 cent lower to .10 cent higher with

<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first meeting between leaders of the pilots
union at Trans World Airlines Inc. and the company's new chief
operating officer collapsed Tuesday because of a dispute about the
confidentiality of their discussions.
   Kent Scott, chairman of the TWA branch of the Air Line Pilots
Association, said Chief Operating Officer William Hoar unexpectedly
demanded that the union's executive council keep all remarks secret
from the rank and file.
   ``We simply couldn't live with that kind of a gag order,'' Scott
said.
   Although Scott offered to keep some information confidential,
Hoar and two TWA officials who accompanied him decided to leave the
union's headquarters in St. Louis and fly back to New York. TWA has
corporate offices in Mt. Kisco, N.Y.
   Scott said he was puzzled by the turn of events and added that
he did not know what Hoar might have been planning to tell the
union leaders if they granted his request.
   ``He agreed to this six weeks ago and then five minutes before
the meeting he wanted to change the ground rules,'' Scott said.
   Hoar said Monday that he planned to appeal to the pilots for
concessions and to outline specific measures that managers were
taking to strengthen TWA.
   Union leaders invited Hoar to come to St. Louis and discuss the
outlook for TWA when he was appointed chief operating officer in
January.
   Hoar's actions Tuesday should not damage relations between the
pilots union and TWA, Scott said, but they could delay a
presentation to the executive council until June.
   On Monday, the 12 members of the executive council elected Scott
to a two-year term as chairman.
   He had been acting chairman since late August, when his
predecessor, Tom Ashwood, was recalled.
   The council members who voted to oust Ashwood were concerned
that his deteriorating relationship with TWA owner Carl Icahn had
undermined his ability to negotiate with the company.
   But Scott also has taken a relatively hard line in his dealings
with Icahn, criticizing the investor's management of TWA and his
call for further concessions from workers.
   Scott said Monday that the $80 million in concessions that Icahn
is seeking from the pilots would do little to resolve TWA's
problems.
   ``TWA's financial woes in no way relate to the pilots' wages and
working conditions,'' he said. ``They are instead the predictable
result of Icahn's 1988 privatization transaction, which crippled
the company with more than $2.6 billion in debt, much of it through
`junk borrowing,' and simultaneously extracted more than $650
million in cash from the airline.''
   Scott has maintained that Icahn intends to dismantle TWA and is
trying to make it appear as though the pilots are forcing him to
sell assets by refusing to accept concessions.

   Georgia-Pacific said it will reorganize its pulp

some layoffs, and expects to sell some assets this year.
   ``Surely there will be some reductions in force,'' A.D. Correll,
executive vice president of Georgia-Pacific's pulp and paper unit,
said Tuesday.
   Correll said Georgia-Pacific has not determined how many people
will lose their jobs. He said the reductions would be at both
Georgia-Pacific and Great Northern Nekoosa Corp., which
Georgia-Pacific acquired for almost $4 billion earlier this month.
   Correll made the comments after meeting with securities analysts
in New York to discuss the acquisition. The restructuring is
intended to help Georgia-Pacific improve profits as it tries to
reduce debt from the takeover.
   T. Marshall Hahn Jr., Georgia-Pacific's chairman and chief
executive, told the analysts that all businesses, plants and
timberland are being reviewed and that sales of some
``non-strategic assets'' were expected.
   Hahn said the merger of the two companies would save more than
the $80 million annually that Georgia-Pacific had estimated.

<TEXT>
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski called on the American
public today to voice support for his plan to slash the budget
deficit by raising taxes and cutting federal spending.
   ``What the American people have to do is show their reaction to
their representatives,'' the chairman of the tax-writing House Ways
and Means Committee said on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show.
   ``There's a timidity on Capitol Hill that is somewhat
frightening,'' he said. ``You worry about the next election but I
don't think you should be committed to it to the point where you're
going to lose the national interest.''
   Rostenkowski, D-Ill., read one telegram he received that said,
``I'm 83 years old. I don't care if you're an old dog, you have
courage. Go for it, you're doing the right thing.''
   The Bush administration has shown interest in negotiating about
Rostenkowski's plan, but Democratic leaders have shown only
luke-warm support for it.
   Bush, asked today about conflicting signals the White House has
sent on the Rostenkowski plan, told reporters, ``Read all the tea
leaves. Listen to the nuances. It's out there very clearly.'' He
made the comment after touring a power plant in Aquasco, Md.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley says White House interest in
Rostenkowski's proposal is meaningless unless President Bush joins
with the lawmaker and supports a tax increase.
   ``The president is the key and indispensable participant in any
effort to reduce the deficit, and that includes taxes,'' Foley,
D-Wash., said Tuesday. Unless Bush renounces his no-tax pledge,
``Chairman Rostenkowski's proposal cannot be enacted,'' he said.
   Rostenkowski, D-Ill., on Sunday proposed to eliminate federal
deficits by raising federal income and excise taxes, freezing
domestic programs for one year including Social Security benefits,
and cutting defense spending.
   ``We face big problems that can't be solved with nickel-and-dime
solutions,'' Rostenkowski said Tuesday. ``Nothing less than our
childrens' future standards of living are at stake.''
   Bush, meantime, continued his administration's positive reaction
to Rostenkowski's proposal. He called it a bold initiative with
``evident good will and determination to try to break the ice and
move the process forward.''
   But the president also reiterated his opposition to raising
taxes, and steered clear of endorsing any specific element of the
proposal.
   White House budget director Richard Darman, speaking at a news
briefing, emphasized the seriousness with which the administration
was taking the plan, and even hinted there might be new fees beyond
those already in the president's budget which Bush might not
consider tax hikes.
   The comments by administration officials made clear they would
much prefer to negotiate on the budget with Rostenkowski than with
other, more partisan congressional Democrats.
   But Foley said he intended to proceed with the normal budget
process in the House.
   A great deal of the White House response ``had to do with
friendship between Mr. Rostenkowski and the president. That doesn't
speak of any substantive change on the part of the president to
consider new taxes,'' Foley said.
   Other Democratic leaders echoed Foley's sentiments toward Bush.
No one came forward to endorse the deficit plan except as a serious
proposal.
   Congressional Republicans, meantime, took advantage of the
administration ability to keep the Rostenkowski plan in the news by
issuing statements attacking Democrats on its politically toughest
points.
   ``I see this as simply affirmation of the basic Democratic
agenda: raise taxes, continue the growth of Democratic programs and
if necessary cut Social Security to do it,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas.

   It's the Year of the Horse, but the
turtle might be a more fitting symbol for China's economy as it
enters the 1990s with millions of factories shutting down and
workers idled.
   Boomtown China, with its ubiquitous construction cranes and
conspicuous consumption, has given way to a cash-starved economy
pushed to the brink of recession by a government determined to curb
inflation.
   Inflation is falling: retail prices were up about 7 percent by
yearend, about a third of the official inflation rate for the
previous two years.
   But the process of curbing it has brought new problems equally
troubling the government, which showed through its violent
suppression of a pro-democracy movement nearly a year ago that it
values stability above all.
   Unemployment and indebtedness have grown sharply and
productivity has fallen. The 1980s entrepreneurial spirit has
subsided, replaced by renewed emphasis on central planning and
political correctness.
   The government began its attack on inflation in late 1988 by
ordering sharp cuts in construction, official spending and loans.
But the full impact hit in the last quarter of 1989, when
industrial output grew at an annual rate of less than 1 percent,
vs. nearly 21 percent for all of 1988.
   In a series of emergency moves, the government loaned state
companies nearly $27 billion at the end of the year and ordered
factories to recall laid-off workers even if they had nothing to do.
   This month, Premier Li Peng hinted at an early end to the
retrenchment, which was to have lasted three years, when he called
for development to be brought ``back to a reasonable pace.'' More
significant economic shifts may be disclosed at the upcoming
National People's Congress session.
   ``They were running into a recession, but they pulled up at the
last minute,'' said a Western economic analyst, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   She said local governments also cushioned the shock by loaning
money to the worst-hit companies and helping others merge or
restructure.
   ``There seems to be a lot of flexibility in the system to create
safety nets,'' she said.
   But others believe restarting the engine will not be that easy.
   ``Before people were on a roll. They were willing to say, `Let's
do it.' It took 10 years for people to forget,'' that making
decisions could be risky, said a Western diplomat. Now, they've
been reminded, and ``everyone wants to wait for the central
government's say-so.''
   So far, the economic slowdown is less apparent in the shops,
which remain full, than in the warehouses.
   Televisions, refrigerators, electric fans, bicycles, rugs and
dozens of other products in high demand a year ago are piling up in
storehouses as consumers heed the government's call to spend less
and save more.
   The result has been to idle millions of workers making the
no-longer-popular items. In January, China made 40 percent fewer
color TVs than in January 1989 and about half as many cars, washing
machines and refrigerators, state statistics show.
   Government officials say privately that unemployment among urban
workers is 4 percent and growing, but the figure would be much
higher if it includd the millions who spend their days doing
unproductive work _ cleaning workshops, studying political
documents, playing cards.
   Rural authorities have organized tree planting and water
conservancy projects to occupy the millions of peasants sent home
from city construction teams or laid off from tiny rural factories
that were the first casualties of the austerity.
   Workers with jobs also have felt pinched. Wages have failed to
pace even the reduced inflation.
   The Foreign Employment Service Corp. in Shanghai, which supplies
personnel for foreign employers, stopped paying wages for months. A
shoe factory in Shanghai paid its workers in shoes, which they
tried to hawk on the main shopping street.
   Angry workers have sought permission to demonstrate in several
cities, Chinese sources say, and unconfirmed reports describe
actual marches in the northeast, China's heavy-industry heartland.
Authorities deny the reports.
   They acknowledge, however, that many factories are in trouble.
Nationwide, companies owe each other a total of $21 billion because
cash-poor banks won't release funds.
   Yao Fugen, president of the Shanghai No. 1 Sewing Machine
Factory, doesn't ship any machines now unless he's paid first.
Denied credit by banks, he also borrowed more than $3 million from
customers, swapped sewing machines for pig iron and began
test-manufacturing fishing rods as a hedge against the soft sewing
machine market.
   The government says manufacturers who show ingenuity will
survive and inefficient ones will fail, ultimately benefiting the
economy.
   In practice, the survivors are state-owned factories, notorious
for inefficiency, while millions of private, collective and other
non-state factories have closed. Banks refuse them loans, and they
find it harder than ever to get raw materials because the
government has recentralized distribution.
   Authorities are trying to improve productivity at the state
factories by stepping up Marxist education among the workers and
reviving the past art of elevating labor heros.
   But at three large state factories in Shanghai, the industrial
heart of China, Communist Party secretaries said Marxist study was
mainly limited to party members.
   Western analysts agree that action was needed to cool inflation,
but they worry the government will hit the pump again without
correcting any basic problems, such as irrational prices and taxes.
   A Western diplomat predicted, ``They may go through all this
pain with nothing to show for it.''

   A faltering economy and resurgence of
anti-capitalist sentiment are adding to China's already formidible
reputation as a difficult place to invest.
   The government is wooing foreign investment and technology as
fervently as ever, and most analysts agree that China needs and
wants Western help to modernize.
   But its efforts to curb inflation and shortages of key raw
materials have reversed free-market reforms of recent years, once
again miring foreign businessmen in socialist red tape.
   Moreover, the conservative backlash to last year's mass protests
for democratic reform has revived official suspicion and resentment
of foreigners.
   ``There's a faction ... that believes the foreigners have been
getting too good a deal and should be controlled,'' said a Western
lawyer resident in Shanghai, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Another lawyer said Chinese bureaucrats told him they could not
process foreign business quickly because ``they're afraid of being
seen as Zhao Ziyang's running dogs.'' Zhao was ousted in June as
Communist Party chief, blamed for excessive liberalism that helped
spawn the democracy movement.
   Authorities sent one foreign company a letter admonishing it not
to look for profit in China. ``Every penny you make as a foreign
investor (the Chinese) look at as a penny out of their pocket,''
said a Western diplomat.
   Several major American companies say they are thinking of
pulling out. ``We're not here on a welfare basis,'' said one
American manager, who did not want his company named before a
decision is made.
   He said efforts to mend problems with the Chinese partner
reminded him of ``a child trying to keep his parents together when
maybe it's the best thing for them to divorce.''
   Another joint venture's foreign board members voted to dissolve
the venture but the Chinese side refused. A small U.S. family-owned
company simply walked away in frustration from its China joint
venture, not bothering to formally dissolve ties.
   New investment contracts have been signed since June, when the
army attack on student protesters in Beijing chilled
Chinese-foreign relations, but they are down sharply from the
pre-June pace.
   One problem is that government signals are confusing. The
National People's Congress, China's legislature, is expected to
amend the joint venture law to pledge not to nationalize them and
to let foreigners to serve as chairmen.
   Businessmen call these positive moves. But an even more welcome
proposal, to extend the 50-year limit on the life of joint
ventures, faces stiff opposition and is not expected to pass.
   The government also has tightened controls on joint venture
prices, imports and exports and purchases of domestic supplies _
treating them, in the words of one foreign expert, more and more as
if they were state-owned companies.
   Shanghai Volkswagen was still waiting in early March for Beijing
to decide its 1990 production quota and prices. Before last year,
it needed only Shanghai city approval to change prices.
   The new controls are not just from the center of power. Shanghai
approved new regulations last year giving the Communist
Party-controlled unions the right to join in joint ventures'
long-term planning sessions, and to intervene whenever a worker is
disciplined or fired.
   Foreign businesses also have been hurt by last year's dramatic
slowdown in Chinese economic growth, accompanied by a dramatic cut
in bank loans and severe shortage of cash for even normal
transactions.
   ``Our accounts receivable have gone right out the window,'' said
the American manager of a Shanghai joint venture. ``We've sent
teams out collecting. I know of a company that sends two people to
sit in debtors' offices and tells them not to leave until they are
paid.''
   Some joint ventures have borrowed from foreign parent companies
or from union funds, or have mortgaged assets in what amounts to a
hand-to-mouth existence.
   But local authorities, equally desperate for funds, have hit on
the joint ventures like piggy banks.
   Seacliff Limited, for example, a U.S.-Japanese partner in a new
luxury hotel and office complex in Shanghai, has been told that for
every car it imports for the hotel, it will have to donate two cars
to local authorities. The center's general manager, Michael Kalyk,
said the issue is under negotiation.

<DATELINE>WENZHOU, China (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Every year 20-year-old Sun Lili travels
three days by bus and train to a factory near Canton to buy cartons
of brightly colored hair trinkets and plastic jewelry.
   She hauls them back to Wenzhou, a port city midway up the
Chinese coast, and resells them from her own private stall.
   Not many women her age in China have that much spunk, but not
many young women earn 10,000 yuan or more than $2,100 a year either
_ about five times the average worker's wage.
   In Wenzhou, however, Sun is far from extraordinary. Private
business is the city's lifeblood and has been for generations, to
hear residents talk.
   ``Since the Song dynasty Wenzhou has had a commodity economy,''
said Ma Jinlong, referring to the 10th century rulers of China. Ma
is deputy director of the city Systems Restructuring Commission,
another oddity _ not many cities as small and remote as Wenzhou
have think-tanks to encourage private and other non-state
enterprise.
   As a result, while private factories account for less than 5
percent of the nationwide industrial output, in Wenzhou they
produce more than 32 percent. Most of the shops and restaurants are
private, and tens of thousands of Wenzhou residents hit the road
each year as traveling salesmen.
   Wenzhou, 250 miles south of Shanghai, seems to lack the
requirements of a commercial center. It has no airport, although
one is nearing completion, and no rail link.
   Visitors endure a 24-hour ferry ride from Shanghai or 10-hour
drive from Hangzhou, to the northwest.
   ``You've heard of `capitalist tails'?'' asked a visiting
Shanghai woman. That was what the radical leftists during the
1966-76 Cultural Revolution called anything that smacked of
capitalism. ``Well, Wenzhou was a capitalist tail.''
   During the mid-1980s, the city briefly became the tail that
wagged the dog, as top officials and delegates from around China
visited to observe the ``Wenzhou model'' for prosperity _
encouraging household-based small businesses.
   Then-premier and later Communist Party secretary Zhao Ziyang, a
leading proponent of market reforms, visited in 1985. But Zhao was
ousted last June, accused of embracing dangerous liberalism.
   His successor as party chief, Jiang Zemin, has made a point of
visiting major state factories and revolutionary war bases.
   With the dual aim of curbing inflation and reviving Marxist
spirit, the central government has cut off loans and supplies to
non-state enterprises. It also has ordered deep cuts in spending
and construction, pushing the national economy almost into
recession.
   Wenzhou again is under a shadow. Authorities have begun policing
its private businessmen more closely for tax evasion and smuggling,
and some have been arrested or forced to close.
   Late last year, a Wenzhou man who ran a private credit union was
executed. He apparently misused funds to build and furnish his
home, but official reports of the case broadly criticized all
private credit unions as ``speculative undertakings meant for
reaping windfall profits.''
   Yang Jiaxing, chairman of Wenzhou's Lucheng City Credit
Cooperative, gets a frustrated look when he talks about profits.
   His credit union, founded in 1986 as China's first private
banking operation, earned 1.3 million yuan or about $276,000 last
year. But after taxes, it had $15,300 left to distribute among
shareholders.
   ``We originally thought we'd make more,'' Yang said. But the
number and size of taxes keep growing _ three more were added last
year.
   Some Wenzhou residents have adjusted to the change. Others have
shut down to wait for bitter times. More than half a million
traveling salesmen have come home because of poor business, Ma said.
   But Wenzhou's private business sector has by no means folded.
   Hundreds of open-front family shops still line the narrow
streets, their displays of shoes, stylish clothes, leather belts,
buttons and toys pushing onto the sidewalks.
   A steady steam of tiny Polish-made Fiats navigate the streets
with tinny horns beeping, most with private businessmen at the
wheel.
   At night, noisy parties set off firecrackers outside a popular
private restaurant, its sidewalk jammed with the motorcycles of
well-off diners.
   ``They're too small and there's too many of them for the
government to shut down,'' said one young woman.
   Private businessmen have little overhead, and many have enough
savings to weather a few bad years, as long as they're not hounded
and harassed out of existence.
   Sun Lili, too young to remember the Cultural Revolution, said
she's not worried.
   ``I'm not selling anything bad,'' she said, fingering a
velvet-covered headband.

   Faint murmurs rise from the floor. A
voice intones, ``Now start trading.''
   Figures flash on an electronic board: U.S. Dollars are selling
for 5.91 yuan, the previous day's closing price and 1.2 yuan over
the official exchange rate.
   Sellers are hawking $5.4 million and buyers want $5.3 million. A
bank trims its sales offer, and the figures match. The price stays
unchanged.
   It took two minutes. Within an hour, all the transactions have
been processed and the clients have left the Shanghai currency
exchange.
   Market employees relax with a noisy game of pingpong on a table
in front of the big board, housed in an imposing former bank from
the pre-Communist days when Shanghai was an Asian financial center.
   ``Our market is elementary, one could even say primitive,'' said
Qiu Jirong, a young worker at the Shanghai Foreign Exchange
Transaction Center.
   Nonetheless, it is the most sophisticated tool China has for
matching up Chinese and foreign companies that need dollars with
those that have dollars and need the local currency, renminbi. A
yuan is the basic unit of renminbi.
   The renminbi, like most socialist countries' currencies, is not
convertible on world markets, and Chinese banks hoard hard
currencies because they are needed to buy foreign goods. Before
China opened its first currency exchange markets in 1986, most
foreign companies that earned renminbi on investments had no way to
repatriate their profits.
   Shanghai's market is a model of what Chinese leaders hope to do
generally as they reform the economy: borrow Western tools but keep
socialist principles of central control. The center uses price as a
balancing tool, but has little else in common with Western
financial markets.
   Playing the market for profit is not allowed. Prices are set in
isolation from world markets, and even from markets in other cities
in China.
   Still, it's come a long way since 1986. Then, businessmen had to
find their own partners to buy or sell currency. The center was
just a place to register the deal, and prices varied widely.
   The currency exchange markets in other cities still stick to
this model, but in 1988 Shanghai advanced to a more systematic and
auction-like way of trading. Four mornings a week, banks and
companies that are registered as members bring their buy and sell
orders to the center.
   The center tallies them up. When dollar supply exceeds demand,
it lowers the price of a dollar by one fen _ one-hundreth of a yuan
_ every two minutes until some sellers withdraw or buyers enter.
   When demand for dollars exceeds supply, the price is raised. The
price is fixed when buy and sell offers balance, and all trades are
made at the same price.
   ``Now it's more fair,'' said the center's deputy manager, Wang
Deshun, a thin, talkative man who once worked for China's central
bank. ``Information is open, and everyone can watch the movement of
prices and decide whether to enter the market or not.''
   That's the theory. In practice, the government tightly controls
who can trade and for what purposes. New regulations _ such as a
ban on importing luxury cars _ directly affect dollar demand and
therefore the exchange rate.
   The center also can reject traders if the gap between supply and
demand is too large, or the central bank can step in and make up
the difference. Wang said it has done so about 10 times.
   Historically, dollars have gone from a high of 7.8 renminbi in
September 1988, when import spending was freer, to a low of 4.98,
reached last November when the government's tight loan policy
forced many companies to sell dollar reserves.
   ``We have to consider the interests of buyers and sellers,''
Wang said. ``If the price (for dollars) goes too high, many
companies won't be able to buy dollars they need. And if it falls
too sharply, then...sellers won't be able to pay their debts.''
   Because the center invariably devalues the renminbi from the
official exchange rate, economists say it at least achieves a rate
closer to the real buying power of the two currencies. For years,
China has kept its renminbi artificially high.
   But some foreign businessmen say all the controls just make the
center rate a second official rate, set to serve the interests of
state trade companies. They are the main dollar sellers and benefit
from the center's high dollar price, while foreign joint ventures
buy dollars to repatriate profits or import parts.
   ``It dilutes our profits. All we want is for them to let us
exchange our renminbi at the official rate,'' said the disgruntled
American manager of one joint venture factory, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Like some other joint ventures, he tried another way of getting
dollars _ by buying a Chinese product to sell abroad. He made his
purchase and lined up a Hong Kong buyer. Then the buyer disappeared.
   Now he has several tons of frozen Chinese jelly fish sitting in
a warehouse. He's back to the currency market.

   Volkswagen's joint venture autoworks in
Shanghai produced nearly 16,000 cars last year _ the equivalent of
four days output for the headquarters factory in West Germany.
   Still, Volkswagen has big plans for the Shanghai factory _ if
China will just release the brakes and put it in gear.
   When Volkswagen AG signed a 50-50 joint venture contract with
the Shanghai Tractor and Automobile Corp. in 1984, it seemed a
perfect fit.
   Volkswagen wanted a manufacturing base to win a share of the
Chinese and Southeast Asian auto market. China, spending tens of
millions of dollars annually to import Japanese cars, wanted to
modernize its auto industry.
   Shanghai Volkswagen started with a capacity of about 100 cars
per day, or 30,000 a year, then doubled capacity last year. But the
most China has ever let it produce in one year is the 15,687 cars
that rolled off the line in 1989.
   The problem is politics. While Chinese auto officials were
approving Volkswagen's expansion and devising plans for three more
joint venture autoworks over the next decade, top Communist leaders
decided cars were a luxury.
   Last summer they banned practically all new car purchases,
domestic and imported alike, by government units and state-owned
companies. The slogan ``hard work and plain living'' was promoted
to curb inflation blamed on ousted Communist Party leader Zhao
Ziyang.
   Thousands of car orders were scrapped. Stocks grew. Shanghai
Volkswagen finally halted production for 39 days, when its
distributor complained it had nowhere to put more cars. The French
automaker Peugeot's joint venture in Canton shut for two months.
   ``Auto industry careens toward a dead end,'' read a headline in
the official China Daily at year's end.
   The crisis eased when the government intervened and bought the
excess inventory _ 7,440 cars from five Chinese or joint venture
factories, at a total cost of $269 million. Wang Rongjun,
Volkswagen's managing director, said he believes most of the cars
are still in government warehouses.
   By early March, Beijing still had not told Shanghai Volkswagen
its production quota for 1990 or responded to a request for a price
increase to offset last year's devaluation that makes imported
parts more expensive. The top West German manager, Burkhard
Welkener, said he expects the quota will be 17,000.
   Wang said Beijing has quietly relaxed its ban on car purchases,
to allow replacement of old cars. But purchases still must be
approved by local authorities, a long and difficult process.
Moreover, the government markup in taxes and other fees is 126
percent, discouraging many potential buyers.
   Fees inclusive, the Shanghai plant's manual transmission Santana
_ a model that once sold in the United States as the Quantum _ goes
for 179,700 yuan, or roughly $38,230. Some provinces add more fees
so the price exceeds $42,550.
   Welkener said per-car production costs could be cut 30 percent
to 40 percent if the factory were allowed to produce at full
capacity. As it is, the Shanghai Santana is too expensive to export
competitively to Southeast Asia.
   But Welkener, a tall, mild-mannered man, seems philosophical
about the government controls.
   ``Of course it is a little bit frustrating to produce only
17,000,'' he said. ``But our company follows the idea of (Chinese
officials) that there has to be a readjustment. We totally agree
that everything has to be slower.''
   He said the factory still plans to send young Chinese engineers
to West Germany for technical training, and bring them back to
design a new Santana for export.
   ``Santana for me is not just a car. Santana is a philosophy to
bring China modern management,'' he said. He used one of the few
Chinese phrases he knows: ``We must do it yibu, yi bude -- step by
step.''

   The stock market was mixed today, bogged down in
uncertainty after Tuesday's mild setback.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 12.16 points on
Tuesday, rose 1.80 to 2,676.35 by noontime on Wall Street.
   But losers slightly outnumbered gainers in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 588 up, 636 down and
565 unchanged.
   The market retreated Tuesday as interest rates came under new
upward pressure in the credit markets. Rates levelled off or
declined slightly in early activity today, giving some
encouragement to stock traders.
   Most analysts agree that stocks have benefited lately from hopes
that the economy could emerge from its recent period of weakness
without having to undergo a full-blown recession.
   Brokers say that kind of optimism would be buttressed if
interest rates do not go much higher than their current levels.
   Worries persist, however, that borrowing costs in this country
would keep increasing if rates climb further in such other
prominent industrialized nations as Japan and West Germany.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Exxon, up | at 46\;
American Express, up &lsqb; at 28; Philip Morris, up \ at 37~, and
Procter &amp; Gamble, up 1&lsqb; at 65\.
   Procter &amp; Gamble has acquired the U.S. marketing rights to Rorer
Group's over-the-counter pharmaceutical products, including the
antacid Maalox.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped .28 to 184.97. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .02 at 360.81.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 67.24 million shares at

debts, has been replaced as head of its truck-trailer operation.
   Combs was replaced Tuesday as Fruehauf Trailer Corp.'s chief
executive by Terex Corp. President Woodward Baldus, officials said.
   Green Bay, Wis.-based Terex bought Fruehauf's trailer business
last August as Fruehauf assets were sold off to meet debts from a
$1.5-billion leveraged buyout by management.
   Fruehauf Trailer Corp. continues as a Terex subsidiary. Combs
went to Terex with the trailer business.
   Combs could not be reached for comment Wednesday at Fruehauf or
at his home. ``Combs was asked to resign,'' Terex spokesman Jeff
Zilka said, but declined further comment.
   The last of the former Fruehauf's assets, Kelsey-Hayes Co.,
maker of auto parts such as aluminum wheels and anti-lock braking
systems, was sold to Canada's Varity Corp. last November.
   Fruehauf Trailer employs about 5,100 people in its U.S.
operations.

<HEAD>WPPSS Plans Third Nuclear Power Bond Refinancing in Seven Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Washington Public Power Supply System plans
to sell bonds in the public market to refinance $600 million in
debt, its third such move in seven months.
   Sale of bonds at 7 percent to 8 percent interest rates, compared
with 12 percent to 15 percent now being paid, should be completed
over the next four weeks, WPPSS officials said.
   Unlike $2.25 billion in bonds on which WPPSS defaulted in 1983,
the debt being refinanced is guaranteed by the Bonneville Power
Administration, which estimates the lower interest payments will
save ratepayers about $75 million this year.
   John Britton of WPPSS said an interest rate for the bonds would
be set by the underwriter this week, with the consortium's board of
directors to vote on the plan Thursday.
   The bonds being refinanced cover work on WPPSS nuclear projects
Nos. 1, 2 and 3. Work on Nos. 1 and 3 was halted indefinitely in
the early 1980s, while No. 2 has been completed and is generating
electricity.
   Two earlier WPPSS refinancings covered bonds for project Nos. 1
and 3.
   The 1983 default was on bonds for WPPSS projects Nos. 4 and 5,
which were terminated when they were roughly two-thirds built.

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gasoline pumps ran dry in Rome and most southern
Italian cities Wednesday as striking truckers set up blockades in
front of supply centers at major oil companies.
   Nearly half of Italy's 200,000 truckers went on strike Monday to
protest a proposed law they contend denies trucking businesses
sufficient tax breaks. The strike is scheduled to last until Monday.
   The strikers on Tuesday began pressing their demands by using
trucks to block deliveries of gasoline to stations by non-striking
truckers.
   Worried car drivers lined up in front of the rapidly decreasing
number of operating pumps as word of the fuel shortage spread.
   Roberta Della Casa, a spokewoman for the ESSO Italiana oil
company, said the situation was better in northern Italy, where a
lower percentage of truckers had joined the strike.
   Transportation Minister Carlo Bernini met with police and
ministry officials Tuesday and said later that authorities would
enforce anti-picketing measures to free the flow of gasoline.
   However, Ms. Della Cassa said that supply centers were still
blocked Wednesday by striking truckers.

<HEAD>Nostalgia Channel Hires Program Syndicator as Exclusive Ad Sales
Rep</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nostalgia Channel, a cable network aimed at
viewers age 45 and older, said Wednesday it has signed a five-year
exclusive agreement to have the syndication company LBS
Communications Inc. sell its advertising time.
   Officials said the agreement was the first such arrangement
between a television syndicator and a basic cable network.
   The network owners said the agreement should help the channel
grow by giving it readier access to national advertisers than if it
were to assemble its own sales force to solicit them.
   To date, the 5-year-old network has sold advertising time mainly
to direct marketers, who display a product and urge viewers to call
in with orders, but has made no concerted effort to sell time to
traditional national advertisers.
   Founded in 1976, LBS has specialized in identifying target
audiences, helping develop programs that will appeal to them and
selling advertising time.
   Among the syndicated TV shows in which it sells time are Family
Feud and The Real Ghostbusters. It also sells time in the
syndicated radio show Flashback that features music and interviews
from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.
   This fall, LBS will handle advertising sales for the syndicated
TV show that the National Broadcasting Co. and Memories: Then and
Now magazine are putting together based on the magazine.
   Henry Siegel, chairman and president of LBS, said the agreement
with The Nostalgia Channel means LBS will be able to create an
advertising package through media all aimed at the over-45 market _
including time on broadcast, cable TV and radio as well as space in
a magazine.
   The Nostalgia Channel is carried on 450 cable systems with more
than 8.5 million subscribers nationwide. Another 2 million homes
receive the channel via satellite dishes.
   The network provides a variety of programming aimed at the
over-45 audience, including classic movies, vintage TV series such
as Burke's Law, Dick Powell Theater and The Rogues, and shows
featuring big bands or Liberace.
   It also offers news, financial advice and travel programs geared
toward the over-45 audience, gardening and home improvement shows,
and Jack LaLanne exercise programs.

<TEXT>
   A National Research Council panel today called
for billions more in government spending on child care, mandatory
one-year leaves for parents of newborns and a program to establish
strict national standards for day care-centers.
   ``Every American child not only deserves quality care, the
future vitality of our nation depends on it,'' said John L. Palmer,
chairman of the committee that produced the report, ``Who Cares for
America's Children?''
   The report said that by the year 2000 about three out of every
four American children will have mothers in the work force and that
even now the majority of American parents entrust care of their
young children to others.
   Palmer, a professor at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and
Public Affairs at Syracuse University, said the committee found
``substantial scientific evidence'' that good quality child care
can have serious effects on the future life of every child and the
influence that child has in society.
   Committee member Barbara Bowman of the Erikson Institute in
Chicago said there is no good research to reflect how many of the
thousands of child care arrangements in this country meet the
minimum standards of quality.
   She said limited research showed that only about 20 percent of
care arrangements ``meet the standards of good or better.''
   Ms. Bowman said that more than half of all children of working
parents are cared for in facilities that are unregulated, and as a
result, national data on the specifics of quality child care are
lacking.
   The report spelled out a future in child care in which virtually
a whole generation will be cared for by persons other than parents.
   The report said that in 1988, more than 10.5 million children
under age 6 had mothers in the labor force. Another 18 million
between the ages 6 and 13 had working mothers, it said.
   Within five years, the study said, about two-thirds of all new
workers will be women and 80 percent of them are expected to have
children at some point during their careers.
   Forecasts suggest that by the year 2000 about 80 percent of
school-age children and 70 percent of preschool children will have
mothers who are working or looking for work outside their homes, it
said.
   The report said that by 1995 the amount spent annually for child
care in the United States will reach $48 billion. But to provide
``adequate care'' for all children under age 13, it said total
costs for parents and the government could rise eventually to about
$126 billion.
   Child care expenses absorb an average of 23 percent of the
income of poor families, the report said. It noted, however, that
one study shows that for families earning under $5,000 a year, the
child care expense can represent up to 50 percent of the income.
Higher income families pay about 9 percent of their income for
child care.
   The quality of child care facilities varies from state to state,
community to community, and is affected by the parents' income
level, the panel said.
   Enforcement of day care quality ranges from none in some states
that lack license requirements or state inspections, to other
states with mandatory standards that are strictly enforced, it said.
   Child care center employees are almost universally poorly paid
and worker turnover is very high, it said.
   The panel said studies show there is an important need for
parents to establish strong relationships with their children in
the early months of life. As a result, it said, the federal
government ``should mandate unpaid, job-protected leave for
employed parents of infants up to one year of age.''
   Among large companies, about 47 percent provide some form of
paid maternity leave, but only 10 percent of the companies with
fewer than 100 employees had such a policy, the report said.
   Five states _ California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York and Rhode
Island _ and Puerto Rico include wage and position protection in
pregnancy disability leave programs. In New Jersey, for example,
workers are entitled to 26 weeks' leave and up to $200 a week in
compensation.
   Other recommendations:
   _The federal government and the states should increase subsidies
to low-income families for quality child care programs. The added
costs, either through taxincentives or grants, the report said,
could be as high as $10 billion.
   _Establish a uniform national standard for child care. This
could include minimum safety and health standards, along with
acceptable ranges for staff-to-child ratios, group size, caregiver
qualifications and physical space in the facility.
   _Expand Head Start and other preschool programs for children of
poor families.
   _Strengthen ``the infrastructure of the child care system'' by
improving wages and training for caregivers, expanding voucher
programs to give poor families more opportunities to choose
centers, and encouraging organization of family day care systems.
   The National Research Council is an organization of the National
Academy of Sciences, a private society of scholars chartered by
Congress with a mandate to advise the federal government on
scientific and technical matters.

<HEAD>European Parliament Votes for Total Ban on Tobacco Ads</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STRASBOURG, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Parliament voted
Wednesday for a total ban on tobacco advertising throughout the 12
nation European Community.
   But the ban will not take effect because the European
Community's Executive Commission refused to accept the Parliament's
addition of the ban to proposed legislation to regulate tobacco
advertising.
   The Parliament had added the tobacco advertising ban as an
amendment to legislation proposed by the executive commission that
would allow advertisers to show only the tobacco package and
nicotine and tar yields in ads.
   Under EC law, parliamentary amendments must be approved by the
commission before they can be adopted on a majority vote by the EC
governments. If the commission fails to approve the amendments,
they can only be adopted on a unanimous vote by the EC governments.
   A unanimous vote to ban tobacco advertising is highly unlikely
because at least two members, West Germany and Britain, oppose such
a ban.
   However, Vasso Papandreou, the EC commissioner for social
affairs, said she would introduce new proposals after 1992 to ban
tobacco advertising.
   The current proposal should go into force at the end of 1991.
   Under the legislation proposed by the commission, every tobacco
advertisement would be required to carry a health warning covering
at least 10 percent of the advertising space and more if the
warning were in more than one language.
   In addition, tobacco advertisements in magazines aimed at those
under 18 years old would be prohibited and indirect advertising
such as putting tobacco brands or symbols on non-tobacco products
would also be banned.

<HEAD>British Airways Adds Fourth Class</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Airways PLC has introduced a fourth class
for airline passengers.
   A British Airways spokeswoman said Wednesday the initial
response to Economy Select, available on flights between London and
Dallas or Houston, has been ``very positive.''
   Economy Select, for passengers paying the full economy fare, has
a separate cabin, separate check-in, advance seat reservations and
seats that recline 3 inches more than those in regular economy
class, the airline said.
   The eight-month trial program began Feb. 1 after extensive
research, said the spokeswoman, who declined to be identified by
name in accordance with British custom. British Airways is the
first airline to introduce a fourth class, she added.
   ``Today, companies send their executives on full economy fares,
which cost more than promotional fares but which have the full
flexibility they need for business,'' said Liam Strong, British
Airways' marketing director.
   ``The expectations of passengers who pay 794 pounds ($1,290) for
a round- trip ticket to Dallas ... will obviously differ from those
of leisure passengers traveling on these routes for as little as
299 pounds ($484) round trip,'' Strong said.
   British Airways' business class fare between London and Dallas
or Houston is 2,122 pounds round trip, or $3,435.
   Stephen Clapham, an airline industry analyst at brokerage Hoare
Govett, said it remains to be seen if the new fourth class will be
a success.
   ``If they (British Airways) were sure of a big demand they would
have introduced it across the board,'' he said.
   Pan Am spokesman Steve Heckscher said the fourth class
experiment bears watching.
   ``Maybe there is a niche that everybody else has missed, but I'm
a little skeptical that it really has a place in the range of
tickets available today,'' he said.
   ``Most companies will let you fly with a business (class) ticket
so there's no reason to buy an economy ticket. Business seats are
more comfortable, there's a little more status and there's added
flexibility with cancellations and re-booking,'' Heckscher said.
   Continental Airlines spokesman Steve Preston did not rule out
the possibility of a fourth class for that carrier.
   ``We are looking at totally restructuring our business class and
totally revamping our front-end products,'' he said, referring to
first class and business class. ``A number of things are under
review at the moment.''
   An American Airlines spokeswoman said the largest U.S. carrier
does not see an immediate need for a fourth class, but added, ``We
are always looking to see what the industry is doing and if it
seems the consumers are interested we might consider it.''
   British Airways' fourth class is limited to 31 non-smoking seats
between the business class and economy class sections on flights
from Gatwick Airport outside London to Dallas and Houston.

<BYLINE>OPEC Ministers Hold Talks; Will They Tamper With Winning Formula?
^By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC oil ministers will gather this
week to discuss the world oil market but are unlikely to tamper
with a formula that has brought them higher-than-expected prices.
   ``There will be talks about the future, but no decisions,''
predicted Pierre Terzian, editor of the Paris-based newsletter
Petrostrategies.
   Peter Gignoux, director of the international energy department
for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in London, expects little from the
meeting. ``They're going to come and go,'' he said.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' monitoring
committee will begin meeting Friday in Vienna. Talks are expected
to center on the group's pricing strategy and current production
levels. Although only eight oil members comprise the panel, all 13
OPEC ministers are expected to attend.
   The discussions will be the first since the cartel met last
November and set a crude oil production ceiling of 22 million
barrels a day for the first six months of 1990. The previous
ceiling was 20.5 million barrels for the final quarter of 1989.
   Analysts estimate that OPEC countries, spurred by persistent
cheaters Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, have been producing
at least a million barrels a day above their cap.
   Even so, prices have remained above OPEC's benchmark of $18 a
barrel, reflecting strong demand by the United States and other
consuming nations.
   Between November and February, OPEC's basket of seven crudes has
averaged more than $19 a barrel. Prices appear to have softened
slightly in March but remain above the target price, averaging
$18.45 in the first week of the month.
   West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark American grade of sweet
crude, is currently priced in the $20 to $21 range, down from $22
to $23 in January.
   Analysts say prices could ease further in the second quarter
when demand for oil declines with the onset of warm weather.
   Nick Antill, analyst at the London-based County NatWest,
forecasts demand for OPEC oil will run about 22 million barrels a
day in the April-June quarter, below current production of 23.2
million barrels estimated by the International Energy Agency.
   Nonetheless, a flurry of reports in advance of the meeting
suggests that the two main items likely to garner the most
attention will be prices and quotas.
   Iraq's Oil Minister Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi was reported
to be pressing privately for a higher target price but was unable
to muster support from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia for such a change.
   Kuwait, with little support, is said to be advocating a rise in
the production ceiling to keep prices in check. Some analysts
believe Kuwait wants to keep prices at $18 to encourage sales and
discourage non-OPEC countries, attracted by higher prices, from
taking away some of the cartel's market share.
   Kuwait's Oil minister Ali Khalifa al-Sabah reportedly has said
Kuwait does not feel bound by its quota when prices remain above
$18 a barrel.
   Al-Sabah also was quoted in the Middle East Economic Survey as
calling for OPEC to abandon the quota system as soon as possible.
He is reported to have said the system is outdated and often
ignored by members.
   The cartel sets an overall production ceiling for its members
and then slices the total into individual allotments for each
producer.
   With little pressure to change a formula that for now is
working, ministers are likely simply to air their views and leave
decisions for the full conference of ministers in May.
   OPEC Secretary-General Subroto has said no decisions are likely
at this week's meeting and that the discussions would provide
``important input'' for the May conference, according to the
organization's news agency OPECNA.
   OPEC members are: Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,
Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.

   Sotheby's Holdings Inc. said Wednesday its
earnings for 1989 climbed 82 percent from a year earlier, while
another fine arts auction house, Christies International PLC,
reported a 61 percent earnings increase.
   Sotheby's, which announced its earnings in New York, said its
net income came to $113 million, or $1.96 a share, in 1989 compared
with $62 million, or $1.10 a share, in 1988.
   Sotheby's said its revenue rose 40 percent to $445 million from
$317 million in 1988.
   For the fourth quarter, net income increased 94 percent to $62
million, or $1.07 a share, from $32 million, or 56 cents a share, a
year earlier.
   Fourth-quarter revenue rose 48 percent to $200 million from $135
million.
   Michael Ainslie, Sotheby's president, said in a statement that
the results showed ``we have further strengthened our leadership
postion in the international art market.''
   Sotheby's auction sales rose 62 percent to $2.95 billion for the
year and 76 percent to $1.49 billion for the quarter.
   Christies said in London that its net profit for the year came
to 40 million pounds, or $64 million, compared with 24.8 million
pounds in 1988. Earnings per share came to 23.4 pence, or 38 cents,
compared with 14.8 pence.
   Christies said its pre-tax profit rose 57 percent to 66.9
million pounds, or $108 million, from 42.5 million pounds.
   Sales soared 71 percent to 1.33 billion pounds, or $2.1 billion,
from 777 million pounds in 1988.
   Christies Chairman Lord Carrington said sales in 1990 are ahead
of a year ago. Growth in the breadth of interest in art, he said,
allows the company to ``look forward to the 1990s with optimism.''
   Christies didn't break out quarterly or six month results. It
isn't required to under British law.

<HEAD>Microsoft Declares 1-for-1 Stock Dividend</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Microsoft Corp., a computer software developer,
has declared a 100 percent stock dividend that amounts to a
one-for-one stock split.
   Microsoft said Tuesday the new stock would be issued to
shareholders of record March 26, doubling the number of shares
outstanding to about 112 million.
   Microsoft stock closed Tuesday at $106.25, down $2 in
over-the-counter trading.
   Raymond B. Ferguson, Microsoft's director of administration,
said it was the second dividend the company has declared since it
went public in March 1986. The first, also a 100 percent stock
dividend, was issued in September 1987.
   ``It's not common to have a cash dividend in our industry,''
Ferguson said. ``There is a greater requirement for cash to
continue to grow the business.''
   Microsoft President Jon Shirley said the dividend was declared
to make the stock more attractive to a broader range of investors.
   Scott McAdams, an analyst with Ragan and MacKenzie Inc. in
Seattle, said making the stock more affordable also could boost the
value of current stock holdings in the long run.
   ``The market tends to like nominally priced stocks,'' McAdams
said.
   When prices get too high, he said, ``there's a little bit of a
psychological edge operating there that may keep the value of the
stock down a little bit.''
   Microsoft reported a profit of $74 million, or $1.25 a share, on
revenue of $300 million for the three months ended Dec. 31,
compared with profit of $47 million, or 85 cents a share, on
revenue of $210 million for the same period a year earlier.

   Entertainment colossus MCA Inc. today bought
the last big independent music label, Geffen Records, the home of
such strong rock acts as Guns N' Roses, Don Henley, Cher, Aerosmith
and Whitesnake.
   Geffen's sole owner, David Geffen, will receive MCA preferred
stock worth about $550 million at today's share price. He may sell
it only over a four-year period, and thus will benefit if its price
goes up and suffer if it falls.
   He will stay on as chairman and chief executive of Geffen, which
he founded a decade ago in a deal in which Warner Bros. Records
distributed his recordings in return for half the profits. That
deal expires at the end of the year.
   Geffen had been negotiating with Warner, the British Thorn-EMI
and other companies. Geffen Records did about $225 million in
business last year.
   Asked why Geffen selected MCA, MCA President Sid Sheinberg said,
``I would suspect that the difference here is that he's dealing
with people he's known for many years, people with a broad basis in
entertainment, not just music.
   Sheinberg noted that Geffen is known as a brilliant businessman.
   ``I'm flattering myself, but I think he also felt this was a
very good security to own,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   In addition to Geffen's music business, his Geffen Films has
produced movies such as ``Beetlejuice,'' ``Little Shop of Horrors''
and ``Risky Business. Geffen Theatre co-produced ``M. Butterfly,''
which earned nine 1988 Tony Awards, ``Cats,'' ``Dreamgirls'' and
``Little Shop of Horrors.''
   MCA is not buying those businesses. But the Universal City-based
giant will acquire rights to Geffen's related music publishing
business, founded in 1987 as a vehicle for Geffen Records-related
projects. It has since expanded and its stable of songwriters now
includes Stephen Sondheim.
   As part of the deal, Geffen signed a 20-year ``standstill''
agreement that bars him from acquiring more MCA stock or engaging
in proxy wars.
   West Hollywood-based Geffen Records' artists also include Tesla,
Peter Gabriel, Edie Brickell and the New Bohemians, Rickie Lee
Jones, Pat Metheny, Joni Mitchell, Robbie Robertson, Jimmy Page,
Olivia Newton-John, Kitaro, Ric Ocasek, XTC, Christopher Williams
and Kylie Minogue.
   MCA, unlike other major labels, does not distribute its own
records overseas. Its foreign distribution agreement with Warner
Bros. runs out in March 1991, and Sheinberg said, ``Where we go
from here in the foreign area remains to be determined.''
   He acknowledged, however, that MCA's roster of country and black
artists is far stronger than its list of rock acts.
   ``Having Geffen certainly gives us a stronger package'' while
negotiating, he said.
   Geffen's salary wasn't revealed. The preferred stock he was
issued is the equivalent of 10 million shares of MCA common stock.
Each share paid a dividend of 68 cents last year.
   Geffen, who got his start as a talent agent, was 27 in 1971 when
he founded Asylum Records, the home of Joni Mitchell, the Eagles
and Jackson Browne. Within two years he sold Asylum to Warner
Communications, becoming chairman of Warner's resulting
Elektra-Asylum label.

   The stock market showed no clear trend today,
bogged down in uncertainty after Tuesday's mild setback.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 12.16 points on
Tuesday, rose 9.68 to 2,684.23 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   But losers slightly outnumbered gainers in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 648 up, 693 down and
539 unchanged.
   The market retreated Tuesday as interest rates came under new
upward pressure in the credit markets. Rates levelled off or
declined slightly in early activity today, giving some
encouragement to stock traders.
   Most analysts agree that stocks have benefited lately from hopes
that the economy could emerge from its recent period of weakness
without having to undergo a full-blown recession.
   Brokers say that kind of optimism would be buttressed if
interest rates do not go much higher than their current levels.
   Worries persist, however, that borrowing costs in this country
would keep increasing if rates climb further in such other
prominent industrialized nations as Japan and West Germany.

   The U.S. dollar weakened in slow European trading
Wednesday but dealers said technical movements were behind the fall.
   Gold prices rose by as much as $3 an ounce.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar fell as traders took
profits from the currency's high position Tuesday and strong levels
over the past two weeks. The British pound gained largely because
of the weaker dollar, they said. The pound is expected to remain
under pressure because of political difficulties for the
Conservative government and anxieties about inflation and taxes.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6090 late Wednesday, more
expensive than Tuesday's $1.6005.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 152.20 Japanese yen, down
from 152.67. In London late Wednesday the dollar closed higher at
152.22 yen.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday:
1.7131 West German marks, down from 1.7165; 1.5255 Swiss francs,
down from 1.5275; 5.7877 French francs, down from 5.7915; 1.9290

   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $399.05 a troy ounce,
up from $396.00 late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold closed at $399.25, up
from $396.00 Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $398.75 bid, up from

<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States on Wednesday unveiled a proposal
to drastically reduce or eliminate import tariffs as its
contribution to an ambitious international trade-liberalizing
agreement planned for the end of the year.
   U.S. deputy trade representative Rufus Yerxa said the offer was
contingent on the United States receiving corresponding concessions
from its trading partners in the 96-nation General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
   In an 800-page document, to be submitted to GATT members on
Thursday, the United States proposes the elimination of tariffs on
imported agricultural products.
   For a second group of goods including wood products and paper,
steel, aluminum, certain chemical products and selected
construction equipment, it proposes duty-free access to U.S.
markets provided trading partners remove tariffs and all trade
barriers from matching U.S. exports.
   For all other products, the U.S. proposal allows for tariff
reductions up to a maximum of 50 percent, again subject to
reciprocal concessions by other countries after bilateral talks.
   This third category includes the sensitive U.S. textiles sector,
traditionally protected by high import tariffs.
   Yerxa told a press conference that cuts in textile duties were
unlikely to reach the 50 percent ceiling, although this was
``theoretically'' possible under the U.S. plan.
   ``Textiles is a very tough category for us to make concessions
on,'' he said.
   Despite high import duties in sectors such as textiles, clothing
and footwear, the United States has a low overall level of tariffs.
A tariff, or tax levied on imported goods, is one of the main ways
of shielding domestic industry from foreign competition because it
makes imported goods more expensive and therefore less competitive
than domestic products.
   Yerxa said U.S. import duty levels averages 6.6 percent for
agricultural products and 5 percent for industrial goods, in
contrast to much higher protection in other countries.
   In Brazil, for example, tariffs average 47 percent of the value
of traded goods, according to figures listed in the U.S. document.
In India the average is 99 percent, and in Pakistan 106 percent.
   ``It would be a great travesty for the United States to have to
reduce its already low tariffs if others don't make reductions,''
Yerxa said.
   At a meeting in Montreal in December 1988 trade ministers agreed
on the overall target of 33 percent for tariff cuts.
   A deal reached in January allowed GATT members to select their
own method of achieving this target. Proposals have to be submitted
by Thursday.
   GATT is a multilateral trade agreement first established in 1947
and designed to establish rules, reduce tariffs and provide a
setting for a solution to international trade problems. Members of
the market-orientated organization, account for more than
four-fifths of world trade.
   The current Uruguay Round of trade talks is expected to end in
December with an ambitious new agreement to liberalize trade in
areas such as agriculture and textiles.

<HEAD>Sprint In Joint Venture in Soviet Union</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   US Sprint on Wednesday announced a joint
venture with two Soviet organizations to provide Sprint's
international data network services in the Soviet Union by late
1990.
   Kansas City, Mo.-based Sprint said it had signed a preliminary
agreement with the Central Telegraph of the Soviet Ministry of
Posts and Telecommunications and the Institute of Electronics and
Computer Science of the Latvian Academy of Sciences to form a new
company known as Telenet USSR.
   Voice communications are not involved in the agreement.
   The pact calls for Telenet USSR to operate a switching center in
Moscow to be connected with the SprintNet International data
network. It also will provide domestic and international electronic
messaging services, and distribute Sprint's Telenet product line of
data communications equipment in the Soviet Union.
   Details of the joint venture, including financing, will be
agreed on by midyear, the company said, with Telenet USSR
operations expected to begin by the end of the year.
   The pact requires approval by Soviet and U.S. government
authorities.
   Sprint International President Paolo Guidi said his company was
``delighted'' to be part of the perestroika process that is
building ``economic bridges between East and West.''
   Sprint declined to disclose the cost of its involvement in the
venture.
   Wednesday's announcement follows one in December in which
Denver-based US West said it would join with the Soviet phone
ministry and seven other international companies to build a
fiber-optic telecommunications line across the Soviet Union at a
cost of about $500 million.
   Commerce Department Secretary Robert Mosbacher, whose department
shares responsibility for issuing export licenses to U.S.
companies, has indicated the adminstration would look favorably on
US West's request as long as the Soviets do not receive the very
latest in U.S. fiber technology.
   The United States historically has taken a hard line on exports
of products that may be used militarily by Soviet Bloc nations. But
with the recent decline of communism in Eastern Europe, President
Bush has said he's willing to review export contraints contained in
the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls.
   Central Telegraph serves 120,000 Soviet telex subscribers and
4,000 international customers. The Latvian group is involved in
computer data communications.
   Syd Courson, a Sprint spokesman in Kansas City, said it was too
early to predict how much money would be generated from the Soviet
venture. In addition, it is not known how the Soviets will overcome
their shortage of Western currency to pay for Sprint's services and
equipment.
   Sprint, which created its Reston, Va.-based Sprint International
division on Jan. 1, plans to establish switching centers in 20
foreign markets this year.
   Its trans-Atlantic traffic is carried by the PTAT-1 fiber cable
that Sprint co-owns with Britain's Cable and Wireless PLC. PTAT-1,
which began operating last fall, was the first privately funded
trans-Atlantic fiber cable system. Its ability to handle 80,000
simultaneous transmissions is double the capacity of the TAT-8
fiber cable owned by the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and
state-owned phone companies in Europe, Canada and Australia.
   In another announcement Wednesday, Sprint also said it intends
to be part of a group of companies planning to build a $260 million
fiber-optic cable linking Japan, China, Hong Kong and Singapore.
   It has not been determined whether Sprint will have an ownership
position or purchase capacity on the cable, which will carry voice,
data and video signals.
   Sprint's international ambitions reflect the growing financial
strength of United Telecommunications Inc. of Westwood, Kan.,
Sprint's majority owner. United Telecom posted operating income of
$910 million in 1989, up from $252.8 million in 1988.
   Sprint's international telecommunications revenues are growing
20 percent a year, considerably faster than domestic revenues.

   A rush to reach business agreements
with East Germany is livening up the current Leipzig trade fair,
with a Bonn Cabinet minister predicting an ``avalanche'' of
German-German joint ventures will emerge from this year's event.
   West German carmakers Volkswagen, General Motors-owned Opel, and
Daimler-Benz, the Stuttgart-based maker of luxury cars and heavy
trucks, have jumped on the bandwagon, detailing joint venture deals
with East Germany's IFA automobile works.
   Others among the 1,000 West German companies vying for
joint-venture agreements and other deals at the weeklong fair
include the Thyssen AG industrial concern, electronics company
Siemens and precision optics firm Zeiss _ which reportedly is
negotiating a ``reunification'' with its East German counterpart
Carl Zeiss.
   The West German rush to sign preliminary agreements underlines
the confidence of managers that German unification is near and
there are profits to be made in rebuilding East Germany, which is
in economic shambles after 40 years of Communist rule.
   Last fall's peaceful popular revolt that ousted hardline leaders
has set the stage for the new age of German-German business
relations.
   The Leipzig fair is the oldest international trade fair in the
world, dating back more than 800 years, and is one of the biggest.
   Some 60 countries are participating in the spring edition of the
twice-annual event, which focuses on industrial equipment and
electronics, with the number of West German companies up by 25
percent from last year.
   West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann has predicted
``an avalanche of joint ventures'' following East Germany's first
free elections Sunday, after which the unification process is
expected to quicken.
   A day after the fair opened last Sunday, Volkswagen announced
details of the biggest deal so far at the current gathering, a
50-50 joint venture agreement with IFA.
   The companies plan to start modernizing IFA's antiquated
Trabants, which use two-stroke engines and became famous as the
smoke-belching transport of for the hordes of East Germans that
moved westward when the borders opened. IFA's factory at Zwickau
already is producing engines for the West German company.
   Later, Trabant production will be phased out and VW's Polo and
Golf models will be built at Zwickau, VW president Carl Hahn said.
   VW plans total investments of $2.94 billion by 1994, when about
1,000 cars per day should be coming off the assembly line, Hahn
said. Initial investments of $35.3 million are planned for the
plant, which hopes to be making about 50 Polo models a day by
December.
   Daimler-Benz and IFA also signed an agreement at the fair Monday
to build heavy trucks, but details of the planned joint venture
were still being worked out.
   The same applies to Opel, which said it was working on a
preliminary agreement with IFA's Wartburg automobile plant located
in the East German city of Eisenach, near the border with West
Germany.
   Other deals at the fair include preliminary agreements between
Siemens and a state electronics combine in Dresden to produce
industrial robots. Thyssen will join with another East German
congolomerate, Takraf, to produce building elevators and waste
processing plants.
   One of East Germany's largest combines, the 60,000-worker Carl
Zeiss company of Jena, reportedly is in secret negotiations with
the West German Zeiss company, set up by the former owners of Carl
Zeiss after the East German Communists expropriated them.
   The two companies are holding talks at the fair on joint
manufacture of computer chips and optical equipment, a
``reunification'' that could create one of the world's largest
producers of high-tech electronics, the Munich newspaper
Sueddeutsche Zeitung said Wednesday.

   Early March sales of cars and light trucks made
by the nation's Big Three automakers dipped 6.8 percent compared
with slow sales a year ago, the companies said Wednesday.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. said
they sold cars and light trucks at an average daily rate of 27,289
during the March 1-10 period this year, compared with 29,281 during
the same time last year.
   Car sales fell 7.7 percent, and truck sales were down 5.4
percent.
   March and April usually usher in a more bouyant car and truck
buying season as Americans shake off the winter and take to the
highways.
   But incentives offered during January and February of last year
had attracted would-be March and April buyers, depressing the sales
rate for the latter two months.
   The March 1989 sales rate was the lowest during the first nine
months of the year. Sales hit the skids during the final three
months of last year, but the pace picked up slightly after the
first of the year.
   Despite comparison with a slow sales period a year ago, early
March sales were lower this year.
   Through March 10 of this year, the car and truck selling rate
was running 2.6 percent behind last year's rate. Car sales were off
5.6 percent but truck sales were up 2.2 percent, mainly because of
strong Chrysler minivan sales in January.
   Chrysler said its early March car and truck sales were running
11.3 percent behind last year's pace, with car sales down 9.1
percent and truck sales off 13.4 percent.
   But for the year, Chrysler's car and truck sales were running
0.2 percent ahead of last year, with car sales down 6.9 percent and
truck sales up 6.8 percent.
   Ford said its early March car sales were down 8.1 percent and
truck sales were down 3.1 percent, combining for a 6.1 percent
sales decrease from year-ago levels. For the year, Ford's vehicle
sales were running 6.5 percent behind last year, with car sales
down 8.6 percent and truck sales down 3.5 percent.
   GM's combined car and truck sales for early March was down 5.7
percent compared with last year, as car sales fell 7.1 percent and
truck sales dropped 3.1 percent. So far this year, GM's car sales
were down 3.2 percent and truck sales were up 4.7 percent,
combining for a sales rate 0.7 percent below last year.

   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota, Mazda, Subaru and Mitsubishi are counted as domestic and

<HEAD>SEC Sues Brokerage House For Illegal Sales Tactics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission accused a
New York brokerage firm Wednesday of using illegal sales practices
to induce investors to buy over-the-counter securities.
   A civil lawsuit brought by the SEC alleged that Wellshire
Securities Inc. operated as a penny stock ``boiler room'' from July
1988 to the present, selling speculative over-the-counter
securities through high-pressure sales pitches and illegal means
that violated securities laws.
   The lawsuit, in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, charged that
Wellshire made exorbitant price predictions, gave out false
information about stocks, made unauthorized sales and tried to stop
clients from selling securities.
   In one case listed in the complaint, a 68-year-old retiree was
persuaded to borrow money from a home equity loan to buy securities.
   Wellshire's president, Robert Cohen, and executive vice
president, Carol Martino, were accused of knowing about and
encouraging the illegal sales practices. Three of Wellshire's
present and former brokers also were named in the lawsuit.
   ``We are reviewing the allegations and we have no comment,''
Cohen said when reached by telephone in his office.
   Wellshire _ with six branch offices in Long Island, New Jersey,
Florida, Georgia and Germany _ has about 50,000 customer accounts
and employs 100 brokers, the SEC said.
   The lawsuit also names two companies whose stock Wellshire
promoted _ Ventura Inc. of Needham, Mass., which had entertainment
and insurance subsidiaries, and Environmental Landfills Inc., the
owner of a landfill site in upstate Plattekill.
   The SEC said Ventura chairman Robert Beck and its director,
Richard Sand, misrepresented Ventura's profitability and made
fraudulent earnings predictions. This information was given to
Wellshire, whose brokers passed it on to investors, the lawsuit
alleges.
   Sand said he had no comment on the lawsuit. Beck was said to be
unavailable.
   Environmental Landfills and its chairman, Paul V. Winters, were
accused of making false and misleading statements about the legal
status of the landfill, regulatory approval of its cleanup and the
likelihood of the landfill's opening.
   This information was published in Wellshire's in-house market
letter and used to spur investments, the lawsuit said.
   Efforts to obtain comment from Environmental Landfills were
unsuccessful because the company had no telephone listing.
   A temporary restraining order that bars Wellshire, Cohen and
Martino from any further securities law violations was signed
Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Kevin Duffy. The order also
freezes the defendants' assets and requires they produce an
accounting of their finances.

<HEAD>Prudential Reports Drop in 1989 Profit; Sees Future Layoffs on
Wall Street</HEAD>

   Prudential Insurance Co. of America said
Wednesday that its 1989 profit slipped 10 percent from a year
earlier due largely to two major acquisitions that expanded its
real estate and securities businesses.
   Meanwhile, the head of its Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
subsidiary, disclosed there would be layoffs later this year in
response to the sluggishness on Wall Street.
   George Ball, Prudential-Bache chairman and chief executive
officer, did not specify the number of jobs that would be cut but
said the firm wanted to avoid ``the bludgeon approach.''
   Prudential said losses in its securities and residential real
estate operations were largely to blame for a drop in 1989 earnings
to $743 million from $829 million the previous year. Revenue,
however, rose 15 percent to $43.03 billion from $37.50 billion.
   Prudential, which is a mutual insurance company, said income
from operations before policy-owner dividends and income taxes
totaled $3.56 billion in 1989, down from $3.71 billion in 1988.
   The company said it had solid earnings gains in its insurance
and asset management businesses.
   The losses in its securities and real estate businesses came
mainly from Prudential's acquisition last year of Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co.'s residential real estate operations and the branch offices of
the Wall Street firm Thomson McKinnon Inc.
   At its annual media briefing, Prudential Chairman Robert C.
Winters called the approximatley $300 million real estate
acquisition the most significant strategic development for the
company last year. Prudential currently has more than 900 brokerage
offices with nearly 25,000 sales associates in 40 states.
   Winters said the Thomson McKinnon acquisiton would ``position
the firm to take full advantage of the potential we see down the
road for the securities industry.''
   ``Right now individual investors are staying away from the
marketplace,'' Winters said. ``We believe ultimately this period
will end. It's a cyclical business.''
   Several Wall Street firms, including Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc., have been contracting in recent months in part because of the
slowdown since the 1987 stock market crash and a decline in mergers
and acquisitions due to a sharp decline in the junk bond market.
   Ball, who also spoke at the annual briefing, said
Prudential-Bache was evaluating where future staff cuts would be
made. The firm currently has around 19,000 employees.
   ``I do expect our head count to be lower,'' he told reporters.
   Prudential-Bache recorded a net loss of $51 million in 1989,
compared with a $111 million profit the previous year.
   In its individual insurance sector, Prudential posted a 4
percent increase in new business premiums to $3.4 billion. Life
insurance sales slipped 15 percent to $806 million but annuity
sales rose 23 percent to $2.1 billion, it said.
   New property and casualty insurance sales were up 23 percent to
$342 million, but earnings were hurt by Hurricane Hugo and the San
Francisco earthquake, it said.
   The group insurance earnings also improved, Prudential said.
Premium and fees from new sales of group life and health coverages
were up 23 percent to $2 billion.
   Prudential said its institutional asset management group, which
manages a wide range of investments for pension funds and other
large institutional investors, had an 88 percent decline in sales
to $7.8 billion.

   General Motors Corp. on Wednesday recalled about
147,200 cars and vans in five separate actions for problems that
include the possibility of parts breaking in rear suspensions of
some Corvettes.
   The recall included 46,000 1988- and 1989-model Corvettes with
rear-wheel tie rod assemblies that may break, causing a loss of
control.
   GM spokesman Tom Pyden said the automaker wasn't aware of any
deaths or major injuries because of any of the problems.
   The automaker also recalled:
   _About 1,100 1990-model Pontiac Grand Prix SE Turbo cars for
removal of a rear spring heat shield which may puncture the fuel
tank in a collision.
   _About 84,000 1987-89 Chevrolet Corsica sedans because of door
hinge problems which could affect the car's ability to withstand a
side-impact crash.
   _About 10,000 1990 Buick Riviera and Cadillac Eldorado and
Seville cars with potentially sticky rear shoulder safety belt
assemblies.
   _Nearly 6,100 1987-89 Chevrolet and GMC Step Vans built for
commercial delivery for replacement of a seat pedestal which may
not be able to hold the seat or a passenger during a crash.
   GM said owners were being notified by mail. Inspections and
repairs will be performed for free.
