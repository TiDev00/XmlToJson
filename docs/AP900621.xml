<TEXT>
   The U.S. Navy sought Thursday to assure
the public that the aircraft carrier Midway was safe after two
explosions on board killed two crew members and seriously injured
nine.
   ``The safety of the ship was never in jeopardy,'' Rear Adm. Lyle
Bull, commander of the Battle Force 7th Fleet, told reporters
escorted aboard the ship a day after the fire.
   Japan, the only country to experience nuclear attack, asked the
U.S. military to improve its safety practices. Yokosuka officials
had demanded assurances of the 45-year-old carrier's safety before
its return.
   Demonstrators charged the ship was carrying nuclear weapons into
its home port at Yokosuka despite a Japanese ban. The United States
refuses to comment on the location of its nuclear weapons.
   About 50 protesters chanting ``Don't let the Midway land here''
and ``Nuclear Ship Get Out'' assembled outside the Navy base gate
about an hour before the 67,000-ton ship moored at Yokosuka, 28
miles southwest of Tokyo.
   Eight of the demonstrators wore sashes identifying them as
victims of the U.S. atomic bombings of the Japanese cities of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.
   Navy officials allowed relatives of the crew onto the ship
before reporters were taken aboard.
   ``Midway is safe and seaworthy in all respects,'' Bull said,
stressing that there was no danger to the ship's weapons systems
from the explosions.
   Bull said the first explosion occurred shortly after noon
Wednesday when a fire-fighting crew investigating smoke opened the
hatch to a 12-by-12-foot emergency equipment storeroom six decks
below the flight deck.
   ``Death most probably was instantaneous'' for the two sailors
killed in the blast, he said. In addition to the nine seriously
injured, who were flown to hospitals ashore, seven other injured
crewmen were treated on the ship.
   The second explosion came 45 minutes later, Bull said. Earlier,
Navy officials said there was a fire in the room. Bull said there
were explosions, burn injuries, smoke and intense heat, but not
necessarily a fire.
   The room was near a pipe for the ship's catapult system
containing pressurized steam at 850 degrees and ``water sprayed on
the bulkhead turned to steam, that's how hot it was,'' he said.
   One unidentified crew member interviewed on Japanese television
said a fuel pipe near the steam line cracked and leaked fuel, which
then ignited. Navy officials said they could not comment until an
investigation is complete.
   Capt. Arthur K. Cebrowski said about 1,000 sailors worked
through the night to secure the area and flood it with water and
foam and provide support. The bodies were found early Thursday, he
said.
   In Washington, the Pentagon identified the two dead sailors as
Ulric Patrick Johnson of Martinez, Calif., and Jeffrey Allan Vierra
of Nevada City, Calif.
   The Midway carries a crew of 4,500 and 62 aircraft. The
1,000-foot carrier was commissioned in 1945 and is the Navy's
oldest in active service, although it has been extensively
modernized.
   The explosions occurred as the ship participated in a joint
exercise 125 miles northeast of Yokosuka with the Japanese Maritime
Self Defense Force. Navy officials said the exercise would continue
without the Midway.
   In Japan many people have misgivings about the presence of
50,000 U.S. troops and U.S. armaments here.
   The Midway fire was the second serious Navy accident since a
series of incidents last fall killed 14 people.

<TEXT>
   Luther Campbell, beleaguered leader of the
controversial rap group 2 Live Crew, has come under attack from two
new sources: a former lover suing for child support and the NAACP's
top official.
   The Miami group's most popular album, ``As Nasty As They Wanna
Be,'' has been ruled obscene by a federal judge. Campbell and two
other group members were arrested June 10 in Hollywood, Fla., on
charges of giving an obscene performance.
   The obscenity ruling is being appealed, and the rappers are
awaiting a court date on the misdemeanor charge.
   On Thursday, day-care teacher Davania Branch went public over a
lawsuit she filed seeking support for the child she claims was
fathered two years ago by Campbell, 29.
   And Dr. Benjamin L. Hooks, executive director of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, criticized the
raw nature of some of 2 Live Crew's lyrics.
   Hooks said in a statement Wednesday that the NAACP found itself
``in the position of defending their right ... to freedom of
expression while at the same time condemning the vicious, sadistic,
and demeaning nature of some of their material.''
   ``We are particularly offended by their efforts to wrap the
mantle of the black cultural experience around their performances,
by saying this is the way it is in the black community,'' he said.
`` ... Our cultural experience does not include debasing our women,
the glorification of violence, the promotion of deviant sexual
behavior, or the tearing into shreds of our cherished mores of
standards of behavior.''
   But Hooks said the NAACP believed, as Campbell maintains, that
many of the attacks on the group ``contain some elements of
racism.'' Otherwise, he said, white perfomers who use profane, sexy
lyrics would also be condemned.
   Telephone calls seeking comment from Campbell on Thursday were
not returned.
   The Miami paternity lawsuit was filed in March, when Ms. Branch
accused Campbell of providing only ``sporadic and limited financial
support'' since the birth of 2-year-old Lutheria Renea Branch.
   ``I've had a lot of serious problems,'' she told reporters
Thursday. ``I have been struggling, and he knows this.''
   She said she was trying to provide the child ``with the best of
things that she needs.''
   ``When you're dealing with an infant, the milk is not cheap,''
she said.
   In a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, Campbell said he was not Ms.
Branch's exclusive lover during their relationship.

   Here are some facts about
Nelson Mandela:
   NAME: Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela.
   AGE: 71.
   BORN: July 18, 1918, in Transkei, the son of a Xhosa tribal
chief.
   TITLE: Deputy President of the African National Congress.
   ARRESTED: August 5, 1962.
   SENTENCED: November 1962 to five years hard labor for leaving
the country illegally and inciting blacks to violate the law by
striking. Sentenced in June 1964 to life imprisonment for sabotage
and plotting to overthrow the government.
   IMPRISONED: 27 years.
   RELEASED: February 11, 1990.
   CURRENT POLITICAL OBJECTIVE: Mandela says dialogue between the
South African government and the ANC is the only way to a peaceful
future. He wants the government to free all prisoners convicted of
politically motivated crimes, stop police from firing on black
protesters, and end the state of emergency in the Natal province,
where ANC supporters are battling members of the rival Inkatha
organization.
   When those conditions are met, he says, the ANC and the
government can enter into negotiations, apparently including other
political organizations, to develop a new non-racial, democratic
constitution based on a one-person, one-vote system.
   CURRENT TOUR: Mandela is on a six-week tour of Africa, Europe
and North America to thank the world for pressuring the South
African government to remove the ban on the ANC and free him and
his colleagues.
   He also is urging that economic, cultural, diplomatic and sports
sanctions be maintained against South Africa until apartheid is
completely abolished.

<TEXT>
   Norma Chavarria, a former teacher, has
opened a makeshift store to keep going until President Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro makes the stalled economy run and ``times get
better.''
   ``We have to give Violeta time,'' she said. ``How can a
president do in 40 days what the Sandinistas couldn't do in 10
years? My husband and I are confident things will get better in
about six months.''
   Mrs. Chavarria, 24, leaned on the counter in the dirt-floored
wooden shack, where she sells single cakes of laundry soap, soft
drinks, envelopes of soup mix and other inexpensive items.
   A neighbor who had just come in said: ``That's right. Those
Sandinistas didn't do anything except make us go to meetings. A
meeting for this, a meeting for that. We have to give a little time
to poor Dona Violeta.''
   Mrs. Chavarria's husband, Jose, is a bricklayer who brings home
$20 a month, slightly more than she earned as a grade school
teacher. Her teaching papers were lost they moved here recently
from Esteli, so they decided she should open the store.
   Many people seem to share the guarded optimism of Mrs. Chavarria
and the neighbor, but there also is a ``show me'' attitude that
good times are not just around the corner.
   Nicaraguans voted the Sandinistas out Feb. 25 and inflation
still is high nearly two months after Mrs. Chamorro's pro-American
government was inaugurated.
   Inflation reached 36,000 percent in 1988, then declined to 1,800
percent in 1989.
   Francisco Mayorga, president of the central bank, now gauges it
weekly. His figures were 47 percent for the first week of May, then
17 percent, 12 and 11 for the next three.
   Mayorga, who was educated at Yale and devised Mrs. Chamorro's
economic recovery plan, accused the Sandinistas of using the
two-month transition period to undermine the new government.
   He said they spent money wildly and printed more to cover the
deficit.
   President Bush signed a $300 million aid package May 26. The
first $60 million arrived quickly and, between May 25 and May 31,
the black market price of a dollar declined from 310,000 cordobas
to 290,000.
   ``The exchange houses are supplying dollars again; that's why it
went down,'' said Jose Gutierrez, one of two dozen currency dealers
on a street near the Mexican Embassy.
   Gutierrez and his colleagues wave wads of cordobas at passing
motorists, and police look the other way.
   Another sign of improvement is a 20 percent increase in planted
farm acreage over last year, Mayorga said. Food production fell
steadily under the Sandinistas.
   On the negative side, Nicaragua's currency has been devalued
frequently since Mrs. Chamorro took office. The parallel exchange
rate, which governs most dollar transactions, had gone from 70,800
cordobas to 226,600 by May 31.
   Some Chamorro supporters are beginning to grumble.
   ``Maybe we would have been better off under the Sandinistas,''
said Julio Gonzalez, 33, who runs an auto repair shop with his
cousin. Former President Daniel Ortega, he said, ``had the economy
more or less under control.''
   What does he expect to happen now? ``Maybe we'll see an
improvement in six months, a year, but it better happen. Just like
we knocked down Somoza, we knocked down the Sandinistas. Well, we
can knock down this government too.''
   The Sandinista revolution overthrew the late President Anastasio
Somosa in July 1979.
   Rolando Perez Sanchez, a 29-year-old Sandinista union leader,
listened with skepticism to Gonzalez, his friend and neighbor.
   ``It's not going to happen,'' he said, shaking his head. ``This
government if full of bourgeois who will hoard all the capital and
leave the workers the crumbs.
   ``What we have to do is what Daniel said _ rule from below to
defend the conquests of the revolution.''
   ``Ruling from below'' took the form of a crippling strike by
public employees in May, aftr which the government gave broad
concessions to unions.
   Mrs. Chamorro has had to proceed carefully because of the
militant Sandinista opposition.
   Her government plans to review confiscations of property under
the Sandinistas and continues to trim the huge bureaucracy, firing
public employees.
   Sandinista threats of more strikes if the firings continued have
not materialized, and their protest marches draw smaller crowds. If
economic improvement continues, the Sandinistas could lose the
leverage of being the defenders of worker's buying power.
   Another Sandinista rallying point, the Contra rebels, might
disappear once the guerrillas demobilize.
   ``I'm like St. Thomas; I'll have to see it to believe it,''
Gonzalez said.
   For Mrs. Chavarria, who has three small children, abolition of
the two-year draft for boys of 16 is great progress.
   ``You don't know what a relief this is for us mothers,'' she
said. ``As for the rest of it, we'll have to wait. At least we eat
every day.''

   Scientific research is about to blow the lid
off the mystery behind a common household horror: why thick soups
and stews explode and splatter the inside of microwave ovens.
   ``It's a consumer problem: the housewife or kid comes back and
here's lunch all over the inside of the microwave,'' said David W.
Cable, a mechanical engineer at MetriCor Inc. in Woodinville, Wash.
   MetriCor, a subsidiary of Corning Inc., sells $12,000 fiberoptic
sensors that are being used by Rutgers University scientists to
measure temperatures and pressures of food as it is cooked in
microwave ovens.
   He said the researchers want to know why some microwaved foods
splatter as they cook _ and how to prevent the messy problem.
   Cable, who is MetriCor's marketing and sales manager, presented
preliminary results of the study Wednesday during the annual
meeting of the Institute of Food Technologists, which drew more
than 15,000 food scientists to the Anaheim Convention Center.
   ``What causes cream of mushroom soup to attack the walls of a
microwave oven while chicken bouillon remains cautiously in its
bowl?'' the institute asked in a news release. ``Scientists are
coming close to an answer for that question.''
   Cable said a food being cooked in a microwave oven is injected
with microwave energy ``at a rate similar to lightning striking a
tree. The phenomenon is the same, except for its magnitude.''
   ``As water and sap (in a tree) flash to steam, the tree
literally explodes. ... This is what happens in the microwave to
foods that are trapping the steam.''
   Food scientists call the splattering phenomenon ``popping'' or
``bumping,'' Cable said.
   ``Some people have developed a sort of Richter scale of these
explosions,'' he said.
   Cable and the institute said that so far, the food-industry
sponsored study has provided the following solutions, some of which
may seem obvious:
   _Foods should be centered in the microwave because heat is more
evenly distributed there. The edges contain hot spots that are more
likely to make water in thick soups flash into exploding steam
bubbles.
   _Thicker soups are much more likely to splatter than thinner
liquids because heat concentrates more easily in a viscous liquid,
allowing steam bubbles to expand until they are large and create a
messy explosion.
   Cable suggested cooking thick soups or stews at lower power,
stirring them before putting them in the microwave oven, and
covering the cooking container with a paper towel to contain the
splattering.
   _If a cooking container contains ridges or some other rough
surface, bubbles can form more easily and in greater numbers. And
lots of small bubbles distribute heat more evenly, while a few
large bubbles are more likely to send the soup flying.
   The Rutgers study may result in improvements in packaging for
microwaveable foods, allowing them to be cooked with less mess,
Cable said.
   Cable acknowledged the research may seem silly, but said
consumers ``don't expect this nice clean package you put in your
microwave to come apart and throw food all over the inside.
   ``It's a cleanup issue, and we're all tidy Americans. We don't
like to be untidy.''

   Nelson Mandela received a hero's welcome
Wednesday as he arrived for his first visit to the United States.
The South African freedom fighter was feted with a ticker-tape
parade, the key to the city and an outpouring of support by more
than 800,000 people.
   The African National Congress leader responded with a plea for
continued economic sanctions against his homeland _ a theme he has
sounded throughout his worldwide tour.
   ``We appeal to you in all humility and in all sincerity that you
must join us in the internal actions that you are taking to force
the government to abandon apartheid,'' Mandela said shortly after
landing at Kennedy International Airport.
   There and at City Hall, Mandela thanked Americans for their
support of the anti-apartheid movement. After receiving the key to
the city, he declared: ``Apartheid is doomed. South Africa shall be
free. The struggle continues.''
   He told the City Hall crowd that he envisions a new South
Africa, one ``which banishes forever racism in all its forms and
becomes a truly non-racial, non-sexist society.''
   In Huntsville, Ala., President Bush reiterated that the United
States would not lift economic sanctions against South Africa until
that country meets the requirements of the sanctions law. Those
requirements include the release of all political prisoners in
South Africa.
   Mandela is to meet with Bush during a later stop in Washington.
   Police estimated that 350,000 people lined streets along
Mandela's route from the airport, and another 450,000 turned out
for the ticker-tape parade up Broadway's ``Canyon of Heroes.''
   The ANC leader was in a specially designed ``Mandelamobile,'' a
flatbed truck outfitted with a bulletproof glass shed.
   The crowd cheered wildly as Mandela passed by. Many wore Mandela
buttons and waved posters with his picture.
   ``I just feel proud,'' said Denise Brutus, an American Airlines
employee. ``I'm so happy. I couldn't stay home and watch it. I had
to be in his presence.''
   The avenue was ankle-deep in ticker tape and other paper. Trees
and traffic lights throughout the area were dripping with streams
of computer paper.
   Judith Bateman, a senior citizens program director from
Irvington, N.J., showed up early to insure a first row seat.
   ``I pray for him every night,'' said Bateman, who was outfitted
in a red T-shirt with a map of Africa and wore a Mandela button.
``He is a dream to the human people.''
   Bateman's traveling companion, Shirley Coxson, said she wished
she could give Mandela this simple message: ``We love you. God
bless you.''
   Along with those who showed up to cheer Mandela were thousands
of city police, and federal and state agents _ part of a security
detail dubbed ``Operation Topaz.''
   Mandela was greeted at the airport by dignitaries including Gov.
Mario Cuomo, who said Mandela's visit was ``not a victory lap but a
long distance journey to remind us that until South Africa is
completely free the march toward freedom has not reached its final
destination.''
   Mayor David Dinkins, the city's first black mayor, gave the man
he has called his hero a giant bear hug upon meeting him and
promised:
   ``One day in this lifetime we will reach freedom's gate together
and ... pass through to a land where we all will be judged by our
fellow beings for the content of our character rather than the
color of our skin.''
   Despite a two-hour arrival delay, Mandela insisted on stopping
at a Brooklyn high school where thousands of students and residents
from the predominantly black Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood
greeted him with cheers of ``Man-del-a!'' and ``Keep the pressure
on.''
   ``I sincerely feel very strong and encouraged because if in our
struggle we receive the support of the youth of the world, then our
cause can never fail, can never be lost,'' Mandela told the crowd.
   He then ate lunch at the Coast Guard station in Battery Park
overlooking the Statue of Liberty. After lunch, he and his wife,
Winnie, stepped outside to look at the statue before leaving for
the parade.
   The Mandelas arrived from Canada nearly two hours late after
tour organizers decided the 71-year-old Mandela needed extra rest.
Mandela had a benign cyst removed from his bladder less than three
weeks ago.
   Organizers said the U.S. leg of Mandela's 13-nation tour may be
pared back. The schedule calls for Mandela to participate in 34
major events during his 12-day, eight-city trip.
   ``We're playing it by ear,'' said Sylvia Hill, associate
coordinator of Mandela's national welcoming committee.
   After-dinner meetings with South African exiles and black
journalists Wednesday night were cancelled and a Thursday breakfast
with the Rev. Jesse Jackson was also scrapped so that Mandela could
get more rest. Instead, he was to meet with Jackson shortly before
a meeting later in the morning with religious leaders, said mayoral
spokesman Tom Kelly.
   Mandela was released from prison four months ago after serving
27 years for his activities on behalf of South Africa's black
majority. During that time, his name became a rallying cry around
the world for black equality.
   After his release, he resumed his active role in the ANC and is
presently seeking money and political support for the movement.
   Mandela waved to the cheering crowd as he stepped off the plane
and raised a clenched fist as the Boys Choir of Harlem sang the ANC
anthem.
   He and his wife wore scarves with the ANC colors of gold, green
and black. They were given to them by two children representing the
local ANC youth group.
   On hand to greet Mandela were his daughter, Zenani; the Rev.
Jesse Jackson; Dinkins; Cuomo; New Jersey Gov. Jim Florio; and
entertainer Harry Belafonte, along with hundreds of well-wishers.
   ``The presence of Nelson Mandela generates hope around the
world,'' Jackson said before Mandela's arrival. ``Just as the walls
came down in Berlin, they should come down in South Africa as
well.''
   Mandela will stay with the Dinkinses at the mayor's official
residence, Gracie Mansion, during his three-day stay in New York.
Mandela is scheduled to participate in an outdoor rally in Harlem
and a Yankee Stadium fund-raiser on Thursday and address the United
Nations General Assembly on Friday.
   He is scheduled to depart Saturday morning for Boston. The trip
continues with stops in Washington, D.C., and a meeting with
President Bush, Atlanta, Miami, Detroit, Los Angeles and Oakland,
Calif., before he departs the United States on July 1.

<HEAD>Study Finds Benefit from Controversial AIDS Drug</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A report today that a controversial drug appears
to slow the onset of AIDS has met with skepticism from doctors with
the Food and Drug Administration.
   The study, conducted in Scandinavia, found that isoprinosine
resulted in an eightfold reduction in the progression to AIDS in
infected people who took the medicine for six months.
   FDA doctors noted that earlier studies showed no benefit from
the treatment.
   AZT is the only drug approved to slow the onset of AIDS in
people infected with the AIDS virus. It works by attacking the
virus directly, interfering with its reproduction inside the body.
   While no one knows precisely how isoprinosine works, doctors
speculated it boosts the power of white blood cells that fight
infection.
   In the latest report, Dr. Court Pedersen of the University of
Copenhagen and other doctors from Denmark and Sweden reported on
use of the medicine in 866 patients. They reported their findings
in the New England Journal of Medicine.
   ``We conclude that treatment with inosine pranobex
(isoprinosine) delays progression to AIDS in patients with HIV
infection,'' they wrote. HIV is the human immunodeficiency virus,
which causes AIDS.
   The study was conducted on men and women who were infected with
the virus but had no symptoms of AIDS. A total of 429 took
isoprinosine, while 437 got dummy pills.
   During the treatment period, two patients on isoprinosine
developed AIDS, compared with 17 people in the comparison group.
However, levels of helper T cells, the white blood cells that are
the primary target of the AIDS virus, fell identically in both
groups.
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Sandra L. Kweder and two other
FDA physicians expressed skepticism.
   Because of conflicting results of other studies and the lack of
understanding of how the drug might work, more study is needed
before isoprinosine can be considered effective by doctors and the
FDA, they wrote.
   In 1986, the FDA accused Newport Pharmaceuticals International,
which manufactures the drug, of making misleading claims about its
usefulness against AIDS. Two years later, the company announced the
drug had proved ineffective in clinical testing.

<HEAD>AIDS Poses Major Hazard for Some Operating Room Personnel</HEAD>

   Getting infected with the AIDS virus is a major
hazard for doctors and nurses who work in operating rooms in places
where AIDS is common, researchers reported today.
   Their study estimates that at San Francisco General Hospital,
where the research was conducted, there is likely to be one AIDS
infection every eight years among operating room personnel because
of on-the job exposure.
   But in most cities, where AIDS is far less common, the risk is
closer to one infection every 80 years, the study said.
   Some surgeons and other doctors have urged testing of patients
for AIDS infection before surgery so they will be extra careful
when operating on them.
   However, the latest study concludes that this is unlikely to
help.
   It found that even if doctors highly suspected that their
patients were infected, they were just as likely to be exposed to
their blood.
   The study was directed by Dr. Julie Gerberding and published in
today's New England Journal of Medicine.
   AIDS infection ``represents a major life-threatening
occupational hazard for surgical personnel practicing at San
Francisco General Hospital and similar locales with a high
prevalence of HIV,'' the researchers wrote. HIV, or human
immunodeficiency virus, causes AIDS.
   The study was based on a review of 1,307 consecutive surgical
procedures performed over two months in 1988.
   In 22 cases, doctors and nurses suffered cuts and other mishaps
that could have brought the AIDS virus into their bodies. These
included needle jabs, cuts with surgical instruments and blood
splashed into the eyes.
   In 95 other cases, they had patients' blood on their skin,
mostly through tears in gloves, splashes in the face or
blood-soaked gowns.
   Chances are slight that a single exposure, even a needle jab,
will result in infection, although several such cases have been
documented, scientists say.
   Based on their data, the doctors wrote, ``we calculated a
theoretical risk of HIV infection in surgical personnel at San
Francisco General Hospital of 0.125 infections per year, or one
infection every eight years.''

   Concern for Nelson Mandela's health prompted
cuts in his schedule Wednesday even before he left Canada to begin
a busy visit in the United States.
   ``We're heeding the winds of caution,'' Sylvia Hill, a tour
organizer, said in announcing that Mandela, a month short of 72
years old and less than three weeks out of the hospital, needed
rest and would arrive late.
   ``We feel after careful review, particularly based on the prior
schedule in Canada, we must scale back his program,'' she said.
   ``We were told this morning that Mr. Mandela himself felt the
schedule was too heavy, and he asked for the changes,'' said
Cecelia McCall, a tour committee spokeswoman.
   Lindiwe Mabuza, the African National Congress representative in
the United States, said that after talking with the Mandela party
in Canada early Wednesday, ``I didn't get the impression he was
sick; I got the impression he needed rest.''
   Mandela's arrival nearly two hours behind schedule cut some of
his rest time between speaking at a Brooklyn high school and his
ticker-tape parade on Broadway. The last event of the day,
after-dinner meetings with South African exiles, was dropped so he
could turn in early.
   A breakfast Thursday with the Rev. Jesse Jackson was also
scrapped. Instead, he was to meet with Jackson shortly before a
meeting later in the morning with religious leaders, said mayoral
spokesman Tom Kelly.
   Since he left a hospital bed on June 3, Mandela has described
his health as good. But organizers of the American leg of Mandela's
13-nation tour said from the start that he may be overbooked and
that protecting his health would come first.
   Coordinator Roger Wilkins labeled the the U.S. schedule of 34
major events in eight cities in 12 days as tentative, and asserted
that Mandela was ``a precious, 71-year-old human being rather than
an ambulatory prize to help Americans feel good about themselves.''
   Mandela had a cyst removed from his bladder in Johannesburg,
South Africa, during the last week of May. He was sent off with a
supply of vitamins and antibiotics for the trip.
   His doctor described him then as being medically like a man of
50.

<DATELINE>TANGERMUENDE, East Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the gritty, decaying
factories of this town along the Elbe river, the talk is of job
dismissal notices threatening hundreds of workers.
   Tangermuende is one of scores of towns and cities throughout
East Germany where free-market spirit will soon lead to the
shutdown of Communist-built plants.
   Despite hopes for a brighter tomorrow, the dirt-covered work
places of today are looking better and better.
   ``You can imagine what would have happened if Henry Ford had
pulled out of Detroit,'' said engineer Guenter Netzband. ``The
whole city would have died.''
   The wood products and chipboard factory where Netzband works is
faced with a 50 percent drop in demand for its products, in large
part because East Germany has been flooded with West German
products.
   ``The first job dismissal notices already have gone out. This is
something we never faced in 40 years,'' said the 64-year-old
Netzband. It is expected that at least 800 of the 1,200 workers
will be unemployed by the autumn.
   Nationwide, the number of unemployed is expected to swell a
staggering 25 percent of the work force of 8 million, as clothing,
textile and machinery factories collapse.
   Burdened with debt and bad management, East Germany's factories
will face enormous pressures once the West German mark becomes the
currency for both countries July 2. Unemployment benefits will
climb from the current 63 percent of one's salary to 75 percent,
but the jobless will still find themselves short of money when
prices rise across the board.
   The Creditreform economics information center of West Germany
predicts that more than half of East Germany's 8,000 businesses
will fold. The rest will be saved in part, during the shift from
state ownership to fledgling private ownership.
   Some people have predicted a ``hot autumn'' of unrest after
workers come back from summer vacations to face life without a job.
   In Tangermuende, a nearly 1,000-year-old town along one of
central Europe's major waterways, the situation will be especially
acute in the coming months. Four factories in this town employ
about 2,000 people, and only several hundred have more or less
certain jobs. The rest may soon find themselves out of work.
   ``The mood here is lousy,'' said 22-year-old Mario Engel,
outside the dilapidated VEB OGEMA factory. ``I'm just waiting for
my lay-off notice.''
   The OGEMA factory, which makes syrups for soda and jams, has
tried to attract West German companies. But the Dickensian sight of
rotting pipes, broken windows and heaps of rubble has scared away
potential partners.
   ``Sure people are all worked up,'' said 53-year-old OGEMA porter
Elfriede Piotrovski, who started working at the factory as a
teen-ager. ``Everything is up in the air. We just don't know what's
going on.''
   Beyond the threatened factory jobs, hundreds of others nearby
may soon be unemployed, including the 500 forestry workers who
supply the wood products plant with timber.
   ``The End is Looming for a Small City,'' said the East German
labor union newspaper Tribuene in a front page report about
Tangermuende.
   Where the town will head remains to be seen, as is the case for
hundreds of other East German communities. Retraining courses are
sprouting up. Computer training appears to be a favorite.
   ``Engineers don't have to become boilermen or ironworkers,'' is
the motto at one training center in nearby Magdeburg.
   Tangermuende economics director Joachim Roexe would like to see
development of tourism in Tangermuende, where a handful of restored
homes shows how beautiful the town could be if the historic center
were restored.
   ``West German tourists, when they see Tangermuende for the first
time, compare it with Rothenburg ob der Tauber,'' Roexe said
proudly, referring to the carefully restored, West German medieval
village that attracts millions of visitors each year.
   Roexe is also hoping for a partial rescue by West German firms,
although he acknowledges that so far no contracts have been signed.
New businesses are also being sought.
   One thing is clear: the city's industry is woefully behind
Western standards.
   ``There was plenty of idle time in the factories, but the
employees weren't at fault,'' said Roexe. ``There were
technological and organizational problems.''
   ``Often, there wasn't any material, or there was idle time
because the macines broke down,'' he added.
   He criticized local managers for insisting on keeping all jobs
as they negotiated with potential West German investors,
   ``They tried to save all of the jobs, but wound up jeopardizing
all of them,'' he said.
   Roexe said there are some comparable West German wood factories
that can produce more products at a lower price than those coming
from the Tangermuende plant, and with one-third the work force.
   The former Communist mayor of Tangermuende, Roexe was thrown out
of office after the democratically elected government took over.
   For Roexe, the local economic troubles are hitting home.
   His wife, Eva-Maria, is likely to lose her job at the chipboard
factory, while his 20-year-old daughter works at a nearby nuclear
plant under construction. The plant may be abandoned because of
massive safety problems.

   Here is the text of President Bush's
news conference Wednesday at the Marshall Space Flight Center:
   BUSH: Are we ready?
   Well, based on the recommendation of the Secretary of State, I
have decided to suspend the dialogue between the United States and
the PLO pending a satisfactory response from the PLO of steps it is
taking to resolve problems associated with the recent acts of
terrorism; in particular, that May 30th terrorist attack on Israel
by the Palestinian Liberation Front, a constituent group of the PLO.
   By way of background, on December 14th, 1988, Yassir Arafat,
speaking on behalf of the PLO Executive Committee, recognized
Israel's right to exist. He accepted the United Nations Security
Council Resolutions 242 and 338, and he renounced terrorism.
   Now subsequently, the United States announced that because the
PLO had met our longstanding conditions for dialogue we would begin
a substantive dialogue with the PLO.
   And at the time we applauded Chairman Arafat for taking these
essential steps, and we have conducted such a dialogue with the PLO
through our embassy in Tunis.
   Over the past 18 months representatives of the United States and
the PLO regularly exchanged views about the political and security
situation in the region. On balance, we believe that these
exchanges contributed to progress in the peace process.
   On May 30th, 1990, the Palestinian Liberation Front attempted a
seaborne terrorist infiltration into Israel. Palestinian Liberation
Front leader Abu Abbas represents the PLO on the Executive
Committee of the PLO. The size of the force and the geographical
target area strongly indicate that civilians would have been the
target.
   That day we issued a statement deploring this attempted
terrorist attack.
   On May 31st, we raised this incident with the PLO in Tunis. We
told them that it could not avoid responsibility for an attempted
terrorist action by one of its constituent groups and needed to
take steps to deal with the matter by condemning the operation,
disassociating itself from it, and by also beginning to take steps
to discipline Abu Abbas, the perpetrator.
   We've given the PLO ample time to deal with this issue. To date,
the PLO has not provided a credible accounting of this incident or
undertaken the actions outlined above. The US does take note of the
fact that the PLO has disassociated itself from this attack and
issued a statement condemning attacks against civilians in
principle, but as we previously indicated, this is not sufficient _
this alone is not sufficient.
   The U.S.-PLO dialogue has demonstrated that it can advance the
Arab-Israeli peace process, and at the same time the dialogue is
based on the assumption that the PLO is willing to abide by the
conditions it accepted in December 1988, including renunciation of
terror.
   And any time that the PLO is prepared to take the necessary
steps, we are prepared to promptly resume the dialogue. In the
meantime, we would hope and expect that the peace process would
proceed as intended, and without delay. We remain committed to the
pursuit of a comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict
and to a just and lasting peace.
   And as we often stated, it is our view that such a peace must be
based on those two resolutions, UN resolution 242 and 338, and the
principle implicit therein of territory for peace, and provide for
Israel's security and Palestinian political rights.
   We believe that Palestinian participation is vital to any
successful process and that there are real opportunities for
Palestinians in this process.
   We strongly hope that Israelis, Palestinians and the Arab states
will recognize these opportunities and take the necessary steps to
create an environment in which a viable peace process can thrive.
   We denounce violence in the area, and call upon all parties to
eschew violence and terror, and opt instead for dialogue and
negotiation. We are prepared to continue working with the parties
toward this end.
   I'll be glad to take a few questions.

<HEAD>HUNTSVILLE, Ala.: few questions.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: Mr. President, about your announcement _
   Q: Mr. President _
   Bush: Yes, John. Sorry, Norm.
   Q: doesn't your announcement of today, coupled with Secretary
Baker's words that the Israelis should call the White House when
they are serious, mean that the U.S. position on the peace process
in the Middle East is dormant right now?
   Bush: John, it's not moving forward right now, and the offer
still stands. I have sent a letter to Prime Minister Shamir. I have
very specifically asked questions that relate to seriousness about
the peace process.
   But I would like to see the peace process move forward. Nothing
herein should indicate anything different, because here we are
simply taking (inaudible) shot at terrorism.
   Norm, excuse me. I forgot my protocol here.
   Q: Marlin seemed to have lit a fairly short political fuse with
his comments on the S&amp;L bailout in accusing the Democrats of having
had a big part in that mess.
   Are you ready to play that game this election year and blame the
Democrats for a problem that others have laid on years of
permissive regulation by the Reagan administration?
   Bush: Norm, you're almost getting me into the fight by the way
you ask the question. But no, I'm not going to _ (chuckles) _ no, I
want to get the savings and loan problem solved.
   And Marlin, properly, seeing a couple of shots across my bow
from certain distinguished members of the United States Senate,
decided not to acquiesce in those attacks without some response.
   What he did was appropriate. But, what I'm trying to do is not
respond to individuals and to simply keep moving forward on this _
on this process, and not try to be out there saying here's who's to
blame and here's who's not to blame.
   But, it was interesting because I think you're right _ a spark
seemed to be ignited there _ and I think more important than
continuing to pour fuel on that spark is to work cooperatively with
the Congress in trying to get this mess solved.
   And of course, that is a part of what will be discussed in the
budget process.
   I would say to the American people on this one, the obligation
is to protect the depositor _ that's what our obligation is.
   And another obligation is to prosecute those who have broken the
law, and there has been an active prosecution under way. I talked
with Dick Thornburgh at lunch yesterday. I got some impressive
numbers of the numbers of cases that are _ that are being followed
up on now, and I expect we'll see plenty more.
   So, protect the depositor, put those that are guilty into the
dock where they belong, and see that they are, you know, brought to
responsibility for what they've done.
   Q: Do you, in retrospect though, agree with the argument that
deregulation or unregulation of the savings and loan, the financial
industry, occurred too quickly, went too far in the '80s?
   Bush: Well, I think _ in looking back, I think some of the
excesses of the loan policies are rather obvious. Basically, we
made some proposals, I think, in that task force that I headed that
might have corrected some of the abuse.
   But, I don't want to _ I don't want to argue in favor of
reregulation of industries. But, I will say that I think some of
the loan policies instituted after the changes were made were
foolish and were certainly ill-advised. And the result is a
pounding for the original purpose of the S&amp;Ls, which was financing
_ primarily financing housing in this country.
   Yeah, John?
   Q: Is it true that none of our allies, with the exception, of
course, of the Israelis, wanted you to suspend these talks with the
PLO? And you said you have given the PLO enough time. I mean, why
now? I mean, is there some reason to toughen in today?
   Bush: No, I don't think of any reason today. And I didn't set
it, you know, in my mind, X numbers of days. But, John, I think
there will be a lack of agreement with what I've done here on the
part of our strongest allies.
   And I know this is true on the part of some of the most
reasonable and moderate Arab states.
   But I would simply remind them of the conditions upon which the
dialogue started in the first place. And I would also remind them
that if they look at this statement and remedial action is taken,
the dialogue, from the U.S. side, can promptly be restored.
   Jerry?

<TEXT>
   Q: Mr. President, at the same time you're having this trouble
with the PLO you've also got a new Israeli government that has an
avowed policy of settling in the West Bank more rapidly than it's
been settled in the past. How are you going to deal with that
government? What's your policy going to be on aid for that
government, specifically on housing guarantees for Soviet
immigrants?
   Bush: Well, Jerry, I think I probably _ my position on
settlement in the territories is probably as well known as
anything. And our policy is not to have new settlements, and our
policy is certainly not to finance new settlements. Is that
responsive, or was there another part to your question?
   Q: There's a specific question now, though, of whether we'll
provide housing guarantees for Soviet immigrants of ($100 million?).
   Bush: Well, but not to settle in the _ in the post _ '67
territory _ in the territories, beyond the '67 lines.
   Q: Are you going to seek specific new guarantees from this new
government that that won't happen _
   Bush: Well, I will, and I hope I'm successful. But I think they
_ they _ there is no question that the Shamir government knows my
position on this, knows the standing position of the United States.
   Here, and then Jim.
   Q: Mr. President, as you know, Nelson Mandela arrived in the
United States today, and you're going to meet with him next week.
What are you going to tell him on the sanctions question?
   And second, the second part, there have been reports, oh, some
weeks ago that the United States Central Intelligence Agency was
involved in a process that led to a rift many years ago. And there
have been suggestions that you should apologize on behalf of the
United States government and the American people. Will you do that?
   Bush: No. I will take my leadership on that question from Mr.
Mandela, who put it very well when he said, ``Let bygones be
bygones,'' and that is not to agree with or disagree with the
charge.
   On the second point _ your first, my second _ the sanctions,
under the law, cannot be lifted until certain additional steps are
taken by South Africa.
   Let me be very clear _ I salute Mr. de Klerk for what he's done.
He's come a long, long way. And I salute Mr. Mandela for his
approach to de Klerk. I think that demonstrates a willingness to
talk that few of us might have predicted a couple of years ago. But
there still are things that have to be done under our law in order
to lift the sanctions.
   And I've listed them here, but anyway, you don't want to go into
the details on it, but if you do, I'd be glad to click them off for
you.
   But in any event, there has to be progress. And I'd like to find
a way to show Mr. de Klerk that we, the United States, are grateful
for this new approach that is having South Africa evolve to a much
more open society and hopefully one day to one which is color blind
in terms of participation in the political process.
   But I can't lift the sanctions under existing U.S. law. But I'm
looking forward to talking to Mr. Mandela about this. There are
black leaders in South Africa that disagree with him on this
question of sanctions. The foremost of those that come to mind is
Mr. Buthelezi, but _ with whom I have talked about this question.
   And I historically have not felt that certainly adding to the
sanction base would help at all, and I had some original
reservations about a sanction approach. But I will say that it
seems to _ if you can credit sanctions with the evolution of _
towards democracy in South Africa, I'd have to say, well, it seems
to be, you know, there are some good things to it.
   But it's delicate, because I want to find a way to show our
appreciation to de Klerk, and yet I don't want to pull the rug out
from under Mr. Mandela.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Weary from only a few hours' sleep, Cecelie
Blakey began another long day at the telephone, changing Nelson
Mandela's tour schedule for the umpteenth time and frustrating a
lot of folks who had counted on seeing him up close and personal.
   ``They are not going to like this at all,'' Blakey, associate
coordinator of the Mandela Tour National Welcome Committee, said as
she dialed.
   This day, she was breaking the news that Mandela had decided not
to attend any event on his U.S. tour before 9 a.m. or after 9 p.m.
That word came on the eve of Mandela's Wednesday arrival in New
York, effectively axing a lot of early-morning and late-evening
events already planned for the eight-city, 12-day tour.
   ``You'd be surprised how many breakfasts there are,'' said
Blakey, throwing up her hands.
   When the news got to Capitol Hill, the Congressional Black
Caucus was finalizing plans for an 8 a.m. sit-down breakfast for
350 next Tuesday. That was clearly out, and alternatives were still
up in the air early today.
   The South African black nationalist leader is nearly 72,
recently had minor surgery and already has been on tour for several
weeks.
   Blakey said the reactions to her schedule changes have run the
gamut.
   ``People can be quite crass,'' she said. ``They'll say `we've
collected X amount of dollars and if he wants the money then he
must come to a private reception,' or whatever.''
   Then there are ``people who just learned about Mandela but are
now insisting they have been at the forefront of the anti-apartheid
movement and deserve a photo opportunity with a signed picture,''
she said.
   Blakey and other tour organizers said Mandela's main message is
to keep economic sanctions and other pressure for change on the
white South African government.
   With that mission, Blakey said, Mandela must speak at the United
Nations and Congress, reassure the New York financial community and
meet with President Bush. The other activities are just extras, she
said.
   ``People are very possessive about not only their cities but
their neighborhoods,'' Blakey said of the hundreds of daily phone
calls asking, ``Why not a trip to Philadelphia, Houston, the rural
South? Why not swing by Baltimore for a quick appearance at a
convention?
   ``Hundreds of requests are rejected daily and we're still
turning them down.''
   The State Department has received requests for credentials from
more than 5,500 media personnel.
   ``Mandela is a man who should be a president but isn't,'' said
Blakey, ticking off the privileges that are being denied, like
Secret Service and Blair House accommodations.
   The tour is being organized by private groups led by
TransAfrica, an anti-apartheid lobbying group.
   ``This is the first time African-Americans have had an
opportunity to plan at this level,'' she said. ``Because he happens
to be a black leader and because African-Americans play such key
roles, it has been humbling to see the little power we have.''
   The clamor for tickets, interviews, photo opportunities and
other contact with Mandela by people willing to try everything
imaginable to get on the tight schedule, she said, ``demonstrates
our success in educating people about apartheid and making it a
popular cause.''
   ``I've never seen anyone who is loved as much as this man and
it's not just blacks,'' said Lisa Alfred, legislative assistant
with TransAfrica.
   Officials at Fenton Communications, the public relations firm
overseeing local events in Washington without a fee, said there are
about five file folders crammed with requests for interviews and as
many as 50 telephone calls are being fielded each hour.
   ``It's been incredibly hectic,'' Alfred said. ``People are
calling saying they named their baby Nelson Mandela and they want
him to baptize the child, some want him to come by their house for
a barbecue or to eat potato salad.''
   Alfred has been helping with ticket sales for a rally slated for
next Tuesday evening at the Washington Convention Center. Officials
expected to sell all the 20,000 tickets for $10 and $25 by today.
   Controlling the rally tickets has been a major challenge for
Alfred because TransAfrica wants Mandela to address a wide range of
Washington residents. Tickets for 12,000 were distributed among 40
groups, including the elderly and labor unions.
   The remaining tickets were sold daily only two hours a day for
about a week.
   ``People still call and beg for tickets,'' said Alfred. ``Some
say they plan to just come to the center and stand outside during
the rally.''

<HEAD>HUNTSVILLE, Ala.: Mr. Mandela.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: Mr. President _
   Q: Mr. President, are you _
   Bush: Oh, Jim. Sorry, we'll come back. You're standing up. I
can't see you.
   Q: Mr. President, are you planning to support a G-7 initiative
to offer economic aid to the Soviet Union at next month's economic
summit? And if so, what has caused you to change your mind on that?
   Bush: No, I'm not planning to do that, and I expect, though,
that matter may be discussed. There are _ I've tried to be very up
front with Mr. Gorbachev when he was here about difficulties in
terms of financial support. I talked to him in Malta about that.
   Indeed, we presented him with a list of things that might be
done to improve our ability to work in full cooperation with them
on that.
   But I don't plan a new _ a new initiative. And yet, I want to
see perestroika continue. I haven't changed my view that economic
reform is important, and I recognize that support from the West can
well _ can well help the economy.
   But there is an awful lot of reform that has to take place in
the market and the distribution systems. There's some political
problems that we have that I've discussed very frankly with Mr.
Gorbachev, not the least of them $5 billion a year going down to
Cuba.
   So we've still got some problems there, but discount the fact
that we are planning some bold new initiative. On the other hand,
I'm perfectly prepared to talk to our allies on any subject, and I
think that will probably be one of them.
   Q: Well there are reports that President Mitterrand would
propose such a plan. Is that _
   Bush: Well, the Germans are interested, too, and I'm not saying
we're not interested, but I am saying there are some formidable
obstacles.
   Yeah, Jim?
   Q: Back on the PLO, one of the theories passed around in your
own administration was that the intent of this terrorist attack was
to derail the peace process. Are you at all concerned that by
suspending the dialogue you're playing into the hands of the
hard-liners like Abu Abbus? And is there also a danger _
   Bush: Yes. Let me stop you there, just to respond, so I don't
get _ forget the question. Yes I am concerned about that. Go ahead.
(Scattered laughter.)
   Q: Well, if you're so concerned about it, then why did you _ why
did you take this action?
   Bush: Well, because we had to weigh the whole question and the
question was complicated by the fact that there were three specific
undertakings, one of which, a very important one in my view, has
clearly has been violated.
   So _ but _ it's not an easy call, because I know some feel that
the PLO dialogue is totally unproductive, and as I indicated in
this statement, I don't.
   And the question up here was, well, do our allies _ will they
agree with the steps that I've taken here in Huntsville today? And
the answer is, no, some of them will not agree, because they do
feel that the dialogue has kind of helped calm things in some parts
of the Middle East.
   So _ so, what the answer to it is, is for the PLO to take the
action that I've called for and to satisfactorily _ to satisfy us
that those who were responsible will be disciplined, and condemn
this specific act. It's not enough to simply reiterate one's
concern on terror.
   Q: If I may follow up?
   Bush: Please.
   Q: Is there a danger, too, that those Palestinians who would put
some hope in the dialogue between the PLO and the U.S. might now
throw up their hands in desperation and resort to violence?
   Bush: Well, I hope that's not the case, and yet _ I would refer
you to the very last page of my _ last paragraph or two of the
statement, when I did call for no violence, and I think it's fair
to say that at any time you're dealing with something as
complicated as the Middle East, you worry about that.
   But I hope that's not the case, and I hope they'll see in my
statement a rather temperate view here that, though we're specific
in calling for the condemnation of this particular terrorist act,
that once that is done, in keeping with the Arafat's _ Arafat's
undertaking, that we can resume talks.
   There has been a frustration, Jim, in the Arab world that this
dialogue has not resulted in more progress, and I understand the
frustration. I don't happen to agree with it. I think things are
better because we've had the dialogue, but Israel has strongly
objected to it and some Palestinians have been, as we can clearly
see, concerned about it. But I believe that we ought to try to find
a way to get it back at some point.

<TEXT>
   Q: Mr. President _
   Q: Follow up, sir? What about the flip side of that coin, if I
might? As you grappled with this, did you worry and are you worried
now that Israel will just take this and say, ``See, we've been
right about the PLO all along,'' and _
   Bush: I'm not so troubled on that because I think they will see
here that I am not accepting the premise that there is no good to
come from talking to the PLO. So I don't worry too much about that
point.
   Q: But do you see Mr. Shamir as too hard line, as the kind of
leader who is going to say, ``Well, we were right, and therefore,
we'll stay away from _ (inaudible).''
   Bush: Well, I am hoping that's not the case, and one of the
reasons I sent him this long, lengthy letter was to make clear to
him that it is our view the peace process ought to go forward. And
it's going to be difficult for him, but it must go forward. And it
must go forward along the original _ the lines of what originally
was the Shamir plan. And then it became Mubarak got interested, and
he played a useful role in it. Then Jim Baker got involved, and has
done a heroic job in trying to get the talks going.
   So we are _ we are _ I hope that the U.S. will have a useful
role to play, regardless of the step I have taken here in the PLO,
because, as we all know, we were not proposing that the PLO be at
the table. This was a charge made against us by some of the _ some
in Israel, and that isn't _ that doesn't happen to be the case. And
I think the government knows that.
   Yes, Rita. Excuse me. I shouldn't have gotten you earlier.
   Q: Mr. President, during the campaign, you said often that we've
got to find a way that people who have children won't be threatened
with the loss of their jobs. And now you're saying that that has to
be a voluntary provision on the part of employers to give parental
leave. How does that fulfill your campaign promise for people who
work for employers who won't give voluntary leave?
   Bush: You've got to keep working for them till they do, because
my campaign promise did not go to what they call mandated benefits.
And just to be sure I was right, we looked it up again yesterday,
and _ but my position has not changed. And I see that I must
convince some Republicans as well as many Democrats that it hasn't
changed.
   Q: Do you have any point of view on how you are going to
convince these employers? Many of them say if it's not a mandatory
requirement, why should they do it.
   Bush: Well, I have a great, great faith that collective
bargaining and market forces move towards progress. And we've seen
it in the private sector, and I want to see it faster and quicker
in the private sector without burdening every business by the same
formula of mandated benefits.
   Q: Mr. President?
   Bush: Yes, Charles. Excuse me.
   Q: You specified that the PLO dialogue has been positive and
productive, but you haven't really told us in what way. Could you
be a little more specific about that? What productivity do you see
in it?
   Bush: Well, I think the very fact we are talking can _ and
that's one of the reasons I hope that it can be restored _ can
eliminate differences. And I would like to feel that the PLO,
because of our dialogue, doesn't see us as quite the hostile
country that once they did.
   And there's all kinds of small points that are taken up by our
Ambassador Pelletreau in Tunis that I think have reduced the levels
of misunderstanding. I don't want to leave you the wrong
impression, that I think the dialogue has resulted in a more
dynamic peace process. But I do think it's _ I do think that it's
good, and I think that it encourages moderation in the Palestinian
_ within the PLO ranks.
   I think the _ we lose sight of the fact that Arafat did
something that was predicted no Palestinian leader could do when he
recognized Israel's right to exist as a state. And some might say,
``Well, it's about time,'' and I'm one of them. But that was quite
a step forward.
   It was quite a step forward when he recognized Resolution 242,
and I think that was positive. And then I think we've had a chance
to solidify those gains, modest though they might have been,
through dialogue.
   But I can't point to the fact that that has really solved the
question of Middle East peace. I just feel that talking offers more
potential than stiff-arming each other. And yet, we can't digest it
as long as this _ this terroristic act _ is sticking in our throat,
and properly so, as a country that decries international terror.

   Q: Mr. President, a question about rafters here?
   Bush: The rafter's coming _ two rafter questions here.
   Q: A question about space. How serious are you about this
lunar-based Mars mission proposal? Would you go so far as to veto
the bill that contains NASA appropriations if Congress decides to
delete all the money _
   Bush: I haven't even contemplated any veto strategy. I'd like to
get what I want. I think it's in the national interest. I think
that the United States must remain way out front on science and
technology, and this broad program that I've outlined, seed money
that I've asked for, should be supported. But I'm not _ I think
it's way too early to discuss veto strategy. We've got to take one
_ took one on the chops in a House committee the other day. And
I've got to turn around now and fight for what I believe.
   Yeah _ and then over to Brit. Yeah?
   Q: Mr. President, how far will you go to protect the NASA budget
in the future? Can you remove it from HUD and give it to _
   Bush: It's pretty hard, given the way Congress functions, and
that is a function of the Congress, not of the Executive branch, to
decide under what committees these budgets are _ budgets are worked.
   But, I think it is fair to say that I will fight for a
fully-funded space program. We've put forward what I think is a
bold one. I've taken some shots saying, ``Hey, how can you propose
something this big when we have such a large deficit?'' And I
understand the question, but we're talking about stretched out _
we're talking about stretched-out financing and we're talking about
hopefully a continued dynamic economy. And between the two, we can
accommodate this goal if we all get with it.
   Brit _ up in the attic.
   Q: Was there not a need here, sir, to not appear to be indulgent
of the PLO at a time when the administration has been tougher than
perhaps any recent administration has been to Israel?
   Bush: That's not what made my decision, and I don't know that
we've been tougher. I'm the president of the United States and the
United States has a policy and I'm supposed to, I think, go forward
with our policy.
   And one of the big problems we have had is the question between
ourselves and the Israeli government is this question of
settlements. But, I don't _ I wouldn't read my decision here to go
as follows: ``He made this decision because he's concerned about a
complicated relationship with Israel at this point.'' That's not
why I made the decision.
   But, some may read it as that. But, we are _ we are staying with
our concept on the peace process and we are staying _ and are
staying with our policy on settlements. And this action that I have
taken today is consistent with our policy on anti-terror.
   Q: Mr. President.
   Bush: Yeah?
   Q: Do you feel that Israel has committed acts of terrorism (upon
Palestinians)?
   Bush: Well, we spoke out in the _ on recent _ recent violence in
the Gaza and please note my last comment to call for _ calling for
peaceful resolution to these questions as opposed to violence and
international terror. And that's the way I would respond on that.
   Q: _ why you're here in Huntsville, sir, if you are here to help
raise money for Gov. Guy Hunt's gubernatorial campaign?
   Bush: I'm not standing right here to do that, but I was downtown
doing exactly that and I hope we were successful because I am
totally committed to his re-election. I have respected the progress
the state of Alabama has made under his leadership and, as I look
at the way my philosophy of government works, the governors are
very, very important on all this.
   I cite not just the Education Summit in which I worked closely
with Guy, but this whole concept that the states and localities
have a significant role to play not just in the money end of it,
but in the whole setting of objectives and goals.
   So I'm glad you raised it and, yes, I'm here _ that part of the
trip was strongly to support him, to support other political
leaders, too.
   Q: Mr. President, are you going to appoint an Alabamian on the
TVA Board?
   Bush: Ma'am?
   Q: You have goals for your space initiative. Do you believe
Governor Hunt can help you reach some of those by being so strong
in the Tennessee Valley?
   Bush: Well, I think he's a proponent of the space program that I
have set forth. I think he's got great credibility
   with other governors. If I'm not mistaken, I think he's hosting
the National Governors down here and that'll give him an
opportunity to make the case for space or any other initiatives
for. But he is seen by other governors to know what he is talking
about in this area and clearly to be a strong proponent. So I guess
the bottom line is, yes, I think Governor Hunt here can be helpful
to our objectives of terms of a vibrant space program.
   Q: Mr. President, are you going to nominate or appoint Governor
Hunt's nominee to the TVA Board?
   Bush: Well, I don't know that I'm going to carry my enthusiasm
that far, but _ (laughter) _ he's made a strong case for a person
that he believes in and he did it in his typical way, typical of
Guy Hunt, right direct. He told me exactly why he favored a certain
nominee, and then seemed to be saying, ``Look. I recognize that you
have a lot of factors to weigh in this decision.''
   But I leave here understanding exactly why he has taken the
position he has and I leave it _ and the position has respect and
I'm not prepared to discuss further what I might or might not do in
this TVA _ you're talking about the TVA appointment.
   Q: Can you say how long it's going to take you to make an
appointment?
   Bush: A matter of days. (Laughter.)
   Reporters: Thank you.
   Bush: Thank you all very much.

<TEXT>
   Albanians will soon be entitled to hold a
passport for travel abroad under new legislation liberalizing
travel, a further sign that the country's leaders are abandoning
their longtime isolationism.
   Travel for Albania's 3 million citizens has been difficult if
not impossible for decades.
   But the Communist leadership has signaled its willingness to
increast foreign ties and grant citizens freedoms long denied under
the rigid Stalinist system imposed by the late leader Enver Hoxha.
   Under the new regulations, all Albanians age 16 and above will
be entitled to apply for a passport valid for five years, the
Albanian state news agency ATA reported Wednesday.
   ``All the citizens of ... Albania enjoy the right to be equipped
with passports for traveling abroad,'' the agency quoted Ilmi
Muharremi, the man in charge of visas and passports, as saying.
   He added, however, that this excluded ``the cases foreseen by
the decree.'' He did not elaborate on who could be denied a
passport.
   The ATA dispatch was telexed from Tirana.
   The decree on granting passports was approved last week, ATA
said. It did not give a date for the new regulations to enter into
force, but indicated it could be next month.
   Travel to Albania is also to be simplified in some cases,
Muharremi indicated. He told ATA that foreigners who have obtained
approval for their trip from Albanian authorities can get the visa
directly at the border.
   Muharremi said that 6,200 Albanians have been granted passports
and traveled abroad ``recently.'' He was not more specific.
   Albanian earlier this month pledged to adopt basic reforms and
seek full membership in the Conference on Security and Cooperation
in Europe.
   Albania is the only nation in Europe that refused to sign the
1975 Helsinki agreements on security and human rights.
   Other cautious reforms announced in recent weeks include the
abolition of the death penalty for those trying to flee the country
and acceptance of religion, officially banned for decades.
   Albanian leaders have announced they were also seeking to mend
relations with the superpowers.

<TEXT>
   Marking its six-month anniversary,
thousands of people took to the streets to protest the U.S.
invasion that helped install President Guillermo Endara.
   People calling themselves ``anti-imperialist groups'' carried
signs Wednesday saying ``Endara, what happened in Panama Dec. 20:
liberation, war or invasion?''
   Endara was installed as president when U.S. troops rolled into
Panama on that day in December and ousted former strongman Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Noriega, in jail in Miami on drug trafficking charges, anulled
elections last spring in which U.S. backed Endara won 3-1 over
Noriega's party.
   Marchers, wearing black armbands, neckerchiefs and shirts and
carrying Panamanian flags with black diagonals painted across them,
condemned the U.S. action and Endara's cooperation with it.
   Endara said he was not bothered by the peaceful protest.
   ``The fact that there are opposition protests shows ... the
democracy and liberty that Panamanians enjoy,'' he said.

   Nelson Mandela's oldest daughter says she
is excited about seeing her father as a free man but realizes she
will have to compete for his time.
   The South African anti-apartheid leader, released from prison in
February after 27 years, visits Massachusetts over the weekend as
part of a 12-day U.S. tour.
   ``I know that people will be demanding him, you know, from all
sides, so that for me it's: How much time am I going to have with
him?'' Maki Mandela, 36, said Wednesday at her University of
Massachusetts apartment.
   ``Right now it will be, you know, `Hi, we are happy you are here
and welcome.'''
   Ms. Mandela, whose full name is Makaziwe Mandela-Amuah but who
usually goes by the shorter version, last saw her father, in
prison, last summer.
   The 71-year-old Mandela is scheduled for a spate of appearances,
including a visit to the John F. Kennedy Library and a rally.
   ``To me it means a lot just having that moment, that personal
contact with him,'' Ms. Mandela said. ``This is what I long for.
This is what I missed out of my life and this is what I really
need, sort of hunger for.''
   At the same time, she said, ``It's not like he's on a tour. He's
here on business.''
   She and her half-sister, 31-year-old Zenani, are both studying
in Massachusetts. Maki Mandela, whose older brother, Makgatho,
lives in South Africa, is from her father's first marriage. Zenani
and her sister, Zindzi, 29, were born to Winnie Mandela, Mandela's
second wife. Zindzi lives in South Africa.
   ``It's difficult. Zenani looked at the schedule and she didn't
see any place for (the daughters) in the schedule and she made a
joke that those other people who wanted to see her dad should
imagine how she feels,'' said Themba Vilakazi, executive director
of the Boston-based Fund For a Free South Africa.
   ``There will be a million people and only a few hours,'' she
said.
   Maki Mandela, her husband, Isaac Amuah, also a student at UMass,
and their children, Tukwini, Dumani and Kweku, will be in Boston on
Saturday.
   ``My children are so excited. You can't (calm) them down,'' Maki
Mandela said.

<HEAD>Boycott Of Paper Exports To USSR May Affect Publication Of Pravda</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This country's paper exporters are
cutting off all shipments to the Soviet Union because they haven't
been paid _ a move that could affect the publication of Pravda and
Izvestia, Finnish television reported.
   The Soviet Communist Party paper Pravda and official government
newspaper Izvestia depend on paper from Finland.
   Their stocks of newsprint have dwindled to a week's supply
because other Western countries already have stopped paper exports
to the Soviet Union, Wednesday's report said.
   Jarl Kohler, head of the Confederation of Finnish Forest
Industries, said the Soviet Union owes Finnish paper exporters
several months in payments totaling about $22 million.
   Finland annually exports up to 400,000 tons of paper to the
Soviet Union. The trade is estimated at over $250 million.

<TEXT>
   An agency seeking corrective surgery for a
6-year-old boy born with clubfeet won a favorable ruling from the
U.S. Supreme Court, but still has to find a hospital willing to
perform the operation.
   Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor refused to set aside
lower court rulings ordering the surgery on Kou Xiong, who also was
born with a dislocated hip. The ruling was dated Tuesday, but
released Wednesday.
   The boy's parents, Hmong immigrants from Laos, oppose the
surgery because they believe spirits would punish their extended
family for tampering with the boy's deformity.
   Valley Children's Hospital in Fresno and Shriners Hospital for
Crippled Children in San Francisco have refused to perform the
operation without parental consent, said Fresno County Department
of Social Services Director Ernie Velasquez.
   Velasquez said his agency would continue searching for a
hospital that will perform the surgery, but no operations would be
scheduled until he meets with lawyers representing Ger Xiong and
his wife, Houa Vue Xiong, and Hmong community leaders.
   ``They truly believe that something bad will happen if the
surgery takes place,'' Velasquez said. ``Those beliefs are very
strong.''
   He said one way around the issue of parental consent would be
making the boy a ward of the court. ``I'm not so sure it's a good
option, but it's one of the options,'' Velasquez said.
   Dang Vang, president of Hmong American Human Rights Committee in
Fresno, said the earlier Superior Court decision was a blow to the
Hmong community's freedom of religion.
   ``I talked with the family and they are very depressed, and not
just the family, but all people across the country in the Hmong
communities,'' Vang said.
   Fresno County Judge Lawrence O'Neill ordered the operation in
February after the Social Services agency, notified by school
officials of the boy's deformity, sought such help.
   Medical testimony during a two-day hearing before O'Neill
indicated the boy would lose movement in his legs and be
wheelchair-bound by adulthood without the surgery.
   However, Velasquez said that the orthopedic surgeon considered
the key expert witness in the case says he would not perform the
surgery without parental cooperation.

<TEXT>
   West Germany plans to give Moscow more
than $3 billion in credit to support development of an open market
in the Soviet Union, a Bonn-based newspaper reported today.
   Die Welt said that the credit had been negotiated between a
consortium of banks headed by Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank with
the Soviet Union's Foreign Trade Bank.
   ``The Soviet government, as support for its efforts to develop
open market elements, will received a credit of more than 5 billion
marks ($3 billion),'' the newspaper said.
   According to Die Welt, the West German government is sponsoring
the credit and has already approved it.
   It said that ``Finance Minister Theo Waigel had discreetly
directed the negotiations and agreed to it,'' after it became clear
that the credit would be used toward developing an open market.
   According to the newspaper, the government intends this week to
present the agreement to the appropriations committee of the West
German parliament.
   The government expects the agreement to win automatic approval
from the committee, Die Welt said.

<HEAD>Fossil of Ice Age Bison Found in Mojave Desert</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists found the partial skeleton of an
Ice Age bison in the Mojave Desert, more evidence that the parched
landscape once was forested and crossed by streams, a researcher
said Wednesday.
   The discovery of the 10,700-year-old fossil in Red Rock Canyon
State Park was the first time researchers have found the partial
skeleton of a large Ice Age animal in the vast desert, said
paleontologist David Whistler, curator of the Natural History
Museum of Los Angeles County.
   Single bones of bison, mammoths, camels and horses had been
found previously, along with numerous bones of 25 other species,
including frogs, lizards, snakes, shrews, bats, a mountain gopher
and lemming-like creatures called voles, he added.
   ``The desert is no more than 10,000 years old. These fossils,
including the bison, reinforce that knowledge,'' Whistler said.
``This further confirms that the desert was once much cooler and
much wetter.''
   At the time the bison roamed the Mojave, the area was ``a
pinyon-juniper scrub forest, like what you'd find in northern
Arizona today,'' he said, adding that the types of fossilized
creatures indicate the area also had lakes and year-round cold
water streams.
   Whistler said that on May 27, a single fist-sized vertebra from
the bison was spotted in an ancient streambed in the state park by
Pam Owen, a paleontology graduate student at California State
University, Long Beach.
   Scientists then unearthed about one-third of the bison's
skeleton, which was broken in various pieces. The rest of the bison
had been exposed by erosion over the ages and had weathered away.
   ``I'm afraid Mother Nature got about two-thirds of it and we got
about one-third,'' Whistler said. ``We've got part of the chest,
part of a hip, a shoulder blade, a hind leg, and about five
isolated teeth.''
   Red Rock park officials asked Whistler not to reveal the exact
digging site, but he said it was close to State Route 14, the main
highway through the park, which is located about 100 miles north of
Los Angeles.
   The bison's worn teeth and arthritic bones show it was old when
it died, Whistler said, adding that the species went extinct and
was different than modern bison.
   Radiocarbon dating of fossil wood in the streambed near the
bison allowed scientists to determine it died about 10,700 years
ago.
   Museum spokeswoman Ellen Girardeau said the bison fossils will
be used for research and won't be displayed. They will be moved to
Los Angeles late this month.

   President Bush broke off America's
dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization Wednesday,
saying a guerrilla raid on Israel's coast ``is sticking in our
throat'' and must be renounced by Yasser Arafat for the
relationship to resume.
   ``We've given the PLO ample time to deal with this issue,'' Bush
said at a news conference at the Marshall Space Flight Center in
the midst of a day of campaigning for Republicans in Alabama and
North Carolina.
   Bush said Israeli civilians were clearly the target of the May
30 raid, for which the Palestine Liberation Front has taken
responsibility. The PLF is headed by Abul Abbas, an Arafat
associate and a member of the PLO executive committee.
   The attack was thwarted when Israeli defenders intercepted five
speedboats when they landed. Four guerrillas were killed and 12
captured. The boats, carrying 16 guerrillas armed with rockets and
machine guns, reportedly were dropped off a Libyan ship 120 miles
at sea.
   ``This terroristic act is sticking in our throat,'' Bush said,
declaring he was acting even though his decision could incite new
violence in the Mideast.
   Bush said he was willing to reopen the talks _ which enhanced
Arafat's standing in the Arab world _ if the PLO condemns the raid,
dissociates itself from the action and moves to discipline Abbas,
who Bush said, was ``the perpetrator.''
   Bush noted that the PLO did dissociate itself from the action,
but said that and a general condemnation of violence against
civilians was not enough.
   The PLO last week said:
   ``The PLO position remains unchanged. We are against any
military action that targets civilians, whatever form it may take.''
   Secertary of State James A. Baker III, who had recommended
Bush's action, told reporters flying with him to Europe for talks
on German unity that Israel still needs the acquiescence of the PLO
to find a partner for peace talks. He admitted that Bush' action
could hurt moderate Arabs.
   Without PLO consent, ``there won't be a dialogue for Israel.
They (Israeli governments) have been seeking to develop one for 22
years and none has come forward,'' Baker said before a refueling
stop at Shannon, Ireland.
   Bush's decision disrupts a relationship with the PLO started by
then-President Reagan in December 1988 after Arafat met two U.S.
conditions: he disavowed terrorism and recognized Israel's right to
exist.
   The decision comes at a time when U.S. efforts to induce Israel
to revive the Middle East peace process have run out of energy.
   Israel welcomed the administration's decision. A statement
issued by the embassy in Washington said Bush's decision ``will
encourage those Palestinians seeking peace with Israel to seize
upon this opportunity to begin a direct dialogue with Israel.''
   The League of Arab States called the suspension of the dialogue
a ``blow to peace'' and said it ``signals a penalty to Arab
moderation _ especially Palestinian moderation _ and rewards
Israeli intransigence.''
   And Faisal Husseini, one of the leading Palestinian nationalists
in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, said the United States was
``punishing the wrong people.'' Israel, he said in an interview in
Washington, was refusing to match the concessions made by the PLO.
   ``This will make the radicals and all those who oppose peace
strong,'' he said.
   Yael Dayan, daughter of the late Israeli general Moshe Dayan,
said cutting off the dialogue ``opens the doors to war.'' Ms.
Dayan, who is touring the United States with Husseini on behalf of
the Israeli Peace Now movement, said Bush's decision signals ``the
burial of a slow process that had barely begun.''
   On Capitol Hill, the speaker of the House, Rep. Thomas S. Foley,
D-Wash., said he supported Bush's decision.
   ``I think the president sought to find a way to conscientiously
continue this dialogue, but it has to be one in which conditions
which we set forth ... are respected,'' Foley said.
   Rep. William Broomfield of Michigan, the senior Republican on
the House Foreign Affairs Committee, also hailed Bush's action.
   ``America must let Arafat know that the PLO can't talk peace and
wage war at the same time,'' he said, adding:
   ``President Bush was wise to suspend rather than terminate the
talks. Arafat should know that the United States is still willing
to cooperate in the search for peace, but not under the barrel of a
gun.''
   The Reagan administration's willingness to talk directly with
the PLO had bolstered Arafat's claim to be the foremost spokesman
for Palestinians and for their goal of achieving statehood.
   The Palestine Liberation Front, which Abbas heads, is a radical
PLO faction.
   Even after the raid, contacts continued between the United
States and the PLO while the United States awaited the PLO's
response. Robert Pelletreau Jr., the U.S. ambassador to Tunisia,
met with PLO officials outside Tunis several times.
   The PLO had played an offstage role in the Bush administration's
attempt to reignite the peace process. Egypt, acting as an
intermediary, checked with the PLO as Baker put together a formula
for setting up talks in Cairo between Israel and Palestinian Arabs.
   That effort had been stalled since March, when the Israeli
coalition government collapsed.
   Bush recently wrote Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who heads the
newly formed Israeli government, in an attempt to revive the peace
process. Through Cabinet Secretary Eliakim Rubinstein, the
government in Jerusalem has promised to pursue peace with the Arabs.
   Last March, the State Department, in a report to Congress, said
the PLO was adhering to Arafat's commitment to disavow terrorism.
   Although Palestinian groups have launched nearly 30 border and
rocket attacks against Israel since the U.S.-PLO talks began, the
report said, ``We have no evidence in those cases or any others
that the actions were authorized or approved by the PLO executive
committee or by Arafat personally.''
   On other subjects in his meeting with reporters, Bush:
   _Said he has no plans for a ``bold new initiative'' to help
Mikhail Gorbachev cope with the ailing Soviet economy. He said his
administration is willing to talk with allies about helping the
Soviet Union. Some Western nations are reported to favor a costly
plan to assist Gorbachev.
   _Defended his press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, for his
comments on Tuesday critical of Democrats on the savings and loan
bailout issue. He said Fitzwater was doing no more than
``responding to a couple of shots across my bow.''
   _Said he would tell Nelson Mandela next week that American
sanctions against South Africa will remain in place until
conditions fixed under law are met. He also paid a tribute to South
African President F.W. de Klerk ``for what he's done'' to start
dismantling apartheid. ``He's come a long way,'' Bush said.

   President Bush says he's willing to
resume the newly suspended talks with the Palestine Liberation
Organization if Yasser Arafat denounces a recent foiled terrorist
attack on an Israeli beach.
   The president, who announced the suspension Wednesday, said the
PLO ``has not provided a credible account of this incident,'' in
which a PLO affiliate group launched a guerrilla attack on the
civilian-filled beach near Tel Aviv.
   ``We've given the PLO ample time to deal with this issue,'' but
PLO leader Arafat has refused to denounce it or discipline the
leader of the group, the radical Palestine Liberation Front, Bush
said at a news conference during a one-day political trip to
Alabama and North Carolina.
   The president said the administration is willing to resume the
talks if Arafat fulfills those conditions. Bush said he believes
the 18-month U.S.-PLO dialogue has encouraged moderation within the
PLO.
   ``But I can't point to the fact that that has really solved the
question of Middle East peace. I just feel that talking offers more
potential than stiff-arming each other,'' he said. ``And yet we
can't digest it as long as this terroristic act is sticking in our
throat.''
   Bush spoke during a trip to the Marshall Space Flight Center in
Huntsville on a day otherwise devoted to fund-raising for
Republican Gov. Guy Hunt in Alabama and Sen. Jesse Helms in North
Carolina.
   The president helped raise $450,000 for Hunt's bid for a second
term, and about $1 million for Helms' fight against Democrat Harvey
Gantt, aides said.
   He attacked a House Appropriations subcommittee that last week
axed $300 million from his proposal to send manned flights back to
the moon and on to Mars.
   Touching on other matters at the news conference, the president
said:
   _Parents who work for employers who do not give parental leave
time, as he urges them to do, should ``keep working for them until
they do'' because he does not believe the government should require
firms to offer such leave.
   _He has no plans to support a European move for an international
economic aid package for the Soviet Union, although he is willing
to discuss the matter with the allies.
   _His press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, acted appropriately in
lambasting Democrats for partisanship in their criticisms on the
government's massive savings and loan bailout.
   _Said he would tell Nelson Mandela next week that American
sanctions against South Africa will remain in place until
conditions fixed under law are met. He also paid a tribute to South
African President F.W. de Klerk for steps toward dismantling
apartheid. ``He's come a long way,'' Bush said.
   On the PLO question, the president said the evidence shows that
civilians clearly were the target of the May 30 terrorist attempt,
in which the perpetrators were intercepted by Israeli military
forces before they could harm anyone. Four guerrillas were killed
and 12 captured.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who recommended the
suspension, defended the decision even while admitting it would
hurt moderate Arabs. ``We really could not let our pursuit of peace
stand in the way of our commitment to fight terrorism,'' Baker said
while en route to East Berlin for German reunification talks.
   The U.S. talks with the PLO began in 1988 after Arafat complied
with U.S. conditions that he renounce terrorism and back the right
of Israel to exist.
   The PLO last week insisted that it opposes ``any military action
that targets civilians.'' But Bush said Wednesday that that generic
statement is not enough, and he expects a specific condemnation of
the May 30 action.
   Israel praised the president in a statement from its embassy in
Washington, saying his decision will encourage Palestinians who
want peace ``to seize upon this opportunity to begin a direct
dialogue with Israel.''
   The League of Arab States, however, said Bush's suspension of
the talks ``signals a penalty to Arab moderation _ especially
Palestinian moderation _ and rewards Israeli intransigence.''
   Yael Dayan, daughter of the late Israeli general Moshe Dayan,
said cutting off the dialogue ``opens the doors to war.'' Ms.
Dayan, who is touring the United States for the Israeli Peace Now
movement, lamented ``the burial of a slow process that had barely
begun.''
   On Capitol Hill, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., backed
Bush's move, saying ``the president sought to find a way to
conscientiously continue this dialogue, but it has to be one in
which conditions which we set forth ... are respected.''

<HEAD>North Dakota's Last Abortion Doctor Retires</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   No one wants to be the abortion doctor in
North Dakota.
   The only doctor in the state who performed abortions retired
earlier this year. None of the state's 1,200 doctors has come
forward to take the place of Dr. Robert Lucy, a obstetrician and
gynecologist. He predicts no one will.
   ``Peer pressure from colleagues is the main reason,'' said Lucy,
who practiced in Jamestown, 100 miles west of here. ``They're also
afraid of public pressure.''
   Abortions still are performed at a women's clinic in Fargo, but
it has to fly doctors in from neighboring Minnesota.
   Women in the western part of the state must drive up to 350
miles to Fargo, on the state's eastern side. Some have driven all
night in bad weather.
   The distance adds to hurdles this conservative, mostly rural
state has put up to restrict abortions.
   In North Dakota, a minor seeking an abortion must have the
consent of both parents or a judge. The state allows no public
financing for abortions and prohibits abortions at public hospitals.
   ``Our patients are pretty persistent,'' said Jane Bovard,
director of the women's clinic, which operates out of a white
clapboard house on a quiet city street. ``They've made up their
mind and they get here no matter what.''
   A 21-year-old patient who did not want to give her name said she
was getting an abortion because she has a 4-year-old child, is
getting divorced and is on welfare.
   ``I want to go to school,'' she said. ``Maybe it's selfish of
me, I don't know. But if I go to school I can provide my child with
a better life.''
   The clinic, owned by the National Women's Health Organization,
performs abortions twice a week. Last year, it performed 1,308, or
about 25 a week. This year, it is averaging about 36 a week, Bovard
said. The cost is $275 to $300.
   After years of picketing outside Lucy's clinic, abortion foes
were thrilled when he announced his retirement. They hope the Fargo
clinic will go next.
   ``I believe God is closing down the centers in North Dakota, and
he'll close this one, too,'' said Aletha Schommer, one of a handful
of protesters outside the clinic last week.
   Schommer, who drove four hours from her home in Munich to join
the pickets, shouted, ``Mother, don't kill your baby!' at women
entering the clinic. She seemed unperturbed by the angry gestures
with which some women responded.
   ``By coming here, I've become a more loving person,'' she said.
``We don't want to personally harm them. We just want them to
stop.''
   Inside the clinic, a man who brought his 16-year-old daughter
for an abortion was angry at the protesters. He refused to identify
himself.
   ``You can believe whatever you want (about abortion) until it
happens to your family,'' he said. ``Then you've got to make a
decision, and it's not easy.''
   ``And then to have people screaming at you _ what kind of people
would do that?'' he added.
   Bovard said anti-abortion activists are fooling themselves if
they think they can close the clinic, which opened in 1981.
   ``I know what we do is within the law,'' she said. ``The crazy
things these people do out front here will hang them eventually.''
   Lucy said the protesters had no bearing on his decision to
retire after 42 years of practicing medicine.
   ``I felt I performed a service,'' he said. ``If they wanted to
carry a pregnancy to term, I could take care of it. If they wanted
to terminate it, I could still take care of it. So they had a
choice. That's why I did it.''

   A free trade pact between the United States
and Mexico would create a market of 400 million North American
consumers and, supporters say, put more goods on shelves all over
the continent.
   But some union leaders are asking who will get the additional
money to buy those goods.
   President Bush and President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico
agreed earlier this month to talk about a free trade agreement like
the one between the United States and Canada.
   But the heads of the largest unions in Canada and the United
States argue that an agreement with Mexico would push wages down in
the two other countries.
   ``U.S. trade and investment with Mexico has already
significantly harmed the domestic manufacturing sector,'' said Lane
Kirkland, president of the AFL-CIO. Kirkland and Shirley Carr, head
of the Canadian Labor Congress, voiced their opposition to the pact
during a recent visit with Bush.
   ``Tens of thousands of American workers have lost their jobs or
seen employment opportunities vanish as U.S. companies move to take
advantage of the poverty of Mexican workers,'' Kirkland said.
   The average U.S. worker in manufacturing earns $14.50 an hour
and the average Canadian not much less. The average Mexican gets
only $1.90.
   Under a free trade accord, a U.S. auto manufacturer could make
parts much more cheaply in Mexico than in the United States or
Canada. The result: more jobs in Mexico and fewer jobs up north
where the manufacturer sells a lot more vehicles.
   ``That could happen in the short run,'' acknowledged Claude
Barfild, who worked for the U.S. trade representative under
President Reagan. ``But in the longer run both stockholders and
workers will get the money. Mexicans who make auto parts will be
able to ask _ and get _ higher wages.''
   Since the 1940s, he said, wages in countries that export to the
United States have been rising toward American levels. Wages in
some European countries are higher than here, said Barfild, a
fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative
research group on public policy.
   The wage question was discussed last week at the first
congressional hearing on the proposed pact with Mexico. Witnesses
said a major purpose of the pact would be to encourage investors
from the United States and elsewhere to put factories in Mexico
rather than in low-wage countries on other continents.
   ``A North American trade alliance of the U.S., Canada and Mexico
will allow us to better compete with other emerging trading blocs
in Europe and Asia, and maintain our competitiveness around the
globe,'' said Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz. ``A trading bloc from the
Yukon to the Yucatan, with upwards of 400 million in population,
would be the most powerful in the world.''
   Rudiger Dornbusch, who teaches economics at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, said manufacturers would in any case build
factories where wages are low _ in Mexico, Asia, Africa or Europe.
   ``The right question to ask about free trade with Mexico is
whether we should prefer that when jobs do go abroad that they go
south rather than to Asia,'' he said.

   A 12-year-old Maryland boy who suffered
third-degree burns in a firecracker accident warns other children
not to play with pyrotechnics.
   ``I just want to say don't play with firecrackers,'' said
Vincent Baxter of Upper Marlboro, Md., describing how two months
ago a firecracker he lighted and tossed ricocheted back at him and
set his clothing on fire.
   ``It caught another firecracker on fire,'' he said. ``Then it
started sprinkling flames and sparks everywhere and caught my leg
on fire.''
   The boy's admonition came Wednesday during a Consumer Product
Safety Commission demonstration on the dangers of fireworks.
   The agency warned consumers that Fourth of July celebrations can
be marred by tragedy if precautions aren't taken to avoid the burns
and injuries caused by improper or illegal use of the devices.
   Stephen E. Higgins, director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms, also warned in a statement that dangerous explosives
are often peddled illegally to Independence Day celebrants.
   Using dolls set on fire, exploding furnishings and food and
punctured plywood shelving, the CPSC showed how an estimated 6,300
injuries _ including burns, disfigurement, loss of eyes, fingers,
hands and other limbs _ were associated with fireworks in 1989.
   ``We know that some 10,000 Americans, most of them adolescents
and teenagers, will end up in hospital emergency rooms this year
from injuries associated with fireworks,'' said CPSC Chairwoman
Jacqueline Jones-Smith.
   ``I can guarantee you that those injuries could have been
prevented,'' said Commissioner Anne Graham. She said parents should
forego their own fireworks and take children to community fireworks
displays by professionals.
   ``Fireworks by their very nature are dangerous,'' said the
commission.

<HEAD>House Tells Conferees to Accept Social Security Provision</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House is overwhelmingly recommending an
increase in Social Security benefits for some working elderly
recipients, telling its negotiators to accept that Senate-approved
provision in a child care bill.
   The House voted 384-36 Wednesday for a non-binding motion to
instruct its conferees on the bill. It acted despite warnings by
opponents that the benefit increases for working retirees would
come at the expense of new programs.
   ``It means a difficult choice between generations,'' said Rep.
Thomas Downey, D-N.Y., a leading sponsor of the child care bill.
   The vote came as the measure appeared to become more deeply
mired in legislative disagreement.
   Bills establishing major new child care programs and expanding
others, including the Head Start program, have followed a tortuous
path leading to House and Senate approval of far different packages.
   The measures remain in two Senate-House conference committees
created to resolve those differences, and one of the panels earlier
this week produced a preliminary agreement on several provisions.
That plan would keep the Senate's plan for a new categorical block
grant child care program, instead of the House version's expansion
of entitlement programs.
   That agreement appeared to run counter to House wishes. The
chamber voted 411-0 on May 9 not to instruct conferees not to
accept those Senate provisions on the main elements of a child care
bill.
   The House on Wednesday pointed to that vote and delivered a
direct rebuke to its own conferees. It voted 416-0 on a second
non-binding motion reaffirming its opposition to the Senate version.
   Members said that accepting the Senate's provisions would prompt
President Bush's veto as well as lose important House support.
   Neither vote binds the conferees, but they amount to recorded
expressions of the chamber's sentiment.
   The motion on Social Security instructs the conferees to modify
and accept the Senate's rider, allowing people 65 to 69 years old
to earn more money through working while continuing to receive
their retirement benefits.
   Rep. Hank Brown, R-Colo., said it would relieve ``a devastating
penalty'' that Social Security recipients must pay for continuing
to work, often part time.
   Opponents said the change in Social Security policy has no place
in a child care bill and should await congressional budget talks
with the White House and other panels deliberating Social Security
changes.
   ``It would be truly unfortunate if we forgot that we are here to
provide help to children who would otherwise be left alone,'' said
Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee.
   The provision added by the Senate would raise the annual
earnings limitation for Social Security recipients by $1,200, to
$10,560. For those earning up to $5,000 beyond that, Social
Security benefits would be reduced by $1 for every $4 earned.
   Brown recommended altering the Senate's provision by delaying
the change in benefit reduction and recalculating lump-sum payments
in the awarding of back benefits for some Social Security
recipients. This in effect would reduce one benefit to pay for
increasing another.
   The House Budget Committee chairman, Rep. Leon Panetta,
D-Calif., estimated the bill's cost at $1.5 billion to $2.4
billion. But Brown said the lump-sum reduction would produce more
than enough money to pay for the increase in the earnings
limitation.
   ``It has no effect at all on child care,'' Brown said. ``It in
no way limits or restricts the funds available for child care.''

<HEAD>Possible Record Year for Farm Income on Tap</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's shaping up as a possible record year for
farm income, according to new forecasts by the Agriculture
Department.
   Sales of farm commodities ``are showing some unexpected
strength, so income prospects have brightened'' since the last 1990
forecast was issued three months ago, the department's Economic
Research Service said Wednesday.
   ``Strong hog prices and firming coarse grain prices are behind
the improvement,'' the report said. Coarse grains include corn,
sorghum, oats and barley.
   Overall, the ``net cash income'' of farmers was forecast at $55
billion to $59 billion this year, up $1 billion from the range
indicated since March. Last year's net cash income was about $54
billion, and the record was $57.2 billion in 1988.
   As used by the agency, net cash income ``measures the value of
commodities sold in a calendar year plus government payments, less
out-of-pocket costs.'' Some commodities sold actually may have been
produced in earlier years and stored until marketed.
   Direct government payments to farmers in 1990 are expected to
drop about 15 percent from last year to a range of $8 billion to
$10 billion, the report said.
   In another method of accounting, the report said ``net farm
income'' may be in the range of $47 billion to $51 billion, a $2
billion increase from the earlier 1990 forecast. Last year's was
$49 billion, a record.
   Net farm income is used to measure the value of agricultural
production, whether sold or stored, in a calendar year plus
government payments, minus all costs, including depreciation and
other allowances.
   The report said world wheat production is expected to exceed
consumption in 1990-91, leading to the first increase in stockpiles
in four years. However, supplies of corn and other coarse gains
probably will drop for the fourth straight year, despite larger
output this year.
   ``So wheat prices are slipping, while coarse grain prices are
expected to remain firm'' the report said. ``Wheat will figure more
prominently in livestock feeds as producers try to hold down
costs.''
   In the United States, unusually heavy rains have slowed the
planting of corn, soybeans and rice this spring, meaning that some
farmers will switch to soybeans and sorghum.
   Looking at the rural economy, the report said unemployment in
the first quarter was unchanged from a year earlier at 6.6 percent,
after declining in rural areas for four years.
   ``Rural areas are expected to see more moderate job growth and
stable unemployment rates for the rest of the year,'' the report
said. ``And rural jobless rates probably will remain above urban
rates. Over half of all farmers now hold off-farm jobs.''

   The Agriculture Department says egg producers
will vote next month on whether to eliminate refunds permanently
under a federal research and promotion program.
   Daniel D. Haley, administrator of the department's Agricultural
Marketing Service, said Wednesday that ballots will be mailed by
July 16 to all producers of record.
   All commercial egg producers owning more than 30,000 laying hens
during the period Jan. 1 through March 31, 1990, except those who
produce mostly hatching eggs, will be eligible to vote.
   In 1988, Congress amended the Egg Research and Consumer
Information Act to suspend refunds for 18 months beginning Jan. 1,
1989, pending results of a national referendum.
   For the new provision to be adopted, approval would have to come
from at least two-thirds of those voting this summer, or a majority
of producers representing at least two-thirds of the volume of eggs
produced by all voters.
   If adopted, producers will continue to pay mandatory,
non-refundable assessments of five cents per 30-dozen case of
commercial eggs to the American Egg Board for research, promotion
and consumer education programs.
   Exemptions would continue for producers with flocks of 30,000 or
fewer hens, and for all egg producers in Alaska and Hawaii.
   Currently, the assessments raise about $7.2 million annually,
the agency said.

   Recent surveys show that almost 20 percent of
the farmers who bought federal crop insurance did so in order to
obtain loans.
   The Agriculture Department said Wednesday that the surveys were
for crop insurance bought in the 1988-89 season.
   ``Of those who said they had to buy the insurance before getting
a loan, almost half dealt with commercial banks,'' the department's
Economic Research Service said in its report.
   Roughly another one-third borrowed from the Farmers Home
Administration, and one out of seven from the Farm Credit System.
   ``Farmers were more likely to say they had to buy the insurance
if they borrowed primarily from one source,'' the report said.

<HEAD>FAA to Closely Watch `Celebrity Airline'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal aviation officials say they will
closely watch operations of a charter air service that was allowed
to resume flying last month after being shut down for safety
violations.
   The operation _ nicknamed ``Celebrity Airline'' because it
carried rock stars, politicians and other well-known passengers _
came under intense scrutiny during a two-day congressional hearing
that ended Wednesday.
   Tony Broderick, head of regulation and certification for the
Federal Aviation Administration, said Northeast Jet, operating as
Personal Jet Services, met rigorous FAA qualifications to gain a
new certificate.
   The FAA pulled the Allentown, Pa., airline's operating
certificate in September 1988, accusing the service of overworking
its pilots, skimping on training and keeping two sets of
maintenance records: one for its own use and one for FAA inspectors.
   The owners denied the allegations but decided to seek a new
certification a year later rather than appeal.
   The House Public Works investigations subcommittee has been
looking into FAA oversight of Northeast Jet and the 3,000 other
U.S. air charter and taxi services that carry more than 8 million
passengers a year.
   The hearings focused on Northeast Jet because its owner had
managed to get a new certification after being shut down for safety
violations. Some lawmakers accused the FAA of having a ``revolving
door policy'' of recertifying airlines whose licenses are pulled.
   Broderick testified that the case was unusual and that
revocation of a flight certificate was ``usually a death sentence
for an airline.''
   He said FAA inspectors would pay especially close attention to
Private Jet, which has only been operating for a few weeks and has
only one plane, because of its previous violations.
   ``We often apply extra surveillance to carriers who have
received a new certificate after having a certificate previously
revoked,'' Broderick said.
   He said 100 small airlines have been shut down because of safety
problems over the last five years.
   No special preference is given carriers that try to reapply for
certification after being shut down for a year or more, Broderick
said.
   The FAA does not have the power to permanently ban a company
from flying but must re-evaluate it based on operations when it
files a new application, he said.
   Northeast Jet gained the nickname ``Celebrity Airlines'' after
flying clients such as first ladies Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush,
presidential hopefuls Michael Dukakis and Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan.,
and pop singers Billy Idol, Bruce Springsteen and Barry Manilow.
   Company President Earl Holtz said he would carry anyone who
pays, but his lawyer, Mark Kahan, said most passengers are business
travelers.

<TEXT>
   The Pentagon is appealing to Congress to
extend special benefits and severance pay to active-duty enlisted
personnel who will be forced out as the armed services grow smaller.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney sent to Congress on Wednesday a
proposal that would provide separation pay for enlisted men and
women in uniform with at least five years' service.
   ``This benefit will be particularly important to those
non-commissioned officers who don't serve long enough to retire,
but who nevertheless have dedicated a big part of their working
lives to the nation's service,'' Cheney said in a statement.
   Currently, separation pay is only given to active-duty officers
and reserve enlisted personnel who have served for at least five
years. The payment is based on a year's base pay.
   Under the defense secretary's plan, the separation pay would be
10 percent of the base pay times the number of years of service.
   The Pentagon envisions cutting the size of the
2.1-million-member active-duty force by at least 90,000 in the next
two years, although further budget reductions could raise that
number.
   While Cheney made his appeal, his senior enlisted advisers urged
lawmakers to adopt legislation that would help ease the impact of
significant cuts in the defense budget.
   Recent debate over reductions in President Bush's $303.3 billion
budget has focused on Air Force fighter wings, Army divisions, Navy
ships and base closings.
   But the Pentagon advisers, testifying before the Senate Armed
Services subcommittee on manpower and personnel, put the reductions
in personal terms.
   ``Spouses and even some of the children are becoming uneasy with
the future outlook,'' Sgt. Maj. of the Army Julius W. Gates told
the panel.
   Duane Bushey, master chief petty officer of the Navy, said the
overriding concern among enlisted sailors let go after more than
five years on the job is not an improvement in their education
benefits but enough separation pay.
   ``At that point they're looking to survive. They want to put
meat and potatoes on the table. Most with a family are looking to
feed the family,'' Bushey said.
   Gates said Army personnel ``are not asking for free handouts or
welfare.''
   Last month, Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and William Cohen,
R-Maine, introduced legislation that would ease the pain for
military personnel from the cuts in defense spending.
   The bill is a package of severance pay, health benefits and
relocation and job counseling for those forced out of the service
with more than seven years experience and before they are eligible
for retirement.
   The current Pentagon system caps the severance pay at $30,000.
The Senate legislation would increase the limit to $83,500.
   ``We have a personnel crisis of nearly unprecedented
proportions,'' McCain said at the hearing.
   Later in the day, Senate and House Democrats introduced
legislation that will assist the nation's communities that have
been dependent on the defense buildup of the 1980s as they adjust
to reduced military spending.
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., touted the
measure as a plan ``to move our economy from a Cold War footing to
a new era of vitality.''
   The bill would create a high-level federal office to assist
defense adjustment, provide grants to communities to start
adjustment planning and require advance notification to
communities, workers and businesses of planned cuts.

   President Bush says he wants to cooperate with
Democrats in Congress to clean up the savings and loan mess, but
he's also endorsing remarks from his spokesman singling out
Democrats for criticism.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater had gone on the
offensive Tuesday, inviting reporters to examine the contributions
to the crisis of specific Democrats.
   ``Marlin, properly, seeing a couple of shots across my bow from
certain distinguished members of the United States Senate, decided
not to acquiesce in those attacks without some response. What he
did was appropriate,'' Bush said Wednesday.
   The spokesman had singled out for criticism Sens. Donald W.
Riegle Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the Senate Banking Committee;
Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., and Bob Kerrey, D-Neb.; former House
Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas; and former Reps. Tony Coelho,
D-Calif., and Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I.
   However, Bush told reporters at the Marshall Space Flight Center
in Huntsville, Ala., ``What I'm trying to do is not respond to
individuals and to simply keep moving forward on this process.''
   He conceded that ``a spark seemed to be ignited'' by Fitzwater's
comments, but added, ``I think more important than continuing to
pour fuel on the spark is to work cooperatively with the Congress
in trying to get this mess solved.''
   The president defended his administration's pursuit of S&amp;L
fraud, saying, ``There has been an active prosecution under way.''
He said ``impressive numbers'' of cases were being pursued and ``I
expect we'll see plenty more.''
   Meanwhile, the House voted 420-1 Wednesday to provide the
Justice Department with $75 million to fight white-collar crime in
financial institutions during the 1991 fiscal year, beginning Oct.
1. At the administration's request, Congress had provided $50
million for 1990, an amount Democrats said was inadequate.
   Democratic criticism of Bush's management of the S&amp;L bailout has
been growing since last month, when the administration said
Congress would have to provide a second bailout of $30 billion to
$50 billion later this year.
   Public Citizen's Congress Watch, an organization affiliated with
consumer activist Ralph Nader, issued a report Wednesday
criticizing the administration's ``anemic'' efforts to prosecute
S&amp;L fraud.
   The report estimated that the government's civil and criminal
actions have recovered only $300 million in S&amp;L losses. That is
less than 2 percent of the $16.3 billion in losses attributed to
fraud among the 440 S&amp;Ls seized by the government since early last
year, the group said.
   ``The Bush administration's efforts to pursue and punish S&amp;L
fraud have been anemic at best, irresponsible at worst,'' said
Sherry Ettleson, an attorney who prepared the report.
   Congress Watch said the Justice Department is pursuing 891 cases
actively, compared with a backlog of 6,993 cases. Yet, the
department has added fewer than half the 425 additional agents
requested by the FBI and only 118 of the 231 assistant U.S.
attorneys requested by the department's field offices, it said.
   The group recommended that the administration spend more on
pursuing fraud, turn its attention to accountants and lawyers who
aided S&amp;L executives in committing fraud and drop its support of
legislation that would remove the threat of triple damages from
civil racketeering suits.
   It said Congress should enact legislation that would permit
whistle-blowers to bring suit against alleged S&amp;L criminals on
behalf of the government and share in the damages if fraud is found
to have occurred.

   Convicted drug dealer Charles Lewis got a
``sweet deal'' from the government in exchange for damaging
testimony that Mayor Marion Barry staged a cover-up of his own
cocaine use, Barry's lawyer contends.
   Defense attorney R. Kenneth Mundy said Wednesday that Lewis'
testimony is influenced by the fact that he still hopes to get a
Justice Department recommendation of leniency when he is sentenced
for a drug conviction in his native Virgin Islands.
   ``If you testify to exonerate the mayor ... you wouldn't get
that letter'' of leniency, Mundy stated flatly during Lewis' second
day of testimony in Barry's cocaine and perjury trial in U.S.
District Court.
   ``My testimony isn't to convict the mayor,'' Lewis insisted. He
said he is simply trying to testify ``completely and truthfully.''
   Lewis acknowledged that he didn't start cooperating with the
government until he was convicted in the Virgin Islands drug case
in 1989. But he insisted that the agreement with the government
``wasn't like a present.''
   Lewis recently was released from prison after serving seven
months on two drug-related charges. Perjury charges have been
dropped.
   ``You got a pretty sweet deal, didn't you?'' said Mundy.
   ``I don't have anything to measure it by,'' Lewis replied.
   ``Except self-preservation,'' the lawyer suggested.
   Lewis testified that he and Barry smoked crack cocaine on four
occasions in December 1988 at Lewis' hotel room. Lewis said that an
hour after Barry brought a crack pipe to the room and smoked crack
there, Lewis found out from a Washington Post reporter that he was
under suspicion by police for involvement with drugs.
   In a telephone call later in the day, Lewis and Barry agreed
Lewis would tell police the same thing he had told the reporter:
that there were no drugs in Lewis' room and that neither the mayor
nor Lewis used any drugs.
   ``Did you and Mr. Barry talk about what you were going to tell
the police?'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Judith Retchin asked.
   ``Yes,'' Lewis replied.
   ``What was your understanding?'' Retchin asked.
   ``I would tell the police the same thing I told the Post
reporter,'' replied Lewis.
   ``The truth or a lie?'' Retchin asked.
   ``I told the Post reporter a lie and therefore I would be
telling the police a lie,'' Lewis testified.
   In a later phone conversation with Barry, Lewis said he was
concerned about a possible drug test the police might administer
when he went in for an interview.
   He said he asked Barry if there was anything he could he do to
get the drugs out of his system.
   ``He said `yes,''' Lewis recalled. ``Lemon juice and lots of
water.''
   Retchin asked Lewis what he did.
   ``I used a considerable amount of lemon juice and lots of
water,'' he replied as the courtroom erupted in laughter.
   Lewis said he lied to the police and later to a federal grand
jury. Barry also testified to the grand jury, saying he and Lewis
hadn't ever exchanged cocaine and that he didn't know of any
involvement by Lewis with drugs.
   Those statements form the basis of the three felony counts of
perjury against Barry. The three-term mayor also is accused of one
misdemeanor count of conspiracy and nine counts of cocaine
possession.
   At one point Wednesday, Barry bantered with reporters about
Lewis and other government witnesses who will testify against him.
   ``The canaries are singing,'' the mayor quipped.
   ``A whole flock of them,'' one reporter responded.
   ``Yeah, they're coming in droves,'' Barry agreed with a smile.

<HEAD>Ethics Committee Members Split Over Punishment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of the House ethics committee
reportedly are deeply split over how severely to punish Rep. Barney
Frank for his ties to a male prostitute and how soon to bring the
matter to a vote.
   Those who favor a light sanction against the Massachusetts
Democrat are pushing for a vote next week after months of deadlock
face strong opposition from panel members seeking a tougher
penalty, congressional sources said Wednesday.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
committee of six Democrats and six Republicans could find itself
with a 6-6 split on the punishment question. The tie could be
mostly, but not totally, along partisan lines.
   A mild punishment for Frank would be a letter from the committee
criticizing his behavior. More serious would be a vote by the full
House to either reprimand, censure or expel Frank, one of Congress'
most outspoken liberals.
   Any mild sanction approved by the panel, formally the Committee
on Standards of Official Conduct, is almost certain to be
challenged on the floor in an attempt to upgrade the punishment.
   The committee will meet next Tuesday and Wednesday. Through
months of stalemate, the panel has found it extremely difficult to
deal with a member's personal behavior rather than his official
actions.
   While there typically is vigorous debate in the committee's
closed meetings in such investigations, the final decision is
usually unanimous.
   But two sources said Democratic members favoring a milder
punishment no longer want to wait for unanimity and believe the
case should be settled before the July 4 recess.
   One of these sources, who favors action next week, said, ``We've
investigated everything. There's not a lot more to do than decide
it.''
   One consideration is whether Frank violated the House's
catch-all Rule 43, Clause 1, which says ``A member, officer or
employee of the House of Representatives shall conduct himself at
all times in a manner which shall reflect creditably on the House
of Representatives.''
   A floor debate is almost certain because Rep. William E.
Dannemeyer, R-Calif., has promised to push for an expulsion
resolution and others reportedly will introduce resolutions for
reprimand or censure.
   Reprimand and censure both require a resolution criticizing a
member, but censure forces him to stand before his colleagues as
the content is read.
   Frank has acknowledged hiring prostitute Stephen L. Gobie for
sex in 1985.
   The lawmaker, an acknowledged homosexual, said he subsequently
hired Gobie as an aide and driver and paid him with personal funds.
   Gobie has said he used Frank's former Capitol Hill apartment for
a prostitution ring, with the lawmaker's knowledge. Frank strongly
denied knowing of the illicit business.
   Some parts of the case center on Frank's official duties. Gobie
said the two men had sex in the House gymnasium. And he contended
that Frank invoked congressional privilege to waive parking tickets
incurred by Gobie while using Franks's car to keep appointments for
illicit sex.
   Frank said he fired Gobie in August 1987 after learning of the
prostitution ring. The lawmaker denied the sex-in-the-gym
allegation and said he asked for the waiver of parking tickets
incurred only while the car was used for official House business.

<HEAD>Pentagon Said to Want Tripling of Star Wars Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pentagon planners want to triple spending on
the Star Wars antimissile system over the next six years, a Senate
panel chairman says.
   Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., said Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's
internal budget planning documents show a projected spending total
of $58 billion for the 1992-97 period for Star Wars, known
officially as the Strategic Defense Initiative, or SDI.
   ``The average of $10 billion a year that the secretary is
requesting is far, far above what we have ever provided in previous
years, even in years when we didn't have a budget crunch,'' said
Exon, chairman of the Senate Armed Services subcommittee on
strategic forces and nuclear deterrence.
   Charles M. Herzfeld, director of defense research and
engineering at the Pentagon, told Exon at a hearing Wednesday that
he could not discuss the budget figure openly because it was
classified.
   Star Wars research is aimed at developing non-nuclear weapons,
radars and sensors based in space and on the ground to detect and
shoot down ballistic missiles. The total cost is estimated at
between $55 billion and $140 billion.
   Herzfeld and other Pentagon officials testified that greatly
increased spending on SDI was justified despite the waning threat
of a superpower war.
   ``While the nature and scope of the threats we face are
changing, we find that strategic defenses can provide a unique and
vital contribution to our defense posture,'' said Stephen J.
Hadley, assistant defense secretary for international security
policy.
   The current SDI budget is $3.5 billion, and the figure has
averaged $3.3 billion over the past five years. The Bush
administration is requesting $4.6 billion for the coming fiscal
year, which begins Oct. 1, but Congress is expected to cut that
sharply.
   Exon said he supports SDI, which was launched by former
President Reagan in 1983, but sees no way Congress will approve any
increases in spending for it.
   ``I'm sitting on the realistic side of the table,'' Exon told
Lt. Gen. George L. Monahan Jr., director of the Pentagon office
that administers SDI.
   Monahan, who is retiring at the end of the month, said
substantial increases in SDI spending will be necessary if the
Pentagon is to meet President Bush's goal of deciding by 1993
whether to deploy a ballistic missile defense.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Pushing Columbus Dollar Coin</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   If 29 senators have their way, gold-colored,
11-sided dollar coins commemorating Christopher Columbus will soon
be jingling in Americans' pockets.
   However, the Bush administration and the congressional General
Accounting Office say the coins will simply occupy space in
government vaults unless Congress simultaneously moves to end the
availability of dollar bills.
   The government could save an average of $381 million a year by
minting dollar coins, L. Nye Stevens of the GAO told the Senate
Banking Committee on Wednesday.
   But, he warned, ``We think these savings are unlikely to occur
unless Congress and the administration jointly resolve not only to
eliminate the dollar note but also stand up to a negative public
reaction that should be fully anticipated.''
   Stevens said Australia, Canada, Japan, Britain and other
European nations succeeded in introducing high-denomination coins
only after they eliminated the corresponding paper bills.
   Donna V. Pope, director of the U.S. Mint, pointed to the Susan
B. Anthony dollar coin, minted in 1979 and 1980, as an object
lesson. About 425 million of the coins, half of the total struck,
are still sitting in U.S. Mint and Federal Reserve vaults.
   Nevertheless, Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., and 28 cosponsors are
offering legislation authorizing the Columbus dollar, which would
be slightly larger than a quarter and be 90 percent copper. It
would not eliminate the dollar bill.
   Domenici, who represents a copper-producing state, conceded that
some Americans are reluctant to change. But he said his dollar coin
would win acceptance because its color and shape would clearly
differentiate it from other coins.
   Anyone who rides a city bus, purchases a Sunday newspaper from a
machine or makes long-distance calls from a pay phone will
recognize the convenience of carrying a few dollar coins rather
than a pocket full of quarters, he said.
   ``Due to inflation, the $1 bill today buys about what a quarter
purchased in 1950,'' Domenici said.
   Taxpayers will save money, he added. The government currently
prints 3.2 billion dollar bills a year at an average cost of 2.6
cents. Dollar coins would cost 6 cents each, but they would last 20
or more years in contrast with the 16-month life of the average
greenback, Domenici said.
   Commercial banks are opposing Domenici's bill and a similar one
introduced in the House by Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., who unlike
Domenici would phase out dollar bills.
   The American Bankers Association says it would cost more for
financial institutions to handle and transport dollar coins, which
would weigh 17 pounds per 1,000, as opposed to bills, which weigh 3
pounds per 1,000.

<HEAD>Striking Drivers Agree to Avoid Picket Line Abuses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Striking Greyhound drivers say they will obey
a government cease-and-desist order not to shout ``vile epithets''
at replacement workers or wave threatening signs at them.
   A National Labor Relations Board order also prohibits the
strikers from firing guns, throwing firebombs, playing ``cat and
mouse'' with buses or making throat-slashing motions at
strikebreakers.
   ``This will put the full force and authority of the federal
government to work in our campaign to stop the violence against
Greyhound Lines,'' the bus line's vice president, Anthony Lannie,
said Wednesday.
   The company called the NLRB order a major development in the
3{-month-old strike.
   But union officials shrugged off its significance, noting they
have not admitted any part of the dozens of shootings or
rock-throwing incidents that have taken place during the drivers'
strike.
   ``We don't believe there's that kind of conduct going on act
this time, and furthermore, we don't believe the union is behind
it,'' said Earle Putnam, an attorney for the Amalgamated Transit
Union.
   ``We consented to this because we never condoned nor encouraged
nor ratified any violence. This says we will not do what the law
says we cannot do and which we never did in the first place,''
Putnam said.
   The NLRB approved the order on Tuesday, but it is agency policy
not to publicly announce it until both parties receive it.
   Most of the shootings occurred during the first two months of
the strike, but Greyhound officials say assaults and intimidating
acts are still occurring. The bus line, which filed for bankruptcy
two weeks ago, has been operating with 3,200 replacement drivers it
hired.
   The order stems from an unfair labor practice complaint the NLRB
filed against the union more than a month ago over violence in the
strike.
   The NLRB has also filed charges against Greyhound for attempting
to implement a contract before an impasse in negotiations had
occurred; the company is appealing that charge.
   Rather than appeal the violence-related complaint, the transit
union, which represents the 6,300 drivers who walked out March 2
over wages and job security, agreed to the cease-and-desist order.
   If violent or harassing acts can be traced back to union
leaders, they will be subject to contempt of court charges and
stiff fines.
   Specifically, the NLRB's order prohibits union drivers from:
   _Playing ``cat and mouse'' games with buses by shining lights at
the vehicles or braking right in front of them.
   _Throwing rocks, concrete, bricks, bottles, cans, eggs, coffee,
milk, oil, or transmission fluid at buses or replacement drivers.
   _Spitting on replacement workers.
   _Engaging in industrial sabotage, such as breaking bus doors,
mirrors or windshield wipers; throwing or setting off firebombs,
firecrackers and other devices at or near Greyhound terminals or
garages.
   _Placing nails or glass in terminal driveways.
   _Picketing in mass so as to block terminal driveways.
   _Shouting ``vile epithets'' at strikebreakers or verbally
threatening them or their families.
   _Displaying signs with pictures of coffins or hangmen's nooses
aimed at intimidating replacement workers or brandishing baseball
bats.
   _Making shooting, throat-slashing or hanging motions at
replacement workers.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prestigious British wine fraternity that
honors top-ranking wine connoisseurs is extending its cachet to
Americans and other foreigners _ if they can pass a grueling
four-day exam.
   The Institute of Masters of Wine, a staid club of British wine
merchants, is actively soliciting foreign winemakers, wine
stewards, teachers and others in the fermented grape business who
aspire to use the coveted letters ``MW'' after their names.
   Nine out of 10 candidates fail the rigorous written exams and
blind tastings. But for the successful few, MW is the wine world's
equivalent of academia's Ph.D.
   The club has only 131 members and all but 14 of them are men.
   ``We felt that we were becoming a rather introverted little
club,'' said executive director David Stevens. We would rather
become an ``internationally recognized body with prestige, weight
and influence,'' he said.
   ``We took a very dramatic decision, for us, to throw open our
doors to anyone in the world who could actually come and sit and
pass this exam. ''
   The first step was to open membership to eligible journalists
and wine writers. Only one, British wine writer and broadcaster
Jancis Robinson, has passed muster.
   Then, foreigners, including Americans, were allowed to take the
exam. So far, no U.S. palate has been admitted, although eight
Americans took the annual exam in London last month. Stevens
wouldn't give their names, but said they included wine teachers,
wine wholesalers and retailers, and sommeliers.
   They will learn on July 17 whether they have joined the tiny
group of foreigners in this unique professional body founded in
1953: Olivier Humbrecht from the Alsace region of France,
Australian wine consultant Michael Hill-Smith and winemaker Michael
Brajkovich from the Kumeu River winery in New Zealand.
   ``I think the examination is now much tougher than it used to
be, for the very simple reason that the wine industry has become
far more complicated,'' Stevens said.
   He passed on his first try in 1961, when ``basically, if we knew
about the wines of France, Germany, a little bit about sherry,
port, that was about it. Now you have to know about the wines of
the world.''
   This year's blind taste included wines from California,
Australia, New Zealand, Spain and Lebanon, plus the produce of the
more traditional wine regions of France, Germany and Italy.
   Candidates had to identify the grapes from which the wine was
made, where they were grown, and the wine's vintage. Then they had
to comment on how the wine was made and aged. Whenever possible,
the judges sneak in a bad wine to test their ability to detect
imperfections.
   Stevens said he feels education standards have declined, and
that many potential masters of wine are unaccustomed to writing
short essays required to test their knowledge of growing and
harvesting grapes and the chemistry of winemaking.
   ``I think that Americans are not used to an examination where
they have to express themselves in the written word,'' he said.
``They are much more used to answering multiple-choice-type
questions, a tick in the box. To have to produce a very long,
reasoned written answer in written form they do find difficult.''
   The essay questions test knowledge of all aspects of the wine
industry, from planting and harvesting to winemaking chemistry,
storing and maturing bulk wine, changing consumer tastes and the
trend toward mergers and takeovers in the industry.
   The open-ended questions range from ``Are bubbles worth a
premium?'' to ``The Chardonnay grape has been described as the
perfect artist's palette. Discuss and compare methods used in
different wine regions to produce the various styles'' and ``How
much should a wine reflect the personality and aims of the producer
as opposed to the character of the vineyard?''

   Congressional Democrats return to the budget
bargaining table today unhappy with a $50 billion deficit-reduction
plan that the Bush administration hopes will energize the stalled
talks.
   White House budget director Richard Darman made the proposal on
Wednesday, the first to be advanced at the six-week-old budget
summit.
   ``The administration clearly presented this so we could start
negotiations,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, ranking
Republican on the Senate Budget Committee.
   Domenici said the plan will save $440 billion over the next five
years. He called it a ``good starting point'' in efforts to shrink
a budget gap that administration and congressional experts believe
is swelling beyond earlier expectations.
   But Democrats were not enthusiastic.
   ``We have a good long way to go,'' said their lead bargainer,
House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.
   Democratic negotiators met privately following Wednesday's
negotiating session and called Darman's proposal inadequate, said a
participant in the talks who asked not to be identified.
   The plan was seen by some Democrats as differing little from the
$37 billion in savings that President Bush proposed in January in
his fiscal 1991 budget.
   Bush's spending plan has been declared obsolete by Democrats and
Republicans on Capitol Hill. Fiscal 1991 begins Oct. 1, just more
than three months from now.
   ``I'd compare (Darman's plan) that to building a new room onto a
house that's already collapsed,'' said Senate Budget Committee
Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn.
   According to officials involved in the talks, the administration
proposal relies on $20 billion in new taxes and other revenues, $18
billion in reductions in benefit programs such as Medicare, and $6
billion in defense cuts.
   It also includes $4 billion in domestic program reductions and
$2 billion saved by making lower than expected interest payments on
the national debt.
   The administration provided few details on where the savings
would come, participants said.
   Democrats say they believe at least $55 billion in savings are
needed next year, and $500 billion to $600 billion over the next
five years.
   The red ink grew again on Wednesday.
   Darman told negotiators he now believes next year's budget
shortfall will be $159 billion unless action is taken. If no action
is taken, $86 billion in cuts in most government programs would
occur Oct. 1 under the Gramm-Rudman law. That amount is considered
intolerable by most lawmakers and White House officials.
   Gramm-Rudman requires the president and Congress to reduce next
year's budget gap to $64 billion. If they miss that target by more
than $10 billion, the law imposes cuts in federal spending.
   Last month, Darman projected next year's deficit at $138 billion.
   The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the 1991
shortfall at $164 billion on Wednesday.
   All figures excluded the government cost of covering the
collapse of the savings and loan industry. Those expenses could
drive next year's deficit to about $230 billion, CBO and the White
House agree.

<HEAD>House Committee Approves Measure to Repeal Insurance Antitrust
Exemption</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Consumer groups hope election-year politics
will help them overcome insurance companies' lobbying power and win
congressional repeal of the industry's exemption from antitrust
laws.
   The House Judiciary Committee bolstered their effort Wednesday,
approving 19-17 a bill to subject insurance companies to federal
antitrust lawsuits for the first time since 1945.
   Three of the committee's 22 Democrats _ Reps. Dan Glickman of
Kansas, Bruce Morrison of Connecticut and Edward Feighan of Ohio _
voted with all 14 Republicans in opposing it.
   The bill would remove the industry's exemption from federal
antitrust laws under the 1945 McCarren-Ferguson Act, which turned
the regulation of insurance companies over to state governments.
   Policyholders who could show that states are not actively
regulating the industry could sue insurance companies and their
agents for price-fixing and other anticompetitive practices.
   ``Private individuals, local governments and businesses of all
sizes have found their premiums skyrocketing and their coverage
severely restricted,'' said Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, the
committee chairman. ``Congress can no longer ignore the widespread
economic dislocation caused by unreasonably high premiums or
policies that are unavailable at any price.''
   In addition to price-fixing, damages could be sought for the
following anticompetitive practices:
   _Allocating territories among competing companies.
   _Monopolization.
   _Forcing consumers to purchase insurance they don't want so they
can buy the kind they do want. An example is requiring the purchase
of a homeowners' policy in order to get auto insurance.
   Consumer groups seeking the legislation for the past 15 years
acknowledged they face an uphill fight. But they voiced optimism
that the committee vote opens the way for a House floor fight that
will draw public attention to the issue.
   ``This represents an important breakthrough,'' said Robert
Brandon, vice president of Citizen Action, a grassroots consumer
organization claiming 2 million members. ``It demonstrates that an
informed and aroused public can break the insurance industry's
stranglehold over legislators.''
   Linda Lipsen, legislative counsel for Consumers Union, predicted
the bill will become a major election-year issue once it reaches
the House floor.
   ``Behind food and shelter, insurance is the single largest
expenditure of the year for the average consumer,'' she said.
``Just like the gun lobby, the insurance lobby is no longer being
perceived by Congress as invincible.''
   The bill would allow insurance companies to continue sharing raw
data on claims. But after a five-year transition period, it would
greatly weaken companies' reliance upon the Insurance Services
Office, a New York-based industry organization that now ``advises''
what rates should be charged.
   A similar bill was approved by the panel's economic and
commercial law subcommittee two years ago but died there under an
intensive industry lobbying effort. Democrats said they hope to
bring the new version to the full House in late summer or early
fall.
   Although similar legislation has been introduced in the Senate,
industry lobbyists say they are counting on Sens. Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz., and Howell Heflin, D-Ala., both members of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, to prevent it from reaching a floor vote there.
   ``If this bill is enacted into law, it may prove disastrous for
consumers and small insurance companies alike,'' said Lowell Beck,
president of the National Association of Independent Insurers.
``Every litigated claim would subject to additional antitrust
counts. Legal costs, which by necessity would be passed on to
consumers, would soar.''
   Lipsen disputed that claim, citing a report by the General
Accounting Office showing that workers' compensation insurance
rates fell by 30 percent in Michigan after its legislature in 1982
repealed a state antitrust exemption for such coverage.

<HEAD>Legislation Calls for Tougher Penalties in Crime Against Women</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former New York model whose face was slashed
by razor blades says ``the stigma of victimization'' haunts her
more than the actual memory of the attack four years ago.
   ``In the scope of things, those cuts to my face that night
became almost insignificant except as a reference point,'' Marla
Hanson told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.
   The comment came at a hearing on legislation sponsored by
committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., calling for tougher
penalties for violence against women. It would make gender-related
crimes a violation of civil rights, entitling victims to sue for
damages.
   The bill also would:
   _Double the minimum penalties for rape on federal property from
six to 12 years and from nine to 18 years for rape that involves
injury, weapons or kidnapping. A convicted rapist would have to pay
his victim for medical, psychological or rehabilitation costs and
lost income.
   _Provide $300 million in grants to combat gender-related crimes.
   _Create a national commission on violence against women.
   The number of rapes has increased four times faster than total
crime over the last decade, according to committee figures. A woman
is beaten every 18 seconds and raped every six minutes, the
committee said.
   The committee also heard from Nancy Ziegenmeyer, a Grinnell,
Iowa, woman who was abducted and raped in 1988. She said police
treated her well but that prosecutors were overworked and she was
hurt emotionally by an impersonal criminal justice system.
   ``The crime against my body and my person became a crime against
the state,'' she said. ``I became just a witness for the state of
Iowa and a case number. It was a crime against the state. It no
longer was a crime against me.''
   Ms. Hanson and Mrs. Ziegenmeyer, who testified in an effort to
draw attention to the problem, said they saw little that Congress
could do to cut down on such crimes but that women could be better
treated by the system.
   They called for advocates to ensure that victims understand the
court process.
   Female victims often suffer harsh treatment in the court system,
said Linda Fairstein, chief of the sex crimes prosecution unit in
the Manhattan district attorney's office.
   ``I agree wholeheartedly with Nancy and Marla there is a true
need within the system for advocates working with both the
prosecutors and the victims,'' she said.
   Ms. Hanson, a 29-year-old student at New York University,
underwent extensive plastic surgery to diminish the scars she
suffered. The attack occurred after Ms. Hanson rebuffed advances
from her landlord.
   ``It seems in this society the term innocence implies some sort
of guilt _ and nowhere is that attitude more apparent than in our
current judicial system,'' she said, telling the committee that
defense lawyers tried to make it seem that she was a ``woman of
loose morals.''
   Ms. Hanson's landlord and two other assailants each were given
the maximum five- to 15-year sentence. Mrs. Ziegenmeyer's attacker
was sentenced to life in prison with no possibility of parole on
first-degree kidnapping charges.

<HEAD>Says PLO Acquiescence Still Necessary for Peace Talks</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Bush Rdp Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Despite the suspension of U.S. talks
with the Palestine Liberation Organization, Secretary of State
James A. Baker III says Israel still needs the acquiescence of the
PLO to find a partner for peace talks.
   Baker, whose recommendation for a suspension of the 18-month
dialogue was approved and announced by President Bush on a
political trip to Alabama, defended the decision even while
admitting it would hurt moderate Arabs.
   ``We really could not let our pursuit of peace stand in the way
of our commitment to fight terrorism,'' Baker said late Wednesday
en route to East Berlin for talks on German unification.
   ``A resort to terrorism would undermine any peace process that
was unfolding,'' Baker said before a refueling stop here.
   And yet, he said the 18-month dialogue that Bush suspended over
an aborted attack on Tel Aviv three weeks ago contributed the to
U.S. effort to get Israelis to talk to Palestinian Arabs.
   And, Baker said, the suspension ordered by Bush because PLO
Chairman Yasser Arafat did not disavow the attack or punish the
perpetrators ``could have an adverse impact'' on Egypt and other
moderates, including some Palestinians.
   Baker stressed they will keep trying to persuade Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's government to approve U.S. terms for
talks with Palestinians.
   ``We were not seeking a dialogue between Israel and the PLO,''
Baker said.
   But, he said, ``everybody recognizes that without PLO
acquiescence there won't be a dialogue for Israel. They have been
seeking to develop one for 22 years (since the 1967 Mideast war)
and none has come forward. That points up the way in which this
dialogue could contribute toward progress toward a peace process.''
   The last Israeli government, also headed by Shamir, refused to
accept Baker's formula for talks in March and then collapsed. The
new government formed by Shamir has laid down even stiffer terms
for talking to Palestinians.
   But senior U.S. officials on Baker's plane said the formula
would not be changed. ``We're not prepared to embrace ideas that
are non-starters,'' said one official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The U.S. break with the PLO, long sought by Israel, could put
pressure on Shamir to go along with Baker's formula, which includes
participation in the talks of Palestinians deported from the West
Bank.
   ``We've not got a formal answer to our question,'' a U.S.
official said. ``Now if we get a no, what is the reason for it?
OK?''

<TEXT>
   A convicted
murderer and another prisoner who broke out of a maximum-security
prison in a daring helicopter escape were recaptured Wednesday
night, authorities said.
   Robert Ford, 32, and convicted robber David Thomas, 24, were
plucked out of the exercise yard in Kent prison, about 50 miles
east of Vancouver, in Monday's escape. A prison guard was shot in
the leg during the escape.
   The two were arrested without incident on Echo Island, a small,
heavily forested island in the middle of Harrison Lake, said Sgt.
Sid Slater of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
   Echo Island, visible from this tourist town east of Vancouver,
is about nine miles north of the prison.
   About 10-15 police with dogs stayed on the island after the
capture and patrol boats were deployed in case a third man, the
accomplice who helped the pair escape, was also on the island,
Slater said.
   Prison spokeswoman Diane Brown said Ford was serving a life
sentence for first-degree murder and that Thomas was serving an
eight-year term for robbery.
   The Bell 206 helicopter used in the Monday escape attempt and
its pilot, Fred Fandrich, were hijacked from Valley Helicopters
Ltd. Frandrich was released soon after the hijacking.
   It was Ford's second failed escape attempt. In March 1989, Ford
and two other men escaped from a prison in Victoria, British
Columbia, while awaiting trial. They were captured 11 days later.
   Al Hadvick, a representative for the Public Service Alliance of
Canada, said about 20 guards at Kent prison staged a strike
Wednesday to protest the handling of the escape.
   Ken Peterson, an official at Kent, said 40 reports had been
filed by prison staff on Ford. He said the Charter of Rights and
lack of evidence prevented prison officials from segregating Ford.
   Peterson said prison officials had received staff reports that
Ford might have been planning a prison break prior to his escape
and added that officials were aware that Ford had a helicopter
pilot's licence.
   Hadvick said corrections officials had submitted reports that
Ford had been exploring possible escape routes and was once timed
by another prisoner as he sprinted from one area of the prison to
another.

<HEAD>Government Agrees to Release up to $6 Million in Noriega Assets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors have offered to release up to $6
million from Manuel Noriega's frozen accounts to let him pay for
his defense. Panama's new government immediately warned it will lay
claim to the former dictator's assets.
   The deal Wednesday with Noriega's lawyers could end weeks of
wrangling over $20 million frozen in accounts around the world
after the U.S. invasion of Panama _ money the defense in the drug
trafficking case said it needs to proceed.
   The move also would avoid a showdown over potentially
embarassing details of payments by the CIA and other U.S
intelligence agencies to the former Panamanian leader.
   ``This avoids distracting litigation and premature presentation
of evidence that would only sidetrack us from the real issues,''
said U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen.
   Noriega's chief attorney, Frank Rubino, who had threatened make
the CIA payments public after the collapse of a previous compromise
under which the government was to pay Noriega's lawyers, said he
was happy with the new deal.
   ``I think the American people should be thrilled that their
taxes are not funding Noriega's defense,'' Rubino said. He denied
the government was trying to avoid embarassment, saying prosecutors
simply wanted ``a good trial, a fair trial.''
   However, one potential roadblock for the deal was a $5.3 billion
racketeering suit against Noriega announced at the hearing
Wednesday on behalf of Panama.
   Panama's attorney Gregory Craig said the lawsuit will allege
murder, grand theft and extortion by Noriega. He said it is being
filed so that ``no irreparable damage be done to those funds that
rightfully belong to the Panamanian people.''
   But U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler warned Craig he will
not let the lawsuit interfere with the criminal trial, set to begin
in January 1991.
   Under the arrangement to free some of Noriega's assets, the
government will ask European nations that froze some of 27 Noriega
accounts at the request of the United States to release them to
Hoeveler. Some of the accounts were seized by other judicial
districts in the United States, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael
Sullivan said judges there and in Europe will have to approve the
deal.
   Rubino said the money is deposited in about half a dozen
European countries.
   Under the agreement, the total to be released will be between
$4.5 million and $6 million.
   Defense attorney Steven Kollin estimated the defense will cost
$5 million and said the government is prepared to spend close to
$40 million to convict Noriega.
   Wednesday's deal was foreshadowed last week when the judge
criticized the freezing of Noriega's accounts. The judge said the
government must either prove that the money was drug profits, as it
claimed, or release it to the defense.
   Noriega's lawyers had threatened to quit unless they got paid.
   Noriega, who surrendered to U.S. troops Jan. 4, is being held in
the Metropolitan Correctional Center outside of Miami on charges of
taking $4.6 million in bribes to protect the Colombian cocaine
trade.
   In addition to the racketeering lawsuit, two news photographers
injured by U.S. gunfire during the invasion of Panama sued Manuel
Noriega for $3 million on Wednesday, saying he is to blame for
``letting loose the dogs of war.''
   Sygma photographer Patrick Chauvel of France was shot in the
abdomen and Reuters photographer Malcolm Linton of Britain was shot
in the leg on Dec. 15 outside a Panama City hotel.
   In the lawsuit, they claim Noriega is responsible for their
injuries because he provoked the invasion.

<HEAD>New Combination of Drugs Approved for Advanced Colon Cancer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration has approved
a new combination drug treatment that has been shown to prolong
survival for patients with advanced stages of colon cancer.
   The therapy combines levamisole, a drug previously approved only
for eliminating intestinal parasites in animals, with fluorouracil,
already approved for treatment of several types of cancer.
   FDA officials said Wednesday the combination of the two drugs in
patients who have undergone surgery for colon cancer that has
spread to nearby lymph nodes has been shown to reduce tumor
reccurence and death in some patients.
   Colon cancer that has spread to lymph nodes is classified as
stage 3, a category that applies to about 21,000 of the 110,000
Americans diagnosed with colon cancer each year. About 40 percent
live for five years or more after surgery, the FDA said.
   The combination therapy was tested in two clinical trials
sponsored by the National Cancer Institute that involved about
1,700 patients who had undergone surgery for stage 3 colon cancer.
   Researchers found that the treatment reduced the death rate for
these patients by about one-third and the tumor-recurrence rate by
about 40 percent.
   They don't know, however, how the five-year survival rate will
be affected since they have not followed these test patients that
long yet, said FDA spokeswoman Eva Kemper.

<HEAD>Automakers, Insurers Clash On Copyrighting Auto Part Design</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Automakers and insurers disagree over
copyright protection for product designs.
   The auto industry urged Congress on Wednesday to approve
legislation that would prohibit independent manufacturers from
copying a part's original design for a decade after it first
appears on the market.
   The bills would protect consumers from shoddy imitation parts,
auto lobbyists told the House Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual
Property and Administration of Justice.
   ``Imitation sheet metal parts are often of lesser quality in
fit, finish and durability,'' said Kenneth W. Myers of Ford Motor
Co.
   He spoke on behalf of the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers
Association, which represents the Big Three U.S. automakers.
   Opponents, led by insurers, said the legislation was designed to
squelch competition in the lucrative replacement parts industry,
which generated $52 billion in sales in 1988. The price of parts
will soar if the bills are passed, they said.
   ``American consumers will have to pay hundreds of millions of
dollars a year in monopoly profits to ... auto manufacturers and
they will get nothing in return,'' said C.A. Ingham, vice president
of State Farm Insurance Co.

   A major earthquake devastated cities and

130 people were killed and 1,650 injured as buildings crumbled onto
them.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) said the quake
caused ``massive destruction,'' triggering landslides that blocked
main roads and hampered rescue efforts.
   Rescue workers struggled to pull victims from the rubble. IRNA
said the death toll was expected to climb as hundreds of people
were missing.
   The Geophysics Center at Tehran University said the quake
measured 7.3 on the Richter Scale. The U.S. Geological Survey
measured it at 7.7 on the scale.
   IRNA said the quake struck at 12:30 a.m. while most people were
either sleeping or watching World Cup soccer on television. It
quoted the Geophysics Center as saying aftershocks continued for
about two hours.
   Tehran Radio said 50 people were killed and more than 700
injured in the city of Zanjan, 190 miles northwest of Tehran.
   It said 500 people were killed or injured in and around the
village of Hir in the same region. It said several area villages
were ``destroyed.''
   IRNA said an unspecified number of people also were killed and
injured in the Caspian Sea port city of Rasht 175 miles northwest
of Tehran.
   ``The exact number of casualties and the extent of losses were
still unknown,'' it reported.
   IRNA reported roads blocked by landslides and said a request had
been sent to the Interior Ministry for medical teams and heavy
lifting machinery.
   The agency said rescuers and relief teams had set up
headquarters in Rasht.
   IRNA said the quake also shook Tehran, sending panicked people
into the streets. There were no reported casualties in Tehran.
   The earthquake struck in the Caspian about 15 miles off the
Iranian coast, said Russ Needham, a geophysicist with the U.S.
Geological Survey National Earth Information Center in Golden, Colo.
   The Geophysics Center at Tehran University said the quake was
centered 125 miles northwest of Tehran.
   Needham said that preliminary data put the epicenter 210 miles
northwest of Tehran and 160 miles south of Baku, an oil port and
capital of the Soviet republic of Azerbaijan. He said there was ``a
good possibility of casualties and damage'' in southern Azerbaijan.
   The opposition Mujahedeen Khalq claimed the government was
under-reporting the casualties and damage.
   ``Thousands of people were killed or wounded,'' Ali Safavi, a
spokesman for the group, said by telephone from the group's base in
Baghdad, Iraq.
   His reports, quoting the group's sources inside Iran, could not
be independently confirmed.
   The earthquake that struck San Francisco in October measured 7.1
on the Richter scale. It left 67 people dead and caused damage
estimated at $7 billion.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.
   An earthquake with a magnitude of 7 is capable of widespread,
heavy damage while an earthquake measuring 8 is capable of
tremendous damage.

   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange erased
its early gains and closed marginally lower Thursday, while the
dollar edged up against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar closed at 154.60 yen, up 0.62 yen from Wednesday's
153.98-yen finish. It opened at 154.28 yen and ranged between
154.25 yen and 154.63 yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average fell 0.49 of a point, or
0.0015 percent, ending the day at 32,087.27. The index ended the
early session with a 38.89-point gain before falling back in the
afternoon.
   ``Although the index rose earlier when investment trust
companies were buying, it gradually fell as trading lost
direction,'' said Tomoyuki Morimoto, a trader with New Japan
Securities Co.
   The weaker yen and a decline in government bond prices also
discouraged participants, he said.
   The benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese government bond fell to
87.28 points from Wednesday's close of 87.42, boosting the yield to
7.125 percent from 7.095 percent.
   In currency dealing, the dollar continued to rise after showing
strength in overseas markets overnight, dealers said.
   They said some participants bought the dollar because of
political uncertainties in the Soviet Union, while others sold the
currency for technical adjustments.
   Hard-line Communists have made it clear they will try to replace
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev as leader of the Soviet Communist
Party at a party congress set for early July.

   The world's biggest convention on AIDS
began under siege by thousands of angry demonstrators frustrated
that many of them are likely to die of the disease before
scientists learn to control it.
   Police said 80 demonstrators were arrested Wednesday, and
speakers at the opening ceremonies in the evening repeatedly
alluded to the protesters.
   While conference participants were entertained by the San
Francisco Gay Mens' Chorus in the heavily guarded Moscone Center, a
crowd outside chanted: ``We're here. We're queer. And we demand
access.''
   About half the estimated 50,000 gay men in San Francisco are
infected with the AIDS virus, epidemiologists say.
   ``The anger and frustration that surrounds this conference and
pushes into it comes from seeing loved ones die,'' Mayor Art Agnos
told the conference. ``I know, because I have gone through the same
experiences, and I am doing so now with people I love.''
   The Sixth International Conference on AIDS drew an estimated
12,000 researchers, doctors, social workers and other AIDS
professionals, along with 1,800 reporters and thousands of
activists.
   More than 100 groups, including the International Planned
Parenthood Foundation, boycotted the meeting in opposition to an
immigration policy that allows foreigners infected with the AIDS
virus to be barred from the United States.
   ``The conference organizers also oppose the U.S. immigration
policy in the strongest possible terms,'' the conference chairman,
Dr. John L. Ziegler, told the gathering.
   While AIDS specialists generally sympathized with demonstrators'
frustration, many resented disruptions like one that occurred at an
AIDS pharmaceutical meeting earlier Wednesday.
   About a dozen members of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power ran
through, shouting and tossing leaflets. After a few minutes of
arguing over an ACT UP member's attempt to seize the floor, the
invited speakers left and talked by closed-circuit TV from another
room.
   Many doctors were upset.
   ``They think that practicing physicians are the enemy. This will
hinder the exchange of useful information,'' said Dr. John Weiser
of Minneapolis.
   Dr. June E. Osborn, chairman of the National Commission on AIDS,
cautioned that anger ``can be a powerful source of raw energy, but
it must be transformed into resolve in order to be useful.''
   In an effort to avert trouble, Peter Staley, an ACT UP member
from New York, was invited to give one of the opening speeches.
   He attempted to lead the delegates in an anti-Bush
administration chant using a conservative estimate of the worldwide
AIDS toll: ``300,000 dead from AIDS. Where is George?'' Few
participated.
   ``On my side, the level of anger and frustration is reaching
such a point that attitudes claiming that all of you are uncaring
and in it for greed are now widespread,'' Staley said.
   The magnitude of the challenge was clear in a report by the
National Academy of Sciences about the likely course of the
epidemic. It said that while new infections appear to be leveling
off in gay men, the virus is spreading rapidly among crack smokers,
heavy drinkers, women and teen-agers.
   ``We believe the picture of AIDS and HIV infection in the
foreseeable future is one of a continuing toll of sickness and
death for a steadily broadening profile of individuals,'' said one
of the authors, Dr. Don C. Des Jarlais of Mount Sinai School of
Medicine in New York.
   There were also reminders of science's rapidly building
understanding of AIDS and the human immunodeficiency virus.
   At a symposium, Dr. Luc Montagnier of the Pasteur Institute in
Paris, suggested tiny bacteria called mycoplasma might work with
HIV, the AIDS virus, to kill cells.
   ``There are shortcomings in the idea that HIV causes all the
signs of AIDS,'' said Montagnier, a discoverer of the virus.
Preliminary studies in his laboratory suggest treatment of AIDS
patients with antiviral drugs in combination with drugs that attack
mysoplasma might alleviate some of the worst symptoms of the
disease.
   Dr. Jay A. Levy of the University of California at San Francisco
noted the recent discovery that white cells called suppressor cells
make a protein that holds virus-infected cells in check.
Identifying this substance should provide a new antiviral drug.
   Experiments in chimpanzees also show that a vaccine against HIV
may be possible.
   ``In this decade, we have come a long way in our understanding
of HIV infection, and our direction now seems much better
defined,'' Levy said. ``Where we are on the path to conquering
AIDS, however, is still uncertain. But we have begun to see the
horizon, and we will get there.''

<HEAD>Opera Thrilled to Host Last Performance</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Australian Orchestra says it's
honored to host the final performances of Dame Joan Sutherland, but
watching the last show will be a costly proposition.
   Ms. Sutherland, 63, announced in London on Wednesday that the
Australian Opera's performance of ``Les Huguenots'' in September
will be the swan song of her 40-year career.
   All eight performances already are sold out. Tickets for the
final show on Oct. 2 were snapped up at the beginning of the year
and a premium seat cost $390 (U.S.).
   She was to have brought down the curtain for the last time at
London's Covent Garden in December and January with Strauss' opera
``Die Fledermaus,'' but changed her mind due to the heavy demands
of singing the part of the vivacious Rosalinde.
   Her husband, conductor Richard Bonynge, said Wednesday during a
break in the Sydney rehearsals for ``The Gipsy Princess'' that
``Die Fledermaus'' was ``too hard on the legs _ a killer for her.''
   ``It's a long, demanding role, involving dancing and costume
changes,'' he said. ``She is on stage for the entire first act,
most of the second and all of the third.
   ``By contrast, `Les Huguenots' is one of her old party pieces.
She's on for one act and a bit in a five-act opera. Joan wanted to
go out on top and not tarnish the public's memories of her earlier
performances in `Fledermaus.' ''

   Time has not stopped the tears or shaken
Judy Bradley's belief that a murderer ended her mother's life five
years ago.
   Now, new witnesses and an exhumation and autopsy have
authorities re-evaluating what they thought was the natural death
of Thelma Lillian Blodgett.
   Life itself had shown no signs of slowing the tiny, graying
spitfire known around the neighborhood as Aunt Tillie. If she
feared the ex-convicts and rowdies around her apartment in South
Salt Lake, she didn't let on.
   The 4-foot-11 woman often was in the thick of things, upbraiding
drug users, refereeing a brawl or lending money to a neighbor
pleading hard luck.
   ``Actually, it scared a lot of us, but my mother was feisty,''
Bradley said. ``Guys would fight in the parking lot and she'd go
out there and grab them by the ear and tell them to knock it off.
   ``My mother could get scared, but she wouldn't let anyone else
know it. She was feisty right up until the day she died.''
   She died on July 11, 1985. Bradley was convinced her mother did
not go peacefully. ``Things were just not right,'' she said.
   A South Salt Lake police report indicates Blodgett died in her
bathroom in the afternoon. Finding no marks on the body or
suspicious circumstances, officers told Bradley her 69-year-old
mother apparently had a heart attack.
   ``I said, `I'm telling you right now somebody killed her.' I
argued with all of them, and believe me that house was full of
police officers,'' Bradley said.
   One of them, Detective Sgt. Jim Foster, said police followed up
when Bradley phoned later that night to report some of her mother's
belongings missing. But a medical examiner concluded Blodgett died
of natural causes.
   New evidence suggests Bradley was right, investigators say.
   On June 11, Blodgett's body was exhumed and an autopsy performed
by a new medical examiner, Dr. Todd Grey. He changed the cause of
death to ``undetermined'' and promised a further report in about a
week from today.
   Investigators said the exhumation order was obtained after they
talked with witnesses who had not previously come forward.
   ``Homicide cases are like that. You'll hit a brick wall, then
somebody decides to talk about it,'' said Jim Bell, chief
investigator for the medical examiner.
   Investigators said their new information involves Daniel Troyer,
a Utah State Prison inmate awaiting trial on charges of murdering
88-year-old Ethel Luckau of Salt Lake City in 1988.
   Troyer, who has a prior conviction for the rape and beating of a
66-year-old woman, was questioned in 1988 about the deaths of four
elderly woman, including Blodgett and Luckau. But police came up
with few leads in all but the Luckau case.
   Defense attorney James Valdez insists his client had nothing to
do with Blodgett's death or the deaths of any of the other women
police have questioned him about.
   ``The problem is, any time an elderly woman dies of suspicious
circumstances, they're all the time automatically considering Danny
as a suspect,'' he said.
   The attorney did not know of any new evidence investigators may
have against his client, and police will not say.
   The renewed interest came as a surprise to Bradley.
   Tears still flow freely when she thinks of her mother, as she
has every day since that morning she met her for coffee, left for a
half hour and returned to find her body.
   ``You relive it every day. I know I want them to find her
killer. It'll give me some relief, but it won't make it easier,''
she said.
   Her days are spent at home, taking care of an old friend
immobilized by a stroke. The two get by on Bradley's widow's
pension and his Social Security and veteran's benefits. The ordeal
has drained her of energy and ambition at age 49.
   But it hasn't quite snuffed the spark of the renegade, who like
Tillie grew up fast, ran wild as a teen-ager and married ``too
many'' times.
   ``They better find that guy because sooner or later I will if it
takes the rest of my life,'' she said.

<HEAD>Taiwanese Defector Singer Deported From China: Report</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A popular folk singer deported back to his
native Taiwan for criticizing Beijing's crackdown on dissent says
Chinese officials gave him a choice: prison or the return to Taiwan.
   ``I chose to leave,'' Hou Dejian, 34, was quoted as saying by
the United Daily News. Taiwan officials said Hou had returned to
Taiwan on Wednesday by fishing boat and that he was being
questioned by authorities.
   Hou defected from Taiwan in 1983, saying he needed to seek his
roots. Liu Peng-chun, deputy director of the Exit and Entry Bureau,
said the singer would be allowed to resettle in Taiwan because he
was fleeing political suppression.
   Hou and two other dissidents disappeared in Beijing on May 31
just hours before they were to issue an open letter to Chinese
leaders calling for the release of political prisoners.
   The other two _ university newspaper editor Gao Xin and former
university lecturer Zhou Duo _ resurfaced earlier this week in
Beijing, with Gao saying he spent the two weeks ``vacationing''
under police supervision.
   In an interview with the United Daily News, Hou said he was
deported by Chinese authorities after being detained 10 days in
Beijing for his public criticism of the bloody crackdown of the
pro-democracy movement last year that left hundreds of civilians
dead.
   ``I had tried to persuade them (Chinese officials) into
accepting good reasoning and accepting dissidents who held
different opinions,'' Hou said. ``My efforts were a complete
failure.''
   He said he was placed on a patrol boat in the southern Chinese
port of Fuzhou on Monday and transferred to a Taiwanese fishing
vessel that brought him back to the offshore island.
   Hou's father was soldier and one of the 2 million followers of
the Nationalist government who retreated to Taiwan in 1949 after
losing a civil war to communist forces on the Chinese mainland.
   Hou was a commercially established singer before, during a 1983
visit to the Communist mainland, he decided to stay.
   The darling of the government, he was allowed to keep living
like a star, with two homes and two cars, one a maroon Mercedes
Benz.
   The skinny, chain-smoking Hou is famous among Chinese on the
mainland, Taiwan and Hong Kong for his Bob Dylan-influenced songs
about social concerns, such as the endangered pandas, and about the
worries of youth. But he became known to Westerners when, in the
final days of China's student democracy movement, he and three
friends began a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square to protest
martial law.
   Many students were already leaving the square out of fear, and
the hunger strike infused the movement with new spirit.
    When troops were called in to crush the pro-democracy movement
on June 3-4, the four negotiated safe passage out of besieged
Tiananmen Square for the few thousand remaining student protesters.
   Hou then hid in the Australian Embassy in Beijing for more than
two months until the Chinese government promised he would not be
arrested. After he left the embassy, he was one of the few Chinese
to continue to publicly call for democratic reform.

<TEXT>
   A new species of monkey with a lion's head and a
striking gold and black coat has been discovered in an unlikely
place _ a highly urbanized part of Brazil, scientists say.
   The black-faced lion tamarin, as the new monkey is called, is a
golden squirrel-sized monkey with black face, forearms and tail,
and a big, bushy mane. It was discovered this spring, researchers
said Wednesday.
   ``It's quite remarkable, because it's almost like finding
something in the suburbs of Los Angeles,'' said Russell
Mittermeier, president of Conservation International in Washington.
   It is only the fourth species of lion tamarin known. It will be
the highlight of a meeting on lion tamarins to be held in Brazil
beginning today.
   The discovery of the monkey ``complicates conservationists' jobs
because we have to be concerned with another species in another
habitat,'' said Charles Snowdon, a zoologist and psychologist at
the University of Wisconsin.
   On the other hand, he said, ``It may be important for getting
better ideas about how to conserve all species of lion tamarins.''
   The new lion tamarin was found by two biology students who had
just taken their first jobs as professors, Lucia Lorini and Vanessa
Guerra Persson. They were collaborating with Dante Martins Teixera
of the National Museum in Rio de Janeiro.
   The discovery ``is biologically important and an important
conservation challenge as well,'' said Benjamin Beck, associate
director of the National Zoo in Washington. Further studies of the
animals' habitat and their relation to other lion tamarins should
be conducted soon, he said.
   When Mittermeier learned of the discovery, he immediately
committed $30,000 toward such studies and toward protection of this
highly endangered new species.
   The black-faced lion taarin was discovered on the island of
Superagui, south of the city of Sao Paulo, in the Brazilian state
of Parana. Parana is one of Brazil's most developed areas, with
only 3 percent of its original forest cover remaining, Mittermeier
said.
   Part of the island is a national park, Mittermeier said, but the
black-faced lion tamarin was found only in another part of the
island, he said.
   Preliminary surveys suggest that only a few dozen of the
black-faced lion tamarins have survived, Mittermeier said.
   Three other species of lion tamarins are known, the most famous
of them the golden-lion tamarin, which has been bred in captivity
at the National Zoo and elsewhere around the world. It has been
reintroduced into a reserve in Brazil.
   All are members of the genus Leontopithecus. The new lion
tamarin was named Leontopithecus caissara after the coastal
fishermen, or caicaras, who live and work on the island where it
was found.
   All of the lion tamarins are endangered, primarily because the
coastal Atlantic forest of Brazil, their sole habitat, has nearly
disappeared under the crush of a burgeoning human population.
   Researchers must find out exactly how many black-faced lion
tamarins remain, exactly where and how they live, what they eat and
what other animals live in the same places, Beck said.

<HEAD>Temple Dig May Reveal Much About Ancient Culture</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A 4,000-year-old temple believed to honor a
goddess of healing is being unearthed in Iraq and may shed light on
ancient medicine and other aspects of life in Babylonian times,
archeologists say.
   Digging began in January on the relatively untouched structure
in Nippur. Nippur was the religious heart of Mesopotamia and the
site of many temples, but archeologists said they were surprised by
the size of this temple.
   Diggers have only uncovered about a sixth of the temple's
foundation, estimated to be 100 yards long and 40 yards wide, and
already they have discovered baked clay figurines in the shapes of
humans and dogs.
   The temple, believed to honor the goddess Gula, may shed light
on Babylonian politics, economics, medicine and social structure,
said McGuire Gibson, archaeology professor at the University of
Chicago's Oriental Institute.
   ``We really still don't understand a lot about Mesopotamian
culture,'' he said Wednesday.
   Mesopotamia, the area between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in
what is now Iraq and Syria, was the site of several ancient
civilizations beginning some 8,000 years ago.
   Much of what is known about those times comes from clay tablets,
the equivalent of modern-day letters. Remnants of other temples in
Nippur and elsewhere have been examined piecemeal and have often
been disturbed by diggers who have removed important artifacts,
archaeologists say.
   Findings from the dig could supplement information from clay
tablets and show ``not what people say they did, but what they
actually did,'' said Harvey Weiss, an archaeology professor at Yale
University who was not involved in the dig.
   Gibson and his colleagues hope to find new insights into
Babylonian medicine. ``One figurine shows a man clutching his
throat; another shows a man holding his stomach,'' he said.
``They're obviously showing Gula where it hurts.''
   The dog figurines may have been left to honor the goddess, since
dogs were associated with Gula, Gibson said.
   There was a highly developed system of health care during the
period in which the temple existed. Doctors prescribed herbs. When
the herbs didn't work, magicians performed exorcisms or other
spiritual intercession, but that information is based largely on
information from clay tablets, said William Biggs, a University of
Chicago professor who studies such tablets.
   The best possible discovery would be an archive of medical
texts, which might have been stored in the temple, Biggs said.
``That would be tremendously important because most of the medical
texts we have are from 800 years later,'' he said.
   Gibson said he first found a corner of the temple in 1973, but
shifting sands prevented excavation.
   Digging is at a lull during the hot summer months, but Gibson
said he will return to the site in January. Archaeologists from the
Oriental Institute have been digging in Nippur for 40 years under
an agreement with Iraq, Gibson said.

   The Japanese yen weakened against almost all major
currencies in Tokyo today, as stocks erased early gains and ended
the day almost unchanged.
   The dollar closed at 154.60 yen, up 0.62 yen from Wednesday's
153.98-yen finish. It opened at 154.28 yen and ranged between
154.25 yen and 154.63 yen.
   ``Only the yen was weaker,'' said Toru Kanai, a foreign exchange
analyst with New Japan Securities Co.
   He said market players bought European currencies, especially
the West German mark and British pound, as well as the dollar,
against the yen for technical adjustments.
   ``There has been no specific reason to buy the yen recently, and
that is why the currency's getting weaker,'' Kanai said.
   About $10 billion changed hands in spot trading, up from
Wednesday's $6.9 billion.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average
fell 0.49 points, or 0.0015 percent, ending the day at 32,087.27.
The index, which gained more than 100 points at one point in early
trading, ended the morning session up 38.89 points before falling
back in the afternoon.
   Traders attributed the index's slide to the weaker yen and
government bond prices, which discouraged participants and made
trading directionless.
   Despite some arbitrage buying _ to take profits from price gaps
between the spot and futures markets _ toward the end of the
afternoon session, the index failed to strengthen because ``the
majority of market players stepped off to the sidelines,'' said
Kozo Hasunuma, a trader with Yamaichi Securities Co.
   Volume on the market's first section was estimated at 400
million shares, unchanged from Wednesday.
   In bond dealings, benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese government
bonds closed at 87.14 points, down from Wednesday's close of 87.42.
Their yield was 7.155 percent, up from the previous day's 7.095
percent.

80 arrests on the opening day of the Sixth International Conference
on AIDS.
   The demonstrators Wednesday were demanding greater efforts to
fight AIDS and wider access to experimental drugs.
   ``If you were going to die, if your death sentence was two to
three years, wouldn't you be fighting and saying, `Get off your
butt and help me stay alive?''' Victor Phillips of Billings, Mont.,
shouted through the screen mesh of a police bus.
   Most of those arrested were charged with interfering with police
officers, a misdemeanor, authorities said.
   The conference drew an estimated 12,000 researchers, doctors,
social workers and other AIDS professionals, along with 1,800
reporters and thousands of activists.
   AIDS activists have converged on San Francisco for the
conference and the city's annual Gay Pride march this weekend. Paul
Feldman of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, or ACT UP,
estimated the number of activists at a couple thousand.
   Feldman said most of the 40 ACT UP U.S. chapters were
represented Wednesday, along with members from 25 foreign chapters.
   A conference sponsored by the pharmaceutical company Hoffman
LaRoche was disrupted when G'dali Braverman, a member of New York
ACT UP, climbed onto the stage to decry the lack of access to the
experimental drug DDC.
   Some members of the audience yelled ``Get out! Get out!'' Others
shouted, ``Let him speak!''
   The panel, led by Dr. Jerome Groopman of Boston's New England
Deaconess Hospital, walked out. The conference resumed with the
speakers addressing the audience from another room over a video
system in the auditorium.
   The audience of doctors and researchers had mixed feelings.
   ``How are you suppose to respond?'' asked David Russell, a
Boston doctor who treats AIDS patients. ``I see their point, but
we're here to try to learn so we can help.''
   Later, several hundred demonstrators marched to barriers
surrounding the Moscone Center, carrying signs reading, ``Their
System, Their Profits, Our Lives.''
   ``We're here. We're queer. And we demand access,'' they chanted.
   After hearing speakers from New York, Los Angeles, Mexico and
Chicago, members of the crowd began rattling the barricades and
jumped over. Police in riot gear used nightsticks to rap the
fingers of those shaking the barricades.
   There were several bloody knuckles but no other injuries.

   Delivery boys and Wall Streeters. Mothers and
grandmothers. Blacks and whites. They mixed and cheered together
during Nelson Mandela's historic visit to their city.
   The South African freedom fighter who spent 27 years behind bars
in his struggle against apartheid stepped off a plane Wednesday and
into a hero's welcome.
   Ticker tape cascaded onto his bulletproof ``Mandelamobile''
during a parade up Broadway. Students at a Brooklyn high school
shouted ``Man-del-a! Man-del-a!.'' He got the key to the city.
   Mandela made people laugh and made them weep. He smiled and
waved and enchanted the politicians along with the throngs.
   ``Nelson! I named my son after you,'' shouted a tearful Uhuru
Williams of Rochester, accompanied by the 3-year-old boy at City
Hall.
   The 71-year-old Mandela smiled at her from the stage.
   ``There are few really great heroes left,'' said Martin
McDonnough, of suburban New York City. ``This is not a Nixon or a
Bush but someone who was in jail 28 years of his life and suffered
and stood up for his beliefs.''
   ``Just look around, it's white-black-white-black-white-black,''
businessman Tom Kellerhals said of the parade crowd. ``Sometimes
the answer is in front of us.''
   In Brooklyn, students at Boys and Girls High School shouted as
Mandela arrived in a motorcade after landing at Kennedy Airport.
   At the parade, the emotional peak of Mandela's first day in the
United States, Derrick Fuller shouted, ``The greatest freedom
fighter ever!'' as Mandela and his wife, Winnie, passed by in the
flatbed truck outfitted with a glass bubble.
   Riding with the Mandelas were Gov. Mario Cuomo and Mayor David
Dinkins.
   Fathers hoisted sons on their shoulders and women thrust forward
uncomprehending babies as if they were cameras.
   Leslie Anderson of Plainfield, N.J., took the day off to see the
man she called a legend. ``I was too young to see Martin Luther
King and Malcolm X. He's the last of the great black heroes,'' she
said.
   ``We don't live in apartheid. But it's here. It's real,'' she
added. ``New York is a prime example. Think of Bensonhurst,'' where
a black teen-ager was murdered by a white mob last year.
   Standing a few feet away was Fred Marks, a white businessman who
also had come out to see Mandela.
   ``I think any man who spent 27 years in jail deserves a look,''
he said.
   A father and son guitar duo sat under a tree nearby, playing the
blues.
   ``Me and my father wrote a little something about Mandela and
Dinkins meeting, about the Mandelas in New York,'' said Ted
Williams Jr. ``It's happy. It's nice. You can do the chicken dance
to it.''
   Many who skipped work to see Mandela declined to be interviewed
for the record, but one man agreed to appear on television. Asked
what he would tell his boss if he was spotted, he said: ``I'm gonna
say two words: Nelson Mandela.''
   Sean Smith, a foreign currency options broker, saw irony in the
parade's location. ``This is the biggest laughable thing that ever
happened,'' he said, ``that Wall Street supported apartheid and
turned around and threw a ticker-tape parade.''
   Not everyone was impressed with the visit. Wayne Moore squatted
as he shined the shoes of a well-dressed man at a Broadway corner.
   ``Shine 'em up!'' he yelled as he buffed. ``Shine em up!''
   ``I heard Mandela was coming down today, so there'd be a big
crowd and I'd make more money,'' Moore said. ``Do I think he could
change my situation? Kind of hard to think that.''

   A senior PLO official said today that the
U.S. suspension of its dialogue with the group struck a blow to
peace efforts and will encourage Israel to come down harder on the
Palestinian uprising.
   Suleiman Najab, a member of the PLO's ruling Executive
Committee, described the move by President Bush on Wednesday as a
``flagrant defiance of the Palestinians, Arabs and world peace.''
   In Jerusalem, an aide to right-wing Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir said Wednesday that the U.S. decision ``removed a major
obstacle'' to peace.
   Bush said he suspended the 18-month-old dialogue because the
Palestine Liberation Organization failed to forcefully condemn an
unsuccessful May 30 terrorist attack against Israel.
   The dialogue began after PLO chairman Yasser Arafat renounced
terrorism and accepted Israel's right to exist.
   Bush had urged Arafat to disavow the assault and to discipline
the PLO faction that sent two speedboats filled with fighters
toward a Tel Aviv beach. The boats were intercepted by Israel and
four guerrillas killed and 12 captured.
   Najab said in an interview in Baghdad, Iraq, that Bush's
decision will ``encourage Israel to commit more crimes and
massacres against our people in the occupied territories.''
   The PLO official spoke this morning after a pre-dawn meeting of
the 15-member Executive Committee. Najab and other committee
members were in Baghdad for a meeting on recent developments in the
Palestinian issue and to discuss the recent formation of the new
right-wing Israeli Cabinet.
   In Tunis, Salah Khalaf, regarded as the PLO's second-in-command,
was quoted Wednesday by the French news agency Agence France-Presse
as saying Bush's move would ``freeze peace efforts and reinforce
extremist forces'' in the Middle East.
   Jamil Hilal, who heads the PLO information department, said in a
telephone interview from Tunis, where the PLO has its headquarters,
that the suspension of the dialogue ``can be judged only as an
unfriendly and colonial move. ... It's a blow to the peace process
and a provocation to Arab states.''
   Hilal said he expects the PLO, in retaliation for the suspension
of talks, to call on Arab nations ``to apply economic sanctions
against the United States. I expect the uprising in the occupied
territories to escalate.''
   Avi Pazner, a top aide to Shamir, praised Bush's decision to end
the dialogue.
   It's ``an important and positive decision as far as the peace
process in the area is concerned,'' he said in Jerusalem. ``The PLO
was a major obstacle to peace and now that obstacle is removed.''
   In the occupied West Bank, Jamil Tarifi, a pro-PLO Palestinian
leader who has been named as a possible peace negotiator, condemned
the U.S. move.
   ``Anyone who wants to talk to the Palestinians must talk with
the PLO,'' he added.

   After six days of cleaning up from flash
floods, about 900 residents gathered beneath menacing skies to
mourn 22 people killed in the flooding, which also left 11 people
missing.
   Townspeople sang hymns, said prayers and held each other close
Wednesday during a 45-minute memorial service at their high school
football field. Children cried aloud; adults wept quietly.
   ``Friends and neighbors, please don't hush your babies. Let them
cry, let them sing, let them play,'' Gov. Richard Celeste said.
   ``In these sometimes beautiful, sometimes hard hills along the
Ohio River that we call home, be sure there is a special place in
heaven for those family members we remember tonight,'' the governor
said. ``But let us build a special place for those here who survive
with pain. I love you. God bless you.''
   Twenty-one uniformed members of the Shadyside Volunteer Fire
Department, who have been searching for victims and clearing
wreckage, received a standing ovation as they walked onto the field
single file.
   The Army Corps of Engineers today was to begin removing about 15
acres of flood debris from the Hannibal locks and dam, about 25
miles downstream from Shadyside.
   The list of missing had dwindled to 11 _ four local residents
who coroner's investigator Chuck Vogt said were likely dead and
seven out-of-towners who would be harder to account for.
   ``It hurts us all. You got to remember, we're a family here,''
Vogt said. ``We may not be a close one sometimes, but we are a
family. And we'll help each other and recover from this. In a few
weeks, all these government agencies will be gone and we'll be on
our own again.''
   In the stands, relatives of the dead sobbed as the Rev. Charles
Brewer of First Presbyterian Church read a roster of those killed
and missing.
   Two roses rested on the pulpit _ a red one for adults, a yellow
one for children.
   Janet Polivka, whose 13-year-old daughter, Kerri, died in the
flood, held a woman seated beside her and wept bitterly as the
crowd sang ``Amazing Grace.''
   Vogt, a lifelong Shadyside resident who has worked 16- to
20-hour days since the night of the flood to help recover and
identify bodies, stood alone behind reporters. He crouched at the
edge of the field and fought back tears.
   One hour before the service, Vogt identified the 22nd flood
victim as Stephen Gatten, 9, who had lived along Wegee Creek. His
body was found Wednesday in the Ohio River two miles downstream
from the creek. Stephen's brother also was killed in the flood, and
their mother was among the missing.

   A 9-year-old who rode a wall of water that
destroyed her home and clung to debris in the Ohio River for seven
hours said she had one last thing to say to her baby sitter, who
died.
   ``I'll just tell her `I love you,''' Amber Colvin said Wednesday
night before she and her mother visited a funeral home in nearby
Shadyside to pay respects to the family of 13-year-old Kerri
Polivka.
   Kerri and Amber were alone at the Colvin home along Wegee Creek,
just south of Shadyside, when a flash flood wiped out most of their
neighborhood.
   At least 22 people were killed after 5{ inches of rain fell in
about 3 hours June 14 onto the hilly coal fields whose runoff feeds
into Wegee and Pipe creeks.
   ``Water started coming into the house, the walls started to
break and things started to float,'' Amber said. ``We saw water all
over the house. Kerri was screaming and running around, and I told
her to keep calm, but she said, `I can't, I can't. I'm going to
die.'''
   The girls climbed into a bathtub in hopes of using it as a boat,
but it broke in two as the swift water tore the house apart, Amber
said.
   She said Kerri hit her head on the tub and sank. She twice tried
to grab Kerri by the hair and pull her out of the water, but went
under herself each time.
   She said she could feel the house being washed down the creek
before it broke apart. She floated away from it and grabbed onto a
log and some wooden shingles.
   She paddled to shore before dawn Friday, about six miles
downstream from where her home had been.
   ``I'm supposed to start swimming lessons next week. I can doggie
paddle a little, but I only had to do that once,'' she said.
   Her father, Dennis Colvin, 47, said he did not believe he would
see Amber alive.
   ``I'd gone down there after the water went down enough and there
was just a hole where the house was,'' he said. ``I'd resigned
myself to it. I didn't lose hope, but I kept looking at it with
reality.''

   Forty-four ``Redwood Summer'' demonstrators
were arrested at a lumber mill in a protest against logging
practices they say endanger California's old forests.
   About 350 took part in the protest at Louisiana Pacific on
Wednesday, the first day of a summer-long series of demonstrations
by environmentalists who have come to California from around the
country.
   The demonstrations are modeled on the Freedom Summer of 1964,
during which civil rights activists converged on Mississippi.
   Many of those arrested Wednesday marched onto company property
and approached officers so they could be taken into custody. Deputy
Sheriff Leona Mendenhall said most were issued citations for
trespassing and released.
   The rally was organized by Earth First!, which is known for
tactics such as standing between loggers and trees. The group
renounced its practice of driving spikes into trees to make them
useless as lumber after sawmill workers were injured by broken saws.
   Mainstream environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, have
refused to take part in Redwood Summer and have disavowed the
tactics of Earth First!
   Redwood Summer organizers are demanding an end to what they say
is excessive clear-cut logging, and cutting of virgin redwood trees.
   The demonstration was largely peaceful, with only sporadic
name-calling from passing motorists and between protesters and
lumber mill employees.
   ``We've got to save what's left of the forests,'' said David
Solnit, 26, a carpenter from San Francisco. ``They (Louisiana
Pacific) are acting like outlaws and we need to take direct
action.''
   Duane Plant, a lumber worker who carried a sign denouncing
``environmental terrorists,'' said that the Louisiana Pacific had
engaged in proper cutting techniques and that the protesters didn't
understand how the industry works.
   Samoa is about 275 miles north of San Francisco.
   In Sierra County, about 250 miles southeast of Samoa in the
Sierra Nevada, Sheriff Lee Adams said two Sacramento men were
arrested after reports of shooting near a logging site near
Downieville.
   No one was hit. Adams said investigators were trying to
determine if the shots were an attempt to halt the logging. He said
the two men were apparently not involved with any anti-logging
organization.

   Cloudy skies early today signaled more thunderstorms in the
central Plains and parts of the Midwest.
   The Southeast had more sweltering heat in store after
record-breaking highs Wednesday in parts of Florida and Georgia.
   Temperatures were expected to remain high in those states and in
Arkansas.
   Rain and thunderstorms continued Wednesday night in Louisiana,
Georgia, Florida, Arkansas, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee,
Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania,
New York state, New England, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota,
Nebraska, Wyoming and Montana.
   A tornado touched down Wednesday near Margate, Fla., but there
were no reports of injuries or damage, the National Weather Service
said.
   Heavy thunderstorms were expected today in the central Plains
and parts of the Midwest. Kansas storms Tuesday night had some
Witchita residents doing without power late Wednesday. Statewide,
at least 30 people were injured.
   The heat in Georgia forced a ban on watering in Atlanta, where
authorities cut water service to 1,000 or more homes for several
hours Wednesday to avert a crisis at hospitals.
   The high Wednesday in the Lower 48 states was 116 degrees in the
California cities of Thermal and Palm Springs.

   The dollar rose slightly in steady trading today,
although traders said they did not expect it to break out of its
narrow range. Gold rose slightly.
   ``The dollar has gathered some strength from (Soviet President
Mikhail) Gorbachev's threats to resign and by the likelihood that
U.S. interest rates will remain steady for a while,'' one dealer in
Milan said.
   Some traders said much of Wednesday's euphoria connected with
the prospects of the British pound's introduction this year into
the European exchange rate mechanism has faded. The pound had
benefited for several days from the speculation.
   ``People are taking a more realistic view of the timetable,
which isn't likely to be before the end of this year,'' a trader in
Milan said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.62 yen to a closing 154.60 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 154.87 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.6823 West German marks, up from 1.6785
   _1.4163 Swiss francs, up from 1.4155
   _5.6500 French francs, up from 5.6405

   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.7221, compared
with $1.7225 late Wednesday.
   Gold dealers in London fixed a recommended price of $350.10 an
ounce this morning, up from 349.15 bid late Wednesday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $350.20, up from $347.25 late

<HEAD>Baker in Berlin Holding Talks with Germans Before Unification
Meeting</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III headed
for back-to-back talks today with the foreign ministers of the two
Germanys to go over military and legal questions raised by
impending unification.
   On Baker's agenda was a proposal by West Germany and France to
provide economic aid to the Soviet economy.
   The help is designed to assist Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev in his perestroika program, with the hope the Kremlin
leader would drop his objections to NATO membership for a united
Germany.
   But a senior U.S. official said the Bush administration had not
decided whether to support the proposal, whose details were not
immediately available. He said there was ``a distinct possibility''
that the United States would not take part.
   The West German government several months ago took the lead in
offering to help Gorbachev cope with his economic woes.
   The Bonn-based newspaper Die Welt reported today that West
Germany plans to give Moscow more than $3 billion in credit to
support development of an open market.
   Baker's separate meetings with foreign ministers Markus Meckel
of East Germany and Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany were to
deal with the NATO issue and also procedures for the Big Four
Allies of World II _ the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain
and France _ to relinquish their control of Berlin.
   Baker, who arrived in Berlin on this morning, also will meet
separately with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze on
Friday.
   He is in Berlin for two days of ``two-plus-four'' talks that
bring together the four victors of World War II and the two
Germanys, who are set to merge their economies July 2 and may hold
all-German elections in December.
   French President Francois Mitterrand said Tuesday he would ask
the United States and five other major industrial democracies to
consider extending financial and technical aid to the Soviets at an
economic summit in Houston next month.
   Baker, officials said, also was weighing other assurances to
allay Moscow's concerns over a united Germany's membership in NATO.
   Officials said those assurances included issuance of
declarations by NATO and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact designed to
reflect the lowering of East-West tensions and the prospective
withdrawal of tens of thousands of U.S. and Soviet troops from
Europe.
   Gorbachev's economic problems are apt to be compounded when East
Germany is absorbed by West Germany. There are an estimated 380,000
Soviet troops in East Germany. Some would stay for a transitional
period under a U.S. proposal Baker took up with Shevardnadze in
Copenhagen.
   But the Soviets would be limited to no more than 195,000
soldiers in all of Central Europe, including what is now East
Germany, under a treaty being negotiated in Vienna by NATO and the
Warsaw Pact.
   The return of the troops would strain the Soviet budget both in
terms of housing them and finding jobs for those mustered out of
the service as part of a cutback of 500,000 men promised by
Gorbachev in December 1988.

<HEAD>Government Trying To Overturn Decision To Put VOA Station On Hold</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cabinet ministers hope to reverse a decision
delaying construction of a Voice of America radio relay station for
a two-year study of bird migration, communications officials said
today.
   The National Planning Board voted Tuesday to commission the
study of bird migration patterns before making a final decision on
the $300 million project. The relay station, designed to transmit
VOA broadcasts to Eastern Europe and Africa, would be located in
the Arava desert area on the southeastern tip of Israel.
   Twice a year, large numbers of birds fly over the Arava in their
trips back and forth between Africa and the northern hemisphere.
Israeli environmentalists opposing the VOA transmitter say it would
disturb the migrating birds.
   The United States and Israel signed an agreement in 1987 to
build the transmitter for the U.S. government-run Voice of America.
The project is expected to create hundreds of jobs and give an
economic boost to the sparsely populated Arava area.
   U.S. officials expressed disappointed by the decision to delay
construction.
   ``The issue of possible damage to migrating birds from
short-wave transmitters has been well-studied,'' a U.S. Embassy
statement said.
   ``The reasons for implementing the agreement signed by our two
nations in 1987 remain valid,'' it said. ``Events in Eastern Europe
and elsehwere have underscored the major role international radio
can play in fostering democracy.''
   Communications Ministry spokeswoman Naama Henig said her
ministry, the Foreign Ministry and Cabinet Secretary Eliyakim
Rubinstein are working out a strategy to overturn the National
Planning Board decision, which passed by a vote of 8-6 with one
abstention.
   She said one possibility was to call for a new vote on the
subject, noting that only 15 members of the 31-member panel were
present for Tuesday's vote.
   But she said the initiative must come from a National Planning
Board member, and that no request for a new vote had been made.
   The board, which includes representatives of 11 government
ministries, must approve all major national construction projects.

   Tamil rebels launched heavy attacks on
northern military installations today and the government rushed in
reinforcements for what could be a decisive battle in Sri Lanka's
civil war.
   More than 1,400 combatants have been killed since the separatist
conflict in the country's north and east exploded into full-scale
war again 10 days ago, the government said. No figures were given
for civilian casualties, also believed to be high.
   Additional soldiers were sent by air and sea to the northern
city of Jaffna to bolster defenses at two naval bases, a military
airfield and an army garrison, said Deputy Defense Minister Ranjan
Wijeratne. He refused to give figures.
   Tamil Tiger rebels today attacked the bases, airfield and
garrison with rocket-propelled grenades, automatic weapons and
suicide squads of guerrillas carrying explosives, Tamil sources
said on condition of anonymity.
   The sources said the militants were mustering men and weapons
for an all-out onslaught on Jaffna Fort, where the largest military
garrison in the region is located.
   Jaffna, a rebel stronghold, is on the northern tip of this
island nation and 200 miles north of the capital Colombo.
   The government claimed to have recaptured all major towns in the
east this week.
   ``Right now we have liberated the entire eastern province which
includes the districts of Ampara, Batticaloa and Trincomalee,''
minister Wijeratne told reporters in Colombo.
   He said that despite the fighting, the government is determined
to go ahead with political moves to grant greater political and
administrative autonomy to the Tamil minority in the north and east.
   ``We regard the fighting as a minor aberration. The political
process will go on,'' Wijeratne said.
   The government appealed to foreign governments for urgent
medical assistance.
   Government forces, under orders to crush the rebels ``wherever
they exist,'' were using helicopter gunships and bombing runs by
ground support planes to defend the northern bases, military
officials said.
   The 200-year-old Dutch fort in Jaffna has been under severe
pressure from the dominant Tamil Tiger rebels since fighting broke
out between the rebels and government troops on June 11.
   The Defense Ministry says several attacks on the fort have been
repulsed. About 150 troops and police defend the 55-acre stronghold.
   The latest round of fighting broke out June 11 after a Tamil
resident in the eastern town of Batticaloa complained he had been
manhandled by Sinhalese police. Tamil tigers then overran a police
station and combat escalated from there.
   Sri Lanka's Tamils make up 18 percent of the country's 16
million people. The Sinhalese make up 75 percent of the population.
   Military officials, including Defense Secretary Gen. Cyril
Ranatunge, said that since June 11, 800 rebels, 278 policemen and
219 troops have been killed. They did not say where or when the
deaths occurred. In addition, at least 500 policemen who
surrendered to the rebels are missing.
   Officials say civilian casualty figures are unknown but also
high since the military relied on air attacks to neutralize rebel
positions in populated cities in the north and east.
   Rebel statements issued by their London office claim that more
than 100,000 Tamils and Moslems have fled their homes in the region
this month.
   The Tamil rebels are fighting for autonomy in the northern and
eastern portion of the Indian Ocean island nation. The mainly Hindu
Tamils say they are discriminated against by the Buddhist Sinhalese
majority.
   The rebels had taken control of most major towns of the region
after Indian troops trying to enforce a peace agreement withdrew in
March. The pullout, made at the request of President Ranasinghe
Premadasa, followed the Indians' unsuccessful 32-month attempt to
disarm the Tamil Tigers.
   At least 11,000 people have been killed since Tamil militants
began fighting for an independent nation in 1983. In 1987, India
brokered a peace accord between the two sides and sent a force to
disarm the rebels. Fighting ensued and the Indian troops were
withdrawn in March of this year.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   French judges, barred by law from striking,
postponed trials and staged protests across France today in an
unprecedented walkout organized to demand more autonomy and better
working conditions.
   The ``day of national action'' marked the first coordinated
protest by French judges on behalf of their profession. A majority
of the 6,000 judges participated, and only urgent criminal cases
were heard in several cities.
   The judges say the judiciary has been degraded by inadequate
facilities, budget restrictions and an excessive workload.
   The three unions of judges, usually divided by political
differences, all supported the one-day protest. One of them, the
left-wing Syndicat de la Magistrature, called on members to strike
in defiance of a 1958 statute, while the moderate and rightist
unions advised members to find some legal way of expressing
discontent.
   In Paris and other major cities, judges abandoned their chambers
to attend union rallies.
   ``Justice for the courts of justice,'' read a banner at a
protest attended by robed judges in Strasbourg.
   Union leaders contend that the workload for judges has increased
steadily even though France now has fewer judges for its 56 million
people than in 1914, when the population of 39 million was served
by 6,600 judges.
   The unions also have demanded statutory reforms to lessen
executive branch control over the judiciary. Also, they have
complained about a government-backed amnesty law which requires
judges to drop charges against various politicians involved in
alleged fundraising scandals.
   The protests took place despite an appeal Wednesday from Justice
Minister Pierre Arpaillange, who asked that court operations not be
disrupted. He promised that the government would adopt a major
courthouse construction and renovation program to start by next
year.
   Michael Joubrel, president of the moderate Union Syndicale des
Magistrates, said the protest was not aimed at the Justice Ministry.
   ``It's not the courts that will be held hostage, but the
Ministry of Finance, which possesses the means of improving
justice,'' he said.
   Although the protesting judges contend that the government
should allocate more on the court system _ it now gives 1.36
percent of the national budget _ they are not specifically
demanding a pay raise. Most judges currently earn the equivalent of
between $30,000 and $60,000 annually.
   The only previous coordinated protests by judges, according to
French newspapers, were organized to denounce disciplinary actions
taken against colleagues.

<TEXT>
   A man who won a year's use of a
$30,000 Lincoln Town Car said thanks but no thanks _ the luxury
sedan may suit urban commuters but doesn't fit the rugged lifestyle
in his remote hometown.
   ``This is battered, rusty pickup truck country,'' said Bruce
Cain, 33, an accountant in the town of about 500 residents 190
miles northeast of Anchorage.
   ``Between frost swells and holes in the road and temperatures
that can reach minus 50 in the winter, a Town Car would be a bit
impractical _ and eccentric,'' he said
   ``It's too ritzy for Glennallen,'' said his wife, Shirley.
   Use of the car was a prize in an Alaska Airlines promotional
game.
   ``It just doesn't fit the lifestyle,'' Cain said. ``What would
that car look like after an entire year up here? I drive $500
pickups.''
   Budget Rent A Car Corp., which would have provided the car,
instead sent Cain a check. The amount was not disclosed.
   ``Everything worked out nicely,'' said Budget spokeswoman Ellie
Bennett. ``Bruce didn't want the car and we weren't too optimistic
about its long-term health.''

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Final results of last month's election
in Burma will be delayed because bad weather has hampered access to
remote areas, Burmese state radio said.
   Official results through Wednesday show the opposition National
League for Democracy taking 396 of the 485 seats in the National
Assembly.
   The May 27 poll was the first multiparty election in three
decades. Some Western diplomats in Rangoon have said the military
government may be intentionally delaying the final results because
of a reluctance to hand over power.
   The government said before the election that it would take up to
three weeks for the final results.
   Rangoon Radio on Wednesday broadcast a statement issued by the
Elections Commission saying it was awaiting results from five
remote constituencies in the far northern states of Sagaing and
Kachin. A transcript of the broadcast was seen in Bangkok today.
   ``Although efforts have been made to obtain reports about the
elections from those townships with the help of military
helicopters, weather conditions have so far prevented the trips,''
the commission's statement said.
   It said messengers had been sent by land, ``but there have been
delays because of mudslides on mountain roads and because some
bridges have been washed away.''
   ``As soon as they are obtained, the commission will resume
announcing the names of the candidates elected,'' it said.
   The statement did not say how long that would take.
   Foreign diplomats said the polling appeared to have been
conducted fairly but was preceded by the detention of thousands of
dissidents.
   Many Burmese distrust the military government. Soldiers killed
thousands of people demanding democracy in 1988.

   Scientists today said an apelike creature that
lived 10 million years ago may be the earliest known direct
ancestor of humans.
   The claim met sharp skepticism from experts who said they were
unconvinced by the researchers' anatomical analysis of a remnant of
the creature's skull.
   ``I don't believe for a minute'' that the beast is a direct
human ancestor, Peter Andrews of the Natural History Museum in
London said Wednesday in a telephone interview.
   The analysis also implies that ancestors of humans may have
started evolving away from ancestors of chimps and gorillas
millions of years earlier than many scientists believe.
   It is presented in the British journal Nature by L. de Bonis of
the University of Poitiers in France, G. Bouvrain and D. Geraads of
the University of Paris, and G. Koufos of the University of
Thessaloniki in Greece.
   The fossil, found last September in Greece, is thought to be 9
million to 10 million years old. It represents a previously known
animal called Ouranopithecus macedoniensis.
   The fossil includes the right part and a portion of the left
part of an adult's face, plus the upper jaw with most of the teeth,
the researchers said.
   They said the fossil's anatomy suggests that Ouranopithecus
macedoniensis appeared on the human branch of the evolutionary tree
after that lineage split from the ancestors of gibbons, orangutans,
gorillas and chimpanzees.
   That would make it a direct ancestor of humans.
   The researchers also suggested that the human lineage may have
started evolving away from the ancestors of chimps and gorillas as
long as 12 million years ago.
   Other scientists have put that split at 5 million to 7 million
years ago, said Lawrence Martin, assistant professor in
antholopology at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.
   Martin, who has studied other fossils from Ouranopithecus
macedoniensis, said he is ``absolutely sure'' the new study is
wrong in assigning the beast to the human lineage.
   Martin said he puts the beast further back in evolution, before
the human lineage started evolving away from ancestors of
chimpanzees and gorillas.

   House Republicans kept the House in session
all through the night, ``just like a telethon,'' to talk about
drugs and tough punishment for users and other proposals for
combatting crime in America.
   The speeches began at 7:15 p.m. Wednesday and continued until
after 8 a.m. as member after member took the lectern to address a
nearly-empty House chamber. But television cameras broadcast the
session to a nationwide audience over C-Span, the congressional
cable channel.
   One participant, Rep. Robert Livingston of Louisiana, described
the all-night session as being ``just like a telethon.''
   Indeed, some of the members propped before them a poster with
the hand-lettered words ``Crime Watch'' and a telephone number for
Americans to call as the night wore on to report crimes in their
cities.
   ``That number again is 202-224-3121,'' was heard more than once
as members urged watchers to call.
   Before it started, Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., called the
session ``total nonsense'' and a ``politically motivated activity''
because ``we are going to pass a major crime bill this year.''
   There was no indication how many people called, or how many were
watching the all-night show, which began after the House had
concluded the day's regular legislative business.
   Shortly after 2 a.m., Rep. Jack Fields of Texas was agreeing
with several earlier speakers that more jail cells for drug users
was the answer and said they should be uncomfortable places that
are ``hot in summer and cold in winter.''
   He said mosquito-infested regions of Texas and Louisiana would
be good places for prisons _ and that inmates should not be given
insect repellent. He also said it might be a good idea for them to
be housed in tents _ tents with holes in them.
   Rep. Jim McCrery of Louisiana said cocaine is sometimes smuggled
across the Mexican border concealed in red cans purported to
contain tomatoes.
   ``The chief threat to our security in the 1990s may well come
from hordes of red tomato cans rather than hordes of red
communists,'' he said.
   Rep. Susan Molinari of New York criticized Gov. Mario Cuomo for
opposing the death penalty. At 6 a.m. _ sounding like a telethon
host _ she announced, ``We now shift coasts'' and turned the
program over to Rep. Dana Rohrabacher of California.
   The No. 2 House Republican, Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia went
live on NBC's ``Today'' at 7:09 for a network finale.
   ``I'm glad the speaker made the commitment ... that he is
willing to bring up the bill,'' Gingrich said on ``Today.''
   ``So maybe we have made some progress during the night but we
are determined if necessary to do this again in July or August to
continue to make the point that the Democratic leadership, after a
year of holding up the president's crime and drug package, owes it
to the American people to bring it to the floor of the House,''
Gingrich said.
   In an apparent preemptive response to the Republicans'
talkathon, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jack Brooks, D-Texas,
announced in advance that comprehensive anti-crime legislation will
be considered next week by the panel's subcommittee on crime.
   The crime bill would expand use of the death penalty for federal
crimes including presidential assassination, strengthen controls
over chemicals needed to manufacture certain drugs and toughen
criminal sanctions on those distributing anabolic steroids.

   In punishing the Palestine Liberation
Organization for violence, the United States may have opened the
door to even more violence. Even President Bush recognized that
irony when he announced his decision to suspend the 18-month U.S.
dialogue with the PLO.
   Bush said Wednesday the United States must respond to the PLO's
violation of its pledge to renounce terrorism _ the magic words
that led the Reagan administration in its waning days to lift a
13-year ban on direct talks with the PLO.
   And Bush promised that as soon as the PLO condemns the thwarted
May 30 attack by PLO guerrillas on Israel's coast, the United
States will resume the talks.
   Nonetheless, analysts agree the suspension of the talks has
badly damaged the tentative results of the low-level dialogue
conducted in virtual secrecy in Tunis, where the PLO has its
headquarters.
   ``This will make the radicals and all those who oppose peace,
strong,'' said Faisal Husseini, one of the leading Palestinian
nationalists in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
   Assistant Secretary of State John Kelly told a House panel
Wednesday that cutting off dialogue with the PLO will harm the
Middle East peace process, adding, ``It may herald a period of time
in which there is more violence and more terrorism.''
   Bush, asked whether he was worried about playing into the hands
of PLO hardliners, said, ``Yes, I am concerned about that.'' And
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who recommended the
suspension, acknowledged it would hurt moderate Arabs.
   The president said he recognized the frustration among
Palestinians at the slow pace of the dialogue, but he cited
achievements.
   ``On balance, we believe that these exchanges contributed to
progress in the peace process,'' he said in announcing his
decision. ``I think things are better because we've had the
dialogue.''
   Analysts say the dialogue proved to Americans that the PLO was
the only representative of the Palestinian people and therefore
vital to the success of Arab-Israeli peace talks. U.S. influence
also got the PLO to accept negotiations with its archenemy, Israel.
   ``We were just starting to drive the demons out of each others'
eyes,'' said Richard Murphy, the leading Mideast official in the
Reagan administration.
   For Palestinians, long shunned in the West as terrorists bent on
the destruction of Israel, the dialogue provided a modicum of
legitimacy.
   And it showed Palestinians that U.S. foreign policy was not
warped by its support for the Jewish state, Murphy said in an
interview.
   U.S. officials said last summer they were closer to arranging
talks between Israel and the Palestinians than ever before.
   The plan advanced by Baker would have brought together Israeli
officials and Palestinians whose participation was approved by the
PLO.
   The talks, to be held in Cairo, would have set up elections
among the 1.7 million Palestinians under Israeli occupation.
   For the mainstream of the PLO, which includes some factions
radically opposed to the dialogue with Israel, the acceptance of
talks with Israel was a major concession.
   ``We lose sight of the fact that Arafat did something we
predicted no Palestinian would do,'' Bush said.
   But Israel balked at accepting some of the proposed Palestinian
negotiators because of their anti-Israel activity.
   The United States appealed for help last summer from Egypt _ the
only Arab country which has made peace with Israel.
   Besides advancing the peace process, the other U.S. objective in
the dialogue was to bring about an end to PLO terrorism. U.S.
Ambassador Robert Pelletreau often would bring up suspected
terrorist incidents with a PLO official named Hakam Balaoui, and
ask for explanations.
   The State Department cited results, reporting to Congress that
while 30 border and rocket attacks were launched by Palestinian
groups against Israel since December 1988, there was no evidence
any were authorized by the PLO Executive Committee.
   But ultimately, the suspension of the dialogue was prompted by
the very obstacle that prevented direct talks with the PLO since
its inception in 1964 _ terrorism.

   Here are a few tips from the Consumer Product Safety Commission
on handling fireworks safely:
   _Check with state and local authorities to find out which
fireworks are legal in your area.
   _Read the labels for fireworks carefully when you buy them. If
they don't have caution labels, don't buy them because they
probably don't meet other safety standards.
   _Don't use fireworks in crowded areas, or near dry grass or
combustible material such as gasoline or charcoal lighter fluid.
   _Never place your face or other part of your body over fireworks
devices and don't try to use them if you have been using alcohol or
other drugs.
   _Supervise children and never give fireworks, even sparklers, to
very young children.
   _Avoid multiple-firecracker ``salutes,'' particularly M-80's and
cherry bombs.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Palestinian women and masked youths
battled riot police in Arab east Jerusalem today after the fatal
shooting of an Arab man by police in an earlier protest there.
   Paramilitary border police, backed by a helicopter, fired rubber
bullets and tear gas to disperse the rioters who threw stones,
blocked roads, burned tires and spilled oil on the streets of the
hilly Silwan neighborhood.
   In one battle, border police fired tear gas at a dozen
Palestinian women who chanted ``You maniacs, get out of here,
you've killed our kids.''
   Graffiti painted on walls vowed to avenge the death of the slain
Arab, 20-year-old Said Mohammed Naim Fatafta. ``Mohammed, don't
worry, we'll teach the Jews a lesson,'' read one slogan, with a gun
painted next to it.
   Another slogan read: ``The Americans are our biggest enemy.''
   Wednesday night's stone-throwing protest in Silwan came as first
reports emerged that President Bush had decided to suspend the
18-month American dialogue with the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   Black flags of mourning and outlawed Palestinian flags fluttered
from rooftops of Silwan and the neighboring Abu Tor area.
   Three protesters were treated for rubber bullet injuries and
released, said doctors at east Jerusalem's Mukassed Hospital.
Police said several protesters were arrested.
   Pro-PLO underground leaders of the Palestinian uprising declared
a three-day strike in east Jerusalem to protest Fatafta's death
Wednesday night.
   He was the seventh Palestinian to be killed in Jerusalem during
the 30-month-old revolt against Israeli occupation. At least six
Israelis have been slain in Jerusalem during the uprising.
   While most of the violence in the revolt has come in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, Palestinians have regularly
demonstrated in east Jerusalem.
   The area was captured from Jordan along with the West Bank in
the 1967 Middle East war. Israel annexed the area, but most Western
nations, including the United States, do not recognize the action.
Palestinians want east Jerusalem to be the capital of a Palestinian
state.
   The Silwan area is an Arab village that was annexed along with
east Jerusalem.
   Fatafta was dead on arrival at the Mukassed Hospital late
Wednesday night. Hospital officials said today he was shot in the
chest and stomach by live ammunition. They quoted his companions as
saying he was hit by paramilitary border police who broke up a
stone-throwing protest.
   Jerusalem border police commander Yossi Tubias said his troops
fired live ammunition in Silwan Wednesday after they were attacked
by about 25 masked Palestinians armed with chains, iron bars and
stones.
   Israel radio had initially quoted border police as saying that
forces fired tear gas and rubber bullets, not live ammunition.
   Fatafta's death brought to 718 the number of Palestinians killed
by Israeli soldiers, police or civilians during the uprising.
Forty-five Israelis have been slain by Palestinians.
   In the Gaza Strip refugee camp of Rafah, assailants stabbed and
axed to death 23-year-old Tamin al Hamayda on suspicion that he
helped Israeli authorities and was a drug dealer, Arab reporters
said. Hamayda's body was found dumped in a Rafah street today.
   An army official confirmed the death and said the circumstances
were being investigated by police.
   Hamayda's death brought to 225 the number of Palestinians slain
by fellow Arabs, most on charges they collaborated with Israeli
authorities.

<TEXT>
   East Germany today overwhelmingly
approved a treaty merging its economy with West Germany's, marking
the biggest and most difficult step toward unification and the end
of 40 years of socialism.
   The vote in the East German Parliament for the historic treaty
was 302-82, with one abstension.
   Earlier in the day, East German lawmakers declared a united
Germany would not seek to reclaim former lands ceded to Poland
after World War II.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl urged lawmakers in his
country to also pass the economic treaty and to promise that
Poland's borders were secure.
   The actions came as the parliaments of the two German states met
simultaneously in their respective capitals to take final action on
the treaty merging the economies of the Germanys by July 2.
   The treaty comes after months of work at break-neck speed
following the collapse late last year of East Germany's Communist
government and the fall of the Berlin Wall. East Germany elected a
non-Communist government in March headed by Prime Minister Lothar
de Maiziere.
   On July 2, the powerful West German mark becomes the official
tender for both countries, and East Germany moves toward a
free-market economy.
   Political unification is now seen as a possibility before year's
end.
   Under the treaty, economic union will be based on a free-market
economy, including private property, competition and full freedom
for workers. The West German Bundesbank, or central bank, will have
responsibility for all monetary policy.
   Wages, salaries and pensions will be converted to West German
marks at a 1-1 exchange rate.
   All other savings will be converted at two East German marks for
one West German mark. Debts will also be converted at a 2-1 rate,
which is more favorable to troubled East German companies.
   In Bonn, Kohl opened a scheduled 13-hour debate on the economic
treaty.
   ``The treaty shows the way to German unity, and whoever doesn't
follow this road sign doesn't want unity,'' Kohl said.
   Leftist opposition forces in West Germany say Kohl is rushing
too quickly with German unification.
   Kohl on Monday said 1990 would ``be the year of German unity,''
and his Christian Democratic Party has called for united German
elections in early December.
   The opposition Social Democrats insist that the economic treaty
fails to go far enough in supporting East German businesses, which
will be hard-pressed to compete with West German companies.
   Some experts have predicted up to 2 million unemployed in East
Germany as outmoded government-owned factories and businesses try
to compete. More than a third of the enterprises are expected to
close and there are fears social unrest could result.
   Six members of the 400-member East German Parliament voted
against the guarantee of Poland's borders and 18 abstained.
   The resolution urged Poland to guarantee the rights and culture
of millions of ethnic Germans living in Poland. A third of
present-day Poland was once German territory.
   Lawmakers from the arch-conservative German Social Union sought
a stronger resolution demanding that ethnic Germans in Poland have
cultural independence and their own schools.
   In Bonn, Kohl strongly urged passage of the declaration
recognizing Poland's western border, although he acknowledged that
the move was painful for some Germans.
   Up until a few months ago, there was widespread international
concern that Germany would try to regain some of the lands ceded to
Poland after the war.
   ``The German-Polish border is final,'' Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher told lawmakers.
   Still to be decided is the strategic future of a united Germany.
The four World War II Allies that divided the country _ the United
States, Soviet Union, Britain and France _ are to hold a round of
unification talks in East Berlin on Friday.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir today urged the
United States to permanently end its dialogue with the PLO, and
Palestinians chanted anti-American slogans to protest President
Bush's suspension of the talks.
   Israeli newspapers said Bush's action Wednesday could mean more
American pressure on Israel to forge a new peace strategy.
   In Nablus, the occupied West Bank's largest city, dozens of
Palestinians marched though the crowded market area chanting, ``No
to America, No to Israel, Yes to the PLO.''
   At least one of the marchers carried a pistol and others covered
their faces with checked Palestinian kefiyyeh scarves, one witness
said.
   An anti-American march also was reported in the West Bank town
of Tulkarem.
   In Arab east Jerusalem's Silwan section, a Palestinian man was
killed when police opened fire Wednesday night on youths who
blocked streets with stones as news of the U.S. decision spread.
Hundreds of Palestinian women and masked youths battled riot police
in Silwan quarter today.
   Shamir, who initially expressed elation, today toned down his
response to Bush's announcement Wednesday that the U.S. dialogue in
Tunis would be suspended because the PLO did not condemn a
guerrilla raid on Israel's beachfront.
   ``I hope that the suspension will not be temporary, but instead
will open a new chapter in the relations between the U.S. and the
Middle East,'' Shamir said on Israel radio.
   He said that by only suspending the talks, instead of cutting
them off permanently, Washington still had not made clear its
determination to fight terrorism.
   ``Of course this raises doubts that maybe the U.S.
administration hasn't reached the clear conclusion that we are
talking about a terror organization,'' he said.
   Shamir's government has been pushing the United States to end
the dialogue it started with the Palestine Liberation Organization
in December 1988 after Arafat renounced terrorism and accepted
Israel's existence.
   Israeli newspapers bannered their front pages with Bush's
remarks, which were seen as a thaw in recently chilly U.S.-Israeli
relations.
   But analysts and editorial writers quickly noted that Bush had
suggested talks could be renewed once the PLO adequately condemns
the May 30 attack.
   A PLO faction, the Palestine National Front, has claimed
responsibility for the attack.
   The Haaretz daily quoted an anonymous senior official close to
Shamir as saying that now, the burden would be on Israel to take an
initiative in the peace process.
   The newspaper noted a letter that Bush sent to Shamir earlier
this week reportedly urging Israel to come up with new ideas.
   ``And Now, Pressure on Israel,'' read the headline on a
front-page analysis in the Yediot Ahronot daily.
   Palestinian leaders in east Jerusalem and the occupied lands
called Bush's announcement a death blow to already faltering peace
efforts.
   ``It is an indication that in this region there is going to be a
vacuum in the political process and encouragement to go to war,''
said Hannah Siniora, editor of the pro-PLO Arabic language daily Al
Fajr.
   Israel objects to any PLO involvement in peace efforts, claiming
the organization is a terrorist group bent on destroying the Jewish
state.

   Here, in summary form, are the Supreme Court's
two previous major decisions on political patronage.
   _In Elrod vs. Burns, a landmark 1976 ruling, the court greatly
limited the power of government employers to fire employees because
of their party affiliation.
   The court said only policy-makers and confidential employees
could be subjected to such politically motivated firings. The
ruling reinstated five low-level sheriff's employees in their Cook
County, Ill., jobs and protected numerous other employees _ on the
state and federal levels as well.
   _In a 1980 ruling called Branti vs. Finkel, the court went
further. It ruled that even some policy-makers and confidential
employees are protected against politically motivated firings.
   ``The ultimate inquiry is not whether the label ``policy-maker'
or `confidential' fits a particular position; rather, the question
is whether the hiring authority can demonstrate that party
affiliation is an appropriate requirement for effective performance
of the public office involved,'' Justice John Paul Stevens wrote
for the court.
   The decision upheld a lower court's order to reinstate two
part-time Rockland County, N.Y., public defenders who had been
fired by a new Democratic boss because they were Republicans.
   The still-active justices who joined Stevens in that 6-3
decisiotices Byron R. White, Thurgood
Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia,
Anthony M. Kennedy and Sandra Day O'Connor dissented.
   In a dissenting opinion, Scalia wrote, ``Today, the court makes
its constitutional civil-service reform absolute, extending to all
decisions regarding government employment.''
   In the Illinois case, two men and a woman who said their job
status suffered because they did not vote in Republican primaries
or give money to the party sued the governor, the state GOP and the
heads of several state agencies.
   Cynthia Rutan said she repeatedly was denied promotions to
supervisory positions in the state Rehabilitative Services
Department because she did not support Republican candidates.
   Franklin Taylor, an equipment operator, said he was denied an
Illinois Transportation Department transfer to another county
because party officials opposed it.
   James Moore said the state Corrections Department has refused to
hire him since 1978 because he could not get the backing of key GOP
leaders.
   The three sued for more than $1 billion in damages. Their suit
also seeks to shift control of the state employment system to a
court-appointed federal receiver.
   During oral arguments before the justices last January, their
lawyer, Mary Lee Leahy of Springfield, Ill., said Thompson's office
has controlled all new hires since 1980. In all, 62,000 civil
service jobs are under the governor's jurisdiction.
   She previously had submitted to the court a form used to screen
state employees who seek a promotion and live in Sangamon County.
   The form asks employees to declare how they, or in some cases
their parents, voted in primary elections. It also asks whether the
person would be willing to work for Republicans during an election.
   Lawyers for Thompson and state GOP leaders argued that hiring
political allies stimulates good government because the employee is
likely to appreciate the job and, in turn, serve the public well.
   Today's decision means all the lawsuits remain alive.
   Several groups from the state, including Independent Voters of
Illinois and Common Cause-Illinois, argued in a
``friend-of-the-court'' brief, ``A politically conditioned
employment system inhibits the free functioning of democracy,
rather than advancing it, since it seeks to assist only a single
favored political party and to dissuade all other political
activity.''
   In a similar brief, lawyers for the AFL-CIO said, ``Allocating
governmental resources purely in the interest of partisan politics
grants the favored party an advantage that threatens the legitimacy
of our governmental structure.''
   Lawyers for the commonwealth of Puerto Rico, however, urged the
justices to uphold the Illinois system.
   ``The prospect of employment is a significant incentive to
political effort (and) opportunities to implement the
administration's democratic mandate are enhanced significantly by
patronage hiring,'' the Puerto Rico lawyers contended.
   ``These are compelling state interests which outweigh the
possible First Amendment impairment resulting from patronage
hiring.''
   No other state filed a brief in support of the Illinois system.
   The cases are Rutan vs. Illinois Republican Party, 88-1872, and
Frech vs. Rutan, 88-2074.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today sentenced the
brother of former dictator Nicolae Ceausescu to 15 years in prison
for inciting mass murder during the December revolution that
toppled his brother's regime.
   Witnesses testified during the trial that they had seen Nicolae
Andruta Ceausescu shooting at demonstrators on December 21, the day
Bucharest residents joined in the revolution. He pleaded innocent.
   The revolution deposed his brother the next day, and the
Communist dictator and his wife, Elena, were executed on Dec. 25.
Today marked the six-month anniversary of the revolution.
   Andruta Ceausescu, a general and commander of a training school
for his brother's feared secret police, was sentenced to a total of
24 years on a variety of charges including inciting mass murder and
attempted aggravated murder.
   But Adrian Nitoiu, a member of the three-judge military panel
that conducted the trial, said some of the terms would run
consecutively, meaning Ceausescu would have to actually serve only
15 years.
   There is no separate pronouncement of a verdict under Romanian
law. A guilty finding is implicit in sentencing.

   Tens of thousands of rush-hour commuters were
stranded today when 14 subway stations were closed while workers
searched for the source of a gas leak.
   Stations were evacuated and a special train was run to shuttle
firemen, gas engineers and rail staff equipped with gas detection
equipment between stations.
   The smell was first detected at 7:30 a.m. at King's Cross, which
was immediately closed, as was neighbouring Euston _ both key

   Officials were unsure what caused the problem, a London

<HEAD>States, Energy Consumers Barred From Antitrust Suits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today generally barred
states and energy consumers from bringing federal antitrust suits
against energy producers accused of conspiring to fix prices.
   In a 5-4 ruling, the justices said only direct purchasers of
energy _ in this case utility companies _ may file such suits.
   The court ruled against Kansas and Missouri officials who
accused a natural gas pipeline and five natural gas producers of
illegal price fixing.
   The attorneys general of 32 states had urged the high court to
permit such suits.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the court, rejected
arguments that states or residential customers should be permitted
to sue because utilities lack incentive to go to court since they
can pass on any overcharges to their customers.
   ``Utilities ... have an established record of diligent antitrust
enforcement,'' Kennedy said. ``History makes us quite hesitant to
take from the utilities the responsibility for enforcing the
antitrust laws.''
   Also, he continued, ``Consumers may lack the expertise and
experience necessary for detecting improper pricing by a utility's
suppliers.''
   Kennedy added that state officials may hesitate to sue ``in
cases involving smaller, more speculative harm to consumers ... and
... they may sue only on behalf of'' state residents.
   Joining him were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices
John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia.
   Dissenting were Justices Byron R. White, William J. Brennan,
Thurgood Marshall and Harry A. Blackmun.
   Kansas and Missouri officials said in their suit that energy
producers conspired to inflate the price of the gas sold to
utilities and that the alleged overcharges were passed on to
consumers.
   Today's ruling was prompted in part by disagreement among lower
federal courts.
   The Bush administration, without taking sides, had urged the
high court earlier this year to resolve the uncertainty.
   Supporting the appeal by Kansas and Missouri were Alaska,
Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii,
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New
Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota,
Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and
Wisconsin.
   The case is Kansas vs. Utilicorp United Inc., 88-2109.

   The government's drug policy coordinator is
taking on critics who warn that the United States is heading for
``another Vietnam'' by giving South American countries military
help to battle cocaine traffickers.
   ``This is not an American invasion,'' William J. Bennett said in
a speech today to the Center for Strategic and International
Studies.
   ``It is not an escalating military intervention,'' Bennett said.
``Our policy is that there will be no U.S. military personnel
involved in operations.''
   The drug war must be fought at the source as well as on U.S.
streets, he said.
   ``If these efforts are caricatured as another Vietnam, an
American invasion or involvement in a foreign war, then we risk
crippling a series of strengthened relationships that our president
and the presidents of the Andean region have recently forged,''
Bennett said.
   He acknowledged that some Americans may die fighting the drug
war overseas.
   ``This is a dangerous enemy and we cannot expect to fight this
battle unscathed,'' Bennett said. ``We have already lost Americans
in fighting this battle in foreign countries. If we are not
prepared to face these risks in the future, then we should not
undertake to assist our allies.''
   Newspaper editorial writers, columnists and others have likened
the administratin's Andean strategy to early U.S. promises that
grew into the Vietnam war, but few such comments have been heard on
Capitol Hill.
   In a recent column in The New York Times, Tom Wicker wrote,
``Americans can sing, `It seems to me I've heard that song
before.'''
   The libertarian Cato Institute issued an analysis that concluded:
   ``Given the probable consequences of enlisting the military in
the war on drugs, and especially of deploying U.S. troops in the
source nations of Latin America, it is more likely to be the moral
_ and operational _ equivalent of America's disastrous Vietnam
intervention.''
   President Bush met in February with the presidents of Colombia,
Peru and Bolivia, and the four agreed that their countries would
work together against drug traffickers. Since then, Colombia and
Peru have elected new presidents.
   In Colombia, where the government has waged a bloody war against
drug traffickers since last August when traffickers were blamed for
killing a leading presidential hopeful, the people recently elected
the only candidate who strongly opposed the drug trade, Cesar
Gaviria.
   Peruvian President-elect Alberto Fujimori said during his
campaign that he would reject any ``foreign intervention'' in the
war against drugs, an apparent reference to U.S. plans to have
military advisers train Peruvian soldiers in anti-drug jungle
warfare.
   Fujimori, who must contend with a decade-long war with leftist
Shining Path guerrillas as well as cocaine traffickers, said he
favors economic support to military force to eradicate coca
plantations.
   Bennett said he hopes to complete a formal agreement soon with
Peru so the United States can start providing military equipment
and training to Peruvian police and military, but not economic
assistance, for now.
   Economic aid and trade are ``an integral part of our plan,''
Bennett said. But he added, ``No plan for crop substitution and
economic development, no matter how generous, can survive when the
farmer-peasants themselves live under the gun of domestic terror.''
   The United States is giving about $230 million to the three
Andean countries this year, all of it for law enforcement against
drug trafficking. The administration has proposed sending $430
million next year and plans to spend more in 1992, with economic
aid representing about half the aid in the next two years.
   For now, Bennett said, military assistance is needed in all
three countries ``to achieve a level of security that law
enforcement personnel alone cannot provide.''
   The Andean presidents ``despise drugs every bit as much as we
do,'' he said. ``And they are asking for our help to fight a common
enemy: cocaine. We have begun a partnership with them.
   ``The moment they tell us they don't want our help, we will step
aside and let them fight this battle on their own,'' Bennett said.

<HEAD>Finance Panel Completes Action on Foreign Apparel, Footwear Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Finance Committee today completed
action on a bill limiting imports of apparel and footwear but made
no recommendation on whether it should be passed.
   The bill is supported by a majority of members of the House and
Senate but there is some question whether the margins are large
enough to override a presidential veto. The Bush administration
opposes the bill and President Bush's advisers say they will
recommend a veto if it passes.
   President Reagan vetoed similar legislation in 1985 and 1988 and
both vetoes were sustained by Congress.
   Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., chief sponsor of the bill, said
it is necessary ``to prevent the outright extinction of the U.S.
textile, apparel and non-rubber footwear industry.''
   Sen. Bob Packwood of Oregon, senior Republican on the Finance
Committee, said, ``I cannot think of a single justifiable smidgen
of comment to say about this bill.'' He said it would violate
international trade agreements and send the wrong signal at a time
when the United States is pleading for free trade.
   The bill would limit 1990 imports of textiles and textile
products to 1 percent above last year's level and allow future
increases of 1 percentage point a year. Quotas on non-rubber shoes
would be frozen at 1989 levels.
   Under the legislation, countries that allow greater imports of
U.S. farm products would get preferential treatment when the annual
quota increases are allocated.
   Textiles and textile products from Canada and Israel would be
exempted from the limitations. The bill would guarantee that
Caribbean countries would always have a market share at least as
large as it was in 1989.
   Hollings argues that imports have 60 percent of the U.S. apparel
market and their share is growing by 12 percent a year. He said
that since President Reagan took office in 1981, nearly 1,500 U.S.
apparel companies have gone out of business and 400,000 American
workers have lost jobs in the industry.
   No one spoke for the bill as the Finance Committee agreed
unanimously to send it to the Senate without recommendation.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, the chairman, said he wanted to get
the legislation out of committee so that sponsors would not attempt
to attach it to other bills pending before the panel.

<HEAD>Court Reinstates Coach's Suit Against Ohio Newspaper</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today reinstated a former
wrestling coach's lawsuit against an Ohio newspaper, ruling that
allegedly libelous statements in the case can be treated as
assertions of fact, not merely opinion.
   But the 7-2 ruling did not appear to reduce significantly the
free-speech protections from libel law that ``opinion''
traditionally has been given by the nation's courts.
   For the first time, the court said the Constitution's First
Amendment does not require a special, separate privilege for stated
opinions.
   The decision makes clear, however, that the fact-opinion
distinction will remain important in libel cases, and courts may
continue to throw out lawsuits that seek damages for someone's
stated opinion.
   Led by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, the court overturned
an Ohio Supreme Court ruling that had thrown out Michael
Milkovich's 1975 suit against the News Herald of Lake County.
   The Willoughby-based newspaper, published by the Lorain Journal
Co., and onetime sports columnist Ted Diadiun, now an editor with
The Plain Dealer in Cleveland, were sued over a 1975 column that
accused Milkovich and a former high school administrator of lying
during a court hearing.
   Writing for the court today, Rehnquist said the First Amendment
protection of free speech did not ``create a wholesale defamation
exemption for anything that might be labeled opinion.''
   But Rehnquist added that 25 years worth of Supreme Court
decisions do protect pure expressions of opinion, which cannot be
proved true or false.
   Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall dissented from
today's ruling, but only because they would have interpreted the
comments in Diadiun's 1975 column as opinion.
   Rehnquist wrote: ``The dispositive question ... is whether or
not a reasonable factfinder could conclude that the statements in
the Diadiun column imply an assertion that ... Milkovich perjured
himself. We think this question must be answered in the
affirmative.''
   Milkovich was coaching Maple Heights High School's wrestling
team at a 1974 home meet against Mentor High School when a melee
involving both teams and spectators erupted. Several wrestlers were
hospitalized.
   Diadiun, who was at the meet, wrote several articles criticizing
Milkovich's conduct.
   In a Jan. 8, 1975, column, Diadiun accused the coach and H. Don
Scott, then superintendent of Maple Heights public schools, of
lying to a judge who had overturned disciplinary measures against
the Maple Heights team.
   During extensive litigation, Milkovich won two preliminary
rounds before the Ohio Supreme Court, and both victories were left
intact by the nation's highest court.
   In a 1984 decision, the Ohio court ruled that Diadiun's
statements about Milkovich were reported as facts, not opinion.
   But in ruling on Scott's related libel suit two years later, the
Ohio Supreme Court reversed its 1984 ruling _ and said Diadiun's
statements were expressions of his opinion.
   In an unusual move, the Ohio court used its Aug. 6, 1986,
decision in Scott's case to doom as well Milkovich's suit against
the paper and Diadiun.
   The case is Milkovich vs. Lorain Journal Co., 89-645.

   A swarm of mild earthquakes struck
southeastern California near the Salton Sea early today, but police
said the temblors were barely noticed and there were no injuries
and no damage.
   ``We are used to the nice hard ones. We didn't even feel it. We
only got a couple of calls by people wondering if there was an
earthquake,'' said Shawn David, a dispatcher at the Brawley Police
Department.
   The swarm included six quakes of magnitude 3 or greater on the
Richter scale between 3:46 a.m. and 4:36 a.m., said Hall Daily,
spokesman for seismologists at the California Institute of
Technology in Pasadena. The biggest quake was magnitude 4.2.
   The epicenter was 12 miles west-northwest of Brawley near the
south end of the Salton Sea, about 100 miles east of San Diego.

<HEAD>Court Expands Police Search Powers in Chicago Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today expanded police powers
by letting them search a home when they are let in by someone they
mistakenly believe has authority to consent to a warrantless search.
   In a 6-3 ruling in a case from Chicago, the justices said
evidence from such searches may be used in court as long as police,
at the time of the entry, reasonably believe the person who granted
them access shared authority over the premises with the owner.
   The court revived a prosecution of Edward Rodriguez, who was
arrested on July 26, 1985, on charges he possessed cocaine and
marijuana with intent to distribute the drugs.
   Police said they found drugs and drug paraphernalia in plain
view after Rodriguez's girlfriend let them into his apartment.
   Gale Fisher, who for a time shared the apartment with Rodriguez,
summoned police to her mother's home and told them Rodriguez beat
her at the couple's apartment. She said she wanted to file a
complaint.
   The police then accompanied her to Rodriguez's apartment and she
opened the door with a key. She later testified that she took the
key from Rodriguez's dresser after the two argued earlier on the
day of his arrest.
   An Illionis appeals court said police violated the defendant's
rights because Ms. Fisher lacked authority to let the police into
the apartment.
   The appeals court noted that Ms. Fisher's name was not on the
apartment lease and she did not help pay the rent. She also was not
supposed to have access to the apartment when Rodriguez was not
there, the state court said.
   But Justice Antonin Scalia, writing today for the Supreme Court,
said police were entitled to seize the evidence unless they knew
Ms. Fisher did not have authority to let them in.
   ``What we hold today does not suggest that law enforcement
officers may always accept a person's invitation to enter
premises,'' Scalia said. ``Determination of consent to enter must
be judged against an objective standard: would the facts available
to the officer ... warrant a man of reasonable caution in the
belief that the consenting party had authority over the premises?''
   The case now goes back to Illinois courts to determine whether
police reasonably believed Ms. Fischer had authority to let them in.
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice Thurgood Marshall said the
ruling ``ignores the legitimate expectations of privacy on which
individuals are entitled to rely. The majority has taken away some
of the liberty that the (Constitution) was designed to protect.''
   He was joined by Justices Wlliam J. Brennan and John Paul
Stevens.
   The case is Illinois vs. Rodriguez, 88-2018.

   A judge today delayed for at least 24
hours the execution of a woman dubbed the ``Black Widow'' for
killing her husband and trying to kill other men in her life.
   U.S. District Judge Patricia C. Fawsett in Orlando temporarily
blocked today's scheduled 12:01 p.m. electrocution of Judi Buenoano
at Florida State Prison near Starke.
   The case went to federal court when a split state Supreme Court
rejected defense arguments Wednesday that Florida's electric chair
has a defect.
   The judge issued the temporary delay and scheduled a hearing for
today to review the workings of the electric chair, said Richard
Doran, director of criminal appeals in the state attorney general's
office.
   The 24-hour postponement would begin after the hearing, unless
the judge grants the appeal and extends the execution delay.
   Ms. Buenoano, 47, could become the first women executed in
Florida's electric chair since it came into use in 1924, and the
23rd person put to death in the state since the U.S. Supreme Court
lifted its ban on capital punishment in 1976.
   Only one woman has been executed in the United States since the
U.S. Supreme Court ruling. North Carolina executed Velma Barfield
by injection in 1984 for poisoning her boyfriend.
   Prosecutors nicknamed Ms. Buenoano the Black Widow because of
her record of trying, in most cases successfully, to poison, blow
up or drown the men in her life. She was condemened for the 1971
fatal poisoning of her husband.
   Her latest state appeal was based on the botched execution in
Florida of Jesse Tafero. Flames and smoke shot out from under
Tafero's hood May 4, and witnesses said he seemed to breathe and
move after two of the three jolts he was given.
   Defense attorneys allege Tafero was burned alive and that Ms.
Buenoano would suffer the same fate because a faulty electrode has
not been fixed.
   Such a fate, they argue, would violate the Constitution's ban on
cruel and unusual punishment.
   ``We are fully confident that we know what went wrong in the
last execution and it's been fixed,'' said Jon Peck, a spokesman
for Gov. Bob Martinez.
   The Department of Corrections concluded the problem with
Tafero's execution was the use of a synthetic sponge under the
headpiece instead of the usual natural sponge. Tafero did not
suffer because of it, and the sponge was replaced, the department
said.
   In Wednesday's 4-3 ruling, Florida's high court said the matter
was one for the executive branch of government and that the court
must presume the Corrections Department would carry out its duties
properly.
   ``One malfunction is not sufficient to justify a judicial
inquiry into the Department of Corrections' competence,'' the court
said.
   In a dissent, Justice Gerald Kogan said he found it difficult to
believe the sponge was the main problem. He warned of a ``ghastly
possibility.''
   In another dissent, Justice Rosemary Barkett said, ``To my
knowledge this is the first time any court has ever held that it is
the executive branch that decides, without question or appeal, a
constitutional claim of cruel or unusual punishment.''
   Ms. Buenoano was condemned for murdering her husband, Air Force
Sgt. James E. Goodyear. His body was exhumed a decade later after a
car bombing injured Ms. Buenoano's boyfriend.
   She was also convicted of killing her 19-year-old paralyzed son
by pushing him from a canoe in 1980.
   She was convicted of attempted murder in the car bombing and is
suspected of using arsenic to kill a common-law husband in Colorado
in 1977.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today upheld a convicted
Louisiana murderer's death sentence, refusing to let him argue that
jurors were misled about their role in the life-or-death decision.
   By a 5-4 vote, the court said death row inmate Robert Sawyer
cannot benefit from its 1985 decision baring death sentences when
sentencing jurors are told things that minimize their
responsibility in choosing between life or death.
   Sawyer, whose initial round of appeals were completed before
that 1985 decision was announced, had tried to raise the
misled-jury argument in federal court.
   Led by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the court today relied on a
1989 ruling in which it said a ``new rule'' of constitutional law
cannot be applied retroactively to cases where initial rounds of
appeals have been exhausted.
   Kennedy said the court's 1985 decision on misled juries
announced such a ``new rule.''
   ``Because (Sawyer) seeks the benefit of a new rule ... his claim
for habeas corpus relief is without merit,'' Kennedy said.
   He was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices
Byron R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia.
   Justices Thurgood Marshall, William J. Brennan, Harry A.
Blackmun and John Paul Stevens dissented.
   Writing for the four, Marshall said, ``The jury that sentenced
Sawyer to death was deliberately misled about the significance of
its verdict. That Sawyer was thus denied a fundamentally fair trial
was as apparent when Sawyer's conviction became final as it is
today.''
   Marshall added: ``The court's refusal to allow a federal habeas
court to correct this error is yet another indication that the
court is less concerned with safeguarding constitutional rights
that with speeding defendants, deserving or not, to the
executioner.''
   Sawyer was convicted of a murder committed in New Orleans 12
years ago.
   He and Charles Lane beat Fran Arwood, scalded her with boiling
water and set her afire after dousing her with lighter fluid.
   Lane pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison.
   Sawyer refused to plead, stood trial and was convicted in 1981.
   In closing arguments of Sawyer's sentencing trial, a prosecutor
told jurors that their recommendation of life or death as
punishment would be reviewed by several courts.
   But the judge's instructions to jurors made clear that they had
the direct responsibility to determine life or death.
   The case is Sawyer vs. Smith, 89-5809.

   The Supreme Court dealt a devastating blow to
political patronage today, ruling that government employers
generally may not base hiring, transfer and promotion decisions on
someone's party affiliation.
   By a 5-4 vote, the justices said refusing to hire, transfer or
promote people for politically partisan reasons in most cases
violates their constitutionally protected freedoms of speech and
association.
   The court said partisanship may play a role in such employment
decisions only when political affiliation is an appropriate
requirement for carrying out a job, such as a high-level policy
adviser.
   ``Unless these patronage practices are narrowly tailored to
further vital government interests, we must conclude that they
impermissibly encroach on First Amendment freedoms,'' Justice
William J. Brennan wrote for the court.
   The decision reinstates a lawsuit by three Illinois residents
against Gov. James Thompson and Republican leaders in the state.
Its sweeping prohibitions apply as well to federal and local
government employers.
   In a landmark 1976 ruling and a 1980 sequel, the high court
significantly weakened the political patronage system, sometimes
called the ``spoils system.''
   The rulings prohibited government employers from firing anyone _
even some policy-making and confidential government workers _
solely because of their political party unless party loyalty is a
requirement for effective performance.
   But those decisions dealt only with firings.
   Before today, the court never had said partisanship can play no
role in hiring, transfers and promotions as well.
   The court also struck down patronage powers of government
employers in laying off and rehiring public employees.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Expanded police powers by allowing them to search a home when
they are let in by someone they mistakenly believe has authority to
consent to a warrantless search.
   In a 6-3 ruling in a case from Chicago, the justices said
evidence from such searches may be used in court as long as police,
at the time of the entry, reasonably believe the person who granted
them access shared authority over the premises with the owner.
   _ Reinstated a former wrestling coach's lawsuit against an Ohio
newspaper, ruling that allegedly libelous statements in the case
can be treated as assertions of fact, not merely opinion.
   But the 7-2 ruling did not appear to reduce significantly the
free-speech protections from libel law that opinion traditionally
has been given by the nation's courts.
   For the first time, the court said the Constitution's First
Amendment does not require a special, separate privilege for stated
opinions. The decision makes clear, however, that the fact-opinion
distinction will remain important in libel cases, and courts may
continue to throw out lawsuits that seek damages for someone's
stated opinions.
   _ Generally barred states and energy consumers from bringing
federal antitrust suits against energys producers accused of
conspiring to fix prices.
   In a 5-4 ruling, the justices said only direct purchasers of
energy _ in this case utility companies _ may file such suits.
   A federal appeals court had upheld the Illinois patronage policy
in hiring, transfers and promotions but banned such considerations
in layoffs and rehirings. It said layoffs are too similar to
firings.
   Brennan said employee loyalty to government policies can be
ensured without widespread patronage.
   ``A government's interest in securing employees who will loyally
implement its policies can be adequately served by choosing or
dismissing certain high-level employees on the basis of their
political views,'' he said.
   Brennan was joined by Justices Byron R. White, Thurgood
Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia,
Anthony M. Kennedy and Sandra Day O'Connor dissented.
   In a dissenting opinion, Scalia wrote, ``Today, the court makes
its constitutional civil-service reform absolute, extending to all
decisions regarding government employment.''
   In the Illinois patronage case, two men and a woman who said
their job status suffered because they did not vote in Republican
primaries or give money to the party sued the governor, the state
GOP and the heads of several state agencies.
   Cynthia Rutan said she repeatedly was denied promotions to
supervisory positions in the state Rehabilitative Services
Department because she did not support Republican candidates.
   Franklin Taylor, an equipment operator, said he was denied an
Illinois Transportation Department transfer to another county
because party officials opposed it.
   James Moore said the state Corrections Department has refused to
hire him since 1978 because he could not get the backing of key GOP
leaders.
   The three sued for more than $1 billion in damages. Their suit
also seeks to shift control of the state employment system to a
court-appointed federal receiver.
   During oral arguments before the justices last January, their
lawyer, Mary Lee Leahy of Springfield, Ill., said Thompson's office
has controlled all new hires since 1980. In all, 62,000 civil
service jobs are under the governor's jurisdiction.
   She previously had submitted to the court a form used to screen
state employees who seek a promotion and live in Sangamon County.
   The form asks employees to declare how they, or in some cases
their parents, voted in primary elections. It also asks whether the
person would be willing to work for Republicans during an election.
   Lawyers for Thompson and state GOP leaders argued that hiring
political allies stimulates good government because the employee is
likely to appreciate the job and, in turn, serve the public well.
   Today's decision means all the lawsuits remain alive.
   Several groups from the state, including Independent Voters of
Illinois and Common Cause-Illinois, argued in a
``friend-of-the-court'' brief, ``A politically conditioned
employment system inhibits the free functioning of democracy,
rather than advancing it, since it seeks to assist only a single
favored political party and to dissuade all other political
activity.''
   In a similar brief, lawyers for the AFL-CIO said, ``Allocating
governmental resources purely in the interest of partisan politics
grants the favored party an advantage that threatens the legitimacy
of our governmental structure.''
   Lawyers for the commonwealth of Puerto Rico, however, urged the
justices to uphold the Illinois system.
   ``The prospect of employment is a significant incentive to
political effort (and) opportunities to implement the
administration's democratic mandate are enhanced significantly by
patronage hiring,'' the Puerto Rico lawyers contended.
   ``These are compelling state interests which outweigh the
possible First Amendment impairment resulting from patronage
hiring.''
   No other state filed a brief in support of the Illinois system.
   The cases are Rutan vs. Illinois Republican Party, 88-1872, and
Frech vs. Rutan, 88-2074.

<HEAD>Court Says Non-Profit Club May Not Write Off Losses From Food
Sales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Non-profit social clubs may not gain a federal
tax advantage by deliberately incurring losses from selling food
and drink to non-members, the Supreme Court ruled today.
   The court ruled unanimously that the Portland Golf Club in
Oregon may not use such losses to offset investment profits.
   The Internal Revenue Service had said a decision in its favor
would mean a federal revenue gain of at least $4 million nationwide.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun, writing for the court, said clubs may
use losses incurred in sales to non-members to offset investment
income only if the sales were motivated by an intent to make a
profit. The Portland club failed to show it tried to make a profit,
he said.
   The club is exempt from paying federal income tax on dues and
other fees paid by its members. It qualifies for the exemption as a
social club ``organized for pleasure, recreation and other
non-profitable purposes.''
   The club also receives income from selling food and drink to
non-members and in interest from its investments. That income is
not exempt from federal taxation.
   The IRS said the club owed $5,298 in taxes for 1980 and 1981.
   The club said it lost $98,041 those two years from selling food
and drink to non-members because its expenses and overhead for that
activity exceeded income from the sales.
   The club sought to use the losses to offset profits from its
investments.
   The case is Portland Golf Club vs. Commissioner of Internal
Revenue, 89-530.

<TEXT>
   The city council is investigating reports of
death threats allegedly made by security forces against one of
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's harshest critics.
   In the latest report of government intimidation of opponents,
Jorge Castaneda, a writer and opposition leader, said his secretary
was stopped in her car Friday and Monday and told her employer
would be killed if he continued his activities.
   The governing Institutitional Revolutionary Party issued a
statement calling the threats against Castaneda ``repugnant'' and
saying the case would be a good test for the new Human Rights
Commission, news reports said today.
   Salinas also condemned the attempt to intimidate one of his
staunchest critics, saying in a letter Sunday to the liberal
newspaper La Jornada that there would be no impunity for those who
threatened freedom of thought.
   The U.S.-based Committee for the Protection of Journalists said
Wednesday it was ``profoundly worried by the threats and attacks''
against Castaneda and his secretary, Mariana Rodriguez Villegas.
   Similar death threats were received by a state human rights
commission head, Norma Corona, before her mysterious killing on May
21. The killing led to the formation of a new federal human rights
commission.
   In a recent report, the New York-based Americas Watch said
violent human rights abuses have become institutionalized in Mexico.
   ``This pattern of excessive violence and abuse can only mean
that either the Mexican government has adopted a policy of
tolerating such behavior, or it has lost control over its police,
security and prosecutorial agencies,'' the report said. It cited
several cases in which journalists were intimidated, kidnapped or
murdered.
   Salinas' administration has pledged to end corruption and
strong-arm tactics by his party, which has governed Mexico since
its founding 61 years ago.
   The official government newspaper, El Nacional, has suggested
that the threats were imagined, an assertion that has been roundly
criticized by human rights groups, other opposition figures and
politicians.
   ``We demand not just words from the federal government, but
actions that will put an end to this kind of thing,'' Mexico City
councilman Ruben Venadero Valenzuela said Wednesday.
   Ms. Rodriguez said a man stopped her Monday, pulled her from her
car by the hair and said, ``Something bad will happen to you if you
don't stop going to the prosecutor.''
   The Committee for the Protection of Journalists said in its
release that the assault, the second on Ms. Rodriguez, came hours
after she identified one of the people in the first incident as a
former official of the federal police.
   The committee, based in New York, monitors conditions for
journalists worldwide.
   Castaneda, who has written for Newsweek, the Los Angeles Times
and the critical Mexican magazine Process, is a supporter of
opposition party leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas. Cardenas ran a strong
second in the 1988 presidential election and alleged that only
widespread vote rigging gave Salinas the triumph.
   Ms. Corona, a 37-year-old lawyer in Culiacan, capital of the
northern state of Sinaloa, had publicly accused the federal
attorney general's office of stalling the investigation of the
February killings of four of her clients.
   As president of the private Sinaloa State Human Rights
Commission, Ms. Corona had successfully lobbied for recent state
legislation sending any police officer convicted of torture to
prison for 10 years.
   She was gunned down on a Culiacan street.
   Shortly before her death, she told reporters, ``I'm afraid. I
think something bad is going to happen to me. The Federal Judicial
Police are after me. If something happens to me the Federal
Judicial Police will be responsible,'' according to news reports.

<TEXT>
   Former Gov. Arch A. Moore Jr. wants to
back out of a deal with prosecutors and withdraw his guilty plea to
political corruption, according to news reports.
   Moore pleaded guilty May 8 to extortion, mail fraud, tax fraud
and obstruction of justice for illegal acts that took place during
his 1984 campaign, his 1985-89 term and his failed 1988 re-election
campaign.
   But Moore wants to change his pleas, which were part of a
plea-bargain deal with the U.S. Attorney's office, The
Herald-Dispatch of Huntington and WSAZ-TV reported Wednesday,
citing unidentified sources.
   Moore's attorney, William Hundley of Washington, D.C., plans to
send a letter to U.S. District Judge Walter E. Hoffman indicating
Moore's change of heart, the newspaper and TV station reported.
   Neither the judge nor prosecutors would comment on the reports.
Moore and Hundley did not return telephone messages left by The
Associated Press.
   Moore's wife, Shelley, said he was not at home today and refused
to answer any questions about the reports.
   Hoffman's clerk said he had not received a letter from Hundley
and said any such letter likely would be filed with the U.S.
District Court clerk in Charleston, WSAZ-TV reported.
   Clerk Ronald Lawson in Charleston said today the court had not
yet received any such letter.
   Moore, 68, admitted extorting more than $500,000 from coal
operator H. Paul Kizer while he was in office in return for a $2.3
million refund from the state's Black Lung Fund, which provides
benefits to coal miners.
   He also admitted trying to block a federal grand jury
investigation into corruption in his administration.
   Under the deal with U.S. prosecutors, Moore agreed to cooperate
with federal investigators looking into political corruption in
West Virginia. He is scheduled to be sentenced July 10 and faces up
to 36 years in prison and $1.2 million in fines.
   A federal investigation has resulted in more than 10 convictions
of former state officials and lobbyists.
   Moore was governor from 1969 to 1977. He was elected again in
1984 but was defeated in 1988.
   Defendants who have pleaded guilty can seek to change their plea
by petitioning the court before they are sentenced, according to
federal officials and attorneys.

<HEAD>Court Says Texas Man Legally Sentenced to Life</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today reinstated a Texas
man's life sentence in the sexual assault of a young woman.
   The court unanimously overturned a federal appeals court ruling
that said the defendant, Carroll Youngblood, is entitled to a new
trial.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that
Youngblood must be retried because his life sentence was combined
improperly with a $10,000 fine.
   The appeals court said that at the time of his conviction Texas
law did not allow sentences that included both prison terms and
fines.
   But Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, in his opinion for the
high court, said Youngblood's rights were not violated.
   Youngblood was not punished for an act that was legal at the
time it was committed, nor was his punishment increased by a law
enacted after the commission of a crime, said Rehnquist.
   The Texas legislature, acting after Youngblood's conviction but
before his federal court appeal was resolved, revised state law to
allow appeals courts to change unauthorized sentences by removing
fines. No retrial is required under the state law.
   Youngblood was convicted of abducting a 20-year-old woman from
her home and forcing her to drive to a secluded area where he
sexually assaulted her.
   According to court documents, a previous conviction was taken
into consideration when Youngblood was sentenced to life.
   The case is Lynaugh vs. Youngblood, 89-742.

<HEAD>Court Says Texas Man Legally Sentenced to Life</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today reinstated a Texas
man's life sentence in the sexual assault of a young woman.
   The court unanimously overturned a federal appeals court ruling
that said the defendant, Carroll Youngblood, is entitled to a new
trial.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that
Youngblood must be retried because his life sentence was combined
improperly with a $10,000 fine.
   The appeals court said that at the time of his conviction Texas
law did not allow sentences that included both prison terms and
fines.
   But Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, in his opinion for the
high court, said Youngblood's rights were not violated.
   Youngblood was not punished for an act that was legal at the
time it was committed, nor was his punishment increased by a law
enacted after the commission of a crime, said Rehnquist.
   The Texas legislature, acting after Youngblood's conviction but
before his federal court appeal was resolved, revised state law to
allow appeals courts to change unauthorized sentences by removing
fines. No retrial is required under the state law.
   Youngblood was convicted of abducting a 20-year-old woman from
her home and forcing her to drive to a secluded area where he
sexually assaulted her.
   According to court documents, a previous conviction was taken
into consideration when Youngblood was sentenced to life.
   The case is Lynaugh vs. Youngblood, 89-742.

   Nelson Mandela took his message of hope and
unyielding struggle to American church leaders today, thanking them
for their work against apartheid and proclaiming ``our destination
is in sight.''
   ``You are our comrades in arms, you are our brothers and
sisters. We feel perfectly at home with you,'' Mandela said today
at Riverside Church on the second day of a three-day visit to New
York City.
   His address to the 150 church leaders was followed by an
ecumenical service. His schedule today included private meetings, a
television taping, a rally in Harlem and a fund-raising concert
tonight at Yankee Stadium.
   ``I have spent a great deal of my time in prison writing to the
heads of the religious organizations in all countries because of
the key role which they are playing in the struggle,'' Mandela said.
   The 71-year-old deputy president of the once-banned African
National Congress was presented $200,000 for the ANC. During the
ecumenical service, Mandela repeated his call for economic
sanctions against South Africa.
   ``We are now closer to this goal than at any time in our
history. In the words of the prophet Isaiah, we have risen up on
the wings of eagles,'' Mandela said. ``We have run, and not grown
weary ... and finally our destination is in sight.''
   Mandela's 12-day U.S. tour is part of a 13-nation trip to urge
the world to keep up pressure against his homeland until all traces
of apartheid, South Africa's system of racial segregation, are gone.
   ``Apartheid is doomed. South Africa shall be free. The struggle
continues,'' Mandela said Wednesday after he arrived in New York to
an outpouring of love and a hero's ticker-tape parade up Broadway.
   The second day of his first U.S. visit started with a stroll in
a riverside park adjacent to the mayor's residence that got his
security team hopping.
   ``It was very nice,'' he said afterward. ``Thank you. I'm sorry.
I didn't think it would be so much trouble.''
   More than 800,000 people Wednesday lined the streets of Queens,
Brooklyn and lower Manhattan to catch a glimpse of the man who
spent 27 years as a political prisoner in his homeland before his
release four months ago.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo was among the officials who feted Mandela.
   ``I've seen people crying and shouting, but never anything like
this,'' Cuomo said. ``It was the single most memorable thing I've
ever witnessed.''
   Joan Celestine of Brooklyn was one of the thousands who waited
for hours to hear Mandela speak at City Hall.
   ``He represents for each and every one of us the struggle that
we all endure in our lifetime,'' she said. ``He is a symbol of hope
and inspiration for all people.''
   Mandela arrived from Canada nearly two hours late after tour
organizers decided he needed extra rest. Meetings planned for
Wednesday evening with South African exiles and African reporters
and a breakfast today with the Rev. Jesse Jackson were canceled
because Mandela was tired, officials said.
   Organizers said the eight-city U.S. tour may be pared because of
Mandela's health. He had a benign cyst removed from his bladder
less than three weeks ago.
   Mandela was met at Kennedy Airport by a host of dignitaries,
including Cuomo, New Jersey Gov. Jim Florio, New York Mayor David
Dinkins and Jackson.
   Dinkins, the city's first black mayor, gave the man he has
called his hero a bear hug and promised:
   ``One day in this lifetime we will reach freedom's gate together
and ... pass through to a land where we all will be judged by our
fellow beings for the content of our character rather than the
color of our skin.''
   President Bush, scheduled to meet with Mandela next week,
reiterated Wednesday that the United States will not lift its
sanctions until South Africa meets certain requirements, including
the release of all political prisoners.
   Mandela visited a Brooklyn high school, where he briefly spoke
to some 10,000 students and residents who packed the athletic field.
   ``If in our struggle we receive the support of the youth of the
world, then our cause can never fail, can never be lost,'' Mandela
said.
   He gazed for several moments at the Statue of Liberty before
boarding a specially designed ``Mandelamobile,'' a flatbed truck
outfitted with a bulletproof glass bubble, for the ticker-tape
parade to City Hall.
   At City Hall, Mandela's wife, Winnie, aroused the crowd when she
said, ``You too will never be free until we are free in South
Africa.'' She then led in chanting ``Amandla! Amandla!,'' which
means ``power'' in Zulu.
   Mandela was released from prison Feb. 11 after serving 27 years
for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government. During that
time, his name became a rallying cry around the world for black
equality.
   Mandela is staying at the mayor's official residence. He was to
meet with business leaders and address the U.N. General Assembly on
Friday.
   He leaves Saturday for Boston. Also on his itinerary are
Washington, Atlanta, Miami, Detroit, Los Angeles and Oakland,
Calif. He leaves the United States on July 1.

   Several members of
Parliament could be put in an awkward position if action is taken
on a recommendation that polygamy be outlawed.
   Polygamy is traditional in many parts of the country, and
several politicians have more than one wife. But according to a
report by the Task Force on Family Law Reform, polygamy is not
permitted under the constitution, which stipulates equal rights for
women. The task force said this week the practice should be banned.
   The alternative is polyandry _ allowing women to have more than
one husband _ but this is not practical because the constitution
also stipulates that Papua New Guinea is a Christian country, the
report said.
   ``Therefore, it is best for everyone to have only one wife or
one husband,'' it concluded.
   The task force said it was considering recommending that the Law
Reform Commission ask Parliament to abolish polygamy within two
years, athough existing polygamous marriages should continue to be
recognized.

<TEXT>
   Three bombs exploded in the Athens suburb
of Kefalari on Thursday, causing damage but no injuries, police
said.
   A spokesman at police headquarters said the bombs blew up at
three locations in Kefalari at 5:15 p.m. They appeared to have been
placed under parked cars, which they destroyed, he said, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
   Bomb blasts have become an almost weekly occurrence in Athens
over the last month. No one has been seriously injured. The extreme
leftist organization November 17 has claimed responsibility for a
few of the explosions.
   In the most recent incident, November 17 attacked the local
offices of Procter &amp; Gamble, a U.S.-based multinational
manufacturer of household products.
   On May 15, the guerrilla organization set off incendiary devices
in the wealthy suburb of Ekali near Kefalari, calling them the
first salvo in a war against tax evaders.
   November 17 has claimed the killings of 14 people since 1975.
None of the group's members has been arrested.

<TEXT>
   Levin Kipnis, one of Israel's most prominent
and prolific writers of children's literature, has died at age 96.
   Kipnis, who was born in the Ukrainian city of Ushomir in 1894,
died Wednesday in Tel Aviv, Israel radio said.
   Kipnis arrived here in 1913 and studied at the Bezalel School of
Arts, later joning the staff of the Levinsky Teacher's Seminary in
Tel Aviv.
   He edited journals for kindergarten teachers and was one of the
first chidren's writers in the pre-state Jewish community. His
numerous collections in Hebrew encompass some 800 stories and 600
poems.
   Kipnis also wrote chidren's books in Yiddish, publishing a
collection in 1961. Kipnis was awarded the prestigious Israel Prize
in 1978 for ``devoting his life to the development of children's
literature in Hebrew.''

<TEXT>
   Eliahu Elath, an Israeli diplomat who in 1948
submitted the new Jewish state's request for diplomatic recognition
from the United States, died Thursday in Jerusalem. He was 86.
   A statement by Hebrew University did not give the cause of death.
   Elath was Israel's first ambassador to Washington and submitted
the request to then-President Harry S. Truman. It was quickly
approved, giving a boost to the new state's international standing.
   Born in the Ukraine, Elath immigrated to pre-state Palestine in
1925 and later studied Middle East cultures at the American
University of Beirut in Lebanon.
   While in Lebanon in the 1930s, Elath worked for the Reuters news
agency and was a correspondent for the Davar and Palestine Post
dailies, owned by the Histadrut Labor Federation.
   In 1934, Elath became head of the Jewish Agency Political
Department, a precursor to the Israeli government established after
independence in May 1948.
   He was sent as the agency's envoy to Washington in 1945 and
became the Israeli ambassador with the founding of the state. He
was replaced as Washington ambassador in 1950 by Abba Eban, later
Israel's foreign minister.
   Elath was president of Hebrew Univerisity in Jerusalem from 1962
to 1968. Earlier this month he won an honorary doctorate from the
institution for his work in trying to foster better Jewish-Arab
relations.
   He is survived by his wife, Zahava. A funeral service was
scheduled Friday in Jerusalem.

<HEAD>Oil Pumped Off Mega Borg; Oil Slick Stalls off Texas Coast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GALVESTON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Salvage crews using portable pumps are
transferring millions of gallons of oil from the crippled
supertanker Mega Borg, the Coast Guard said today.
   Oil was being pumped to the tanker Janus, which was hired by the
owners of the Norwegian tanker, said Coast Guard Petty Officer
Marsha Delaney. The transfer could take about 10 days, she said.
   The pump room on the Mega Borg was destroyed by a June 8
explosion and fire that left the vessel crippled some 57 miles off
the coast of Galveston.
   An estimated 34.1 million gallons of Angolan crude oil remained
on the Mega Borg before the transfer began late Wednesday night.
   Meanwhile, an oil slick from the vessel continued to dissipate.
The slick was 30 miles long Wednesday, but it has since crumbled
into a series of patches, Ms. Delaney said. The closest patch was
about 18 miles offshore.
   ``We can't predict landfall,'' Ms. Delaney said. ``There's
really no more leading edge. It's all kind of milling about.''
   Crews had cleaned up parts of the slick, and heat has caused
some of it to evaporate.
   The Mega Borg's owner, K-S Mega Borg II, announced Wednesday an
agreement with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
and the Texas Water Commission to conduct an environmental impact
study of the Gulf of Mexico.
   The voluntary agreement is the first of its kind between state
and federal agencies and a tanker owner.
   The Mega Borg was carrying 38 millions gallons of oil when it
was rocked by the explosion. Two crew members died in the blast and
two are missing and presumed dead. Some 3.9 million gallons of oil
spilled from the ship.

<TEXT>
   Bernard Pivot, France's No. 1 literary ambassador,
says goodbye Friday night to millions of viewers after 15 years as
host of a talk show that turned authors and books into television
stars.
   The rumpled, affable Pivot, who became a national institution as
host of ``Apostrophes,'' transformed books into topics of public
debate and kept even avid TV viewers in contact with the world of
literature.
   An author's appearance on the weekly 90-minute show nearly
guaranteed increased book sales.
   ``Publishers are going to have to use their imagination now,''
said Francois Nourissier of the Academie Goncourt, the prestigious
literary circle that awards France's top book prize each year. For
15 years, he said, Pivot ``did a good part'' of the publishers' job.
   Studies show that ``Apostrophes'' influenced up to one-third of
book-buyers. In 1982, Regis Debray, former counselor to President
Francois Mitterrand, complained that Pivot was becoming a
``dictator of the book market.''
   Pivot, 55, said he was bowing out after 724 shows because he is
tired of reading 10 hours a day. His eyes, his taste and even
authors are wearing out on him, Le Figaro Magazine wrote.
   ``The authors have changed,'' it quoted Pivot as saying. ``They
get on too well .... I try sometimes to spark a fire, but the fire
doesn't take.''
   Pivot first noticed a problem when he began disliking novels,
especially historical novels and, most especially, those about the
Middle Ages and the French Revolution, the magazine wrote.
   A lover of soccer and Beaujolais, Pivot brought books into
France's living rooms, making his literary gathering a ``sporting
event,'' as one publisher put it.
   ``Pivot desanctified books,'' said Francoise Verny, literary
director of the publishing house Flammarion. ``Thanks to him, books
became familiar to everyone.''
   So did Pivot, an elfin faced-man with unkempt hair and
half-specs sliding down his nose who every Friday at 9:30 p.m.
gathered an assortment of authors to discuss, praise or criticize
each other's books.
   Occasionally, Pivot spent his weekly rendezvous with a single
author. He traveled to the Vermont home of Soviet exile Alexander
Solzhenitsyn and the Swiss home of Vladimir Nabokov,
conspiratorially pouring whiskey from a tea pot for his ill-at-ease
guest throughout the 90 minutes.
   ``A little more tea, Mr. Nabokov?''
   ``With pleasure, but I find it a bit strong,'' Nabokov replied.
   Politicians, from former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing to
Soviet radical Boris Yeltsin, also appeared on ``Apostrophes.''
   ``All the books launched on `Apostrophes' were not
masterpieces,'' Le Figaro Magazine quoted Pivot as saying. ``And
all masterpieces were not launched by `Apostrophes.' But since
1975, nothing which has made the life of books and the shock of
ideas escaped `Apostrophes.'''
   The show, which already has inspired a spin-off on a competing
channel, will be replaced by another literary show. Pivot himself
plans to return to the TV public in 1991 with what he calls a
``cultural magazine.''

<HEAD>Ghosts: Divers Discover Henrik Ibsen's Shipwreck</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Divers have discovered the sunken schooner
that inspired playwright Henrik Ibsen to use maritime themes in his
dramas, the national news agency NTB reported Thursday.
   Ibsen's grandfather, also named Henrik, was the captain and
owner of the ship when it sank on its way back to Norway from
England in 1797. All 16 people aboard drowned.
   NTB said diver Kenneth Odegaard located the three-masted ship in
120 feet of water off Grimstad, a southern town where Ibsen did his
first serious writing. The agency said a bell engraved with the
ship's name, Charitas, was brought up several months ago after a
year's search.
   ``The find will have a place in world history because of its
clear influence in the captain's grandson,'' said an Ibsen expert,
Bjoern Hemmer, in a ceremony at Grimstad's Ibsen museum.
   The playwright heard about the shipwreck from his grandmother.
In his works, Ibsen described the sea as compelling and
threatening, and used shipwrecks as symbols of human defeat and
destiny.
   Ibsen, among the most influential precursors of modern theater,
is best known for his late 19th-century plays such as ``Ghosts''
and ``Enemy of the People,'' which centered on rebellion against
social restrictions.

<HEAD>Year's Longest Day Drives Some up the Wall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN ENDERS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The year's longest day for many
residents of northern latitudes consists of midnight barbecues and
3 a.m. softball games. But for some, the total lack of darkness is
no fun at all.
   In much of Alaska and other parts of the north, summer solstice
_ June 21 _ brings 24 hours of daylight and one of the year's most
celebrated times. The clanging of ice-cream trucks can be heard
late into the evening. To the delight of children, bedtime never
seems to come.
   But while most northerners blossom, some just cannot adapt.
   ``It was really bizarre,'' said Paul Korchin, who spent three
years in Nome on the Bering Sea and recently returned to Virginia.
``I found it extremely difficult to get a good night's sleep. Even
the littlest crack of light would bug me.''
   The sun, shining brightly past midnight, ``freaked me out,'' he
said. ``All that light would get on my nerves.''
   Korchin, whose jobs included a stint as a police dispatcher,
said all summer long he felt bedraggled: ``It got so bad I went to
the clinic to get checked out.''
   Eventually, he taped cardboard over his windows so he could
sleep.
   Along the Arctic coast, the sun has been up since May 11, arcing
through the sky. It will set again Aug. 2. Even as far south as
Anchorage, twilight lasts all night, though the sun does set for
about 3{ hours.
   North of the Arctic Circle, in communities along the Arctic
Ocean such as Barrow and Wainwright, residents in summer hunt and
fish, work and play all day.
   ``We just don't sleep. Your body feels like it doesn't need
sleep,'' said Eric Loring, an anthropologist in Anchorage.
   For two years, Loring has studied Native life at Wainwright, a
village more than 700 miles northwest of Anchorage. When he first
arrived there, he went to a whaling camp. Because it never got
dark, he said, he lost all track of time.
   ``When I got back home, I thought it had been just a day or
two,'' he said.
   Five days had passed.
   ``I just could not believe it,'' he said.
   Although Loring has studied northern populations for 13 years,
mostly in Canada, he still expresses amazement at differences in
daily life.
   ``It's flat out. You're up, you're about, hunting caribou,
whatever time it happens to be. There's no clock.''
   He adds: ``Some people do go nuts. ... To me now it's just
normal. And it's kind of weird to sleep in the dark now.''
   Recreation begins after dinner, often as late as 1 a.m. or 2
a.m. Softball and volleyball games are continuous, and children
talk to each other through the night on citizens band radios _ the
primary form of communication in the village.
   But then there's the dark side: In winter, there's no light,
especially above the Arctic Circle.
   And it results in what some call cabin fever, that depression
and frustration that creeps up during long spells of darkness and
bad weather.
   Scientists call it seasonal affective disorder, or SAD, and its
effects can be mild or devastating depending on the sufferer.
   Depression increases significantly among northern populations
during the winter, said Dr. Carla Hellekson, a psychiatrist and
sleep-disorder specialist at the Providence Sleep Disorders Center
of Seattle.
   SAD causes some people to sleep 14 to 16 hours a day, overeat,
become agitated and generally complain of the ``winter blahs,''
Hellekson said.
   That contrasts with what Hellekson calls ``summer energy
syndrome.''
   ``People are on a roll, talking more, shedding weight. ... It's
not a disorder. Don't call it hypermania,'' she says.
   Dr. Ted Mala, who heads the Institute for Circumpolar Health
Studies in Anchorage, says the explanation is partly chemical. The
pineal gland in the brain secretes more endorphins under
full-spectrum light. The result: People feel better in summer.

   Levin Kipnis, one of Israel's most prominent
and prolific writers of children's literature, has died at age 96.
   Kipnis, who was born in the Ukrainian city of Ushomir in 1894,
died Wednesday in Tel Aviv, Israel radio said. Funeral services
were Thursday.
   Kipnis arrived is Israel in 1913 and studied at the Bezalel
School of Arts, later joining the staff of the Levinsky Teacher's
Seminary in Tel Aviv.
   He edited journals for kindergarten teachers and was one of the
first chidren's writers in the pre-state Jewish community. His
numerous collections in Hebrew encompass about 800 stories and 600
poems.
   Kipnis also wrote chidren's books in Yiddish, publishing a
collection in 1961. Kipnis was awarded the prestigious Israel Prize
in 1978 for ``devoting his life to the development of children's

   A West German prosecutor began a criminal
investigation Thursday of East Germany's former Communist leader
and reports that he harbored leftist terrorists sought in the West.
   Erich Honecker has denied the accusations, which increased after
the arrests in East Germany this month of nine reputed members of
the Red Army Faction. The leftist group has been blamed for a
series of bombings and killings in West Germany.
   East German Interior Minister Peter-Michael Diestel alleged this
week that harboring terrorists was the ``personal hobby'' of
Honecker and his secret police chief, Erich Mielke. Both were
ousted in last fall's peaceful revolution.
   In the West German city of Karlsruhe on Thursday, state
prosecutor Gerhard Klass said he had opened an investigation into
Honecker for alleged ``obstruction of justice.''
   ``We suspect that Honecker and his secret police agents hindered
the pursuit of Red Army Faction terrorists sought in arrest
warrants,'' Klass told reporters.
   Klass said the suspicion involves ``providing most-wanted
criminals a place to live, false identity, etc.''
   In a later telephone interview, Klass said the maximum penalty
ranges from a small fine to five years in prison.
   ``This does not involve only Honecker, it includes Mielke, and
all the way down to the ones that knowingly gave them shelter,''
Klass said.
   The Baden-Wuerrtemberg state prosecutor said he has jurisdiction
in the case because the original arrest warrants against the
terrorists were issued in Karlsruhe, which is in the state.
   However, the federal prosecutor's office, which issued the
warrants, has said it does not plan to investigate Honecker.
   Asked if he really expected Honecker or any of the others to be
extradited for trial, Klass responded: ``That we can't even
speculate at this time. We have to see what the investigation turns
up.''
   Klass did not say how long he expected the investigation to take.
   Shortly after Klass' announcement, Honecker's lawyer, Friedrich
Wolff, rejected the allegations.
   On Wednesday, Honecker denied that his ousted government
sheltered terrorists and blamed the charges on a campaign against
the ``good reputation'' of his government.
   Honecker, in a rare public statement, defended what he said was
his Communist government's pursuit of peace and its fight against
terrorism.
   ``Nothing in these accusations corresponds to reality,''
Honecker said in a statement released through the East German
government news agency, ADN.
   All the reputed terrorists arrested had false identities and
some said they had been aided by members of Honecker's secret
police. Some had been fugitives more than a decade.
   The Red Army Faction waged a deadly terrorist war against West
German capitalism and NATO in the 1970s and 1980s. The most recent
victim, Deutsche Bank chief Alfred Herrhausen, was killed in a bomb
attack in November.

   Atlantis' five astronauts on
Thursday successfully completed a test that simulated an engine
start and cut off moments before liftoff, NASA said.
   The shuttle is scheduled for a secret military mission in
mid-July.
   NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone said the two-day drill went
smoothly. The countdown clock was stopped at four seconds before
the mock liftoff.
   On Monday, Atlantis was moved from the hangar to the launch pad
previously occupied by Columbia. Columbia was returned to the
hangar last week for repair of a hydrogen leak that has delayed the
shuttle's astronomy mission until at least mid-August.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration plans to
conduct a special tanking test on Wednesday, partly filling
Atlantis' external tank with super-cold liquid hydrogen to make
sure there are no leaks. A similar test was performed on Columbia a
week after a hydrogen leak was detected during fueling for a May 30
launch.
   A launch date for Atlantis will be set at the conclusion of a
two-day flight readiness review on June 28 and 29.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. aircraft carrier Midway docked
at its home base today after two shipboard explosions killed two
crew members and injured 16 others, nine seriously, officials said.
   ``Midway is safe and seaworthy in all respects,'' Rear Adm. Lyle
Bull, commander of the Battle Force 7th Fleet, told about 100
reporters aboard the 67,000-ton ship a day after the blasts.
   ``The safety of the ship was never in jeopardy,'' Bull said
shortly after the ship moored at the U.S. naval base in Yokosuka,
30 miles southwest of Tokyo.
   The commander stressed there was no danger to the ship's weapons
area from the explosions in a 12-by-12-foot storeroom for
firefighting and other emergency equipment on the fourth deck,
about six decks below the flight deck.
   Aside from the nine seriously injured, who were flown to
hospitals ashore, seven injured crewmen were treated on the ship,
the Navy said.
   Bull said the casualties occurred when a firefighting crew
investigated smoke coming from the storeroom shortly before noon
Wednesday. The first explosion occurred when they opened the hatch
and entered, he said.
   For two of the sailors, ``death most probably was
instantaneous,'' Bull said. They had earlier been listed as missing.
   The Pentagon identified the two dead today as Ulric Patrick
Johnson of Martinez, Calif., and Jeffrey Allan Vierra of Nevada
City, Calif.
   Johnson, 20, was a mess management specialist and had been
inducted into the service in December 1987. Vierra, also 20, was a
fireman and had been inducted into the Navy in September 1988, the
Pentagon said.
   The names of those injured were not released.
   Bull said the room was near a pipe for the ship's catapult
system containing steam at 850 degrees Fahrenheit, and ``water
sprayed on the bulkhead turned to steam, that's how hot it was.''
   But he declined to speculate on the cause of the explosion or
whether it was related to the steam pipe. He said the cause still
was under investigation.
   While Bull acknowledged there was smoke before the explosion, he
said there was no proof a fire occurred. Cmdr. Mark J. Stull,
public affairs officer for U.S. Naval Forces Japan, had said
earlier that a fire in the storeroom had been put out shortly after
midnight Wednesday.
   Bull said the first explosion occurred at about 12:30 p.m.
Wednesday, the second at 1:15 p.m: ``It was confined to a small
area. There was no rocking of the Midway.''
   He said the Midway, scheduled to remain at sea another two
weeks, returned to port early ``to give the crew a rest and to
replenish our fire-fighting equipment. We did not have to come in
but there was no reason to stay out.''
   Outside the base's gate, about 50 anti-nuclear demonstrators
chanted ``Don't let the Midway land here,'' and ``Don't let in
nuclear weapons.''
   Eight wore sashes identifying them as victims of the U.S. atomic
bombings of the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.
   Earlier, about 20 Japanese demonstrators from three citizens
groups and the Greenpeace environmental organization held signs
protesting the U.S. military presence in Japan.
   About 12 protesters tried to enter the base but were blocked by
Japanese police and U.S. Marines. After a few minutes of shoving
and shouting, the police locked arms, pushed the demonstrators back
and locked the metal gate.
   Critics contend U.S. ships have brought nuclear weapons into
Japanese ports despite a Japanese ban against them. As a matter of
policy, the United States refuses to comment on the location of its
nuclear weapons.
   Japan is the only country that has experienced nuclear attacks,
and many Japanese still have misgivings about the presence of
50,000 U.S. troops and armaments.
   City officials had demanded the Midway be barred from returning
until its safety had been confirmed and cause of the incident
clarified.
   The Midway fire was the second serious Navy accident since a
series of incidents last fall that resulted in 14 deaths.
   The Midway, part of the 7th fleet, carries a crew of 4,500 and
62 aircraft and has two steam catapults, used to launch planes from
the flight deck. The 1,000-foot carrier was commissioned in 1945
and is the Navys's oldest in active service, although it has been
extensively modernized.
   The incident occurred as the Midway participated in a joint
exercise 125 miles northeast of Yokosuka with the Japanese Maritime
Self Defense Force. Stull said it was not known whether the
exercise would continue.
   In the last major fire aboard a U.S. warship, a pre-dawn blaze
broke out May 8 on the guided-missile destroyer USS Conyngham
during routine operations in the Atlantic about 100 miles southeast
of Norfolk, Va.
   One crewman was killed and 18 were injured in the fire, which
broke out in the engine room, officials said. The cause is under
investigation.

<HEAD>Belgian Farmers Demonstrate, Surprise Prime Minister In Barber

<TEXT>
   Farmers angry about a price freeze on
their products used tractors to block cities across southern
Belgium on Thursday, and about 150 invaded a barber shop where the
prime minister was getting a haircut.
   More than 1,000 farmers left their farms at sunrise in their
tractors. By mid-morning, they had blocked main roads and access to
at least a dozen cities. Most were prevented from reaching Brussels
and European Community headquarters by police.
   However, 150 farmers on foot managed to slip through police
controls and surprised Prime Minister Wilfried Martens in a barber
shop about three blocks from his Brussels office.
   ``I am the son of a farmer and the eldest of five sons,''
Martens told them, according to the Belgian news agency Belga. ``I
know your work. I lived and worked for a long time on a farm. I
sympathize with you.''
   He was cheered by the farmers who discussed their problems with
him for a few minutes before leaving.
   The farmers complained to Martens that they have to pay more for
what they buy but earn less from selling their produce because of
an EC farm price freeze introduced to reduce the EC farm budget.
   By late morning, 400 tractors from southern Belgium were
reported by Belga to be heading for Brussels. Police stopped 200
tractors in the Brussels' suburb of Waterloo but another 200
blocked traffic in Wavre, southeast of the capital.
   More than 100 invaded Namur and 90 blocked Brussels' main
southeastern express motorway access. The center of Charleroi was
blocked by 70 tractors while others caused traffic jams in Mons,
Tournai, Ath, Huy , Marche and other places.
   In Bastogne, hundreds of farmers besieged the town hall, where
the minister in charge of agriculture for the area was meeting with
other local officials.

   NBC's revamped ``Today'' show had a slight
ratings increase in its first week, but ABC's ``Good Morning
America'' won the morning Nielsen race for the 24th straight week.
   Separately, ABC said that Joan Lunden, the permanent co-host on
``Good Morning America'' since 1980, has signed a five-year
contract to continue on the show. Her salary was not disclosed.
   Lunden joined ``Good Morning America'' in 1976 as a reporter and
temporary co-host.
   ``Good Morning America'' averaged a 4.0 rating last week, easily
beating ``Today,'' which averaged a 3.3, according to A.C. Nielsen
Co. figures released Thursday.
   ABC won despite the wide attention given to last week's return
of former ``Today'' host Joe Garagiola to NBC's show on a
three-day-a-week basis.
   The ratings for the new-look ``Today'' was up two-tenths of a
point from the previous week. The perenially third-place ``CBS This
Morning'' averaged a 2.3 rating. Each ratings point represents
921,000 homes.

   A Senate panel passed a resolution today that
praised President Bush for suspending talks with the Palestine
Liberation Organization and spelled out conditions for resumption
of the dialogue.
   The 13-1 vote in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
reflected the widespread support that Bush has garnered on Capitol
Hill for his action on Wednesday. Only Sen. Gordon Humphrey,
R-N.H., voted against the resolution, which has over 40 co-sponsors.
   The resolution, which now goes to the Senate floor, demands that
PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat expel Abu Abbas from the organization,
renounce all forms of terrorism and recognize Israel's right to
exist. It also commended Bush.
   Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., said the PLO broke the trust that the
United States placed in it by allowing terrorism.
   ``That trust cannot and must not be restored without concrete
actions that irrevocably demonstrate that the PLO has abandoned
terrorism once and for all,'' he said.
   Lawmakers said the next move was Arafat's.
   ``I hope that the PLO will take the steps necessary to allow
resumption of the dialogue based on the commitments undertaken'' by
it in December 1988, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, said Wednesday.
   Bush earlier in the day called a halt to the 18-month-old
dialogue with the PLO because the umbrella group failed to condemn
forcefully enough an aborted terrorist attack in Israel on May 30.
   The attack was thwarted when Israeli defenders intercepted the
guerrillas, killing four and capturing 12. Abu Abbas, a member of
the PLO executive committee, claimed responsibility for the attack.
   Mitchell called Bush's action a ``correct decision'' and others
joined in praise.
   ``The ball is in the PLO's court,'' said Senate Minority Leader
Bob Dole, R-Kan. ``It must unequivocally condemn the recent
terrorist attack. It must discipline those responsible, starting
with Abu Abbas.''
   By suspending talks with the PLO, Bush avoided a possible
confrontation with Congress over proposed legislation that called
for a cutoff of the U.S.-PLO dialogue.
   ``If the president had not suspended the dialogue with the PLO,
that would have been tantamount to giving terrorist elements within
the organization a green light to renew their attacks on
civilians,'' said Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn.
   Today, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed a
resolution commending Bush for his action. The vote was 13-1. The
measure also spells out conditions the PLO must meet if talks are
to resume. Those conditions mirror the ones set out by Bush.
   John Kelly, assistant secretary of state for the Middle East,
said at a House hearing that the decision could spark a wave of
violence in terrorism in the Middle East, possibly undermining
prospects for peace.
   But Lieberman said the ``failure to suspend the talks would
result in more violence, not peace. Acts of terrorism must be met
with a strong response.''
   Rep. Larry Smith, D-Fla., one of Israel's staunchest supporters
in Congress, said he was concerned that Bush might try to
reinstitute the U.S.-PLO dialogue without waiting for substantive
policy changes from the Palestinian group.
   To prevent such as occurrence, Smith proposed legislation to set
strict terms for the PLO to meet before talks resume.
   ``The PLO can't go back to their old ways,'' added Rep. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y.
   Rep. William Broomfield of Michigan, the senior Republican on
the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said Bush's decision was ``the
only one he could have made under the circumstances.''
   ``America must let Arafat know that the PLO can't talk peace and
wage war at the same time,'' Broomfield said. ``President Bush was
wise to suspend rather than terminate the talks. Arafat should know
that the United States is still willing to cooperate in the search
for peace, but not under the barrel of a gun.''

<HEAD>Defense Attys: HUD Defendant Gave Most of Stolen Money to Charity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for the woman dubbed ``Robin HUD'' are
disputing prosecutors' contentions that she gave to charity only
$1.1 million of the more than $6 million she stole from the
Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   Marilyn Louise Harrell, whose sentencing was scheduled Friday,
pleaded guilty in January to stealing government property and
failing to report income for taxes.
   The 46-year-old Temple Hills escrow agent gained the moniker
``Robin HUD'' by federal investigators because she claimed she gave
most of the embezzled money to charities.
   But prosecutors have contended Harrell donated only $1.1 million
to charities and spent most of the rest on herself, her family and
her businesses.
   In documents filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court, Harrell's
attorneys said the amount she spent to help others totaled more
than $5.1 million.
   The papers, however, show the total includes $155,956 that went
to members of Harrell's family, $183,000 for taxes and hundreds of
thousands of dollars poured into numerous businesses to the benefit
of friends, relatives and business associates.
   ``I cannot and will not deny that her family did benefit,'' said
attorney Anthony R. Gallagher, who represents Harrell. ``But
certainly (the bulk of the money) did not go to Marilyn Harrell and
her family.''
   Based on the charitable giving and Harrell's cooperation with
investigators, Gallagher will urge U.S. District Judge Herbert F.
Murray to sentence her to 16 months in prison.
   Federal prosecutors intend to argue for a 46-month term.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Thursday by the Supreme Court.
   
   POLITICAL PATRONAGE
   
   The court dealt a devastating blow to political patronage today,
ruling that government employers generally may not base hiring,
transfer and promotion decisions on someone's party affiliation.
   By a 5-4 vote, the justices said refusing to hire, transfer or
promote people for politically partisan reasons in most cases
violates their constitutionally protected freedoms of speech and
association.
   The court said partisanship may play a role in such employment
decisions only when political affiliation is an appropriate
requirement for carrying out a job, such as a high-level policy
adviser.
   The cases are Rutan vs. Illinois Republican Party, 88-1872, and
Frech vs. Rutan, 88-2074.
   
   POLICE SEARCHES
   
   The court expanded police powers by allowing them to search a
home when they are let in by someone they mistakenly believe has
authority to consent to a warrantless search.
   In a 6-3 ruling in a case from Chicago, the justices said
evidence from such searches may be used in court as long as police,
at the time of the entry, reasonably believe the person who granted
them access shared authority over the premises with the owner.
   The case is Illinois vs. Rodriguez, 88-2018.
   
   LIBEL
   
   The court reinstated a former wrestling coach's lawsuit against
an Ohio newspaper, ruling that allegedly libelous statements in the
case can be treated as assertions of fact, not merely opinion.
   But the 7-2 ruling did not appear to reduce significantly the
free-speech protections from libel law that opinion traditionally
has been given by the nation's courts.
   For the first time, the court said the Constitution's First
Amendment does not require a special, separate privilege for stated
opinions. The decision makes clear, however, that the fact-opinion
distinction will remain important in libel cases, and courts may
continue to throw out lawsuits that seek damages for someone's
stated opinions.
   The case is Milkovich vs. Lorain Journal Co., 89-645.
   
   GAS
   
   The court generally barred states and energy consumers from
bringing federal antitrust suits against energys producers accused
of conspiring to fix prices.
   In a 5-4 ruling, the justices said only direct purchasers of
energy _ in this case utility companies _ may file such suits.
   The case is Kansas vs. Utilicorp United Inc., 88-2109.
   
   SOCIAL CLUBS
   
   Non-profit social clubs may not gain a federal tax advantage by
deliberately incurring losses from selling food and drink to
non-members, the Supreme Court ruled today.
   The court ruled unanimously that the Portland Golf Club in
Oregon may not use such losses to offset investment profits.
   The Internal Revenue Service had said a decision in its favor
would mean a federal revenue gain of at least $4 million nationwide.
   The case is Portland Golf Club vs. Commissioner of Internal
Revenue, 89-530.

   A 165-year-old French Creole style house
being moved to a museum blocked traffic for more than three hours
because it was too wide to clear the railings on an overpass.
   State police Lt. Tim Brunett said traffic Wednesday backed up
about five miles on Louisiana Highway 1, from Port Allen to Brusly,
until workers got the house high enough to clear the railings.
Traffic started moving again about 3:30 p.m.
   The Aillet house was being moved from its original site, north
of Brusly, to the West Baton Rouge Historical Association's museum
in Port Allen, where it will become a permanent exhibit.
   Gerry Daigre, a Dow Chemical U.S.A. spokesman, said the company
donated the house, which is held together by wooden pegs rather
than nails and has cypress weather boards.

   A lightning bolt ignited a reservoir at an oil
station in Siberia on Thursday and started a fire that spread to at
least four of the station's 24 tanks, the Tass news agency reported.
   Tass said 28 fire engines were fighting the fire at the
Karkateyevy station near Nefteyugansk, Tass said. That is in the
Tyumen oil region of Western Siberia.
   The reservoirs at the station contain a total of 380,000 tons of
oil, Tass said.
   ``The danger is still great,'' I. Kimstan, head of the
fire-fighting directorate of the Russian Interior Ministry told
Tass. Strong winds were making it difficult to contain the fire,
which had spread to 22 acres, he said.

   The White House offered humanitarian
assistance to Iran today after a devastating earthquake that the
state media said killed at least 1,900 people and injured nearly
5,000.
   ``We are saddened by the damage and the loss of life,'' White
House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said. He said a message of
condolence had been sent to President Hashemi Rafsanjani.
   `We are also expressing our willingness to provide appropriate
humanitarian assistance should it be requested,'' Fitzwater said.
   The messages was delivered to Iran by another, unidentified
country since the United States does not have diplomatic relations
with Tehran.

   In a setting of boarded-up windows, peeling
plaster and bare cement floors, Housing Secretary Jack Kemp took
part Thursday in groundbreaking ceremonies for renovation of a
once-elegant apartment building into housing for the homeless.
   Kemp said the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which
he heads, was not involved in the project, scheduled to open next
April as Lazarus House, ``but we would like to be.''
   ``Lazarus House represents a remarkable private, nonprofit
partnership committed to creating decent, affordable and drug-free
housing,'' Kemp said.
   The project is intended to provide apartments for about 80
formerly homeless people at a rent of around $240 a month. It is
being undertaken by Samaritan Inns, a nonprofit program designed to
combat the causes of homelessness.
   David Erickson, president of Samaritan Inns, said the building
was erected in 1910 by Harry Wardman, a prominent Washington
builder who was also responsible for the British Embassy. The
building opened as a 56-unit apartment called Hawkins Court.
   Erickson said the building deteriorated in the late 1970s and
the last of the tenants moved into public housing in 1982. Since
then, the building has been vacant. Samaritan Inns purchased it in
1988.
   The organization has raised more than $2 million of the
estimated $3.7 million cost of renovating the 43,000 square-foot
building, Erickson said. He said much of the design and
construction work was being donated.
   Catherine Hammonds, a neighborhood activist who spoke at the
ceremony, said the neighborhood has been plagued in recent years by
drugs, crime and litter.
   ``For years, people told me this building was going to be
renovated,'' she said. ``I would say, `No, it's not going to
happen.' I am indeed glad to see something positive happening.''
   Samaritan Inns, established in 1986, operates three other
transitional residences for homeless men and women in Washington.
Its goal is to help them ``overcome their homelessness and return
to the mainstream of society,'' it said in a statement distributed
at the ceremony.
   The statement said the program ``targets homeless men and women
who are motivated and able'' and the residents ``will be challenged
by a social services staff to participate in programs that help
them become productive and independent members of society.''
   It said the program will be self-supporting.

   Tribal drums and native dances are replacing
the pop tunes and disco gyrations of aerobic workouts in an effort
to get American Indians to exercise the way their ancestors did.
   ``Traditionally, everyone _ young and old _ used to dance all
night during tribal celebrations,'' said Rebecca Thomas, community
health director with Nevada's Indian Health Service.
   ``A lot of these dances and songs are kind of lost,'' Thomas
said Wednesday. ``It's good that we can bring them back.''
   Thomas, of the Duck Valley Indian Reservation in Owyhee, just
south of the Idaho line, spoke as a group of 85 American Indians
bounced and flexed through a workout paced by rhythmic chants and
beating drums.
   The first-of-its-kind routine eventually will be captured on a
40-minute exercise video aimed at older Indians.
   ``This is motivating. You have to look at where people are from
and what's important to them,'' said video coordinator Betty
Dodson, associate director of the Geriatric and Gerontology Center
at the University of Nevada, Reno.
   Violet Hooper, a 39-year-old Shoshone from the remote Yomba
Indian Reservation in southern Nevada, said the program works for
her.
   Before, ``I'd just fall asleep in a chair,'' she said. ``Now,
when I sit down, I don't feel like I can just sit there. I have to
keep moving.''

   Masked Palestinians chanting ``No to America!''
marched through cities of the occupied West Bank on Thursday to
protest the suspension of U.S. talks with the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   In annexed Arab east Jerusalem, stone-throwing Palestinian women
and masked youths clashed with riot police after an Arab was killed
there in an earlier protest over the U.S. decision.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir urged the United States to
permanently end talks with the PLO.
   Shamir, who initially expressed elation, toned down his response
to President Bush's announcement Wednesday that the dialogue would
be suspended. Bush made the decision because the PLO failed to
condemn an attempted raid on Israel on May 30 by a Palestinian
faction.
   ``I hope that the suspension will not be temporary but instead
will open a new chapter in relations between the United States and
the Middle East,'' Shamir said on Israel radio.
   He said Washington's determination to fight terrorism would not
be clear until it cut its dialogue with the PLO permanently.
   Israel objects to any PLO involvement in peace efforts, claiming
the organization is a terrorist group bent on destroying the Jewish
state. Israel has been pushing the United States to end its
dialogue with the PLO since it began in December 1988 after PLO
chief Yasser Arafat renounced terrorism.
   Israeli newspapers and analysts said Bush's action Wednesday
could mean more American pressure on Israel to forge a new peace
strategy.
   Defense Minister Moshe Arens said Israel did not feel pressured
to come up with a reciprocal peace gesture.
   Protests over the U.S. move broke out Thursday in several West
Bank cities.
   In Nablus, the West Bank's largest city, dozens of Palestinians
marched though the crowded market chanting, ``No to America! No to
Israel! Yes to the PLO!''
   At least one of the marchers carried a pistol and others covered
their faces with checkered Palestinian kefiyyeh scarves, one
witness said.
   An anti-American march also was reported in the West Bank town
of Tulkarem.
   In east Jerusalem's Silwan section, 20-year-old Said Mohammed
Fatafta was killed by riot police Wednesday night during a protest
that began after news of the U.S. decision spread. Police said he
was shot when a patrol was attacked by about 25 masked Palestinians
armed with chains, iron bars and stones.
   Palestinian women and masked youths took to the streets Thursday
to protest the death.
   Black flags of mourning and outlawed Palestinian flags fluttered
from rooftops of the hilly Silwan area and nearby Abu Tor. The main
street of Silwan was blocked with boulders and wrecked cars.
   The walls were painted with anti-American slogans such as ``The
Americans are our biggest enemy.''
   ``Mohammed, don't worry, we'll teach the Jews a lesson,'' read
another, with a gun painted next to it.
   A police helicopter hovered overhead and riot police fired tear
gas and rubber bullets to disperse the rioters.
   Three Arabs were treated for rubber bullet injuries and
released, said doctors at east Jerusalem's Mukassed Hospital.
   Fatafta was the 718th Arab killed by Israelis in the
30-month-old revolt against the Israeli occupation. An additional
225 Palestinians have been murdered by other Arabs, most on
suspicion they collaborated with Israel. Forty-five Israelis have
been slain by Palestinians in the violence.

<HEAD>Economic Growth 2nd Slowest in 3{ Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy advanced at its second
slowest pace in 3{ years from January through March, the government
reported Thursday. Analysts said they expect only modest
improvement for the rest of the year.
   But the economists said any future growth would be fueled in
large part by exports after a fall off in consumer spending, which
had been a driving force for the economy through much of the
economic expansion.
   The Commerce Department said the gross national product _ the
nation's total output of goods and services _ grew at a revised 1.9
percent annual rate in the first quarter.
   At the same time, the department revised a price index tied to
the GNP to show an annualized inflation rate of 6.4 percent for the
quarter. The department said half of that increase was due to
rising food and energy prices caused by unusual winter weather and
analysts predicted prices would decline during the remainder of the
year.
   If the GNP and inflation reports are combined with other, more
recent economic indicators, ``the economy is in pretty good shape,
although nobody's talking about a boom,'' said Michael K. Evans of
Evans Economics, Inc., a Washington forecasting firm.
   ``Considering some of the recession forecasts we heard earlier
in the year, that's not at all bad,'' he added. A recession
generally is defined as two consecutive declines in the GNP and has
not occurred since 1981-82.
   Nevertheless, the economy is growing slower than the 3.0 percent
gain of 1989 and the 4.4 percent advance of 1988.
   ``The picture is one of sluggishness,'' said economist Cynthia
Latta of DRI@McGraw-Hill, a Lexington, Mass., forecasting
organization. ``Sluggishness today, and tomorrow, and probably for
several months to come.''
   The first-quarter GNP was up from the 1.1 percent annualized
rate in the final quarter of 1989. that was the slowest advance
since a 0.8 percent gain in the summer of 1986.
   The department said a larger export total than had been reported
was the largest factor in revising the first-quarter GNP from the
meager 1.1 percent gain it had calculated last month. It originally
had projected in April that growth during the period had been 2.1
percent.
   Exports increased 12.8 percent during the period, while imports
grew only 3.0 percent.
   ``Exports are keeping the recovery alive,'' Evans said.
   Consumer spending, meanwhile, was revised from a 2.4 percent
increase reported last month to just 1.6 percent in Thursday's
report.
   ``The lower consumption is consistent with the other news about
consumers,'' said Ms. Latta, noting earlier government reports that
retail sales have declined for three straight months through May,
the first time that has happened since the fall of 1981 during the
last recession.
   Retail sales represent about half of overall consumer spending,
which itself accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's economic
activity.
   The various changes left the GNP, after adjusting for inflation,
totalling $4.193 trillion after the first three months of the year.

   The wood carver who created
Percy the black-ringed New Jersey seagull was no artist, say tax
officials who levied a stiff import duty on the wooden decoy.
   Richmond lumber dealer Clark Robertson received Percy as a gift
from a customer. The customer had carved the bird out of leftover
Alaska yellow cedar that was shipped by Robertson.
   Robertson balked when Revenue Canada said he owes $73.37 in duty
and taxes on the bird.
   After receiving the assessment in early May, he wrote the agency
to protest, saying he'd tried to appraise the bird by comparing it
to other hand-carved gulls but couldn't find one ``that even
remotely resembles Percy.''
   Robertson put the cost of the wood between $5 and $7.25.
   ``Our customer is a hobbyist, who carves for sheer enjoyment. By
the appearance of the decoy, I suspect it may well have been one of
his initial attempts, as it was absolutely lousy,'' he wrote.
   ``As a matter of fact, it is so bad that the only good part of
the whole scenario is that it scared away all those nasty crows
that have been frequenting our back garden.''
   Exactly, replied the government: Original sculptures and
statuary signed by the artist are exempt from duty and taxes, but
``statuettes and other ornaments of wood'' are not.
   ``It appears clear to us in Ottawa that your friend is not a
bona fide artist and as such the proper tariff and duty rates were
charged you,'' wrote Revenue Canada officer Gaston Gingrass.
   Gingrass included some forms for Robertson to appeal the levy,
but when Robertson got all the paper, each of which had six carbon
copies, he said he won't pursue the matter.
   He did offer to ``surrender this apparition to Her Majesty the
Queen'' via Revenue Canada.
   There's been no reply, he said.

<HEAD>Experts See German Unification Harming U.S. Economy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   German unification will drive up U.S. interest
rates and slow economic growth here but the adverse effects will be
offset somewhat by greater demand for American exports, economic
experts told Congress on Thursday.
   The United States will see ``higher interest rates for quite
some time'' because of greater global competition for capital
triggered by efforts to rebuild East Germany and the other Eastern
European nations, said C. Michael Aho, director of economic studies
at the Council on Foreign Relations.
   ``In the near future, the investment-starved economies of
Eastern Europe are likely to begin soaking up funds like a dry
sponge,'' Aho told the Joint Economic Committee. ``In a world of
higher real interest rates, the United States, as the world's
largest debtor nation, borrowing $300 million a day
internationally, would be in a vulnerable position.''
   With the U.S. economy already sluggish, the need to boost U.S.
interest rates to attract foreign capital will mean ``America's
economic woes may be aggravated by having to pay more to balance
its books.''
   Aho cited studies showing a 1 percent rise in world interest
rates would slow U.S. economic growth by 0.4 percent in the first
year and 0.6 percent in the second year _ a significant drop given
the sluggish 1.9 percent U.S. growth rate so far this year.
   But Stephen Cooney, director of international investment for the
National Association of Manufacturers, said higher interest rates
would be partially offset by stronger demand for American exports.
   He said rising demand for American products in Western Europe
has translated into 1 million new jobs in this country since 1985
and the demand should continue, particularly for capital goods such
as computers and heavy machinery needed to overhaul Eastern
Europe's manufacturing sector.
   Aho said dramatic changes in Eastern Europe would also increase
pressure on American lawmakers to boost taxes and cut federal
spending as a way of cutting the federal budget shortfall and thus
reducing America's demand for foreign capital.
   Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International,
said joining East and West Germany wouldn't do that much harm to
other economies because West Germans have strong resources to fund
the unification.
   But Hormats warned that West Germany may have to divert some of
those resources to the Soviet Union to bargain for Kremlin
acceptance of a united Germany in NATO.
   Hormats said the Bonn government may be called on to subsidize
continued East German exports to the Soviet Union, to help with
emergency shipments of consumer goods there and to pay a portion of
the cost of building civilian housing for returning Red Army troops.

<HEAD>Error on Gravestone Puts Veteran on Wrong Side of Civil War</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A new tombstone was supposed to honor
William Lindley Wilcox for his Civil War service with the Union
army, but a government error branding him a Confederate upset some
descendants.
   ``It sure is goofed up. ... He was a Union man and he was
fighting the Confederates. He would have really had a fit,'' said
Wilcox's great-granddaughter, Doris Wilcox-Balmer of Chicago.
   The error on Wilcox's new tombstone was discovered this past
Memorial Day by an ex-soldier who became suspicious about the
Confederate marker while placing flags on veterans' graves at
Prairie View Cemetery.
   Some people bothered by the mistake questioned whether Wilcox's
history would have been altered permanently had the error not been
caught. The government has already agreed to replace the marker.
   ``This is a rather glaring error,'' said state Rep. Leo
Hamilton, whose district includes Hallie. ``A wrong date or wrong
month could occur. The wrong army is not too common.''
   Wilcox, a corporal in Company E of the First Wisconsin Cavalry,
died in 1899. The government issued a flat marble gravestone to
honor his Civil War service.
   Over the years, the tombstone in the tiny northwestern Wisconsin
village of 1,220 people weathered, making it difficult to read. In
1986 the cemetery's caretaker ordered a new one from the
government's monument service, according to Myron Olson, Chippewa
County veterans service officer.
   Erected in 1988, the new marker, made of granite and valued at
$83, contained most of the right facts about Wilcox's life _ born
Feb. 8, 1827, died Oct. 7, 1899, entered the military Nov. 2, 1864,
released July 29, 1865.
   But instead of listing the soldier in the U.S. Army, the
gravestone put him in the Confederate States Army, Olson said.
   While putting flags at veterans graves before Memorial Day,
Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 1038 Commander Jim Gustafson spotted
it, figuring something was wrong about a Wisconsin man fighting for
the Confederate Army.
   His curiosity put officials to work, including a call to
Hamilton who has since contacted U.S. Rep. Dave Obey.
   Ms. Wilcox-Balmer said some of her relatives were quite upset by
the mistake. She said the error wasn't caught by the family because
an aunt who regularly visited the soldier's grave died in early
1988 just before the new marker was installed.
   Olson said he could understand if Wilcox's descendants were
offended.
   ``When you make the kind of sacrifice you do in going to war,
you believe in the side you are fighting on. So, it is pretty grave
to be depicted on the other side,'' he said.
   George Gulas, an administrator for the Monument Service of the
National Cemetery System within the U.S. Department of Veterans
Affairs, called the mistake an ``honest error'' that would not
tarnish Wilcox's contribution to his country.
   The clerk processing the order for the engraver ``probably
didn't put information in the computer right,'' Gulas said in a
telephone interview from Washington, D.C.
   ``There have been a couple of them before. All the clerks aren't
that familiar with the Civil War,'' Gulas said. ``There are a lot
of Confederates buried in northern states. It is not unusual.''

<TEXT>
   Drug policy director William Bennett launched
a pre-emptive strike Thursday on critics who say more U.S. military
aid for battling South American cocaine traffickers could entangle
this country in a Vietnam-like war.
   Increased law enforcement and military assistance for Colombia,
Peru and Bolivia ``is not an American invasion,'' Bennett said in a
speech to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
   ``It is not an escalating military intervention,'' Bennett said.
``But military assistance in all three of the Andean nations is
necessary to achieve a level of security that law enforcement
personnel alone cannot provide.''
   Bennett stressed that U.S. personnel will not participate in
anti-drug operations.
   ``We will not do it for them. They must do it for themselves,''
Bennett said in response to growing expressions of concern by some
lawmakers and others that stepped-up U.S. military assistance could
involve American forces in guerrilla fighting.
   But he conceded there was a danger that more American lives
could be lost. ``This is a dangerous enemy and we cannot expect to
fight this battle unscathed and come out of it unblemished.''
   ``When we sent military trainers or (Drug Enforcement
Administration) agents or State Department personnel to the Andean
region, we expose them to certain risks,'' Bennett said. ``But we
need them there to give the governments a fighting chance and
encourage them to take tough actions of their own.''
   ``If we want to help keep drugs out of America, then we need to
support those countries that are working on the front line against
drugs,'' Bennett said.
   Colombia, Peru and Bolivia are receiving $230 million worth of
aid for anti-drug efforts. The Bush administration has proposed
increasing that to $430 million next year.
   Editorial writers and columnists have questioned whether plans
to send U.S. military advisers to train Latin American forces will
lead to American involvement in a Vietnam-style war, particularly
in Peru where the leftist Shining Path guerrillas control much of
the cocaine-producing areas.
   On Wednesday, Rep. Peter Kostmayer, D-Pa., the acting chairman
of a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee, said he had ``grave doubts
about the militarization of the Andean anti-narcotics effort. ...
   ``Are we getting the United States involved through the back
door in fighting guerrilla wars?'' Kostmayer said.
   Bennett conceded that ``a serious effort'' against drug
traffickers in Peru will inevitably lead to fighting with the
leftist Shining Path guerrillas.
   ``Peruvian authorities know that they cannot fight cocaine at
the source without at the same time providing a measure of security
from Shining Path terror,'' Bennett said.
   Bennett said ``the very mention of military assistance'' causes
``hand-wringing among certain members of the press and Congress''
who ignore the fact that ``the cocaine business is a very dirty and
often deadly business.''
   ``If these efforts are caricatured as another Vietnam, an
American invasion or involvement in a foreign war, then we risk
crippling a series of strengthened relationships that our president
and the president's of the Andean region have recently forged,''
Bennett said.

<HEAD>U.S. Bombings Up 25 Percent in 1989, Drug Bombings Almost Doubled</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of bombings nationwide increased 25
percent last year as drug-related bombings almost doubled, a
government report says.
   ``These are largely bombings related to turf wars or
disagreements within certain factions involved in narcotics
trafficking,'' said Jack Killorin, a spokesman for the Treasury
Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. He was
referring to the leap in drug-related bombings.
   Firearms still are responsible for most drug-related violence,
Killorin acknowledged Wednesday. But he added: ``Nobody at ATF
likes the trend of almost exponential growth in the use of
explosive devices as a weapon in the drug wars.''
   Drug-related bombings last year totaled 64, almost double the 33
in 1988, according to a draft of the ATF explosives incidence
report of 1989. There were only five such attacks in 1987, the
first year ATF counted drug-related bombings.
   In those three years, 18 people have been killed in drug-related
bombings, 13 of them in 1989, the report said. In addition, 56
people have been injured, 17 of them last year.
   ``I don't think there's any question but the street level of
activity in narcotics is becoming increasingly violent,'' Killorin
said.
   Meanwhile, the total number of criminal bomb attacks, for all
reasons, increased by 25 percent, from 1,108 in 1988 to 1,384 last
year. The 1989 total was 59 percent higher than the 871 in 1985.
   Adding in attempted bombings, last year there were 1,699, a 28
percent increase over the 1,332 in 1988. Last year's total was 54
percent higher than the 1,103 in 1985.
   Thirty-three people were killed and 305 injured last year in
bomb attacks. Since 1985, the number of people killed has ranged
between 29 and 43. Last year represented a high for the number of
injured, which had ranged from 182 to 283 in the previous four
years.
   Among motives for bomb attacks, drug issues ranked third, the
report says. Vandalism was first, followed by revenge, then drug
disputes, labor disputes, homicide or suicide, protest, extortion
and insurance fraud. Killorin noted that some bombings had several
motives.
   Bombings listed in the report include explosive as well as
incendiary devices. The difference, said Killorin, ``is the
difference between a hand grenade and a Molotov cocktail.'' The
numbers cover bombings either investigated by the ATF or reported
to the ATF by other law enforcement agencies. They do not include
accidental, non-criminal explosions.
   The report shows that in addition to last year's 64 drug-related
bombings, there were 17 attempted bombings. Total drug-related
bombings and attempts in the past three years were 81 last year, 38
in 1988 and seven in 1987, the statistics show.
   The drug-related attacks include 11 on Detroit's north side that
injured five people and ``appear to be part of a `turf war' between
narcotics trafficking organizations,'' the report says.
   Attempted bombings included a plot by two St. Louis drug dealers
who were angered by the Pike County, Mo., sheriff's strict
enforcement of narcotics laws. They allegedly tried to recruit an
undercover deputy sheriff to help kill his boss.
   ``They decided to blow up the sheriff in his official vehicle to
set an example for other law enforcement officers in the area,''
the report says. The two men face state and federal charges.

   Airlines would have to increase liability

   The protocols to the Warsaw Convention, created in 1929, would
raise to $130,000 the per-passenger limit on liability regardless

   The current limit is $75,000 per passenger, except in cases when
an airline is found guilty of willful misconduct.
   The vote was 11-2, with Sens. Joseph Biden, D-Del., and Paul
Simon, D-Ill., opposing the protocols. The protocols have been
fought by lobbying groups representing trial lawyers. Biden is
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   Despite passage of the protocols, a stiff fight is expected on
the Senate floor where the measures have failed twice before.

   Comedian Steve Martin says he learned early in
his career that an audience pays more attention to the billing than
the performance.
   ``If you're the opening act and you're better than the
headliner, it doesn't matter,'' Martin said in an interview in
July's Gentlemen's Quarterly. ``They're there to see the headliner.
You just don't exist.''
   Relying on billing ``relieves the audience of the necessity of
having to make a decision about you,'' he said.
   Martin said he adopted his trademark white suit when he was
doing stand-up comedy to get noticed so he could climb to the top
of the marquee.
   ``I knew my physical stuff was important and white would just
make it stand out,'' he said.

   Former tennis superstar Bjorn Borg's
elegant seaside home will be seized and sold to the highest bidder
if he doesn't pay more than $1 million within a month, court
officials said Thursday.
   Bailiffs visited Borg's home in a Stockholm suburb Wednesday to
assess its value. ``They were not let in because nobody was home,''
said Bjorn Edgren, a senior court official.
   Borg reportedly was in Italy to watch World Cup soccer action
with his Italian wife, Loredana.
   He was given an extension until July 20 to pay the debt. ``Then
we can use a locksmith,'' Edgren said. The house would then be sold
at auction.
   The $1.1 million debt owed by Borg's former business partner
Lars Skarke was personally guaranteed by the 1970s-era tennis star.
Skarke was managing director of Borg's clothing company that
collapsed last year.
   Borg's lawyer, Henning Sjostrom, said the debt payment was being
arranged from Italy but had been delayed. He said Borg planned
legal action against Skarke aimed at getting the money back.
   The retired tennis great also is negotiating with creditors of
his failed company to pay off million of dollars in outstanding
debts.

   Ectopic pregnancies _ the dangerous development
of fetuses outside the womb _ are increasing ``at epidemic
proportions,'' with 88,000 cases a year, federal health experts
warned Thursday.
   The national Centers for Disease Control said the estimated
88,000 U.S. cases in 1987 _ the latest year for which statistics
are available _ marks a 19 percent increase in one year and more
than a doubling in a decade.
   The CDC report was issued three days after a study in the
Journal of the American Medical Association said women who have had
chlamydia are more than twice as likely as other women to have
ectopic pregnancies. The JAMA study used 1985 statistics.
   Chlamydia and other sexually transmitted diseases can cause
pelvic inflammatory disease in women, which is believed to be the
chief cause of ectopic pregnancies.
   ``If a woman has an infection of the fallopian tubes, they can
become blocked or scarred, and the ovum does not get transferred to
the uterus _ it implants outside the womb,'' said Dr. Hani Atrash,
chief of the Pregnancy and Infant Health Branch at the CDC.
   Pelvic inflammatory disease ``does not explain all the
increases,'' he said, noting other studies implicating factors such
as smoking and stress.
   Ectopic pregnancies have increased about fourfold since 1970,
when national case surveillance began, the CDC said. The 1970 rate
was 4.5 per 1,000 reported pregnancies, compared with 16.8 in 1987.
   ``The increases are of epidemic proportions,'' Atrash said,
adding that the steady, two-decade increase is more than would be
expected simply from better reporting.
   Previous studies have reported that the rates are highest for
women over age 30 and for minority women.
   Ectopic pregnancies killed 30 American women in 1987. While a
relatively small number, they accounted for a tenth of all maternal
deaths in this country, Atrash said.
   If detected early, ectopic pregnancies can be ended surgically,
ending the danger to the mother.

   A 29-year-old man was convicted Thursday of
first-degree murder in the deaths of his four children, who drowned
when the family car sped into the Detroit River last year.
   A Wayne County Circuit Court jury, in its third day of
deliberations, also convicted Lawrence DeLisle of the attempted
murder of his wife, Suzanne. He faces a mandatory life prison term
for the convictions.
   DeLisle, of Lincoln Park, had claimed a leg cramp caused him to
jam his foot down on the accelerator.
   Some residents watched as the family's station wagon, with
DeLisle, his wife and their children sped down a street through a
barrier and flipped into the river.
   Killed were the DeLisles' children, Bryan, 8; Melissa, 4;
Kathryn, 2; and Emily, 8 months. DeLisle and his wife surfaced and
were rescued by boaters.
   Prosecutors were unable to present the jury with evidence of a
purported confession by DeLisle after Judge Robert Colombo ruled
police officers had coerced the suspect.
   Police have said DeLisle told investigators he was in debt and
wanted to end his ``burdens.'' Residents near where the car went
into the river in the Detroit suburb of Wyandotte reported seeing
DeLisle driving in the area before the Aug. 3, 1989, wreck.
   Mrs. DeLisle testified that she and her husband tried to pull
her husband's foot off the accelerator as their car sped toward the
river. She also testified that she had forgotten to tell police
earlier that the couple managed to pull his foot about an inch from
the accelerator, which she said then stuck.
   The car came to rest in 27 feet of water. Mrs. DeLisle said she
and her husband were poor swimmers and were unable to save the
children.
   Defense attorney Frank Eaman accused investigators of ignoring
mechanical defects in the car and DeLisle's history of cramps in
efforts to blame someone for the children's deaths.

Infection</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mormon Church President Ezra Taft Benson
spent a restful night in a hospital and was responding Thursday to
antibiotic treatment for a bacterial infection, a church spokesman
said.
   Benson, 90, was listed in serious but stable condition in the
intensive care unit of LDS Hospital, where he was admitted
Wednesday, said spokesman Don LeFevre.
   ``His attending physician says he is `much better' today, but he
is being carefully observed,'' LeFevre said. ``The doctor would not
speculate as to the length of his hospital stay.''
   The cause and extent of the infection were not immediately
available, he said.
   Benson, who served as U.S. agriculture secretary under
then-President Eisenhower, was named president of the 7.3-million
member Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1985.
   LeFevre said Benson was treated at LDS Hospital May 12 after a
dizzy spell. He had attended the church's 160th Annual General
Conference on April 5-6, but appeared weak and did not address the
conference.
   Benson received a electronic heart pacemaker in 1986 after
episodes in which his heartbeat rhythm slowed.

   The accident occurred on the main road linking the southern

   The Senate, by two votes, today upheld
President Bush's veto of a bill to broaden the political rights of
3 million government workers.
   On a 65-35 vote, lawmakers refused to revise the 51-year-old
Hatch Act to remove prohibitions on campaign activities for federal
and postal employees. A two-thirds majority was needed to enact the
bill into law over Bush's objections.
   The vote gave Bush an unbroken string of 12 victories in veto
showdowns with the Democratic-led Congress.
   At the White House, presidential press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater said, ``We are pleased that that vote was sustained. We
felt that it incorrectly politicized the civil service.''
   The House voted Wednesday to override the veto by a 327-93
margin, well above the two-thirds needed to override Bush's veto of
the bill last Friday.
   The House had originally passed the bill by a vote of 334 to 87.
   The legislation would have allowed federal workers, for the
first time in five decades, to attend political conventions and
caucuses as delegates _ on their own time _ and speak at rallies on
behalf of candidates.
   It also would have removed a ban on government workers holding
offices in local, state or national political organizations or
soliciting donations from co-workers for federal employee and
postal union political action committees.
   The president vetoed the bill last Friday, saying it ``would
inevitably lead to repoliticizing the federal work force'' and
``destroy its essential political neutrality.''
   There was no immediate word on whether congressional sponsors
would seek to write a bill more to the president's liking.
   The bill originally passed the Senate on a vote of 67-30. Bush
won his veto fight when three original Republican supporters _
Alfonse D'Amato of New York, Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico and
Trent Lott of Mississippi _ supported his veto.
   In addition, the White House picked up the support of Republican
Sens. Pete Wilson of California and Kit Bond of Missouri. Both had
missed the vote in May. All 55 Senate Democrats voted to override
Bush's veto.
   Just before the vote, Senate GOP Leader Bob Dole of Kansas
issued an appeal to his colleagues to support Bush, saying
supporters of the bill wanted only to give more power to federal
employee unions ``to raise more money to give to Democrats.''
   He said the law was enacted in 1939 ``as a remedy to gross
patronage abuses in the federal government.''
   ``The only diffence now is that, because of the Hatch Act, these
abuses are under control,'' he said. ``Without it, we'll be right
back where we started from. It probably won't happen overnight, but
it will happen.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., a supporter of the bill,
attributed the loss to White House pressure to maintain Bush's
perfect veto record.
   ``I regret that the merits are being overshadowed to extend the
president's unbroken string of vetoes,'' Kennedy said. ``It's time
to end the second-class status of federal workers in American
democracy.
   One senior Republican, Ted Stevens of Alaska, who voted for the
original measure, announced he would continue to support the bill.
   ``For the first time, I am asking the Senate not to sustain the
veto of this president,'' said Stevens. ``It's time that our
federal employees be made first-class citizens.''
   ``It ... would convert the present rule that partisan
politicking by federal civil servants is prohibited, into a
presumption that such partisan campaigning should be encouraged,''
he said.
   Stevens said he met with Bush's advisers to attempt to forge a
compromise, but was rebuffed by administration officials who he
said ``are caught up in the belief that government workers are
overwhelmingly Democrats.''
   ``That's just not true,'' Stevens said. ``States such as mine,
Colorado and California with large ... federal work forces
repeatedly elect Republicans.''
   The Senate approved the bill by a potentially veto-overriding
67-30 vote in May with unanimous support from the 54 Democrats.
Since then, former Rep. Daniel Akaka of Hawaii, who supports the
bill, has filled a 55th Democratic seat in the Senate vacated in
April by the death of Sen. Spark Matsunaga.
   The closest Bush has come to allowing Congress to enact a law
over his objections was last July, when 34 senators by a single
vote upheld his veto of a bill to impose conditions on his sale of
FSX jet fighter technology to Japan.
   ``We've been very lucky,'' Bush told a White House audience
recently. ``We may take one on the chin. ... But generally, the
Republican side has stayed together.''
   However, 84 Republicans, or nearly half of the GOP minority in
the House, including party leader Robert Michel of Illinois, bolted
from the administration Wednesday to support the Hatch revision
override.

   A decision by both German states to guarantee
Poland's existing borders is a crushing setback for millions of
Germans who dream of reclaiming their old homelands.
   East German lawmakers overwhelmingly approved such a guarantee
Thursday, and West German lawmakers were poised to follow suit.
   The declarations promise that a united Germany will not seek to
reclaim former lands carved away by the Allies after World War II
and ceded to Poland.
   The territories _ East Prussia, Silesia and Pomerania _ now
comprise one-third of Poland.
   While German unity to most of the world is the merger of East
Germany with its Western neighbor, other Germans say it will not be
complete until those old lands are also returned.
   ``You wouldn't believe how many phone calls we get these days,''
said Michael Lohr, a spokesman for the Bonn, West Germany-based
League of Expellees. ``People literally break down on the phone,
crying.''
   Lohr's group is the umbrella for 30 organizations with 2 million
members who have ties to the former lands. They hold gatherings and
festivals annually to mark their history and regional culture.
   Despite the resolutions, Lohr said there was nothing to prevent
the issue from being raised again after a united German parliament
is chosen, perhaps as early as December.
   ``It cannot be the end because these are not legally binding,''
he said.
   But it was with a note of finality that West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, in a speech to West German supporters, reaffirmed his
grudging support of such a resolution.
   ``There are many people in our country who will be deeply moved
and distressed by the statement given here today,'' Kohl said.
``They have strong emotional bonds with the country of their
forefathers. On a day like this they can feel nothing but grief.''
   Hitler's Germany invaded Poland in September 1939 and, under an
agreement with the Soviet Union, the Poland was split down the
center between the two countries.
   Six million Poles died during the war. About half of them were
Polish Jews who were exterminated in concentration camps spread
throughout the country.
   After the war, the three German areas west of the Oder-Neisse
River were ceded to Poland to compensate for an even larger section
of eastern Poland kept by the Soviets.
   Lohr said an estimated 10 million West Germans and about 4
million East Germans trace their roots to the three regions, which
are still home to about 800,000 ethnic Germans. Polish and Red
Cross estimates of the number of ethnic Germans are much lower.
   ``Our position was to keep as much of German territory as
possible and if it wasn't possible to keep any one of these eastern
provinces, we would like to see tougher negotiations,'' he said.
   Lohr said if the lands cannot be reclaimed, he said his group
wants Germans from the region, or their heirs, to be able to
reclaim their old property in the region.
   He said the resolutions, as written, would ``give away these
territories unconditionally.''
   The resolutions passed by both Parliaments call on Poland to
guarantee the cultural and legal rights of ethnic Germans.
   Kohl, who bases much of his political support on elements who
believe Germany has a right to the territories, caused a furor for
months before he finally said in March that he would agree to
support Poland's current borders.
   The guarantee was demanded by nations victimized by Germany's
history of hunger for other lands. It is a symbolic promise the new
Germany will not become like the old one.
   ``The German-Polish border is final,'' said West German Foreign
Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher. ``Without finality of the
Oder-Neisse border there will not be peace in Europe.''

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev accused his
hard-line critics of slander Thursday and faced the prospect that
one of them would be elected head of the Russian republic's
Communist Party.
   Gorbachev was put on the defensive for a third day when a
Leningrad economist claimed he did not obtain party approval to
switch the Soviet Union to a market economy.
   ``To consider that this idea and program dropped from the sky,
or that somebody is undertaking an overnight coup to change our
course, that is slander,'' Gorbachev told the Congress of Russian
Communists. A nationwide broadcast showed him angrily waving his
hand in the air as he spoke.
   Numerous conservatives at the meeting, which began Tuesday, have
attacked the 59-year-old Kremlin chief's political and economic
reforms. The hard-liners have indicated they will try to replace
Gorbachev as party leader at a national party congress starting
July 2.
   Gorbachev also might have to deal with a conservative party
leader in Russia, the largest of the 15 Soviet republics.
   Nearly all the seven candidates announced Thursday for first
secretary of the Russian party are conservatives. Four of them gave
election speeches, and the front-runner appeared to be Ivan
Polozkov, one of Gorbachev's critics and one of Boris Yeltsin's
unsuccessful opponents in the race for the presidency of the
Russian republic.
   Polozkov, the 55-year-old party chief of the southern Russian
region of Krasnodar, received the most applause. At the urging of
delegates, he was allowed to speak at least three times longer than
the other three candidates who addressed the delegates.
   Polozkov has called for strict party discipline, condemned
informal political groups, complained tht older party members are
not respected and cracked down on cooperatives _ private businesses
introduced by Gorbachev.
   In a speech Wednesday, he blamed the party's falling credibility
in part on Gorbachev's reform program and said, ``The crisis is not
just in the Communist Party, but above all in its leading bodies.''
   On Thursday, Polozkov portrayed himself as a moderate intent on
saving the party ``from reprisals on the inside from the left and
right.''
   He denied he opposed democratic forces or cooperatives.
   Gorbachev did not comment on the candidates for Russian party
chief but did shoot back at hard-liners who accuse him of taking
the party out of the decision-making process. He cited numerous
meetings of the party leadership where officials decided on the
need for radical economic reform, including a market economy.
   ``Don't be suspicious that something is being done secretly to
turn the rails and move the country in the direction of
capitalism,'' Gorbachev said.
   ``These attempts are rotten, improper, made by people who seek a
completely different goal from ours, which is to find new forms of
life and make the lives of people better,'' he said.
   The audience, 2,700 delegates to the founding congress of a
Russian Communist Party, applauded briefly.
   Gorbachev was alluding to a complaint made Wednesday by
prominent conservative Yegor Ligachev, who said Gorbachev made
crucial decisions without consulting the Politburo, the Communist
Party's 12-man ruling body.
   His complaints underscored conservative concern that Gorbachev
has shifted power from the party to newly elected legislative
bodies, and to the new post of president _ a title Gorbachev holds
along with national party leader.
   The changes mean that Gorbachev may now be strong enough to
remain the Soviet leader even if he no longer heads the Communist
Party. There has been speculation for months that he planned to
step down from his party post and exercise his power as president.
   The 2,700 Communists of the Russian congress will be the
majority of the 4,700 delegates at next month's national party
congress. Reformers have complained they were bypassed in the
selection of delegates.
   Among the other candidates for Russian party chief is Alexander
Melnikov, a hard-line Communist from Siberia who demanded Tuesday
that Gorbachev resign as general secretary.
   Other candidates are Valentin Kuptsov, head of a party Central
Committee department; Oleg Shenin, party chief of Krasnoyarsk, Oleg
Lobov, second secretary of Armenia's Communist Party; and Nikolai
Polovodov, a Leningrad worker. The only known progressive candidate
is Vladimir Lysenko, a leader of the radical Democratic Platform
group.

   The House today brushed aside last-ditch
delaying efforts and pushed toward what Speaker Thomas S. Foley
said would be this year's only vote on a constitutional amendment
against flag burning.
   ``A tough choice, a choice that we would have hoped to have
avoided,'' said House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo.,
who opposes an amendment. ``We simply cannot protect the flag and
refuse to erode the Bill of Rights at the same time.''
   A Supreme Court decision June 11 threw out a federal law passed
last year against desecration of the American flag and rekindled
debate over a constitutional amendment that was sidetracked last
year.
   The proposed amendment would allow the federal government and
the states to ban burning or other desecration of the American flag.
   Critics of the amendment expressed increasing confidence that it
would not win the two-thirds support it would need for approval.
Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., told a hearing of his Senate
Judiciary Committee that ``the House is going to defeat this
amendment.''
   Foley told reporters that ``whatever happens today is the final
action.''
   ``We're not going to go around and around and around and
around,'' the Washington Democrat told a morning news conference.
   The House voted 231-192 to press ahead with five hours of debate
followed by a vote on the amendment despite appeals for more time
for lobbying by the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars
and Amvets. Lawmakers said it did not necessarily reflect sentiment
for the amendment.
   Emotional appeals to patriotism and warnings against tampering
with the Constitution's guarantee of free speech rang out in the
chamber as the House debate got under way.
   A panoramic picture of the Iwo Jima Memorial showing Marines
hoisting the flag over Mount Suribachi was brought to the floor
beside a photo of a flaming flag in Central Park, where ``the gooks
and the goons held it up in open rebellion,'' said Rep. James
Quillen, R-Tenn. He afterward defined ``gooks'' as ``people who
don't care.''
   ``Are we so fragile as a nation that we cannot rise above such
cheap tactics'' as flag burning, asked Rep. David E. Skaggs,
D-Colo. ``What assurance is there that this excision in the Bill of
Rights, once breached, would not lead to others?''
   Foley appeared to rule out a suggestion by Senate Minority
Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., even if the House rejected the measure the
first time around the Senate could approve it and send it back,
possibly in modified form.
   ``We will vote today on this matter for the final time this
session,'' Foley told a morning news conference. On Wednesday, he
said some of the measure's supporters had given way to ``crass
political opportunism'' and would ``hurt their own cause by that
kind of egregious political snickering.''
   As the intensity picked up Wednesday, supporters promised to
carry on their campaign even if the amendment is defeated on the
House floor.
   ``If they think this issue goes away on Friday, they have no
comprehension of what's going on out there,'' said Republican Whip
Newt Gingrich of Georgia. ``And I expect that if we do lose, you'll
see more anger and outrage than if we win.''
   Backers and opponents of the amendment said it likely would not
muster the necessary two-thirds margin in the House.
   President Bush said Wednesday in Huntsville, Ala., that a
``carefully drawn amendment to make burning of the American flag a
crime'' is needed because the flag is a unique symbol.
   Republicans on Capitol Hill, however, grumbled that the White
House should have done more one-on-one lobbying.
   Democratic leaders have been campaigning against the amendment
on grounds that it would undermine the constitutional guarantee of
free speech.
   The amendment would allow the federal government and the states
to ban burning or otherwise desecrating the American flag.
   To become part of the Constitution, the amendment needed 289
votes in the House and 67 in the Senate plus ratification by 38
state legislatures.
   In the Senate, Democratic Whip Alan Cranston of California said
his count was 54 in favor, 29 opposed and 17 on the fence.
   Meanwhile, former federal Judge Robert Bork was testifying today
before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the proposed amendment.
   The House planned six hours of debate followed by a vote on the
amendment. After that, the lawmakers planned to vote on a simple
statute that would ban flag burning.
   The amendment was debated heavily last year after the Supreme
Court struck down a Texas law that banned flag burning. But
lawmakers ultimately passed a law to ban flag burning instead of a
constitutional amendment.
   The Supreme Court last week declared the statute
unconstitutional, rekindling debate over the constitutional
amendment.
   House debate took on an acid tone Wednesday as Rep. Gerald
Solomon, R-N.Y., told critics that in pushing for a quick vote they
were ``gagging 10 million veterans through this nation'' and
``kowtowing to ilk like the Communist Youth Brigade.''
   Democrats objected and Solomon eventually apologized. The
remarks were stricken from the record.
   The sharp words, however, underlined the intensity of emotions
in the House over the issue. Foley, asked about Gingrich's remarks,
said some sponsors ``are concerned, apparently, about the political
issue and the political opportunities they think this represents.''
   ``I don't think the American people are going to respond
favorably to that,'' Foley said. ``What I don't think they are
going to appreciate and support is crass political opportunism, a
kind of wringing their hands gleefully and saying, this is where we
are going to clean up.''
   Veterans' groups had sought to mount a grassroots lobbying
campaign for the amendment but were caught off guard by the swift
move to whisk the bill to the House floor.
   ``We fail to see why it is so necessary to rush this legislation
to a vote on Thursday,'' said Walter G. Hogan, national commander
of the Veterans of Foreign Wars.

   At least 10,000 people died today in an
earthquake that jolted northern Iran, demolishing scores of
villages and towns and burying thousands in the rubble of their
homes, an official announcement said.
   A statement by the Iranian Cabinet, released after an emergency
evening session, said the ``sad, painful and horrible tragedy has
so far claimed 10,000 lives and left thousands of others wounded.''
   The announcement, carried by the Islamic Republic News Agency,
placed all government organizations ``on full alert'' and ordered
an air bridge set up between Tehran and the stricken areas to
evacuate survivors.
   Landslides obstructed the mission of rescuers on the ground, and
bad weather was hindering airlift operations by helicopters, IRNA
said.
   It said many people were still buried in the debris, and that
several hundred Revolutionary Guards were flown from Tehran after
nighfall to join rescue teams.
   The White House sent condolences to the Iranian leadership, and
expressed willingness to offer ``appropriate humanitarian
assistance should it be requested.''
   The Geophysics Center at Tehran University said the quake
measured 7.3 on the Richter scale of ground motion. The U.S.
Geological Survey measured it at 7.7.
   The Tehran center recorded 12 aftershocks after the early
morning quake, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   The quake struck at 12:30 a.m., when most people were either
sleeping or watching World Cup soccer on television. IRNA quoted
the Geophysics Center as saying it was centered 125 miles northwest
of Tehran, near the Caspian Sea.
   The quake also rattled the bordering Soviet republic of
Azerbaijan, slightly damaging some old buildings in its capital of
Baku but causing no casualties, the Soviet news agency Tass said.
   The temblor killed at least 1,600 people and injured 3,600 in
Iran's Zanjan province, and killed 300 and injured more than 1,000
in Gilan province, IRNA said in dispatches monitored in Cyprus.
   It said the dead included at least 1,000 people killed in one
large village in Zanjan province, Ab-Dar, the agency said. At least
88 people were killed in Qazvin just 80 miles northwest of Tehran.
   It was not immediately clear where the thousands of other deaths
occurred.
   IRNA said homes crumbled and landslides loosed by the shock were
blocking main roads, hampering rescue efforts.
   The mountainous, largely agricultural provinces have a combined
population of 2.7 million and the news agency said several villages
near the 100,000-resident provincial capital of Zanjan were
destroyed.
   Tehran residents said the quake shattered windows and sent
people fleeing into the streets. They reported no casualties or
serious damage in the capital.
   President Hashemi Rafsanjani declared three days of mourning and
ordered all state organs to be ready to aid in the relief efforts.
Spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei flew to the area and called
the quake a divine test.
   ``The bereaved and other people should pass this test with pride
through their patience, endeavor, cooperation and assistance,'' he
said in a radio dispatch monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp.
   IRNA said an unspecified number of people were killed and
injured in the Caspian port city of Rasht. It said houses collapsed
in the Gilan province capital of 189,000 people, which is 175 miles
northwest of Tehran.
   The agency said the ``exact number of casualties and the extent
of losses were still unknown'' and that rescuers and relief teams
had set up headquarters in Rasht.
   Scenes shown on state television and monitored in Cyprus showed
young men frantically clawing at debris from pancaked concrete
buildings. Occasionally, they carried away a victim on a stretcher.
Bulldozers cleared larger pieces of debris. Women in black chadors
camped out in the city's public squares, afraid to return to their
homes.
   A dam south of Rasht burst, flooding the surrounding area, IRNA
said.
   Three U.S.-made C-130 transport planes shuttled between Tehran
and Rasht to carry the injured to hospitals in the capital, it
said. State-run Iran Air ordered special flights to carry the
injured.
   Russ Needham, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey's
National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo., said the
quake was centered in the Caspian Sea about 15 miles off the
Iranian coast.
   Needham said preliminary data put the epicenter 210 miles
northwest of Tehran and 160 miles south of Baku.
   The region is prone to earthquakes. A quake registering 6.9 on
the Richter scale struck nearby Soviet Armenia Dec. 7, 1988,
killing 25,000 people.
   The previous worst quake in Iran itself, registering 7.7 on the
Richter scale, hit eastern regions of the country on Sept. 16,
1978, also killing 25,000 people.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. An earthquake with a magnitude of 7 is capable of
widespread, heavy damage while an earthquake measuring 8 is capable
of tremendous damage.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Four gunmen, including two in army
uniforms, opened fire Thursday on a meeting of the governing
Council of State, killing a union activist and wounding two
politicians, witnesses said.
   The attack occurred in a hotel courtyard where the 19-member
council was meeting with union, political and business leaders to
deal with a wave of violent crime.
   The assailants burst into the courtyard and sprayed the group
with M-16 rifle fire, according to witnesses and independent radio
reports.
   Two attackers wore army uniforms and two wore civilian clothes,
the reports said.
   A truckload of soldiers arrived at the hotel, in a mainly
residential area of Port-au-Prince, about a half-hour later.
   The civilian council governs alongside President Ertha
Pascal-Trouillot. She was not present at the meeting and her office
had issued no statement by late afternoon.
   Witnesses and Radio Antilles identified the dead man as union
activist Jean-Marie Montes.
   Council member Serge Villard was wounded in the stomach and
Emmanuel Mani, a member of the socialist National Progressive
Party, was wounded in the thigh, the reports said. Both were
hospitalized.
   The apparent involvement of soldiers raised concerns about the
army's intentions as Haiti moves toward what would be its first
democratically elected government since independence from France in
1804. The presidential election is scheduled for September.
   ``It is horrible,'' said Rene Theodore, leader of the Haitian
Communist Party. ``It doesn't seem the government can cope with the
situation ... If the problem is not resolved, it is difficult to
hold elections with serenity.''
   Haiti's last indendepently run elections, on Nov. 29, 1987, were
aborted when thugs supported by the army shot and hacked to death
at least 34 voters at polling stations.
   The Army High Command pledged to support Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot
when was appointed president in March to replace Lt. Gen. Prosper
Avril. Avril fled into exile after widespread protests in this
country of 5.3 million against his military government.
   But skeptics have questioned the willingness of the
ill-disciplined and corrupt force to relinquish privileges gained
over many years.
   Many have asked why security forces have not done more to try to
stop the crime wave, in which 13 people have been killed in
Port-au-Prince since Tuesday.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot has made no public statement since Monday,
when she said illness had forced her to cancel a scheduled meeting
with U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar in New York.
   The president and the Council of State, which has veto power
over her decisions, have been in a dispute over her appointment of
Marie Violene Legangneur as finance minister.
   Council members regard Legangneur as a sympathizer of the
29-year dictatorship of Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier, who fled
into exile in 1986, and of his late father, Francois ``Papa Doc.''
   The council has said it will not approve any electoral law
signed by the finance minister. The law is necessary to hold
general elections.
   Haiti, the first republic of former slaves, gained independence
from France in 1804 and has since been governed mostly by
repressive military rulers.

   The parliament of Soviet Georgia has decided to
ignore President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's embargo on Lithuania and
begin trading with the Baltic republic, Tass reported Thursday.
   Another Soviet republic, Moldavia, already has taken similar
action. The president of the Russian republic, Boris Yeltsin, has
called for an end to the embargo, and he has discussed direct trade
with Lithuanian officials.
   Lithuania declared independence March 11, and Gorbachev cut off
all oil, most natural gas and many raw materials shipments to the
republic to try to force it to back down.
   Last week, under growing domestic pressure to end the economic
sanctions, the Soviet government restored 15 percent of the
republic's natural gas needs.
   The Georgian parliament also recognized ``the right to
self-determination and the political will of Lithuania, Latvia and
Estonia and all union republics to create truly sovereign states,''
said Tass, the official Soviet news agency.
   The parliament also expressed readiness to establish direct
inter-state political and economic relations with them.
   Georgia's action supporting the three Baltic states came
Wednesday in a special legislative session, where the parliament
created a commission to work on restoring its own independence.
   Georgia is southeast of the Baltics in the Caucasus Mountains.
While the Baltics were occupied by the Red Army and forcibly
annexed to the Soviet Union in 1940, Georgia was occupied and lost
its independence in 1921.
   Neither Georgia nor the three Baltic republics has a population
of more than 6 million.
   Tass said the Georgian parliament also approved a bill allowing
alternative labor to military service.
   Avoiding the Soviet army draft has become a strong concern in
many republics, partly because of deadly hazing practices.
   In addition, many young men do not want to be called into action
to put down domestic ethnic violence or harrass independence
governments, as the army has been called upon to do in recent years.

<HEAD>Government Sees Farm Income Improving</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The outlook for farmers continues to improve
this year, according to new income estimates released Wednesday by
the Agriculture Department.
   Sales of farm commodities ``are showing some unexpected
strength, so income prospects have brightened'' since the last 1990
forecast was issued three months ago, the department's Economic
Research Service said in its outlook report.
   ``Strong hog prices and firming coarse grain prices are behind
the improvement,'' the report said. Coarse grains include corn,
sorghum, oats and barley.
   Overall, the ``net cash income'' of farmers was forecast at $55
billion to $59 billion this year, up $1 billion from the range
indicated since March. Last year's net cash income was about $54
billion, and the record was $57.2 billion in 1988.
   As used by the agency, net cash income ``measures the value of
commodities sold in a calendar year plus government payments, less
out-of-pocket costs.'' Some commodities may have been produced in
earlier years and stored until marketed.
   In another method of accounting, the report said ``net farm
income'' may be in the range of $47 billion to $51 billion, a $2
billion increase from the earlier 1990 forecast. Last year's was
$49 billion, a record.
   Net farm income is used to measure the value of agricultural
production, whether sold or stored, in a calendar year plus
government payments, minus all costs, including depreciation and
other allowances.

   Mandela fever now grips Boston, but what happens
after the Free South Africa T-shirts sell out and the last chorus
of ``We Shall Overcome'' is sung?
   Longtime anti-apartheid activists say Nelson Mandela's one-day
visit Saturday could have a positive effect on a city often wracked
with racial tensions, most recently during the highly publicized
Stuart murder investigation.
   But some warn that the ovations and oratory that will greet the
African National Congress leader do not substitute for real change
_ either here or in South Africa.
   Boston is Mandela's second U.S. stop. His itinerary includes a
stop at the predominantly black Madison Park High School, a
motorcade through the Roxbury section, a luncheon at the John F.
Kennedy Library and a rally on the Boston Esplanade.
   ``He has a message of making a non-racial society,'' said Mel
King, a former state representative and mayoral candidate. ``It
seems to me it will encourage the people who want to build a
non-racial community.''
   Mandela, released in February after 27 years in prison in South
Africa, is on a six-week tour of 13 countries to raise money for
ANC and encourage countries to keep pressure on the white-minority
South African government.
   ``He's a tremendous figure for young people, an extraordinary
opportunity to meet a contemporary hero,'' said Margaret Burnham,
chairman of the Fund for a Free South Africa.
   To many American blacks the 71-year-old Mandela ``represents
what could have been,'' said state Rep. Byron Rushing, who has
backed anti-apartheid legislation. Mandela is similar in age to
what Malcolm X or the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. would have been,
had they lived, he noted.
   ``Most Americans feel a kind of moral leadership vacuum.
Everybody's hero is dead. Here's a live one. That's what you see in
this big ovation,'' Rushing said.
   Rushing, however, said it would be a mistake to think Mandela's
sudden popularity would translate into domestic changes. ``That is
a cop-out. Things happen because people organize and persevere,''
he said.
   The significance of the red carpet treatment for Mandela lies in
the implication that for the first time the black community has
shaped American foreign policy, Rushing said. Mandela's is a
political, not spiritual, mission, he said.
   ``People are trying to make this into a pope's visit,'' he said.
``It's not.''
   Racial conflicts rocked Boston during the late 1960s and early
1970s over court-ordered busing to integrate public schools. Most
recently, tensions were heightened in fall when Charles Stuart told
police a black mugger jumped in his car in Boston, shot his
pregnant wife dead and wounded him. After the white businessman
apparently committed suicide in January, prosecutors said Stuart
himself plotted to kill his wife and concocted the mugger story.
   Longtime anti-apartheid activist Richard Clapp said Mandela's
visit could be part of a healing process among Boston ethnic groups.
   ``This is a person who's a beacon around the world for
resistance to unjust regimes,'' he said.
   But Sadiki Kambon, director of the Black Community Information
Center, predicts the majority of people at the Madison Park School
and along the motorcade will be black and the majority of those
attending the Esplanade concert _ featuring Paul Simon, Jackson
Browne and Bobby McFerrin _ will be white.
   ``I don't believe his visit is going to affect the racial
tensions in this city one way or another,'' Kambon said.
   Yet Mandela's visit retains deep significance for
African-Americans.
   ``Just his mere presence is an inspiration, especially to young
people,'' Kambon said.

<HEAD>Pentagon Calls For Adequate Severance Pay For Enlisted Men And
Women</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A soldier with more than seven years' service
and a family to support doesn't want a handout but does need
adequate severance pay and health benefits as the military scales
down, Pentagon advisers said on Wednesday.
   Recent debate over significant reductions in President Bush's
$303.3billion budget has focused on Air Force fighter wings, Army
divisions, Navy ships and base closings.
   But the Pentagon's senior enlisted personnel advisers, in
testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee on a bill to
provide increased and special benefits to those involuntarily
separated from the military, put faces on the reduction numbers.
   ``Spouses and even some of the children are becoming uneasy with
the future outlook,'' Army Sergeant Maj. Julius W. Gates told the
panel on manpower and personnel.
   Duane Bushey, master chief petty officer of the Navy, said the
overriding concern among enlisted sailors let go after more than
five years on the job is not an improvement in their education
benefits but enough separation pay.
   ``At that point they're looking to survive. They want to put
meat and potatoes on the table. Most with a family are looking to
feed the family,'' Bushey said.
   Gates said Army personnel ``are not asking for free handouts or
welfare, but the quality soldiers subject to force reductions want
some form of separation pay and need some form of transitional
medical care.''
   Later in the day, Senate and House Democrats introduced
legislation that will assist the nation's communities that have
been dependent on the defense buildup of the 1980s as they adjust
to a reduced military spending.
   Touted by House Majority Leader Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., as
a plan ``to move our economy from a Cold War footing to a new era
of vitality,'' the bill would create a high-level federal office to
assist defense adjustment, provide grants to communities to start
adjustment planning and require advance notification to
communities, workers and businesses of planned cuts.
   The legislation eases the change from a ``war-oriented economy
to a peace economy,'' Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., a member of the
House Armed Services Committee, told reporters.
   Last month, Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and William Cohen,
R-Maine, introduced legislation that would ease the pain for
military personnel _ especially enlisted men and women in uniform _
from the cuts in defense spending.
   Severe budget constraints and the easing of the Soviet threat to
the West has prompted a loud, long call in Congress for slashing
defense spending. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney argued on Tuesday
that House and Senate plans to cut the budget would force layoffs
of a third of the 3.1 million military and civilian workers on the
Pentagon's payrolls.
   The Senate bill is a package of severance pay, health benefits,
relocation and job counseling for those forced out of the service
with more than seven years' experience and before they are eligible
for retirement.
   The current Pentagon system provides separation pay at 10
percent of annual basic pay times the number of years of service
for officers who have five or more years of service. The amount of
pay is capped at $30,000.
   The Senate legislation would raise the cap to $83,500.
   The Pentagon on Wednesday proposed its own plan that is similar
to the Senate bill but would affect personnel with five years of
service who are on active duty at the time the bill is enacted.
   ``We have a personnel crisis of nearly unprecedented
proportions,'' McCain said at the hearing.
   Army officials told the panel that the service is planning a
reduction of 20,000 soldiers in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1
and 35,000 soldiers per year after that. Cuts greater than that
would force the Army to layoff mid-career officers and
noncommissioned officers.
   Navy officials said budget cuts in fiscal 1991 will result in a
reduction of 494 officers and 5,207 enlisted personnel. However,
the cuts will come through reduced accessions and not involuntary
separation.
   The Marine Corps said it has no plans for such layoffs while the
Air Force did not provide estimates.

   Federal deficit spending totaled $151.68
billion in the first eight months of fiscal 1990, 34 percent ahead
of the overspending pace for the same period a year ago, the
Treasury Department reported Thursday.
   Deficit spending in May was $42.55 billion, following a record
surplus a month earlier during income tax time, the department said.
   Many analysts now believe the deficit could top $200 billion by
the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30.
   The imbalance also was well above the $100 billion target set by
the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law.
   ``This just puts more pressure on Congress and the White House
to come up with a credible budget plan,'' said William V. Sullivan
Jr., money market research director for Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc.,
in New York.
   ``The smoke and mirrors just won't help any more,'' he added.
   White House and congressional leaders currently are negotiating
a package of budget cuts and increased revenues designed to meet
the $64 billion Gramm-Rudman deficit target for fiscal 1991 that
begins Oct. 1.
   The Bush administration budget last January projected the 1990
deficit to be $123.8 billion, although officials admit it will be
revised upward because of the unexpected costs of the savings and
loan bailout, increased interest rates and less-than-expected
revenue because of a sluggish economy.
   The Congressional Budget Office in March projected the deficit
at $159 billion.
   April's record surplus of $42.52 billion, due to a surge in
income tax payments, had followed a record $53.34 billion deficit
in March.
   Revenues in May totaled $69.21 billion, down 2.7 percent from
the comparable month last year. Spending, on the other hand, rose
15.9 percent to $111.76.
   The outlays included $7.27 billion by the Resolution Trust
Corp., the government agency charged with bailing out the savings
and loan industry.
   Revenues for the first eight months of fiscal 1990 totaled
$667.13 billion, up 4.1 percent from the same period of 1989.
Spending totaled $111.76 billion, a 15.9 percent increase over the
first eight months of the last fiscal year.
   The biggest spending categories, as usual, were the military,
Social Security and other programs for the Department of Health and
Human Services, and interest on the national debt.
   Military spending totaled $25.56 billion in May and $192.42
billion so far this year. It is projected to total $286.79 billion
for the entire fiscal year.
   Social Security payments amounted to $20.57 billion for the
month and $158.81 billion for the year so far. They are projected
to total $244.59 billion for the year.
   Other HHS payments including Medicare and Medicaid totaled
$16.75 billion during May and $126.21 billion thus far. They are
projected to total $191.17 billion in fiscal 1990.
   Interest on the national debt amounted to $21.65 billion for the
month and $168.15 billion so far this year. It is projected to
total $254.85 billion for the entire year.

   The Pentagon revised its figures again
Thursday on the number of soldiers accidentally wounded by their
comrades in the Panama invasion, reducing the number by one. It was
the second time this week it has dropped the count.
   On Tuesday, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said 16 out of 310
soldiers wounded in action were hit by so-called ``friendly fire,''
but Williams said Thursday that additional study has revealed that
actually 15 men out of 311 wounded in the invasion were hit that
way.
   On Monday, the department had said 19 of some 324 soldiers
wounded in action had been accidentally wounded by their comrades.
   Williams said a review of videotape taken by an Air Force AC-130
gunship does show an incident of possible friendly fire involving
another 21 U.S. Army soldiers during the Dec. 20 military operation.
   But the spokesman said it still is ``impossible to determine''
whether their injuries came from the fire of the gunship's cannon
or mortar fire from the Panamanian Defense Forces.
   The video, taken at night in the area of the battle for the
Panamanian Defense Forces headquarters at the Commandancia
``doesn't show impact. You can't tell a lot'' from the video,
Williams said.
   ``We have been analyzing the tape and continue to do so,'' he
added.
   Williams said the Pentagon stands by its initial count that two
_ and perhaps three _ U.S. servicemen had been killed by friendly
fire during the Panama operation. The third case was still under
study, Williams said.
   The spokesman said he believed those families that requested to
know the circumstances of their relatives' deaths had been informed
whether or not if involved friendly fire, but some families asked
not to be given such information.
   The Pentagon's disclosure of the dead and wounded from friendly
fire was prompted by a Newsweek magazine report that nine U.S.
soldiers had been killed by their comrades and that more than 60
percent of those wounded had been hit by friendly fire.

<HEAD>Doctor Says Hopkins Medical School Tried to Block His Talk</HEAD>

   An AIDS-infected doctor who sued Johns
Hopkins medical school accused the school Thursday of trying to
block him from delivering a speech at the international AIDS
conference.
   Dr. Hacib Aoun said the school filed an injunction to prevent
him from delivering a speech that dealt in part with discrimination
he said he had suffered at the hands of Hopkins.
   Paul Rosenberg, vice president and general counsel for the Johns
Hopkins Health System in Baltimore, said, ``We did in fact seek
guidance of a court with respect to Dr. Aoun's speech.'' He
responded to Aoun's charges through a statement released by a
Hopkins spokeswoman.
   Aoun is a Venezuelan doctor who contracted AIDS in 1983 when a
tube of a patient's blood broke in his hands and cut his finger. He
was then a doctor in training at the Johns Hopkins Hospital.
   Although Hopkins says Aoun had distinguished himself in his
career, his contract was not renewed after he was diagnosed with
AIDS in 1986.
   He filed a lawsuit that led to a bitter confrontation and
ultimately was settled in December 1987. He did not return to
Hopkins. Details of the settlement were kept secret as a condition
of the settlement.
   Aoun has since lectured and written on the tragedy of AIDS
discrimination. In a moving speech Thursday at the Sixth
International Conference on AIDS, he said his experience was a
nightmare.
   ``We had to sue the hospital to get health benefits,'' he said.
Such actions as Hopkins' attempt to deny benefits ``send a terrible
message to health workers,'' he said.
   That was the speech that Hopkins had attempted to block, Aoun
said.
   ``It wasn't to prevent him from speaking,'' Rosenberg said. ``We
actually wanted to see his speech.''
   Last week, Hopkins officials asked the conference's program
director, Dr. Robert Wachter, for a copy of Aoun's speech. Wachter
told Hopkins he didn't have a copy, according to Hopkins
spokeswoman Marion Glick.
   ``He said the request would have to go to Dr. Aoun,'' Glick said.
   A judge reviewed the legal filing by Hopkins and required Aoun
to slightly modify his speech before delivering it, Rosenberg said.
   Hopkins sought a copy of the speech to determine whether Aoun
was violating the secrecy agreement in the lawsuit settlement,
Glick said.
   ``We never saw his speech and we don't know what modifications
were made to his speech,'' said Glick. ``The judge did all of
that.''
   ``We have never had any intention to restrict Dr. Aoun from
discussing policy issues related to AIDS, HIV testing, health care
or benefits for HIV infected persons,'' Rosenberg said in his
statement.

   U.S. religious leaders on Thursday gave $200,000
and a hero's welcome to Nelson Mandela, who responded by calling
them his ``comrades in arms'' in the battle to dismantle apartheid.
   ``From a theological perspective, I do think that God raises up
giants of the faith for society, and I think this is one that God
has raised,'' said Presiding Bishop Edmond L. Browning of the
Episcopal Church.
   The gathering of more than 100 church leaders, representing
Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox, Jewish and Muslim groups, cheered
loudly as the 71-year-old deputy president of the once-banned
African National Congress called upon South African leaders ``to
confess the sins they have committed.''
   Mandela, who was released Feb. 11 after a 27-year imprisonment,
said churches have played a decisive role in the anti-apartheid
fight.
   ``You are our comrades in arms, you are our brothers and
sisters. We feel perfectly at home with you,'' Mandela told the
gathering sponsored by the National Council of Churches, the
nation's largest ecumenical organization.
   Mandela asked church leaders to keep up pressure on the South
African government, referring to economic sanctions as ``one of the
prices we are prepared to pay'' to bring about democratic rule in
South Africa.
   In addition to giving $200,000 to the ANC, the religious leaders
Thursday approved a document entitled ``The New York Declaration''
calling for continued support of U.S. government sanctions against
South Africa and for the release of all political prisoners.
   ``I will do everything in terms of my office to influence the
president,'' said Browning, the spiritual leader of the
denomination of which President Bush is a member. ``I don't think
we can remove sanctions until the people of South Africa are free.''
   Bush, scheduled to meet with Mandela next week, reiterated
Wednesday that the United States will continue its sanctions until
South Africa meets certain requirements, including the release of
all political prisoners.
   Bishop John Ricard of the Archdiocese of Baltimore, representing
the U.S. Catholic Conference, said Mandela's presence vindicates
years of church pressure on the South African government, including
the divestment of its own holdings in companies doing business
there.
   ``I think, right now, the role of the churches is to help the
African National Congress and Mr. Mandela develop the
infrastructure'' that will be needed once apartheid is dismantled.
   Several Moslem and Jewish leaders joined to honor the
anti-apartheid leader despite their differing views of Mandela's
support for the Palestine Liberation Organization and his
comparison of the struggle of Palestinians to that of black South
Africans.
   ``We have something in common. We cannot separate,'' said Dawud
Assad, president of the Council of Masajid of North America. ``To
us he is a great hero.''
   Mohamed Khan, president of the Islamic Congress of the United
States, said, ``The principle that Mandela is standing up for is an
Islamic principle: equality and justice.''
   It is also a Jewish principle, said Rabbi Alexander Schindler,
president of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations.
   ``Our faith has always taught us until all human beings are
free, no one is free,'' he said.
   Schindler, who noted the black nationalist leader also has
supported Israel's right to exist within secure borders, said his
presence was a symbol of Jewish support for Mandela and the desire
of American Jews to strengthen their alliance with blacks in the
fight for civil rights.
   ``The man is an unusual spirit, an incandescent spirit in our
generation,'' he said.

<HEAD>Detectives: NYC Park Shooting May be Linked to Zodiac Gunman</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A note found near the victim of a pre-dawn
shooting in Central Park on Thursday may link the attack to a
``Zodiac'' gunman who claimed to have shot three men, police said.
   A passerby notified police shortly after 5 a.m. that a man had
been shot in Central Park. The victim, described only as a black
man in his 20s, was hospitalized in critical condition with a
gunshot wound to the chest, authorities said.
   A note was found nearby, said a police source speaking on
condition of anonymity. The note's contents were not revealed, but
the source said it led detectives to believe the Zodiac gunman may
be linked to the Manhattan shooting.
   All four shootings occurred on Thursdays and before dawn.
   The gunman, in three cryptic notes referring to the signs of the
Zodiac, claimed responsibility for three shootings since March 8.
Two were in the same Brooklyn neighborhood, one in an adjoining
Queens neighborhood.
   Although the gunman's notes indicated he had murdered his
victims, the wounded men, two Hispanics and a white, survived.
   Detectives found the first note near the body of a man shot on
May 31; the two other notes were mailed to the New York Post and
the CBS's ``60 Minutes.''
   The notes began ``This is the Zodiac,'' and contained the phrase
``The twelve sign will die when the belts in the heaven are seen,''
police said.
   The notes contained accurate descriptions of the victims, as
well as the times, dates and places they were shot.
   Chief of Detectives Joseph Borrelli said that the gunman is not
believed to be the man who, calling himself ``The Zodiac,'' claimed
responsibility for as many as 40 killings in a series of notes sent
to San Francisco-area newspapers from 1968 to 1987.
   The San Francisco Zodiac was never captured.
   A psychological profile of the New York gunman indicates he is a
man of limited education, with a desperate need for attention. He
probably lives alone or is a loner and may be unemployed, the
police profile suggests.

   James Cason, who was rejected last year by the
Senate for a top job in the Agriculture Department, is working as
deputy manager of the Federal Crop Insurance Corp., the agency said
Thursday.
   Last November Cason, 35, asked the White House to withdraw his
nomination as assistant secretary for natural resources and the
environment.
   Cason's withdrawal effectively ended an eight-month battle over
his nomination between President Bush and environmentalists, who
were supported by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate
Agriculture Committee.
   Opposition was led by the Sierra Club, National Wildlife
Federation, Wilderness Society, League of Conservation Voters and
National Audubon Society.
   The groups alleged Cason's record in several top Interior
Department positions during the Reagan administration showed
favoritism toward development of public lands, despite
environmental concerns.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, who cleared Cason for the
new $79,200-a-year USDA job, had strongly supported the nomination
and had characterized the opposition as ``both misguided and
unfair.''
   The Federal Crop Insurance Corp., which provides subsidized
insurance to farmers to help protect them from losses due to
drought and other natural disasters, said Cason joined the agency
on May 6.

<HEAD>NATO Summit to Look at Ways to Build New Security Order in Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY DUNPHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO leaders will consider practical ways of
building a new order to guarantee peace in Europe at next month's
summit, an alliance official said Thursday.
   NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner said that as the Western
alliance moved away from a strategy based on confrontation with the
Warsaw Pact, it would seek to include the Soviet Union as a ``full
partner in the new order.''
   The July 5-6 summit of NATO leaders in London comes at a time
when the alliance is seeking to change its role to reflect the
rapid moves toward German unification and the relaxing of East-West
tensions following the democratic upheaval in the Soviet bloc.
   Woerner told the Anglo American Press Association of Paris that
new security arrangements for Europe had to be developed within
existing institutions, such as the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and the European Community.
   But he also called for an increased role for the 35-nation
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), which
includes the United States, the Soviet Union, Canada, and East and
Central European countries.
   Woerner said the NATO leaders at their summit would discuss
setting up within the CSCE framework a verification center for arms
control and a crisis solution center.
   Woerner also said there could be more regular meetings of the
CSCE foreign ministers and heads of government and the
establishment of a small secretariat. The CSCE process was
established at a meeting in Helsinki, Finland, in 1975.
   Asked whether he thought a European Security Council should be
established as part of this process, Woerner said he thought such a
body might be set up later after European nations had some
experience with the kinds of problems that developed.
   He said there was no need for any European code of conduct
because it was already contained in the agreement that emerged from
the Helsinki conference. The 1975 Helsinki Accords covered military
security, economic cooperation and human rights issues.
   ``We have to make (the Helsinki agreement) a binding
commitment,'' he said. ``We are all too tempted to speak about
institutions when it is more important to emphasize ... human
rights, freedom of expression, protection of minorities, the rule
of law.''
   Woerner, a former West German defense minister, said it was
vital for a unified Germany to be a full member of NATO and its
integrated military structure but with special arrangements to
cover Soviet security concerns.
   He said the Soviets had been offered a lot of tangible security
guarantees to drop their opposition to a unified Germany being a
member of NATO.
   ``There is no reason for them to feel threatened,'' Woerner
said. ``The Soviet Union needs partners and friends. Where else
better to find them than in a satisfied, peaceful, stable Europe?''
   He said developments the past year in the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe had reduced the threat of surprise conventional or
nuclear attack by the Soviets on NATO members.
   But he said the Western military alliance still was necessary
because of the risk of instability in the Soviet Union, which
remains the main military power on the Eurasian landmass.
   In reply to a question, Woerner said there was no need to extend
NATO's area of operations to include such areas as the Middle East,
although its members had cooperated there on an individual basis
during the Iran-Iraq war. He said there had been no request that
NATO consider playing a role in the Middle East.

   The Supreme Court ordered an end to political
patronage Thursday, ruling that federal, state and local government
jobs generally may not be awarded based on party affiliation.
   The justices, by a 5-4 vote, said constitutionally protected
rights are violated when people are denied government jobs,
promotions or transfers because of politically partisan reasons.
   The decision reinstates a lawsuit by three Illinois residents
against Gov. James Thompson and the state's other Republican
leaders. The suit says Thompson has made party allegiance a
requirement for 68,000 state jobs.
   While the ruling applies to all levels of government, city and
county governments may feel the biggest impact because most federal
and state government jobs are covered by civil service merit
systems that have made patronage obsolete.
   Only Puerto Rico filed a ``friend-of-the-court'' brief to defend
use of a patronage system.
   ``We're delighted,'' said Robert H. Chanin, a lawyer who
represented the National Education Association in urging the
justices to stamp out patronage.
   Chanin predicted little impact for federal jobs but added, ``It
will have an impact at the state level. There are probably 40
states that have some type of comprehensive merit system, but
perhaps as many as 10 states and Puerto Rico don't have such
systems or have slippage in their merit systems. They rely
primarily on what amounts to a patronage system.''
   ``Our general, gut reaction is that the most impact will be in
local governments _ among county and municipal employers,'' he
said. ``It could affect a great number of jobs.''
   The high court said partisanship may play a role in deciding who
gets a government job only when political affiliation is an
appropriate requirement, such as for high-level policy advisers.
   In a landmark 1976 ruling and a 1980 sequel, the high court
significantly weakened political patronage, sometimes called the
``spoils system.''
   Those rulings prohibited government employers from firing anyone
_ even some policy-making and confidential government workers _
solely because of their political affiliation unless party loyalty
is a requirement for effective performance.
   But those decisions dealt only with firings. Before Thursday,
the court never had said that partisanship could not play a role in
hiring, transfers and promotions as well.
   ``To the victor belongs the spoils that may be constitutionally
obtained,'' Justice William J. Brennan wrote for the court.
   ``The First Amendment prevents the government, except in the
most compelling circumstances, from wielding its power to interfere
with its employees' freedom to believe and associate, or to not
believe and not associate,'' he said.
   The Constitution's First Amendment protects freedom of speech
and association.
   Brennan was joined by Justices Byron R. White, Thurgood
Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia,
Anthony M. Kennedy and Sandra Day O'Connor dissented.
   Scalia wrote for the four, ``The court simply refuses to
acknowledge the link between patronage and party discipline, and
between that and party success.''
   ``It is self-evident,'' Scalia added, ``that eliminating
patronage will significantly undermine party discipline; and that
as party discipline wanes, so will the strength of the two-party
system.''
   The court also struck down government bosses' patronage powers
in laying off and rehiring public employees.
   A federal appeals court had upheld the Illinois patronage policy
in hiring, transfers and promotions but banned such considerations
in layoffs and rehirings. It said layoffs are too similar to
firings.
   In the Illinois case, two men and a woman who said their job
status suffered because they did not vote in Republican primaries
or give money to the party sued the governor, the state GOP and the
heads of several state agencies.
   Cynthia Rutan said she had repeatedly been denied promotions to
supervisory positions in the state Rehabilitative Services
Department because she did not support Republican candidates.
   Franklin Taylor, an equipment operator, said he had been denied
an Illinois Transportation Department transfer to another county
because party officials opposed the move.
   James Moore said the state Corrections Department has refused to
hire him since 1978 because he could not get the backing of key GOP
leaders.
   The three sued for more than $1 billion in damages. Their suit
also seeks to shift control of the state employment system to a
court-appointed federal receiver.
   Lawyers for Thompson and state GOP leaders had argued that
hiring political allies stimulates good government because the
employee is likely to appreciate the job and, in turn, serve the
public well.
   In other decisions, the court:
   _Ruled 5-4 in a case from Kansas and Missouri that states and
consumers may not sue over alleged price fixing by energy producers.
   _Ruled 6-3 in a Chicago case that evidence obtained by police in
a warrantless search of a home may be used in court if the officers
were admitted by someone they reasonably, but mistakenly, believed
had the authority to consent to the search.
   _Reinstated a former high school wrestling coach's 15-year-old
libel lawsuit against an Ohio newspaper.
   The court said the allegedly libelous statements could be
treated as assertions of fact, not opinion. But its 7-2 ruling did
not appear to reduce significantly the free-speech protections
courts traditionally have given to statements of opinion.

<TEXT>
   The Senate failed by two votes on Thursday to
override President Bush's veto of a bill to broaden the political
rights of millions of government workers.
   The 65-35 vote on the Hatch Act _ two short of the two-thirds
majority needed to override _ marked the 12th time in 12 tries that
Bush has prevailed over Congress in veto confrontations.
   Three Republicans who originally voted for the bill switched
sides to support Bush on the veto vote. All 55 Senate Democrats
voted to override the veto.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We are
pleased that that vote was sustained. We felt that it incorrectly
politicized the civil service.''
   The president vetoed the bill last Friday, saying it ``would
inevitably lead to repoliticizing the federal work force'' and
``destroy its essential political neutrality.''
   The House, with nearly half of its Republicans bolting the
administration, voted 327-93 on Wednesday to override Bush's veto.
   The legislation would have allowed 3 million federal and postal
workers to, on their own time, attend political conventions and
caucuses as delegates and to speak at rallies on behalf of
candidates.
   It also would have removed a ban on federal workers holding
offices in local, state or national political organizations or from
soliciting donations from co-workers for federal employee and
postal union political action committees.
   The workers would still have been prohibited from taking leaves
of absence to seek elected public office or soliciting campaign
contributions from the general public or on behalf of a specific
candidate.
   One sponsor, Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., said after the vote he
would try to extend the Hatch Act prohibitions on political
activity for federal workers to presidential appointees.
   Senate GOP leaders portrayed the bill during the debate on
override as an election-year bonanza for Democrats.
   Democrats ``want to get this bill passed before this election,''
said Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas. He said federal employee
and postal union political action committees funneled 88 percent of
their campaign contributions in the 1988 election to Democrats.
   ``The PAC heads of the Letter Carriers and others (unions) want
more power to raise more money to give to Democrats,'' Dole said.
``That's how it works around here: money is power.''
   Vincent Sombrotto, president of the 315,000-member Letter
Carriers union, said Bush's ``strong-arm tactics'' to get
Republicans to switch their votes ``places him in the same league
as the world's most oppressive dictators.''
   Thirteen Republicans had joined Senate Democrats in passing the
bill by a potentially veto-overriding 67-30 majority in May. Sens.
Alfonse D'Amato of New York, Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico and
Trent Lott of Mississippi switched Thursday to support Bush's veto.
   ``It would subject employees to subtle coercion to join
associations and to contribute, and I don't think most federal
employees want to be solicited by campaign organizations or PACs,''
said Domenici.
   The White House also gained the support of Republican Sens. Pete
Wilson of California and Kit Bond of Missouri. Both had missed the
vote in May, along with one Democrat.
   Democrats attributed the loss to White House pressure on
Republicans to maintain Bush's perfect record of overpowering
Congress in veto showdowns in his first 17 months in office.
   ``All of us regret that the merits of this struggle were
overshadowed by partisan appeals to preserve the president's
unbroken string of consecutive vetoes sustained by Congress,'' said
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
   Pryor said he planned to immediately seek to extend Hatch Act
prohibitions on campaigning to the hundreds of White House staff
employees and presidential political appointees now exempt from the
law.
   ``The government secretary who types letters should have at
least the same rights as the Secretary of Labor for whom she
works,'' Pryor said, noting Cabinet members frequently appear as
draws at political fund-raisers.
   ``That federal employee who cannot stuff envelopes on his own
volition can, in effect, now be required to write a partisan
political speech for his boss, the agency head,'' Pryor said.

<TEXT>
   Poor weather has sharply reduced this year's
production of both tart and sweet cherries, the Agriculture
Department said Thursday.
   Production of tart cherries is expected to be down 19 percent
from the 1989 harvest to an estimated 224 million pounds. That
would also be 5 percent less than the drought-damaged 1988 harvest.
   In Michigan, the largest producer, tart cherry production is
expected to be down 8 percent from last year and 3 percent below
the 1988 crop, the department said.
   ``Unseasonably warm weather in March got the crop off to a fast
start,'' the report said. ``However, temperatures dropped and were
below normal through much of April and May.''
   The cold, wet weather during bloom ``discouraged bee activity,
which caused poor pollination'' and a poor set of fruit, it said.
High winds took many blossoms off the trees.
   Major states were forecast at: Colorado, 1 million pounds, up
from 500,000 last year; Michigan, 175 million, down from 190
million; New York, 20 million, down from 31 million; Oregon, 7
million, down from 15 million; Pennsylvania, 3 million, down from 6
million; Utah, 14 million, down from 24 million; and Wisconsin, 3.8
million, down from 8.2 million.
   The crop of sweet cherries was forecast at 152,000 tons, down 22
percent from 1989 and 18 percent below the 1988 harvest.
   Department officials say sweet cherry production in the western
states is mostly quoted by the ton, while eastern practice favors

<HEAD>NRC to End Regulation of Some Low-Intensity Radioactive Waste
Disposal</HEAD>

   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has agreed
to end controls on the disposal of some low-level radioactive
wastes and materials at nuclear plants, hospitals and laboratories,
officials said Thursday.
   The revised policy, scheduled to be announced next week, is
likely to prompt a flood of requests from producers of such wastes
that they be allowed to dispose of them the same way as
conventional garbage.
   The commission has been grappling for years with a revision of
federal requirements for low-level radioactive wastes and
materials. Currently all such items must be given special handling
and may be discarded only in special waste disposasl facilities.
   But according to sources in environmental organizations and on
the commission staff who spoke on condition that their names not be
used, a majority of the five commissioners agreed in recent weeks
that wastes emitting radiation below a certain level should no
longer be regulated by the agency.
   The commissioners approved the revised policy by indicating
approval on the policy document, so-called notation voting, and
planned no formal vote in an open meeting, agency officials said.
   Joe Fouchard, a commission spokesman, confirmed that a majority
of the commission had approved the new policy and that details
would be announced next week. He said the policy would establish a
procedure to consider requests to exempt wastes from federal
controls, but provided no figures on what the cutoff would be.
   In early 1989, the commission proposed that any radioactive
wastes exposing a person to no more than 10 millirems per year
should be exempt from special treatment requirements. The electric
utility industry has proposed exempting materials emitting twice
that amount.
   A chest X-ray from modern apparatus could be expected to yield
an exposure of about 20 millirems. Typical exposures in the United
States from background radiation, including cosmic rays and
radioactive rocks, are about 200 millirems to 300 millirems per
year.
   Jonathan Becker, who has followed the issue for Public Citizen,
a Washington-based environmental and consumer group, said that the
revised policy would allow as much as a third of the low-level
radioactive wastes to be dumped into conventional landfills and
through normal sewer systems.
   ``These efforts to deregulate the disposal of nuclear wastes
illustrates the NRC's and the nuclear industry's inability to
dispose of their radioactive garbage in a safe, sensible manner,''
said Becker.
   He estimated that the nuclear industry, hospitals and
laboratories could to save $82 million a year because of reduced
disposal costs.
   The utility and nuclear industries have argued that radiation
from these wastes is too low to pose a health threat. ``The
associated risks, if any, are quite small compared to other actual
risks an individual faces every day,'' John J. Kerney, a member of
the health physics committee of the Edison Electric Institute,
wrote the commission.

<HEAD>Value of Arms Sales to Third World Down 50 Percent, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Major suppliers like the United States and the
Soviet Union have seen the value of their arms sales to Third World
clients drop more than 50 percent in recent years, according to a
new study by Congressional Research Service.
   The total value of arms deals with the Third World was $29.3
billion in 1989, down from $61.4 billion in the peak year 1982,
said the study by the congressional agency. A copy of the study was
made available to The Associated Press this week.
   Saudi Arabia and Iraq have been, by a wide margin, the top Third
World arms buyers from 1982 to 1989, accounting for 14.6 percent
and 14.1 percent, respectively, of the weapons transfers.
   The United States accounted for 26 percent of the arms sales
agreements with the Third World, but its total deals fell from $9.3
billion in 1988 to $7.7 billion last year.
   The U.S. figures only include government-to-government sales
agreements, excluding commercial sales for which the data is
incomplete, the report said. But this exclusion does not affect the
United States' ranking among other arms suppliers, it added.
   The value of U.S. commercial arms deliveries in fiscal 1989 fell
to $1.61 billion from $3.3 billion the previous fiscal year,
according to State Department figures.
   The Congressional Research Service study said France suffered a
massive decline in its arms sales agreements, which dropped from
$3.2 billion in 1988 to $300 million last year. West Germany, on
the other hand, increased its sales from $83 million in 1988 to
nearly $1.3 billion in 1989.
   The report attributed the decline to several factors. Third
World clients are still absorbing massive arms deliveries they
ordered in the 1970s and 1980s, and aren't buying expensive new
weapons. Their purchases in recent years have included a greater
proportion of spare parts and ammunition _ less costly than
aircraft, tanks or ships.
   Secondly, many Third World countries are burdened by heavy debt
and unwilling or unable to buy as many weapons as they did. Even
oil-rich nations have cut back on some arms purchases as oil prices
have dropped.
   Also, the end of the 8-year Iran-Iraq war in 1988 has reduced
orders from the two combatants, which accounted for a large part of
the massive increase in arms sales in the early and mid-1980s, the
study found.
   The value of Soviet arms deals, which accounted for 38.4 percent
of the weapons transfers to the Third World, fell from $14.7
billion in 1988 to $11.2 billion in 1989.
   In addition to a drop in demand, the decline in Soviet arms
sales could also reflect a Kremlin decision to cut back its support
for Third World clients who cannot pay in hard cash.
   Still, in 1989 the Soviets were the major supplier to eight of
the 10 top Third World arms recipients, the study said. They were:
Afghanistan, Angola, Vietnam, Syria, Iraq, Libya, Cuba and India.
   Iran's major supplier was China while Saudi Arabia's was Britain.
   Arms deals with Afghanistan more than tripled from 1982 to 1989,
to $8.6 billion. Angola and Vietnam increased their arms purchase
agreements 37 percent and 12 percent, respectively, in the same
period.
   Syria's purchases declined 56.4 percent, Iraq's were down 43.4
percent and Libya's fell 30.3 percent, the report said.
   India posted a massive increase in the value of arms deliveries,
up from $6.8 billion in the period 1982-85 to $13 billion in
1986-89, the report said.
   Its author, Richard Grimmett, noted that the decline of
East-West tensions and the resulting cuts in defense spending by
the world's major powers could increase competition among arms
manufacturers to sell to the Third World to compensate for lost
domestic markets.

   A flood triggered by a violent rainstorm
claimed at least 42 lives and left nine people missing in Turkey's
northern provinces, the semi-official Anatolia news agency said
Thursday.
   The seven-hour storm on Wednesday swept through the Black Sea
coastal provinces of Trabzon and Giresun and hit Gumushane
province, causing an estimated $150 million damage to homes,
businesses and cropland.
   Anatolia reported 38 died in Trabzon and nine were missing.
Floods also claimed three lives in Giresun and one in Gumushane.
   Public Works Minister Cengiz Altinkaya earlier told Anatolia
that officials feared the death toll would increase because rescue
teams had not yet reached several villages.
   Rescue teams on Thursday ferried 60 injured people from Akcaabat
township to Trabzon, a city on the Black Sea, Anatolia said.
   Fifteen bridges collapsed, five others were heavily damaged and
highways were blocked. Floods damaged communication and power lines
in the area.
   At least 200 houses were still under water in Trabzon,
newspapers reported. Government authorities seized privately owned
trucks in the area for transportation of relief aid.
   Trabzon Gov. Enver Hizlan said a landslide blocked a river,
diverting it into the Catak township. Authorities were trying to
reach Catak by air, he said.
   Turkish television showed cars filled with water and people
rowing boats in muddy waters covering the streets.
   Meteorologists said the rainfall was the worst in the region in
20 years. President Turgut Ozal and Premier Yildirim Akbulut flew
to Trabzon on Thursday to supervise rescue operations.
   The Turkish Red Crescent sent tents and food to Trabzon,
Anatolia said.

   The Agriculture Department announced plans
Thursday to prepare an environmental impact statement on the
control of Mediterranean fruit flies.
   It was a signal that USDA is digging in for the long haul in a
war against the medfly, a pest that poses a threat to the nation's
commercial fruit and vegetables.
   ``If established on the U.S. mainland, agricultural losses of
over $800 million annually could result,'' the announcement said.
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, said his agency is cooperating in
two medfly eradication programs in California and Florida.
   But he said aerial application of bait laced with the pesticide
malathion has met with considerable public demand for environmental
analysis, especially in California.
   Glosser said that medfly control is emergency in nature and must
be implemented quickly when an infestation is found. Thus, he said,
it is important that an environmental statement be prepared so it
will be in place for future medfly eradication programs.
   As a first step, the agency is asking for comments from the
public, government agencies and the private industry about issues
that should be addressed in the statement, he said. After review,
USDA will schedule public meetings to gather fuirther comment.
   The comments can be submitted by Aug. 21 _ an original and three
copies _ to Michael Werner, Deputy Director, Environmental
Documentation, Biotechnology, Biologics and Environmental
Protection, APHIS, USDA, Room 828, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest
Road, Hyattsville, Md. 20782. Refer to Docket No. 90-108.

<HEAD>Legislation Announced to Toughen Aviation Security</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senators on an anti-terrorism commission
announced legislation Thursday to appoint security managers at
high-risk airports and to require a system for notifying passengers
of terrorist threats.
   The measure goes beyond Bush administration proposals for
dealing with air terrorism. But sponsors said they expected
unanimous support for the actions originally proposed by the
presidential commission that looked into the bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103.
   Representatives of some relatives of victims of the December
1988 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, said they support the
legislation, which is to be introduced Friday. But a lawyer for
another relatives group said it falls far short of what is needed.
   The Lockerbie bombing, blamed on unidentified terrorists, killed
all 259 people aboard the London-New York flight and 11 people on
the ground.
   ``It's essential that we proceed,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg,
D-N.J., a member of the now-defunct presidential commission. ``The
terrorists are not giving up, and we can't either.''
   ``It can no longer be business as usual with the FAA (Federal
Aviation Administration) and the airlines,'' Lautenberg told a news
conference on the Capitol lawn.
   Lautenberg and fellow commission members Sen. Alfonse D'Amato,
R-N.Y., and Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn., all said they expected
strong bipartisan support and Bush administration backing for the
bill, which is subject to change as it moves through Congress.
   The Senate bill, to be matched by a similar House measure next
week, would give special FAA managers responsibility for security
at airports where terrorists are considered likely to operate.
   It also would require the FAA and the FBI to assess the security
threat to domestic airports and set up security screening of mail
and cargo.
   The bill would prohibit selective notification of government
employees when there is a threat and would order that guidelines be
set up for notifying the public when there is a credible threat
against a flight.
   George Williams, representing one group of victims' relatives,
told the news conference the bill would cover most relatives'
concerns and he added, ``God speed this legislation.''
   Michael Lemov, a Washington lawyer representing a rival
relatives group, told reporters before the news conference that the
legislation fails to create a public oversight board recommended by
family members and sets up too many hurdles before the public can
be notified of a threat.
   Lemov said Congress should create a separate agency to handle
the aviation terrorist threat.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner and FAA Administrator
James Busey announced several initial steps to meet commission
recommendations last week, including the appointment of top
officials in the department to oversee aviation security.
   Skinner, at a speech Thursday, said he expects to submit to
President Bush a full response to the commission report in July.

   The Senate Armed Services Committee approved
on Thursday three of President Bush's nominees to top defense
posts, including the choice of Lt. Gen. Carl W. Stiner to head the
Special Operations Command.
   By a vote of 12-0, the panel sent to the full Senate the
nomination of Gen. Michael J. Dugan as Air Force chief of staff,
Adm. Frank B. Kelso as chief of Naval Operations and the selection
of Stiner.
   The Senate is expected to approve the choices without dissent.
   The nomination of Stiner got caught up in a debate between
Congress and the Defense Department over the role of Special
Operations in intelligence gathering and civilian oversight of the
elite unit formed in April 1987.
   ``It may well be that this senator feels that that issue is
going to have to be resolved prior to such time as this committee
completes the work on your nomination,'' Sen. John Warner of
Virginia, ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee, said
last month at Stiner's confirmation hearing.
   Warner and Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the panel, also
expressed concerns about a proposal calling for elimination of
civilian oversight of intelligence activities by Special Operations.
   Gen. James J. Lindsay, commander of the Special Operations
Command, made the proposal in a memorandum to Gen. Colin Powell,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   In a telephone interview Thursday, Warner said he raised his
concerns over the participation of the head of Special Operations
in intelligence gathering and the issue has ``now been resolved.''
   ``I spent a considerable amount of time analyzing this
nomination not only in terms of the individual, but the general
oversight of this important and vital segment of security forces,''
Warner said.
   The Republican senator also sought _ and received _ a letter
from Powell describing the reasons for Stiner's nomination.
   In the end, Warner joined with other lawmakers in voting for the
nomination.

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses Case Against CIA Skyjacker</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Thursday dismissed a 26-year-old
skyjacking case against a man who argued the CIA ordered him to
hijack the plane to Cuba as a cover to infiltrate that nation's
intelligence service.
   Reinaldo Lopez-Lima ended up spending 24 years in Cuban prisons
before he was released and returned to the United States in 1987.
   For two years he lived quietly outside Washington, D.C., ignored
by federal prosecutors, but then was arrested on a 1969 indictment
in the case.
   U.S. District Judge Kenneth Ryskamp ruled the government failed
to give the 50-year-old defendant a speedy trial.
   ``I believe the government's conduct in this case can only be
described as draconian,'' Ryskamp said. ``It's puzzling to the
court why it is pursuing this.''
   The judge noted Cuba offered to return Lopez-Lima in 1972, but
the U.S. government refused.
   The defendant said he was thrilled to end his long ordeal but
worried the Immigration and Naturalization Service will move to
deport him.
   ``I'm very happy. I'm going to celebrate tonight,'' he said
after the ruling. ``The only thing I'm afraid of now is that the
INS will take some action against me.''
   Diane Cossin, spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office, said
prosecutors will decide in a few weeks if they will appeal the
dismissal.
   According to the indictment, Lopez-Lima and Enrique Castillo
Hernandez held a gun to pilot Richard Lee Wright and forced him to
fly to Cuba from Key West in a small plane in February 1964.
   The plan, Lopez-Lima said, was to convince Castro's government
that he and Hernandez were CIA defectors. Once inside Cuba, they
were supposed to assist anti-Castro forces.
   Lopez-Lima and Hernandez landed in Cuba but failed to win the
Cubans' confidence and wound up in jail. Lopez-Lima stayed in
Castro's prisons and work camps for 24 years; Hernandez was
imprisoned for 16 years before returning to Miami in the 1980
Mariel boatlift. He was later slain.
   Lopez-Lima won a major victory in a pretrial hearing two weeks
ago when Ryskamp allowed him to introduce evidence of his CIA
connections and the agency's authorization for operations that
included hijackings.
   The judge cited a 1955 national security order that gave broad
powers to the CIA, including the right to break U.S. laws. That
order was repealed in 1981.
   Ryskamp also said Lopez-Lima made a good case of why he should
be allowed to testify that he was working for the CIA when he
hijacked the plane.
   According to CIA records, the people named in Lopez-Lima's court
documents as having sanctioned the hijacking worked for the CIA at
the time, Ryskamp said.
   The government conceded Lopez-Lima's CIA contacts were valid but
said he wasn't instructed to hijack a plane to Cuba because his
contacts had no authority to give such an order.

   World business leaders told President Bush on
Thursday that the main aim of next month's seven-country summit
should be to ensure a successful end in December to four years of
global negotiations on trade.
   The long-term talks among 100 countries are known as the
``Uruguay round.'' They are stalled by a deadlock between the
United States and the 12 governments of the European Economic
Community over cutting subsidies on farm products. These subsidies
cost taxpayers and consumers in the United States and other
industrial countries an estimated $245 billion a year.
   ``I think he (Bush) accepts that the deadlock should be broken
in Houston,'' said Joseph E. Connor, chairman of Price Waterhouse
World Firm and a leader of the group that went to the White House.
   ``At least that was the message we were trying to convey to him,
that if it is not broken, then there is hardly time for the
(governments) ... to conclude the round in December, and we do
believe the round must conclude in December.''
   Bush meets in Houston, Texas, July 9 to 11, with the leaders of
Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Canada and the
Europoean group.
   The Reagan and Bush administrations have insisted on a pledge
eventually to get rid of farm subsidies that directly affect world
trade. The Europeans want a deal on all kinds of support for farm
products.
   The negotiations also aim at accords on other important issues,
including the trade in services, from air travel to zoo keeping.
Services now provide more jobs in the United States and other
advanced countries than traditional manufacturing.
   ``Governments must be under no illusion that, without
substantial and substantive liberalization of market access and
reform of the multilateral rules which govern world trade and their
extension to new areas, business will simply not consider the
Uruguay round a success,'' said the statement given to Bush.

   Political observers question whether
the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on patronage hiring in Illinois
would succeed in uprooting the old rule: To the victor belong the
spoils.
   The court cleared the way for trial of a federal lawsuit filed
on behalf of three Illinois residents who claimed that a patronage
system run by Republican Gov. James R. Thompson's administration
had prevented them from being hired, promoted or transferred in
state jobs.
   In the past, Thompson has acknowledged giving preference to
Republicans in state hiring when choosing among equally qualified
candidates; he maintains the practice ensures that his policies are
carried out.
   After Thursday's ruling, he denied the lawsuit's claims and
declared that the matter will have to be settled in court.
   ``I think this will strike a severe blow at whatever is left of
political parties in America,'' he said.
   Mary Lee Leahy, a lawyer and Democratic Party activist who filed
the lawsuit, said the ruling would free state employees from
concerns about how their political activity _ or lack of it _ would
affect their jobs.
   ``The patronage system just isn't going to be, certainly not as
we know it,'' she said. ``The average state employee is going to be
free to do or not do what he or she wishes politically.''
   But other observers were skeptical about the ruling's potential
impact.
   Paul Green, a professor of political science at Governors State
University in University Park, said a smart politician ``will
always find a way to get around any procedure that the court or the
Legislature will place upon him.''
   He added: ``This will just make it a little more difficult to
put your people in.''
   Officials in other states pooh-poohed the possible effects, too.
   Andrew Crane, executive director of the Massachusetts Ethics
Commission, said: ``There is not a consensus about whether
patronage is appropriate or not. ... Many people have said it's
inappropriate. Many other people say what is wrong with hiring
political supporters if they are qualified for the job.''
   Illinois labor officials noted that the union contract covering
state employees bars consideration of political factors in
promotion, but enforcement depends on employees' willingness to
blow the whistle on violations.
   ``Unless there is someone there to protest, it's still going to
continue to go on,'' said Henry Bayer, associate director of
Illinois Council 31 of the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees.
   A total of 68,268 employees are under the governor's control,
according to the state comptroller's office. Both parties in
Illinois have a long track record of political hiring.
   ``When you go back to the first governors of Illinois, the first
mayors, patronage has played an important role,'' Green said.
   In Cook County, which includes Chicago, a consent decree to bar
politically motivated hiring has been in effect since 1979. The ban
is known as the ``Shakman decree,'' after Chicago lawyer Michael
Shakman, who challenged the patronage system operated under the
late Chicago mayor, Richard J. Daley.
   But political observers say the Shakman decree effectively
``locked in'' many of the patronage workers who were installed in
government jobs by the county's Democratic organization before the
decree took effect.
   ``To some extent, you might have a situation where people would
be protected in their current jobs, and that might hurt a future
administration since Thompson has had the chance to make these
appointments for 14 years,'' said David Everson, a political
scientist at Sangamon State University in Springfield.

<HEAD>Former Bingo Lobbyist Says He Gave Cash To Several State Lawmakers</HEAD>

   A former bingo lobbyist testified
Thursday that he gave $32,000 in cash to Gov. Ned McWherter's 1986
campaign and thousands more to state legislators debating changes
in the law.
   James V. Long, testifying in the federal conspiracy and gambling
trial of Democratic state Rep. Tommy Burnett and two co-defendants,
said he didn't disclose the gifts, as required by state law.
   Long, testifying under a plea bargain, was the government's
first major witness.
   McWherter, who was speaker of the Tennessee House when the gifts
were allegedly made, was vacationing in Florida and unavailable to
comment, said spokesman Ken Renner.
   Renner said a quick review of the Democratic governor's
financial disclosure records showed Long contributed less than
$4,000 to McWherter's gubernatorial campaign. However, the
spokesman didn't rule out the possibility Long may have concealed
some donations.
   Burnett, 47, is charged in a 10-count indictment with illegal
gambling, conspiracy, mail fraud and perjury. His co-defendants,
Knoxville bingo operator Virginia Hurst and Columbia businessman
E.E. Shutt, are accused of illegal gambling and conspiracy.
   Long said the cash gifts ranged from $6,000 to Democratic state
Sen. Jim Lewis to $100 to $200 to Democratic Lt. Gov. John Wilder.
   Lewis said he received contributions from Long, but said all
came through normal, proper channels.
   ``Jim Long said he gave me $6,000? No,'' Lewis said. ``He gave
me $400 at a fund-raiser. I was selling $100 tickets, and he bought
four.
   ``Jim Long did buy my supper occasionally and Jim Long had given
me at one time maybe $500, aside from the $400, at another
fund-raiser. But that's the most he gave me,'' Lewis said.
   Long, who was also named in the indictment, has pleaded guilty
to setting up and running illegal bingo games.
   ``I knew the money I was making was illegal. All the money I was
spending was illegal, and I didn't report it,'' said Long. He
claimed that in 1986 he made $150,000 to $250,000 from bingo.
   Long told defense attorney Bob Lynch under cross-examinationhe
was just following unwritten ground rules for lobbyists when he
gave the legislators cash.
   ``I didn't change the rules when I came to Nashville, I just
followed along,'' he said.
   Long was the fourth prosecution witness in the case.
   Long pleaded guilty earlier this year in U.S. District Court in
Nashville and Memphis and in a state court in Memphis for his role
in setting up and operating illegal bingo games.
   He testified Thursday that his plea bargain calls for him to
receive no more than five years in prison on each charge, with most
of the sentences to run simultaneously.

   Quick treatment with the drug AZT in the
earliest stages of AIDS infection can significantly slow the lethal
disease, according to research presented Thursday at the Sixth
International Conference on AIDS.
   The study appears to provide the strongest evidence yet that
early intervention can stall the emergence of AIDS in people
infected with HIV, the AIDS virus.
   ``We have to come to the conclusion that the greatest advantage
has to accrue with early intervention,'' said Dr. Margaret Fischl.
``It has to occur as early as possible in HIV infection.''
   Fischl, a researcher at the University of Miami, pioneered the
use of AZT in people who already have AIDS. However, most infected
people are still outwardly healthy. So Fischl and other teams
around the country have been exploring the risks and advantages of
giving the medicine before AIDS infection reaches its final stages.
   The conference opened Wednesday amid angry protests by thousands
of demonstrators frustrated over the slow pace of progress in
controlling the disease.
   The demonstrations continued Thursday as several hundred
protesters marched by government offices in San Francisco's Civic
Center. About 50 protesters were arrested after they blocked a busy
intersection.
   Another group rushed into the lobby of a building housing the
state insurance commissioner, but left a short time later without
incident.
   Fischl's recommendation is likely to be controversial. During
the past year, some researchers have begun to question whether AZT,
the only approved AIDS drug, should be reserved for use during the
later stages of the disease.
   The medicine interferes with the reproduction of HIV. When given
to people with AIDS, the drug loses its punch within two or three
years as the virus becomes resistant to it.
   Some doctors believe that if given early in the disease, AZT
will be powerless to slow the disease once AIDS develops.
   Fischl's conclusions were based on patients who were infected
with HIV but had not developed any major symptoms of AIDS. Two
hundred received placebos for a year and then switched to AZT for
eight more months. Two hundred fifty-one others took AZT for the
entire period.
   She found that significantly fewer progressed to AIDS if they
got the drug without delay.
   Several other reports presented Thursday focused on how the
infection is transmitted.
   Dr. Nancy Padian of the University of California, San Francisco,
found that women who have sex with AIDS-infected men are 12 times
more likely to catch the virus than are men who are sexually
exposed to infected women.
   Her research, based on 58 male sex partners of infected women
and 269 women partners of infected men, supports the widely held
belief that the virus spreads more ``efficiently'' from men to
women than from women to men.
   During her study, only one man caught the virus from his female
sex partner. This couple reported having intercourse without
condoms more than 1,000 times over seven years.
   Among other research presented:
   _Dr. Rachel Royce of the University of California, Berkeley,
reported circumstantial evidence that cigarette smoking may speed
up the development of AIDS in people who are already infected with
HIV.
   The study, based on 1,000 infected gay men, found that smokers
were almost twice as likely as non-smokers to develop AIDS or die
over 4{ years.
   _HIV-infected mothers run a high risk of passing the virus to
their babies before birth. Now, a Soviet study has found that
infected babies can also pose a hazard to their uninfected mothers.
   Dr. Irina Kuznetsova from the Central Research Institute of
Epidemiology in Moscow reported on babies who got infected from
contaminated needles in hospitals. They found that 11 of 18 women
who breast-fed their infected babies contracted the virus. They
attributed this to cracks in the mothers' nipples that allowed the
virus to enter their bodies.
   _Dr. Tom Peterman from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
reported that bisexuality appears to be an important source of AIDS
infection in the Army.
   He and Army researchers reviewed 43 soldiers who developed AIDS
infections. Twenty-one admitted to high-risk activities, and of
these 18 said they had sexual contact with other men. Most of these
men had sex with women, as well.

   The State Department, in a follow-up to
President Bush's suspension of the U.S. dialogue with the Palestine
Liberation Organization, Thursday urged Americans traveling to the
Middle East and elsewhere to exercise ``extra caution.''
   Deputy spokesman Richard Boucher attributed the advisory to
rising tensions in the area but said he was not aware of any
specific threats.
   He said it was possible that the tension might increase as a
result of Bush's announcement but he stressed that there were other
reasons for the warning as well.
   He recalled that on May 31, the day after the abortive attack by
the Palestine Liberation Front on beaches near Tel Aviv, the
Department had said it was concerned about tensions in the region
and that terrorists had threatened to attack American citizens or
interests.

   A minister, eulogizing one of eight
people slain in gunman's rampage at an auto loan office, asked
mourners Thursday why bad things happen to good people.
   ``Tragedy is not God's will,'' the Rev. Dennis Bratton said,
answering his own question at the funeral of Denise Sapp Highfill,
the 36-year-old wife of a police detective. ``God is just as
outraged by this as we are.''
   There were few other answers. Police said they still don't know
why James Edward Pough, 42, burst into the General Motors
Acceptance Corp. office Monday and began firing. He also wounded
five others before killing himself.
   Pough, who had a history of criminal violence and whose car had
been repossessed by GMAC, still owed the finance company $6,394 on
it, The Florida Times-Union reported Thursday.
   A state lawmaker said a bill would be drafted plugging the
loophole in Florida law that allowed Pough to legally buy firearms
despite his criminal record. The law's weakness ``can't be
tolerated,'' said Rep. Ron Silver.
   Although Pough pleaded guilty to aggravated assault in 1971 in
the shooting death of another man, adjudication was withheld,
allowing him to legally purchase weapons after serving his
five-year probation.
   A motorcade of 200 cars, including about 25 police vehicles,
left the church headed Mrs. Highfill's burial at Oaklawn Cemetery.
The funeral was one of six held Thursday.
   Other services were held for slain GMAC employee Lee Simonton,
33; Janice David, 40; Barbara Duckwall Holland, 45; Cynthia Perry,
30; and Julia White Burgess, 42. Services will be Friday for Sharon
Louise Hall, 45 and arrangements are pending for Drew Woods, 38.
   Mayor Tommy Hazouri said a citywide memorial service will be
held Friday at the Jacksonville Convention Center and GMAC is
planning a service Saturday.
   The five wounded in the shooting are still hospitalized, but
doctors expect them to survive.
   GMAC will close its Baymeadows office where the seven workers
and a customer were slain. It plans to move into temporary quarters
and open a permanent office in Jacksonville in six to nine months,
officials said.
   The Times-Union quoted sources saying GMAC notified Pough of the
amount he owed but never pursued collection. ``It was a business
decision, and beyond that, I'm not discussing it,'' said Patricia
Molloy, a GM spokeswoman.
   Pough bought a 1988 Pontiac Grand Am for about $9,700 in
September 1988 and financed it through GMAC, but state records do
not indicate the finance charges. GMAC has a policy against
releasing company records.
   In January, Pough voluntarily surrendered the car because he was
having trouble making the payments.
   When GMAC took the car back, it was sold Feb. 22 to a
Gainesville car dealer, the newspapers said. GMAC notified Pough in
March that he still owned $6,394.

   Perrier is back. But whether the French bottled
water will recapture its once sparkling position in the U.S. market
isn't clear.
   Hotels and restaurants, the staple of Perrier's sales, stopped
carrying the water when benzene contamination forced the company to
recall it worldwide on Feb. 9. Many haven't taken it back.
   ``None of our customers want it. I think the recall really
frightened people,'' said Mark Schachern, manager of the Washington
Square Bar and Grill in San Francisco.
   Some distributors and industry officials say Perrier has
received a tepid reception from hotels and restaurants since it was
reintroduced in the United States in late April. The return
included a $25 million advertising campaign and such publicity
events as a give-away of cases of the familiar pear-shaped bottles
in New York's Central Park and Rockefeller Center.
   ``There's still a certain amount of reluctance on the part of
many hotels and restaurants,'' said Hellen Berry of Beverage
Marketing Corp., an industry trade group. ``Many customers are
happy with what's been substituted.''
   Perrier Group of America Inc., based in Greenwich, Conn., said
it had no concrete sales figures for the year. But company
spokeswoman Jane Lazgin said, ``We are right on target for where we
should be at this time.''
   Lazgin admitted that the response from restaurants since the
reintroduction hasn't been what the company hoped it would be.
   ``We are working hard to regain our accounts. But it won't be a
quick fix. We have a lot of work to do,'' she said.
   Experts say Perrier probably has done better at recapturing lost
shelf space in supermarkets because it was able to offer its other
brands _ Poland Spring, Calistoga and Arrowhead _ as alternatives.
   Perrier distributors agree, but admit that many customers still
are reluctant to take Perrier back.
   The Pepsi-Cola Buffalo Bottling Corp. in Buffalo, N.Y., a
Perrier distributor, is sending its salespeople to supermarkets it
once served in the Buffalo area to help boost customer confidence.
   ``We feel we owe it to them to meet face to face and explain
that it's O.K. to take Perrier back,'' said manager Scott Pastor.
   Pastor said his Perrier customers now number less than the 800
restaurants and supermarkets he had before the recall, but he
declined to be specific or release recent sales figures.
   Source Perrier SA recalled its water from worldwide distribution
after tests showed traces of naturally occurring benzene, a
cancer-causing chemical, in its product in several countries. The
contamination stemmed from improper filtration of the water, the
company said.
   Its absence from the American market was a blow to Perrier,
which built the U.S. sparkling mineral water market nearly from
scratch in the 1970s, said Berry of the industry group.
   In 1989, Perrier posted U.S. sales of $102 million. That
accounted for 4.4 percent of the industry's $2.3 billion in U.S.
sales.
   The company has put the cost of the recall at $78 million.
   Berry said competitors took advantage of Perrier's absence to
increase their own market share.
   ``We're in places we never were before,'' said Sandy Klinzman, a
spokeswoman for Evian Waters of France, which also is the parent
company of Saratoga Bottled Mineral Water. Klinzman claimed sales
of Evian and Saratoga water increased dramatically this year, but
declined to release any figures.
   ``Anytime you have a major player like Perrier gone everyone
benefits,'' she said.
   There are about 450 water bottling plants in the United States
producing more than 600 different labels of drinking water, natural
water and spring water, according to Bevmark Inc., a Los
Angeles-based consulting firm. In addition, there are about 50
brands of imported waters, Bevmark said.

   Summery weather prevailed for much of the nation Thursday, the
first day of summer, but thunderstorms and rainshowers were
scattered from the Southeast to the southern Plains and across
upper Midwest.
   Strong, slow-moving thunderstorms threatened local flooding in
parts of south-central Tennessee, northern Alabama, northwest
Arkansas and northeast Oklahoma.
   In Alabama, lightning strikes knocked out electric power in
Blountsville and Brooksville, and lightning destroyed a house and
caused many other fires near Snead.
   At noon, rainshowers and thunderstorms were scattered from the
northwest two thirds of New York, across northern Maine, southwest
Pennsylvania, the southern and central Florida Peninsula, from
southeast Tennessee across northwest Georgia and Alabama, along the
Louisiana coast and the central Texas Gulf Coast.
   Rainshowers and thunderstorms also reached from west central
Mississippi across the northwest third of Arkansas into eastern
Oklahoma, as well as southeast Colorado, northeast New Mexico and
the Texas Panhandle, the Oklahoma Panhandle and northwest Oklahoma,
western Kansas, much of Nebraska, Iowa, southern South Dakota and
eastern Wyoming.
   Rainshowers and thunderstorms reached from northern Minnesota
across northwest Wisconsin and upper Michigan, as well as along the
central coast of Oregon.
   Heavier rainfall during the 6 hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included more than 2 inches at Fayetteville, Ark., and two-thirds
of an inch at Columbus, Miss.
   High temperature records for the day were set in Augusta, Ga.,
where the 102-degree high broke the record of 102 set in 1924, and
in Charleston, S.C., where the 100-degree reading beat the 1988
mark by three degrees.
   The low temperature for the Lower 48 state Thursday morning was
33 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 50
degrees at Casper, Wyo., to 110 degrees at Palm Springs, Calif.

   Bush administration officials and
congressional leaders ended budget negotiations for the week
Thursday with both sides saying they had accomplished little.
   ``What I'm fearful of is we're in some kind of stalemate,'' said
Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, one of the Republican
negotiators, as the sixth week of the closed-door sessions ended.
   The $50.7 billion deficit-reduction package that the White House
presented on Wednesday, the first proposal of the talks, went over
badly with Democrats.
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., called it
``deficient.'' House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta,
D-Calif., called it ``inadequate.''
   And it prompted Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., of the Senate
Budget Committee to distribute an analysis that called it ``a
fiscal morning of the living dead.'' That was a reference to the
plan's similarity to the rejected budget President Bush presented
in January.
   ``We're in a negotiation,'' White House budget chief Richard
Darman said of the Democratic criticisms. ``Everybody understands
that.''
   During two bargaining sessions Thursday, Democrats attacked the
latest White House plan and administration officials defended it.
But Democrats did not offer a proposal of their own, and some of
them insisted that the administration come back with a more serious
proposal.
   ``The ball lies semi-deflated in the president's court,'' said
Sasser.
   The administration plan claims $444 billion in savings over five
years. It relies heavily on cuts in benefit programs like Medicare.
Democrats say more savings are needed, and argue that deeper
reductions in defense are needed.
   The talks are scheduled to resume Monday.

   Poland named Kazimierz Dziewanowski, a
longtime opposition journalist as its new ambassador to the United
States on Wednesday, the state news agency reported.
   Dziewanowski, 59, was assistant editor of Soldarity's weekly
newspaper, Tygodnik Solidarnosc, in 1981 when the weekly was edited
by Tadeusz Mazowiecki, now Poland's prime minister.
   The ambassador-designate also participated in talks in 1989 that
led to the legalization of Solidarity and the holding of largely
democratic elections in Poland.
   President Wojciech Jaruzelski nominated Dziewanowski to the
post, according to the PAP news agency.
   Dziewanowski succeeds Jan Kinast, who has served as ambassador
to Washington since March 1988 when Poland and the United States
restored full diplomatic relations following a five-year
interruption.
   Dziewanowski said in an interview Wednesday evening that he
expects to take up his post sometime in mid-July.
   ``I think it is very important to try to change the image of our
embassy in Washington because it was not a very good image. I am
not for making any accusations, but it was so, and now we would
like to change it,'' he said.
   He said he planned to work in two directions to improve Poland's
image.
   ``The first is American public opinion, Congress, mass media,
intellectual circles and so on; and the second is (with) Americans
of Polish descent.
   ``We would like very much to get into close contact with them
and to help to improve things which were done very badly in the
last 40 years. This is very important,'' he said.
   Dziewanowski joked that he was a little daunted by the
assignment.
   ``If you would like to know the truth, I would say that between
the Vistula and the Potomac you could hardly find another man as
frightened as I am now. This is a very important job.''
   But he added that along with other new appointees to the embassy
staff, he expected to be able to improve Poland's image.

   The Justice Department said Thursday it will

camp during World War II to remain in the United States because of
his rapidly declining health.
   On Wednesday, an immigration judge ordered the deportation of
Albert Ensin, 68, of Stoughton, Mass., after he admitted at a
hearing that he was an SS guard at Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration
camp between 1941 and 1943. But the Justice Department said it will
allow Ensin, who suffered a series of debilitating strokes, to stay.
   At the deportation hearing before a U.S. Immigration Court judge
in Boston, Ensin also admitted that he participated in the mass
persecution of concentration camp inmates.
   A native of Lithuania, Ensin entered the United States in 1975
as a refugee but never became a U.S. citizen.

   An earthquake shattered northern Iran
early Thursday, killing at least 25,000 people and injuring tens of
thousands, Iranian officials announced.
   The quake shortly after midnight Thursday demolished scores of
villages and towns and buried thousands of people in their homes.
The Iranian mission to the United Nations, which released the
casualty toll, said it would likely rise further as rescuers
reached more remote areas.
   The earthquake was at least as bad as the quake registering 7.7
on the Richter scale that struck Iran on Sept. 16, 1978, killing at
least 25,000 people.
   The temblor measured 7.3 on the Richter scale of ground motion,
the Geophysics Center at Tehran University said. The U.S.
Geological Survey, however, measured it at 7.7.
   At least a dozen aftershocks shook the region within two hours
after the quake. The earthquake struck at 12:30 a.m. and was
centered 125 miles northwest of Tehran, near the Caspian Sea, the
official news agency IRNA reported.
   It shook buildings and shattered windows in Tehran, but
apparently caused no deaths in the capital. In the neighboring
Soviet republic of Azerbaijan, the temblor slightly damaged some
older buildings in Baku but caused no casualties, the Soviet news
agency Tass said.
   The Iranian Ambassador to the United Nations, Kamal Kharrazi,
told Cable News Network that Iran badly needs medical equipment,
blood, blankets and medicine. ``I understand that international
organizations are trying their best to bring some of this equipment
and medicine.''
   Scenes shown on state television and monitored in Cyprus showed
young men frantically clawing at debris from flattened concrete
buildings in Rasht, 175 miles northwest of Tehran with a population
of 189,000 people.
   Occasionally, they carried away someone on a stretcher.
Bulldozers and cranes lifted away larger pieces of debris.
   Earlier Thursday, a statement by the Iranian Cabinet said the
``sad, painful and horrible tragedy has so far claimed 10,000 lives
and left thousands of others wounded.''
   The announcement carried by the Islamic Republic News Agency
placed all government organizations ``on full alert,'' and ordered
an air bridge set up between Tehran and the stricken areas to
evacuate survivors.
   Landslides blocked rescuers on the ground, and bad weather
hindered helicopters trying to airlift supplies and victims, IRNA
said.
   Many people remained buried in the debris, it said, and several
hundred Revolutionary Guards were flown from Tehran after nighfall
to join rescue teams.
   Iran's spiritual leader, Ali Khamenei, called the disaster a
``divine test'' and urged the bereaved residents of the stricken
provinces ``to pass this test with pride through patience and
cooperation.''
   More than half of those killed and injured Thursday were in
Zanjan province. The second-hardest hit was Gilan province, IRNA
said in dispatches monitored in Cyprus.
   The victims included at least 1,000 people killed in one village
in Zanjan province, Ab-Dar, the news agency said. Also killed were
768 people in Qazvin just 80 miles northwest of Tehran.
   In Zanjan alone, 73 villages and towns were affected, IRNA said.
Many were leveled.
   IRNA said the quake triggered landslides that blocked main roads.
   Dozens of rescue vehicles, including trucks carrying food
supplies and ambulances, were stuck on the roads, it said.
   Telephone lines and electricity and water supplies were cut in
Zanjan and Gilan, which have a combined population of 2.7 million.
Communications with Tehran from the outside world also were
difficult.
   In Ab-Dar, the televison showed mountains of rubble, which a
speaker said were all that was left of apartment buildings. They
appeared to have been shaken off their foundations, collapsing like
a deck of cards.
   The camera zoomed in on a stuffed rabbit and a shoe lying in a
street carpeted with dust.
   Women in black chadors flanked by weeping children camped out in
public squares, afraid to return to their homes in case of
aftershocks.
   A dam south of Rasht burst, flooding the surrounding area, IRNA
said.
   Hospitals appealed for blood donations and helicopters and
transport planes delivered thousands of tents and blankets. They
also carried rice, tea, sugar, cheeses and canned food to the area,
IRNA said.
   Three U.S.-made C-130 transport planes shuttled between Tehran
and Rasht to carry the injured to hospitals in the capital, it
said. State-run Iran Air ordered special flights to carry the
injured.
   Khamenei and President Hashemi Rafsanjani flew to the area to
supervise relief operations. Rafsanjani declared three days of
mourning and ordered all state agencies to be ready to provide help.
   The United States offered humanitarian assistance to Iran and
President Bush sent a message of condolence to Rafsanjani. The
message was delivered to Iran by another, unidentified country
since the United States does not have diplomatic relations with
Tehran.
   The region is prone to earthquakes. A quake registering 6.9 on
the Richter scale struck nearby Soviet Armenia on Dec. 7, 1988,
killing 25,000 people.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. A reading of 7 on the scale indicates a major
earthquake capable of widespread heavy damage. Eight is a ``great''
quake, capable of tremendous damage.

   A man faces an extradition hearing after
being charged with kidnapping in the 1987 disappearance of a
9-year-old girl whose mother forced a grand jury investigation.
   David C. Phelps, 26, a longtime suspect in the case, was
arrested in Perry, Iowa, on Wednesday night, special prosecutor
James D. Smith said Thursday. Phelps, a former Norfolk resident,
was indicted Tuesday.
   ``As far as I'm concerned the grand jury was somewhat
conservative but I understand why,'' said Joyce Cutshall, whose
daughter Jill remains missing.
   ``But it means there will be a trial and everything that
happened to Jill should and will, I feel, be told in the end of
it.''
   Jill disappeared Aug. 13, 1987, from this northeast Nebraska
prairie city about 110 miles northwest of Omaha. She had been
waiting alone on the steps of her baby sitter's home in Norfolk.
   Her clothes were found in a wildlife area three months later.
   The case attracted national attention, including a report on
CBS's ``60 Minutes.'' Thousands of fliers with Jill's picture have
been distributed throughout North America.
   Frustrated by what she considered lax police work, Ms. Cutshall
began a petition drive and forced a grand jury investigation.
   Under state law, a court is required to convene a grand jury if
presented with petitions from at least 10 percent of the county's
voters who participated in the last gubernatorial election. Ms.
Cutshall needed 1,024 signatures and collected 1,471.
   A Madison County grand jury began work April 30.
   Phelps was being held in the Dallas County Jail in Adel, pending
an extradition hearing, which may be held as soon as Monday, Smith
said. Bond was set at $100,000.
   In an interview Thursday, Ms. Cutshall said she is ``99 percent
sure'' that her daughter is dead, but hoped the indictment and a
trial would lead to further investigation into her daughter's
whereabouts.
   ``It's a daily thought for me. I know Jill is very, very near to
me _ within a 20-mile radius of me _ and knowing that there are
people who know where she is at and I don't is becoming very, very
frustrating,'' she said.
   Ms. Cutshall said has no doubt that her petition effort was
worth it.
   ``In retrospect, a couple of months ago, I looked back at what I
did and I was kind of surprised ... I was real surprised,'' she
said.
   She said it was the only thing she could do for her missing
daughter.
   ``That was my last avenue, my last road to take,'' she said.
   A private investigator who has worked on the case for two years
promised to continue to search for Jill.
   ``This means the fight has just now really started,'' said Roy
Stephens, director of investigations for the Omaha-based Missing
Youth Foundation.

   A truckload of dog biscuits from California
arrived Wednesday at the Statehouse in a protest of what critics
call substandard commercial dog kennels in Kansas.
   More than 100 protesters gathered at the Capitol steps as the
yellow rented truck, with a sign reading ``No More Puppy Mills'' on
the side, pulled up.
   ``We have brought a message to the governor and state attorney
general of Kansas,'' said organizer Ellen Katzman of Sonora,
Calif., as she opened the back of the truck. Each box of dog
biscuits in the truck was stamped with ``No More Puppy Mills.''
   ``We will not tolerate any more sick dogs coming into California
pet shops from the state of Kansas,'' she said.
   ``Anytime you ship a sick puppy to the state of California you
ship grief and you ship heartache,'' she told the crowd.
   ``Puppy mills'' is the term used by animal-rights activists for
commercial kennels that ship sick dogs and cats to out-of-state pet
stores.
   California animal-rights activists' war of words with Gov. Mike
Hayden and Attorney General Bob Stephan escalated last week when
Stephan said the complaints about so-called puppy mills in Kansas
were coming from ``bozos from California.''
   Stephan said Tuesday the issues were being obscured by the
rhetoric.
   ``I accept part of the blame for this because I spoke in
anger,'' he told a news conference.
   He also obtained a search warrant for a kennel that he said was
not up to state standards, but denied that the crackdown was
prompted by the protests from California.
   Delivery of the 40 boxes of dog biscuits was prompted partly by
a Kansas law passed this year that spells out penalties for people
who trespass on animal research facilities to take pictures.
   The Californians say the law protects puppy mills, but Stephan
says it does not apply to commercial kennels.

<HEAD>CBS Study Finds Less Channel-Switching on Networks Than On Rivals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The three major networks, which have steadily
lost audiences to cable since 1980, released a CBS study Thursday
that shows viewers in four cities stay tuned to network TV 2{ times
longer than to cable.
   The reaction from a leading cable industry group was immediate.
   ``I think they're trying to discredit cable as a growing and
important source of programming for viewers,'' said Robert Alter,
president of the Cable Television Advertising Bureau.
   Made public by the new Network Television Association, the study
of prime-time viewing in the week of Nov. 6-12 last year was based
in part on Nielsen data from 702 homes in New York, Los Angeles,
Chicago and Philadelphia.
   The study analyzed viewing of the three networks, Fox
Broadcasting, and six major cable networks _ the USA Network, the
Family Channel, ESPN, MTV, and Ted Turner's Cable News Network and
TBS Superstation in Atlanta.
   It found that viewers, including those with remote-control
channel switchers some call ``zappers,'' are apt to change cable
channels almost three times more than they do network channels.
   ``I think zapping is a fact of life ... but it happens a lot
less on network television than on cable _ that's what the study
shows,'' said Tom Delaney, CBS' director of marketing research.
   He spoke at a news conference held by the network association,
formed by CBS, NBC and ABC in April to represent them in their
battle to keep viewers and advertisers from defecting to cable and
independent stations.
   CBS' four-city study said that uninterrupted viewing of networks
averages 27 minutes per tune-in, compared to 19 minutes for Fox
stations and 11 minutes for cable.
   The study will be sent to advertisers in a bid to convince them
that their commercials are more likely to be seen on the networks.
   The study's release comes as advertisers prepare for so-called
``upfront'' buying of television time for next season, with advance
purchases of network time expected to reach $4 billion.
   The networks will be competing with cable for advertisers in the
upfront market, and ``that's really the impetus of the release of
that study,'' said Alter. He said cable has become a major player
in that market.
   Four years ago, it earned $40 million in pre-season sales, he
said. Last year, he added, the figure was $500 million, and this
year ``will be a record upfront'' for cable, with $750 million to
$800 million in sales projected.

<HEAD>PLO Condemns Bush's Decision to Suspend Dialogue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALAH NASRAWI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PLO leaders said Thursday the United States
was hostile to Palestinians, and urged Arab action against
Washington's suspension of the U.S.-PLO dialogue.
   A statement by the PLO executive committee said President Bush's
decision ``will encourage Israel to pursue its repressive practices
against the Palestinian people and increase their crimes and
massacres in the ocupied territories.
   ``The dialogue was a step forward on the road to peace and its
suspension will reduce the U.S. role in the Middle East peace
process,'' the statement said.
   The statement was the Palestine Liberation Organization's first
official response to Bush's announcement Wednesday that the
18-month-old talks had been suspended.
   It was issued after a meeting of the 15-member Executive Council
in Baghdad, the Iraqi capitalm called to discuss developments on
the Palestinian issue and the formation of a new right-wing Israeli
government.
   In Jerusalem, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir praised Bush's
action and urged the United States to end the dialogue permanently.
   Bush said he suspended the talks because the PLO did not
forcefully condemn an unsuccessful May 30 seaborne terrorist attack
against Israel.
   In their statement, the PLO leaders said U.S. Middle East policy
reflected ``a total bias'' in favor of Israel, which constitutes
``a major challenge to the Arabs.''
   ``Arabs are required to face up to the American challenge and to
implement resolutions adopted at the last Arab summit conference in
Baghdad last month,'' it said.
   That was a reference to summit resolutions calling on Arab
states to re-evaluate their political and economic relations with
other countries on the basis of their policies toward the
Palestinians.
   The U.S.-PLO dialogue began after PLO chairman Yasser Arafat met
long-standing U.S. conditions for talks by renouncing terrorism and
accepting Israel's right to exist. Since then, the U.S. ambassador
to Tunisia has met regularly with PLO officials at the
organization's headquarters in Tunis.
   Bush had urged Arafat to condemn the seaborne assault and
discipline the PLO faction that sent the two speedboats filled with
fighters to a Tel Aviv beach. The boats were intercepted by Israeli
soldiers, who killed four guerrillas and arrested 12. There were no
Israeli casualties.
   The attack was carried out by the Palestine Liberation Front led
by Mohammed Abbas, better known as Abul Abbas, who planned the 1985
hijacking of the Achille Lauro cruise liner, in a disabled American
was killed.
   Arafat denied PLO responsibility for the seaborne raid. The
executive committee said the movement remained committed to
Arafat's December 1988 renunciation of terrorism and that there was
no evidence Abbas' group planned to attack civilian targets.
   Bush called the PLO response was ``not sufficient,'' but said
the United States was prepared to resume the dialogue immediately
if the PLO condemned the raid and disciplined Abbas.
   In its latest statement, the PLO executive committee reiterated
its earlier position on the May 30 raid. It said only the Palestine
National Council, or parliament-in-exile, which elects the
executive committee, could decide whether to expel Abbas.
   ``The Palestinian leadership had taken a responsible and clear
stand on the coast operation,'' the committee said in its five-page
statement, ``but despite that, the U.S. administration took the
decision to break off the dialogue, uncovering its true hostile
policies toward the Palestinian people.
   ``This is clear evidence that Israel and its branches inside the
American administration still control the decision-making process.''
   The PLO leaders expressed surprise that Washington was making an
issue of an attempted raid in which no Israelis were hurt, ``while
it maintains silence toward Israeli crimes against Palestinians.''
   In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, masked Palestinians chanting
``No to America!'' marched through cities Thursday to protest the
U.S. decision.
   In annexed Arab east Jerusalem, stone-throwing Palestinian women
and masked youths clashed with riot police after an Arab was killed
there in an earlier protest over the U.S. decision.
   Shamir said Washington's determination to fight terrorism would
not be clear until it cuts its dialogue with the PLO permanently.
   ``I hope that the suspension will not be temporary but instead
will open a new chapter in relations between the United States and
the Middle East,'' Shamir said on Israel radio.
   Israel objects to any PLO involvement in peace efforts, claiming
the organization is a terrorist group bent on destroying the Jewish
state.

   The earthquake that devastated Iran early
Thursday took tens of thousands of lives because people were asleep
in fragile homes built on flood plains, an earthquake expert said.
   ``Most casualties from earthquakes are caused by something
falling on top of you,'' said Russ Needham, a geophysist with the
U.S. Geological Survey that monitors ground motion around the world.
   The quake hit at 12:30 a.m. in Iran, when most of the people
were in their homes, Needham said Thursday in a telephone interview
from Golden, Colo.
   At least 25,000 people died and thousands were injured in the
quake, which demolished scores of villages and buried thousands of
people in the rubble of their homes, Iranian officials said.
   Needham said most structures in that area are built of a
ceramic-type brick or adobe that collapses easily.
   ``It's very similar to what we had in Armenia,'' he said of the
Dec. 7, 1988, earthquake that killed about 25,000 people.
   A Soviet parliamentary report later blamed the high number of
fatalities on shoddily built buildings.
   The Armenian quake was measured at 6.9 on the Richter scale, but
Thursday's earthquake shook the earth with a magnitude of 7.7.
   The shock wave traveled through the mountainous section of
coastal Iran where most of the buildings are built on a flood plain
of loosely deposited soil that shifts in an earthquake and allows
structures to collapse, he said.
   The 7.7-magnitude quake was the largest ever recorded in that
area, where two major plates of the earth's crust meet, Needhams
said.
   ``Iran is in a very active seismic region,'' he said, and that
there have been many smaller quakes.
   Twelve earthquakes greater than magnitude 7 have occurred in
Iran during the last 30 years, Needhams said.
   A quake of magnitude 7 is considered a major earthquake, capable
of widespread, heavy damage in populated areas.

   Environmentalists expressed concern Thursday
that the Bush administration would fail to give enough protection
to the rare spotted owl when it announces its plans Friday under
the Endangered Species Act.
   ``I think the Forest Service is under incredible pressure to do
less than the right thing,'' said Frances Hunt of the National
Wildlife Federation.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has set an announcement for
Friday on its plans for protecting the spotted owl.
   A decision to make the rare, two-foot-tall brownish bird a
``threatened species'' could close millions of acres of forest in
northern California, Oregon and Washington to logging, at a
potential cost of tens of thousands of jobs.
   Such a decision _ widely predicted by environmentalists,
industry officials and members of Congress _ would make it illegal
to harm any of the estimated 3,000 to 5,000 pairs of surviving owls
or destroy their critical habitat without government approval.
   The announcement is expected to cap a bruising battle between
environmentalists who favor maximum protection for the owl, and the
timber industry fearful for its own future. The actual plans for
protecting the owl are expected to be drawn up by the Forest
Service and other government agencies.
   White House deputy press secretary Stephen Hart said that if the
owl is declared threatened, the White House will monitor the
development of plans to protect it. ``Our goal is that the plan be
balanced between protecting the owl and saving jobs,'' Hart said.
   Environmentalists call the decision as an important precedent in
a larger fight over protection of the Northwest's oldest forests,
because the Forest Service earlier decided the health of the owl is
a good indicator of the overall condition of the forests themselves.
   The decision has been expected since a panel of government
scientists announced in April that current forest management plans
are inadequate to ensure the spotted owl will survive the next 100
years.
   The scientific committee led by Forest Service biologist Jack
Ward Thomas determined the owl has lost about two-thirds of its
habitat since 1800. It recommended more than 3 million acres of
previously unprotected forests _ an area nearly as large as the
state of Connecticut _ be set aside to save the owl from extinction.
   The controversy continued as the formal announcement neared.
   ``My sense is that the listing ... will raise as many questions
as it answers in terms of the immediate implications of what people
are supposed to do,'' said Mark Rey of the industry's American
Forest Resource Alliance.
   A Fish and Wildlife spokesman, Phil Million, said the formal
documents are in the possession of agency director John Turner. He
declined to comment on whether it had been reviewed by White House
staff.
   ``Somebody said it is over 400 pages,'' he said.
   Six Northwest congressman asked President Bush last week to
delay the anticipated listing's effective date until Oct. 1 so the
industry and federal agencies would have time to sort out the
ramifications of the ruling.
   But environmentalists said such a delay would undercut efforts
to protect the owl.
   ``Our fear basically is that would allow business as usual to
continue for the next few months. That would result in the loss of
important spotted owl habitat,'' said Ms. Hunt.
   ``A delay seems inconsistent with what the'' Endangered Species
Act ``is trying to do,'' said Bill Reffalt of The Wilderness
Society.

   They can see it now: campaign commercials,
spawned by the flag debate, aimed straight at them.
   It begins, said Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., with an opponent
saying the issue is not patriotism but judgment. ``Then comes the
graphic 30-second commercial, featuring an unsavory, bearded
lowlife burning a flag, and clearly implying that a particular
senator is less than patriotic because he chose to preserve freedom
over a constitutional amendment,'' said Bradley, a runaway favorite
for re-election, nonetheless concerned about the impact of his
decision to oppose an amendment against flag burning.
   ``The 30-second TV spot can cut both ways,'' said Rep. F. James
Sensenbrenner Jr., R-Wis. and one of the leading House supporters
of the amendment in Thursday's debate. ``I can see some liberal PR
man starting a 30-second spot with the Bill of Rights going up in
flames.''
   Those political worries, and more like them, underlie the debate
about the flag and the Constitution, and they are arguments the
House could not settle with its vote Thursday against an amendment
to permit laws against flag burning.
   The roll call was 254-177, a majority but 34 short of the
two-thirds required. But Senate advocates of an amendment already
had vowed to force a vote there _ pointless legislatively, but not
politically. It takes two-thirds in each house of Congress to send
a proposed amendment to the states for ratification.
   The speaker of the House, Rep. Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said
the amendment vote on Thursday would be the last in that branch.
``We're not going to go around and around and around and around,''
he said.
   But the issue has, ever since the Supreme Court ruled just a
year ago that flag burning was permissible under the First
Amendment to the Constitution. That invalidated 48 state laws
against it and ignited the debate; President Bush pushed an
amendment, and congressional Democrats passed a law forbidding flag
burning instead. The court overturned that this month and the
amendment was revived.
   The 1990 replay never had quite the emotional impetus of the
1989 original, even though a Gallup poll this month showed
two-thirds of the public in favor of a constitutional ban on flag
burning.
   Looking at those numbers, Republican campaign strategists figure
they have an issue that will last. Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., the
minority whip, said it was not an issue that would go away soon. He
said if an amendment isn't sent to the states _ 38 would have to
ratify _ in 1990, it will come up again next year. That way, he
said, Republican congressional candidates who favor an amendment
could demand that their opponents announce positions on a
flag-protection amendment in the next session of Congress.
   ``I don't think this debate is going to end,'' Gingrich said
Thursday, shortly before the amendment was turned down. ``I am
confident that this debate is going to go on for a long time.''
   Democratic opponents called Republican tactics the politics of
fear and intimidation, and said voters will see through it.
   But that is more hope than assurance; nobody is certain how the
issue will play in the campaign ahead.
   That's why the debate has been waged on two levels.
   One is about the flag, the court, the Constitution and freedom
of speech.
   The other, as Bradley said, ``is about pure politics.''
   Because it is, wary Democrats provided a fallback, insurance
vote, on another measure, this one to ban flag burning intended to
incite violence. The court already has overturned one federal
statute, and the outlook for this one would be dubious.
   But the bill and a companion measure in the Senate nonetheless
give opponents of the amendment a way to vote for flag protection _
a vote they can tell their constituents about.

   The United States offered humanitarian aid to
Iran on Thursday and expressed sadness over the loss of life in the
earthquake that struck the northern part of the country.
   U.S. officials said the offer was not intended as a political
signal to Iran but was a gesture of support for the victims, said
Iranian officials to include more than 25,000 dead and tens of
thousands injured.
   State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said Iran has
contacted the U.N. Disaster Relief Office to ask for assistance.
   The United States has not had diplomatic relations with Iran for
10 years and holds that country partially responsible for the
continued detention of American hostages by pro-Iranian elements in
Lebanon.
   The U.S. offer of assistance was to have been relayed to Iranian
authorities by the Swiss Embassy in Tehran, which handles U.S.
interests in Iran.
   As of late Thursday, U.S. officials said that because of the
time difference, they had no confirmation the offer had actually
been delivered to Iranian authorities. In any case, they said, no
response had been received from the Iranian government.
   The officials said a U.S. offer of aid following a previous
natural disaster in Iran was turned down.
   ``We are saddened by the damage and the loss of life,'' said
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater. He said a message of
condolence had been sent to President Hashemi Rafsanjani.

   Federal health officials said Thursday they can't
explain the return of encephalitis to central California last year,
after reports of such viral infections ``had virtually
disappeared.''
   An outbreak of St. Louis encephalitis _ a mosquito-transmitted
arbovirus _ caused 28 cases between August and October in the lower
San Joaquin Valley of California, the national Centers for Disease
Control reported.
   ``During the 1970s and 1980s, reports of these arboviral
infections had virtually disappeared from the Central Valley,'' the
CDC said. ``The reasons for the disappearance and subsequent
recurrence ... are unclear.''
   ``Especially perplexing'' was the absence of cases of Western
equine encephalitis, which is transmitted in the West by the same
mosquito, the CDC added.
   Encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain. Nationwide, the
CDC reported 108 cases of various types of arboviral encephalitis
last year. Other types include Eastern equine encephalitis and La
Crosse encephalitis.

   Federal health officials estimated Thursday that
4,000 infants each year become chronically infected with hepatitis
B virus because their mothers are infected at the time of delivery.
   ``More than 90 percent of such perinatally acquired ...
infections can be prevented,'' through treatment and vaccination as
soon as possible after birth, the Centers for Disease Control said
in its weekly report.
   Transmission from mothers to infants at birth ``is one of the
most efficient modes of spread of hepatitis B,'' the CDC said.
   Out of some 10,000 expectant women seen at Atlanta's Grady
Memorial Hospital between July 1988 and June 1989, 85 were positive
for hepatitis B, the CDC reported.
   ``Health education efforts must be directed at (hepatitis B)
positive mothers to emphasize the importance of hepatitis B
prevention,'' the CDC said.
   The CDC in 1988 recommended hepatitis testing for all pregnant
women, and immediate vaccinations, if needed, for their babies. It
is estimated that 25 percent of the infants who become chronic
hepatitis B carriers will die of liver cancer or cirrhosis.
   Hepatitis B, transmitted chiefly via blood, is one of the two
most common forms of hepatitis, a serious inflammation of the
liver. Some 25,000 cases occur each year in the United States.

   Nearly 3 percent of people tested in one survey
showed signs of infection with viruses that prompted a crackdown on
imported research monkeys earlier this year, government health
officials reported Thursday.
   ``The 2.5, 3 percent is higher than we thought it would be,''
said Dr. Kenneth Herrmann of the Division of Viral Diseases at the
Centers for Disease Control.
   Blood tests for infection with filoviruses _ the family of
viruses that includes the deadly Ebola virus _ were conducted in
the wake of an Ebola-like outbreak in research monkeys imported
from the Philippines to Virginia, Pennsylvania and Texas last
winter.
   At least 42 people exposed to such monkeys have now tested
positive for infection with filovirus, the CDC said Thursday. But
where filoviruses such as Ebola and Marburg virus have killed
hundreds in outbreaks in Africa and Europe, no such illness has
been reported this time in the United States.
   Out of 449 random adult blood tests, 12 _ or 2.7 percent _ were
positive for previous antibodies against filovirus, the CDC said.
The tests were conducted among outpatients at primary-care health
facilities.
   The 12 positive results are unexplained, but suggest ``that
there may be other agents _ filoviruses or other viruses _ that
cross-react with the filovirus that we're concerned about in the
monkeys,'' Herrmann said.
   The CDC earlier this year pulled the registrations of three of
the nation's largest monkey importers and imposed new restrictions
after the outbreak in groups of animals in Virginia and
Pennsylvania.

   Fifty AIDS activists were arrested Thursday
after a march that wound by government office buildings to protest
what demonstrators said was government inaction in the prevention
and treatment of AIDS.
   The second day of demonstrations, held in response to the Sixth
International AIDS Conference, ended when a small group of
activists sat down in a busy intersection after setting fire to a
pile of placards.
   After issuing a warning, police in riot gear surrounded the
group and arrested protesters on charges of remaining at the scene
of an unlawful assembly.
   Eighty people were arrested on Wednesday near the Moscone
Center, the site of the AIDS conference.
   Thursday's protests, which took place about a mile from the AIDS
conference, focused on complaints over lack of government funding
and programs in the San Francisco area. Speakers criticized
reliance on the so-called San Francisco model, a system of
volunteer programs praised and studied as a model for AIDS patients.
   Demonstrators carried signs reading, ``San Francisco AIDS Model
Built on a Fault'' and replicas of dollar bills with bloody hand
prints.
   ``The San Francisco model was developed by people who care, but
they are being overwhelmed,'' said Harvey Maurer, a member of the
city's AIDS-ARC Vigil.
   Jean Harris, a legislative aide to city supervisor Harry Britt,
criticized city officials for relying on volunteers rather than
developing and funding programs for early prevention and treatment
of AIDS patients.
   ``We are dying and the people up there haven't gotten off their
butts,'' she said as the march stopped outside City Hall.
   Outside the Department of Public Health, Bonnie Ferguson, whose
group Prevention Point distributes clean hypodermic needles to
addicts, complained the program has received little other than
praise from Mayor Art Agnos.
   ``Art's been kind to Prevention Point in his public statements,
but we have not been able to get one sterile cotton ball or one
alcohol prep out of him,'' she said.
   The marchers blocked another intersection by a state office
building for a time, passing dollar bill posters back and forth to
symbolize what they said has been a case of passing the buck by
local, state and federal officials.
   A small group ran into the lobby of the building that houses the
state insurance commissioner's office to protest what they said was
a lack of state action on insurance discrimination against AIDS
patients.
   They left a short time later without incident.

<TEXT>
   Checkpoint Charlie, the famed Allied border
crossing by the Berlin Wall, was to be hauled away Friday.
   U.S. Army Sgt. Lorn Walsh late Thursday stood sentry for the
last time by the little white shack, rendered unnecessary by the
thaw in East-West relations.
   ``This is a nice way to end my military service ... to be here
when they take it down,'' said Walsh, 23, a military police officer
who leaves the army in six weeks to study for the priesthood.
   A huge crane hung over the small house in the middle of the
narrow street that leads to East Berlin, where a sign in English,
German, Russian and French says: ``You are now leaving the American
sector.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze and their colleagues from France, Britain and
the two Germanys were to preside over a ceremony marking the
checkpoint's removal Friday.
   The envoys from the German states and the four World War II
Allies that divided them were in East Berlin to discuss the
international aspects of German unification.
   Since East Germany overthrew its Communist government last fall
and the German borders were opened, Checkpoint Charlie has become
as superfluous as the crumbling Berlin Wall.
   With huge sections of the Berlin Wall being ripped down daily,
U.S. officials decided two weeks ago to remove Checkpoint Charlie.
   The border crossing was the scene of stirring escapes and
heartbreaking captures as East Germans tried flee to the West,
breaking through East German control stations just 20 yards away
from the Allied checkpoint.
   East Germans once manned their side of the checkpoint with
emotionless effiency, closely scrutinizing travel documents and
creating a palpable tension. Thursday night, they merely waved
Westerners through their side of the checkpoint, although some
tourists demanded their documents be checked.

   AIDS educators are alarmed by reports that
homosexual and bisexual men are lapsing back into sexual behavior
that could kill them.
   At the Sixth International AIDS Conference on Thursday, several
programs were announced to help the gay community avoid a second,
even larger wave of deadly infection.
   Almost 20 percent of gay and bisexual men surveyed had abandoned
safe-sex practices at least once, according to studies being
presented to the Sixth International AIDS Conference by researchers
from the Center for AIDS Prevention Studies at the University of
California-San Francisco.
   Ten years into the epidemic, educators say they are facing a
community increasingly weary with the burden of maintaining the
massive changes in their lifestyle, a community grieving for the
carefree days forever lost.
   ``People changed because they were scared to death,'' said
Maggie Reinfeld of the Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York, which
has created the nation's first program for confronting the relapse
problem. ``Safer sex gets a lot tougher when you have to live with
it over your whole life. Fear turns into denial, because nobody can
live their whole life in dread of a disease.''
   The American Foundation for AIDS Research announced it has
awarded $in opposition party, the left-leaning Social
Democrats, criticized the treaty, saying it fails to adequately
protect East Germans who face economic hardship in the transition
from socialism to a free market.
   But their chairman, Hans-Jochen Vogel, told the Bundestag a
majority would approve the treaty. Failure to do so would be too
much of a shock to East German expectations and could lead to
``uncontrollable developments,'' he said.
   The leftist Greens Party argued against passage, saying the
treaty would not bring the two Germanys closer together, but would
create newer and deeper forms of division by making East Germany a
dependent institution.
   Some experts predict up to 2 million East Germans could lose
their jobs as outmoded government-owned factories and businesses
try to compete. More than a third of the enterprises are expected
to close and there are fears of social unrest.
   The economic merger treaty comes after months of work following
the collapse late last year of East Germany's Communist government
and the opening of the Berlin Wall. East Germany elected a
non-Communist government in March.
   Kohl acknowledge recognition of Poland's current Western border
was painful for many Germans.
   Nonetheless, he said: ``Either we affirm the present boundary,
or we lose the chance of German unity.''

<HEAD>EPA Says It, Not Industry, Will Evaluate Health Risks at Superfund
Sites</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANE E. ALLEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency will take
over evaluation of health risks at all Superfund hazardous waste
sites because industry is underestimating risks too often,
according to an agency report to Congress released Thursday.
   In addition, the agency said it will require all regional
offices to consult headquarters if they want to simply contain
waste on a site rather than treat it or remove it.
   The Superfund subcommittee of the Senate Environment and Public
Works Committee, chaired by Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., had
requested the report, primarily to examine whether
industry-financed cleanups were using containment, generally easier
than other actions, more than they should.
   ``The first concern is that there continues to be substantial
inconsistency in the calculation of risks, including assumptions
used such as land-use scenarios and routes of exposure, and in how
the data is organized and presented,'' EPA's report said.
   Some risk assessments prepared by private parties ``tend to
underestimate the risk posed by a site, in many cases requiring a
redraft'' by the EPA's regional office, it said.
   The risk assessments primarily try to estimate health dangers
from the site before cleanup, but increasingly they are being used
to estimate what risks would remain after various cleanup options.
   Lautenberg praised EPA's decision to take over the assessment
work, rather than leave it in the hands of whoever is conducting
the cleanup _ EPA, states or private industry.
   ``That's where you're really calculating where the cleanup has
to go _ what's the risk to people in the communities. We ought not
to leave that to parties responsible for pollution in the first
place,'' he said.
   In terms of cleanup decisions at a given site, EPA found ``the
study did not demonstrate great differences in remedies selected''
by the federal government or the polluter.
   ``We found reasons based on differences in the sites rather than
differences in who was doing the cleanup,'' said Bruce Diamond,
director of EPA's Office of Waste Programs Enforcement, at a
hearing of Lautenberg's subcommittee.
   Among those disagreeing with his interpretation were Lautenberg
and several environmental groups.
   ``Generally speaking, where the government finances the
investigative cleanup study, ... cleanups use treatment at a higher
rate than where responsible parties pick up the tab,'' Lautenberg
said.
   Donald Strait of the Natural Resources Defense Council said the
overall treatment rate is 71 percent where government pays for
cleanup studies, compared with 61 percent when industry picks up
the tab.
   Joel S. Hirschhorn, president of the consulting firm
Envirosearch-East who studied Superfund in detail when he was an
analyst with the congressional Office of Technology Assessment,
said the different interpretations arose from different
definitions. For example, he said EPA counts treatment technology
whenever it is used, but only counts land disposal, or containment,
when it is the sole method used.

   The House on Thursday rejected a
constitutional amendment to protect the American flag from
desecration, heeding opponents who said it would risk damage to the
Bill of Rights.
   The 254-177 tally left the amendment, which was supported by
President Bush, 34 votes short of the two-thirds majority required
to amend the Constitution. Republicans voted 159-17 for it,
Democrats 160-95 against.
   The vote followed a sometimes impassioned day of debate
featuring more than 100 speeches, including a rare address by the
speaker of the House, Rep. Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash.
   ``We should not amend the Constitution of the United States to
reach the sparse and scattered and despicable conduct of a few who
would dishonor the flag and defile it,'' said Foley, who also cast
a rare speaker's vote to register his opposition to the amendment.
By tradition, the speaker does not normally engage in debate or
vote.
   Countered Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.: ``Let us take the flag out of
the gutter where the counterculture has dragged it and is smearing
it. We have 10 amendments that guarantee us all sorts of rights.
How about one amendment that gives us a duty?''
   Foley told reporters that Thursday's vote would be the last one
on the amendment this year in the House, but Republicans promised
to keep the issue alive.
   ``I am confident this debate is going to go on for a long
time,'' Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., told the chamber. Asked about
the Bush's efforts on behalf of the amendment, Gingrich said ``it
was very hard for the president in two days to override the
speaker.''
   Supporters of the amendment, backed by veterans' groups seeking
more time to lobby, had tried to delay Thursday's vote until next
week but were defeated 231-192.
   Rep. Rep. G.V. Montgomery, D-Miss., the chairman of the House
Veterans Committee and the amendment's prime Democratic sponsor,
said of the proposal, ``I think we owe it to the brave Americans
who have died for this country.''
   But Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., decried the attempt to modify the
First Amendment.
   ``When I look around the politicians today, I see more people
who remind me of Daffy Duck than Thomas Jefferson,'' he said.
   The strength of the opposition was larger than expected and was
aided by the unexpected support of some conservatives.
   ``Up until 24 hours ago, I was a sponsor of this amendment,''
said Rep. Tim Valentine, D-N.C. ``But over the rhetoric of the past
few days, I finally heard the voice of my own conscience.''
   The amendment read, ``The Congress and the states shall have
power to prohibit physical desecration of the flag of the United
States.''
   It was first proposed in 1989 after the Supreme Court ruled that
flag burning was a form of protected free speech. The issue was
revived last week when the court rejected last year's attempt to
pass an anti-flag-burning law that the court could accept.
   After the vote on the amendment, the House also rejected a new
statute _ not a constitutional amendment _ to ban flag burning.
   The bill, narrowly drawn in hopes of avoiding court rejection,
would impose fines and jail terms for people who burn flags to
promote violence or who burn flags on federal property or belonging
to the federal government.
   Republicans voted overwhelmingly against it after their
leadership called it a ``fig leaf'' to protect Democrats who
opposed the constitutional amendment, and it lost 236-179.
   The Senate is expected to vote next week on the amendment, which
would require a two-thirds vote in both chambers, and approval by
38 of the 50 states, for ratification. Foley said the House would
not vote again this year.
   Regardless of the outcome on Capitol Hill, Republicans promise
to raise the issue in this fall's campaign. The House majority
leader, Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., acknowledged the political
tightrope members were walking.
   Several members decorated their speeches with flags and other
props.
   Rep. Gary Ackerman, trying to highlight the difficulty of
enforcing legislation to protect the flag, held aloft a wide
variety of household items and gags decorated with the stars and
stripes.
   ``How about American flag napkins,'' he said, holding one.
``What if you blow your nose in one. Have you broken the law?''
   Although Ackerman said he was not trying to trivialize the
debate, Rep. James Inhofe, R-Okla., said he was offended.
   Most Republican speakers supported the amendment; the bulk of
opposition came from Democrats.
   There also was a noticeable generational tilt in the debate.
   House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., a decorated World War
II veteran, co-sponsored the amendment and called it ``a measured,
prudent, limited thoughtful approach to the problem.''
   ``Surely this is something different from the `assault on the
Bill of Rights' some critics say it is,'' he said.
   Rep. James H. Quillen, R-Tenn., another World War II vet, used
photographs of the famed Iwo Jima flag raising and of a
flag-burning protest in New York's Central Park to dramatize his
support for the amendment.
   But Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., a Vietnam veteran who said he
would ``never forget the sacrifices that have been made so that our
flag can fly proudly and freely,'' was a leader of the opposition.
   ``In 200 years of our history, these basic freedoms have never
been amended, never. And if we start now, who knows what freedoms
will be next? ... Where will it end?'' he asked.

   Flags were waved; the Bill of Rights was held
aloft; even some red, white and blue pantyhose were displayed
Thursday as members of the House spoke for or against a proposed
constitutional amendment against flag burning.
   Members voted for the amendment 254-177, well short of the
two-thirds majority required.
   Rep. James H. Quillen, R-Tenn., portrayed the issue as one of
patriotism versus anti-patriotism with a pair of stirring
poster-size photographs. One showed Marines raising the flag on Iwo
Jima in World War II. The other was a Vietnam-era flag burning in
New York's Central Park.
   Rep. Bill Sarpalius, D-Texas, carried a flag to the lectern to
show his support for the proposal. Later, Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., held up an even larger flag as he spoke in opposition to
the amendment.
   A copy of the Bill of Rights was displayed by Rep. Ben Jones,
D-Ga., who said he would vote against the flag amendment to protect
those constitutional freedoms.
   Rep. Gary Ackerman brought a box of props to illustrate his
speech on the inherent difficulty of enforcing legislation to
protect the flag.
   He held up, one at a time, a hat, socks, pantyhose, a paper
plate and a bathing suit _ ``I'll spare you the athletic
supporters'' _ all decorated with the stars and stripes.
   ``How about American flag napkins?'' he asked, holding one.
``What if you blow your nose in one? Have you broken the law?,'' he
said to the laughter of his colleagues.
   Ackerman said he was not trying to trivialize the debate. But
Rep. James Inhofe, R-Okla., said he was ``offended personally'' by
Ackerman's examples.
   As the debate went on inside, about 30 demonstrators on the
Capitol lawn protested the amendment. An equal number of police
officers kept watch.
   Most demonstrators were from a group called the Vietnam Veterans
Against the War-Anti-Imperialist.
   ``The big mouths in there _ We're challenging them to a
debate,'' declared Dave Blalock of Highland Park, N.J., jerking his
thumb toward the Capitol Dome.

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panicked Monrovians scrambled to get on
planes and cars leaving the city Thursday, a day after rebels
captured a town 15 miles northeast of the capital.
   The fall of Careysburg gave the rebels control of an entrance to
the U.S. government's Voice of America transmitter for Africa. The
transmitter is about 1 mile from the settlement.
   No Americans were at the huge radio relay station Wednesday when
rebels seeking the ouster of President Samuel Doe attacked and
within hours seized the town, according to Western diplomats and
Careysburg residents who fled to Monrovia.
   Careysburg is a settlement of gracious houses styled after the
southern U.S. plantation mansions. Careysburg was built by the
freed American slaves who founded this West African nation in 1847.
   The rebels have been advancing toward the capital since late
December.
   On Thursday, fist fights almost broke out at the small Spriggs
Payne airfield among passengers who elbowed their way aboard two
chartered planes heading east for Abidjan, the capital of
neighboring Ivory Coast.
   The exodus west by road to Sierra Leone has been slowed by a
fuel shortage. On Thursday, hundreds of cars were lined up outside
gas stations in Monrovia and people fought to buy fuel, which has
nearly doubled in price.
   The rebel advance comes a few days before a second round of
peace talks between the warring parties is scheduled to begin in
Freetown, Sierra Leone. After a first round earlier this month, the
rebels signed an agreement pledging to ``exercise self-restraint in
the use of military force.''
   Church sources said a delegation of Christian and Moslem leaders
mediating the talks met Thursday with Doe at his Atlantic oceanside
mansion in Monrovia.
   ``We're not optimistic,'' one church leader. He said Doe dwelled
on concessions he has made, including a promise not to stand for
re-election at polls scheduled in October 1991.
   The Liberian leader has refused to concede to a rebel demand
that he resign, saying it would leave a dangerous power vacuum.
   There had been a lull in the fighting, after government troops
chased rebels from the headquarters of the U.S.-managed Firestone
rubber plantation and adjoining Robertsfield International Airport,
35 miles east of Monrovia.
   In late May as the rebels advanced, airlines stopped flying into
Robertsfield, Liberia's main airport. The Spriggs Payne airfield
has been beseiged by hundreds of people fleeing the city aboard
chartered flights.
   Nearly half of Doe's 17 Cabinet members have fled the country.
Government sources said the president this week ordered Cabinet
members to return or lose their positions, but did not get a
satisfactory response.
   The insurgency, led by Charles Taylor, began in December and has
since escalated into a tribal conflict. Most rebels come from the
Gio and Mano tribes, while government supporters are mostly Krahns
and Mandingos. Doe himself is a Krahn.
   Rebels accuse Doe of corruption and rights abuses. Doe took
power in a violent 1980 coup that ousted the American descendents,
who historically monopolized power and discriminated against
indigenous Liberians.

   Marion Barry's attorney on Thursday revealed
inconsistencies in statements by a key government witness in the
mayor's drug and perjury trial and accused him of lying to save
himself from a long prison term.
   But Charles Lewis, completing his testimony after three days on
the stand, stuck to his story that he and Barry smoked crack
cocaine together in the nation's capital and the Virgin Islands.
   ``You care for yourself,'' Lewis said when defense attorney R.
Kenneth Mundy compared his statements to investigators.
   ``That's exactly it,'' Mundy said. ``If you would lie (to the
grand jury) in January 1989 to save Marion Barry, a man who is not
a particular friend, you would surely lie in August 1989 to protect
Charles Lewis ... and a lot of other people who are closer to you,
wouldn't you?''
   ``No, I wouldn't,'' Lewis responded.
   Barry, 54, has pleaded innocent to three felony counts of
perjury, one misdemeanor count of conspiracy and nine counts of
cocaine possession.
   Lewis testified in his three days on the witness stand that he
shared drugs with the three-term mayor repeatedly between 1986 and
1988. A convicted drug dealer, Lewis is facing sentencing on
drug-related charges in his native Virgin Islands.
   Mundy attacked Lewis' credibility, saying the witness had
several times told investigators one thing and jurors in the trial
another.
   The defense attorney read from Lewis' testimony to a grand jury
last year that Barry visited Lewis at a Washington hotel one night
after a Monday Night Football game had ended. Lewis alleged this
week that the mayor was there earlier, during the game, using crack
cocaine.
   If the earlier testimony is true, Barry ``wouldn't have been
there at all on the 19th ... Would he?'' Mundy said.
   ``Marion Barry was there that Monday night,'' Lewis told Mundy.
   Lewis said another contradiction between his grand jury
statements and trial testimony _ on where he and Barry allegedly
discussed drugs at one point _ resulted from a ``misunderstanding''
by the court reporter at the grand jury.
   Mundy also said Lewis' testimony suggested a third person may
have been present when he and Barry allegedly smoked crack in
Lewis's hotel room on Dec. 22, 1988.
   Lewis said that implication was a ``mistake ... There was no
security, no one else.''
   Lewis also agreed with Mundy's suggestion that he was not close
friends with Barry, but said the two felt ``comfortable'' together.
   Barry ``felt comfortable with me and I felt comfortable with him
on those short occasions'' when they used drugs, Lewis told said
Mundy.
   The federal probe of Barry began when city police aborted an
attempted undercover drug buy from Lewis when they discovered Barry
was in Lewis' Washington hotel room in December 1988.
   Lewis said Wednesday that he and Barry ``agreed to get our
stories straight'' after the mayor's visits to Lewis became public
and that Barry asked him to lie to police about their alleged drug
use.
   After Lewis testified, a bellhop at the Washington hotel where
Lewis and Barry allegedly used cocaine supported some of Lewis'
testimony. The bellhop said he saw Barry arrive at the hotel on
three of the four days Lewis has said the mayor visited him.
   Police found traces of cocaine on the desk and nightstand inside
Lewis' hotel room on Dec. 23, 1988, according to a document
introduced into evidence by prosecutors. Defense attorneys agreed
to the contents of the record.
   Lewis is cooperating with the government in its case against
Barry as part of a plea bargain agreement resulting from separate
drug charges in the nation's capital.

   A House committee on Thursday approved a $15.8
billion foreign aid bill that begins shifting America's emphasis
from military to economic help, declaring: ``The West has won the
Cold War, and we have a right to say so!''
   But the measure won approval by the Appropriations Committee
only after Rep. David Obey, chairman of the foreign aid
subcommittee, agreed to restore $144 million to military aid
accounts as the price of Republican support for the package.
   Other major disputes over U.S. aid to El Salvador, to Cambodian
rebels and to international population control agencies were
deferred until the measure goes to the full House, expected to be
next week.
   The panel, citing diminished East-West tensions, diverted
roughly $400 million in military aid to refugee aid, children's
programs and development assistance for countries from Eastern
Europe to Africa and Latin America.
   Obey, D-Wis., called President Bush's request for $5 billion in
military aid, an increase of $300 million over the current level,
``particularly quaint, given the changes in the world.'' The
committee's report claimed victory in the Cold War and accused the
administration of proposing a ``sleepwalker's budget.''
   Instead, the panel approved just over $4.6 billion in military
aid to friends and allies around the globe, $144 million more than
Obey's subcommittee had voted last week.
   To win GOP support, Obey also agreed to provide $50 million for
the World Bank, just less than half of what Bush had asked. Obey
has fought what he sees as the practice of giving money to
international lenders which ends up going to bail out large
commercial banks from loans made to Third World countries.
   And in another concession to the White House, the panel agreed
to raise aid ceilings for three countries which host U.S. military
bases. Turkey would get $430 million, up $30 million from the
earlier version of the bill; Greece would be increased from $280
million to $301 million; and Portugal would go from $90 million to
$95 million. All remained substantially below current-year levels.
   Although Republicans agreed to advance the bill to the full
House, the administration still had major problems with some of its
provisions.
   At the top of the list were its restrictions on aid to El
Salvador. The bill would withhold half of next year's expected $85
million in military aid; the fate of the money would depend on
progress in peace talks between the government and leftist rebels
who have waged a 10-year civil war.
   The assistant secretary of state for the hemisphere, Bernard
Aronson, met late Thursday with key lawmakers of both parties to
begin forging a compromise bipartisan policy toward El Salvador
that could be substituted for that part of the bill.
   Participants said Aronson brought a counterproposal to the
meeting, calling for similar conditions on the U.S. aid money but
restricting a smaller proportion of it, perhaps 25 percent to 30
percent. But Democrats were coming under pressure from liberal
members to hold the line and make no concessions to the
administration.
   Another fight loomed over a section barring any aid to the
non-communist resistance coalition in Cambodia that includes the
Khmer Rouge, the group believed to have massacred some 1 million
Cambodians when it ruled Cambodia in the 1970s.
   About $7 million a year in U.S. humanitarian aid now flows to
the resistance coalition, which is fighting the
Vietnamese-installed government of Cambodia. The United States
supports the faction of Prince Norodom Sihanouk and provides aid
even though some of it finds its way to the Khmer Rouge, the
militarily strongest part of the coalition.
   Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., planned to fight the provision on
the floor because he believes it would undermine the resistance in
United Nations-sponsored talks aimed at setting up elections.

<HEAD>`Black Widow' Killer Wins Reprieve From Electric Chair</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By IKE FLORES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ``Black Widow'' killer won a temporary
stay of execution from a federal judge Thursday, just four hours
before she was to go to the electric chair for poisoning her
husband.
   U.S. District Judge Patricia Fawsett blocked the scheduled 12:01
p.m. execution of Judi Buenoano at Florida State Prison to hear
arguments on whether the state's electric chair can malfunction and
cruelly torture a prisoner.
   The defense contends it can, citing the state's botched
execution May 4 of Jesse Tafero. Flames and smoke shot out from
under Tafero's hood, and witnesses said he seemed to breathe and
move after two of the three jolts he was given.
   Buenoano's case went before a federal court for the first time
after the state Supreme Court voted 4-3 Wednesday to reject the
appeal on the grounds that Florida's chair is defective.
   Following her 8:00 a.m. ruling, Fawsett spent the day listening
to arguments, then adjourning the hearing until Friday. Ms.
Buenoano's death warrant does not expire until Monday.
   Ms. Buenoano, 47, could become the first women executed in
Florida since the state's electric chair came into use in 1924, and
the 23rd person put to death in the state, and the 131st
nationally, since the U.S. Supreme Court lifted its death-penalty
ban in 1976.
   Only one woman has been executed in the United States since the
high court's ruling. North Carolina executed Velma Barfield by
injection in 1984 for poisoning her boyfriend.
   Prosecutors nicknamed Ms. Buenoano the Black Widow because of
her record of trying, in most cases successfully, to kill the men
in her life. She was condemned for the 1971 fatal poisoning of her
husband, but was also convicted of drowning her paralyzed,
19-year-old son and trying to kill a boyfriend with a bomb.
   In the hearing Thursday, an execution-equipment expert testified
that Florida's chair is so badly made it can malfunction and
torture a prisoner at any time.
   Fred A. Leuchter Jr., who designs and manufactures execution
systems and hardware, told Fawsett a bad electrode caused the
sparks, smoke and flames around Tafero's head.
   ``If no modifications or changes are made ... this could reoccur
in every execution that comes up, or every other one, or
intermittently,'' said Leuchter.
   But the state argued that the smoke and flame were caused by a
synthetic sponge attached to the electrode. It has been replaced
and everything is in working order for the next execution, the
Department of Corrections has said.
   Assistant Attorney General Margene Roper repeated contentions by
prison officials that Tafero did not suffer and was dead after the
first of three surges of electricity.
   Leuchter, who was dubbed ``Dr. Death'' on a recent television
show featuring his execution systems, called Florida's chair a
makeshift device, poorly made and maintained.
   He said corrosion or a break in an electrode resulted in a
non-lethal charge that did not kill Tafero until he was jolted
three times.
   Defense lawyer Jay Nickerson pointed to Ms. Buenoano, sitting at
the defense table, and asked Leuchter, ``can you say that this
woman when she is strapped into the electric chair ... will not
experience cruel and unnecessary punishment?''
   ``No, I cannot,'' answered Leuchter.
   The state plans to reschedule the execution as soon as any stay
expired, said Jon Peck, a spokesman for Gov. Bob Martinez.
   ``We are fully confident that we know what went wrong in the
last execution and it's been fixed,'' said Peck.
   Ms. Buenoano was taken from the prison in Starke to Orlando on
Thursday morning on Fawsett's order, according to state Department
of Corrections spokeswoman Paula Tully.

   The Christa McAuliffe Planetarium was
dedicated Thursday as a memorial to the teacher-astronaut killed in
the Challenger disaster and a way to honor her passion for
motivating children to learn.
   ``This planetarium is more than a memorial to Christa McAuliffe
... it is more than a planetarium. It is a promise to continue the
work she believed in and a promise to fulfill her dream,'' said
NASA Administrator Richard Truly.
   About 1,500 people, including some of McAuliffe's former
students and White House Chief of Staff John Sununu, attended the
opening ceremony.
   The $2.6 million planetarium is New Hampshire's official
memorial to the 37-year-old Concord High School teacher, who died
with six other astronauts when the space shuttle exploded in
January 1986.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration had selected
McAuliffe as its first citizen in space from among 11,000 teachers
who applied for the spot.
   ``Christa was selected because she was an extraordinary role
model as a teacher and an extraordinary role model as a person,''
her widower, Steven, said Thursday.
   He said his wife's goal was to excite and motivate children to
learn and that she saw her shuttle mission as a way to ``honorably
and credibly represent classroom teachers and the debt and respect
that we owe to them.''
   McAuliffe and other speakers said the planetarium has
accomplished those goals.
   At a news conference before the dedication, Truly said he'd like
to see ordinary citizens return to space, but made no promises
because of the backlog of missions caused by the Challenger
disaster.
   Truly, who flew on two shuttle missions, said the experience of
spaceflight ``is deserving to be shared with people who are not
just like me.''
   ``Right now we've got a series of important, precious, national
missions to get off, and we've got our hands full, so I'm going to
put that (decision) off a little bit,'' he said. He has made
similar statements before.
   The planetarium resulted from ``the fierce pride and love of
people who cared about someone and who cared about what Christa
cared about,'' said Sununu, who was New Hampshire's governor when
the Challenger exploded.
   Most of the funding for the planetarium came from the state, but
there were private donations as well, including money raised by
schoolchildren across New Hampshire.
   The planetarium, which took 18 months to build, features an
interactive system that allows the audience to select by an
electronic majority vote where they want to travel in the universe.
It also will allow journeys into mathematics, geology, meteorology,
art, the history of music or the demise of the dinosaurs.
   A special commission chose the planetarium from scores of
suggestions for memorials to McAuliffe, including a portrait, a
state holiday or a brightly lit statue atop Mount Washington, New
England's highest peak.
   Louise Wiley of Pittsfield suggested the planetarium.
   She said Thursday she had envisioned a smaller planetarium in a
high school that students would run. ``Never in a million years did
I think it would end up like this,'' she said.
   ``It is a dream. We had tears in our eyes watching it.''
   McAuliffe's mother, Grace Corrigan, looked on with pride.
   ``I'm very happy and very proud to think that something so
disastrous is culminating in something so wonderful,'' she said.

<HEAD>Fed Vows Border Crackdown, But Proposes Lottery for Immigrants</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mexicans who repeatedly cross the U.S. border
illegally will be prosecuted instead of being shipped home, the top
federal immigration official said Thursday.
   Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Gene McNary
also vowed to seek prosecution and imprisonment for people who
smuggle aliens.
   McNary said he favors creating a lottery to allow some
foreigners to enter the United States even if they don't meet
existing requirements that they have relatives or jobs waiting for
them in this country.
   But McNary said his superiors in the Bush administration might
reject his lottery proposal.
   The commissioner, who took over the federal agency last October,
spoke during a Thursday news conference and at a luncheon meeting
of Town Hall of California, a civic group.
   The number of Border Patrol agents in the San Diego area will
increase from the current 750 to about 1,000 within a year, McNary
said. More detention facilities and improved border lighting and
detection devices will be added, he said.
   About 40 percent to 45 percent of all illegal aliens entering
the United States cross a 12- to 14-mile stretch of the border near
San Diego, McNary said. The INS now lets most illegal aliens return
to Mexico voluntarily without formal deportation proceedings _ a
process McNary called ``a revolving door.''
   The policy will continue for many illegal immigrants. But people
who smuggle aliens and those aliens who cross the border repeatedly
will be fingerprinted, detained and deported, he said.
   Those who violate deportation orders by re-entering the United
States can be charged with a misdemeanor the first time and a
felony the second time, he added.
   ``We're talking about the serious offenders,'' he said. The INS
estimates there are about 1,000 smugglers who ``live off and prey
on innocent victims,'' he said.
   McNary acknowledged the get-tough approach might create a big
backlog of court cases, but said it should have a deterrent effect.
   ``A lot of people would like to have a big wall or ditch or
something,'' McNary said, adding he simply wants ``to try to
enforce the existing laws.''
   McNary discouraged American motorists who on recent nights have
lined up on the U.S. side of the border to shine their headlights
toward Mexico to dissuade illegal immigration.
   As for any Americans who might take stronger measures to
discourage illegal immigration, McNary declared: ``I have
absolutely no tolerance for vigilantes, absolutely none.''

   Comedian Sam Kinison's new bodyguard was
arrested for investigation of rape Thursday after the entertainer's
girlfriend was assaulted, and shot at her attacker at Kinison's
home, police said.
   Nobody was hit by the gunfire.
   Kinison _ known for his screaming, foul-mouthed comic routines _
was in the large Hollywood Hills house at the time but didn't know
about the violence until afterward, said police and the
entertainer's spokesman, Jeff Albright.
   Unway Carter, 22, described by Detective Gil Jones as Kinison's
6-foot, 4-inch, 300-pound bodyguard, was booked at the Hollywood
police station.
   ``The victim was attacked in her bedroom in the residence,''
said Jones, who said Kinison, 36, was asleep in another room.
``After the rape was completed, the victim, in her 20s, excused
herself to go to the bathroom,'' Jones said.
   ``She walked through the bathroom and entered another adjoining
bedroom, where she knew there was a gun. She returned and fired
four shots at Carter, but missed him,'' said Jones.
   The woman then ran to a neighbor's home to phone police, said
Jones.
   Carter was arrested leaving the Nichols Canyon home.
   Jones said the woman, in her 20s, was treated for the sexual
assault but was otherwise unharmed.
   Detective James Tiampo, who made the arrest, told reporters the
gun used in the incident was a .44-caliber Magnum, and all the
shots appeared to have been fired inside the home.
   ``Sam is badly shaken up by this whole incident and is
unavailable to talk about it,'' said the entertainer's spokesman,
Jeff Albright.
   Police Capt. Rick Dinse said Kinison met Carter Wednesday night
at a private party at a Hollywood club.
   ``Mr. Kinison met him and asked him to accompany him as a
bodyguard, for lack of a better term,'' Dinse said.
   Dinse said Carter and Kinison went to the home later that night.
The woman was not with the men during the evening.
   Albright, however, said he believed Carter had been Kinison's
bodyguard for a longer period. He said he didn't know exactly how
long they had been acquainted.
   Dinse said he had few details on Carter's background. He said
the man told police he'd recently arrived in Los Angeles from the
South, and that police were checking to see if Carter had a
criminal record.
   Kinison's comedy has been the target of protests by women and
homosexual groups. His current comedy LP is titled ``Leader of the
Banned.''

<TEXT>
   A constitutional agreement aimed at keeping
French-speaking Quebec in the Canadian federation was on the brink
of death Thursday, blocked in two provinces as the deadline for
passage approached.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney flew to St. John's, Newfoundland,
one of the holdouts, in an effort to save the agreement, which must
be ratified by all 10 provinces by midnight Saturday or expire. He
warned that sinking the accord could prompt another referendum in
Quebec _ this time by the separatists.
   Troubles loomed too in Winnipeg, Manitoba, where a legislator
has managed to block debate for a week on the agreement.
   Eight of the provinces favor the Meech Lake accord, as it is
called, and Mulroney is one of the most ardent supporters of the
agreement.
   In a restrained but tough address, Mulroney confronted
Newfoundland's 52-seat legislature with the possibility of
constitutional paralysis, economic problems and increased support
for the separatist cause.
   ``On that night, when you're sitting there with your family and
your children, one thought is going to go through your mind: do you
mean to tell me that we could have avoided all of this for Meech
Lake?'' Mulroney said.
   ``If that night were ever to come, the terms of Meech Lake are
going to look very, very reasonable indeed to every member of this
House of Assembly and every house of assembly across Canada.''
   One hour after Mulroney concluded his address, a bomb threat
forced a 45-minute evacuation of the legislature.
   The five-point agreement would designate Quebec a ``distinct
society,'' something the Supreme Court would be obliged to consider
when looking at specific laws challenged under the constitution.
   The Meech Lake agreement, first approved by the prime minister
and the premiers of the provinces in 1987, is aimed at winning
Quebec's signature on Canada's 1982 constitution. At that time, the
ministers set a three-year deadline for approval by the Parliament
and legislatures.
   In the interim, governments changed in three of the provinces _
Manitoba, Newfoundland, and New Brunswick _ and the premiers
reneged on the signatures of their predecessors.
   In early June, Mulroney called the premiers to Ottawa where they
spent a week in intense private meetings. They agreed to pass the
original accord as it is. New Brunswick passed it last week.
   Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells put the agreement up for a vote
in his legislature, where it is still being debated.
   The biggest challenge has come from Manitoba. Legislator Elijah
Harper, who as a Cree is the only Indian in the provincial
legislature, has said he will kill Meech Lake because it does not
take native rights into consideration.
   Many of the Indians and Inuit leaders of Canada believe their
societies are as distinct as Quebec's, and they also want to be
recognized in the constitution.
   Manitoba law requires public hearings before a vote on
constitutional amendments, and procedural delays introduced by
Harper have pushed debate back so far that it may be impossible to
pass the measure before the deadline.
   For many Quebecois in Montreal, Canada's second-largest city,
the arguments have worn thin and the endless debate over a document
thought signed and sealed in 1987 has led to widespread cynicism
and a rise in nationalist feelings.
   A poll published Thursday in the French-language newspaper La
Presse indicated that 57 percent of Quebecois favor sovereignty, up
slightly from 56 percent in March.
   But, unlike a decade ago when a referendum was held by the
separatist Parti Quebecois to determine the future of the province,
passion is missing.
   ``I think people have accepted that it (Meech Lake) won't pass
with a shrug,'' said Robert Gagnon, a computer systems specialist
for a Montreal insurance company.
   An exception to that feeling came from cabbie Roger Solari.
Asked about independence for Quebec, he responded with a vigorous
``Ah, oui!'' slapping the steering wheel for emphasis. ``They don't
want us. We're better off independent.''
   Premier Robert Bourassa has categorically rejected suggestions
for extending the Saturday deadline. ``There will be a profound
disappointment, sadness and much disillusionment in Quebec,'' he
said.
   Jean Chretien, leading candidate for the leadership of the
opposition Liberal Party, told the party's congress in Calgary that
failure of Meech Lake would not necessarily mean a breakup of
Canada.
   But Premier Frank McKenna of New Brunswick, once a strong
opponent of Meech Lake, predicted a wave of intolerance across
Canada if the deal fails.
   ``We will see waves of hatred taking place across our beloved
land,'' McKenna said. ``There will be alienation, and lots of it,
enough to go around for everyone.''

<HEAD>Lawmaker Blames Government for Death Threats Against Critic</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A conservative lawmaker Thursday blamed the
government for death threats made against a prominent critic, and
warned there could be ``a violent reaction'' if human rights abuses
by police are not curbed.
   The death threats directed against Jorge Castaneda, a prominent
journalist and intellectual, have provoked an uproar. Castaneda has
been an outspoken critic of the economic and political policies of
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party.
   The city council of Mexico City has demanded an investigation of
the threats. The U.S.-based Committee for the Protection of
Journalists wrote a letter to Salinas that said it is ``profoundly
worried'' about the threats.
   Cesar Coll, a federal lawmaker from the right-of-center
opposition National Action Party, said the government was trying to
intimidate Castaneda because he is one of its most prominent
critics.
   ``The government is to blame for these threats,'' Coll told a
news conference. ``If it doesn't gain control over the police,
there could be a violent reaction.''
   On Wednesday, the executive committee of the Institutional
Revolutionary Party condemned the threats against Castaneda. It
issued a statement calling them ``repugnant'' and adding that the
case would be a good test for the government's new human rights
commission.
   Earlier this week, Salinas called Castaneda from Tokyo, where
the president was making a state visit, to express his ``solidarity
in the face of this unacceptable incident.''
   Salinas also made public a letter he wrote to Castaneda saying
the threats go ``precisely against what I have maintained as an
invariable norm of conduct for my administration.''
   Last Friday, Castaneda's secretary said she was stopped by four
armed men, interrogated at gunpoint and warned that her employer
would be killed if he continued his activities.
   On Monday, she identified one of the men who threatened her as a
member of the Mexico City judicial police. On her way home from the
prosecutor's office, she said she was again threatened by an armed
man.
   Castaneda said he holds the government responsible for his
safety and that of his family.
   The incidents follow the release earlier this month of a report
by a human rights monitoring group that sharply criticizes abuses
by the police and security forces in Mexico.
   The report by the New York-based Americas Watch _ ``Human Rights
in Mexico: A Policy of Impunity'' _ said violent human rights
abuses have become institutionalized.
   ``This pattern of excessive violence and abuse can only mean
that either the Mexican government has adopted a policy of
tolerating such behavior, or it has lost control over its police,
security and prosecuting agencies,'' the report said.
   ``Torture and extra-judicial killings by federal and state
police and the country's security forces are disturbingly frequent
in Mexico,'' it said.
   Americas Watch cited several cases in which journalists had been
intimidated, kidnapped or murdered. The most notorious is the 1984
assassination of the outspoken columnist Manuel Buendia. The
Salinas administration has indicted the former head of the Mexican
equivalent of the FBI in the slaying.
   Castaneda has written for Newsweek, the Los Angeles Times and
the Mexican magazine Proceso. He also coauthored the recent book on
U.S.-Mexico relations, ``Limits to Friendship,'' with Robert Pastor
of Emory University in Atlanta.
   Castaneda, the son of a former Mexican foreign minister, is a
supporter of leftist opposition leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, leader
of the Democratic Revolutionary Party. Cardenas ran a strong second
to Salinas in the 1988 presidential election.
   Mexico's government and ruling party have long been accused
inside Mexico of using threats and violence to intimidate opponents
and election fraud to maintain the Institutional Revolutionary
Party's 61-year-old grip on power.
   The Castaneda incident coming on the heels of the Americas Watch
report has focused international attention on allegations of human
rights abuses.
   In the past, Americas Watch said such allegations had been
overlooked, saying this was ``more a testament to the Mexican
government's careful cultivation of its pro-human rights image than
its care to ensure that individual human rights are respected.''
   Other government critics have reported receiving death threats.
Norma Corona Sapien, the head of a state human rights commission in
the west coast state of Sinaloa, received similar threats before
she was gunned down on a street in the capital of Culiacan May 21.
   Salinas, who has pledged to end corruption and strong-arm
tactics by the ruling party, created the National Human Rights
Commission after the Corona slaying.

<HEAD>Gov't Agrees to Sell Big Development to Japanese Businessman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government agreed to sell a ritzy Texas real
estate development that was seized from a failed savings and loan
to a Japanese businessman for $61 million.
   The price for the Stonebridge Ranch is far below the $300
million it cost to develop, but within the $45 million-to-$85
million range expected, officials said.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. accepted the bid Wednesday
from Yukio Kitano of Osaka, Japan. The agency announced it would
recommend that a federal bankruptcy judge who has veto power over
the transaction approve the sale.
   The FDIC gained control of 6,230-acre development in 1988 when
it shut down Gibraltar Savings Association, one of the state's
largest thrifts. The development is in McKinney, north of Dallas.
   The government placed the development into bankruptcy to void a
controversial high-price management contract it had blamed for
stalling a sale of the property.
   Two other bids were received, but FDIC officials refused to
identify the bidders or the size of their offers.
   The FDIC said Kitano owns a majority stake in a bank in Honolulu.
   Stonebridge Ranch is one of the largest mixed-use developments
in the country; 270 homes already are occupied and 394 homesites
sold. There is zoning for a total of 27,500 homes, permits for 91
million square feet of retail, commercial, office, research and
industrial space.
   The development also includes two country clubs, with
championship-caliber golf courses, lakes, biking and horseriding
trails, tennis courts and other recreational facilities.

<HEAD>Salvadoran Peace Talks Suspended Twice over Armed Forces Issue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAXTEPEC, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peace talks between the Salvadoran
government and leftist rebels were suspended twice Thursday over
the thorny issue of impunity for the armed forces in human rights
cases.
   The talks, mediated by a U.N. envoy, entered their third day.
Negotiators want an accord to end El Salvador's 10-year-old civil
war, which has claimed an estimated 73,000 lives. Several previous
rounds ended without resolution.
   Col. Humberto Vargas, a member of the government negotiating
team, said he expected ``partial accords, not spectacular
results,'' would come out of the latest negotiations.
   The government has said progress depends on reaching an
agreement on a cease-fire, but the rebel Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front has insisted the issue of the armed forces be
resolved first.
   The rebels want the armed forces sharply reduced, members of the
right wing death squads purged, and punishment for those who
participated in political slayings. The squads are believed
responsible for thousands of civilian deaths. ``The talks were
suspended two times and were about to break off because of the
heated arguments we had over the issue of the armed forces, but the
U.N. representative brought us back to the negotiating table,'' a
rebel negotiator said on condition of anonymity.
   U.N. mediator Alvaro de Soto met separately with the rebel and
government delegations Thursday.
   ``We are working on political accords that are necessary to
arrive at negotiation of a cease-fire, and we have taken up the
issue of impunity proposed at the negotiating table,'' Soto said.
``It's logical for the situation to be difficult after 10 years of
war. ... There is progress, but it's minimal.''
   Vargas said Thursday that both sides were ``working to reach a
point of equilibrium on the issue of the armed forces so we can
move on to other issues.''
   Shafik Handal, a member of the rebel high command, said that if
the question of the armed forces is not resolved, ``it will be
difficult to move on.''
   The talks being held in the mountain resort of Oaxtepec, 40
miles from Mexico City, are the first since 1987 for the rebels and
rightist government led by Alfredo Cristiani.
   No Salvadoran officer has been convicted of a crime involving
politically motivated human rights abuse. The rebels want that
changed.
   They particularly want the government to bring to justice the
killers of Archbishop Oscar Romero, slain while saying Mass in
1980, and of six Jesuit priests shot to death in November.
   The decade-old civil war has turned El Salvador into the largest
recipient of U.S. aid in the Western Hemisphere.

   The United States faces a painful decision
between easing its opposition to forced repatriation of Vietnamese
``boat people'' or seeing them pushed back out to sea, perhaps to
die, because Southeast Asian countries are threatening to end
temporary asylum, Congress was told Thursday.
   Countries providing temporary ``first asylum'' refuge under a
year-old Geneva agreement have given the United States until July 1
to arrange new options for people screened out as ineligible for
resettlement, usually because they are fleeing poverty rather than
political persecution, said the State Department's refugee chief.
   Without waiting for the deadline, Malaysia has forced an
estimated 7,700 boat people back to sea, causing five reported
deaths, said Princeton N. Lyman, refugee programs director, in
testimony before the Asia-Pacific subcommittee of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee.
   ``We have joined others in calling upon the Malaysian government
to cease such push-offs immediately and to resume granting asylum
to all who seek it,'' Lyman added.
   The ultimatum from a Manila meeting of participating countries
last month threatens the worst crisis in a decade of Indochina
refugee relief, humanitarian organizations testified.
   ``We may be faced with choosing the lesser of two evils,'' said
subcommittee chairman Stephen Solarz, D-NY. ``The countries of
first asylum ... called upon the United States either to agree to
the mandatory return of non-refugees or provide another
alternative, such as a holding center for non-refugees.''
   ``It is now the 11th hour for the Vietnamese boat people,'' said
Rep. Hamilton Fish, R-N.Y.
   Fish and Rep. Chester Atkins, D-Mass., announced they are
reluctantly introducing a resolution that would support mandatory
repatriation of non-political refugees as a last resort, with
adequate screening and safeguards by the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees.
   A holding center for such refugees would become a magnet for
greater flows of boat people refugees and quickly fill to capacity,
Atkins said, especially if located on any U.S. territory.
   Lyman said the U.S. administration continues to oppose
involuntary return to Vietnam ``under present conditions'' in that
country. Answering questions, he said the July 1 deadline ``doesn't
necessarily mean'' first asylum for Vietnamese will be ended by all
countries, and he hopes they ``will hesitate and avoid a lot of
negative consequences.''
   Noting that the United States acquiesces to involuntary
repatriation to such countries as China, Haiti, El Salvador and
Guatemala but not Vietnam, Solarz called the policy
``intellectually incoherent.''

   In the age of AIDS, the Chicken Ranch
brothel is an island of safe sex in a sea of disease.
   Researchers spent most of the last year examining the results of
4,858 gonorrhea cultures, 1,333 blood tests for syphilis and 849
HIV antibody tests.
   The preliminary results, scheduled to be presented at the Sixth
International Conference on AIDS on Saturday: 20 positive gonorrhea
tests, all but one before 1985; no positive syphilis tests since
1983; and no positive HIV tests since AIDS antibody screening began
in 1986.
   That was the same year condom use became the law at all 35 legal
brothels in the state of Nevada.
   The study was conducted by researchers from the School of Public
Health at the University of California, Los Angeles.
   ``I think this represents a successful marriage _ wrong term _ a
successful collaboration between private industry and state
regulators in the state of Nevada,'' said Dr. Gary Richwald,
assistant professor in UCLA's Department of Community Health
Services, who led the $21,000 study funded by the Nevada Brothel
Association.
   The wrong results could have meant disaster for the ranch, but
it was a risk co-owner Russell Reade was willing to take.
   ``Along about 1985, when the AIDS epidemic really hit and was
really a news item, I really seriously thought that perhaps the
party was over,'' said the former high school biology teacher who
has co-owned the ranch since 1982. ``But with the protections we
offer with the mandatory testing and the mandatory condoms, I was
pleasantly surprised that business increased, and we've actually
had an increase every year.''
   Every week, the 21 ladies of the Chicken Ranch are screened for
gonorrhea; HIV and syphilis tests are done monthly. All tests are
state law. There have been no positive HIV results in any of
Nevada's 300-400 licensed prostitutes.
   ``I require that the working ladies of the Chicken Ranch go
directly from the lab where the test is administered to the Chicken
Ranch and wait for the test results after returning from any time
off whatsoever,'' Reade said. ``We agree that a lady is in complete
control in the brothel to mandate the condom. She may not be able
to exercise such complete control in her personal life, and there
is where she is probably at greater risk.''
   From 1982 to 1989, about 87,000 men visited the Chicken Ranch,
in Pahrump, Nev., about an hour outside of Las Vegas. Only 31 of
the 7,000 men who came to the brothel in the first half of this
year refused to use condoms.
   ``They're gentlemen about it. They just happen to have very
strong feelings about it,'' Reade said. ``They are graciously
refused service.''
   ``For many of the men coming to the Chicken Ranch brothel,
they're using condoms for the first time,'' Richwald said. ``I
think this demonstrates condom use is possible, successful, can be
intimate and is a behavior they might consider at home as well.''
   The ranch's employees tend to be white and in their 20s. All
fees are negotiated, and most women see about 15 clients a week for
a gross weekly income of about $3,000. Half of that goes to the
brothel.
   The owners make sure their employees know the latest techniques
to make safe sex erotic.

<HEAD>Army: Records of Stolen Art Probe Destroyed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENISON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army said it has thrown out all
records of its investigation into the World War II theft of German
medieval artworks that wound up in a small town in Texas.
   As a result, the Army may never know whether a former soldier
from Texas who died in 1980 was a suspect in the theft, an Army
spokeswoman told The Denison Herald in an interview published
Thursday.
   The artifacts, some of them stored in the vault of the First
National Bank in Whitewright, have been valued in the millions of
dollars by German art experts.
   A Lutheran church in Quedlinburg, East Germany, is suing to
recover the artwork from the bank and the late Joe T. Meador's
family.
   Meador is believed to have stolen the objects while an Army
lieutenant, and stashed them in his hometown about 60 miles north
of Dallas. He left the artifacts to a brother and sister.
   Army military police investigated the theft, but the file was
apparently destroyed in 1964 when records of all cases older than
15 years were purged, Barbara Parker, a spokeswoman at the U.S.
Army Crime Records Center in Fort Holabird, Md., told the Herald.
   Only records of historical interest survived the housecleaning,
Parker said.
   The Army abandoned the case in 1949 when Quedlinburg became part
of East Germany. Army spokesmen have said it is unclear whether the
military will reopen the case.
   The articles allegedly taken by Meador include a silver, ivory
and gold reliquary from the 9th or 10th century, a 10th century
Byzantine rock-crystal flask with sides formed like birds and an
ivory comb inlaid with precious stones.
   Meador's heirs, Jack Meador, 70, and Jane Cook, 58, said earlier
this week that their unoccupied farmhouse was ransacked Monday
night by burglars who mistakenly believed the treasure was there.
   The burglary was described in a motion filed by Meador and Ms.
Cook seeking a protective order to keep all parties in the lawsuit
from discussing the case in public. U.S. District Judge Sidney A.
Fitzwater denied the motion Tuesday.
   The bank had acknowledged the artifacts are in the vault.
Fitzwater has ordered the bank to allow representatives of the
church to inventory and photograph the artifacts.
   Denison is 70 miles north of Dallas.

   International organizations offered Iran
sympathy, supplies and financial aid Thursday to help it cope with
the devastation wrought by an earthquake that killed at least
25,000 people.
   Tens of thousands also were injured in the early morning temblor
that rocked northern Iran.
   At the United Nations, Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
expressed condolences to the Iranian government and the families of
the victims.
   Perez de Cuellar, in a message to Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani, said the U.N. system was ready to provide all possible
assistance.
   Its disaster relief coordinator dispatched an emergency team,
and an airlift of emergency supplies from U.N. warehouses was
undertaken in coordination with Iranian authorities, officials said.
   A statement from the U.N. Disaster Relief Organization in Geneva
said the most immediate needs were for medicine, medical supplies
and tents. Other needs include canned food, blankets, clothing,
vehicles and heavy-duty equipment.
   The organization was sending a senior officer and relief
coordination officer to the stricken areas, and a special task
force was established at the Iranian president's office to
coordinate relief, the U.N. said.
   The Iranian government already has allocated $14 million for
relief.
   In Brussels, the European Community agreed to donate $1.2
million to help send emergency relief equipment to the area, it was
announced.
   A spokesman for the League of Red Cross in Geneva said the
organization would have no comment on relief efforts until Friday
morning.
   But an American Red Cross official in Washington said, ``We're
attempting to raise money to send to the Red Crescent Society to
help buy tents, blankets, food, medical supplies and emergency
lighting.'' Red Crescent is the Islamic equivalent of the Red Cross.
   Spokesman Brian Ruberry said the organization was raising money
rather than shipping the supplies, and had established a toll-free
nationwide telephone number for people wanting to make
contributions.
   AmeriCares, based in New Canaan, Conn., said in a statement that
it was preparing to send containers of medicine and other relief
supplies to Iran via Hartford, Conn., ``as soon as clearance has
been received from the Iranian government to land our aircraft in
that country.''
   President Bush's administration offered humanitarian assistance
and sent a message of condolence to the government.
   ``We are saddened by the damage and the loss of life,''
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. ``We are also expressing our
willingness to provide appropriate humanitarian assistance should
it be requested.''
   The messages was delivered to Iran by another, unidentified
country because the United States has not had diplomatic relations
with Tehran since 1979.

   The Senate on Thursday rejected a move that
Democrats said would gut a proposed $2 billion program to encourage
construction of new and renovated housing for low-income people.
   The amendment was defeated on a 52-45 vote, largely along party
lines, as the Senate spent a fourth day debating a bill that would
overhaul federal housing policy.
   The housing bill faced a long list of other amendments. The
Senate concluded for the evening after Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, said progress had stalled and that debate would
resume Friday.
   Negotiations between Democratic sponsors and the Bush
administration, which has opposed major portions of the bill,
appeared to have broken down. Mitchell said he expected them to
resume Friday.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., who a day earlier said he was
optimistic about reaching agreement with the administration on the
bill, said he was never able to talk with Housing and Urban
Development Secretary Jack Kemp as he had expected.
   ``It's difficult to find out what an administration is really
thinking if they're unwilling to talk to you,'' Cranston said.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., pleaded with the Senate to accept
the amendment that would allow states and cities to use the $2
billion provided through the new Housing Opportunity Partnerships
program to help the poor with rental assistance as well as to build
or rehabilitate housing.
   ``If this amendment fails, we're not going to have a housing
bill,'' D'Amato said. ``... I don't know how we can come to an
agreement.''
   D'Amato and Republican supporters said it would give local
governments more flexibility.
   But Democratic opponents led by Cranston said the move was an
attack on the program to provide money for construction. He said
other provisions of the bill have money to provide the poor with
vouchers and other methods of rental assistance.
   ``The HOP program was carefully designed to expand the supply of
affordable housing, through rehabilitation, new construction and
acquisition,'' Cranston said. ``The requirements of tenant rental
assistance and the requirements of investment funds to provide more
housing are very different _ and the two activities need to be kept
separate.''
   The bill would provide a total of $17.6 billion for all housing
assistance, some $4 billion more than President Bush's budget asked
for.
   Among the stumbling blocks was disagreement over Kemp's proposal
to increase down-payment requirements for home purchasers who
obtain Federal Housing Administration loan guarantees, and make
other changes aimed at shoring up the financially endangered FHA
program.
   Also in dispute was Kemp's Home Ownership Opportunity for People
Everywhere, or HOPE, program, which would provide money to
encourage low-income tenants of public housing to purchase their
homes. Democrats included it in the bill, but with less money than
the administration wanted.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and the
German foreign ministers began talks Thursday on the international
aspects of German unification, 45 years after the Allies divided
the nation.
   Baker arrived in East Berlin on Thursday for separate talks with
Markus Meckel, the East German foreign minister, and West German
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher. At issue was a declaration
that would restore Germany's control of Berlin and set forth the
united nation's borders.
   The four victorious World War II Allies _ the United States, the
Soviet Union, Britain and France _ would sign the document, along
with East and West Germany.
   The toughest issues, however, would be set aside. These, U.S.
officials said, include the size of the German army and whether the
united country could be a member of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   Such issues concern the Soviet Union, which wants to keep
Germany out of NATO. But a senior U.S. official said Moscow's
``kitchen sink'' approach to the final settlement was not
acceptable to the Western Allies.
   Still, Meckel proposed that the 16 NATO and 7 Warsaw Pact
members issue a declaration ``saying they do not regard each other
as enemies and they wouldn't use any force against each other.''
   Meckel told reporters after he met with Baker that the
declaration would assure Moscow that NATO was not ``a hostile
alliance against the Soviet Union'' and assure the East Europeans,
as well.
   ``We haven't talked about the details,'' Meckel said.
   The idea initially was broached by the Soviets at the Washington
superpower summit in early June. Baker then took it up with the
NATO foreign ministers in Turnberry, Scotland, two weeks ago.
   Asked about the proposal, Baker did not reply directly.
   He said he had talked to Meckel about several subjects. ``Some
perhaps have promise, some do not,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher
said after meeting with Baker that the idea would be discussed
further.
   The Soviets are about to lose East Germany, their most powerful
ally, which will merge its economy with West Germany's on July 2.
Full incorporation is expected to follow, perhaps before the end of
the year.
   The Soviets are trying to slow the merger while seeking
assurances against a renewal of German militarism. At least 20
million Soviets died before Germany's defeat in World War II.
   The discussions about a German settlement will continue Friday.
   The occasion is another in a series of so-called
``two-plus-four'' meetings of the four World War II Allies and the
two Germanys.
   U.S. officials said they did not expect the declaration to be
completed at the one-day session. Another round is planned for July
17 in Paris.
   The four Allies have shared control of Berlin since the end of
World War II. The final settlement would return control of the city
to the Germans, who are expected to make it their capital.
   On the borders question, meanwhile, Baker is pushing for a
provision establishing that the country would include the territory
of East and West Germany plus Berlin _ and no more. Poland's
concern that Germany might try to recover land now part of Poland
is to be taken up at the Paris meeting.

<HEAD>France to Reward African Governments That Move to Democracy</HEAD>

   France will give more aid to African
governments that move toward democracy, President Francois
Mitterrand said Thursday at the close of a Franco-African summit.
   Mitterrand also excluded an immediate lifting of sanctions
imposed by France on South Africa, saying the ``threshold in the
disappearance of apartheid had not been reached.''
   French aid to African countries will continue as always, the
French president said.
   ``But it is obvious that this aid will be cooler toward those
acting in an authoritarian manner ... and more enthusiastic toward
those who take with courage this step toward democratization,''
Mitterrand said.
   The French president was flanked at the 16th annual summit by
Morocco's King Hassan II and President Omar Bongo of Gabon. Of the
36 nations present, 22 were represented by heads of state.
   Several nations, such as Gabon, have recently moved toward
political plurality following a wave of protests, similar to that
which swept Eastern Europe. But one-party states still predominate
in Africa.
   During the three-day summit, France announced it would halve
interest rates on loans to Gabon, Ivory Coast, Congo and Cameroon,
countries ranked as having intermediate incomes. He also announced
plans to increase aid to less developed countries.
   The French president said African nations were ``cruelly
installed in this infernal cycle of debt-underdevelopment.''
   He said he would urge other nations to aid Africa at next week's
European Community summit in Dublin and next month's summit of the
seven top Western industrialized countries in Houston, Texas.
   Senegalese President Abdou Diouf said in a radio interview
Thursday that African governments moving toward genuine democracy
should receive bonus payments on top of continued foreign aid.
   ``I think each state must go toward multiparty politics,'' Diouf
said. ``If they don't do it now on their own initiative, they will
be obliged to do it tomorrow in less favorable conditions, under
pressure.''
   Many of Africa's French-speaking countries in recent months have
experienced anti-government protests and demands for multiparty
elections.
   The three-day summit was held at La Baule, a resort on the
Brittany coast.

   If 29 senators have their way, gold-colored,
11-sided dollar coins commemorating Christopher Columbus will soon
be jingling in Americans' pockets.
   However, the Bush administration and the congressional General
Accounting Office say the coins will simply occupy space in
government vaults unless Congress simultaneously moves to end the
availability of dollar bills.
   The government could save an average of $381 million a year by
minting dollar coins, L. Nye Stevens of the GAO told the Senate
Banking Committee on Wednesday.
   But, he warned, ``We think these savings are unlikely to occur
unless Congress and the administration jointly resolve not only to
eliminate the dollar note but also stand up to a negative public
reaction that should be fully anticipated.''

   The world's biggest convention on AIDS
began under siege by thousands of angry demonstrators frustrated
that many of them are likely to die of the disease before
scientists learn to control it.
   Police said 80 demonstrators were arrested Wednesday, and
speakers at the opening ceremonies in the evening repeatedly
alluded to the protesters.
   While conference participants were entertained by the San
Francisco Gay Mens' Chorus in the heavily guarded Moscone Center, a
crowd outside chanted: ``We're here. We're queer. And we demand
access.''
   About half the estimated 50,000 gay men in San Francisco are
infected with the AIDS virus, epidemiologists say.

   President Bush says he's willing to
resume the newly suspended talks with the Palestine Liberation
Organization if Yasser Arafat denounces a recent foiled terrorist
attack on an Israeli beach.
   The president, who announced the suspension Wednesday, said the
PLO ``has not provided a credible account of this incident,'' in
which a PLO affiliate group launched a guerrilla attack on the
civilian-filled beach near Tel Aviv.
   ``We've given the PLO ample time to deal with this issue,'' but
PLO leader Arafat has refused to denounce it or discipline the
leader of the group, the radical Palestine Liberation Front, Bush
said at a news conference during a one-day political trip to
Alabama and North Carolina.
   The president said the administration is willing to resume the
talks if Arafat fulfills those conditions. Bush said he believes
the 18-month U.S.-PLO dialogue has encouraged moderation within the
PLO.

   West Germany plans to give Moscow more
than $3 billion in credit to support development of an open market
in the Soviet Union, a Bonn-based newspaper reported today.
   Die Welt said that the credit had been negotiated between a
consortium of banks headed by Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank with
the Soviet Union's Foreign Trade Bank.
   ``The Soviet government, as support for its efforts to develop
open market elements, will received a credit of more than 5 billion
marks ($3 billion),'' the newspaper said.
   According to Die Welt, the West German government is sponsoring
the credit and has already approved it.

   No one wants to be the abortion doctor in
North Dakota.
   The only doctor in the state who performed abortions retired
earlier this year. None of the state's 1,200 doctors has come
forward to take the place of Dr. Robert Lucy, a obstetrician and
gynecologist. He predicts no one will.
   ``Peer pressure from colleagues is the main reason,'' said Lucy,
who practiced in Jamestown, 100 miles west of here. ``They're also
afraid of public pressure.''
   Abortions still are performed at a women's clinic in Fargo, but
it has to fly doctors in from neighboring Minnesota.

   Move over, Rover. This is cat city.
   They're everywhere. Pyramids have cats. Apartment stairwells
have them, and offices, and hospital examination rooms. Cats prowl
hotel lobbies and restaurants. Theaters have cats, and bazaars have
cats.
   Even an airplane had one. It made front-page headlines: ``Cat
Forces Plane Back to Cairo.''
   The story tried to explain how a cat found its way into the
cockpit of an Air Sinai flight headed for Sharm el-Sheik on the Red
Sea.
   Once airborne, the cat made a great fuss about risking one of
its nine lives in such a manner. Its howls caused ``pandemonium
among the 31 passengers,'' the article said, forcing the pilot to
turn back.
   Such cat stories abound in Egypt, where felines have a storied
history. Cats were worshiped even before there were pharaohs, and
remained sacred long after the pharaohs were gone.
   The singing cats of El-Gomhouriya, a theater where operas are
performed, are famous throughout the city.
   Hassan Kamy, Egypt's leading tenor, has been upstaged several
times.
   ``It was the last act of `La Boheme','' he said in an interview.
``I was holding the dying Mimi in my arms. The orchestra was
silenced for the finale. A cat walked onto stage.
   ``At first, the audience simply giggled quietly, but the cat
took a long time getting across the stage and I kept holding the
dying Mimi. Finally, the audience was in hysterics.''
   Then there is Kamy's tale of two cats, another opera and a lamp:
   The lamp ``was a stage prop,'' he said. ``All was fine until two
cats decided to walk onstage and go to sleep at the base.
   ``It was act three, a love duet. You could feel the emotion in
the air, the audience getting hotter. But so were the cats.
   ``They chose this moment to begin a romantic interlude under the
lamp. The higher the diva sang, the higher they sang. ... The next
day, newspapers asked, `Which had the greater range, the soprano or
the the cats?'''
   Cats made another artistic headline last year by disrupting an
Italian group's performance at an Experimental Theater Festival.
   The avant-garde play was set on a beach and the actors insisted
the stage be covered with sand a foot deep.
   Midway through the performance, cats wandered onto the stage and
began doing what cats often do in sand. The actors were horrified;
the audience howled.
   ``What can you do?'' Kamy said. ``Nobody will touch a cat. Even
now, in the villages, people are scared of them, afraid to harm
them or anger them. Cats are sacred in Egypt.''
   In ancient times, a favorite goddess was the cat Bastet, sleek
and sensual.
   Short-haired, long-legged house cats, domesticated from wilder
strains, are depicted in tomb paintings enjoying life's better
things. They were much loved in life, much mourned at death.
   About 2,000 years ago, worshipers buried mummified cats near
Bastet's sacred temples.
   Cat mummies, embalmed and wrapped in intricate bandages, were
dedicated by the thousands. Archaeologists uncovered 300,000 in one
temple.
   Even cat fetuses were mummified sometimes, and occasionally
buried with a tiny mouse or ball of yarn.
   Mummified or live, ancient cats never lost their special status.
An official record tells of a Roman soldier in Alexandria who
accidentally killed a cat. A mob killed the soldier.
   Owning an Egyptian cat was such a mark of prestige that
Phoenician and Greek traders, and Christian monks, did big business
exporting them to the Far East and around the Mediterranean area,
especially to Italy.
   Trade ended when a place had enough cats to start its own
colony. Thus did Rome, not Cairo, gain fame as the world's cat
capital.
   Islamic invasions in the seventh century and afterward disrupted
many aspects of life in Egypt, but Moslems viewed the whiskered
pets as good omens that protected home and family.
   The prophet Mohammed is said to have been fond of cats. One
story says he awoke from a nap and wanted to get out of bed, but
found a cat asleep on his robe. Rather than wake the cat, he cut
the robe.
   In the Middle Ages, while their cousins were being killed in
Europe as agents of black magic, Egyptian cats were pampered, as
usual.
   In the 13th century, Islamic rulers of Cairo established a
special garden for stray cats where attendants served them food,
with pomp, each afternoon.
   The tradition of feeding strays remained strong in the 19th
century. English travelers wrote home that special servants were
assigned each afternoon to feed street cats, which were
well-mannered despite questionable pedigrees.
   Cairo's cats still are fed well. Even poor peasants share their
bread with stray cats, beckoning them with the pet name Mish-Mish _
Arabic for apricot, the most common color of Egyptian cats.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Feinstein, the young pianist-singer, is
best known as a leading interpreter of the music of George and Ira
Gershwin. But he'd like to interview Elvis Costello, rocker by
trade.
   That may sound like a clash of cultures, but it ain't
necessarily so, says Susan Lester, TV producer by trade.
   ``Michael is going to be a correspondent on some pieces,'' she
says, ``and I'd like to put him together with the kind of artist
you wouldn't normally see him with.''
   Lester's show is the ``Arts &amp; Entertainment Revue,'' a weekly
one-hour cable series that quietly opened for business last spring.
It's a show of arts and letters in a time of bottom lines and
ciphers.
   Shown twice Friday nights on the Arts &amp; Entertainment Network,
and repeated again Saturday evenings and Sunday mornings, ``Revue''
is close in spirit to ``Omnibus,'' the acclaimed cultural series
that appeared on all three networks in the 1950s and '60s.
   By sheer coincidence, Lester also was senior producer of the
last network incarnation of ``Omnibus,'' a 1988 special she did for
ABC News, where she worked 10 years before moving to cable in
January.
   The major difference in ``Revue,'' hosted by Eric Burns, is that
it tries to be timely, a cultural newsmagazine.
   Each program is a showcase for art, music, films, television,
theater, dance, pop culture and literature, says Lester, brought
over from ABC by former ABC vice president Av Westin, executive
producer of ``Revue.''
   But current cultural news also is a key element, says Lester,
who doesn't finish each show until two days before it airs. ``We're
not trying to be news up to the second,'' she says. ``But we
wouldn't want to be a whole week behind.''
   As an example, she says, one show did what amounts to a primer
on the flap touched off by the Robert Mapplethorpe homoerotic photo
exhibits when that controversy was making headlines.
   This summer, the larger topic of art and obscenity in modern
times will get the once-over, she says.
   ``Revue,'' which costs less than $150,000 a show, has an initial
26-week order. The Arts &amp; Entertainment Network, which serves 44
million homes, started airing the show May 4.
   The debut episode spotlighted Broadway producer Harold Prince,
who has a record 16 Tony Awards, reporting on his efforts to keep
musical theater alive. The Neville Brothers showed off the New
Orleans Jazz Festival in the next show.
   In another edition, Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca reminisced about
``Your Show of Shows.'' There also was a report on an unusual kind
of rock video _ with closed-captioning for the hearing-impaired.
   Other segments have included veteran dancer Edward Villella
conducting a tour of his alma mater, the School of American Ballet;
a story on a PBS special saluting the music of the late ``Sesame
Street'' composer Joe Raposo; and a piece on a new home-video
offering, ``Who's Afraid of Opera?,'' designed for kids and hosted
by Joan Sutherland.
   Tonight's show has Feinstein singing four little-known Gershwin
songs, including a beautiful ballad, ``Will You Remember Me?,''
that he says originally was written as an uptempo song.
   It was cut from a Gershwin musical, ``Lady Be Good,'' and has
gone unheard until now, says Feinstein, who for six years worked as
an archivist for the late Ira Gershwin, the lyric-writing half of
the Gershwin brothers.
   Feinstein, who appeared on Lester's ``Omnibus'' special in 1988,
is far removed from the world of rock.
   His is the world of the fine old standards and lush
orchestrations that were revived in Woody Allen's ``Manhattan'' and
again in ``When Harry Met Sally ...''
   But he doesn't think it odd that as a guest correspondent he
might eventually interview Elvis Costello, whom he met this year.
For starters, one Costello album features a cover of ``My Funny
Valentine.''
   ``He was telling me about how he was influenced by Peggy Lee and
Frank Sinatra records, and by the lyrics of Ira Gershwin,''
Feinstein says. ``A lot of (rock) artists are inspired by the Old
Guard ... I hear that intermittently.''
   Producer Lester doesn't find it odd, either, to have the sort of
show in which, say, Monet and Madonna, or Dick Tracy and E.L.
Doctorow, can peacefully coexist.
   It's all part of life's rich cultural parade, she says, ``and
none of it is mutually exclusive. ... I don't think people divide
them up that way.''

<HEAD>Diplomats in Syria Go Shopping in Lebanon by Convoy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA ABU-NASR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHTAURA, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Every day, convoys of bulletproof cars
roll into east Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, home ground of Shiite Moslem
extremists, with Syrian security men on guard against kidnappers.
   The passengers are Europeans based in Damascus. They are going
shopping.
   Some of the diplomats, U.N. officials, businessmen and oil
workers have spent thousands of dollars at a time in the Ghazali
supermarket for luxury foods and other items virtually unobtainable
in economically troubled Syria.
   Off the highway, 20 miles northeast of Chtaura, is Baalbek, an
ancient Roman city that has become a stronghold of the pro-Iranian
Shiite fundamentalists of Hezbollah, the Party of God.
   Hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella group for Shiite
extremists who hold most of the 16 Westerners missing in Lebanon.
Some of the hostages have been reported held in the Bekaa at
various times.
   The supermarket, run by five Lebanese-American brothers, is
amply stocked with good meat, smoked salmon, shrimp, French wines
and fruit, not to mention salt, toilet paper, computers and washing
machines.
   ``They have everything you can't get in Syria,'' a Canadian
diplomat said.
   Most of the shoppers feel the dozen or so Syrian army
checkpoints along the highway, the main route between Beirut and
Damascus, are enough protection from kidnappers during the one-hour
drive over the mountains.
   ``As long as you stick to the main highway, there's no
problem,'' said Frans Ptuyt, a Dutch diplomat.
   Another Western diplomat, who asked that his name be withheld,
said: ``Chtaura's as far as we're allowed to go in Lebanon.''
   Plainclothes Syrian security men are posted inside the store to
make sure no one parks a car bomb outside or tries to to grab one
of the visitors. A Syrian checkpoint is just 100 yeards away.
   ``The area around here's as safe as Damascus,'' said Hasan
Ghazali, one of the owners.
   Shoppers in the convoys are from Canada, Austria, Scandinavia,
Eastern Europe, Japan, China, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Libya, Arab
nations, Iran and the families of high-ranking Syrians.
   American, British, Australia and French diplomats are banned by
their governments from crossing into Lebanon because scores of
foreigners have been kidnapped since 1984.
   The Ghazalis made a videotape of shelves crammed with goods from
all over the world, Hasan said, so the diplomats ``can do their
shopping at home. ... They send their Syrian or Lebanese staffers
to get what they want.''
   He said the U.S. Embassy sent Syrian personnel with long
shopping lists for parties it gave for former President Jimmy
Carter when he visited Damascus this year.
   Hasan and his brothers, who lived in the United States for 20
years before opening the store in 1980, greet customers at the door
with coffee or tea.
   Their domain is a gastronome's paradise: exotic sauces from
China, lime pickle from Pakistan, poppadums from India, coconut
milk from Thailand, flatbread from Norway and caviar from the
Soviet Union.
   In the freezers are shrimp from Oman and Kuwait, salmon from
Norway, Senagalese squid and fish from Argentina.
   There are French champagne, Russian vodka, Puerto Rican rum,
Mexican tequila. The brothers even sell American root beer.
   Out-of-season fruits are flown in regularly, including
watermelons from Sudan, mangoes from India and Africa, South
American papayas and grapes, dates from Tunisia.
   American, British, French and German newspapers and magazines
are stacked at the news stand.
   Everything comes through illegal Lebanese ports run by Moslem
militias.
   Nadim Ghazali said an ambassador bought $3,000 worth of cognac
and wine not long ago and another spent $1,200 for cheese, wine and
fruit.

<HEAD>Hudson River Riverkeeper Pursues Polluters</HEAD>

   John Cronin uses the same tools against
polluters that his medieval forebears used against poachers:
vigilance and cunning.
   But the Hudson's modern-day riverkeeper also wields two more
weapons: outrage and lawsuits.
   The Hudson, he says, is ``supposed to be ours. ... And I'm not
going to be a chump for GE, Exxon or the city of New York, who
think they can take it away from me, my children or any kid on the
street who wants to go to the river with a fishing pole.''
   So in 1983, when Cronin discovered that Exxon's tankers were
emptying their ballasts off Dutchess and Ulster counties and then
refilling them with fresh water to sell in water-poor Aruba, he
took the giant oil company to court. Exxon forked over a
half-million dollars in settlement.
   So has he taken on New York City in a slew of suits over its
sloppy handling of its water system.
   And so he defends the 315-mile waterway with an almost ferocious
protectiveness, using a specially built 25-foot vessel to
investigate reports of illegal discharges or catch big ships
poaching river water.
   He skulks around dumps and along the riverbanks, taking
pictures, gathering evidence. But ``he spends more time in court
than on the river,'' says Robert Boyle, his boss.
   ``At first, he would say things I considered outrageous,''
recalls Robert F. Kennedy Jr., son of the late attorney general and
the legal counsel for the Hudson River Fisherman's Association,
Cronin's employer.
   ``He's been right so much of the time, he's like a Cassandra,''
says Kennedy.
   A children's book has been written about Cronin. Warner Bros. is
planning a commercial film about his exploits as an environmental
knight errant, and a British crew did a documentary about his work.
   His success has led to the creation of a Long Island soundkeeper
and a San Francisco baykeeper. He's been working with New York and
New Jersey to create a New York harborkeeper.
   Such success would have been considered unlikely in 1983 when
Cronin took the job.
   He was 32, and had worked at various times and places as a
dancer, roofer, dishwasher, book salesman, political aide and
fisherman. He didn't set foot on a boat until he was 30. He grew up
in Yonkers _ a major Hudson city _ but admits he was barely aware
of the river.
   Then, in the early 1970s, Cronin encountered Pete Seeger, who
was trying to alert people to pollution on the Hudson.
   Cronin signed on to the campaign. After a few weeks, the other
volunteers drifted away and it was just Seeger and Cronin.
   ``Pretty soon, he's an environmentalist,'' Seeger says.
   And pretty soon, he was joining with others who contended the
Tuck tape company of Beacon lacked permits for all its discharges.
Cronin testified before a federal grand jury, and the company
pleaded guilty to violating the Clean Water Act.
   He went on to work for U.S. Rep. Hamilton Fish, R-N.Y. and for
the state Assembly Committee on Environmental Conservation, where
he helped investigate the U.S. Army's involvement in the
contamination of Love Canal.
   But after a while, he got tired of ``sitting in a building in
Albany, in a suit, watching the rain fall on windows that didn't
open.''
   As Cronin tells it, he planned to take to the road and fish in
the Chesapeake. He was cleaning his truck at a friend's house in
Garrison, not far from the river, when he put his arm through a
storm door.
   Arm in a sling, he couldn't go anywhere. That's when Robert
Boyle, head of the Hudson River Fisherman's Association, offered
him the riverkeeper's job.
   It was Boyle's idea to resurrect the medieval tradition. A
Hudson riverkeeper was appointed in the 1970s and held the title
briefly before quitting; the post was vacant until Cronin came
along.
   By the time Cronin joined up in 1983, the fisherman's
association had a respectable track record of inducing polluters to
pay into a Hudson River Foundation to study and maintain the river.
   Boyle discovered an old law prohibiting discharges in the river,
which he used to start a Bag a Polluter program.
   It was the association's determination to save the striped bass
that helped put a halt Westway, a massive highway and redevelopment
project that was planned for Manhattan's West Side. And it was
HRFA's research that pulled the plug on Con Edison's proposed
pumped storage generator project at Storm King Mountain.
   Boyle continues to marvel at his success in bringing Exxon to
justice _ ``He wiped the floor with Exxon. The federal government
couldn't do it, but he did.''
   Then, Con Edison agreed to do something about its Indian Point 2
nuclear power plant sucking in fish. Westchester County was cited
for contempt of court for failing to properly close its dump site.
Cronin brought a half-dozen suits against the town of Newburgh for
illegal discharges.
   Not everyone approves. Robert Kirkpatrick, a former Newburgh
town supervisor, thinks Cronin isn't acting for the river, but for
himself.
   ``I envision John Cronin saying, `Lord, step aside. The Hudson
River is mine. You can have the rest of the world.' He sees himself
as the infinite being of the Hudson River,'' says Kirkpatrick.
   Kirkpatrick accuses Cronin of harassment. His aim, Kirkpatrick
says, is to gain publicity and to raise money to fund the
fisherman's association through settlements; his targets,
Kirkpatrick says, actually are friends of the river.
   But Boyle defends the riverkeeper's knack for publicity.
   ``He's put a legal focus on the river,'' Boyle says, ``and a
sustained focus on the river.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ They're the people who have lost jobs and homes,
gone hungry and suffered illness, endured beatings or lived with
disabilities. They've been scarred by foster care, harassed at the
office or traumatized by illegal abortions. They're the people who
testify before congressional hearings, the people who put a human
face on cold statistics.

   Peggy Adams is an expert in raising children
and pulling together ends that don't quite meet. Hunger is no
stranger in her household.
   ``I have seen my children's bodies stop growing like they
should, and I pray it's not their brains as well,'' Mrs. Adams said
earlier this year at a Senate Budget Committee hearing on federal
food and nutrition programs.
   It was an emotional moment.
   ``These senators were glued to their chairs and listening to
every word intently,'' Jeff Coleman, a senior income analyst for
the committee, said later. ``You could see on the spot that people
were being affected. The questions they asked were very, very
thoughtful.''
   Capitol Hill hearings are often characterized by the relentless
recitation of government statistics, the polite drone of think tank
researchers, the familiar arguments of professional lobbyists.
   Even the most sensitive lawmakers can become numbed. That's when
it's time to bring on the victims.
   They're the people who have lost jobs and homes, gone hungry and
suffered illness, endured beatings and lived with disabilities.
They've been scarred by foster care, harassed at the office and
traumatized by illegal abortions.
   ``They're very useful because they're real. They take all the
studies and statistics and make them personal,'' says Rep. George
Miller, D-Calif., whose Select Committee on Children, Youth and
Families showcases victims of everything from domestic violence to
gang warfare.
   Though some may relive their agonies and humiliations to no
avail, the consensus is that any cause is strengthened by the
testimony of an ordinary person with no ax to grind.
   Advocacy and research groups ``certainly have a place and a
role,'' says Judith Lichtman, president of the Women's Legal
Defense Fund. ``But very often real-world hardships are more
persuasive.''
   Lichtman's group led the fight for a bill guaranteeing unpaid,
job-protected leave for employees needed at home.
   Despite the prospect of a presidential veto, Congress recently
passed the job-leave bill after three years of hearings and a
parade of people forced out of their jobs by births, adoptions or
medical emergencies.
   One man testified was assigned to a night shift at a doughnut
bakery although he had told his boss he had to drive his infant
daughter to a Washington hospital that night. She was scheduled for
heart surgery the next day. ``I am no hero,'' said David Wilt of
York, Pa. ``I am just a working man who was fired because he loved
his kids.''
   A woman from Charleston, S.C., claimed she was assured she could
return to her job at a retail store after a doctor-ordered medical
leave during a difficult pregnancy. But when she returned six weeks
after having the baby, she said she was told no jobs were
available. ``It hurt,'' said Liberia Johnson. ``My family needed
the income.''
   Dexter Manley, a linebacker for the Washington Redskins at the
time, was asked last year to discuss his learning disability at a
hearing. When he realized he could not read his prepared statement,
he broke down and cried before a battery of television cameras.
Manley was later suspended from professional football for using
drugs.
   At hearings on a bill expanding federal child care programs, a
bereaved couple haltingly recalled the death of their child in
unlicensed day care and a police officer told of finding two
children, left alone by a mother desperate to hold onto her job,
dead inside a dryer.
   Senators heard unusually graphic testimony this year at a
hearing on an abortion-rights bill. One member of the audience
fainted as witnesses described their illegal abortions and
self-induced miscarriages.
   Aides who orchestrate these hearings say politicians find it
difficult to be argumentative or ideological when a victim is
sitting in front of them.
   If a woman says she thwarted the law and risked her health to
get an illegal abortion, ``that decision-making process is
something that's hard to second-guess,'' said Kelly Signs, an aide
to Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio).

   Diane Shust, a Miller aide, said one House member tried to take
on a witness at a hearing on the ``sandwich generation'' _ people
who have to raise kids and care for ailing parents at the same time
_ and got nowhere.
   ``She just fired back at him. She slashed his theories to
shreds,'' Shust recalled. ``There was no way he could counter.
There was the expert sitting in front of him.''
   The perfect victim _ someone who is genuine, articulate and
sympathetic _ often surfaces in a newspaper story, a letter to a
lawmaker or a list kept by an advocacy group.
   Signs, who organized the Senate abortion-rights hearing, said
all the witnesses who told personal stories had already done so at
least once before in a public forum. She said it is hard to find
women willing to talk about long-ago abortions.
   ``They were not legal and were done under secretive conditions.
There may be members of their family who don't know about it,''
Signs said.
   Most advocacy groups can readily point congressional aides
toward people who have experienced the problem they want to
illuminate. And some go even further. The Maryland Food Committee
of Baltimore has developed a ``talent pool'' of sorts _ a stable of
eloquent poor people regularly dispatched to press conferences,
meetings and hearings.
   Coleman said the Baltimore group came up with six or seven
possible witnesses for the Senate hunger hearing in February. The
two chosen were Adams, a white woman with nine children, and Mary
Tamper, a black woman with two children.
   Adams said her family lost its income when she separated from
her husband, who made $55,000 a year as an engineer. He was jailed
on child abuse charges. Tamper's husband, whose annual salary was
$30,000, died of leukemia. She said she had to give up her
teacher's aide job and move the family in with her mother.
   Coleman said the two women, forced to rely on a variety of
federal programs to feed their kids, were picked with an eye toward
breaking stereotypes.
   ``Both had been middle class,'' he said. ``We felt that was a
strong message. There are so many myths about who poor people are _
minorities with lots and lots of kids, on welfare and food stamps
for years. We felt it was important not to perpetuate those myths.''
   From Coleman's viewpoint, the hearing was a success. He said its
major recommendations _ to expand food stamps and a nutrition
program for mothers and children _ won the support of both chairman
Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., and Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., the senior GOP
member of the panel. The extra money may be added to the 1990 farm
bill.
   Lichtman said victim witnesses also helped secure passage of a
1988 fair housing law.
   When women described being denied housing because they had kids,
``that helped make the case about why we needed to prohibit
discrimination against families with children,'' said Lichtman.
   She said the same dynamics were at work when the Voting Rights
Act was extended in 1982. ``People were brought in from Alabama and
Georgia and talked about what it was like to be disenfranchised or
never enfranchised,'' Lichtman said. ``That helped get the law
reauthorized.''
   Even the strongest testimony, however, does not always convert
lawmakers or alter the shape of public policy.
   For example, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, a strong abortion foe,
heartened some in the audience at the wrenching abortion-rights
hearing by saying he was ``rapidly coming to the conclusion that we
have to do more with family planning.'' But he still opposes a
long-sought renewal of the federal grant program for family
planning groups, because he believes they're too enmeshed in
providing abortion counseling and services.
   Lawmakers sympathized with witnesses who said they'd been fired
for taking a couple of weeks off while their children were
hospitalized or dying, and that may be part of the reason Congress
passed a job-leave bill. But the testimony failed to impress Bush,
who says the government shouldn't force employers to offer any
particular benefit.
   And foster children continue to suffer neglect and abuse despite
a little boy's poignant testimony in 1987.
   Marcia Lowry, the ACLU attorney who accompanied the boy to that
hearing, said at the time that agencies were not meeting federal
requirements to monitor foster kids, find permanent homes for them
or provide services to preserve their families. She also alleged an
almost complete lack of federal supervision.
   What has happened since then?
   ``Things have gotten worse,'' said Lowry, director of the ACLU's
Children's Rights Project.

   New Kids often receive the same criticism as Elvis Presley, who
sang black performers' songs and became far more famous than those
who first performed them, such as Big Mama Thornton and ``Hound
Dog.'' But he paid to cut his first record, in the style he liked
to sing, as a present for his mother.
   Wahlberg says the New Kids grew up listening to black radio
stations in Boston. ``I respect the roots of the music I perform,''
he said. ``I feel like I'm not stealing it. The music I do is music
I grew up listening to.''
   Adolescent girls loved Elvis in the 1950s, the Beatles in the
'60s and the Rolling Stones in the '70s; now they adore the New
Kids.
   But times have changed. Drugs and promiscuity are no longer in.
The New Kids sing about romance, lasting love and self-reliance.
Wahlberg says from the stage, ``Thank you for staying drug free.''
   Three books about the band are on paperback best-seller lists,
and fans salivate for every nugget about the quintet's personal
lives. Wahlberg isn't in love at the moment. Jonathan Knight has
the same girlfriend he had before the group started.
   The story of New Kids on the Block dates back to 1985 in Boston
where Maurice Starr worked. He was a man of ideas as well as a
facile songwriter, and had put together groups before, none meeting
with wild success. First he thought he and his brothers could be
another Jackson 5. Then he heard four young singers called the New
Edition, signed them and shepherded them through their first album.
They sued him for their release and won, on the basis that they
were minors when they signed.
   Starr put together a trio and managed a funk quartet. Next he
had the idea that a white group, singing music like the New
Edition, with choreography like the Motown groups in their heyday,
could appeal to white as well as the New Edition's black listeners.
He found four boys in Boston high schools, none of them aiming
toward a show business career. He found 12-year-old Joe McIntyre
last, younger and smaller than the rest, the Michael Jackson of the
latter-day Jackson 5 idea he never abandoned.
   New Kids wasn't an overnight success. Its first record was
marketed by Columbia Records to black radio, which wasn't crazy
about it. A station in Tampa, Fla., aimed at white listeners picked
up on ``Please Don't Go, Girl'' from the second album, ``Hangin'
Tough,'' in March 1988, and the group took off.
   Starr, however, isn't resting on his laurels. He put together a
trio, Perfect Gentlemen, which opened New Kids' shows in the winter
tour. ``They're 12, 11 and 13,'' Knight says. ``Just having them
around brings back a lot of memories, stuff they're going through
now that we went through. Their fans are younger than ours. We have
fans from 4 to grandmothers but predominately it's 13 to 18.''
   On this summer's tour, Perfect Gentlemen will open again, along
with Tommy Page, who co-wrote his single ``I'll Be Your
Everything'' with two of the New Kids, and the latest protege,
16-year-old Rick Wes, whom Starr thinks can become another Elvis.
   New Kids on the Block are prisoners of their own fame when
they're on the road, but Jonathan Knight says he doesn't mind. ``We
can't leave the hotel because it's so crazy outside. We usually
sleep most of the day, wake up around 2 and get dressed and lounge
around. The sound check is usually around 4. After the show we'll
all party pretty much all night, eating and watching a movie. It
depends. Sometimes we'll go crash in somebody else's room or in our
own.''
   If the next concert is in a different town, they'll sometimes
get on the bus and travel all night.
   ``We sightsee out the window, that's about it,'' Jonathan said.
``We have our own buses custom built for us, with beds and TVs and
bathrooms and microwaves. We buy microwave pizzas and pre-made
stuff.
   ``Everywhere we go, girls are out in front. We have jealous
boyfriends pull up in front of our houses at 3 in the morning,
screaming at the top of their lungs. We learn to live with it. The
good things far outweigh the bad things.''
   When the first album didn't sell hugely, Jonathan said, ``Our
manager (Starr) was telling us we have to wait our turn. As long as
we keep working hard and doing the best we can do, our dreams will
come true. He's always positive, about everything.''
   During the two-week vacation before going to Europe, Wahlberg
worked on producing two new groups, the North Side Boys and Marky
Mark and the Funky Bunch, the latter his 18-year-old brother, Mark,
who was in New Kids for six months then dropped out because he was
more interested in basketball. Wahlberg also has three sisters and
four brothers older than himself.
   During those two weeks, Jonathan worked in his yard until 4 a.m.
``I've got those night-owl eyes,'' he says. ``I was out there,
putting in a pond, planting bushes, getting the yard ready. Me and
Jordan just bought a house for our family.'' They have two sisters
and two more brothers at home. ``They're not jealous. They know God
carved out my life to do what I'm doing and they have their special
place in life to fulfill their dreams.
   ``We all still live with our families. We want to have our
families benefit from what we've accomplished. I helped one sister
buy a car. Donnie bought a house and Danny, I believe, bought his
parents' house from them and redid it for them. Joe still lives in
an apartment building with his mom.''

   Technology has changed much for midwives
since Edwin W. Edwards, decades away from the governor's mansion,
drove his mother down the back roads of central Louisiana to
deliver babies.
   But Kathy Acree, one of Louisiana's seven licensed midwives,
shares much with Agnes Brouillette Edwards, including the
willingness to take trade when clients can't pay cash.
   ``She did 1,500 deliveries in her day,'' said Mrs. Acree, who
has visited Mrs. Edwards, 88. ``She had notebooks with the date,
the baby's name, the parents' names and what they paid her. It
would usually be a dozen eggs, a chicken. One time she got some
shoes for her son.''
   Mrs. Acree, 40, and her partner, Alicia Abrin, charge $1,000 for
a delivery _ one-third to one-quarter the cost of an uncomplicated
hospital delivery. The husband of one woman who couldn't pay cash
landscaped the yard of the Acree house; another painted two rooms.
   The money or barter covers prenatal care, delivery, and two
appointments after birth.
   Mrs. Acree teaches clients how to sterilize sheets, towels and
baby clothes by baking them in the oven _ a technique Mrs. Edwards
used to sterilize bandages and gauze pads, according to her
daughter, Dorothy Isbell of Baton Rouge.
   ``You're talking about the days before antibiotics, you're
talking about the days before blood transfusions, you're talking
about the days when Cesarean section was fraught with hazards,''
said Mrs. Acree. ``Those midwives as a result became very skilled
at breech deliveries, at twin deliveries, at triplet deliveries _
because they had to.
   ``I would do a breech if it was coming and I just had to do it _
but I don't feel comfortable doing them. I just don't have the
experience.''
   Unlike Mrs. Edwards, Mrs. Acree carries IV equipment,
anti-hemorrhage drugs, oxygen, local anesthetics and special
suction and resuscitative devices.
   Both women studied under physicians, although Mrs. Edwards'
studies were informal.
   ``Her mother before her was a midwife, and she taught her some
of what she knew,'' said Mrs. Isbell, who said Mrs. Edwards was
recovering from double pneumonia and not able to talk to a
reporter. ``To my knowledge, she never had any formal training. She
learned from doing.''
   This didn't mean that she ignored what doctors could teach.
``She had a very good relationship with the doctors in town. ...
They taught her what they knew and she read some of the books that
they had,'' said Mrs. Isbell.
   Mrs. Acree, who has a bachelor's degree in speech and hearing
therapy, began her midwifery studies with an obstetrician.
   When she began training 10 years ago, midwives could get
licensed by passing a written test, but the law was revoked in
1980. A law passed in 1984 and revised in 1986 requires 30 hours of
courses needed to become a registered nurse and clinical training
by a physician or licensed midwife before a written test is taken.
   The clinical training includes 100 prenatal visits, helping with
25 births and delivering at least 15 babies, examining 25 newborns,
sewing up five lacerations and observing at least five high-risk
births.
   Mrs. Acree said that, like most modern midwives, she decided to
help women have their babies at home after she'd had a baby in a
hospital.
   ``That birth really left me with some questions about the way
women were treated in childbirth,'' she said. ``They didn't allow
fathers in the labor and delivery area, it was a big ward, you had
your baby by yourself, they took the baby to the nursery right away
and you never saw your baby unless you asked.''
   Hospitals have answered demand by setting up ``birthing rooms.''
   ``It's nice to say `Oh, we have this birthing room, you can have
a homelike delivery.' But if you go in and you still are forced to
labor strapped to a fetal monitor with an IV in your arm, you're
limited in your options _ for instance, in the positions that you
want to choose to labor or give birth,'' said Mrs. Acree.
   When Mrs. Edwards was delivering babies, there was little
question about where they would be born _ the houses in rural
Avoyelles, St. Landry and Rapides parishes often were so far from a
hospital that there was no choice.
   Today's midwives in Louisiana _ each state where midwives are
licensed has its own rules _ may attend only women whose doctors
have certified that their births are likely to be uncomplicated.
They must have a doctor on call.
   Mrs. Acree said she's lucky _ many Lafayette doctors support
midwives. She and her partner deliver about 50 babies a year.
Midwives in other cities have had trouble finding medical backup,
and one Yale-trained midwife has given up and enrolled in law
school, she said.
   Women who seek out midwives are likely to be professionals and
college graduates, ``motivated and willing to do the research and
investigate alternatives.''
   ``There's also the working poor _ they don't have $3,000 or
$4,000 for a hospital delivery, they don't qualify for a Medicaid
card, they don't have insurance,'' Mrs. Acree said.
   That means midwives can help reduce Louisiana's high infant
mortality rate by explaining the importance of nutrition and
prenatal care, she said.
   According to 1988 Census Bureau statistics, Louisiana has the
sixth highest infant mortaility rate in the nation at 11.8 per
thousand live births, compared with the U.S. average of 10.1 deaths.
   Mrs. Acree's experience shows attitudes may be changing even
among people who can afford hospitals.
   ``Believe it or not, in the last two years I've delivered a lot
of patients from the medical community,'' she said. ``I helped two
physicians deliver their children at home, I delivered about four
nurse-anesthetists, and several dozen RNs.''
   One doctor was the female obstetrician who is Mrs. Acree's
backup. The other, she said, was a physician whose wife insisted on
having the baby at home.
   ``He was kind of resistant. Unfortunately, physicians are
ingrained in fear. That's a basic part of their training, is to
learn complications and fear,'' said Mrs. Acree. ``That's what you
need a doctor for _ if everything was fine, you wouldn't need
help.''
   Mrs. Acree said she and Mrs. Edwards also have in common a
feeling that lasts long after delivery.
   ``She told me that you'd go down the street, and in an afternoon
you'd see a dozen kids in the neighborhood that you'd delivered.
They were like your kids. It didn't matter what color they were,
they were still your kids. Your baby. You had delivered them.''

<HEAD>Child's Worst Reaction to Death of Parent May Be Delayed, Study
Suggests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About half the children in a study experienced
their most severe reactions a month after a parent's death, but
many others were hit hardest psychologically six months after the
loss.
   A third of children in a study showed a more severe reaction at
that time than at one month or 13 months after the loss, said Dr.
Elizabeth Weller of Ohio State University.
   ``It seems these kids are kind of numb'' earlier on, she said.
``They don't know what hit them. It takes time for them to
assimilate what has happened.''
   The study focused on 38 children ages 5 to 12. Twenty-three had
expected the death.
   Using interviews, Weller and colleagues looked for two dozen
psychiatric symptoms at about one month, six months and 13 months
after the death. The 13-month interval was chosen to avoid
reactions to the anniversary of the death.
   About half the children showed their most severe reaction at one
month. Prominent symptoms among the children at that point included
sadness, irritability, impaired concentration, fatigue, low
self-esteem, suicidal thoughts, loss of pleasure and fears that
something would happen to the remaining parent.
   At six months, only sadness and irritability were noted in at
least 40 percent of the children. At 13 months, no single symptom
appeared in 40 percent of the children.
   Interviews with parents found they tended to underestimate the
severity of their children's reactions, she said. Parents are
overwhelmed with their own grief, and children may conceal symptoms
to protect the stressed parent, she said.
   Weller said researchers found no way to predict which children
would have their most severe reaction at six months.
   She described the work at the recent annual meeting of the
American Psychiatric Association.

<TEXT>
   Surgeons who thought they were removing a tumor
discovered the problem was actually a fragment of a ballpoint pen
that lay undetected for 22 years, a report says.
   The patient had sought medical help for a swelling on the side
of his face, near his right ear. He said it had appeared two years
before and steadily grown.
   After X-rays showed an abnormality in a salivary gland, doctors
assumed it was a benign tumor and scheduled surgery to remove it.
   But the operation uncovered an inch-long fragment of a ballpoint
pen, and no evidence of tumor. The patient had a normal recovery
and left the hospital two days later.
   ``After direct questioning, the patient's parents recalled a
fight with his brother when he was 4 years old, during which he was
punctured inside the mouth with a pen'' that now, 22 years later,
was finally removed, doctors reported.
   Drs. Guillermo Raspall and Javier Gonzalalez of the Hospital
Valle de Hebron in Barcelona, Spain, describe the case in the June
issue of the Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery.

   The House today raced toward a showdown on a
constitutional amendment to ban flag burning and Speaker Thomas S.
Foley said failure to capture the required two thirds vote would
doom it for the year.
   ``Whatever happens today is the final action,'' Foley declared
at a morning news conference. ``... We're not going to go around
and around and around and around.''
   Emotional appeals to patriotism and warnings against tampering
with the Constitution's guarantee of free speech rang out in the
chamber as the House debate got under way.
   A panoramic picture of the Iwo Jima Memorial showing Marines
hoisting the flag over Mount Suribachi was brought to the floor
beside a photo of a flaming flag in Central Park, where ``the goofs
and the goons held it up in open rebellion,'' said Rep. James
Quillen, R-Tenn.
   ``Are we so fragile as a nation that we cannot rise above such
cheap tactics'' as flag burning, asked Rep. David E. Skaggs,
D-Colo. ``What assurance is there that this excision in the Bill of
Rights, once breached, would not lead to others?''
   Foley appeared to rule out a suggestion by Senate Minority
Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., even if the House rejected the measure the
first time around the Senate could approve it and send it back,
possibly in modified form.
   ``We will vote today on this matter for the final time this
session,'' Foley told a morning news conference. On Wednesday, he
said some of the measure's supporters had given way to ``crass
political opportunism'' and would ``hurt their own cause by that
kind of egregious political snickering.''
   As the intensity picked up Wednesday, supporters promised to
carry on their campaign even if the amendment is defeated on the
House floor.
   ``If they think this issue goes away on Friday, they have no
comprehension of what's going on out there,'' said Republican Whip
Newt Gingrich of Georgia. ``And I expect that if we do lose, you'll
see more anger and outrage than if we win.''
   Backers and opponents of the amendment said it likely would not
muster the necessary two-thirds margin in the House.
   President Bush said Wednesday in Huntsville, Ala., that a
``carefully drawn amendment to make burning of the American flag a
crime'' is needed because the flag is a unique symbol.
   Republicans on Capitol Hill, however, grumbled that the White
House should have done more one-on-one lobbying.
   Democratic leaders have been campaigning against the amendment
on grounds that it would undermine the constitutional guarantee of
free speech.
   The amendment would allow the federal government and the states
to ban burning or otherwise desecrating the American flag.
   To become part of the Constitution, the amendment needed 289
votes in the House and 67 in the Senate plus ratification by 38
state legislatures.
   In the Senate, Democratic Whip Alan Cranston of California said
his count was 54 in favor, 29 opposed and 17 on the fence.
   Meanwhile, former federal Judge Robert Bork was testifying today
before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the proposed amendment.
   The House planned six hours of debate followed by a vote on the
amendment. After that, the lawmakers planned to vote on a simple
statute that would ban flag burning.
   The amendment was debated heavily last year after the Supreme
Court struck down a Texas law that banned flag burning. But
lawmakers ultimately passed a law to ban flag burning instead of a
constitutional amendment.
   The Supreme Court last week declared the statute
unconstitutional, rekindling debate over the constitutional
amendment.
   House debate took on an acid tone Wednesday as Rep. Gerald
Solomon, R-N.Y., told critics that in pushing for a quick vote they
were ``gagging 10 million veterans through this nation'' and
``kowtowing to ilk like the Communist Youth Brigade.''
   Democrats objected and Solomon eventually apologized. The
remarks were stricken from the record.
   The sharp words, however, underlined the intensity of emotions
in the House over the issue. Foley, asked about Gingrich's remarks,
said some sponsors ``are concerned, apparently, about the political
issue and the political opportunities they think this represents.''
   ``I don't think the American people are going to respond
favorably to that,'' Foley said. ``What I don't think they are
going to appreciate and support is crass political opportunism, a
kind of wringing their hands gleefully and saying, this is where we
are going to clean up.''
   Veterans' groups had sought to mount a grassroots lobbying
campaign for the amendment but were caught off guard by the swift
move to whisk the bill to the House floor.
   ``We fail to see why it is so necessary to rush this legislation
to a vote on Thursday,'' said Walter G. Hogan, national commander
of the Veterans of Foreign Wars.

<HEAD>Kohlberg Kravis Plans Recapitalization of Food and Tobacco Giant</HEAD>

   A Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. plan to
recapitalize RJR Nabisco Inc. bolstered its junk bonds and
indicated the food and tobacco company will be left intact and
eventually returned to public ownership.
   Under the tentative plan announced Wednesday, Kohlberg Kravis
would retire a large part of the $6 billion in junk bonds it used
to buy the food and tobacco company in a record $24.53 billion
buyout last year.
   The buyout firm plans to inject fresh equity into RJR Nabisco
and raise bank loans to retire the bonds. Kohlberg Kravis also
would issue preferred stock convertible into common stock in RJR
Nabisco.
   The plan is likely to lower returns for Kohlberg Kravis and its
investors, but it would avert the prospect of RJR Nabisco having to
pay sharply higher interest rates on its junk bond debt next year.
   The equity injection and sale of stock also could counter any
notions that Kohlberg Kravis might dismantle RJR Nabisco, as it did
after with Beatrice Co.
   Beatrice once owned such well-known businesses as the Avis car
rental company, Tropicana juice products, Hunt and Wesson foods,
Samsonite luggage, Swift meats and Playtex personal products.
   Between its $6.1 billion acquisition of Beatrice in 1985 and
this month, when the conglomerate's remaining food operations were
sold, Kohlberg Kravis divested the company piece by piece. In the
process, the buyout firm and its investors reaped a fat 50 percent
return on their original equity investment.
   RJR Nabisco also has a variety of food lines and a separate
tobacco business. But analysts say that while Beatrice was ripe for
a breakup, RJR Nabisco is not.
   Beatrice ``had this and that _ a lot of things that didn't make
sense to have together anyway,'' said Jack Maxwell, an analyst who
follows RJR Nabisco for Wheat, First Securities Inc. in Richmond,
Va.
   RJR Nabisco has product lines that conceivably could be pared,
but Maxwell said he doubted Kohlberg Kravis would begin unloading
food divisions and ``you can't sell bits and pieces of the tobacco
business very well.''
   Since its buyout, RJR has divested $5.66 billion in assets to
pare its debt, which now stands at $22 billion. Its Del Monte
canned foods and fresh fruit businesses and some foreign holdings
were among those sold.
   But, said Maxwell, ``They've sold pretty much what they want to
sell.''
   In its announcement, RJR Nabisco said Kohlberg Kravis would
invest an additional $1.7 billion in the company as part of the
recapitalization.
   Analysts see RJR Nabisco returning to public ownership in the
next few years. That is the route taken by another Kohlberg Kravis
holding, Safeway Stores Inc.
   After Safeway went private in a 1986 leveraged buyout, the
supermarket company began hammering away at its debt and
streamlined operations. This past February, the company announced a
modest initial offering of 10 million shares.
   RJR Nabisco also said it was negotiating new loans with banks.
The company said it expected to begin enacting the recapitalization
by the end of July.
   The plan is intended to take off the market some of RJR
Nabisco's junk bonds, which declined sharply in value earlier this
year. A buyback of the bonds would allow Kohlberg Kravis to
sidestep provisions requiring the firm to guarantee the price of
the bonds by next April.
   RJR Nabisco bonds rose sharply Wednesday on word of the
recapitalization, gaining as much as $6.25 per $100 in face value.
   Kohlberg Kravis' investors mostly are large pension funds that
generally do not have an active voice in the management of the
companies they own, including RJR Nabisco. Officials of several
funds declined to comment on what they'd like to see happen to RJR
Nabisco.
   But several said they were satisfied with management.
   David Weig, executive director of the Washington State
Investment Board, said he was ``absolutely happy'' with the
management at RJR Nabisco and with Kohlberg Kravis.
   Oregon state pension officials also said they were happy. ``We
have had excellent returns from these kinds of investments,'' said
Sheryl Wilson, executive director of the state's retirement funds.

<HEAD>McDonnell Douglas Plans Layoffs; General Dynamics' Bond Ratings
Dropped</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The sagging defense industry has dealt another
blow to the nation's top two defense contractors.
   McDonnell Douglas Corp. announced plans Wednesday for major
layoffs to help pare at least $700 million a year from its costs,
and General Dynamics Corp. had its credit rating cut by a major
rating agency.
   The developments at the two St. Louis-based companies came one
day after Defense Secretary Dick Cheney proposed a 25 percent cut
in the nation's military spending.
   The proposed cuts would affect McDonnell Douglas' Harpoon and
Tomahawk missiles and the F-15 and FA-18 jet fighters. General
Dynamics makes F-16 fighter jets for the Air Force, M1 tanks for
the Army and SSN-688 submarines for the Navy.
   Moody's Investors Service Inc., which downgraded General
Dynamics' credit rating, said ``the manufacturers of defense
platforms (planes, tanks, submarines) will be the most severely
affected by reduced defense spending.''
   Officials at McDonnell Douglas, the nation's biggest defense
contractor, said they didn't know yet how many of the company's
127,000 workers might lose their jobs.
   However, sources at the company and in Washington said they had
been told about 4,000 of McDonnell's 40,500 employees in St. Louis
will be cut. Nationwide, the company probably will lay off 7,000 to
8,000 people, one source said.
   ``The hard reality is we must begin immediately to take further
strong actions to reduce our costs,'' John F. McDonnell, the
company's chairman and chief executive, said in a letter to
employees.
   He added that ``to reduce costs by the desired amount will
entail substantial layoffs across the corporation.'' The company
will not offer voluntary retirement packages as part of the cuts,
he said.
   McDonnell already has announced plans to lay off 4,000 workers
and 3,000 contracted workers at its Douglas Aircraft Co. in Long
Beach and Torrance, Calif. Douglas Aircraft, its production behind
schedule on the C-17 military cargo plane and the MD-80 jetliner,
has lost $306 million in the past 15 months.
   McDonnell said the cost-cutting plan should be in place by early
August, with immediate steps being taken on overtime, travel, new
hiring, consultants, advertising and support activities.
   The layoffs are likely to be focused on the company's salaried
and administrative ranks rather than on production workers,
officials indicated.
   Industry analyst Paul Nisbet of Prudential-Bache in New York
said the layoffs are a sign of transition rather than severe
trouble at McDonnell Douglas.
   Nisbet estimated the company has a backlog of over $50 billion
in commercial aircraft orders. He predicted McDonnell's sales would
reach $16.2 billion this year and $20 billion by 1992, compared
with $14.58 billion in 1989.
   The layoffs represent ``just a shift in business from what
predominantly was a military market in the '80s to a predominantly
commercial market in the '90s,'' Nisbet said. ``They're just having
trouble digesting it.''
   In addition to programs that would be affected by the proposed
defense cuts, chairman McDonnell wrote employees that the company
faces ``potential serious cost problems'' on its A-12 advanced
tactical aircraft, the C-17 airlifter and T-45A Goshawk trainer
programs.
   Moody's cited sagging conditions in the defense industry in
dropping its credit ratings by two notches on General Dynamics, the
nation's No. 2 defense contractor.
   The action dropped the company's senior debt from A2 to Baa1 and
its subordinated debt from A3 to Baa2. The new ratings put the
bonds in the bottom category of investment grade.
   Fred Pastore, an associate director at Moody's, said the
downgrade reflected the company's decreased amount of readily
available cash as well as its vulnerability to defense cuts.
   Spokesman Pete Connolly said General Dynamics was disappointed
with the downgrade. ``We feel we have both a strong balance sheet
and a strong balance of business which will sustain us through this
period,'' he said.
   In addition to its military business, the company owns Cessna
Aircraft Co. and makes a launch rocket used to put satellites into
orbit.

<HEAD>Chase Chairman Stepping Down In October</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Chase Manhattan Corp. said it would appoint a
new chairman as part of an early management shakeup that officials
indicated would include cutbacks in the corporate finance area.
   Current president, Thomas G. Labrecque, 51, will replace Willard
C. Butcher, 63, as chairman and chief executive officer effective
Oct. 31, the nation's second-largest bank holding company said
Wednesday.
   The change is part of a wave of cutbacks by major investment and
commercial banks to cope with a downturn in the market for mergers,
acquisitions and leveraged buyouts that flourished on Wall Street
in the 1980s.
   In an interview, Labrecque said he and Butcher recommended the
change to the bank's board of directors. The succession had been
expected, but he said the timing was being accelerated to implement
changes in corporate finance.
   Chase Manhattan, which ranks behind Citicorp in terms of assets,
has 41,000 employees worldwide, 27 percent of them in corporate
finance.
   ``What we really have to restructure is our corporate finance
capabilities in terms of its size worldwide and the integration of
it worldwide,'' he said. ``The question is the size of the
infrastructure to support the level of business being done.''
   ``The assumption should not be that we're getting out of the
business,'' he said. ``It's anything but that.''
   Labrecque declined to specify changes but said the bank would
have more to say next week.
   Other banks that engage in wholesale lending to large
corporations and corporate finance also are reducing their staff
sizes.
   Bankers Trust New York Corp. said Monday it is cutting 10
percent of its corporate finance department, or 75 jobs.
Manufacturers Hanover Corp. also is expected to reduce its domestic
and foreign corporate finance operations and already has announced
a restructuring of its wholesale banking business.
   Labrecque said Chase, which recently sold subsidiaries in the
Netherlands and Belgium, planned to retain a presence in the more
than 50 countries in which it now operates.
   He also said restructuring efforts would focus on the bank's
loan problems, which contributed to a 66 percent decline in
first-quarter earnings to $44 million from $132 million in the same
1989 period.
   The bank said its earnings were hurt by a $75 million increase
in provisions for losses from bad loans, mostly because of
deterioration in some U.S commercial real estate markets.
   The company added $225 million to reserves against possible loan
losses in the first quarter, up from $150 million a year ago and
$130 million in the 1989 fourth quarter.
   The bank said it wrote off $325 million in bad loans in the
quarter, including $114 million to Third World countries, up from a
total of $159 million in the year-ago period.
   Butcher issued a statement saying the executive change was ``a
natural step in implementing an orderly management succession which
has been under way since early 1988.'' He joined Chase in 1947 and
was elected chairman in 1981.
   ``We have accelerated the process because there are a series of
business challeneges requiring organizational changes that could
not be implemented until the issue of management succession was
resolved,'' the statement read.
   In addition, Chase said vice chairman Arthur F. Ryan would
become president and chief operating officer of Chase Manhattan
Corp. and Chase Manhattan Bank.
   Labrecque joined Chase in 1964 and was elected vice chairman and
chief operating office in 1980 and president in 1984.

<HEAD>Clorox Expands its Household Products Line with Pine-Sol, Combat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Clorox Co., known for its bleach, has
fortified its household products line with the $465 million
purchase of the Pine-Sol cleaner and Combat insecticide businesses
from American Cyanamid Co.
   Under the deal signed Wednesday, Clorox is acquiring the
household products portion of Cyanamid's Shulton Group. That
includes Pine-Sol, the nation's top-selling household cleaner, and
Combat, the No. 2 insecticide brand.
   Last week, Cyanamid, based in Wayne, N.J., agreed to sell most
of Shulton's toiletries business, including Old Spice, to Procter &amp;
Gamble Co. for $370 million.
   Cyanamid said it also would sell Shulton's Breck and Lady's
Choice lines.
   ``The Shulton divestiture is another step in our continuing
strategy to focus Cyanamid's resources on its core businesses in
the medical, agricultural and specialty chemicals areas,'' said
George J. Sella Jr., chairman, president and chief executive
officer.
   Cyanamid spokeswoman Edwina G. Sanders declined to comment on
the company's plans for Pierre Cardin men's cologne, its sole
remaining consumer product.
   Shulton accounted for 3 percent of Cyanamid's operating profits
last year and 12 percent of its sales of $4.8 billion, she said.
   The agreements with Clorox and Proctor &amp; Gamble are subject to
federal antitrust approval.
   Clorox, based in Oakland, Calif., said the purchase will be
funded by up to $400 million in short-term debt, with the remainder
in cash.
   C.R. Weaver, Clorox chairman, president and chief executive,
said the acquisitions will boost the company's clout.
   He noted that Clorox had earlier acquired such brands as
Liquid-plumber and Formula 409 which were established products
before the purchases, giving the company an edge in marketing.
   ``By acquiring Combat, we avoid the sizable expense and risk
involved in the development and national expansion of a new
product,'' Weaver said.
   Combat is the No. 2 brand in the $450 million insecticide market
after Raid. A 5-year agreement also gives Clorox rights to sell new
household-insecticide products using compounds from Cyanamid.

<HEAD>UAW Vows to Stand Firm on Minimum Employment Levels at Big Three</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Auto Workers union won't drop
demands for minimum employment levels in exchange for improved
income guarantees for most workers, union President Owen Bieber
said.
   ``Much of the job shrinkage the companies are confronting us
with is not inevitable, and we should fight it and try to reverse
it,'' Bieber told the UAW's Ford Council in Indianapolis on
Wednesday.
   Contracts covering about 500,000 active and laid-off workers at
Ford Motor Co., General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp. expire
Sept. 14.
   Under a Big Three proposal, the UAW would scrap a requirement
for automakers to hire one new worker for every two who retire,
quit or die. In exchange, automakers would have expanded income
maintenance programs.
   Many automotive analysts have said the Big Three can't remain
competitive with the number of hourly workers they currently employ.
   Bieber said the union acknowledges that job reductions are
necessary but refused to discuss how or when the union would permit
them until talks open next month.
   Bieber also called on Ford to reverse its growing reliance on
overseas operations to develop cars it sells in North America.
   ``We can't embrace Ford's world car concept when it directly
threatens our future,'' Bieber said.

<HEAD>The Travelers Cutting Back on Auto and Homeowners Insurance in
Nine States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW FRASER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Travelers Corp. says it will stop
selling automobile and homeowners insurance policies in nine states
where business has been slow in order to focus on more profitable
markets.
   ``In today's competitive environment, we must preserve our
capital for only the very best business opportunities and that
requires increasingly higher standards of performance,'' said
Ronald E. Foley, senior vice president for personal lines at
Travelers.
   The Hartford-based company said Wednesday it will stop writing
automobile and homeowners policies in South Carolina, North Dakota,
South Dakota, Wyoming, West Virginia, Nevada, Idaho, Arkansas and
Oklahoma. The move takes effect immediately in some states, said
Richard Fly, a Travelers spokesman.
   Fly said the company will begin phasing out existing policies in
November. He said Travelers had no figures on how many customers
the decision would affect.
   ``Generally those states have proven to be unprofitable to us,''
Fly said. ``Our strategy for some time has been to concentrate on
those states where we see the possibility for future and long-term
growth.''
   The company also said it has reduced the number of independent
agents selling its personal insurance policies and revamped its
agent commission schedule, paying them on a performance scale
instead of a flat commission beginning Jan. 1.
   Fly said the decision will have no immediate impact on the
company's staff, although the company will evaluate whether layoffs
are needed as the withdrawals take place.
   The company said it has reduced its agent force by about 900
over the past year.
   Analysts predict that the changes will not have much effect on
consumers in the states Travelers is leaving.
   ``Other insurance companies are going to be able to handle those
policies with not much of a ripple in the market,'' said Alvin
Parsons, vice president of the American Insurance Association, a
Washington, D.C.-based insurance lobby.
   Travelers said earlier this year it was evaluating its
homeowners and automobile businesses nationwide. The company has
already withdrawn from the automobile insurance field in
California, and stopped writing new policies in Pennsylvania. It
said it would carefully choose customers in other states.
   Travelers is one of a growing number of major insurers who have
decided to cut or abandon personal lines of insurance because of
what they say are declining profits and increased meddling by state
regulators and lawmakers.
   Other insurers making drastic changes include Xerox Corp.'s Crum
and Forster insurance division, Aetna Life and Casualty Co., and
The Hartford Insurance Group, Philadelphia-based Cigna Corp., The
New Hampshire Insurance Group and Continental Corp. in New York.
   Travelers lost $13 million in 1989 on its personal lines
business, which includes automobile and homeowners policies, Fly
said. He said the nine states affected accounted for $42 million in
premiums in 1989, about four percent of the company's $1.7 billion
in personal lines premiums.
   Robert Rusbuldt, an assistant vice president with the
Independent Insurance Agents of America, a lobby for independent
agents, said the decision was not surprising.
   ``(Insurance companies) have been looking at automobile
insurance as a loss leader,'' he said. ``The loss has been getting
so bad in certain states that it's just not worth it anymore.''
   Parsons blamed deteriorating business climates for Travelers'
move.
   ``If you look at (the nine states) they are small markets and
Travelers may have decided that it was not worthwhile writing
business there,'' he said.

   After years of seeing strong growth in the
number of passengers flying around the United States, the aviation
industry is trying to figure out why air travel is actually down in
some key markets.
   Despite the slowdown, now in its third year, industry groups
still predict that strong growth will create a critical demand for
new airports and more runways by the end of the century.
   Air travel within the United States increased only 1 percent in
1989 while the number of passengers boarding international flights
from U.S. airports went up 11 percent, the Airport Operators
Council International said in a report Wednesday. Travel was up
13.8 percent in Pacific Rim countries and 7 percent in Europe.
   An accompanying report by the Partnership for Improved Air
Travel said aviation's contribution to the economy hit nearly $600
billion in 1989, a 13.8 percent increase over the last study, which
covered 1987. But most of the growth was in commercial aircraft
manufacturing, rather than in domestic airline operations.
   Jobs, payroll and other economic factors involving the
manufacture of airliners went up 22 percent over the two years, the
report said.
   Aviation's share of the gross national product has remained
steady at 5.6 percent, said the partnership, a wide-ranging group
of industry and aviation-interest groups set up to ensure that U.S.
aviation meets future demands.
   The reports by the partnership and the airport operators were
released at a joint news conference.
   George Howard, president of the airport operators group, blamed
slow overall economic growth, higher fares and the impact of the
Eastern Airlines strike for the stalled growth in domestic
passengers.
   He said inadequate capacity at larger airports also may be
suppressing the growth in traffic as they simply run out of room
for additional flights.
   ``There is evidence of a shift in the growth of traffic to
smaller airports where capacity, while still a large concern, is
still somewhat more available,'' Howard said.
   The airport group released its annual traffic report of each of
the world's major airports. It showed three of four airports in the
highest-density markets _ New York's Kennedy and LaGuardia and
Washington's National _ actually lost traffic in 1989.
   The fourth, Chicago's O'Hare, showed only a 0.6 percent increase
but remained the world's busiest airport with just over 59 million
passengers boarding flights last year, the report said.
   Dallas-Fort Worth surpassed Los Angeles and Atlanta for second
place. Atlanta's Hartsfield Airport fell to fourth from second,
primarily because of the strike against Eastern, which uses Atlanta
as a hub, Howard said.
   New York, with three major airports, continued to be the world's
most heavily traveled market, followed by Chicago and London.
   Federal Aviation Administration figures compiled by the airport
organization showed 415.6 million emplanements for domestic flights
in 1989, 414.2 million in 1988 and 415.5 in 1987.
   Aviation officials indicated they did not expect the growth to
be so flat, but they pointed out the still significant increase in
enplanements since 1983 when they totaled 290.7 million.
   ``Our traffic results for 1989 might indicate a slight weakening
in the growth rate of aviation for the year, but we foresee a 61
percent increase in passenger traffic by 2000,'' Howard said.
   He said the airport group predicts that 76 percent of all U.S.
air travelers will face delays if the capacity of the nation's
system of airports is not increased.

<HEAD>Swiss Worry European Economic Reforms Will Isolate Them</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLARE NULLIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Switzerland, for centuries an island of peace in
troubled Europe, is increasingly haunted by fears of isolation in
an emerging super-continent.
   The wealthy country has traditionally regarded itself as a
``special case,'' treasuring its much-vaunted neutrality and
stability that has helped attract capital from all over the world.
   But as the newly democratic states of Eastern Europe look toward
the 12-nation European Community for economic deals and political
cooperation, Swiss leaders do not hide their worries about being
left out.
   ``It would be like being the only one in a school class not
invited to join the soccer team,'' said Franz Blankart,
Switzerland's chief negotiator in talks on European integration.
   Pressure for full EC membership is increasing from companies
anxious to share the economic benefits promised by the removal of
trade barriers at the end of 1992.
   At the same time, however, there are loud warnings from
conservative groups that EC membership would jeopardize
Switzerland's independence and its system of direct democracy under
which the people have the final say on all key legislation.
   The government says it's not ready to join the EC. Instead it is
engrossed in complex talks aimed at a far-reaching agreement
between the powerful Community and the six-nation European Free
Trade Association.
   Switzerland, Austria, Norway, Sweden, Iceland and Finland are
members of the loosely knit EFTA. Austria already has applied for
EC membership, swallowing fears for its neutrality.
   The talks with the Community are meant to lead to the creation
of the European Economic Space, EES, providing for the free
movement of goods, people, capital and services among the 18
European countries and creating a market of 350 million people.
   Of all the EFTA members, Switzerland is the most dependent on
the EC for trade. According to government figures, 57 percent of
Swiss exports went to EC countries last year, and 74 percent of
Swiss imports came from the EC.
   But the path toward creating a super European market has been
rocky. Swiss demands for exemptions from certain provisions
demonstrate the problems that would beset an application for full
Swiss membership of the Community.
   For example, the government wants to keep the right to limit the
influx of foreigners into a land where some 15 percent of the 6.5
million population are non-Swiss. Full EC membership would rule
this out.
   Switzerland also could be forced to change its system for
holding national referendums.
   The EC also has objected to giving Switzerland and others in the
European Free Trade Association an equal say in the decision-making
process, increasing speculation that the negotiations will end in
failure.
   The Swiss government says in such an event there would be two
scenarios: a go-it-alone policy or full EC membership.
   ``The go-it-alone policy for me is an unrealistic solution,''
says Swiss Foreign Minister Rene Felber. ``The consequences would
be isolation, which would be unbearable for a land in the middle of
Europe with all our economic, cultural and social connections.''
   The powerful farming lobby doesn't share this concern. It is
opposed to EC membership, fearing a drop in agricultural prices and
an opening of markets which are currently protected.
   By contrast, a government report has said that business concerns
would, on the whole, benefit from EC membership.
   Experts say this is especially true of medium-sized companies.
The largest Swiss banks and multinationals like Nestle S.A. already
have secured footholds throughout the EC.
   Economics Minister Jean-Pascal Delamuraz says EC membership is a
long-term option but dismisses pressure for an immediate
application as ``premature.''
   A pro-EC grouping of politicians, businessmen and publishers
plans to launch a proposal on Community membership to gain the
100,000 signatures required under Swiss law for a national
referendum. A vote in favor of the proposed constitutional
amendment would force the government to open formal talks with the
EC.
   One group opposed to joining the EC, the Action for an
Independent and Neutral Switzerland, says the country will lose out
in the European integration process and its democratic traditions
will suffer.
   ``Freedom and independence until death,'' reads one of the more
extreme slogans at a recent meeting of the group.
   Political leaders do not underestimate the influence of the
group's movement and still flinch at memories of voters' rejection
in 1986 of a proposal to join the United Nations.
   Officials refuse to speculate on what will happen if a national
referendum throws out the proposed EC-EFTA accord.
   ``There is more fear of isolationism now (than 1986),'' contends
Felber. ``We have to be optimistic. We have to believe we are
European.''

<HEAD>Japan's Powerful Business Alliances Under Fire</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Trade talks scheduled for June 25-26</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For Japanese, the word ``zaibatsu'' conjures up
images of sacrifice and dedication to the lost cause of global
domination during World War II.
   The zaibatsu _ huge holding companies that funded and armed
Japan's war effort _ were dismantled more than 40 years ago. But
the even more powerful business alliances that arose in their place
are coming under fire both at home and abroad for some of their
business practices.
   Those alliances, which have helped make Japan one of the world's
biggest economic powers, have become a prime target in trade
negotiations with the United States.
   Talks in Tokyo scheduled for Monday and Tuesday are expected to
produce an agreement on curbing business practices that U.S.
officials say exclude outsiders and unfairly control markets.
   The zaibatsu, which had included Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Yasuda and
Sumitomo, launched modern industry here in the late 19th century.
Their descendants span industries ranging from real estate to
precision instruments.
   The Japanese remain uncomfortably aware of the latent power of
these corporate behemoths. In 1945, the zaibatsu controlled a
quarter of the nation's capital, half its financial sector and at
least a third of its heavy industry.
   The six largest groups still account for about one-quarter of
both the assets and sales of all non-financial firms, according to
the Fair Trade Commission, Japan's anti-monopoly watchdog.
   Major deals by two of the biggest of the groups _ Mitsubishi and
Mitsui _ recently raised speculation that the zaibatsu was being
resurrected.
   The outcry began when the Mitsubishi Group announced plans in
March for cooperation with West German aerospace and auto
conglomerate Daimler-Benz AG. The tie-up was seen as a bold move to
further fortify Japan's top trader and defense contractor.
   An announcement April 10 of a merger between Mitsubishi Mining
and Cement Co. and Mitsubishi Metal Corp., two group firms divided
after the war, raised further apprehensions.
   ``The New Nationalism of the Mitsubishi Zaibatsu,'' trumpeted
AERA, a weekly magazine of the Asahi newspaper. ``Mitsubishi's
`Zaibatsu Resurrection' _a Dangerous Gamble,'' said the Tokyo
Shimbun, one of several newspapers that criticized the move.
   The Mitsui Group also raised eyebrows with a merger between
Mitsui Bank and Taiyo Kobe Bank _ a combination that formed the
world's second-largest bank in terms of deposits.
   Mitsubishi officials vigorously denied any attempts to
re-establish their zaibatsu. ``Those claims are absolutely
untrue,'' said Mitsubishi spokesman Hiroshi Ogawa.
   Not just former zaibatsu companies are coming under fire.
   Today, there are about 150 major industrial groups in Japan,
according to Toyo Keizai, an authoritative financial publishing
house.
   The groups are loosely identified as ``keiretsu,'' or
affiliations _ corporate families bound by mutual shareholdings and
other financial ties, as well as cooperative business strategies.
   ``The zaibatsu are like dinosaurs ... there aren't any. But the
keiretsu are a tricky problem,'' said James C. Abegglan, a business
consultant and professor at Sophia University in Tokyo.
   Some keiretsu are grouped around banks. Others group
subcontractors around major manufacturers, like Sony Corp. and
Matsushita. Retailers, in turn, are linked to producers with ties
that ensure stable, trustworthy business relationships.
   Many economists believe that without keiretsu, the nation's
entire just-in-time system of production and supply, the key to its
competitiveness in world markets, would fall apart.
   ``If the Japanese are told they must abandon this sort of
approach, the very vitality of Japanese corporations will be
seriously damaged,'' said economist Iwao Nakatani of Osaka
University in western Japan.
   Japanese rewrote anti-trust rules to allow firms to have cross
holdings to protect desirable firms from hostile takeover bids.
Former zaibatsu companies tend to keep about 30 percent of their
shares in crossholdings, the Fair Trade Commission says.
   ``These long-term, lasting relationships make the Japanese
system more efficient,'' said Abegglan, the Sophia University
professor.
   But some smaller group members are beginning to chafe at the
price of corporate kinship.
   Businessmen, speaking confidentially, say big-name firms at the
top of the manufacturing pyramid squeeze their smaller
subcontractors mercilessly.
   ``Once you're part of an industrial group, you have no secrets.
Your bank is the group's bank, and your company's financial details
are available on request to senior group members,'' one president
of a small group of electronics firms told ``Business Tokyo''
magazine.
   ``The Japanese subcontractor isn't in love with his parent
company. He's just tied to it by tradition and the threat of losing
his business,'' he said.
   Foreign firms criticize large manufacturers for establishing
exclusive outlets for their own products, offering retailers
rebates and other incentives to sell items at listed prices and
penalizing stores that sell at a discount or carry other brands.
   On June 6, the Fair Trade Commission issued new guidelines that
prohibit manufacturers from pressuring discount shops that sell
goods at below manufacturer-recommended prices. The commission also
has said it will tighten controls on bid-rigging and price-fixing
and raise penalties for illegal cartels.
   Finance Ministry officials say they also are discussing wider
requirements for financial disclosure of dealings among keiretsu
members. Wider disclosure would give shareholders more control over
their investments.
   Fuller disclosure is one of the changes Texas oilman T. Boone
Pickens has been demanding in his own battle against keiretsu.
   Pickens owns the largest share in Koito Manufacturing Co., a
major auto parts maker linked to Toyota Motor Corp. He has been
demanding, so far unsuccessfully, a say in the firm's management.
   Industry and government officials say they don't intend to
dismantle the industrial groups. But they are clearly coming under
stricter scrutiny.
   The key issue, said economist Nakatani, is how to preserve the
system that works so well for Japan while opening it to outsiders.
   ``The keiretsu need to consider the feelings of outsiders,''
said Nakatani. ``They've always done things for the sake of
Japanese and excluded foreigners.
   ``Now they are multinational companies and they can't afford to
ignore the rest of the world.''

   The stock market was mixed today, continuing the
erratic pattern of Wednesday's trading.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 9.41 to 2,885.89
in the first half hour of the session.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 6 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 481 up, 398 down and
562 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 20.12 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said traders seemed uncertain about where the market
might get any inspiration to extend its spring rally.
   While interest rates and inflationary pressures have been ebbing
in recent weeks, nothing has happened to fulfill hopes that the
Federal Reserve might adopt a more stimulative credit policy.
   Indeed, Fed officials have suggested they are still inclined to
stay with a relatively restrictive approach.
   This morning the Commerce Department reported that the gross
national product grew at a 1.9 percent annual rate, after
adjustment for inflation and seasonal factors, in the first quarter
of the year.
   The figure, revised upward from a previous estimate of 1.3
percent, was seen as confirming evidence that the economy keeps
growing sluggishly.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Johnson &amp; Johnson rose | to
65\; Philip Morris gained &rsqb; to 43~; Dow Chemical was unchanged at

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped .05 to 195.79. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .25 at 360.56.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average edged up 1.74 to
2,895.30.
   Declining issues outnumbered gainers by about 8 to 7 on the
NYSE, with 667 up, 767 down and 559 unchanged.

<HEAD>Tile Maker's Company Continues An Art</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KELLEY SHANNON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The deep-set colors and intricate Mexican
designs of pressed concrete tile once could be found in homes and
buildings all over San Antonio.
   Thanks to a childhood fascination of designer Bill Demaree, the
art form that began to vanish with the advent of linoleum and
carpet is making a vibrant return as demand for the matte tiles
spreads across the continent.
   Demaree, a self-employed designer hit hard by the sluggish Texas
economy, set out five years ago to find artisans to make the
unusual tile, which features colored, geometric designs.
   Demaree had been intrigued with the tiles as a child, when he
spent hours on the floor of his family's San Antonio home studying
the old cement pieces.
   ``I decided to go to Mexico and see if there was anybody left
who knew how to make them,'' he said. ``It was about a three-year
period in doing the research.''
   In San Luis, Demaree came upon craftsmen trained by older family
members to make tiles. Demaree fondly refers to them as ``the
masters.''
   ``There are some people that somehow don't even think about it.
It is part of their being,'' said Demaree, who now runs a 23-worker
tilemaking factory in San Luis and an apprentices' school he
established. ``These people grew up and learned from their father,
their uncle, what have you.''
   Demaree said the tile making dates to 1726, when it is believed
Vatican artisans created the first pressed concrete tile.
   The tiles were used for wall decorations in Vatican chapels.
Early molds were made of wood and hammering was used instead of
hydraulic pressing, which came into use in the 1840s.
   Demaree said use of the tiles followed the production of
portland cement. At one point San Antonio boasted the
second-largest portland cement plant in the United States, and the
tiles were widely used here.
   The peak of pressed tile production in the United States lasted
from about 1900 to 1928. San Antonio's Bexar County Courthouse,
built in 1891, used the tiles on its floors. Most of it remains in
good shape.
   But the Depression, World War II and the growing popularity of
linoleum and carpeting led to a decline in U.S. tile use. The tiles
remained popular in Mexico, where solid-colored pieces often are
found in the floors of low-cost housing.
   Demaree said basically nothing about tile making has changed
since the 1840s, except that color quality gradually has improved.
   Craftsman use two types of concrete _ portland cement for the
tile base and white portland to create colors.
   Cement of precisely the right consistency must be poured into a
mold at exactly the right depth to prevent colors from running
together when the mold eventually is pulled out.
   Tile makers smooth the backs of the pieces with a straightedge
and then use hydraulics to apply air pressure of 3,000 pounds per
square inch for three or four seconds to two heavy metal plates
that sandwich the tile. The hydraulic pressure bonds the sections
of cement together for strength.
   As much as 10 percent of the tiles don't survive the 28-day
process, which includes drying the pieces overnight then submerging
them in water for days.
   The tiles range in size from 3 inches by 3 inches to 1 foot by 1
foot. Prices range from $3 to $12 per square foot. Different tile
patterns have names like Saltillo Star, Arabesque, Lattice,
Victoria and even Bahama Mama.
   About two years ago Demaree joined with San Antonio-based
Materials Marketing Corp. to sell the product, which he ships to
San Antonio for the company to farm out to distributors.
   Materials Marketing, which also sells other products from
Mexico, has been peddling the tiles for about a year through 60
distributors in the United States and Canada.
   A few other craftsmen and companies in the United States are
showing interest in selling the tiles, but Materials Marketing
claims its operation is the biggest. Sales figures are not yet
available.

<TEXT>
   The nation's economy grew at a 1.9 percent
annual rate from January through March, the second slowest
quarterly advance in more than three years, the government said
today.
   The Commerce Department said the increase in the broadest
measure of the nation's economic health _ the gross national
product _ was up from the 1.1 percent rate in the final quarter of
1989. That had been the slowest advance since a 0.8 percent gain in
the summer of 1986.
   At the same time, inflation as a price index tied to the GNP
rose 6.4 percent at an annual rate. It was an improvement from the
6.7 percent increase reported last month and the 6.5 percent
advance originally reported in April.
   The inflation rate was the highest since it raced ahead at an
annual rate of 7.7 percent in the final quarter of 1981. However,
most economists attributed the jump in the January-March period to
the adverse effects of unusual winter weather and predicted prices
would decline during the remainder of the year.
   The new GNP figure for the first quarter approached the 2.1
percent gain in the department's original estimate in April. That
estimate was lowered last month to 1.3 percent.
   Most economists had expected little change from the May figure.
   The economy advanced 3.0 percent in 1989, down from 4.4 percent
a year earlier.
   Despite the slower growth, most economists believe the economy
will continue to skirt a recession, generally defined as two
straight declines in the GNP.
   In fact, the Federal Reserve released a survey on Wednesday
indicating the economy continued to grow sluggishly through the
first part of June, although recessionary pockets were found in
some sectors.
   The first-quarter growth rate was less than the Bush
administration's 2.4 percent estimate earlier this year. To meet
that goal, the economy would have to spurt ahead 2.6 percent at an
annual rate during the remaining nine months.
   Commerce said the improvement in today's report was due mainly
to $6.8 billion more in net exports than previously thought. At the
same time, consumer spending was $5.3 billion less than estimated
last month.
   The various changes left the GNP, after adjusting for inflation,
totalling $4.193 trillion after the first three months of the year.
   In a companion report, the department said after-tax profits of
U.S. corporations were up a revised 1.1 percent in the first
quarter after rising 2.8 percent in the final three months of 1989.
It originally reported that profits had risen only 0.2 percent.
   Corporate profits had fallen during each of the first three
quarters of last year, including a 1.1 percent drop during the
comparable months of January through March.
   In its report on Wednesday, the Fed said its survey of its 12
district banks ``suggests slow growth in the economy with little
change in the underlying inflation rate.''
   The survey, completed on June 8, shows that the manufacturing
sector remains flat but is showing signs of improvement in some
areas including some strengthening in the sluggish automobile
industry.
   The construction industry, on the other hand, has ``been edging
downward in recent months in most districts and indicators of
future construction suggest further softening,'' the survey found.
   The manufacturing and construction sectors have felt the brunt
of the Fed's tight-credit policies as the central bank sought for
more than a year to stem inflation by slowing the economy without
tilting it into a recession.
   The Fed survey found ``very little growth, if not a decline, in
real consumer spending for durable and non-durable goods this
quarter from last.''
   Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's
economic activity and has been a driving force for the economy for
much of the last eight years.
   ``Recent behavior in retail sales and reports from retailers in
several districts indicate that sales have been slow in recent
months and are expected to remain so in the short term,'' the
summary said.
   Retail sales, representing about a half of overall consumer
spending, slid in the final month of the first quarter and
continued to fall for two more months. It was the first time that
has happened since the fall of 1981 during the last recession.
   The survey found indications of continued growth in capital
goods industries, another area of strength in recent months.
   ``Prospects for a good harvest this year should be improved as a
result of ample rainfall in previously drought-stricken regions of
the country,'' the survey found, ``but cool, wet weather has
delayed planting by as much as several weeks.''
   The survey results were similar to the three previous polls
conducted this year that found slow but continued economic
expansion with moderate inflation. The latest was conducted by the
Cleveland district bank for use at the July 2-3 meeting of the
central bank's Federal Open Market Committee which establishes U.S.
monetary policy.

   Grain and soybean futures were mixed in early
trading today as prices came under pressure from continued selling
after Wednesday's weak close.
   Adding to the pressure on the Chicago Board of Trade is the
expectation of improved weather conditions next week, said Jerry
Zusel, an analyst with Balfour Maclaine Corp.
   The latest six- to 10-day forecast by the National Weather
Service calls for normal temperatures and below normal
precipitation.
   Corn futures are being pressured by the near completion of
planting. And soybeans are weakened by the coming good crop
development weather.
   A lack of export business and continued progress in the winter
crop harvest may restrain wheat futures.
   In early trading, wheat was a \ cent to 1 cent higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.35{ a bushel; corn was 1 cent
lower to } cent higher with July at $2.84\ a bushel; oats were a {

   Livestock and pork futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Cattle futures were higher on expectations of higher cash prices
and ideas Wednesday's selloff was overdone.
   Pork futures were lower in anticipation of lower wholesale
prices for fresh pork bellies and sluggish pork product demand.
   Live cattle were .03 cent to .28 cent higher with August at
74.12 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .13 cent to .35 cent higher
wtih August at 85.62 cents a pound; hogs were .55 cent lower to .15
cent higher with July at 58.85 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were 1.90 cents to 2 cents lower with July at 61.40 cents a pound.
   Livestock futures settled higher and pork futures lower in
Wednesday's trading.

<HEAD>Court Rules Against ICC Rate Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today stripped the
Interstate Commerce Commission of its authority to relieve shippers
of their legal obligation to pay carriers less than their official
rates.
   The justices, by a 7-2 vote, said the ICC policy violates the
103-year-old Interstate Commerce Act.
   The act requires carriers to file rate schedules with the
commission, showing how much is charged for services. Once such a
rate schedule is filed, a carrier cannot charge more or less than
what it states.
   But the commission, which regulates interstate trucking and has
the authority to approve or disapprove tariff proposals, adopted a
policy in 1986 that carved out an exception.
   The policy stated that it was an unreasonable billing practice
for a trucking company to first charge a customer a negotiated rate
and later seek to recover the difference between that rate and the
filed rate schedule.
   Quinn Freight Lines, a subsidiary of Maislin Industries, shipped
1,081 truckloads of steel for Primary Steel, based in North Haven,
Conn.
   The rates Quinn charged Primary for the shipment were lower than
the rate schedule Maislin had filed with the commission.
   After Maislin filed for bankruptcy protection in 1983, its
auditors determined that Quinn had undercharged Primary by nearly
$188,000. Maislin sued Primary in federal court in Kansas City to
collect the money.
   U.S. District Judge John W. Oliver referred the dispute to the
ICC, seeking a determination as to whether Primary should be forced
to pay.
   The commission ruled that it would be ``an unreasonable
practice'' to require Primary to pay for the difference between the
negotiated and filed rates. On the basis of that finding, Judge
Oliver dismissed Maislin's suit and the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals upheld the dismissal.
   Today's ruling reinstated the suit.
   ``Although the commission has both the authority and expertise
generally to adopt new policies when faced with new developments in
the industry,'' Justice William J. Brennan wrote, ``it does not
have the power to adopt a policy that directly conflicts with its
governing statute.''
   Brennan said that if the commission wants to use its policy,
``it is the responsibility of Congress to modify or eliminate''
those provisions in the Interstate Commerce Act now preventing such
use.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and John Paul Stevens
dissented.
   The case is Maislin Industries vs. Primary Steel, 89-624.

early afternoon New York quotes.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was mostly stronger against other
currencies in Europe today. Gold advanced, but traded sluggishly
because of a broad lack of interest.
   The dollar continued rising against the West German mark and the
Japanese yen after moderate losses at the start of the week. But
dealers said dollar activity still was generally directionless and
action was limited to range trading.
   Political and economic uncertainties over the Soviet Union,
Eastern Europe and the unification of East and West Germany helped
to underpin the dollar, they said.
   Dealers also said the market was waiting for Friday's report on
U.S. durable goods to confirm impressions of an economic slowdown.
Worries that a slower U.S. economy will soon translate into lower
interest rates has been cited as a factor that may influence the
dollar.
   The pound continued to climb on speculation that Britain will
join Europe's exchange rate mechanism this year. In London, the
British pound rose to $1.7255 from $1.7225 late Wednesday. In early
afternoon trading in New York, the pound was quoted at $1.72475.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Wednesday's levels, were: 1.6795 West German marks, up from 1.6785;
1.4150 Swiss francs, down from 1.4155; 5.6385 French francs, down
from 5.6405; 1.8885 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8878; 1,231.00
Italian lire, unchanged; and 1.1748 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1723.
   Selected rates for the dollar at 1 p.m. in New York included:
1.6785 West German marks; 154.765 Japanese yen; 1.41385 Swiss
francs; 1,230.25 Italian lire; and 1.17525 Canadian dollars.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.62 yen to a closing 154.60 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 154.78 yen.
   Gold rose in London to a late price of $350.25 a troy ounce, up
from $349.15 late Wednesday.
   In Zurich, gold rose to a closing bid of $350.50, up from
$347.25 late Wednesday.
   Gold in Hong Kong rose $2.80 to close at $351.65.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a late price of $4.84 a troy
ounce, up from $4.82 late Wednesday.

   Hey buddy, want a free Rolls-Royce?
   All you do, see, is buy this mansion in Brentwood: brand new,
pool, spa, sauna, stupendous views, five bedrooms, seven baths,
maid's quarters, three quarters of an acre.
   Just $3.8 million, $1.1 million off the original asking price.
We'll also throw in a convertible 1990 Corniche III at no extra
charge.
   That deal, outlined this month in a Hollywood Reporter
advertisement, is an extreme example of a host of home-sales
gimmicks in expensive California areas, where reality has hit
realty after a remarkable boom in sales and prices in the late
1980s.
   ``We've never seen as many incentives as now,'' said Mike
Silverman, a veteran Beverly Hills broker who has sold houses for
celebrities like Judy Garland and Pia Zadora.
   ``All the brokers are scratching their heads. Everyone has been
spoiled by all of these good years.''
   During 1988 and much of 1989, home prices soared at a clip of
more than 20 percent per year in areas like San Francisco, Los
Angeles, Orange County, Ventura and Santa Barbara. In many cases,
all a broker had to do was list a house to sell it, usually at a
premium price.
   Now, despite booming price increases in cheaper inland areas,
the median price of a California home actually fell to $197,107 in
April 1990 from $201,034 in April 1989, according to the California
Association of Realtors.
   There's a glut of homes on the market, too.
   In the San Fernando Valley section of Los Angeles, for example,
the Realtors' group said 13,561 homes were for sale in May, a 56
percent jump from last year. The average sales price was $306,400,
but only the under-$300,000 market was still hot, the trade group
said.
   No one has suggested that residential property values will
plummet as they have in the Northeast recently or the oil states a
few years back. But observers such as Norman Katz, a thrift
consultant with Grant Thornton's MCS Associates, believe home
prices might fall 15 percent below their peak.
   Responding to the slowdown, developers have been cutting prices.
They're also paying closing costs, picking up months of house
payments, or offering ``trade-in'' programs to help sell a buyer's
old home.
   Some buyers are even getting free vacations, fully furnished
homes or upgrades. Brokers who list expensive properties for sale
are offering luxury cars and $10,000 bonuses to agents who close
deals.
   Incentives aside, many experts say now is a good time to buy a
home. California's economy remains strong and housing prices are
poised to rebound since builders are starting fewer projects,
lessening the risk of an oversupply.
   For now, though, the biggest job is getting would-be buyers
through the front door.
   Stephen Ellis, the broker who's giving away the Rolls with his
five-bedroom mansion, said lowering the price didn't seem to work.
   ``Maybe the idea of the Rolls will get somebody else up here. I
just want to get my money out,'' he said.
   Ellis said he began building that home for his family five years
ago, but hassles with the city over its construction delayed it so
long that his twin daughters are nearly college age. Now, $3.5
million later, his 7,000-square-foot dream home is too big for just
a couple, he said.
   Ellis said his Rolls-Royce gimmick has generated no serious
offers so far.
   But Silverman, the Beverly Hills broker, said he's been able to
peddle luxury homes by offering offbeat perks.
   He'll fly buyers around in helicopters, cater meals, and pay
round-trip tabs to New York and Hawaii to sell homes. He
gift-wrapped one house, and swears another sold when a hungry buyer
went to an open house because it had a free lunch.
   ``It gives a little pizzazz to the promotion,'' Silverman said.
``I read an ad that said: `For sale. Important fish tank. Included
with the fish tank is a three-bedroom house.'
   ``It's like when you get junk mail. Some people put some really
extraordinary copy on there that will make you open it.''
   Not everyone is a fan of such pizzazz.
   ``The best incentive is to price the house right,'' said Fred
Sands, the founder of California's largest one-owner real estate
brokerage. ``For a while there, you could price a house 30 percent
over market value, and in six months prices would catch up. You
can't do that now.''
   Sands said he discourages most incentives.
   ``Gimmicks are gimmicks. They're mainly to make the sellers feel
good,'' he said. ``The biggest incentive is to drop the price.''
   ``A lot of times it just makes people suspicious,'' Kay Pick, a
Silverman agent, said of incentives. ``They figure there must be
something not quite right about the deal.''
   Sands agent Thelma Orloff, who has sold luxury homes in Los
Angeles for decades, said promotional deals are nothing new, but
they've picked up recently as the market has cooled. Even
Rolls-Royce giveaways were tried before, with varying degrees of
success, she said.
   Mrs. Orloff said one popular gimmick these days is offering
already furnished houses.
   ``I have sold three big houses, around $6 million each, with
them furnished,'' she said. ``Of course you've got to like the
furniture before you'll buy the house. But a lot of people don't
want the hassle, they want instant house: Just add people.''
   Silverman sat poolside recently during an open house _ lunch
provided, of course _ at the home actors Cornel Wilde and Jean
Wallace built in the Trousdale Estates section of Beverly Hills 30
years ago.
   Realtors dropped by to examine the house, nibbling chicken and
pineapple chunks as agent Pick explained that the 4,000-square-foot
home, listed at $2.95 million, was being sold by the children
following the actors' deaths within the past year.
   They traded stories of incentives offered to get sales closed: a
Mercedes Benz here, a $10,000 bonus there, round-trip tickets to
anywhere in the world.
   Real estate agents with weak franchises or overextended
businesses can be maimed or killed in such a market, Silverman said.
   The most notorious case involved Mike Glickman, who built an
empire of 1,800 agents in the San Fernando Valley during the boom
years. He declared personal and corporate bankruptcy this month at
age 30.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Rules On Suits Against Energy Producers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Thursday generally barred
states and energy consumers from bringing federal antitrust suits
against energy producers accused of conspiring to fix prices.
   In a separate decision, the Court stripped the Interstate
Commerce Commission of its authority to relieve shippers of their
legal obligation to pay carriers less than their official rates.
   In the price fixing case, the justices said in a 5-4 ruling that
only direct purchasers of energy _ in this case utility companies _
may file such suits.
   The court ruled against Kansas and Missouri officials who
accused a natural gas pipeline and five natural gas producers of
illegal price fixing.
   The attorneys general of 32 states had urged the high court to
permit such suits.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the court, rejected
arguments that states or residential customers should be permitted
to sue because utilities lack incentive to go to court since they
can pass on any overcharges to their customers.
   ``Utilities ... have an established record of diligent antitrust
enforcement,'' Kennedy said. ``History makes us quite hesitant to
take from the utilities the responsibility for enforcing the
antitrust laws.''
   Also, he continued, ``Consumers may lack the expertise and
experience necessary for detecting improper pricing by a utility's
suppliers.''
   Kansas and Missouri officials said in their suit that energy
producers conspired to inflate the price of the gas sold to
utilities and that the alleged overcharges were passed on to
consumers.
   Supporting the appeal by Kansas and Missouri were Alaska,
Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii,
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New
Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota,
Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and
Wisconsin.
   The case is Kansas vs. Utilicorp United Inc., 88-2109.
   Separately, by a 7-2 vote, the justices said the ICC policy
requiring carriers to file rate schedules with the commission
violates the 103-year-old Interstate Commerce Act.
   Once a schedule is filed, a carrier cannot charge more or less
than what it states. But the commission, which regulates interstate
trucking and has the authority to approve or disapprove tariff
proposals, adopted a policy in 1986 that carved out an exception.
   The policy stated that it was an unreasonable billing practice
for a trucking company to first charge a customer a negotiated rate
and later seek to recover the difference between that rate and the
filed rate schedule.
   Quinn Freight Lines, a subsidiary of Maislin Industries, shipped
1,081 truckloads of steel for Primary Steel, based in North Haven,
Conn. The rates Quinn charged Primary for the shipment were lower
than the rate schedule Maislin had filed with the commission.
   After Maislin filed for bankruptcy protection in 1983, its
auditors determined that Quinn had undercharged Primary by nearly
$188,000. Maislin sued Primary in federal court in Kansas City to
collect the money.
   U.S. District Judge John W. Oliver referred the dispute to the
ICC, which ruled that it would be ``an unreasonable practice'' to
require Primary to pay the difference between the negotiated and
filed rates.
   Judge Oliver then dismissed Maislin's suit and the 8th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal. The Supreme court
ruling reinstated the suit.
   The case is Maislin Industries vs. Primary Steel, 89-624.

   The stock market retreated today amid doubts
about prospects for easier credit.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 13.12 to

   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 5 in nationwide trading

   Analysts said traders seemed uncertain about where the market

   While interest rates and inflationary pressures have been ebbing
in recent weeks, nothing has happened to fulfill hopes that the
Federal Reserve might adopt a more stimulative credit policy.
   Indeed, Fed officials have suggested they are still inclined to
stay with a relatively restrictive approach.
   This morning the Commerce Department reported that the gross
national product grew at a 1.9 percent annual rate, after
adjustment for inflation and seasonal factors, in the first quarter

   The figure, revised upward from a previous estimate of 1.3

<HEAD>Grains, Soybeans Mixed in Sluggish Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
higher in subdued trading Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Trading in corn futures was thin in reaction to the abrupt
collapse in prices late Wednesday.
   ``After (Wednesday's) action, people were relunctant to take a
position in corn,'' said Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research
Department Inc.
   Concerns over a potential drawdown in corn stockpiles helped
boost long-term corn futures.
   Nearby futures were pressured by weather forecasts, which call
for normal temperatures over the next six to 10 days and below
normal precipitation.
   Soybeans futures were slightly higher on the possibility of
additional export business due to the continuing port strike in
Brazil. Prices were also helped by a lack of farmer selling by
South American growers, Karlin said.
   Wheat prices were boosted by expectations of increased export
business and concerns about the quality of the soft red winter
wheat crop.
   There were reports the U.S. Agriculture Department is finding
reduced test weights in the winter crop, an indication of lower
quality and reduced yields due to excessive precipitation.
   At the close, wheat was 3 cents to 3} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.38\ cents a bushel; corn was \
cent to 3 cents lower with July at $2.85 a bushel; oats were a \
cent to 1 cent lower with July at $1.40\ a bushel, soybeans were 4{
cents to 6{ cents higher with July at 6.03 a bushel.

<TEXT>
   The owners of the New York business magazine
Manhattan, inc. and the men's fashion magazine M said Thursday the
publications would merge, with the first issue due in September.
   The new magazine will be called M inc. and is expected to sell
for $3, the cover price that M and Manhattan, inc. each sell
separately for now.
   ``This merger combines the lifestyle features of M with the
business orientation of Manhattan, inc.,'' said Michael Coady,
president of Fairchild Fashion and Merchandising Group, which
launched M in 1983.
   Coady said the readership ``will deliver the best upscale male
democraphics in publishing today.''
   D. Herbert Lipson, chairman of Metrocorp, Manhattan, inc.'s
publisher, said the merger makes sense from the point of view of
readers and advertisers.
   ``It brings together all interests of the successful,
well-heeled man, and it combines two groups of advertisers whose
demographic targets are similar,'' he said.
   A joint announcement said Lipson will be president of M inc. and
Jane F. Lane, currently M magazine's editor in chief, will be the
editor. The present editor of Manhattan, inc., Clay Felker, will
serve as editor at large and will work with Ms. Lane to develop the
magazine.
   The staffs of the two magazines will be joined and located at
the offices of Fairchild, which is a division of New York-based
Capital Cities-ABC Inc.
   Patricia J. Matson, a Cap Cities-ABC spokeswoman, said all
operations of the two magazines will be reviewed over the next few
months. She couldn't say whether any staff cuts are anticipated.
   The base circulation rate for the new magazine has been set at
200,000. The average circulation at launch is expected to be
245,000. Currently M has a circulation of 160,000 and Manhattan,
inc.'s is 115,000.
   Financial terms of the deal weren't disclosed. The announcement
said all ad contracts will be honored at the current rates.
   Some other Fairchild titles include Women's Wear Daily and W.
   Metrocorp, which began Manhattan, inc. in September 1984, also
publishes Boston Magazine and Philadelphia Magazine.

<TEXT>
   The first stock exchange in
post-Communist Eastern Europe opened Thursday in Budapest, 42 years
after it was closed by Communist authorities.
   Officials hope the fledgling Budapest trading floor will boost
market-oriented economic reforms and become the stock exchange
center for all of Eastern Europe.
   On its first day, the exchange reported 58.1 million forints,
more than $900,000, worth of trading in the 41 listed companies.
   Prime Minister Jozsef Antall, in a telegram from West Germany
where he is on an official visit, said the Budapest Stock Exchange
as ``an important institution of a market economy.''
   Richard C. Breeden, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, presented the exchange with a new bell modeled after
one used for years to open trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Breeden also read a letter from President Bush that said in
part: ``Free and competitive markets are an essential attribute of
a free economy. They also represent an important element of a
democratic society. The re-establishment of the Budapest Stock
Exchange is thus a milestone in the continuation of democratic
developments in Hungary, and it should encourage strong economic
growth for the future.''
   On sale to mark the opening was a special English-language
edition of Toezsde Kurir (Stock Market Courier) that was launched
earlier this year.
   A stock exchange first opened in Hungary in 1864 but was closed
in 1948 when Communists came to power after World War II.
   ``Until the '80s it was heresy to even suggest anything of the
sort,'' said Hungary's interim president, Arpad Goencz, alluding to
Communists' description of a stock market as the ultimate symbol of
capitalism.
   Even before democratic change swept Eastern Europe last year,
Hungary tended toward reform.
   The Communist authorities set up a market for state-guaranteed
bonds in 1983 and an embryonic stock market was created two years
ago. That gave Hungarian financial experts training officials hope
will make Budapest the best candidate as a center for a Eastern
European exchange.
   In March, a key government act on the stock exchange and
securities took effect, giving the market a legal framework.
   But financial experts said the stock exchange still has a long
way to go before it establishes itself on the international market.
   Finance Minister Ferenc Rabar said at the opening ceremony that
the exchange ``does not in itself solve the problem of the
liberalization of the economy.'' He said ``we have much to do yet
in that regard.''
   In a recent article in the economic weekly Heti Vilaggazdasag,
the stock exchange executive president, Ilona Hardy, said the
exchange will need to increase the number of listed companies.
   ``To operate well, there is a need for considerably more
securities, especially publicly issued shares ... a working
infrastructure, well-trained stock-market experts and ... a new
type of investment-oriented attitude,'' she said.
   ``The situation in Hungary today and the present situation of
the securities market are not optimal conditions for the
development of a stock market, but at the same time the stock
exchange can make a significant contribution to the development of
the market,'' Hardy said.
   The exchange's main aim is to achieve reprivatization of the
country's inefficient, state-owned enterprises by allowing
companies to sell shares to meet their capital needs.
   At a trial exchange that met three times a week, volume was low,
with 5 million forints to 20 million forints ($77,000 to $300,000)
worth of shares trading hands.
   Eva Farago, head of the exchange's financial department, said
one factor hindering the exchange is that the Hungarian currency
cannot be converted freely into foreign currencies.
   But she said the lack of convertibility is counterbalanced by
guarantees that foreigners can repatriate their dividends in hard
currency.
   Rabar said Hungary wants to make the forint convertible by the
end of 1991 or early 1992. That would mean a major devaluation of
the Hungarian currency, which presently is pegged at 63 forints to
the dollar.

<HEAD>Soviets To Get $3 Billion Credit To Support Economic Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leading West German banks plan to pump more
than $3 billion into the struggling Soviet economy, officials said
Thursday, as the government in Bonn seeks the Kremlin's go-ahead
for German unity.
   Otto Lambsdorff, leader of the Free Democratic Party and a
former economics minister, confirmed the deal in an interview with
Deutschlandfunk radio in Cologne.
   The credit of 5 billion West German marks, or $3.1 billion, was
negotiated by Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, two of West
Germany's largest, with the Soviet Union's Foreign Trade Bank.
   The credit aims to help the Soviet transition from a centrally
planned economy to a market economy, an effort that is similar to
reform plans in other East bloc countries.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has told the Soviet people
that a transition to a market economy is needed in order to further
plans for radical restructuring of the Soviet system.
   But the Soviets have balked at introducing real price reform and
making the ruble a convertible currency, a move that would make the
country more attractive for foreign investors.
   West Germany has indicated its willingness to broaden economic
cooperation with the Soviet Union as part of shaping future
relations with a united Germany. Bonn also would like to see Moscow
drop bitter objections to NATO membership for the joined country.
   The Soviet Union stands to lose one of its key economic partners
as East Germany unites with West Germany.
   Many of the East German firms with which the Soviet Union traded
are likely to go bankrupt once the two Germanys merge their
currencies on July 2. Others that survive will have their products
priced in the new expensive marks.
   East Germany in the past has supplied Soviet industry with high
technology, including optics and computers, industrial components
and consumer goods.
   The future of trade agreements already concluded between the
Soviet Union and East Germany is unclear, but West Germany has
indicated a willingness to take over at least part of the existing
obligations.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher told his
Soviet counterpart Eduard A. Shevardnadze in talks in Muenster
earlier this week that Bonn was prepared to further develop
relations on a full scale.
   West German Finance Minister Theo Waigel is expected to inform
the appropriations committee of West German parliament on the terms
of the credit at a session in Bonn on Friday.
   Committee approval is required for the government-guaranteed
loan, but it is expected to pass easily.
   West Germany hopes that economic assistance will make it easier
for Moscow to accept the loss of its East German ally, in addition
to membership of a united Germany in the NATO alliance.
   Like other East bloc countries attempting to undo the chaos
created by decades of central planning, the Soviet Union needs
massive injection of foreign capital.
   Soviet borrowing has increased in the last several years as the
country develops a greater need for credit. But at the same time
its ability to repay is dropping.
   ``The need for credit is a sign of a critical economic
situation. The Soviet Union must have credit because domestic
savings are not great enough to carry out the great restructuring
they have in mind,'' said Klaus-Peter Schmidt of the Institute for

   A late round of buying enabled the stock market
to post a small gain today.
   Analysts said traders seemed uncertain about where the market
might get any inspiration to extend its spring rally.
   While interest rates and inflationary pressures have been ebbing
in recent weeks, nothing has happened to fulfill hopes that the
Federal Reserve might adopt a more stimulative credit policy.
   Indeed, Fed officials have suggested they are still inclined to
stay with a relatively restrictive approach.
   This morning the Commerce Department reported that the gross
national product grew at a 1.9 percent annual rate, after
adjustment for inflation and seasonal factors, in the first quarter
of the year.
   The figure, revised upward from a previous estimate of 1.3
percent, was seen as confirming evidence that the economy keeps
growing sluggishly.

   The chairman of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. was in satisfactory condition at a Santa Fe
hospital Thursday after being injured in a horse riding accident at
his ranch near the city.
   William Seidman underwent surgery late Wednesday to repair a
separated pelvis and that his doctors reported the surgery was
successful, his office in Washington said.
   A nursing supervisor at St. Vincent Hospital would not release
any information other than Seidman's condition.
   Seidman asked hospital officials for a facsimile machine and a
telephone to conduct business while he recovers from the injuries,
FDIC communications director Alan Whitney said.
   Seidman was in New Mexico to speak to the New Mexico Bankers
Association and to participate in an FDIC management conference in
Santa Fe. His office said he was making an overnight visit to his
ranch before returning to Washington.
   Whitney said Seidman was injured early Wednesday when he was
thrown from his horse at his ranch near Wagon Mound in northeastern
New Mexico.
   He said the horse began to buck and Seidman's boot got tangled
in a stirrup when he tried to dismount. Seidman, 69, a one-time
polo player, was given the horse by his children, who operate the
ranch and a ranch supply company.
   Seidman has said he plans to retire after June 30 from his twin
jobs as head of the FDIC and chairman of the Resolution Trust
Corp., the agency created by Congress to rescue the savings and
loan industry.

   Crude oil prices staged a modest rebound
Thursday as bargain hunters snapped up contracts following this
week's sharp decline in prices.
   The contract for August delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, rose 19 cents to settle at
$16.94 a 42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The
September contract gained 5 cents but other contract months were
unchanged to slightly lower.
   Oil prices had fallen sharply earlier this week.
   Analysts said several factors helped support prices.
   Bob Baker, senior energy analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., said a handful of British and Norwegian oil platforms have
been taken out of service for routine maintenance while a number of
U.S. refineries which had been out of service have begun operating.
   ``That's adding to the demand at refineries while we have
production restraints,'' Baker said.
   Oil prices had been depressed following reports of exceptionally
high crude oil stocks. In addition, market players have been
disappointed the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has
not come down harder on members who violate production quotas by
pumping too much crude.
   But Baker said he thinks the ``bad news is behind us'' and that
the market is ready to build back its confidence.
   Prices were mixed among refined products traded on the Merc.
   The July contrac for wholesale unleaded gasoline lost 0.24 cent
to settle at 60.23 cents a gallon after gaining 0.55 cent on
Wednesday. Other contract months rose, however.
   Wholesale home heating oil for July delivery settled 0.27 cent
higher at 47.91 cents a gallon after gaining 0.21 cent on Wednesday.
   In natural gas trading, the August contract closed at $1.528 per
1,000 cubic feet, down from $1.559 on Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Revco D.S. Inc. on Wednesday announced
plans to sell 10 stores in the South and close 36 in that region,
primarily in Alabama, in line with its downsizing and restructuring
goals.
   The announcement brings to 487 the number of stores divested. On
Jan. 26, Revco announced plans to divest 712 stores in 17 states
from its total of 1,853.
   Revco is operating under provisions of Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code, which provides protection from creditors while the
business reorganizes.
   Revco in April announced the sale of 221 stores to
Indianapolis-based Reliable Drug Stores. On June 5, 220 stores were
sold to Jack Eckerd Corp., based in Clearwater, Fla.
   Under the plan announced Wednesday, six stores in Alabama, one
in Georgia and one in Mississippi would be sold to Big B Inc. of
Bessemer, Ala., while two Alabama stores will be sold to Harco Drug
Inc. of Northpoint, Ala.
   Big B also will purchase pharmacy files and inventory of 20
Revco stores in Alabama, and one each in Florida, Georgia and
Mississippi. Revco eventually will close those stores.
   Two Alabama stores not part of the Big B files and inventory
purchases are also slated for closing.
   The company did not say how many jobs would be cut in the
closings, but a company spokeswoman said a typical Revco drug store
employs 10 to 12 people.
   The agreements with Big B and Harcor are subject to approval in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court at a hearing in Akron slated for July 10.

   A brief round of buying near the close helped
the stock market post a small gain Thursday in another quiet
session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down about 15 points at
midsession, finished with a plus-6.43 reading at 2,901.73.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 10 to 9 in

those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 168.15 million shares.
   Analysts said traders seemed uncertain about where the market
might get any inspiration to extend its spring rally.
   While interest rates and inflationary pressures have been ebbing
in recent weeks, nothing has happened to fulfill hopes that the
Federal Reserve might adopt a more stimulative credit policy.
   Indeed, Fed officials have suggested they are still inclined to
stay with a relatively restrictive approach.
   The Commerce Department reported Thursday morning that the gross
national product grew at a 1.9 percent annual rate, after
adjustment for inflation and seasonal factors, in the first quarter
of the year.
   The figure, revised upward from a previous estimate of 1.3
percent, was seen as confirming evidence that the economy keeps
growing sluggishly.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, up ~ at
44&rsqb;; American Express, up &lsqb; at 30\; Boeing, up ~ at 59; American

its Jantzen sportswear and casual clothing operation and weak
orders for jeanswear.
   Todd Shipyards ranked among the best percentage gainers, up { at
6. The company reported earnings from continuing operations of
$2.93 a share for the fiscal quarter ended April 1, against a large
loss in the comparable period a year earlier.

   Here are highlights of the treaty that
prepares the economic merger of the two Germanys by July 2.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   OVERVIEW _ The two Germanys agree to create a monetary, economic
and social union as a first step to unification under the West
German Constitution. The international implications of German
unification need to be resolved in talks among the four victorious
World War II powers _ the Soviet Union, the United States, Great
Britain and France.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   MONETARY UNION _ On July 2, the West German mark becomes the
legal tender in East Germany. The West German Bundesbank, or
central bank, will have full control over monetary policy in both
countries. The economic union will be based on a free-market
economy, including private property, competition and workers'
rights.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CONVERSION RATES _ Workers will have their wages converted from
East German marks to West German marks at a 1-1 rate.
   For savings deposits, East Germans 14 and younger will be able
to convert up to $1,200 at a 1-1 rate. Those aged 15-59 will be
able to convert $2,400 at the 1-1 rate. People 60 and older can
covert up $3,600 at the favorable rate. All other savings will be
converted at two East German marks for one West mark.
   East German pensions will be brought to West German levels,
raising most of them.
   Debts will be converted at a 2-1 rate, more favorable to
troubled East German companies.

<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. on Thursday recalled all 1.6
million 1984-90 Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird cars because
of possible seat belt defects.
   The company said ultraviolet solar rays could weaken the
seat-belt buckles' red-colored release buttons. The latching
mechanism then may not hold the seat belt in place, which could
make the safety device inoperative.
   In time, GM said, seat-belt buckle assemblies on all the
affected cars will be replaced or repaired.
   Russell Shew of the Center for Auto Safety in Washington said
the larest recall was by GM in December 1971 of 6.7 million cars
for engine mount problems.
   GM said repair priority would be given to Camaros and Firebirds
whose buckles fail to latch or to release and to those whose red
button is broken. Owners of those cars should contact dealers
promptly.
   Owners who find that their cars' buckles are working properly do
not have to contact dealers immediately, but should check the
buckles periodically, the company said.
   Beginning this fall, GM will begin replacing or repairing
buckles on cars that did not need immediate attention. Repairs or
replacements will be done free of charge.

<HEAD>Protection of Japan's Rice Growers a Special Case, Farm Minister
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan will keep its ban on rice imports, despite
signs that some Japanese would welcome them, because the nation's
rice farmers need special protection, the agriculture minister said
Thursday.
   ``We have opened the agricultural market, but there is a line
beyond which we cannot pass,'' Tomio Yamamoto, minister of
agriculture, fisheries and forestry, said in a lecture at the Japan
National Press Club.
   ``Agriculture is the foundation of our nation. ... In other
countries, rice doesn't account for over half of all production the
way it does here. That is a special circumstance for Japan,''
Yamamoto said.
   His comments showed the government will continue to resist
lifting Japan's virtual ban on rice imports, despite indications of
growing public support for liberalizing the rice market.
   A recent poll showed growing public support for opening the
market. A survey of 3,000 people by Japan's largest newspaper, the
Yomiuri Shimbun, indicated 71 percent favored easing rice market
controls, up from 41 percent in 1988. Only 24 percent wanted to
keep the rice market closed, compared with 53 percent in 1988, the
survey said.
   The agriculture ministry buys most of the nation's rice crop at
preset prices. It stockpiles or resells the staple at subsidized
prices that are several times higher than world market prices.
Limited amounts of rice are imported for production of other foods
and alcoholic beverages.
   Former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, in comments at the press
club last week, said he thought Japan ought to consider how to
dismantle the food control system that has been in place since
World War II, given the apparent shift in public opinion.
   He praised as courageous a recent shift in position by the
Komeito, the second-largest opposition party, which recently
endorsed opening Japan's rice market.
   The United States strongly has urged Tokyo to ease its ban on
rice imports during the current Uruguay Round of trade talks under
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which ends in December.
   Japan has refused, citing a need for self-sufficiency in the
country's staple food.
   ``It is only thanks to the food control system that the Japanese
can be confident of always being able to buy rice at a reasonable
price. Without it, there could be food panics,'' Yamamoto said.
   Under pressure to open its markets, Japan has lifted controls on
beef and citrus products, as well as on some processed foods.
   Measured by calories, roughly half the food Japanese eat is
imported. As imports have grown, so has concern that serious supply
disruptions such as war could leave people hungry.
   Yamamoto said that even if all its trading partners lift farm
tariffs and quotas, making their markets completely free, Japan
must continue protecting the small farmers who carry on Japan's
ancient craft of rice cultivation. The nation also needs to
preserve the rural environment for future generations, he said.
   ``Our farmers are losing confidence in the future of farming in
Japan. This is a terrible thing,'' he said. ``International
competition may require that we speed up efforts to improve the
competitiveness of our farmers, but it has to be done step by
step.''
   The struggle to preserve Japan's rice culture also is challenged
by declining domestic consumption.
   In 1978, each Japanese ate an average 180 pounds of rice. In
1988, each consumed only 156 pounds. Consumption fell another 2.2
pounds last year.
   Unused rice fields can be seen throughout Japan's countryside
and only 13 percent of Japan's rice farmers make a full-time living
from the crop.

<HEAD>Cocoa Futures Down Sharply</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cocoa futures prices fell sharply Thursday on New York's Coffee,
Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange.
   On other markets, grains and soybean futures were mixed;
livestock and meat prices were mostly lower; precious metals
declined slightly; and energy futures were mostly higher.
   Judith Ganes, an analyst with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in New York,
said the cocoa sell-off resumed a downward trend in the market. She
said a recent rally was a correction of a recent $300 slide.
   Analysts said a seven-month stockpile of cocoa, rainfall in
major cocoa producing areas in Africa and a reduction of political
strife in the Ivory Coast, a major cocoa-producing nation, helped
push down prices.
   Celeste Georgakis, an analyst with Cargill Investor Services
Inc. in New York, said the market was unsettled by unconfirmed
reports of Philip Morris Cos. buying Swiss-based Jacobs Suchard AG,
a major purchaser of cocoa.
   She said it wasn't certain if the sell-off in cocoa futures were
influenced by the reports.
   Cocoa settled $46 to $62 lower with the contract for delivery in
July at $1,185 a ton.
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly higher in subdued
trading on the Chicago Board of Trade. Trading in corn futures was
thin in reaction to an abrupt collapse in prices late Wednesday.
   Near-term futures were pressured by weather forecasts, which
call for normal temperatures over the next six to 10 days and below
normal precipitation.
   Soybeans futures were slightly higher on the possibility of
additional export business due to the continuing port strike in
Brazil. Prices were also helped by a lack of farmer selling by
South American growers, Karlin said.
   Wheat prices were boosted by expectations of increased export
business and concerns about the quality of the soft red winter
wheat crop.
   Wheat was 2 cents to 3} cents higher with July at $3.38\ cents a
bushel; corn was \ cent lower to 3 cents higher with July at $2.85
a bushel; oats were } cent lower to \ cent higher with July at
$1.40} a bushel; soybeans were 4{ cents to 6{ cents higher with
July at 6.03\ a bushel.
   Energy futures were higher in trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   The market received some support from concerns that an
earthquake in Iran measuring between 7.3 and 7.7 on the Richter
scale could disrupt supplies, said Jim Ritterbusch, an analyst with
PaineWebber Inc. in Chicago.
   The market also was nervous over a possible supply squeeze in
North Sea Brent oil, while it shruggged off news of a fire at a
Siberian oil storage station threateningg 380,000 tons of oil.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 1 cent lower to 19 cents
higher with August at $16.94 a barrel; heating oil was .40 cent
lower to .27 cent higher with July at 47.91 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .24 cent lower to .25 cent higher wtih July
at 60.23 cents a gallon.
   Precious metals were unchanged to slightly lower on New York's
Commodity Exchange.
   Gold traded in a narrow range, with the market awaiting news
that will give it some direction, said Bette Raptopoulos of
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   Gold was unchanged to 20 cents higher with June at $350.70 a
troy ounce; silver was .80 cent to 1 cent lower with June at $4.824
a troy ounce.
   Livestock and meat futures were lower on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   Frozen pork belly contracts were down the 2 cent limit on
plunging fresh wholesale belly prices, with live hogs dragged down
by spillover selling from the belly pit.
   Live cattle futures were mostly unchanged, while feeders were
boosted by higher cash prices.
   Live cattle were .05 cent lower to .08 cent higher with August
at 74.05 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .20
cent higher with August at 85.42 cents a pound; hogs were .43 cent
to .75 cent lower with July at 58.72 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 2 cents lower with July at 61.40 cents a pound.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal futures regulators gave the Chicago
Board of Trade permission Wednesday to trade options in two futures
contracts linked to Japanese stocks and bonds.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission unanimously approved a
Board of Trade request to trade options on its Tokyo Stock Price
Index (TOPIX) futures contract and on its Long Term Japanese
Government Bonds futures contract.
   An option is the right to buy or sell a specified number of
shares, usually 100, in a security or futures contract within a
designated time.
   The TOPIX option contract will give the holder the right to buy
or sell one TOPIX futures contract at a specified price by a
certain expiration date.
   Option premiums _ the price an option buyer pays the seller to
guarantee the availability of the security over the life of the
agreement _ will be quoted in terms of Japanese yen for both the
TOPIX and Japanese Government Bond options.
   The Japanese Government Bond option contract may be exercised on
any trading day prior to the contract's expiration. The proposed
trading months will correspond with those of the underlying
Japanese government bond futures contract, and the last day of
trading will be the Friday before the last business day of the
month preceding the delivery month of the underlying futures
contract.

   The dollar was mixed against other major
currencies Thursday, gaining against the yen but falling against
the West German mark in light trading.
   Gold advanced domestically and overseas.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current
delivery rose 20 cents a troy ounce to $350.70. Later, Republic
National Bank in New York reported a late bid of $349.90 an ounce,
up 30 cents from Wednesday.
   Dealers said the mark advanced on news that East German
lawmakers overwhelmingly had approved a historic economic merger
with West Germany, the most difficult step toward unifying the two
nations.
   A vote by the two houses of the West German Parliament was
expected by Friday. That parliament also was expected to pass the
treaty, which outlines the monetary and economic merger of the
Germanys by July 2.
   In European trading the dollar rose to 1.6795 marks from
Wednesday's 1.6785. Later in New York, the dollar closed at 1.6760
marks, down from 1.6783 late Wednesday.
   The dollar gained against the British pound after sterling rose
overseas. In London, the pound rose to $1.7255 from $1.7225 late
Wednesday. In New York, the pound was quoted at $1.7200, down from
$1.7220 late Wednesday.
   Sterling had been advancing on speculation that Britain would
join Europe's exchange rate mechanism this year.
   The yen also lost ground against the dollar. Analysts said
investors were moving funds from the yen to the dollar to take
advantage of higher U.S. interest rates, given the relative
stability of exchange rates.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.62 yen to a closing 154.60 yen.
Later in London, it was quoted at 154.78 yen, and in New York it
closed at 154.70 yen, up from 153.95 late Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's prices, included: 1.4135 Swiss francs, up from 1.4130;
5.6265 French francs, down from 5.6410; 1,228.25 Italian lire, down
from 1,231.00; and 1.17575 Canadian dollars, up from 1.17275.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Wednesday's levels, included: 1.6795 West German marks, up from
1.6785; 1.4150 Swiss francs, down from 1.4155; 5.6385 French
francs, down from 5.6405; 1.8885 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8878;
1,231.00 Italian lire, unchanged; and 1.1748 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.1723.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid of $350.25 a troy ounce, up
from $349.15 late Wednesday. In Zurich, gold rose to a closing bid
of $350.50 an ounce, up from $347.25 late Wednesday. Gold in Hong
Kong rose $2.80 to close at $351.65.
   Silver bullion rose in London to $4.84 a troy ounce from
Wednesday's late bid of $4.82. In New York, silver for current
delivery closed at $4.824 a troy ounce on the Commodity Exchange,
down from $4.832 late Wednesday.

adjusted $3,266.6 billion from a revised $3,260.8 billion for the
previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,060.1 billion from a revised $4,053.1 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $807.6 billion from $808.2 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 3.7 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 was 1.4 percent, which is below the
Fed's target range of 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent. The Fed has not
set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,267.1 billion, a 3.3
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,060.1 billion, up 0.9 percent, while M1
rose 3.8 percent to an average of $806.2 billion.

<HEAD>NASD Plans its Own Shareholders Rights Rule in Wake of Court
Decision</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Association of Securities Dealers
Inc. says it will introduce its own rule to protect corporate
stockholders from unequal voting rights if a federal version
remains struck down by the courts.
   Last week a federal appeals court in Washington unanimously held
that the Securities and Exchange Commission exceeded its authority
in prohibiting publicly traded corporations from weakening the
voting power of those who already own stock in the company.
   The SEC, which oversees the stock and bond markets as well as
the exchanges that trade in them, has yet to say if it will appeal
the decision by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia.
   But Joseph Hardiman, president of the NASD, said if the ruling
is upheld ``we will propose a look-alike rule.''
   The NASD is a Washington-based, self-regulating organization
that oversees the so-called over-the-counter stock market. It
regulates stocks that are usually not traded on an exchange and
provides an automated stock price quotation system to monitor such
securities.
   SEC Rule 19c-4, adopted in July 1988, prohibited publicly traded
corporations from weakening the voting power of those who own
existing stock by issuing new classes of stock with superior or
``supervoting'' rights.
   The SEC is not allowed to interfere in how a company runs itself
_ a matter left to state jurisdiction. But the rule allowed it to
bar an offending company's stock from being listed on the stock
exchanges of the NASD quote system _ which the SEC does oversee.
   Nevertheless, the appeals court agreed with The Business
Roundtable, an association of top corporations, that the rule
crossed the line into corporate _ rather than exchange _ governance.
   ``I think we clearly have the authority as a market operator and
regulator to adopt those rules for our markets and so does the New
York Stock Exchange and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and the
American Stock Exchange,'' said Hardiman.
   He insisted that such a rule would not be a ``one share, one
vote rule'' because it would not bar companies new to the public
market from creating unequal shareholders rights, only preventing
them from stripping existing shares of their voting powers.

   But he added that if other exchanges don't follow the NASD's
lead and permit unequal voting rights, then the plan could be in
trouble.
   ``If the other markets don't go along and if they start to use
shareholders voting rights differentials as a competitive tool,
then all bets are off,'' he said.

   East and West German lawmakers
overwhelmingly approved a treaty to merge their economies Thursday,
removing one of the last remaining obstacles to de facto
unification.
   Lawmakers in both countries also passed resolutions declaring
that a united Germany would guarantee Poland's western border.
   The powerful West German Bundestag, the lower house of
parliament, late Thursday voted 445-60 with one abstention to pass
the economic merger treaty after a sometimes heated debate lasting
nearly 15 hours.
   Final approval of the historic pact outlining the monetary,
economic and social unification of the two Germanys was expected
Friday, when the West German parliament's upper house, the
Bundesrat, takes up the issue.
   A loud round of applause greeted the announcement of the treaty
vote in the Bundestag, which was seen as a major victory for West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who has pushed for rapid unification.
   Kohl appealed to Bundestag members to pass the treaty, saying he
was ``convinced that each one of us will one day be judged by
whether he or she faintheartedly backed away or gave full support
on this momentous occasion.''
   Earlier Thursday, the East German parliament, or Volkskammer,
approved the treaty, ending four decades of failed socialism.
   The treaty, to take effect July 2, basically unifies the two
German states. However, details of full political unification,
particularly the future military alliance of a united Germany,
remain to be worked out by the two Germanys together with the
victorious World War II allies _ the United States, the Soviet
Union, Britain and France.
   The Bundestag also voted 487-15, with three abstentions, to
approve a resolution recognizing the Oder-Neisse rivers as Poland's
uncontested western border. The East German parliament earlier in
the day passed a similar resolution declaring a united Germany
would not seek to reclaim former German territories lost to Poland
after World War II.
   The issue had become one of the most emotional as the two
Germanys move rapidly toward unification.
   Poles had feared a united Germany might try to reclaim the
former German lands _ representing about one-third of Poland's
present territory. Ultra-conservative West Germans opposed any
moves to abandon German claims to the former territories.
   The two German parliaments met simultaneously in their
respective capitals Thursday to take final action on the economic
merger treaty. The two governments signed the treaty May 18, but
approval by both parliaments was necessary.
   In East Berlin, as the Volkskammer debated the treaty, about 100
people demonstrated against the measure outside the parliament
building.
   After the 302-82 vote in favor of the treaty was announced, East
German lawmakers rose in a standing ovation. There was one
abstention.
   The PDS, the successor party of the old East German Communists,
Bundnis 90, which led last fall's revolution, and the Greens
opposed the treaty. They said they supported German unity, but not
under existing conditions.
   As debate began in Bonn Thursday morning, Kohl urged lawmakers
to pass both the treaty and the Polish border resolution.
   ``After over 40 years of painful separation, the hopes of the
people of Germany for the unity and freedom of all Germans are
about to be fulfilled,'' Kohl said.
   Kohl urged unanimous approval of the economic merger.
   ``The treaty shows the way to German unity, and whoever doesn't
follow this road sign doesn't want unity,'' he said.
   ``For the people in Germany, this will make unity come true in
vital areas of their daily existence,'' he said. ``Whoever rejects
the treaty also rejects our compatriots in the German Democratic
Republic.''
   Under the treaty, the powerful West German mark becomes the
currency of both countries on July 2, and East Germany moves from
socialism to capitalism.
   East German wages, salaries and pensions will be converted to
West German marks at a 1-1 exchange rate. The exchange rate for
savings deposits varies with age, with a maximum of $3,600 at the
1-1 rate for those over 60.
   West Germany's main opposition party, the left-leaning Social
Democrats, criticized the treaty, saying it fails to adequately
protect East Germans who face economic hardship in the transition
from socialism to a free market.
   But their chairman, Hans-Jochen Vogel, told the Bundestag a
majority would approve the treaty. Failure to do so would be too
much of a shock to East German expectations and could lead to
``uncontrollable developments,'' he said.
   The leftist Greens Party argued against passage, saying the
treaty would not bring the two Germanys closer together, but would
create newer and deeper forms of division by making East Germany a
dependent institution.
   Some experts predict up to 2 million East Germans could lose
their jobs as outmoded government-owned factories and businesses
try to compete. More than a third of the enterprises are expected
to close and there are fears of social unrest.
   The economic merger treaty comes after months of work following
the collapse late last year of East Germany's Communist government
and the opening of the Berlin Wall. East Germany elected a
non-Communist government in March.
   Kohl acknowledge recognition of Poland's current Western border
was painful for many Germans.
   Nonetheless, he said: ``Either we affirm the present boundary,
or we lose the chance of German unity.''

   The two investment companies, which are members of the exchange,
agreed to pay $30,000 and to ``implement certain corrective
measures,'' the Board of Trade said Wednesday.
   They were accused of failing to ensure compliance by their
employees with rules governing the disclosure of trade orders

   Nissan Motor Co. said it has ordered a $22 million
supercomputer from Cray Research Inc. of the United States to help
design safer, cleaner cars.
   Japan's No. 2 automaker said the Cray Y-MP8-664, to be installed
in August, provides 2.5 times the processing power of the Cray
X-MP-432 it will replace.
   Nissan said it would use the new supercomputer in research on
improving vehicle safety, resolving environmental problems and
designing more attractive cars.
   The company said that in April 1986 it became the first Japanese
automaker to introduce a Cray supercomputer for vehicle design and
development, including analysis of how well cars can withstand a
crash. Its second Cray supercomputer, bought in September 1988, has
been used in aerospace research as well as vehicle design, it said
in a statement.
   Supercomputers have been a source of trade tension between the
United States and Japan. They were one of three key product groups
that Japan agreed to open its market to in talks with the United
States earlier this year, a move that prompted the Bush
administration to remove Japan from its trade ``hit list.''
