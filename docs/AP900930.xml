   A bomb exploded at a U.S. paint
company in Manila early Monday, the eighth blast at an American
company in a week, police said.
   They said the explosion caused no casualties but broke windows
and damaged a concrete wall of the Fuller O'Brien factory in
suburban Mandaluyong.
   Col. Ernesto Diokno said rebel soldiers may have been behind the
bombing because C-4 plastic explosive, issued only to the military,
was used.
   Seven U.S. companies have been bombed since Wednesday. Monday's
bombing was the 34th in the capital since August, when the spate of
explosions began.
   Government offices and companies owned by Chinese-Filipino
business people were targeted in the last two months.
   Authorities said the bombings are meant to frighten foreign
investors and destabilize the economy, undermining the government
of President Corazon Aquino.

   Temple University's striking professors
rejected a second contract offer Sunday night as the threat of
canceling hundreds of classes for the entire semester loomed.
   Common Pleas Judge Samuel Lehrer planned to reopen a hearing
Monday into the university's request that he force the professors
back to work.
   The proposal, which union members said offered little new, was
rejected by a vote of 372 to 62.
   If pickets are still marching Tuesday, 40 percent, or 1,900 of
Temple's 4,700 classes, will be canceled for lack of a professor.
University officials say there is no alternative because there
won't be enough days to make up lost class time before the spring
semester starts.
   Patricia Bradley, a journalism professor, said 445 union members
and 107 non-dues-paying members attended Sunday night's meeting.
Only dues-paying members were allowed to vote. She said the union
leadership recommended rejection of the offer.
   The proposal offered 5 percent salary increases over four years
- instead of previous two- and three-year offers - and retained a
request that the professors contribute $260 a year toward health
insurance costs.
   ``They think we'll just get tired and give up,'' Bradley said.
``It's a union-busting strike - I think that's generally
accepted.''
   Temple's chief negotiator Bob Harrington said he was very
disappointed by the vote. He said the union broke agreements that
the entire bargaining unit would vote on the proposal, not just
dues-paying members, and that the union leadership would not
recommend how to vote.
   The strike began Sept. 4 when the teachers rejected 5 percent
increases over the next two years. The teachers, whose salary
averages about $45,500, want 7 percent pay increases and do not
want to pay more for health care.
   Temple, an independent university that receives substantial
state support, went to court after the first rejection seeking a
court order to force teachers be ordered to return to class.
   The number of faculty members on strike is unclear. University
officials and the Temple Association of University Professionals,
which represents 1,100 faculty members, refuse to offer any
estimates.
   Judge Lehrer held two days of hearings and got both sides to
agree to the vote on the new offer. Both sides would return to
court Monday if the offer was rejected, he said.
   Meanwhile, some of the school's 30,000 students have blocked
city streets daily and stood outside a courtroom chanting their
protest of anything less than a fully operational university. Some
were arrested for invading Liacouras' office.
   Time has already run out for some students missing one or more
classes they need for a degree.
   ``The whole thing stinks,'' said James Cunningham, 20, a
sophomore in radio, television and film who was one of more than
100 students who have withdrawn from school. The deadline for
withdrawal from school with a full refund is Oct. 8.
   Some 23,000 students are missing at least one class in the fall
semester and 6,000 have had no classes at all because of the
walkout.
   ``They are yanking the carpet from under my feet,'' said Doug
Miller, 27, a senior architecture student. If classes don't resume,
he will not be taking enough credits to be classified as a
full-time studnet and could lose at least part of his financial
aid.
   Temple lawyer John Langel said that if the offer is rejected,
all classes that aren't meeting by Tuesday will be canceled.
   ``This is not going to be an educational institution,'' said
striking history professor Michael Harris. ``It's going to be a
phony. Basically, this institution is folding.''

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The tiny village of Steinstuecken, just
beyond the southwestern city limits of West Berlin, is only a small
footnote to the Cold War era. But it looms large as a monument to
German-American friendship.
   That friendship was celebrated this weekend, as village
residents turned out to say thanks and farewell to the American
soldiers who were their lifeline to the West.
   After World War II, the community of 200 people became part of
West Berlin, and fell under the American sector. But when the
Berlin Wall went up, the village was cut off from the metropolis by
a narrow strip of East German territory.
   Only one road link was open. Strict controls hampered residents
on trips to Berlin. Villagers feared there would be a total
blockade.
   That didn't happen - thanks to the Americans.
   U.S. military officials posted military police in the village.
American helicopters made supply flights, providing the enclave
with a vital link to the outside world.
   With the unification of East and West Germany a few days away,
the villgers gathered Saturday to remember those difficult days.
   ``The Americans were our greatest security,'' said Gert Knecht,
a villager in his 60s. He recalled the many friendships that
developed. One American military policeman married a local girl, he
said.
   Knecht likened Steinstuecken's plight to being able to walk
around freely inside your home, but ``you couldn't go out in
freedom.''
   ``Our security came every week by helicopter,'' he said.
   Now the helicopter flights are commemorated by a monument in the
village, with a design featuring chopper blades.
   The farewell gathering, held in a sunny poplar grove, didn't
feature any brass bands or elaborate ceremonies. The people of
Steinstuecken brought home-baked cakes and pies.
   Children clustered around Maj. Gen. Raymond E. Haddock,
commandant of U.S. forces in West Berlin, as he handed out badges
that said ``Deutsch-Amerikanische Freundschaft'' - German-American
friendship.
   The regular helicopter flights ended in 1972 after East-West
relations improved, but the U.S. Army aviation unit that flew the
route kept up ties with Steinstuecken.
   A final flight was part of Saturday's ceremony. Villagers,
joined by neighbors from the East, waved goodbye to the departing
aircraft.
   ``We must protect this German-American friendship and widen it
in the future,'' said the village mayor, Juergen Klemann.
   It is a theme that has been often expressed in the final days
before the unification of East and West Germany at midnight
Tuesday.
   Commentators warn that the present peaceful course of events and
Germany's allegiance to the Western NATO alliance could change if
the United States turned to isolationism and the Germans turned to
anti-Americanism.
   The burghers of Steinstuecken believe they owe their Western
standard of living - and their freedoms - to the years of American
protection.
   But not all West Germans share their view of the U.S. military
presence.
   In the early 1980s, hundreds of thousands of West Germans
demonstrated against U.S. military policy in Europe, especially the
stationing of medium-range nuclear missiles in Germany and other
NATO-member nations.
   While the United States and West Germany enjoyed good relations
during the administration of Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, who left
office in 1982, Schmidt's Social Democratic Party showed increasing
irritation with U.S. policies. It had long advocated a less
militaristic posture of NATO.
   West Germans have become increasingly interested in cutting back
U.S. troops in their country. There have even been calls for the
shutdown of the sprawling Rhein-Main U.S. Air Force base outside
Frankfurt in central West Germany, to make room for the growing
financial metropolis.
   Some of these pressures have been removed - the medium-range
nuclear missiles and the chemical weapons are gone - and U.S. and
other Allied troops in Germany are to be reduced in response to
improved relations with the Soviet Union.
   Will future generations of Germans remember the missile disputes
and the ear-splitting low-level training flights of the U.S. Air
Force? Or will they remember the 1948-49 Berlin Airlift and the
special attention paid to Steinstuecken?
   Gen. Haddock, whose powers as a military governor of West Berlin
end at midnight Tuesday, said in his farewell speech that ``we have
an obligation to keep alive the memory'' of the airlift and the
chapter of history written in Steinstuecken.
   ``For they indicate the points at which the history of Germany
and the United States of America was a common one,'' he said.

   Elections for the nation's 435 House seats are
likely to yield only slight shifts in power, but analysts caution
that this year's voting could be among the most volatile and
unpredictable in years.
   November's balloting will follow ``one of the strangest 18
months in recent political history,'' analyst Charles Cook says of
a period that has seen upheavals in Eastern Europe, the Persian
Gulf, domestic issues and the American economy.
   Few are willing to bet on where it all will lead, but most
analysts and operatives are guessing that Democrats will pad their
258-to-176 majority by less than 10 seats.
   In normal times, that would be a face-saving outcome for
Republicans. As the party in control of the White House, the GOP
historically could expect to lose 15 or more House seats in an
off-year election.
   Several factors would seem to favor the GOP this time around.
President Bush enjoys near-record popularity ratings, his standing
increased by his handling of the Middle East crisis. And polls show
a general public disgust with Congress, which is controlled by the
Democrats.
   But on the other side of the ledger, the economy - among the
most powerful determinants of political fortune - is headed
downward. And Republicans are being forced to defend more so-called
``open'' seats, where there is no incumbent seeking re-election,
because 11 otherwise safe GOP House members are running for the
Senate or state offices.
   The effect of the volatility has been to put most races into
slow motion. Congress, which had planned to adjourn by Oct. 5 so
members could go home and campaign, now is unlikely to get out of
Washington until Oct. 20 or so.
   Issues that have taken on local importance, from abortion to
taxes and the savings and loan crisis, have had to compete for air
time and headlines with developments in Iraq and Kuwait. Political
experts say the effect will be to compress the intense part of the
election season into the final two weeks.
   For one in five House districts, that will make no difference.
Seventy-six incumbent lawmakers - 42 Democrats and 34 Republicans -
will coast to re-election without major party opposition.
   And, as has become common in House contests, few of their
colleagues have much to worry about. Political analysts single out
fewer than two dozen races where the incumbent is endangered.
   Topping that list are Reps. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., Charles
Pashayan, R-Calif., and Denny Smith, R-Ore., all of whom are linked
to the $500 billion scandal over the failure of the savings and
loan industry.
   A handful of others are in trouble because of political or
ethical problems:
   - Rep. Arlan Stangeland, R-Minn., got in hot water for charging
taxpayers for hundreds of long-distance calls to a female former
employee of a lobbying firm.
   - It was revealed that Rep. Roy Dyson, D-Md., who accepts large
contributions from the defense industry in his capacity as an Armed
Services Committee member, claimed conscientious objector status
during the Vietnam War.
   - Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., said during a debate with his
Democratic opponent that he opposes affirmative action because ``it
is worse to discriminate against majorities'' than against racial
minorities.
   And always vulnerable are freshmen, many of whom won narrowly in
1988 and have yet to establish themselves firmly in their new
seats: Ben Jones, D-Ga.; George Sangmeister, D-Ill.; Bill
Sarpalius, D-Texas; Greg Laughlin, D-Texas; Peter Hoagland, D-Neb.;
Jolene Unsoeld, D-Wash.; Craig James, R-Fla.; Ron Machtley, R-R.I.;
and Peter Smith, R-Vt.
   Most of the action, and the attention of Democratic and
Republican party operatives, focuses on the 2 open seats where
there is no incumbent. Eleven are seats previously held by
Democrats, and 18 were formerly GOP seats.
   One hotspot is Maine's First District, where Democrat Joseph
Brennan is running to get back his old job as governor. Fighting
for Brennan's House seat are Democratic state Sen. Tom Andrews and
Republican David Emery, who is making a comeback bid.
   Also tough for Democrats to defend is the Cincinnati district of
Thomas Luken, who is retiring. Luken's son, Mayor Charles Luken, is
vying against Ken Blackwell, a former Cincinnati mayor and official
of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Blackwell is
the GOP's best hope of electing a black Republican to a House seat
in five decades.
   A slugfest has developed in the Texas, where Democratic Rep.
Marvin Leath is retiring. State Sen. Chet Edwards, a Democrat, is
running to replace him against Republican Hugh Shine, a state House
member. Shine has been attacking Edwards for appearing at a
fund-raiser for a gay and lesbian group in Houston last year.
   Democrats see their best hopes at picking open seats in
Arkansas, where Democrat-turned-Republican Tommy Robinson left his
seat to run for governor; and in Rhode Island, Hawaii, Iowa and
Idaho, where Republican House members are running for Senate seats.

   When Harvey Gantt exhorts people to get
religion and ``show some signs,'' he doesn't mean they should start
speaking in tongues. He's talking about a U.S. Senate race that
only ``people power'' can win.
   People power brought down communism in Eastern Europe, and
Gantt's task seems hardly less formidable. He's trying to dislodge
Republican Jesse Helms, North Carolina's controversial and
well-financed three-term senator.
   Be missionaries for me, Gantt tells black county employees,
white mountainfolk and wine-and-cheese liberals across the state.
Be truth squads for me. Get out the vote for me, he says, and ``we
can demonstrate that people power is stronger than all the money in
the world.''
   Helms, an outspoken conservative with a national fund-raising
network, has been pulling in campaign contributions at a
record-breaking pace. And while his views and style alienate many
voters, he has a devoted following and a hard-hitting campaign
style that has crushed all of his previous opponents, including a
sitting governor.
   But challenges are a way of life for Gantt, a soft-spoken
architect. He was the first black student at Clemson University,
the first black mayor of Charlotte, the national Democratic Party's
first black Senate nominee in this century. A victory in November
would make him the first black southern senator since
Reconstruction.
   Polls show a dead-even race with few voters undecided. But Gantt
radiated calm and confidence on a recent campaign journey that took
him from depressed rural pockets in North Carolina's northeast
corner to wealthy coastal villages on the Outer Banks.
   ``We really are going to bring Jesse Helms home,'' he told a
racially balanced crowd at a ``pig-picking'' barbecue on the
sweeping lawn of a riverfront home.
   Neither Helms' multimillion-dollar campaign warchest nor his
aura of invincibility fazes Gantt. ``I've never seen him as being a
great power. I've always seen him as a beneficiary of good luck,''
he says.
   Gantt, 47, carries a traditional Democratic message of populism
and government compassion, enlivened with tales of his humble
origins and gentle digs at Helms.
   Though some fans wear Gantt-for-Senate buttons that say ``Making
History,'' Gantt does not present himself as a pioneering
standard-bearer for blacks. He'd rather be viewed as the unifying,
forward-looking alternative to a man he says has few allies and
pushes divisive priorities that are irrelevant to most North
Carolinians.
   ``It's all right to get somebody who'll stand up for what he or
she believes in,'' Gantt tells supporters, repeating the rationale
many voters give for choosing Helms. ``But you also ought to get
somebody who'll stand up for you.''
   Helms' prickly personality is at least part of the reason North
Carolina gets a poor return on the tax dollars it sends to
Washington, Gantt told a group of courthouse employees.
   ``I've got to think it has to do with the fact that he's kind of
ornery. He doesn't get along with anybody,'' Gantt said mildly as
the air filled with knowing chuckles.
   Gantt also accuses Helms of ``thumbing his nose'' at the state's
voters by refusing to debate, publicize his schedule or answer
questions.
   If the two candidates stood side by side and talked about their
visions, Gantt told an affluent Nags Head gathering, ``I could win
every time. I'm convinced of that.'' He added, to laughter, ``I
think he's kind of convinced of that, too.''
   Gantt makes no bones about his vision - a government that helps
ensure jobs, health care, education and a clean environment for its
citizens.
   ``If liberal means caring about people, then I'm a liberal,'' he
told those gathered on the banks of the Pasquotank River for the
pig-picking. ``I just want us to return to our party and its
heritage and its great leaders.''
   It was an apt message for that area, which went for Helms in
1984 despite an overwhelming Democratic edge in voter registration.
   Gantt's unabashed liberalism ultimately may not prove any more
popular among moderates than Helms' extreme, often combative
conservativism.
   But he has been attracting overflow crowds and devoted converts,
from the mountains to the shore. Gwen Cruickshanks, the Currituck
County Democratic chairwoman, said out-of-staters at a national
businesswomen's conference in Charlotte bombarded her with
unsolicited checks after Gantt spoke. ``That's the galvanizing
effect this man has,'' she said.
   Gantt also is galvanizing blacks. ``G-A-N-T-T, it really sounds
good to me, Harvey, Harvey,'' hundreds of black students chanted at
a rally at Elizabeth City State College.
   Gantt, who designed three buildings at the college, was mobbed,
embraced, begged for autographs. ``I'm going to be there for you,''
promised the would-be senator. ``My door is going to be open for
you.''
   But blacks account for only 20 percent of North Carolina's
voting-age population. And while he won two mayoral terms in
75-percent-white Charlotte, Gantt's race could handicap him in a
contest where every last vote will count.
   ``I meet lots of people who say `I've never voted for a black
man and I'm not going to now,''' said Gail Singh, a white Gantt
supporter who runs a video business on the Outer Banks. ``You can't
say there's no race factor in northeastern North Carolina.''
   Gantt does not concede a ``race factor,'' just as he will not
concede that Helms' financial advantage translates into a
competitive edge. Helms had raised $6 million as of June 30,
compared to Gantt's $853,000.
   The Democrat said his campaign is ``on track'' toward a goal of
raising $5 million to $7 million. He called that ``more than
sufficient to maintain a reasonable amount of television. We don't
run as many commercials as Jesse Helms. We just buy smarter.''
   Helms is making few appearances and relying almost entirely on
TV ads, including scathing attacks on Gantt's support for abortion
rights and reductions in defense spending. Gantt says he watches
them and is amused.
   ``I end up laughing,'' he said. ``Then I realize I've got to be
serious - some people believe this.'' Gantt is running spots that
attack Helms' education record, his anti-abortion position and what
he considers the senator's misplaced priorities, such as his
crusade against federal funding for obscene art.
   But Gantt also has warm and fuzzy ads in which he talks about
his background and beliefs, supplementing his personal efforts to
introduce himself to voters around the state.
   He tells his life story often, and nowhere was the tale more
poignant than at the Perquimans County Courthouse, built in the
slave days of 1825.
   Gantt, a descendant of slaves, stood at the front of a small,
colonial-style courtroom that looks like a setting for the
Continental Congress. ``I come from a working-class family. My
father had an eighth-grade education,'' he began.
   He traced his father's life: two and three jobs at a time, the
government loan that allowed him to move the family from public
housing to their own home, the government restoring his dignity
with civil rights laws, the government helping him put five
children through college.
   Of his own fortunes, and the threshold on which he now stands,
Gantt said nothing then. But later, at a Nags Head fern bar crowded
with the well-heeled, he wore an exuberant grin as he declared:
``Only in America.''

   Michael Owen Perry's medicine could restore his
sanity, but it has one enormous side effect: It could speed his
death.
   Perry is a prisoner on Death Row, and his fate will be argued
Tuesday before the U.S. Supreme Court. The state of Louisiana wants
to force him to take psychiatric medication; if he is legally sane,
he can be executed.
   Perry's lawyers argue that forcible medicating would be a cruel
and unusual punishment that ignores Perry's rights to avoid
unwanted medication.
   The American Medical Association and the American Psychiatric
Association say treating Perry to aid in his execution would turn
the healing art on its head. Perry's sentence should be commuted to
life in prison, they suggest.
   ``We're saying the cost here, which is really a fundamental
realignment of the role of medicine, is a very high cost, and the
state's interest in the difference between capital punishment and
life imprisonment without parole doesn't justify that cost,'' said
attorney Joel Klein.
   The state says giving him the drug is simply a necessary step
for carrying out a death sentence, a justifiable limitation on a
condemned man's liberties much like strapping him into the electric
chair. Besides, the state is required to provide medical care, and
the medicine is good for him, Louisiana says.
   Perry, 35, suffers from schizoaffective disorder, causing him
delusions, hallucinations and disordered thinking.
   He was sentenced in 1985 for shooting his parents and three
other family members to death. Louisiana's supreme court affirmed
the conviction and the sentence but suggested a review of Perry's
mental competence to be executed.
   There is a tradition in Anglo-American law that people should
not be executed while insane. This doctrine, which dates back to
medieval times, was adopted by the U.S. Supreme Court in a 1986
decision.
   ``Insanity'' is a legal term, not a medical one. In this case it
refers to mental illness so severe that the prisoner is not aware
of the impending punishment and why he is to suffer it.
   The Louisiana court ruled Perry was sane, but only while on
medication. It also ordered that Perry be medicated even over his
objection.
   After the state supreme court refused to hear a challenge to
that decision, Perry's lawyers appealed to the federal high court.
   Lawyers for both sides declined to be interviewed on the record,
but their Supreme Court briefs lay out their arguments in detail.
   Lawyers for Louisiana say the death sentence wiped out any legal
power Perry would have to refuse the medication.
   Forced medication would not be a ``cruel and unusual''
punishment because Perry would benefit medically from it, the state
says. ``Common sense dictates that the State does not violate the
Eighth Amendment by doing something good for a prisoner.''
   In fact, Louisiana is required to medicate Perry because the
Supreme Court has declared that deliberately ignoring a prisoner's
serious medical need itself constitues cruel and unusual
punishment, the brief says.
   Perry's attorneys say the forced medication would be
unconstitutional punishment rather than treatment. The court order
gives no consideration to Perry's medical needs nor physician
judgment, they say.
   The order also ignores the ``very real'' prospect of serious
side effects, raising the prospect of taking a ``drooling,
incontinent and tremulus'' man to the execution chamber, they
wrote.
   In any case, Perry's lawyers say, Perry's response to medication
is sporadic and unpredictable, making it impossible to say whether
he would be competent on the day of his execution.
   ``With this instability and unpredictability, how is Michael's
execution to be carried out?'' the lawyers asked. ``Can the state
wait until a `good day' and execute Michael? Can Michael be
executed if his `good days' outnumber his `bad days' by some
amount? What amount? And what happens if the date set in the death
warrant is a `bad day?' ''
   The AMA and psychiatric association, meanwhile, say the death
sentence does not outweigh Perry's interest in avoiding unwanted
medication, an interest especially great ``when the injection sets
the prisoner directly on the road to execution.''
   Involuntary medication was not part of Perry's sentence, nor is
it generally authorized by confinement, the associations argue.
   Prior court decision support the idea that involuntary medical
treatment is not permitted if it runs against a person's medical
interests and is not necessary to treat a condition that may harm
other people, they say.
   As for the argument that the medication would help Perry, any
benefit ``would be both fleeting and purchased at the cost of his
life,'' the associations said in a brief.
   Outside observers are split on their reaction to the case.
   Dr. Gary Glass, an associate psychiatry professor at Temple
University and lecturer in law at Villanova University, said he
personally hopes that the court would not allow execution of a
person who is incompetent when not treated.
   But his ``utilitarian, practical'' answer is that nobody should
be allowed to make a competent decision to avoid execution by
becoming legally incompetent, he said.
   If a death sentence is imposed, ``people ought not to be able to
use their mental health and illness to manipulate that decision,''
he said.
   Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at
the University of Minnesota, calls it ``fundamentally wrong for any
health care professional to give anybody psychiatric medication
against their will for a non-therapeutic purpose.''
   If authorities are intent on executing a man while he is sane in
such cases, they should specify medication as part of the sentence
and not pretend it is medical treatment, he said.

<TEXT>
   This capital now boils with political
activity as Algeria undertakes an Arab-style transition toward
democracy.
   One question dominates: will free elections in this North
African country replace a Marxist-style dictatorship with an
Islamic one?
   The potent brew of politics and religion bubbles to life each
evening in the Casbah, where bearded young men sip mint tea and
dissect democracy and the Koran in a capital long derided as
``Moscow on the Med.''
   ``Vive FIS'' (``Long Live The Islamic Salvation Front'') reads
the graffiti on the Ketchaoua mosque, a bastion of Algeria's most
potent political movement.
   ``This is a Moslem country,'' said Ali Hamidouche, 32. ``It's
only natural that people would want a Moslem government.''
   The 28 political parties and lively free press born since
constitutional reforms in 1989 contrast sharply with an Arab world
ruled by monarchs, dictators and one-party states.
   But vows by Islaic councils elected last June to impose Koranic
law fuel fears that the democratic experiment may be short.
   ``If the FIS wins, we're dead,'' a leading women's rights
activist said.
   The Islamic Salvation Front took control of more than half the
country's municipal and regional councils June 12 in Algeria's
first free elections since independence from France in 1962.
   The verdict repudiated the ruling National Liberation Front
(FLN) and its 28-year monopoly on power.
   But local councils hold little power. The fundamentalists cannot
effect changes while the FLN holds all seats in the National
Assembly.
   Their complaints forced President Chadli Bendjedid to move
legislative elections ahead a year to next spring.
   ``No matter who wins, the first success of these elections will
be stability and legitimacy for the National Assembly,'' FIS leader
Abassi Madani said in a recent newspaper interview.
   The 59-year-old philosophy professor presents the moderate face
of a movement encompassing classical scholars and pro-Iranian
radicals.
   His alter ego is Ali Belhadj, 31, whose fiery speeches attract
thousands. He blames ``infidels'' - France chief among them - for
Algeria's woes.
   For the young men outside the Ketchaoua mosque, the FIS heralds
an end to the Soviet-inspired system the National Liberation Front
imposed on Algeria, one of the continent's largest countries and
situated on the Mediterranean.
   The fundamentalists' message is clear: the old regime was
corrupt. It brought poverty and unemployment. An Islamic regime
will stop corruption and, thereby, social problems.
   The FIS vows to end to secular practices that let men and women
mingle at school and work.
   ``For us, secularism means liberty from God,'' Hamidouche said
with a grimace.
   Ranged against the fundamentalists are dozens of political
groupings, but only a handful with significant support.
   The FLN remains the best organized. Thousands of its adherents
run the public sector to which most Algerians owe their livelihood.
   But the FLN managed only to win a quarter of the June vote.
   ``They'll be lucky to keep 25 percent next time,'' a Western
diplomat said. ``People are fed up, and they've thrown up no young,
charismatic leader.''
   The oppostion includes the liberal Rally for Culture and
Democracy, the centrist Front for Socialist Forces and the populist
Movement for Democracy in Algeria.
   The Rally received a boost when the other two parties boycotted
the June voting, claiming the FLN would rig the results. Their
leaders are heroes of the war for independence - Berber chief
Hocine Ait Ahmed and Algeria's first president, Ahmed Ben Bella.
   Ben Bella, 73, is the man Algerians are watching. He hopes to
weld a ``democratic consensus'' to lead the country out of its
economic ills.
   Ben Bella's stature is unrivaled by any living Algerian. He
planned the 1954 uprising against France and ruled three years
after independence until toppled in a military coup.
   On Thursday, Sept. 27, he returned to Algiers from exile in
Geneva, telling his countrymen, ``I don't come back to settle
scores. I come back to help my country build itself.'' Half of Ben
Bella's life has been spent in exile or prison.
   ``They never broke him,'' said Hocine Guermouche, spokesman for
the Movement for Democracy in Algeria.
   ``You've seen Mandela. He spent 27 years in prison and never
lost his spirit. Ben Bella has done more ... he won the war.''
   But he also gave Algeria ills it is only now shaking off: secret
police, a single-party system, a Marxist economy.
   Whoever wins next year's elections will struggle to revive the
sagging economy.
   In October 1988, thousand  of Algerians rioted over living
standards that plummeted along with prices for the country's chief
export, oil.
   Scores of people, including many fundamentalists, died when the
army crushed the uprising. The deaths robbed the FLN of popular
legitimacy.
   Bendjedid, whose term expires in 1993, distanced the government
from the FLN and drafted last year's constitutional reforms. He
appointed technocrats to impose market economics.
   No party seems likely to meddle with the privatization program.
But the pace of economic change remains slow.
   Unemployment officially stands at 25 percent. Families of 12
often live in two-room apartments. The government estimates 800,000
new dwellings are needed.
   Long lines form at shops often empty of basic foodstuffs.
Jobless young men survive by hawking black-market cigarettes.
Strikes proliferate.
   As the meuzzin at Ketchaoua mosque called the faithful to
prayer, one young man said lots of political parties are fine, as
long as they adhere to Islam.
   ``If the people vote for the FIS, fine. If they vote for ...
some other party and they win, that's good, too,'' said Boumari
Nacer Edde, a Casbah candy seller.
   ``The important thing is that there's democracy. We want
democracy.''

<DATELINE>TIPASA, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The burst of repression expected to
follow this summer's election victory by Islamic fundamentalists
hasn't materialized.
   Take the case of Tipasa. This Mediterranean resort welcomes tens
of thousands of European and Algerian tourists a year to pristine
beaches and extensive Roman ruins.
   Not long after the 15,000 residents elected a council dominated
by the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), posters went up announcing a
ban against shorts.
   The news quickly reaching Europe was portrayed as evidence the
fundamentalists knew no limits in imposing strict morality. How
could shorts be banned in a beach town?
   The impression of fire-breathing fundamentalists imposing a
draconian crackdown killed the season.
   ``June and July were just dead - there were almost no
Europeans,'' Ahmed Mansour remarked on the empty terrace of his
restaurant.
   But town administrator Mohammed Essamelli says the reality of
the ban was more complicated.
   ``First, this law's been here since 1965,'' said Essamelli.
``All the new council did was say they intended to enforce it.''
   Second, the law does not affect Tipasa's beaches, where men and
women in Western swimwear outnumber those in long robes 20 to one.
   It covers only the town center and was modeled on similar rules
on the French Riviera 25 years ago, Essamelli said.
   The law permits shorts in town if they reach the top of the knee
for men or the bottom of the knee for women. Essamelli finds this
reasonable.
   Mansour notes that no police officer has bothered to enforce the
ordinance and says the fundamentalists don't want to bite the
economic hand that feeds the electorate.
   ``Nobody has come here asking us to stop selling alcohol,'' he
said. ``They may be for Islam, but they know this country needs
other things, too.''
   The Tipasa case finds echoes elsewhere. Stories proliferate of
official crackdowns on ice cream and alcohol. Most turn out to be
exaggerated.
   Many of the reports originate with the official APS news agency,
an organ of the ruling National Liberation Front. The
fundamentalists thrashed the party in the elections.
   The fundamentalists certainly hope to change Algerian society.
Councils have moved to segregate boys and girls at school. The
movement debates whether women should work.
   But in the absence of holding national power - legislative
elections are planned next spring - the changes are mostly limited
to cosmetics.
   In Oran, Algeria's second city, humor made a difference.
   Fundamentalist councilors there denounced a festival of the
popular rai music, which celebrates youthful revolt. They said one
devoted to Islamic music would be better.
   A rai singer responded with a number featuring a compromise
refrain: ``I voted for the FIS, I voted for the FIS.''

<HEAD>State Colleges Feeling The Pinch of Tightening Finances</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   With state governments increasingly strapped for revenue, many
public universities are facing their worst money crunch in years
this fall.
   Campuses in at least 15 states - mostly on the East Coast and
Midwest where state budgets are tightest - are operating on
bare-bones budgets that have led to program cuts, fewer and more
crowded classes, and faculty cutbacks.
   The average tuition increase at state colleges was 7 percent
this fall, according to a College Board survey. But in a few
states, tuition already is heading up in double digits. And experts
fear new, more widespread increases as early as midterm if local
economies worsen.
   ``We're in a situation that's deteriorating very rapidly,'' said
Richard Novak, director of state education policy and finance of
the American Association of State Colleges and Universities.
   ``What's happening in Northeastern and Midwestern states is
spreading very rapidly down the coast. They are facing sharp cuts
that will have untold impact on those institutions.''
   An Associated Press survey found:
   - Student fees are up 10 percent and numerous cuts are affecting
California State University's 20 campuses after state higher
education appropriations rose just 2.6 percent to $1.69 billion.
   At San Francisco State, 250 fall classes were canceled. The San
Diego campus cut library hours and the number of people who shelve
books. Thirty faculty positions will go unfilled at the San Luis
Obispo campus.
   - The president of the University of Massachusetts has warned he
may have to fire teachers and cancel a week of classes following
state higher education cuts of $27 million during the last two
years, including a $4.2 million cut announced by Gov. Michael S.
Dukakis the day classes opened.
   - Tuition at New Jersey's nine state colleges is up between 9.6
percent and 19.4 percent.
   - Rhode Island's three major state schools have raised their
rates about 9 percent after receiving $2.2 million less than they
did last year because of state budget problems.
   - The Florida Board of Regents has told the state's nine
universities to come up with $49 million in cuts to help make up a
$521 million state shortfall. Among the possibilities: eliminating
the first summer school term in 1991.
   - The City University of New York, faced with $42 million in
budget cuts, is tightening enrollment procedures, canceling 2,000
classes, dropping 670 adjunct teachers and cutting library hours.
   - After three years of sharp funding increases, Maryland Gov.
William Donald Schaefer has asked that higher education funds be
cut $41 million during the current fiscal year because of a $150
million shortfall in state revenue.
   - Students staged a ``Save UNC'' rally this fall at the
University of North Carolina to protest cuts that have led to fewer
classes and students sitting on the floor in others.
   In several states, including Ohio, Massachusetts and Oklahoma,
declining enrollment is further clouding the financial outlook at
state campuses.
   The picture isn't gloomy everywhere. Public campuses in Iowa,
Louisiana, Utah, Idaho, Texas, New Mexico and Arizona are among
those enjoying increased state appropriations and relatively modest
tuition increases.
   Appropriations at the University of Iowa are up 9.6 percent;
tuition is up just 3 percent.
   With state funding in Louisiana up more than 11 percent, tuition
at Southern University didn't increase at all this fall.
   State appropriations to higher education increased an average of
7 percent during the last two years, according to a study by the
National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges.
Novak projects gains will be only half that in 1990-91, ``well
below inflation and well below need.''
   He and other also foresee a spread of sharp tuition increases.
   In Nebraska, campus officials are quaking over a proposed
amendment limiting state spending. The amendment on the Nov. 6
ballot would hold annual budget increases to 2 percent.
   ``We don't have a crisis right now, but the big issue is the 2
percent thing,'' said Rich Bringelson, executive officer of the
Nebraska State College System.
   In North Carolina, a $336 million budget shortfall has meant
appropriations to state campuses were cut by 5 percent - the third
straight year the schools have received less than they requested.
It's reached the point where students prefer a tuition increase to
further program cuts.
   ``All of this is revolutionary talk, but I think there is
sentiment for supporting a tuition increase if it is reverted back
to the universities,'' said William Hildebolt, student body
president at UNC-Chapel Hill.

   Good grief: The Peanuts gang is turning 40.
   The images are embedded in American popular culture: Charlie
Brown trying to kick a football, Snoopy gunning for the Red Baron
and Lucy dispensing psychiatric advice, a nickel's worth at a time.
   Now it's time to celebrate.
   In honor of the 40th anniversary of the comic strip ``Peanuts,''
there's a jazz concert at Carnegie Hall, a birthday party at the
Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County and a special exhibit
at the Smithsonian Institution.
   On Oct. 2, 1950, ``Peanuts'' made its debut in seven newspapers,
and good ol' Charlie Brown and his beguiling beagle were on their
way to becoming an international phenomenon.
   Today the strip runs in 2,300 newspapers and reaches more than
200 million readers a day in 68 countries. The Peanuts gang speaks
Chinese, even Serbo-Croatian.
   There's been a hit musical, ``You're a Good Man, Charlie
Brown,'' a series of TV specials and a book on the philosophical
and religious implications of the strip, ``The Gospel According to
Peanuts.''
   In September, cartoonist Charles M. Schulz was one of Forbes
magazine's top 10 richest entertainers, with earnings for 1989 and
1990 estimated at $54 million.
   Unlike many cartoonists, the 67-year-old Schulz still draws
every comic strip himself.
   ``Why do musicians compose symphonies and poets write poems?''
he asked. ``They do it because life wouldn't have any meaning for
them if they didn't.
   ``That's why I draw cartoons. It's my life.''
   The cartoonist was born in St. Paul, Minn. He studied art in
high school, after he saw a ``Do you like to draw?'' ad.
   Schulz later did lettering for a church comic book, taught art
and sold cartoons to the Saturday Evening Post. His cartoon feature
``Li'l Folks,'' the forerunner of Peanuts, was developed for the
St. Paul Pioneer Press in 1947. The strip was sold to a syndicate
in 1950, and the name changed to ``Peanuts.''
   Charlie, the round-headed boy in the sawtooth shirt, was named
after a friend at art school and is the cartoonist's alter ego.
Snoopy was inspired by a dog he had as a child.
   The little red-haired girl - Charlie's unrequited love who is
never shown in the strip - was based on a girlfriend who rejected
Schulz's proposal of marriage.
   Through the years, for the millions of readers, Charlie and his
gang have been like family. Followers know that Snoopy - in his
World War I flying ace incarnation - flies a Sopwith Camel. They
know Linus needs his security blanket and awaits the Great Pumpkin
every Halloween. They know Schroeder plays Beethoven on his tiny
piano.
   The 40th birthday festivities kicked off at the Super Bowl in
New Orleans in January with a halftime show featuring the Peanuts
characters.
   On Monday, the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County will
salute Charlie, Snoopy, Linus, Schroeder, Peppermint Patty, Sally,
Lucy - and Schulz - with an exhibit that premiered at the Louvre in
January.
   There will be original artwork by Schulz, excerpts from the more
than 40 Peanuts television shows and Snoopy mementos that were
carried aboard NASA's Apollo 10 mission.
   New York City will toast Schulz and his characters Oct. 24 with
a jazz concert at Carnegie Hall, featuring saxophonist Grover
Washington Jr. and bassist Ron Carter. The Peanuts TV special have
been noted for their original jazz scores.
   Opening Oct. 30 at the Smithsonian is ``This is Your Childhood,
Charlie Brown - Children in American Culture, 1945-1970,'' an
exhibit that looks at how Schulz's comic strips reflected childhood
and American culture after World War II.
   There will also be a ``Snoopy: The Universal Dog'' exhibit at
the Dog Museum in St. Louis, starting Nov. 11. A Peanuts exhibit is
now on display at the Museum of Cartoon Art in San Francisco.

   Frank Yatsu never thought he'd live to see his
government apologize for imprisoning him in World War II. But a
check carrying that message should arrive in a few days, just
before he turns 107.
   ``That's pretty good, I think,'' Yatsu said. ``The American
government treated us in a Christian way and it's pretty good.''
   The government soon will start sending $20,000 checks to each of
the surviving Japanese-Americans sent to internment camps during
the war. The last of the checks will be mailed in the federal
government's fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, 1992.
   It was unclear exactly when the checks would go out, but
officials said last week they hoped to begin issuing them in early
October if White House and congressional budget negotiators reached
agreement on a budget. That agreement was reached Sunday and
Congress approved a resolution to continue funding for federal
agencies, averting furloughs and cuts that could have delayed
issuing the checks.
   Mary Grace Jennings, a spokeswoman for the federal Office of
Redress Administration, said last week that officials hoped to have
the first checks out by Oct. 9.
   The office also has proposed that the checks be accompanied by a
letter of apology signed by President Bush and was working with the
White House toward that, she said.
   For many, the payments will do much to erase the shame of
internment and the decades of bitterness that followed, said
Cressey Nakagawa, president of the Japanese American Citizens
League, which led the fight for the reparations.
   ``I think, in many instances, people will even frame the
letter,'' Nakagawa said from his San Francisco office. ``The checks
will be consequential, but most meaningful will be the apology.''
   The government rounded up Japanese-Americans in 1942 after war
roke out with Japan, distrusting their loyalty. German-Americans
did not receive such treatment.
   About 120,000 people were forced to abandon nearly all their
possessions and were confined at 10 camps, most in remote inland
areas of the West, and at scattered hospitals and sanitariums.
   Among them was Robert Matsui, who was 6 months old when he, his
sister and parents were sent to a camp, despite all having been
born and raised in Sacramento, Calif. They spent four years as
internees.
   Matsui, now a Democratic congressman from California, sponsored
the repayment bill, with Rep. Norman Mineta, D-Calif., and Sens.
Daniel Inouye and Spark Matsunaga, both D-Hawaii.
   Passage of the measure ``was something of a catharsis'' for many
Japanese-Americans, Matsui said.
   ``It was an issue of shame for the longest time,'' he said.
``The shame of having been accused by your own government of
potentially being a spy. The worst thing that could happen to a
citizen is being accused of being disloyal to your neighbor.''
   It took years to square the experience in his own mind, Matsui
said.
   ``I was not able to deal with this issue for the longest time,
until about 1984 and 1985, when it really hit me that it really
wasn't my fault that we were in this camp, it was the government's
fault,'' he said.
   The tax-free checks will be distributed according to age, with
Yatsu and 84 other centenarians getting them first.
   Yatsu, whose birthday is Oct. 13, isn't the oldest. First in
line are a woman in Phoenix and a man in Santa Monica, Calif., both
107, said Bob Bratt, administrator of the Redress Administration.
   Yatsu and Harry Nakagawa, 100, are among five former internees
cared for by Seattle Keiro, a Japanese community nursing home, who
have lived more than a century. Both men remember the war years
well.
   Nakagawa, who immigrated to Seattle in 1905, had a successful
grocery with his son when he and his family were sent to a camp in
Minidoka, Idaho. He said his landlady let him keep his possessions
in the store's basement, but she died before his return and ``I
lost everything.'' He later worked in a hotel and private club in
Seattle.
   Yatsu, a teacher who immigrated to California in 1906, spent the
war at an Arizona camp. Afterward, he made his way to Seattle where
he worked for a window company.
   Yatsu said he would use his money to go live with a daughter in
San Diego. Nakagawa said he would donate some to the Buddhist and
Baptist churches.
   Both, speaking in a mix of English and Japanese translated by a
Seattle Keiro worker, said they were amazed and pleased the
government acknowledged its wrong.
   ``It's a good thing. . . . Other American people think we were
enemy people and they no like,'' Yatsu said.
   The payments were authorized by the Civil Liberties Act of 1988,
but $1.25 billion for the program wasn't allocated by Congress
until last October. Congress approved $500 million for 25,000
payments in fiscal 1990, the same amount the following year and the
remainder beginning in October 1992.
   That was based on estimates that about 65,000 internees were
alive in 1988, but Bratt said his office had found about 70,000,
nearly three-quarters of whom live in California.

<TEXT>
   Diplomats and watchdog groups Saturday
expressed dismay at the government's decision to ban a respected
magazine that advocated multiparty politics and attacked official
corruption.
   The Nairobi Law Monthly was the fourth publication banned by the
government of President Daniel arap Moi in the past two years.
   ``The publication has been an important forum for legal and
social commentary,'' said a spokesman at the U.S. Embassy in
Nairobi. ``We hope the banning would be reconsidered.''
   The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists called the
closing of the 3-year-old monthly ``the latest blow in a campaign
of intimidation and harassment aimed at this publication.''
   ``Its staff has been maligned, persecuted and jailed,'' the
group said in a statement to Moi, who has ruled Kenya for 12 years.
   Attorney General Matthew Muli signed the order Friday banning
the magazine, whose editor, Gitobu Imanyara, was detained for three
weeks in July and charged with sedition in July.
   ``The Nairobi Law Monthly is one of thw few remaining press
critics of Kenya's drift toward dictatorship,'' said a statement
from New York-based Africa Watch, a human rights monitoring group.
   The ban came two days after Moi threatened to crack down on
those calling for multiple political parties. A 1982 law allows
only Moi's Kenya African National Union party in the East African
nation of 23 million people.
   This week, Moi twice accused the Anglican Church of
destabilizing the country. Nine bishops denied the charges in a
statement Friday.
   The church and other critics have repeatedly decried alleged
corruption, election-rigging and abuses in the judiciary.
   The government said security forces killed 20 people in four
days or riots that followed the arrests of editor Imanyara, 36, and
six other people.
   Africa Watch claimed more than 100 people were killed in the
fighting.
   In the current issue of the Law Monthly, Imanyara called for
political pluralism. He also wrote in an editorial urging the
current Parliament be dissolved and new elections held, and that
Kenya's presidents should be impeached if they violate the
constitution.
   The September issue of the magazine sold more than 10,000 copies
in a few hours in Nairobi, Africa Watch said.

   A hotel bar where a gunman described as
a schizophrenic killed a man and kept patrons hostage during a
night of humiliation and terror reopened Saturday.
   Henry's Publick House &amp; Grille served a few dozen customers
after it reopened to a few gawkers, off-duty servers and some hotel
guests.
   Bullet holes were still visible from Thursday's siege in which
Iranian-born Mehrdad Dashti, 30, killed one young man and wounded
seven others before he died in a hail of police gunfire.
   Manager Doug Moore, one of 33 people held hostage, said he
returned to work because, ``I haven't been able to cry. I haven't
been able to feel anything.''
   The seven-hour siege, punctuated by Dashti's sporadic gunfire,
ended when police failed to talk him into surrenduring and officers
stormed the bar in the Durant Hotel.
   Dashti was described as a paranoid schizophrenic on an Alameda
County mental health form. Police called him deranged.

   A fire raced through a chemical plant

   The four-alarm blaze at the Tubilor Protectors of America plant
was still burning late Saturday, firefighters said.
   Montgomery County sheriff's officers ordered a one-mile area
around the plant to be evacuated, and extended the order to two
miles on the northwest side, which was downwind.
   ``The whole building is burning,'' said sheriff's spokeswoman
Debbie Yancy.
   The cause of the fire was not immediately determined.
   The plant, which processed several chemicals including the
flammable gas methyl chloride, is about 25 miles northwest of
Houston.

   CHALLIS, Idaho - A minor earthquake rattled dishes and left some
people's nerves shaken Saturday in east-central Idaho.
   The quake, measuring 3.9 on the Richter scale, occurred at 7:08
p.m. and was centered about 10 miles southwest of Challis, said
John Minsch, a geophysicist with the National Earthquake
Information Center in Golden, Colo.
   He said a 3.9 earthquake is minor and unlikely to cause damage.
   ``Most people said it scared them and shook them up a little
bit,'' said Mark Booker of radio station KSRA in Salmon, 58 miles
north of Challis.
   Saturday's temblor occurred on the same fault line as a 7.3
quake that killed two children in Challis and caused $4 million
damage in October 1983.

<NOTE>EDS: New throughout to reflect end of session, settlement of
capital gains and Social Security</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Top congressional and Bush administration
leaders, trying to stave off a chaotic shrinking of government
services, ended more than 12 hours of negotiations early Sunday
still without a final plan to reduce the federal deficit.
   All indications pointed to a final agreement. Sources said
negotiators disposed of two of the toughest issues - capital gains
tax cuts and higher taxes on Social Security recipients - by
removing them from the package.
   Negotiations will resume at midday Sunday - 12 hours before deep
cuts in many federal programs are due to take effect.
   Any tampering with Social Security a month before elections was
just too unpalatable to most Democrats and many Republicans,
congressional aides said.
   Apparently the biggest remaining obstacle to a final agreement
was determining how to enforce the proposed deficit reductions in
future years - that is, how to keep a new Congress in 1994, for
example, from reneging on the spending cuts.
   Aides said some who have been pushing hardest for a cut in the
capital gains tax had made clear they would rather postpone the
issue until next year rather than accept any of several
watered-down substitutes.
   ``There doesn't seem to be much life left in the issue this
year,'' one Republican aide said of the capital gains cut, which
has been a prime goal of President Bush since his 1988 election
campaign.
   An official traveling with the president in New York said he
could not confirm reports that the White House had dropped its
insistence on a cut in the capital gains tax rate.
   But the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
negotiators were discussing ``all sorts of alternatives,''
including indexing to protect people from being taxed on gains that
simply reflect inflation.
   ``It all depends on what they get for it,'' he said.
   A capital gains cut apparently fell victim to a Democratic
effort to portray the reduction as a windfall for the rich. About
80 percent of the benefit of a tax cut on capital gains, which are
investment profits, would go to those with incomes over $100,000 a
year.
   Negotiators were optimistic they would be able to agree on a
plan of targeted spending cuts and tax increases that would bring
the largest deficit reductions in history: $50 billion in the
budget year that begins Monday and another $450 billion over the
following five years.
   ``It may take until early tomorrow morning,'' House Speaker
Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., told reporters as the Saturday talks
began. ``I'm getting quite optimistic about it.''
   Failure could trigger $85 billion in arbitrary cuts in many
federal programs and forced furloughs of 1 million or more workers
beginning Monday morning. The problem is made worse by the fact
that Congress has yet to pass any of the 13 annual appropriation
bills that pay for government programs in the new year.
   The House and Senate scheduled Sunday sessions in anticipation
that their leaders would reach agreement on a deficit-reduction
plan. If all goes according to schedule, the two chambers would
approve stopgap legislation extending government spending authority
temporarily and President Bush would sign it Sunday night.
   That would give lawmakers a few days to write a bill cutting
spending and raising taxes to produce the deficit reduction.
   As negotiators convened on Saturday, aides gave conflicting
reports on the status of the capital gains cut, which has been the
most contentious issue in the more than four months of bargaining.
   ``I would not want to preclude it at this time,'' Foley said
Saturday when asked if the capital gains proposal was still an
option. He said the whole question of growth incentives and tax
fairness - whether the rich should pay more - was still open.
   He and Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas said
negotiators were considering alternative ways of stimulating
investment. Aides said those options include a limited deduction
for long-held investments in smaller companies.
   By the time the session ended, however, the touchy capital gains
issue had been put aside.
   That left another hot issue: whether Social Security
beneficiaries should be required to shoulder a bigger portion of
the cost of deficit reduction. In the end, the negotiators
apparently said no.
   Democrats had proposed to raise from 50 percent to 85 percent
the taxable portion of Social Security benefits received by those
with higher incomes. Republicans favor a two- or three-month delay
in the cost-of-living increase in Social Security benefits that is
due to take effect next January.
   Leaders in both parties say either solution is likely to
undermine support for the deficit-reduction package from lawmakers
who remember the flood of mail from retirees last year that forced
repeal of a catastrophic illness health plan for seniors and the
tax increases that paid for it.
   The negotiators agreed earlier on large parts of the $500
billion package. It includes increases in taxes on beer, wine,
liquor and gasoline; a new ``luxury'' tax on high-priced cars,
jewels and electronic equipment; a slight tax on all forms of
energy; $120 billion of cuts in domestic spending, and a $170
billion reduction in the military budget.

   A plane performing acrobatics crashed
into a northern California lake Saturday, and officials said at
least six people on board were killed.
   As many as 10 people may have been on the plane and there were
no known survivors, said Craig Doan, air traffic specialist with
the Federal Aviation Administration in nearby Ukiah.
   Authorities suspended the search shortly before midnight, and
planned to resume Sunday.
   The Korean War-vintage PIIV twin engine plane crashed into the
west end of Clear Lake, about 50 yards from shore, said Doan. Clear
Lake is about 100 miles north of San Francisco.
   FAA authorities in Los Angeles said they believe 10 people were
aboard, but they had not confirmed that number, Doan said. Another
FAA official in Ukiah, Bev Clark, later said six fatalities had
been confirmed. She said divers were searching for other possible
victims.
   The pilot was buzzing seaplanes meeting at the ``fly-in''
sponsored by the Skylark Motel, witnesses said. The aircraft was
not part of the seaplane convention, a spokeswoman for the motel
said.
   The owner of the plan was not immediately know, Lakeport
sheriff's said.
   An investigator from the National Transportation Safety Board
was to arrive Sunday from Los Angeles, along with officials from
FAA Flight Standards in Sacramento, the FAA said.
   Witnesses watching the seaplane ``fly-in'' said the pilot was
buzzing planes in the water and then did a barrel roll and crashed,
leaving only 1 foot of the craft visible above water.
   ``It didn't look like a seaplane. When it would go by, he would
put a cloud of smoke nd then go away and straight up through the
sky. This guy we were sitting with said, `He can't do that in that
kind of plane,''' said Debbie Fields, owner of On the Waterfront
boat rental.
   The plane leveled off and then ``did something similar to a
barrel roll. There was no hope for him then; he went straight
down,'' Fields added.
   The plane is a large patrol aircraft used in anti-submarine
warfare, Doan said. Authorities had not determined the
identification number or where the craft was based, he said.

   The Soviet Union and South Korea on Sunday
will announce plans to establish diplomatic relations, South Korean
diplomats said.
   The South Korean diplomats said their foreign minister, Choi
Ho-joong, and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze would
make the announcement after their meeting at the United Nations.
   The diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said no date
had been set for establishment of ties, but it would be soon,
possibly as early as November.
   Soviet diplomats said only that the Soviet-Korean meeting would
be ``important.''
   South Korea has been pushing for ties with the Soviet Union, a
long-time ally and friend of its rival North Korea, one of the last
bastions of hardline Communism, resisting the worldwide wave of
democratic movements.
   The Soviet Union, which is undergoing political liberalization,
also has been improving its relations with South Korea, and the
Moscow government is eager for enhanced trade and economic
cooperation to help bolster the Soviet economy.
   The two Koreas have been arch-enemies since the Korean peninsula
was divided after World War II. They fought a 1950-53 war, and
hundreds of thousands of troops are positioned along their border.
   The move is expected to enhance a South Korean bid to join the
United Nations. Communist North Korea has opposed separate entry of
the two nations on the divided peninsula and says separate
admission would only reaffirm division.
   North Korea and South Korea currently hold non-voting observer
status at the United Nations.
   The Soviet decision would leave China as North Korea's most
powerful Communist ally. But China, too, has been cautiously
improving its relations with South Korea and also is interested in
South Korean investment and technology.
   South Korean diplomats have said they would only seek U.N.
admission if they are certain that China, a permanent member of the
Security Council with veto power, would not oppose them.
   With the crumbling of the Soviet Bloc, more Eastern European
nations are seeking normalization of relations with South Korea.

   Congressional leaders said they have all but
reached a tentative agreement with the Bush administration to slash
$500 billion off the federal deficit, a deal that would stave off a
chaotic shrinking of government services on Monday, officials said
Sunday.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the budget
negotiators have resolved all the tax questions and other issues
but still have some questions about reforming the budget process
that they need to discuss with Bush.
   Fitzwater said only technical questions remained to be resolved.
He said the president will meet with negotiators at 12:30 p.m. ``to
hopefully conclude that final issue and get an agreement after
that.''
   Bush has insisted all along that he wanted the budget deal to
include long-term reform that will tighten controls on the
budgetary process.
   Other officials said negotiators disposed of two of the toughest
issues - capital gains tax cuts and higher taxes on Social Security
recipients - by removing them from the package.
   ``They're done, gone,'' said one Democratic participant who
demanded anonymity.
   President Bush was scheduled to fly back to Washington from New
York by early afternoon. He had been in New York to deliver
speeches and to meet with foreign officials.
   Bargainers were gathering in the Capitol Sunday morning to try
to nail down the final details of the agreement. Still outstanding
were procedural questions about how to guarantee agreed-on spending
limits in the last several years of the five-year package.
   Without a deal, deep cuts in many federal programs are due to
take effect Monday.
   White House officials said privately Saturday night that if the
president returned to the nation's capital, it would be to put the
final seal on the major deficit cutting deal he and congressional
leaders have been seeking for more than four months.
   The officials said Bush would leave for Washington after
speaking to the United Nations children's summit. He was traveling
on a small Air Force jet and planned to later return to New York,
where he had meetings scheduled with nine foreign heads of state.
   Bush's move came after congressional and White House leaders
worked into the early morning hours in search of a
deficit-reduction agreement that would avert widespread curtailment
of government services Monday morning.
   The negotiators planned to return later in the day.
   ``We've made a lot of progress. We just don't have a deal yet,''
Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole said early Sunday at the end of a
13-hour negotiating session.
   A spokesman for House Speaker Thomas S. Foley described the
previous 24 hours as the most successful since these talks began in
May.
   Talks were scheduled to resume at midday. If an agreement is
reached, the House and Senate would consider stopgap legislation
later in the day to give the government new spending authority for
the budget year that begins Monday and to postpone furloughs of
federal workers and cuts in government services for three or four
days.
   White House officials had previously indicated Bush would return
to Washington to announce his backing for an agreement if one were
reached.
   Democratic and Republican leaders have acknowledged that the
deficit-reduction plan they are writing will be unpopular. But they
are betting lawmakers will swallow hard and accept it as better
than the alternative of deep, arbitrary cuts in many programs.
   During the Saturday session, aides said, negotiators agreed to
eliminate from the package a proposed increase in the portion of
Social Security benefits subject to income tax.
   Democratic negotiators especially had been cautioned by party
members that they could not accept such a tax increase on retirees.
   The bargainers also put aside President Bush's proposed tax cut
on capital gains, which are profits from the sale of investments.
Democrats insisted they could not accept that reduction - whose
benefits would go chiefly to higher-income Americans - unless other
taxes on those same people were raised to make up the difference.
   The package would reduce the deficit by about $50 billion during
the budget year that begins Monday and by another $450 billion
during the following four years.
   Key parts of the package would:
   -Raise taxes on gasoline, all forms of energy, cigarettes,
liquor, wine, beer and airline tickets.
   -Impose a new 10 percent tax on part of the price of expensive
cars, electronic equipment, furs, jewelry and other ``luxuries.''
   -Boost the monthly premium retirees pay for Medicare doctors'
services.
   -Cut military spending by $170 billion over five years.
   -Reduce outlays for education, space, the court system and many
other programs by $120 billion.
   Early today Bush and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
attended a service in a private chapel at St. Bartholomew's
Episcopal Church, a landmark Byzantine edifice just across the
street from the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, where the president is
staying in New York.

   A powerful tropical storm swept through western and

said.
   The tropical storm was downgraded from Typhoon Gene, which had
winds of up to 86 miles per hour before it landed in western Japan
Sunday morning, they said.
   Airline and railway officials said more than 200,000 people were
affected by the cancellation of flights and train service as the
tropical storm struck near Chiba, 21 miles east of Tokyo.
   The storm, with maximum winds of 43 mph, was heading northeast
along Japan's Pacific coast, weather forecasters said.
   A National Police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said 23 houses were destroyed by wind and landslides and more than
4,000 others were flooded throughout the country.
   Among the hardest hit was Miyazaki prefecture on Japan's
southern island of Kyushu, where two people were killed when their
houses were destroyed by landslides and another died after falling
into a river, the official said.
   A 49-year-old man was killed in a landslide in Shizuoka, 90
miles west of Tokyo, he said.
   A Japan Railways official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said fierce winds and rain forced the railroad to cancel 96
high-speed ``bullet'' trains on the line between Tokyo and Osaka.
The official said many local trains also were halted by the rain.
   All Nippon Airways canceled 90 domestic flights and Japan
Airlines canceled 10 flights from Tokyo's Haneda airport, airline
officials said.
   The Maritime Safety Agency, Japan's coast guard, said there were
no reports of damage to ships.

   Troy and Trina Kinast have to watch what
they say around their 3-year-old son.
   Seth Kinast, according to his parents, can already recite the
Greek alphabet, say the English alphabet forward and backward,
count in Spanish, German and English, read at a second-grade level,
identify countries on a globe, recite the books of the New
Testament and keep up with adult conversations.
   Seth began saying ``Mommy'' and ``Daddy'' at about 8 months. At
16 months, he named the letters of the alphabet. At 22 months, he
read magazine headlines at a grocery store, the Kinasts said.
   The couple read books to the unborn child because they heard it
could stimulate letter and sound recognition. After Seth was born,
they read or sang to him as they rocked him to sleep.
   ``Now we read to him before naps and bedtime,'' Kinast said.
``He has a stack of books by his bed, and he reads to himself.
Sometimes at 11:30 p.m., we have to tell him to quit, but he always
says, `Just one more.'''
   More than 800 books line the shelves in Seth's bedroom.
   Recently, Seth and his grandmother were getting ready to play
``Sorry!'' when his grandmother realized she didn't have her
glasses. Seth read her the rules from the game box, Kinast said.
   The Kinasts already have decided to teach Seth at home and
provide lessons in piano and organ. And they're beginning to teach
younger brother Nathan, 8 months old. Kinast is a math instructor
at Wichita State University; Mrs. Kinast stays home with the
children.
   He said he and his wife are not overdrilling Seth or forcing him
to learn things against his will.
   ``It's like a game,'' he said. ``He learned the ABC song, and
then we learned the letters backward by putting them to the song.
... When we doodle, we doodle shapes, letters and designs. When we
play hide and seek, we count in German.''

   A bus carrying elderly French tourists
veered off a highway and into a gully Sunday, killing six
passengers and injuring 24, police said.
   Thirteen of the injured were seriously hurt and taken to nearby

   The group had spent the night in Andorra, a tiny country wedged
between France and Spain. The crash occurred near Perpignan, a city

   According to police, the bus driver reported that the brake
system began to fail and the bus skidded along a soft shoulder of
the road before plunging about 16 feet down an embankment. The

<HEAD>Prospect of U.S. Ground Offensive Seen To Be Still Weeks Away</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the first days after President Bush ordered
American troops into the Persian Gulf, Washington was awash with
speculation about the size of the deployment: 10,000 troops?
50,000?
   Now, with Operation Desert Shield into its ninth week, the
magnitude of the U.S. military buildup is clear: roughly
165,000-plus soldiers, sailors and airmen; 420 warplanes; 50
warships. And it's still growing.
   Even with this formidable presence, military analysts say it
will be another few weeks before the Pentagon has arrayed enough
heavy armor to launch a successful ground offensive against Iraq.
   Complicating the military equation is the continued buildup of
Iraqi forces in Kuwait and southern Iraq - estimated by the
Pentagon to total 430,000 men as of Sept. 25.
   ``We're a long way from having any capability to do anything
other than behave in a defensive way,'' said Jack Merritt, a
retired Army general and former U.S. representative to the NATO
Military Committee.
   In ordering U.S. forces to Saudi Arabia on Aug. 7, Bush said
their mission was to deter an Iraqi attack on the desert kingdom
and, in the event the Iraqis invaded, to defend the Saudi oil
fields.
   The president has not ruled out an offensive strike to try to
dislodge Iraqi forces from Kuwait, and Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney said Friday it seemed increasingly likely that Saddam
Hussein woul  lash out with military force in response to the U.N.
trade embargo against his export-dependent country.
   American forces currently are deployed in defensive positions in
and around Saudi Arabia.
   Three U.S. Marine formations totalling more than 45,000
personnel are in position along Saudi Arabia's gulf coastline, and
three Army heavy armored units - two brigades of the 24th
Mechanized Infantry Division, plus the 197th Mechanized Infantry
Brigade - are fully deployed in defensive positions in northeastern
Saudi Arabia.
   These components, which currently form the backbone of U.S.
ground forces in Saudi Arabia, are greatly outnumbered by personnel
and heavy armor on the Iraqi side.
   ``I suspect it'll be the first of November before there is
really an offensive capability'' by the American forces, said James
Blackwell, a military analyst at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, a Washington think tank.
   The U.S. Air Force already has gained numerical superiority over
Iraq. There are at least 420 U.S. warplanes - including 14 F-111
long-range bombers and 22 F-117A stealth fighter-bombers - deployed
at about 30 bases in and around Saudi Arabia.
   The overwhelming U.S. air power facing Iraqi forces is built
around Airborne Warning and Control System planes that carry a
saucer-like radar above the fuselage and communications devices
that link the field of battle into a single picture.
   Five American and five Saudi AWACS are in the area now. The U.S.
Navy also has several Hawkeyes, similar aircraft that take off from
aircraft carriers to perform radar and communications roles.
   The U.S. naval fleet in the region totals about 50 vessels,
including four aircraft carriers. The battleship USS Wisconsin,
armed with 32 Tomahawk cruise missiles, is in the gulf, and an
estimated eight nuclear submarines are lurking in the area.
   The Army, Air Force and Navy also have placed special operations
forces in the gulf. These forces are trained in unconventional
warfare tactics such as sabotage.
   Also arrayed against Iraq are a variety of ground, air and naval
forces from more than 20 other countries, including Britain,
France, Egypt, Syria and Morocco.
   Blackwell said the sealift of American military hardware is
running at least a couple of weeks behind schedule, mainly because
of breakdowns by transport ships. Even so, additional ground units
are beginning to arrive in Saudi Arabia, including:
   -The 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment from Fort Bliss, Texas, which
is equipped with hundreds of M-1 Abrams tanks and Bradley Fighting
Vehicles. The lead elements of the 4,500-man unit left for Saudi
Arabia on Wednesday, according to Fort Bliss spokesman Brad Rose.
The full unit should be there within two weeks.
   -One brigade of the ``Hell on Wheels'' 2nd Armored Division,
totaling about 3,000 soldiers, from Fort Hood, Texas, began heading
for the Saudi desert last week, according to base spokesman Maj.
Jesse Seigal. All are expected to meet up with their equipment,
which is arriving by sea, within 10 days.
   -Two brigades of the 1st Cavalry Division, totaling about 6,000
soldiers, also from Fort Hood, began leaving for Saudi Arabia last
week and the full force should be in place there in about 10 days.
   -Also en route to Saudi Arabia from Fort Hood are at least 2,000
members of the 13th Corps Support Command and several hundred
members each from the 15th Military Intelligence Battalion and the
89th Military Police Brigade, Seigal said.
   The earliest U.S. ground forces sent to Saudi Arabia were the
82nd Airborne Division from Fort Bragg, N.C., and the 101st
Airborne Division from Fort Campbell, Ky. They are the two most
rapidly deployable of the Army's major units.
   The Pentagon has announced no intention of deploying additional
Army divisions. Of the U.S.-based forces, the only major units
still available for heavy ground operations in Saudi Arabia would
be the 1st Infantry Division from Fort Riley, Kan.; the 4th
Infantry Division from Fort Carson, Colo.; and the 5th Infantry
Division from Fort Polk, La.

   A rapist says his life was ruined by a
judge who called the victim a ``pitiful woman'' as he rejected a
prison sentence worked out in a plea bargain.
   ``He has created a living hell for me,'' said Mark Edward
McCulloch, who accepted a 4{-year prison term offered by
prosecutors but was placed on probation for two years. ``I was
ready to go to jail.''
   McCulloch now fears for his safety, saying, ``I can't walk out
of the door without fear of losing my life. He put me at risk.
Anyone can take a shot at me.''
   Gov. Bob Martinez and others called for the resignation of
Seminole Circuit Judge Kenneth Leffler after the sentencing, but
the judge is returning to the bench Monday under a self-imposed
limit restricting his cases to civil suits.
   McCulloch rented a room from the victim, a 40-year-old
Casselberry woman, for two years and accepted full responsibility
for the rape April 9. The woman said her tenant became infatuated
and obsessed with her.
   Leffler, who presided over the woman's 1987 divorce trial, said
at the sentencing, ``I'm almost of the belief that she is a
victimizer of men.''

   RENO, Nev. (AP) - Her court case against Judas Priest may not
have been a hit with the judge, but lawyer Vivian Lynch is hoping a
new country song she penned will reach the top of the charts.
   Lynch recently represented the families of two Sparks, Nev.,
youths who shot themselves after listening to a record by the
English heavy metal rock band. The families contended subliminal
messages were responsible for the deaths of their sons, but Washoe
District Judge Jerry Whitehead ruled against them Aug. 24.
   A self-described amateur guitarist-songwriter, Lynch said she
wrote the song ``No More Deadly Music'' in 20 minutes immediately
after losing the Judas Priest case.
   The song takes aim at themes of drugs, sex and violence. One
verse goes: ``I won't sing of lust or violence, talk of crack or
speed or weed. I won't tell you death's the answer, or sing of
wicked Satan's creed.''
   Lynch, 50, said the song is in the hands of a Nashville music
lawyer.
   ``I have been assured that somebody probably will record it,''
she said.

   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) - Archbishop Desmond Tutu says South
African President F.W. de Klerk deserves praise for progress in
dismantling apartheid.
   ``He has been remarkably courageous, and it would be churlish to
say that he does not deserve to be praised. And I have been
praising him all over the place,'' Tutu said. He made his comments
after a speech to 1,400 members of the Puerto Rican Bar Association
at their annual meeting Saturday.
   But the prelate urged the United States to retain economic
sanctions until the major pillars of apartheid are removed.
   ``Sanctions must remain until the process is irreversible,''
Tutu said. ``It is economic sanctions that have brought us to the
point we have reached.''
   Tutu, leader of the 2.6 million-member Anglican Church of the
Province of Southern Africa and winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace
Prize, arrived Friday for a weekend visit to Puerto Rico and the
Virgin Islands.
   On Sunday, he celebrated a communion service with a Spanish,
English and African flavor at Puerto Rico's Episcopal Cathedral and
had lunch with Puerto Rico Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Singer Kenny Loggins is asking $14 million
for his nearly 20-acre estate in the exclusive Santa Barbara County
community of Montecito, according to a published report.
   Loggins, whose new album ``Leap of Faith'' is due out early next
year, and his wife, Eva, have filed for divorce, ending their
12-year marriage, the Los Angeles Times said Sunday.
   They had the home built two years ago after touring Italy with
their architect, Barry Berkus. Berkus built the compound to take
advantage of the ocean and mountain views.
   The compound 100 miles northwest of Los Angeles features a
nine-bedroom villa with 10{ bathrooms, five kitchens, three laundry
rooms, seven fireplaces and garages for six cars.
   In addition to the 8,500-square-foot main house, there is a
guest house, pool house, caretaker's cottage, sports complex and
kennel. The property also has a well, stream, pool, pond, spa, two
waterfalls and fountains.

   More than 22,000 Filipino civilian
employees at six U.S. military bases went on strike Sunday over
pay.
   They were protesting wage ceilings mandated by the U.S. Congress
that they said violated their collective bargaining agreement.
   The Federation of Filipino Civilian Employees Association
decided on the strike Sept. 18 after U.S. authorities refused to
implement a promised 18 percent pay increase.
   After the collective bargaining agreement was reached earlier
this year, Congress imposed a 3 percent ceiling on pay increases
for federal employees, including those outside the United States,
in a budget-cutting measure.
   A U.S. spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. Kevin Mukri, said the U.S. military
had drafted contingency plans in case of a strike but he did not
elaborate.
   The Pacific Stars and Stripes newspaper, an unofficial
publication of the U.S. military, said the command had advertised
for dependents and retired service members to fill the labor pool.

   Amy Ritter couldn't have dreamed of a better
birthday present - the return of her long-lost pooch, Maggie, who
had been given up for dead nearly two years ago.
   The child, who turns 10 on Wednesday, was reunited with her pup
Saturday after her father stumbled across the pet playing behind a
Glendale junk shop with its most recent owner - a homeless man. The
family live in an unincorporated area near Glendale.
   Thomas Ritter knew the dog was his daughter's when he spotted an
old BB-pellet wound in the dog's neck.
   After paying the panhandler $10 for his troubles, Ritter took
Maggie back, brought her to the vet, cleaned her up and brought her
home.
   ``All I could do was just stare at her,'' said Amy. ``I didn't
know what to think.''
   Despite a bad eye infection and being worn out after 21 months
of street living, Maggie instantly recognized Amy, leaping into her
arms and licking her face.
   Amy had been heartbroken about the loss of her puppy.
   ``She never got over it,'' her father said. ``Every time someone
says they saw a `Benji-type' dog, which is just what Maggie looked
like, I ... had to check it out.
   ``We just think the Lord is watching over us, if you want to
know the truth. Otherwise, something like this just could never

<HEAD>NASA Trying for Another Launch, with Another Shuttle</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   After months of embarrassing
failures, NASA will try again this week to launch a shuttle, this
time with a nuclear-powered satellte that will study the sun's
uncharted poles.
   Optimism abounds, and with some reason: The shuttle scheduled to
lift off Saturday morning - Discovery - is the most recent
spaceship to have flown and the only one in which fuel leaks have
not been found.
   ``Right now, I don't even feel weather can hold us up because
we've been just doing everything right on time,'' said astronaut
Bruce Melnick, one of five men assigned to the upcoming mission.
   Columbia has been grounded by dangerous hydrogen leaks since
May, Atlantis since June. NASA tried four times to send Columbia on
an astronomy mission before stopping two weeks ago to make way for
Discovery's high-priority flight.
   NASA has until Oct. 23 to launch Discovery with the European sun
probe, named for the legendary Greek adventurer Ulysses. Otherwise,
the $750 million mission will have to be put on hold for 13 months,
when Earth is aligned properly again with the sun and Jupiter.
   The four-day mission already is more than four years late. It
originally was scheduled for May 1986, but was delayed indefinitely
following the Challenger explosion earlier that year.
   The fact that Discovery has ``a real clean history'' is
encouraging, said astronaut Tom Akers.
   Discovery's April flight that put the Hubble Space Telescope
into orbit was smooth and trouble-free. The mission's success was
overshadowed two months later, however, by discovery of a defective
mirror on the $1.5 billion telescope.
   New fuel lines have been installed between the orbiter and
external tank, the area where hydrogen leaked in the other two
shuttles, NASA officials said. But little work was performed in
Discovery's engine compartment following the last flight, lessening
the likelihood that any repair work has caused any damage.
   ``I don't have any problems at all worrying about the vehicle,''
said Akers, who like Melnick will be making his first shuttle
flight. ``The most apprehension that I feel is on my own personal
performance. I want to make sure I don't mess up.''
   Six hours into the flight, as Discovery orbits 184 miles above
Earth, Akers will switch on the system releasing the satellite from
the cargo bay.
   A series of rapid engine firings will send the 807-pound
spacecraft hurtling toward Jupiter at a speed of 34,450 mph, making
it the fastest manmade object in relation to Earth. Ulysses is
expected to reach Jupiter in February 1992.
   The giant planet's gravity will whip Ulysses into an
unprecedented orbit over the solar poles. The closest the
spacecraft will come to the sun is about 120 million miles - 27
million miles farther away from the sun than it is now on the
launch pad.
   Ulysses is expected to pass over the sun's south pole in 1994
and the north pole the following year.
   ``Almost anything we learn with Ulysses will be real learning.
It's new. We've never been there before,'' said Edgar Page,
Ulysses' science coordinator for the European Space Agency, which
is conducting the mission with NASA.
   Scientists plan to examine the sun's corona and magnetic field
and solar wind and flares. So far, measurements have been made only
over the sun's equator.
   To reach its destination, Ulysses will use electricity generated
from nearly 23.7 pounds of decaying plutonium-238. The only other
time such a generator has flown on a shuttle was in October 1989,
when Atlantis carried the Jupiter-bound Galileo into space.
   Environmental activists opposed to nuclear-powered spacecraft
asked a federal judge in Washington on Friday to stop the launch.
NASA, which says it has no other option, has until Tuesday to
respond.
   The activists contend a Challenger-like accident could shower
deadly plutonium over Florida. NASA officials insist the chance of
that happening is extremely small because of the generator's
numerous protective layers.
   NASA's Dudley McConnell, author of an environmental impact
statement on Ulysses, said there is a less than one in 1 million
chance of an accident that would result in a plutonium-related
death.
   The slight chance of such an accident odds won't keep the
astronauts' families away Saturday.
   ``My family is going to be down there in Florida standing
underneath Discovery waving goodbye as we go off the launch pad, so
I don't have any problems,'' said Discovery's commander Dick
Richards. ``I am confident in this system and that it doesn't
provide any hazard to anybody on the ground.''

<HEAD>Judges Say They're Overworked, Underpaid, Concerned About Security</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Overworked, underpaid compared with their peers in
private practice and facing increasing threats from drug
traffickers and disgruntled defendants, federal judges are facing a
crisis in the judiciary.
   The situation is so bad that veteran jurists are resigning and
the brightest lawyers are refusing to take their places, saying the
exalted status of a federal judge can't make up for what they
consider to be a life under siege.
   One of the most respected judges in the frantic Southern
District of Florida resigned last week, citing pressures and
finances.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas E. Scott of Miami decided to retire
from the bench at the age of 42 after five years as a circuit judge
and five more on the federal level.
   The departure of a man widely thought of as having one of the
top legal minds in Florida was taken as an ominous sign in Miami's
legal community.
   ``In losing Tom Scott, we're losing the equivalent of two
judges,'' said Chief District Judge James Lawrence King. ``If
Congress doesn't act soon, it will leave the judiciary of South
Florida tattered and torn.''
   Judicial workloads have more than doubled since 1969, with so
many drug cases clogging the courts that civil litigants must wait
years for a trial date.
   ``Nobody would have taken this job unless they anticipated
working very hard and being underpaid, but there are limits,'' said
Chief Judge Thomas C. Platt of the Eastern District in New York,
where where 12 judges grappled with 1,010 new criminal cases this
year, or more than 84 new cases each.
   According to figures from the Judicial Conference of the United
States, only six federal judges resigned or retired from the bench
from 1958 to 1973. But from 1974 to 1988, 59 federal judges left
the bench.
   Across the nation, some judges live under armed guard 24 hours a
day, and at least 295 threats against federal judges have been made
since October 1989, according to the U.S. Marshals Service.
   Judge Scott will more than double his $96,600 salary after he
joins the Miami law firm of Steel, Hector and Davis on Oct. 31. But
he said his comparative pay as a judge was only one of his
frustrations.
   In his resignation speech Thursday, Scott appealed for more
support for judges in the war on drugs, calling them ``unsung
heroes in an ongoing ordeal.''
   ``Constantly at odds with a Congress that does not address its
needs and problems ... they face a daily struggle against threats
of physical violence, overburdened crime calendars and limited
resources,'' he said.
   While authorities believe a racial extremist was responsible for
the package bomb that killed 11th Circuit Judge Robert Vance in
Georgia last December, judges in Florida are more concerned with
international criminals who are used to terrorizing or bribing
judges in their own countries, Scott said in a recent interview.
   ``When you enter into the world of drug traffickers and the
money and violence they represent, it's very scary,'' said Scott,
who drives a different route home each day from the federal
courthouse in Miami.
   ``There doesn't have to be a threat,'' he added. ``You know that
one day, one of these decisions is going to come back to haunt
you.''
   Neal Sonnett, the immediate past president of the National
Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, said Scott's departure is
a symbol of how drug cases have overwhelmed the system.
   ``He worked enormously hard, and this district is the busiest in
the country,'' Sonnett said. ``(But) all the judges down here spend
70-80 percent of their time on drug cases. That's bound to wear on
you.''
   The Bush administration is expanding U.S. attorneys' offices
nationwide, but judges say the federal bench hasn't grown to meet
the demand in criminal and civil matters, especially in drug-entry
states like Florida, Texas, California and New York.
   The load could be eased in some districts under a Senate
proposal to create 77 new judgeships and reduce the costs and
delays of civil litigation. The bill, sponsored by Judiciary
Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., and Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.,
passed the committee in July.
   Federal judge's salaries are also due for a rise - to $120,800
in 1991, if the Gulf crisis and deficit-reduction battles don't
prompt Congress to rescind the pay raise.
   Sonnett said holding down salaries would only exacerbate a
``double-barreled problem.''
   ``The best judges are starting to leave, and the best lawyers
are no longer interested in taking their place,'' he said. ``You
run the risk of reducing the quality of the federal bench, and
allowing politics to creep in. The federal judiciary should be
above that.''

   David Souter may be able to maintain his
modest lifestyle as a Supreme Court justice, but there's no doubt
that moving from Weare, N.H., to Washington, D.C., will require
some adjustments.
   If confirmed by the Senate this month as expected, Souter will
go from a community of 6,000 to a metropolitan area of more than
2.5 million, from negligible crime to one of the nation's highest
murder rates. And most important to Souter, from privacy into the
public eye.
   ``Do you think that this guy who lives on a dirt road in Weare,
New Hampshire, can possibly understand the problems of modern
society?'' longtime friend Bill Glahn said in a parody of attitudes
he's encountered.
   Early media portraits of Souter after his nomination to the
Supreme Court focused on his unmown lawn, old car and paint-chipped
mailbox. Weekly visits to his mother were noted, as was his
bachelor status.
   Many observers were concerned that his writings as a state judge
didn't shed enough light on how he would vote on federal
constitutional issues. They worried that living in a state with no
big cities and few minorities had sheltered Souter from such
realities as AIDS, discrimination and urban crime. Both liberals
and conservatives called him a risk.
   Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., said the early media zoom lens on
Souter created a phony image that changed during the confirmation
hearings.
   ``To some extent, what those stories demonstrated was what I
consider to be the arrogance of this city and the media, who
unfortunately have become part of the establishment and don't know
it,'' Rudman said in a telephone interview from Washington.
   Glahn, a Manchester lawyer, acknowledged that Souter's
Weare-to-Washington transfer will require adjustments.
   ``Where he is there's no noise at night - sometimes no lights at
night - no safety problems,'' said Glahn. ``For David to drive from
Weare to Concord, there are probably two stop lights.''
   Glahn said remaining in the public eye may be the most difficult
thing for Souter to become accustomed to.
   ``He becomes of necessity a public figure,'' Glahn said. ``He's
a very private man, and a very humble man. I don't think he likes
the notoriety.''
   Souter leaves his Weare farmhouse, valued at around $150,000,
for one of the nation's most expensive housing markets. His salary
as an associate justice will be $118,600 and will increase to
$148,300 in January.
   As a judge on the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston,
where he served since May, Souter received $102,000 annually.
   All but one of the U.S. Supreme Court justices live in the
Virginia suburbs of Washington, where four-bedroom homes in
desirable areas average $300,000-$500,000 and can go well above the
$1 million mark.
   Rudman said Souter initially will find a place near the court,
presumably on Capitol Hill, so he can concentrate on work.
   Souter, Rudman said, will maintain the same ascetic lifestyle.
   ``David Souter is not going to change. He's not going to start
being on the Style pages of The Washington Post,'' Rudman said. ``I
can tell you that David Souter wants to live a very quiet and
modest life down here.''
   An avid hiker, Souter, bereft of New Hampshire's White
Mountains, probably will find solace in Virginia's nearby Blue
Ridge range, Rudman said.
   Leaving friends will be difficult, Glahn said, even though
Souter knows plenty of people in Washington. Souter, 51, may miss
the closeness of New Hampshire communities, Glahn said.
   ``Everyone knows you. If you go to a store or restaurant, they
know what you want for dinner,'' Glahn said. ``Those are the kinds
of things they take for granted in a small town.''
   Souter's Sunday visits to his mother, who lives in a retirement
community in Concord, will be less frequent. Round-trip airfare
starts at about $207. Glahn said Helen Souter, 82, will miss her
son, but ``it will be a physical separation. ... She's not
concerned about it.''

<HEAD>Proposal: Create Enclave Within Detroit With Own Police, Schools</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of developers wants to block out urban
crime by creating a town within the city, complete with its own
police force and a school system that would require weapons
searches and drug tests.
   The multimillion-dollar plan drafted by the developers called
Partnership to Reinvest in Detroit's Excellence (PRIDE) has yet to
be handed over to the city, but the mayor has expressed interest.
   The proposed new town, which would replace a crimbling
neighborhood about 2 miles east of downtown, would be a place
``where practical family values can flourish in an atmosphere free
of drugs, prostitution, pornography, gambling and other criminal
activities,'' the proposal says.
   Mayor Coleman Young met with the developers a few months ago and
asked for more details of the plan, city spokesman Bob Berg said
Sunday.
   ``He backs the concept but he has not gone over the specifics,''
Berg said. ``He has been saying that he supports the idea of
redeveloping that area.''
   Among the developers taking part in the project are major
companies such Michigan National Corp., a bank holding company; and
Walbridge Aldinger, a leading construction company.
   The 740-acre community would border along the Detroit River near
Belle Isle, according to the preliminary proposal obtained by The
Detroit News and described in Sunday's editions. It would include
the prime riverfront site of the former Uniroyal plant.
   The new town would be home to about 7,500 people and would have
a minigovernment - under the city of Detroit - with authority to
control the development and social programs, the plan says. The
town would have a separate police department, but it was uncertain
how the city would be involved in the hiring or running of the
force.
   It would also have its own school district that would require
checks for drugs and weapons.
   Several specifics were undetermined, including how the project
would be funded. The developers said they would need complete
cooperation with city, state and federal governments.
   The ``new town within a city'' concept was highlighted in a 1987
Detroit long-range plan, and Young has touted the idea for several
years.
   ``This is hope,'' said David Baker Lewis, who helped draft the
1987 plan. ``I don't think all the ideas are feasible or would be
embraced, but it's a start.''
   The plan says the city would be asked to demolish buildings,
relocate residents, clean up environmental hazards and relocate
roads and utilities. When that is completed, the developers want
the city to hand it over to them at no cost.

   Nearly 1,000 people forced from their
homes because of a fire at a nearby chemical plant were allowed to
return home early Sunday, authorities said.
   Explosions and flames broke out about 6 p.m. Saturday at the
Tubilor Protection of America plant, which makes polyvinyl chloride
thread protectors for pipes used in the oil business.
   Officials said the fire was allowed to burn itself out to
protect firefighters and to prevent chemical runoff.
   But fears of toxic fumes prompted authorities to order the
evacuations of up to 1,000 people living nearby. Montgomery County
officials said the residents were allowed to return home at about
1:30 a.m. Sunday.
   It was the Houston area's third industrial accident over the
weekend.
   A propane leak earlier Saturday at a Shell Oil plant in Deer
Park forced authorities to close a highway and order residents to
stay inside.
   And a Norwegian tanker rammed a barge in the Houston Ship
Channel late Friday, spilling nearly 30,000 gallons of partly
refined crude oil into the water. It had largly evaporated by
Sunday, but authorities said they would still have to test to see
if a solvent in the oil had contaminated oyster reefs in the bay.
   Firefighters from about a dozen area departments battled the
chemical plant blaze. Two firefighters who suffered smoke
inhalation were treated and released, officials said.
   Several chemicals, including the flammable gas methyl chloride,
are processed at the plant.
   Officials were investigating the cause of the fire at the
chemical plant about 6 miles south of Magnolia, which is about 30
miles northwest of Houston.

<HEAD>Search Continues For Victims In California Plane Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAKEPORT, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A search resumed Sunday for the seventh
victim of a plane crash that occurred when an uninvited aircraft
appeared at a pilots' convention, gave an impromptu aerobatics
display and plunged into a lake.
   Divers removed six bodies from the wreckage of the World War II
Navy patrol plane, which broke apart on impact in Clear Lake before
hundreds of stunned spectators Saturday afternoon.
   Believing a seventh person had been aboard, divers renewed the
search Sunday morning, and authorities said they would try to pull
the plane from the mud and murky water.
   Just before the crash, the bulky twin-engine Lockheed P2V
Harpoon made four low passes over the crowd on the shore and the
floating seaplanes meeting for the annual ``Seaplane Fly-In.'' The
lake is about 100 miles north of San Francisco.
   ``When it would go by, he would put a cloud of smoke and then go
away and straight up through the sky,'' said Debbie Fields, owner
of a boat rental business. ``This guy we were sitting with said,
`He can't do that in that kind of plane.'''
   The plane, believed to date from 1945, was not part of the
seaplane convention, said Walter Windus, vice president of the
Seaplane Pilots Association, an event sponsor.
   ``He was strictly an intruder,'' said Windus, who saw the crash.
``He saw an opportunity to show off and he took advantage of it. He
was doing air maneuvers that were not appropriate to that type of
aircraft.''
   Convention organizers, he added, tried desperately to contact
the pilot of the mystery plane by radio, planning to tell him to
leave, but could not reach him.
   ``His behavior was so obnoxious,'' Windus said. ``I was going to
tell him to go away or I was going to report him to the FAA.''
   On its last pass, the plane ``did something similar to a barrel
roll,'' Fields said, adding: ``There was no hope for him then. He
went straight down.''
   The plane crashed nose-first into six feet of water about 50
yards offshore on the lake's west end, said Walt Smith, a Federal
Aviation Administration official based in nearby Santa Rosa. There
were no survivors, he said.
   An investigator from the National Transportation Safety Board
arrived from Los Angeles on Sunday morning.
   The plane had taken off from the Sonoma County Airport in Santa
Rosa, south of Lake County, the Los Angeles Times quoted an
unidentified FAA investigator as saying. Seven people were believed
to be aboard, the newspaper said. Earlier reports had put the
number on board to as many as 10.
   The names of the dead were not released, but officials told the
paper the pilot was from Santa Rosa.
   Scott Landis, an amphibious-plane pilot from Long Beach
attending the convention, said it appeared the Harpoon pilot may
have pulled the nose of the plane up too high on the final pass,
causing a stall.
   The plane ``turned over and the nose fell back toward the lake.
The pilot tried to pull it out (of the dive) but there wasn't
enough room,'' said Landis, who estimated the plane was between
1,500 and 2,000 feet when the nose dropped.
   ``He hit the water at between 150 and 200 miles per hour,
probably,'' he added. ``The plane disintegrated.''

<HEAD>Ukrainians March For Independence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of Ukrainian nationalists
marched Sunday through Kiev, the republic's capital, calling for
greater independence from the central government in Moscow.
   ``Mother Moscow: We want to be orphans,'' declared a banner held
aloft by cheering protesters as they streamed along the city's main
street, the Kreshchatik.
   The Ukraine is one of 13 Soviet republics that have taken steps
toward greater autonomy from Moscow. The only one that has declared
immediate independence is Lithuania.
   The Ukraine is the second-largest Soviet republic, after Russia,
and is a key grain-growing area. Its parliament has declared
sovereignty from Moscow and claims the right to overrule national
laws.
   But nationalist groups want it to go further and take rapid
moves toward secession.
   On Sunday, Interior Ministry troops in armored personnel
carriers and riot police wearing bullet proof vests guarded key
buildings and intersections, but the march was peaceful. No clashes
were reported by the Soviet press or witnesses.
   ``The militia showed a benevolent attitude. Everything was very
orderly, and there was no violence, no arrests,'' Oleg Zhukovsky, a
spokesman for the Ukrainian nationalist group Rukh, said in a
telephone interview after the rally.
   A coalition between Rukh and Ukrainian pro-democracy groups
organized the demonstration to press a series of demands connected
with autonomy from Moscow. The coalition also called a one-day
warning strike for Monday.
   Among the demands are that Ukrainian men drafted by the Soviet
army serve only in the Ukraine; that the Ukraine refuse to sign a
new union treaty between the 15 Soviet republics; and that the
Communist Party be declared a ``criminal organization'' and
stripped of influence in all Ukrainian government organizations.
   Marchers yelled ``Down with the union treaty!'' and carried
banners saying ``The Communist Party is a Criminal Clique'' and
``Long Live the Communist Party - at the Chernobyl Power Plant.''
   A contingent from the Union of Independent Ukrainian Youth
carried a symbolic coffin bearing a photo of Vladimir Lenin and the
words ``Soviet Empire.''
   Other protesters held a blue and yellow Ukrainian flag that had
been blessed and presented to them by a Ukrainian Catholic priest.
   Turnout for the rally on a cold and overcast day was far below
the 500,000 people that organizers had predicted. Grigory
Maksimenko, a Rukh member, estimated the crowd at 100,000. Oles
Fedorchuk, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Inter Party Assembly, put
it at 75,000.
   The rally began at mid-afternoon in a square outside the city's
main stadium, where Rukh said authorities had hastily ordered
construction of a farmers' market in an attempt to disrupt the
demonstration.
   After listening to speakers call for independence and condemn
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's attempts to forge a new
union treaty, the demonstrators marched along the Kreshchatik
toward Lenin Communist Youth League Square.
   Along the way, they passed two statues of Lenin, which
nationalist groups are seeking to remove.
   Nationalist groups in several other republics also are pushing
for independence. But regional officials have been reluctant to
follow Lithuania's example, perhaps fearing economic sanctions
similar to the ones that Gorbachev imposed on Lithuani  last May.
   Lithuania was forced to close factories when the Kremlin cut off
supplies of oil, natural gas and raw materials. The embargo was
lifted in exchange for the Lithuanian parliament's agreement to
suspend its March 11 declaration of independence pending
negotiations, which are scheduled to begin Tuesday.

   Flooding in dozens of northern villages
killed 14 children, stranded tens of thousands of people and
damaged crops across wide areas, news reports said Sunday.
   Nine children drowned in flooding over the past week in
Sirajganj, 65 miles northwest of Dhaka, said United News of
Bangladesh, a news agency.
   The rain-swollen Jamuna river overflowed its banks in Sirajganj
last week, displacing about 300,000 villagers. Many took refuge on
the roofs of their mud-and-straw houses.
   The Bengali-language daily Sangbad said five children drowned in
northwestern Pabna and Manikganj districts after they fell off
rooftops into floodwaters Friday and Saturday.
   The paper also said floods have affected about 100,000 people in
the Sylhet and Netrokona districts in the northeast.
   Flooding in this low-lying delta nation annually kills hundreds
of people. The region's worst recent floods killed 1,400 people in
1988.

<HEAD>Report: Rebel Leader Declares All-Out War, Cease-fire Broken</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rebel leader Prince Johnson
reportedly said peace talks had failed and declared ``all-out war''
Sunday on two armies already battling each other with mortars and
gunfire.
   The five-nation West African force sent to end the war,
meanwhile, reportedly sent warplanes on two bombing raids against
positions of guerrilla chief Charles Taylor, a rival of Johnson.
   The West African force is the most powerful in Monrovia.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. said Johnson told journalists in
Monrovia that negotiations had failed to end the 9-month-old
conflict and ``violence is the only solution.''
   The report said Johnson accused Taylor of breaking a cease-fire,
and blamed the West African force for failing to enforce the truce.
   Johnson said he planned attacks on Taylor's forces and the
presidential mansion where remanants of slain President Samuel
Doe's forces were holed up, the BBC said.
   His announcement came after Doe's troops reportedly lobbed
mortars into Johnson's territory. On Saturday, Johnson said he was
going to attack and capture government troops, court-martial them
for war crimes, and execute those found guilty.
   It was not known whether Taylor had ordered his men to break the
cease-fire. Johnson on Saturday accused Taylor of violating the
truce with two attacks on his forces in two days.
   The French news agency Agence France-Press reported that
Taylor's rebels and Doe troops exchanged mortar fire and submachine
gunfire within 500 yards of the heavily fortified executive
mansion.
   It quoted some of Taylor's rebels as accusing Doe's soldiers of
opening hostilities, but said others among them affirmed they had
orders to fight to take the capital ``at all costs.'' Agence-France
Presse has a correspondent traveling with the rebels.
   Taylor refuses to allow reporters with his fighters to cross the
lines to other armies in Monrovia. Reporters based in areas
controlled by Johnson, who holds most of downtown Monrovia, have
been unable to cross to the rival rebel lines.
   Taylor announced a unilateral cease-fire on Sept. 22, but warned
he would fight efforts to form any government except one led by
him.
   The other three armies in Monrovia accepted the truce. But they
have refused to accept Taylor as president.
   Taylor claims the presidency as a spoil of war because his army
has overrun most of Liberia. He has said his government would be a
temporary one that would organize fair elections.
   Johnson and Doe officers back West African plans to install an
interim government which excludes the warring parties to help
ensure fair balloting. Taylor has rejected a government named by
Liberian opposition parties, businessmen and clergymen on Aug. 30,
charging it is a puppet of the West Africans. Its leaders are
waiting in neighboring Sierra Leone for fighting to die down.
   More than 5,000 civilians have been slaughtered by the three
Liberian armies since Taylor invaded from Ivory Coast on Dec. 24 to
oust Doe. Most victims lost their lives because of tribal
affiliations.

<HEAD>Papal Mass Opens Monthlong Synod on Formation of Priests</HEAD>
<HEAD>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Sunday opened a
worldwide synod of bishops to discuss revitalizing the priesthood
in the face of ``burnout,'' challenges to celibacy and a shrinking
number of interested candidates.
   The pontiff inaugurated the monthlong assembly by celebrating a
solemn Mass in St. Peter's Basilica for some 1,000 priests, bishops
and cardinals from around the world.
   The synod, an advisory body that meets to discuss major issues
in the Roman Catholic Church, was called by John Paul to discuss
the formation of priests.
   ``Let me express the hope that your labors here will produce the
abundant fruit which the ecclesiastical community is expecting,''
the pope, clad in gold robes and miter, said in his homily.
   He noted that bishops from China, Vietnam and Laos were missing
from the gathering, and said he hoped they would join the synod
later.
   No reason was given for the absence of bishops Jean Khamse of
Laos and Cambodia, Paul Nguyen Van Hoa and Emmanuel Le Phong Thuan
of Vietnam, and Lucas Liu Hsien-Tang of China. The Vatican says the
church faces serious restrictions in those Communist countries.
   At the last synod in 1987, dealing with the laity, Vietnamese
prelates arrived midway through the assembly.
   The synod is expected to focus on the difficulty in maintaining
the church's rules that priests be celibate and foresake marriage
``in a world characterized by eroticism,'' as a working document
put it.
   The rules themselves are not expected to be subjects for debate,
however, as the pope has shown no indication they might be changed.
   Several sexual scandals have embarrased the church in recent
months.
   The archbishop of Atlanta, Eugene A. Marino, resigned in July
following revelations of a two-year ``intimate relationship'' with
a young woman. In Newfoundland, Canada, a report in July by a
church-appointed commission said priests had sexually abused boys
in the province for more than a decade.
   ``Some priests question this requirement (celibacy) and some
candidates leave formation for this reason,'' the working document
said.
   It noted that in public opinion, celibacy is ``often
incomprehensible and ridiculed.'' A priest who accepts celibacy
``is sometimes looked upon in a strange way,'' it said.
   ``In this situation a priest can become totally isolated and
misunderstood to the point of becoming deeply demoralized,'' it
said. ``In some cases, the crisis in the priestly identity can
explain why priests leave the ministry.''
   The Vatican cited ``the phenomenon of burnout, from which
priests of all ages seem to suffer. They live in situations marked
by tiredness, resignation, lack of creativity.''
   The document lamented the shortage of priests and declining
number of candidates in some countries.
   ``The shortage of priests carries the further consequence that
those older priests who are still active might become overburdened,
thus making them subject to stress and to approach their work ...
simply as functionaries,'' it said.
   According to the latest statistics, there are 400,000 priests in
the world, down from 406,000 five years ago. In the United States,
students in the last four years of seminary numbered 3,698 this
year, compared with 7,855 in 1968.
   The 200 bishops at the synod included Cardinal Joseph Bernardin
of Chicago, Cardinal James Hickey of Washington, D.C., Archbishop
Daniel Pilarczyk of Cincinnati and Bishop John Marshall of
Burlington, Vermont.

   An Indian vessel docked at
the southern Persian Gulf port of Dubai on Sunday with 705 weary
evacuees from Iraq aboard. It was the second time in three weeks
that Baghdad had allowed such a sealift.
   Another Indian ship, the Akbar, with more than 1,800 people
aboard, was en route to Dubai from Iraq.
   Both ships were searched during their journeys for materials
prohibited under the U.N. embargo against Iraq, U.S. Navy officials
said.
   At the other end of the Persian Gulf, a third Indian ship
unloaded food and medicine at the Iraqi port of Umm al-Qasr. The
U.N. sanctions committee allowed the 12,972-ton Vishwa Siddhi to
deliver the supplies under a provision permitting humanitarian
shipments.
   In Dubai, children arriving aboard the Tipu Sultan clutched
teddy bears. Some refugees greeted relatives whom they had been
unable to contact since the Iraqi invasion.
   About 100,000 of the 185,000 Indians in Kuwait and Iraq were
believed to remain stranded.
   ``It's terrible,'' said one Indian, who identified himself only
as Rocky, of his journey. ``We hardly drank good water aboard the
ship.''
   His wife, Gracie, seven months pregnant, shrugged off the
discomfort. ``It's nothing compared to the relief we feel coming
here to Dubai,'' she said.
   The first of four Air India jets carrying the ship's refugees to
Bombay took off Sunday afternoon, with the others to leave later.
   Air India said Sunday it would cancel some other regularly
scheduled flights during the next two weeks to concentrate on
airlifting those fleeing Kuwait.
   Many refugees expressed both joy and sadness at leaving Kuwait,
where some had held well-paid jobs. Now, some face an uncertain
future back home, and they left most of their belongings behind.
   They spoke of sharp hikes in food prices in Kuwait. One mother
of two said the price of bread has doubled and is becoming scarce.
   Unlike the Indian refugees who arrived on another vessel last
month, many of whom were exhausted to the point of collapse, the
latest evacuees seemed healthy despite the heat and shortage of
good water.
   The Indian vessel Al-Safeer brought out 725 people earlier this
month. But the attempt to continue the sealift was held up when
Baghdad insisted the vessels bring in food and medicine despite the
sanctions.
   A U.S. Navy official in the Persian Gulf confirmed the boarding
of the Akbar and said the Tipu Sultan also had bee searched en
route. The official, who asked that his name not be used, said
boarding teams found papers in order and no prohibited material
aboard.

<HEAD>Senior Governing Party Official Quits Protesting Caste Policy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A founder of the governing party quit
Parliament on Sunday to protest Prime Minister V.P. Singh's plan to
reserve nearly half of government jobs for low-caste Hindus.
   The plan has ignited weeks of riots in which at least 50 people
have been killed in clashes with police.
   In addition, nearly a score of upper-caste students have
committed suicide, leaving notes blaming Singh.
   Devi Lal, a founder of the governing Janata Dal party, said he
was resigning to protest ``the style, timing and manner'' in which
the prime minister had adopted the job quota plan.
   He released a letter accusing Singh of ``undue haste'' and
failing to consult his Cabinet or the parties supporting the
10-month-old minority coalition.
   ``I cannot support the government which is so insensitive to the
cries of dying children and is leading the country to ...
fragmentation,'' said the letter. It accused Singh of ``preparing
the ground for civil war.''
   Devi Lal handed his letter to Singh at a meeting of
parliamentarians from the minority National Front coalition. After
he left, the meeting gave the prime minister a vote of confidence.
Four of Devi Lal's supporters objected to the procedure and walked
out.
   Devi Lal's seat remains vacant until a special election is held.
Before Sunday, the Janata Dal controlled 136 seats in the 529-seat
lower house of parliament and its coalition partners have three
seats.
   Enmity between Singh and Devi Lal has mounted for months, but
Singh's party now appears more openly split than before.
   Singh fired Devi Lal from his position as deputy prime minister
Aug. 1 after weeks of political infighting.
   Six days later Singh suddenly announced the job policy, in what
analysts read as an attempt to upstage the populist Devi Lal just
before he held a massive rally to demonstrate his support among the
rural poor and underprivileged classes.
   On Saturday, about 20 of Devi Lal's supporters in the Janata Dal
prepared a memorandum condemning Singh's leadership and suggesting
that he resign. But Devi Lal's resignation Sunday came as a
surprise.
   Also Sunday, news agencies reported six more students died from
self-inflicted injuries, raising to 19 the number of suicides in
the past 11 days.
   The policy reserves 27 percent of civil service positions for
people from backward castes, as defined in a 10-year-old government
report. Another 22.5 percent already had been set aside for the
lowest level of society, the outcastes and the tribespeople.
   Hindus, who comprise 82 percent of India's 880 million people,
are divided into four main castes and thousands of sub-castes which
set social standing according to birth. Caste often determines
profession, education opportunities and income levels.
   The government says it promoted the plan to counteract
discrimination and win social justice for the historically deprived
castes. Upper-caste students say they will suffer reverse
discrimination and lose jobs for which they are better qualified.
   The government employs about 18 million people. Official figures
say more than 13 million Indians are unemployed. About 5 million of
them are classified as educated.

<TEXT>
   Ousted Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
went before a special tribunal Sunday and professed her innocence
on corruption charges brought by the army-backed caretaker
government to try to ban her from politics.
   Ms. Bhutto was ordered to stand trial before the special
one-judge court on charges of misconduct and abuse of power during
her 20 months in office.
   Thousands of slogan-chanting well-wishers waited outside the
Sindh High Court building for Ms. Bhutto, who was dressed in a
bright-pink tunic and trousers and clutched a prayer written by a
supporter.
   The 37-year-old former prime minister said she did not recognize
the jurisdiction of the tribunals. The courts were originally
established following a 1977 military coup and resurrected last
month by the caretaker government.
   ``I have come here to show the people the hollowness and
maliciousness of the whole process,'' Ms. Bhutto said before
entering the courtroom.
   ``I have come here because I want to make a point - that the
former prime minister and the leader of Pakistan's biggest
political party is being dragged from court to court,'' she said.
``This is aimed at keeping us from fighting the election.''
   About 1,000 people jammed the benches, aisles and window sills
to watch the proceeding.
   Ms. Bhutto sat quietly during the hearing, listening to her
lawyers and occasionally scribbling notes.
   The former prime minister has been ordered to stand trial on
similar charges this week before a special tribunal in the eastern
city of Lahore, the capital of Punjab Province and a stronghold of
her political opponents.
   She could be disqualified from the Oct. 24 parliamentary
elections and banned from politics for seven years if convicted on
any charge.
   Justice Wajihuddin Ahmed promised the proceedings would not
hamper the campaign. He adjourned the trial until Oct. 10.
   The charges allege Ms. Bhutto illegally used an Asia Development
Bank loan to hire a foreign consulting firm to oversee a Karachi
power project and allowed a British-based firm to export cotton at
rates far below the international market rate.
   The former prime minister has denied any wrongdoing and accused
the president and the caretaker government of launching a witch
hunt against her, her government and her left-leaning Pakistan
People's Party.
   Ms. Bhutto spent nearly six years in prison, under house arrest
or in exile after her father, the late Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali
Bhutto, was overthrown by the military in 1977 and hanged two years
later.
   She was elected to Parliament in November 1988, in the first
free elections in more than a decade, and became the first woman to
lead a modern Moslem nation.
   President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, using his constitutional power,
dismissed Ms. Bhutto's government on Aug. 6 and installed a
caretaker government made up largely of her opponents.
   Ishaq Khan accused Ms. Bhutto's government of corruption,
incompetence and abuse of power.
   The caretaker government says it has substantial documentary
evidence to back up the charges.
   But many Pakistanis believe the charges have generated a wave of
sympathy for Ms. Bhutto. Most analysts say Ms. Bhutto and her party
appear to be gaining strength and could emerge from next month's
election as the single largest party.
   ``I cannot be disqualified because I have not done anything,''
Ms. Bhutto said. ``I am confident that we will be vindicated and
with the support of the people will emerge victorious.''

   The main contingent of the French
troops joining the U.S.-led multinational force in Saudi Arabia,
many of them desert-hardened Foreign Legionnaires, disembarked
Sunday at this Red Sea port.
   About 2,000 men and some 50 vehicles arrived on three ferries.
On Monday, two ships carrying fewer than 1,000 men and about 50
AMX-10 armored reconnaissance vehicles with 105mm guns are expected
in Yanbu.
   Their arrival will complete the sealift of France's 4,000-member
Rapid Action Force, which will be based in the northeastern desert
south of Kuwait. About 1,000 troops arrived Saturday.
   The arrival of the French force came as more Egyptian troops
were expected to reinforce the 11,000 men already based in the
desert with an Arab-Islamic force of Saudis, Kuwaitis, Syrians,
Moroccans, Pakistanis and Bagladeshis.
   Britain's 7th Armored Brigade, successors of the famed ``Desert
Rats'' of World War II, was embarking from ports in West Germany
and Britain to join the swelling multinational force confronting
the Iraqis.
   France has 14 warships in the region and is sending three
squadrons of combat jets, for a total commitment of 13,000 men in
the largest deployment of French forces overseas since Algeria's
war of independence 30 years ago.
   Convoys pulled out of the sprawling industrial port for the
three-day trip across the desert to Hafr al-Batin, the headquarters
of the Arab force that forms a defensive screen north of the U.S.
forces.
   Most of the legionnaires have had experience in desert warfare
in Chad, where they fought Libyan-backed rebel forces, as well as
Djibouti and Ghana, so they should acclimatize quickly to the Saudi
climate, Derville said.
   Derville said the legionnaires include about 30 junior officers
and men of Arab origin who had been given the option not to take
part in the campaign. But all volunteered.
   The troops' main concern was chemical weapons. They said
nuclear, biological and chemical training was now being emphasized
but their previous experience was insufficient.
   ``You'd put on a mask for two hours and go into a gas chamber
and then come out,'' said Cpl. Robin Skillington, 39, a legionnaire
from Chatham, Ky. The French Foreign Legion is made up of men from
more than 90 countries.
   The legionnaires will be facing French weapons, including 155mm
artillery and fighter jets, sold to Iraq during the 1980-88
Iran-Iraq war. France was Baghdad's main arms supplier after the
Soviet Union.

   Thousands of militant Serbs seized
weapons from a police station in ongoing struggles over autonomy
for the Serbian minority in the Croatian republic, according to
authorities and news reports Sunday.
   Police sealed off the town hall in Dvor after about 1,000 Serbs
seized arms and ammunition from the police Friday night. The
clashes there and in two other towns left one policeman seriously
injured.
   At least 27 people were arrested, the reports said.
   Meanwhile, the armed forces threatened unspecified ``urgent
steps'' against the independence-minded republic of Slovenia, whose
parliament moved Friday to strip the federal government of control
over the republic's defenses.
   President Borisav Jovic, a Serb who holds the annually rotating
chairmanship of Yugoslavia's collective presidency, announced he
would cut short his visit to the United Nations in New York
``because of the deterioration of the political and security
situation'' at home, the state news agency Tanjug said.
   The announcement referred indirectly to Slovenia's actions
Friday. The Defense Ministry appealed Saturday to the president to
take action to keep federal forces intact.
   Yugoslavians are at odds over the future of the country's
fragile, six-republic federation. The republics are fractured along
religious, ethnic, economic and political lines.
   Croatia and Slovenia want the country to be changed into a
looser confederation of sovereign states.
   Serbia seeks to maintain tighter central control, and even to
change its border with Croatia to incorporate Serbs living there.
   The rivalry between Serbs and Croats has escalated sharply since
a center-right government ousted the Communists in free elections
in Croatia last spring.
   Serbs make up about 10 percent of the population of the Croatian
republic, but are the majority in some towns. Croatia's authorities
last month rejected calls for greater autonomy for some Serbian
strongholds.
   Several hundred Serb women and children, said by Tanjug to fear
special Croatian police units, spent Saturday night huddled in army
barracks in Petrinja, about 25 miles south of Croatia's capital,
Zagreb.
   In Dvor, 25 miles south of Petrinja, special police patrolled
th8e town and schools were ordered closed until the police units
leave town.
   Tanjug reported from Zagreb that some roads in the area around
Knin, another Croatian town dominated by Serbs, had been blocked
off by Serbian militants. Some of the militants were threatening to
cut off roads to the coast unless people arrested over the weekend
were freed.

<HEAD>Superpowers Begin Drafting Resolutions To Authorize Force Against
Iraq</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and the Soviet Union have
begun drafting resolutions to authorize the use of military force
against Iraq if a worldwide economic squeeze does not force a
retreat from Kuwait, U.S. officials said Sunday.
   Both superpowers would move against Iraq under U.N. auspices,
but the Soviets prefer to work under a joint military command while
the United States prefers more ``logistical'' leeway, the officials
told The Associated Press.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who has repeatedly
cautioned Iraq that the military option might be taken, consulted
last week with more than a dozen foreign ministers attending the
U.N. General Assembly session.
   They included the British, French, West German, Japanese,
Canadian and Italian ministers, who met with Baker over dinner
Wednesday night. Iraq's occupation of Kuwait, which is resisting a
freeze on trade ordered Aug. 6 by the U.N. Security Council, was
the main topic.
   ``A lot of ideas are kicking around,'' a U.S. official said.
``Everybody is asking what we will do next.''
   The official said the drafting at this point was tentative -
``back of the envelope stuff,'' is the way he described it.
``Everybody is looking at options,'' he said.
   The officials said other delegations also have begun drafting
proposed resolutions, all with the view of being ready to act
against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to restore Kuwait's national
legitimacy.
   There was no indication when the Council would be asked to take
up a call for action.
   Besides the economic boycott, the Council has approved a
military blockade and, last Tuesday, an embargo on air traffic.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
Bush administration was inclined to act under Article 42 of the
U.N. Charter instead of Article 51, which affirms the right of
self-defense.
   Article 42 authorizes ``action by air, sea or land forces as ...
necessary to retain or restore international peace or security.''
   The Soviet Union, which is cooperating with the Bush
administration against Iraq, is taking a harder line toward Saddam
in plotting military action, the officials said.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze signaled a tough stance
Sunday saying ``we are a permanent member of the security Council
and we will comply with any decision, with any resolution of the
security council.''
   Shevardnadze, interviewed on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press,'' added:
``That would include anything regarding the involvement of the
Soviet troops under the flag, under the auspices, of the United
Nations.''
   In principle, Shevardnadze said, he would like to see the use of
force ruled out. But, he said, ``If extreme conditions develop,
then any decision must be taken within the framework of the
security council.''
   Shevardnadze stressed that the U.N. military staff committee
must be involved if force is used against Iraq.
   Within the Bush administration, meanwhile, senior officials are
intensifying the threat of force if economic sanctions do not
compel Iraq to withdraw from the oil-rich emirate.
   On Friday, Brent Scowcroft, the president's assistant for
national security, said the ``systematic destruction'' of Kuwait
under Iraqi occupation is shortening the time that the United
States can wait for sanctions to drive out the Iraqi army.
   President Bush will have a chance on Monday to coordinate
strategy with Moscow during an afternoon meeting with Shevardnadze.
Baker will then see the Soviet foreign minister on Wednesday, their
third meeting in less than a week.

<HEAD>First Public Inquiry Into Pan Am Crash To Check for Security
Lapses</HEAD>

   Families of victims in the crash of
Pan Am Flight 103 say they hope a public inquiry opening Monday,
the first in the case, will help determine how the bombing might
have been prevented.
   The inquiry is expected to look at airport security lapses, but
it won't seek to assess criminal responsibility for the crash.
   Families of some of the 270 victims want the investigation to
cover security not just at London's Heathrow Airport but also at
Frankfurt, West Germany, where the flight originated.
   The Boeing 747 was bound for New York when it blew apart over
the small Scottish town of Lockerbie on Dec. 21, 1988. Eleven of
the victims were people on the ground.
   Investigators say there is not enough evidence to prosecute
anyone for the attack, but they have pursued clues pointing to
radical Palestinians.
   The public inquiry, run by a Scottish judge, will be held in
Dumfries, 12 miles from Lockerbie. The proceedings, expected to
last three months, are being held in a hall converted into a
courtroom.
   The inquiry will take evidence on the plane's airworthiness, air
traffic control, the emergency response, the deaths, the
destruction of the aircraft, and security arrangements, the
Scottish office said.
   In a key ruling at a preliminary hearing Sept. 20, the judge
rejected efforts by the British government and Pan Am to restrict
evidence to Britain. The judge, Sheriff Principal John S. Mowat,
ruled that evidence from Pan Am baggage handlers at Frankfurt
Airport would be admissible if it he thought it relevant.
   After the preliminary hearing, Jim Swire, who heads a relatives'
group called U.K. Families-Flight 103, said he was ``much more
optimistic'' about getting a fair hearing on how the bombing could
have been prevented.
   ``We have not wavered from our determination to see British
security examined in at least the same detail as U.S. security has
been, and we can't imagine why they've waited 21 months even to
start,'' said Swire. His 24-year-old daughter, Flora, was killed in
the bombing.
   A U.S. presidential commission, which spent nine months
investigating the crash, reported in May that ``the destruction of
Flight 103 may well have been preventable.''
   The commission cited lapses in security, including failure to
physically search luggage transferred from other airlines. It said
no effort was made to ensure that all bags were accompanied by
passengers.
   Its report called for notification of passengers when there is a
credible bomb threat and said the United States should consider
military strikes or covert operations against air terrorists.
   Swire said the families have much greater confidence in the
Scottish judiciary, which is separate from the English judiciary.
   ``We feel sure it will treat us fairly, and we intend to give it
an opportunity to do so,'' Swire said in an interview Friday.
   The British government has rejected the families' request for an
independent investigation, saying all necessary ground would be
covered by the continuing police investigation and the public
hearing.
   Scottish investigators have said they are investigating Ahmed
Jibril's radical Palestinian group, the Popular Front for the
Liberation Of Palestine-General Command, and Mohammad Abu Talb, a
member of another radical Palestinian group jailed in Sweden for
bombings in northern Europe.
   Other unidentified individuals and groups are also under
investigation.
   Police say the bomb was hidden inside a radio-cassette recorder
in a suitcase that was probably put aboard the flight in Frankfurt.
Baggage was transferred from a Boeing 727 to a larger Boeing 747
when the flight stopped at Heathrow.

   The Palestinian death toll in the uprising
against Israeli occupation climbed above 1,000 Sunday with rioting
in a West Bank village and recriminations against Arabs suspected
of collaborating with Israel.
   Police gunfire in the village of Jamain killed one Palestinian
and wounded 21 others, four seriously, the army command said.
Israel radio described the riot there as ``severe.''
   Three Palestinians were slain Sunday on suspicion of
collaborating with Israel, according to Palestinian reports. The
army said it was checking the reports.
   An Arab man was injured Sunday while trying to hurl a bomb at a
bus stop near the southern Israeli port city of Ashdod, police
said, and a masked man tried unsuccessfully to stab a Jew in
Jerusalem's walled Old City.
   The unrest came after roads into Israel were re-opened from the
occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The territories had been
sealed off for 24 hours for Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of
Atonement.
   The army said the violence in Jamain, a village of 3,000 just
south of Nablus, began after a jeepload of paramilitary border
police ``encountered disturbances'' and attempted to disperse the
rioters.
   Arab journalists said Palestinian students at the village's high
school hurled stones at the troops. The Israeli patrol fired some
15 tear gas cannisters into the school and, aftering calling
reinforcements, raided the building.
   Parents of the students rushed to the school, trying to stop the
troops, and clashed with them inside the compound, Arab reports
said.
   Ahmad Shehadeh, 58, was hit with two bullets in the head and the
neck and was dead on arrival at Ittihad hospital in Nablus,
hospital officials reported.
   The alleged collaborators whose deaths were reported Sunday
included Adel Abu Baher, 23, whose body was found near the Gaza
Strip refugee camp of Khan Yunis. Arab reports said he was stabbed
to death by uprising activists.
   Imad Abu Jubeh, 25, a suspected drug dealer, was stabbed to
death in the Gaza village of Beit Lahiya, Arab reporters said.
   In the Gaza town of Rafah, masked activists killed 53-year-old
Hmaidan Kashta, firing several shots at him in the school where he
worked as a guard, Arab journalists said.
   Six suspected collaborators have died in Rafah this month. Arab
reporters based in Gaza said all the victims were shot in the same
way and attributed the murders to the ``Black Panthers,'' a
mysterious group of enforcers operating in the town.
   Sunday's deaths raised to 1,003 the number of Palestinians
killed in the 34-month uprising against Israeli rule over the lands
captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
   According to tallies kept by The Associated Press, 731 Arabs
have been killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians in the rebellion,
and 272 have been slain by fellow Palestinians, most on suspicion
of collaborating with Israel.
   In the unrest, 52 Israelis and foreigners have been killed by
Arabs.
   Meanwhile, Gaza and parts of the West Bank were paralyzed by a
strike called by underground uprising leaders to express sympathy
for residents of Gaza's Bureij refugee camp.
   The camp of 20,000 has been under curfew since an Israeli
soldier was killed there Sept. 20. The army has demolished or
sealed over 40 shops and homes in Bureij since the killing.

   Inside a dusty tent, sheltered from gritty
desert winds, a dozen Indian officials toiled Sunday on a
bureaucratic assembly line to ready passports for weary refugees.
   Outside, along rows of olive green army tents painted a reddish
yellow by the desert sand, about 13,000 Indian refugees in a
transit camp waited, and waited some more.
   Even in this barren wasteland, the bureaucracy is slow and
agonizing.
   ``We were called out at 3 a.m. and told to assemble with our
belongings,'' said George Thomas, a 39-year-old Indian engineer who
left Kuwait six days ago and is waiting for his passport to be
processed.
   ``Some buses came, some people left but many were left behind.
Now our embassy tells us to go back to our tents and wait for
further instructions.
   ``Maybe it was a misunderstanding between our officials and the
Jordanian police,'' allowed Thomas. ``We find the Indian embassy
hasn't coordinated all the transfers. They are supposed to call us
by the repatriation numbers attached to each passport, but they
never follow them.''
   Inside one tent, blue-turbaned Indian diplomat G.S. Chhokra,
between assignments in Helsinki and Madrid, continued his work. He
quickly and steadily processed passports as he talked to two
reporters.
   Chhokra said that so far 81,000 Indian refugees from Iraq and
Kuwait had been repatriated from Jordan. He said he hoped 3,400 to
3,500 others would leave for home sometime Sunday.
   The Indian government believes it can complete the evacuation of
all Indians, including those remaining in Iraq and Kuwait, by Oct.
10, he said.
   ``We are working 12- to 14-hour shifts with no Saturdays or
Sundays (off),'' said Chhokra. ``I have never worked so hard.''
   But some refugees forced to bide their time and endure the
boredom of the desert camp wonder aloud if the diplomats work hard
enough.
   ``Those who have influence go first,'' complained P.
Radakrishnan, a 40-year-old construction worker who has waited four
days for a flight home to Bombay.
   ``If you don't have influence you don't go at all. They have not
gone yet,'' he said, nodding to the other men in his tent. ``They
have no influence.''
   Such sentiments led to a brief but violent episode last week
when refugees stormed a minibus that they erroneously believed was
taking the relatives of an Indian official to the airport.
   Chhokra, without looking up from his work on the passports,
dismissed the complaints as baseless.
   ``Human nature being what it is, everybody wants to go earlier
than the others,'' he said.
   The desert bureaucracy, like those elsewhere, works invisibly
and seemingly mysteriously, at least to the thousands forced to
wait in tents and food lines.
   The red tape compounds the misery of people who already have
lost everything.
   ``We got out of our tents when we heard the police calling on us
to get going,'' said one Indian caught up in the confusion over the
buses on Sunday.
   ``As soon as we left our tents the newcomers came in and started
grabbing everything,'' said the man who would identify himself only
as James.
   ``Now we must stay and some of the things they took are very
dear, such as food, blankets and kerosene stoves,'' he added, more
out of frustration than bitterness. ``There is no way we can get
those things back.''

   The Soviet Union and South Korea
established full diplomatic relations Sunday in what was seen as a
major victory for the Seoul government and a devastating setback
for Communist North Korea.
   The Soviet Union has been a major ally and arms provider for
North Korea.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and his South Korean
counterpart, Choi Ho-joong, signed an agreement establishing the
ties, issued a joint communique and stood together in a U.N.
corridor, smiling and answering questions.
   ``We have agreed to establish diplomatic relations between the
Soviet Union and South Korea as of today,'' Choi later told a news
conference.
   He said both sides had agreed to an exchange of high-level
visits, possibly by heads of state, but no date was set. He said a
Soviet trade and economic delegation will visit Seoul next month to
discuss broad economic cooperation.
   ``We believe that establishing diplomatic relations between the
Soviet Union and South Korea will aid the cause of stability in
Asia and the Pacific region,'' Shevardnadze told reporters. He
called South Korea an important factor for peace in the region.
   Shevardnadze added that improved relations with South Korea
would not adversely affect Soviet relations with any other state -
an indirect reference to North Korea.
   There was no immediate comment from North Korean diplomats at
the United Nations. The move was widely seen as a diplomatic blow
to Pyongyang, which has become increasingly isolated amid the
recent trends elsewhere toward democracy and liberalization.
   South Korea has long been pushing for ties with the Soviet
Union, and Moscow has been eager for enhanced trade and economic
cooperation to help bolster the sinking Soviet economy.
   Moscow and Seoul have signed agreements on trade, economic
investments, transfer of technology and other cooperation.
Bilateral trade was $600 million in 1989 and is expected to reach
$1 billion this year.
   The Soviet decision would leave China as North Korea's most
powerful Communist ally. But China, too, has been cautiously
improving its relations with South Korea and is interested in South
Korean investment and technology.
   Choi said he hoped the development would spur China to establish
full diplomatic ties with Seoul.
   ``We hope this move will help end relations of confrontation and
competition between the North and South,'' he said.
   Both Koreas currently hold non-voting observer status at the
United Nations.
   Sunday's move was expected to give South Korea more leverage in
its bid to join the United Nations as a full member separately from
North Korea. The north has opposed separate entry, saying it would
only reaffirm the division between the nations.
   South Korean diplomats have said they would only seek U.N.
admission if they are certain that China, a permanent member of the
Security Council with veto power, would not oppose them.

<TEXT>
   Two journalists whose deaths
were reported as traffic fatalities were apparently killed by
gunfire, a church-related human rights agency reported Sunday, and
it demanded a government investigation.
   The bodies of the two Salvadoran reporters, Pedro Martinez, 28,
and Jorge Euceda, 38, were found in their car Friday on the Pan
American Highway, 27 miles east of San Salvador.
   ``There was definitely a criminal hand in this, but many things
remain to be cleared up,'' said Maria Julia Hernandez, director of
the Roman Catholic Church's Legal Aid office.
   Police reports blamed the deaths on a traffic accident. But
Hernandez said her office had demanded an autopsy that showed
Martinez had bits of ammunition in his left eye and cuts on the
sides of his body.
   ``They shot at the journalists and some bullet fragments lodged
in the face, making him lose control of the vehicle he was
driving,'' Hernandez said.
   The blood on the pavement and the absence of it inside the
vehicle ``could mean that the journalists were dragged out of the
automobile and then beaten to death,'' she added.
   Hernandez said no there were no suspects.
   The deaths immediately aroused the suspicions of reporters, who
requested the assistance of Legal Aid. The news media and relatives
of the victims have called for a complete investigation of the
deaths.

   Hungarians voted in local elections
Sunday that mark the final stage in the nation's rapid evolution to
a multiparty democracy. It was the fifth election in less than a
year for Hungary's estimated 7.8 million registered voters, and a
degree of voter burnout was evident.
   Election officials said only 34.5 percent of the electorate
turned out in the capital. More than 40 percent voted in most towns
with less than 10,000 people.
   Earlier elections were for members of Hungary's 394-seat
Parliament and other offices.
   On Sunday, more than 27,000 seats on 3,093 local councils were
at stake. All but 163 of the councils serve communities of less
than 10,000 inhabitants. The new local governments will be
self-governing bodies with jurisdiction over local taxes.
   Electoral law stipulates at least 40 percent of the electorate
must vote in each locale for the vote to be valid. A second ballot
is scheduled for Oct. 14 in communities where the quota is not
reached.
   Official results are not expected until Monday.
   Although 42 parties and many independents were on the various
ballots, Sunday's vote was also seen as a test of popularity for
the governing Hungarian Democratic Forum and the liberal
opposition, the Alliance of Free Democrats, almost six months after
national elections.
   One closely watched contest was in Budapest, where Free
Democrats candidate Gabor Demsky, a longtime dissident under the
Communists, was challenging a City Hall official from the Forum.

<HEAD>Bush Makes Quick Dash to Washington for Budget Meeting</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 14th graf pvs, bgng: On Monday, to UPDATE with
resolutions being drafted on use of military force against Iraq</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   President Bush interrupted a diplomatic blitz on
the Persian Gulf and raced through a summit on children's problems
Sunday to dash back to the White House for the climax of talks on a
$500 billion deficit-reduction agreement.
   The hurried trip scrambled plans for Bush to meet in New York
with nine world leaders to bolster international resolve against
Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait.
   Bush completed his quick round trip to the White House and back
in less than five hours, and quickly stepped into an extended round
of diplomatic one-on-ones with visiting foreign leaders. He planned
a working dinner with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on
Sunday night.
   Bush missed five bilaterals while in Washington. He rescheduled
two Sunday evening with Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and
Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, and two more on Monday
evening with Bangladesh President Hussain Mohammad Ershad and El
Salvador President Alfredo Christiani.
   Before going to Washington, Bush briefly joined more than 70
world leaders at the United Nations for the first World Summit for
Children, focusing on problems such as malnutrition and disease
which claim the lives of 40,000 infants around the world each day.
   The president, eager to fly to Washington to announce the budget
accord, cut out large chunks of his prepared speech and spoke for
only eight minutes. He did not pledge any new money to meet the
summit's goals to improve life for poor children but recited U.S.
efforts to improve education, eradicate measles and reduce infant
mortality and low-weight births.
   ``All children must be given the chance to lead happy, healthy
and productive lives,'' Bush said. He acknowledged that the United
States, which ranks 19th among nations in preventing infant
mortality, could take lessons from some other countries.
   ``Programs can best enhance the welfare of children by
strengthening the mutual responsibilities of public institutions
and individual families,'' the president said. ``We should also
look to the private sector as an essential partner.''
   He said ``When it comes to improving the welfare of children,
empowerment should begin first with their parents.''
   In his haste, Bush omitted remarks that less bureaucracy and a
free-market system will bring prosperity, which he said is ``the
surest antidote to disease and starvation for any society.''
   Bush mentioned the Persian Gulf crisis only in passing, saying
the world had ``acted decisively in defense of a principle - that
small states shall not become souvenirs of conquest.''
   On top of meetings Sunday with the presidents of Brazil,
Venezuela and Czechoslovakia and dinner with Thatcher, Bush added
King Baudoin of Belgium. The presidents of Italy and Yugoslavia
were penciled in for Monday afternoon.
   That left Bush with 10 bilateral meetings set for Monday and 22
during his three days in New York. The only leader scratched from
Bush's schedule was NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner.
   On Monday, Bush will address the U.N. General Assembly. U.S.
officials said the United States and the Soviet Union have begun
drafting resolutions to authorize the use of military force against
Iraq if economic sanctions do not force a retreat from Kuwait.
   Brent Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser, has
suggested that Iraq's destruction of Kuwait was bringing the United
States and its allies closer to military action.
   Bush arrived in New York on Saturday with a plan to consult with
more than two-dozen leaders over three days. He talked with six
heads of state Saturday in a quick series of meetings lasting no
longer than 45 minutes each.
   Before returning to Washington on Monday, Bush will hold talks
with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.

   The mutilated and burned
bodies of four whites were found in a black township that has been
the site of several racial confrontations in recent months, police
said Sunday.
   Police said they did not know if the attack was racially
motivated and they made no arrests.
   Also Sunday, African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela
called for an urgent meeting this week with the government to
discuss the violence in the black townships around Johannesburg
that has left about 800 dead since early August. Only two of the
victims have been white.
   Police reported the deaths of three more blacks in two townships
near Johannesburg, Tembisa and Sebokeng.
   The bodies of the four whites - three men and a woman - were
found next to a burned-out car in Khutloanong, said Police Maj.
Johan Fouche. The townshipis 150 miles southwest of Johannesburg
near the towns of Odendaalsrus and Welkom.
   The four apparently had visited a bar in the township Saturday,
police said. The bodies, which were badly mutilated with knives and
then set afire, were found Saturday night, Fouche said.
   Local authorities had threatened to shut off electricity a week
ago in Khutloanong because residents were not paying their bills to
protest living conditions, an official in Odendaalsrus said.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
power remained on after angry residents burned the homes of black
town councilors in Khutloanong. But tensions remain high in the
township, the official said.
   There have been several racial incidents recently in and around
the mining town of Welkom.
   Whites in the area are considered among the most conservative in
the country and many are opposed to Presidewnt F.W. de Klerk's
reforms.
   In one incident, hundreds of black miners attacked their white
supervisers at a gold mine compound, killing one. Blacks also have
carried out random attacks on white motorists driving near black
areas.
   White right-wing groups have set up night patrols, and blacks
say they have been harassed by the vigilantes.
   De Klerk says he wants to end the apartheid system of racial
segregation and draw up a new constitution that will allow the 5
million whites and 30 million blacks to share power.
   De Klerk was to meet Oct. 14 with Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher in Britain, government sources in London said.

   Most New Yorkers took the historic U.N. summit
in stride, along with the traffic delays caused by dozens of
limousines clogging the city. Some tourists, however, resented the
intrusion on their vacations.
   ``Why did this have to happen on my vacation?'' said Linda Katz
of Pittsburgh as a police officer turned her away from a street
leading to the United Nations complex. ``I had no idea this was
going on.''
   Most motorists pulled aside to make way for dignitaries - some
accompanied by police escorts - traveling to the United Nations in
midtown Manhattan. Limousines were double- and even triple-parked
on some streets.
   Bicyclists and pedestrians navigated past the police lines set
up around the United Nations and waited for a glimpse of a visiting
leader arriving at the front entrance.
   Protesters were also on hand Sunday, as they had been all
weekend.
   More than 400 demonstrators, carrying small black coffins
bearing the names of slain children, on Sunday protested El
Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani's participation at the World
Summit for Children.
   The New York Committee in Solidarity with the People of El
Salvador rallied in front of the El Salvadoran U.N. mission at noon
before leading a mock funeral procession down Park Avenue near the
United Nations.
   ``We don't think Cristiani has any right to speak,'' said
Michele Ascione, 27, one of the committee organizers. ``He's
responsible for thousands of atrocities against children in El
Salvador.''
   There were no arrests at the protest, police said.
   A smaller group protested against Bangladesh President Hussain
Mohammad Ershad.
   Police said fewer people that expected gathered near the United
Nations.
   ``There doesn't seem to be as much interest as we thought in the
summit,'' said Officer Scott Bloch.
   But Darwin Deleon, 12, who sat on a corner a few blocks from the
United Nations, knew all about the summit and applauded it.
   ``I think it's good they all came here to talk about kids
because maybe they'll get something done,'' said Deleon, whose Boy
Scout troop helped distribute welcome boxes at the United Nations
prior to the summit. ``They ought to do something about the Third
World. I saw pictures of children with their bones sticking out.''
   Karen Krenzin, who brought her mother, husband and 18-month-old
daughter, Jesse, on an afternoon stroll to the United Nations, said
the summit would likely only be symbolic.
   ``It's good that they're meeting but it does seem as if they'll
just decide to give more American tax dollars to other countries,''
said Krenzin. ``The problem with other countries is that they have
too many children.''
   More than 70 kings, presidents and prime ministers forged a
multi-billion dollar strategy at the U.N. summit to help children,
described by participants as the world's most precious resource.
   President Bush addressed the world leaders Sunday morning,
urging nations around the world to ``live up to our
responsibilities'' to save children.

<HEAD>Block Party Turns Into Riot: 17 Injured, 89 Arrested</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Police used tear gas to break up a block
party that turned into a riot when revelers attacked authorities
trying to put out a bonfire. Seventeen people were injured and 89
arrested, officials said.
   Up to 2,000 people were at the annual bash across the street
from the University of Akron when fire and police officials
responded to a call at midnight Friday to put out a large bonfire.
   Some of the revelers - mostly college-aged youths - tried to
block their entrance and then threw bottles, rocks and glass at
emergency personnel trying to douse the fire, officials said.
   Officer Brian Reilly said when police asked the crowd to
disperse, ``They kept the fire going and continued chanting, `Hell
no, we won't go.'''
   Police used tear gas and firefighters turned their hoses on the
crowd to break up the melee.
   ``We were being pelted with bottles and rocks from all sides.
People were throwing things from the porches and second-story
windows of the houses. It was a bad situation and we had to end
it,'' Lt. Tom Hanley said.
   Some students charged police used excessive force to break up
the disturbance. Police Chief Philip G. Barnes denied the charge.
   Most of those injured received cuts and bruises. There were no
serious injuries, police said.
   Eighty-nine people were arrested on misdemeanor charges
including intoxication and failure to disperse, police said.
   City officials planned to meet Monday to sort out the incident.
   ``This is a difficult one,'' Mayor Don Plusquellic said. ``It's
becoming more difficult as we get further into it. The judges tell
me most were not Akron University students.
   City service crews cleared Kathryn Place, the site of the melee,
on Saturday under police protection. Campus and city police ran
beefed-up patrols Saturday night.
   University officials said the party was not a school-sanctioned
event.
   ``There isn't a mechanism for controlling that (parties) on the
part of the university since that is off campus,'' said Kathy
Stafford, vice president for institutional advancement.
   About 5,000 students live in the neighborhoods south and east of
the University of Akron. The student housing along Kathryn Place is
considered the worst of the off-campus housing, said Roger Ryan,
vice president of administrative services.

   An inch of rain helped quell a fire that has
consumed more than 11,000 acres of the Okefenokee Swamp, but it was
not nearly enough to douse the blaze, officials said Sunday.
   ``That one inch will probably hold it down for a little while,''
said Jim Burkhart, spokesman for the Okefenokee Wildlife Refuge.
``But, it's not going to be enough to keep (the fire) down.''
   The fire has burned 11,300 acres since it began with a Sept. 1
lightning strike, Burkhart said. The swamp covers more than 700,000
acres, with 396,000 acres in the refuge and 356,000 acres in a
federally designated wilderness.
   Trenches dug in an effort to contain the blaze were holding up
Sunday, Burkhart said, but a crew of 500 firefighters still must
contend with ``a big flank of fire out in the swamp itself.''
   The fire was burning primarily in the southwest part of the
Okefenokee, which currently is drier than it has been at any time
since 318,000 acres of swamp and adjacent timberland burned in
1954-55.
   Average rainfall in the Okefenokee is 53 inches per year.
Rainfall is 17.5 inches below normal so far this year and 24 inches
for the last two years. Before Saturday's rain, only .08 inch of
rain had fallen in September, officials said.
   All public use of the refuge and the Stephen Foster State Park
on its west side was cut off. The Okefenokee Swamp Park, a private
attraction on the north edge of the swamp, remained open.

<TEXT>
   After 50 years as a Roman Catholic
missionary visiting the sick, teaching religion and training altar
boys, Sister Beatrice Lorenz has found a new calling - cosmetology.
   Sister Bea finished two years of training at the Trend School of
Beauty in Riverton last month. Now she plans to cut, wash and style
hair at the Our Lady of Victory Missionary Sisters convent in
Huntington, Ind.
   At the convent, Sister Bea's clientele will include retired
nuns, the convent's administrators and visitors.
   Sister Bea said she would continue ``primarily in a life of
prayer,'' but believes her new skills fit in nicely with her life's
work.
   ``If people look good they feel good,'' she said.
   Sister Bea, born in Minneapolis, entered the Indiana mission in
1940 and served in Michigan, Utah, New Mexico, Missouri, Colorado
and California before moving to Wyomin in the 1960s.
   Two years ago, she enrolled in beauty school in Riverton in
central Wyoming and earned her cosmetology license last month.
   ``I wanted the challenge,'' the nun said. ``I feel the future
belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.''

   Saddam Hussein struck a softer note Sunday in the Persian Gulf
crisis, urging peaceful dialogue instead of ``threats and
warnings.'' U.S. and Soviet officials were reported drafting U.N.
resolutions to authorize the use of military force against Iraq if
an economic squeeze fails to force Iraq out of Kuwait.
   Saddam said Sunday he no longer opposed foreign-power
involvement in seeking a settlement to the crisis, touched off by
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   His message, broadcast on Iraqi TV and radio, came as world
leaders meeting at the United Nations moved to shore up diplomatic
efforts against his country.
   U.S. officials told The Associated Press the superpowers would
move against Iraq under U.N. auspices if other measures failed, but
Moscow wanted a joint military command while Washington preferred
more ``logistical'' leeway.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said Sunday that
Soviet forces would participate in any action against Iraq
authorized by the United Nations.
   One of the U.S. officials emphasized that the talks with the
Soviets were tentative - ``Everybody is looking at options.'' The
officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
   President Bush will address the General Assembly on Monday.
Brent Scowcroft, his national security adviser, said Friday that
America is considering asking U.N. authorization for military
action.

<TEXT>
   The Security Council has already approved an economic boycott, a
military blockade and an air embargo.
   Saudi King Fahd urged Saddam to seek a peaceful solution,
saying: ``It should not be hard or difficult for President Saddam
to overcome the hurdles just as he knocked down those that existed
with Iran, the Moslem state.''
   Shortly after invading Kuwait, Saddam abandoned territorial
claims against Iran that had been a major stumbling block to
reaching an Iran-Iraq peace. The neighbors fought a bloody war from
1980-88 before a U.N.-brokered cease-fire halted the fighting.
   When Iraq massed troops on Saudi borders after invading Kuwait,
Fahd asked military forces from the United States and other
Western, Islamic and Arab states to defend his country, the world's
No. 1 exporter of oil.
   ``Saudi Arabia does not hesitate to knock on the door of
peace,'' Fahd said Saturday. ``It is the best door on which to
knock at these times.''
   His remarks were distributed Sunday by the official Saudi Press
Agency.
   Thousands of French troops joined the U.S.-led multinational
force in the gulf on Sunday, and U.S. and British warships stopped
and searched a ship carrying refugees from the region.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir warned in a speech Sunday
in Jerusalem that any Arab ruler who attacks Israel would ``swiftly
discover he has made a terrible mistake.'' Iraq has threatened
Israel.
   Military chief Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron said on Israel TV Saturday
night that Israel sought to coordinate its moves with America in
the crisis, but may have to act independently if Iraq put Israeli
citizens in danger.
   But Saudi Defense Minister Prince Sultan bin Abdel-Aziz said
Israel must keep out of gulf crisis, no matter how serious the
conflict may become.
   ``We will not allow Israel . . . to defend us against Iraq or
against anybody else,'' he told reporters Sunday.
   Saddam's speech, read by an announcer, said tensions can be
reduced in the gulf ``if dialogue replaces the policy of threats
and warnings, if the language of peaceful politics replaces the
policy of troop buildups and threats of the use of force.''
   He said foreign countries could help in solving the crisis. But
he again linked any solution to Israel's withdrawal from the
occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank, and the pullout of Syrian forces
from Lebanon.
   Saddam said he wanted to open a dialogue with France to explore
the possibility of using President Francois Mitterrand's ideas as
basis for a settlement.
   In a U.N. speech Sept. 24, Mitterrand suggested settling the
conflict over Kuwait together with other regional problems that
might include the Israeli occupation of Arab territories and the
Lebanese civil war.
   In the gulf Sunday, U.S. and British warships stopped and
searched an Indian ship ferrying hundreds of refugees fleeing
Kuwait. Another vessel docked at the United Arab Emirates with 705
evacuees aboard, and a U.S. Navy official n the gulf said it also
had been searched.
   The official said boarding teams found no cargo prohibited under
the U.N. trade embargo.
   At the northern end of the gulf, a cargo vessel unloaded food
and medicine at Umm al-Qasr, Iraq. The U.N. sanctions committee
allowed the shipment under a provision permitting humanitarian
supplies.
   Also Sunday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement dismissed as
``totally groundless'' a report by the British newspaper
Independent that China agreed to sell Iraq a chemical used to make
nuclear weapons, missile fuel and nerve gas.
   Another Chinese statement expressed concern about a Japanese
proposal to send military personnel to the gulf, in what would be
the first deployment of Japanese troops overseas since World War
II.
   China retains bitter memories of Japan's invasion in the 1930s.
It did not elaborate on what assurances it would like from Japan.
The Japanese plan envisons an unarmed Japanese force operating
under U.N. command.
   In Yanbu, Saudi Arabia, about 2,000 French soldiers, most of
them Foreign Legionnaires, and 50 vehicles came off three ferries
and joined convoys to the northeastern part of the country.
   Among those arriving was American Martin Meyer, a former U.S.
Air Force serviceman who joined the Foreign Legion nearly five
years ago.
   ``We are very ... expendable,'' said Meyer, 28, a former
resident of Mexico, Mo. ``We are the front line forces.''
   The French soldiers are part of an estimated 200,000-member
multinational force, dominated by about 165,000 Americans. The
Pentagon estimated last week that about 430,000 Iraqi troops were
in Kuwait and southern Iraq.
   Meanwhile, Jordan threatened to restrict the flow of foreigners
fleeing Iraq into Jordan unless it got more international aid. More
than 600,000 people poured in after the invasion, officials said.
   Interior Ministry undersecretary Salameh Hammad told a news
conference Jordan had received only $1.7 million of $100 million
promised by world institutions.
   ``I'm afraid I will have to ask the government to adopt
appropriate measures to ensure that the number of arrivals does not
exceed the number of departures,'' Hammad said.
   Also on Sunday:
   -Kuwait's government-in-exile said at its temporary base in
Taif, Saudi Arabia, that Iraq's decision to cancel the Kuwaiti
dinar was ``null and void'' and that the dinar was ``still the
official currency of the state of Kuwait.'' The dinar was worth
$3.50 before the invasion.
   -Palestinian guerrilla leader Nayef Hawatmeh returned to Jordan
from talks in Iraq saying war is inevitable as long as Washington
refuses to link the Persian Gulf and Palestinian issues. Hawatmeh,
secretary-general of the Marxist Democratic Front for Liberation of
Palestine, met Saddam in Baghdad.

   Two U.S. Air Force pilots were
killed Sunday when their F-15 fighter plane crashed during an
exercise in Saudi Arabia, the U.S. military command said.
   They were the first Air Force personnel reported killed in Saudi
Arabia since the beginning of Operation Desert Shield nearly two
months ago. An F-16 crashed earlier but the pilot was not hurt.
   The aircraft, assigned to the 4th Tactical Fighter Wing, was on
what was described as a routine mission in the southern Saudi
desert on Sunday morning, officers said.
   The pilots' names were withheld pending notification of
relatives. A board of inquiry was assigned to investigate.
   The crash brought to five the number of U.S. servicemen killed
in Saudi Arabia during operation Desert Shield.
   Five crewmen were injured in the crash of an Army UH-60
Blackhawk helicopter on Saturday. Officers said one remained in
critical condition, three in good condition and one was released.
   Two soldiers have been killed and one hurt in vehicle accidents,
and a sailor was accidentally electrocuted on a ship. A Saudi man
was killed in a collision of a taxi and a Marine Force pickup
truck.

   The United States has nearly four times the

   Researchers from the National Institutes of Health and the Food
and Drug Administration reported in Monday's Annals of Internal
Medicine that the excessive equipment and high cost of the test may
hinder increased use of mammography machines, which detect breast
cancer.
   ``Despite an increasing trend in usage that we project, we found
that the supply of dedicated mammography machines is outrunning the
need,'' said lead author Martin L. Brown of the National Cancer
Institute.
   An editorial accompanying the report warned that the abundant
supply may not improve health care.
   ``The oversupply of mammography units may ultimately lead to a
situation in which more care does not mean better care, and it
certainly is unlikely to mean more cost-effective care,'' said Dr.
Alvin Mushlin of the University of Rochester Medical Center.
   Researchers estimate that each year, 150,000 American women
develop breast cancer and about 44,000 die from the disease. Breast
cancer rates could be lowered about 30 percent if women received
mammograms as recommended by the National Cancer Institute,
according to several earlier studies.
   Although an estimated 10,000 mammography machines were installed
in U.S. medical facilities by 1990, only about 2,600 are really
needed, the study said.
   Brown said the study's estimate was based on accepted
recommendations for screening mammograms, nationwide figures on the
number of machines and an average cost of about $100 per test.
   ``Even with some follow-up diagnostic tests, we can't come close
to accounting for all those machines,'' Brown said.
   The high number of machines reduces the number of clients per
machine, keeping costs high, he said. Money spent on the excess
machines could be better spent on record-keeping and follow-up
care, he said.
   If the cost of the test was lowered from $100 to $50 by using
fewer machines, the country could save $763 million a year in
health costs, he said.
   Mushlin said the study indicates clearly that the supply of
mammography machines far exceeds the needed number, and predicted
that the gap would only increase.
   The NCI is now conducting a nationwide survey of all facilities
with mammography machines to further examine the issues raised by
the study, Brown said.
   Although the study did not analyze the reasons for the rapidly
increasing number of mammography machines, Brown speculated that
hospitals perceive that the demand for breast cancer screening will
continue to grow while the cost of the machines themselves is
relatively low.
   A CDC survey earlier this year found that 64 percent of women 40
and older have had a mammogram, up from 37 percent in 1987.

   New England Patriots owner Victor Kiam on Sunday
promised ``mammoth changes'' in the football team's management
after a sports reporter said she was sexually harassed by players
in the locker room.
   Kiam said he was misled ``by my own people'' about the
seriousness of the incident and again offered his apologies to
reporter Lisa Olson while the two appeared on NBC-TV's ``NFL
Live.''
   Olson said on Sept. 17 several Patriots players made lewd
comments while she was conducting post-game interviews in the
locker room. Kiam originally brushed aside the comments, saying
``it was a flyspeck in the ocean.''
   But on Sunday he said he was calling upon Patriot players to
come forward with more information about the exchange.
   ``There will be mammoth changes'' in the Patriots management,
Kiam said, without elaborating. ``I have just met with Lisa. I'm
not ready yet to determine what I will do to the fullest extent.''
   National Football League commissioner Paul Tagliabue said later
Sunday he told Kiam not to make changes until the NFL's
investigation of the incident is complete.
   A Patriots player was fined in connection with the incident.
   Olson, a reporter for the Boston Herald, said Kiam's apology
``was a start.''
   Kiam placed full-page advertisements Sunday in Boston and New
York newspapers. ``There's no excuse for what happened in the
locker room,'' the ads said. But Kiam also asserted, ``I never
called Lisa Olson a (bitch).''
   Kiam was reported to have called Olson a ``classic bitch'' in
the locker room after a game. Kiam denied he used those words, and
the newspaper ads quoted three university officials who say they
were next to Kiam and did not hear him use those words.
   The Boston chapter of the National Organization of Women has
condemned both the football team and Kiam and suggested that women
boycott products made by Remington, Kiam's Connecticut company
which makes electric shavers.
   Kiam said his apology to Olson last week came ``before any
boycott was mentioned.''

<TEXT>
   India and Pakistan have temporarily
suspended talks seeking to reduce border tension in the troubled
Kashmir region, a Pakistani Foreign Ministry official said Sunday.
   ``Talks are still on, but no date for a further round has been
set,'' Foreign Secretary Shaharyar M. Khan said.
   Pakistan wanted the third round of negotiations to be held
before mid-October, but India objected and proposed a session later
in the month. Pakistan, however, will hold parliamentary elections
Oct. 24 and officials did not want the talks to coincide.
   Both countries are scheduled to attend a November summit of
South Asian nations, so direct talks on Kashmir probably won't be
scheduled before December, senior Asian diplomats said.
   More than 1,200 people have died this year in escalating
violence linked to a Moslem insurgency in the Indian province of
Jammu-Kashmir. Other parts of the territory are controlled by
Pakistan.
   New Delhi accuses Pakistan of aiding militant forces demanding
independence. Pakistan denies the charge, but says it supports the
Kashmiris' right to self-determination.
   About 65 percent of Jammu-Kashmir's 6 million people are Moslem.
About three-quarters of India's population is Hindu.
   The United States and other Western countries have urged the
traditionally hostile neighbors to work toward resolving the
conflict, which began with the 1947 partition of colonial India
into predominantly Moslem Pakistan and the mostly Hindu India.
   The two countries have twice gone to war over the territory, in
1947-48 and in 1965. The wars have left Kashmir divided into
Pakistani and Indian sectors.
   They fought a third war in 1971 over Bangladesh, then called
East Pakistan. Pakistan has lost all three wars.

<TEXT>
   Once again, an 11th-hour budget compromise has
delayed fiscal chaos. But the agreement that President Bush
insisted on Sunday was not ``smoke and mirrors'' will still leave a
gaping budget deficit.
   For it to work, the agreement's major initial impact must be
psychological. It must give financial markets enough confidence
that interest rates will begin a downward slide.
   Even though the plan announced at a hastily summoned Rose Garden
ceremony holds out the promise of deeper savings down the road, it
will not prevent the fiscal 1991 deficit from setting a new record
for red-ink spending.
   Ironically, even as congressional and White House budget
negotiators were putting the finishing touches on the deal to pare
the federal deficit by $40 billion in the new fiscal year, budget
officials were upping the estimate of the deficit by a similar
amount.
   Just a week ago, budget negotiators were talking about a $250
billion shortfall in the absence of spending cuts and tax
increases.
   Now there is a budget agreement, but even its enactment - by no
means certain - would produce a deficit of some $254 billion.
   That's because on Sunday, Budget Director Richard Darman
increased the estimate for the fiscal 1991 deficit to $293.7
billion.
   That's up from the $100 billion he estimated in January and the
$231 billion he estimated in July. He blamed economic performance
and the spiraling costs of the savings and loan bailout for the
latest upward revision.
   And that new figure assumes that oil retreats from its current
$40-a-barrel to $21-$24; that war doesn't break out in the Middle
East; and that the economy doesn't totter into a recession.
   So the final figures could be even worse.
   Compare the $253 billion level with the target in the
Gramm-Rudman budget balancing law of $64 billion.
   It would take spending cuts of some $130 billion to get spending
in line with that target - not the $40 billion of the agreement or
the $100 billion talked about over the past few weeks.
   Under the budget compromise, the $64 billion figure and all the
other Gramm-Rudman targets would be abandoned and new targets
established that would give the government five additional years to
reach a balanced budget beyond the 1993 deadline called for in the
present law.
   Thus, the balanced budget that President Reagan once promised by
1983 is receding from grasp again.
   Now, budget negotiators don't envision a budget in balance until
near the end of the century.
   ``The markets are not looking at the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings
targets as if that's reality, the ones in current law,'' Darman
said.
   No one really believes ``we're on a path to meet those
targets,'' he conceded. ``That's been obvious for months if not
more than a year.''
   That's not to say the measures contained in the compromise won't
amount to a heavy dose of medicine that will be hard for many
Americans to swallow.
   The pact calls for a 12-cent increase in the nine-cent gasoline
tax and sharply higher taxes on cigarettes and alcoholic beverages.
It would make Medicare coverage more expensive and allows many
government programs to rise only with the rate of inflation.
   For the wealthy and upper middle-class taxpayers, the package
would have much same effect as an income tax rate increase by
limiting the deductions that can be claimed by those making more
than $100,000 annually - either single taxpayers or joint filers.
   And the measure would impose new taxes on the sale of luxury
items, including boats and expensive cars, but not high-end
electronic equipment as once contemplated.
   ``It is not a phony smoke-and-mirrors deficit-cutting program,''
Bush said Sunday, vowing to take the package ``to the American
people.''
   Just two days ago, he was telling Republican audiences in the
Midwest that the case he would take to the American people was the
one against Democrats in Congress.
   Bush made two major concessions in the course of the talks:
first agreeing, in July, to back away from his ``no new taxes''
pledge; and then, just within the past few days, abandoning his
insistence on a lower capital gains tax rate.
   Did Bush give up more than he gained? ``I don't think we're
going to get into the hot rhetoric of what gain or loss there is in
terms of - political terms. There will be a lot of time for that to
take place in the days and weeks ahead,'' White House chief of
staff John Sununu said Sunday.

   Congress on Sunday approved President Bush's
request for a temporary increase in the national debt.
   The legislation, approved by voice votes in the House and the
Senate, will permit the Treasury to keep borrowing to cover
government expenses through the end of the week.
   The Treasury's current debt limit of $3.195 billion is scheduled
to drop back to $3.123 billion at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday. Without
more borrowing power, the Treasury could be forced to default on
Thursday, according to Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady.
   The bill sent to the president on Sunday night will keep the
Treasury at the higher borrowing level through Friday. Congress is
expected to consider another debt extension then.
   A long-term debt bill is being delayed until completion of the
legislation enacting the budget deal between Congress and the
president.

   A Nashville businessman says he'll pay
Mayor Bill Boner's $75,000 annual salary if the mayor - who's
received more publicity lately for his love life than his politics
- will resign.
   Businessman Lee Beaman says Boner's romantic entanglements, and
the media attention that accompanied them, have distracted the
mayor from his work.
   Boner, 45, is in Hawaii with his fiancee, aspiring country music
singer Traci Peel, 34. Boner was still married to and living with
his third wife when he announced his engagement to Peel in July.
   ``It is obvious to all of Nashville that Bill Boner is
distracted from his job,'' said Beaman, head of Beaman Automotive
Group and an officer of Beaman Bottling Co.
   ``For the good of the city, Bill Boner should resign so we can
elect a mayor in a special election and move our city forward,''
said Beaman, who offered to pay Boner's salary to sweeten the deal.
   Beaman on Friday said he first made the offer a month ago.
   Boner was expected to marry Ms. Peel in Hawaii Monday, four days
after his divorce became final.
   The Democratic mayor has a year left in his term and has
announced he will not seek re-election.
   His spokesman, Rick Runyeon, said Boner was ``committed to
fulfilling his term of office.''

<HEAD>Brazilian President Laments Past Help To Iraq</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   NEW YORK (P) - Brazilian President Fernando Collor de Mello told
President Bush on Sunday that his country had provided nuclear
technology to Iraq in the past and now lamented the action, a
senior U.S. official said.
   Collor described President Saddam Hussein as ``insane'' and said
aggression cannot be permitted to succeed, Assistant Secretary of
State Bernard Aronson told reporters during a briefing on Bush's
meeting with the Brazilian leader.
   Iraq is known to have relied on a number of foreign sources to
try to develop a nuclear capability.
   The Bush administration believes Iraq has begun production of
chemical and biological weapons, but it has not asserted that
Baghdad is turning out nuclear arms.
   Collor described the information Brazil had given to Iraq as
``potentially significant,'' but did not provide further details.
   ``The president of Brazil lamented the fact that there had been
some informal, clandestine relations with Iraq in the past that had
involved the trading of some potentially significant information
involving nuclear technology.'' according to Aronson.
   It was not clear whether the trade was sanctioned by the
government, although the Brazilian president said he renounced
``all such efforts.''
   He also said he supported legislation that would prevent former
government officials from trading nuclear secrets after they return
to private life.
   Collor said in one instance a former Army officer involved in
Brazil's nuclear program became involved in an Iraqi project.
   As for Brazil itself, Aronson said, Collor promised the South
American country would not launch any kind of nuclear project.
   To demonstrate his resolve, Collor said he recently visited a
secret Army nuclear project and threw a shovel-full of lime down
the mine shaft as ``a symbolic closing of this effort.''
   Iraq and Brazil are two of some 20 nations believed by American
experts either to have the capability of producing nuclear weapons
or to have actually begun to turn them out.
   Bush also met with President Carlos Andres of Venezuela and
thanked him for playing a leading role in persuading the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase oil
production.
   The aim is to make up for the boycott of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil
which is being boycotted in an effort to force Saddam Hussein to
reverse his invasion of Kuwait.

   The Labor Party opened its annual conference
Sunday looking like a formidable contender for power, but signs
emerged that the Persian Gulf crisis was eroding Labor's lead over
the Conservative government in surveys.
   Three opinion polls published over the weekend indicated Labor's
lead down to between five and nine points, compared to about 15
points a month ago and a record 24 percent last March.
   The weeklong conference in the north England resort of Blackpool
was to endorse the socialist party's new, moderate platform, which
ditches old tenets of the left from unilateral nuclear disarmament
to promises to repeal union-curbing laws.
   The platform has helped push Labor into its strongest position
to regain power since Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher ousted the
last Labor government in 1979.
   The government remains in deep economic trouble. But the polls
indicated Mrs. Thatcher benefiting from strong public support for
sending warplanes, naval vessels and ground troops to the gulf, and
the general perception that she is good in a crisis.
   ``There is the beginning of a gulf effect, but it is indirect,''
said political analyst Peter Kellner. ``It is having an effect on
the standing of the party leaders.''
   Kellner was commenting on a National Opinion Poll sounding
published Saturday in a London newspaper, the Independent, which
indicated Labor had 44 percent support and the Conservatives 39
percent.
   The poll, like most of those on the weekend, indicated the
centrist Social and Liberal Democratic Party had nearly doubled its
support to 12 percent following its annual conference two weeks
ago.
   Few of those surveyed cited the gulf as a major influence on how
they would vote, but large majorities supported the Thatcher policy
in the crisis.
   Since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, Mrs. Thatcher has
identified Britain closely with the U.S. military buildup in the
Persian Gulf.
   For the first time this year, Mrs. Thatcher's personal standing
overtook that of Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock in the National
Opinion Poll sounding.
   Kinnock has upset the party's left wing by assiduously
supporting the Thatcher policy on the gulf.
   Party managers were confident of marginalizing the left wing,
headed by former Energy Secretary Tony Benn.
   ``All pressure is on to maintain the unity we have so painfully
achieved,'' Bryan Gould, Labor's campaign manager and environment
spokesman said.
   Labor's new 20,000-word policy document reflects how far right
Mrs. Thatcher has pushed the British political agenda.
   The document incorporates many of her union curbs and drops
previous promises to renationalize most of the state-owned
enterprises she has sold off.
   Labor leaders say they envisage a top income tax rate of 50
percent - compared to 40 percent now and 83 percent when Labor was
last in power.
   The Tories meet next week.
   This year's party conferences could be the last before the next
general election. Mrs. Thatcher's five-year term ends in mid-1992,
but governing parties often call elections a year early.

   Israel and the Soviet Union announced
Sunday that they are opening consulates in each other's countries
after a 23-year break in ties.
   The decision, announced after a meeting between Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy and his Soviet counterpart, Eduard
Shevardnadze, represented a major step in retoring relations that
were severed after the 1967 Middle East War.
   Consular relations are a level below full diplomatic relations.
   The two ministers also told reporters at the United Nations that
they intend to start meeting regularly and that their foreign
ministries will be in regular contact.
   In Jerusalem, a senior Israeli official said direct airline
flights between the Soviet Union and Israel will begin within a
month.
   Yossi Ahimeir, a spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir,
said the Soviets did not provide further details about the
arrangement. The Soviet news agency Tass reported Sunday that Levy
and Shevardnadze discussed air service, but decided to continue
talks later.
   The national airlines of the two countries, Aeroflot and El Al,
signed a direct-flight agreement last year, but Aeroflot then said
it needed approval from Soviet leaders before the service could
being.
   The flights could accelerate the exodus of Jews from the Soviet
Union to Israel, which is already straining to accommodate more
than 100,000 Soviet newcomers who have arrived since last year.
   The Kremlin broke ties with Israel after the 1967 war, during
which Israel seized territory from Moscow's Arab allies.
   A thaw between the two countries began in 1987, when the Soviets
posted a delegation in Tel Aviv that operated through the Finnish
Embassy.
   A year later, Israel established a low-level mission in Moscow
operating through the Netherlands Embassy.
   Relations have improved in part because Moscow wants to play a
role in Middle East diplomacy.
   Asked about word from Israeli officials that Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev has authorized direct flights between the
Soviet Union and Israel, Shevardnadze said that was a complicated
issue to be discussed further.
   A spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir announced
in Jerusalem on Saturday that the flights would begin in a month.
They were expected to accelerate the emigration of Soviet Jews to
Israel.
   Levy and Shevardnadze met for an hour in the chambers of the
U.N. Security Council president, the rotating post occupied by the
Soviet Union for the month of September.
   The two leaders arrived separately, Levy solemn-faced and
declining comment. They emerged after the meeting, shaking hands
and both smiling.
   ``We have decided - and I am happy to report this - to establish
full consular ties between our two countries,'' Levy told Israel
radio, speaking in Hebrew.
   Shevardnadze told nearly reporters that Israel would be opening
a consulate-general, the highest level consulate, in Moscow, and
the Soviet Union would open a consulate-general in Tel Aviv.
   The Soviet leader described Sunday's talks as interesting and
businesslike. He said the two countries' contacts and exchanges
have been developing in many areas.
   Arrangements for openings of the new diplomatic missions will be
discussed in the next week or 10 days, he said.

   About 30,000 Colombians attended a Mass
on Sunday to pray for the safety of seven journalists apparently
kidnapped by the Medellin cocaine cartel.
   The government of President Cesar Gaviria has said it has no
evidence indicating who might be holding the journalists. But
Colombian news media received calls claiming drug traffickers'
responsibility for the abductions from a man identified by security
forces as a cartel member.
   A Sunday column in El Tiempo newspaper voiced the frustration of
many Colombians over failure to rescue the journalists.
   ``It seems prayer is the only resource that can be used to help
find them safe and sound,'' it read.
   Families of the victims, government officials and national
celebrities were among those attending the midday Mass at a Bogota
plaza.
   Among the missing journalists was Diana Turbay de Uribe, editor
of a Bogota news magazine and daughter of former President Julio
Cesar Turbay.
   She was among a group of six journalists who disappeared Aug. 30
after leaving Bogota to interview leaders of a leftist guerrilla
group, the National Liberation Army.
   The rebels denied they were holding the journalists, and rumors
spread they were in the hands of the Medellin cartel. Two
kidnappings on Sept. 19 - including another journalist - added to
speculation the cartel had resumed its campaign of terror after
declaring a cease-fire July 27.
   Hours after abductors seized Marina Montoya, sister of
Colombia's ambassador to Canada, an armed band kidnapped Francisco
Santos Calderon, El Tiempo's managing editor, after shooting and
killing his chauffeur.
   A telephone caller told El Tiempo the cartel was holding all
eight kidnap victims to try to force the government to grant
amnesty to traffickers for past crimes.
   Gaviria has said the government will not pardon the traffickers'
crimes, which include murdering scores of political leaders, judges
and journalists.
   In September, the government offered to hold the trials of
surrendering traffickers in Colombia and not extradite them to the
United States. Gaviria also decreed reduced prison sentences for
drug suspects who cooperate with authorities.
   A cartel statement rejected the government offer.

   The city offered to agree to expand the board
of trustees of the University of the District of Columbia to end a
student protest that has kept the school closed since last week,
university officials said Sunday.
   Negotiations continued between school officials and students who
occupied two buildings, including the university's administrative
offices.
   Trustees Joseph Webb and Alonza Evans said they had reached
agreement with the students on 39 of their 44 demands.
   The students were demanding extensive changes in the public
institution, including the resignation of 11 of the 15 trustees.
   They claim the board has allowed the quality of the school's
academic programs to decline.
   The two trustees said they offered to support a city council
bill to expand the board of trustees from 15 to 21 members.
   There was no word from students on how they greeted that
proposal. But Mark Thompson, a leader of the student protest, said
the occupation would not end until all demands are met.
   Trustees of UDC, which enrolls about 12,000 students, cannot be
forced to resign. They are nominated by the mayor and confirmed by
council members.
   Two trustees have resigned voluntarily and others won't resign
while the protest is going on because ``they're just not going to
resign under duress.''
   Webb said the protesting students, who number around 300, have
made their point.
   ``I wish they students would stop seeing the board as their
enemy because I think the board indeed has been awakened,'' he
said.
   Among the incidents that incited the protest was the
financially-strapped university's decision to spend $1.6 million so
that it could acquire the controversial feminist artwork ``The
Dinner Party.''
   That issue had not been resolved Sunday, Webb and Evans said.
   Trustees have said they would reopen the school Monday.

   World leaders ended an unprecedented
meeting Sunday by pledging huge resources to battle the scourges of
childhood poverty, and with harsh words for those who commit
atrocities in the name of the young.
   The 72 kings, presidents and prime ministers concluded the
two-day World Summit for Children by adopting a declaration
promising to fight the hunger, disease and illiteracy affecting
children.
   The summit, the largest gathering ever of international leaders,
was aimed at mobilizing governments to save up to 100 million
children from death by disease and malnutrition in the 1990s.
   The final declaration was signed by Louis Sullivan, U.S.
secretary of health and human services. Earlier there had been
concern the United States might not endorse the plan because it
urges ratification of a pact that opposes the death penalty for
those under 18 - a practice in some U.S. states.
   Officials at the summit estimated that achieving the
declaration's goals would cost billions of dollars, but the accord
gave no monetary figure, and it relies on the goodwill of nations
for contributions.
   Summit organizers said World Bank president Barber Conable Jr.
has pledged $500 million per year in a separate program for health
and education for children. More than 1 million children could be
saved each year by the additional funds, they said.
   Many of the world's leaders gave at least brief speeches during
the meeting, which also provided a forum for bilateral discussions
on a variety of themes, not the least of which was the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia said leaders from Adolf
Hitler to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had committed evil for the
supposed benefit of children.
   ``Thousands of times I have heard people defending their
servitude to a hated regime by the argument that they were doing it
only for their children,'' Havel told the assembly. ``Immorality
was thus committed in the name of children and evil was served for
their alleged good.''
   ``I saw Hitler waving in a friendly way to the fanatic little
girls of Hitlerjugend (Hitler Youth). I saw mass murderer Stalin
kissing a child with the red Communist youth organization scarf ...
I saw Iraqi President Hussein patting children of his hostages
whom, as he now says, he is ready to have shot,'' said Havel.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher noted the sufferings of
children in war-ravaged countries such as Mozambique and Lebanon.
   ``These are evil things ... evil things done by wicked people,''
Mrs. Thatcher said. ``They bring us hard up against the fundamental
nature of human personality and character.''
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar told the
assembly, ``There is no way we can reconcile humanity's remarkable
progress with the continuance of the misery that counts children
among its victims.''
   President Bush said childrens can be saved when adults ``live up
to our responsibilities.'' But, he said, ``saving one child is a
miracle.''
   ``We hold an unprecedent summit for those who will live in and
lead a new world, their voices still faint and unheard,'' Bush
said. ``We are gathered to speak for the children of the earth ...
to defy statistics.''
   During the two-day summit, the United Nations estimates 2,800
children worldwide died of whooping cough, 8,000 more from measles,
4,000 from tetanus, 5,500 from malaria, 22,000 from diarrhea and
12,000 from pneumonia - all preventable ailments.
   Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, noting that universal
education was the foundation for Japan's economic success,
advocated extra pay and status for public school teachers around
the world.
   ``National development can take place only when all people have
the opportunity to receive an education. There should be no more
argument as to which should come first - economic development or
education,'' he said.
   Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez noted the problems of
homeless children, child refugees and child laborers in Latin
America are ``intolerable consequences'' of the huge foreign debts
of many countries in the region.
   Bush departed from the summit early in order to attend budget
negotiations in Washington. He was scheduled to address the U.N.
General Assembly on Monday.
   Summit leaders were escorted to their seats in the
emerald-carpeted General Assembly Hall by children in national
costume holding miniature flags of their countries. Large portraits
of children from every continent adorned the walls. A children's
chorus sang of peace.
   Bush was escorted by Jostin Lebo, 14, of Palisades, N.J., who
repairs bicycles for less-fortunate children.
   U.S. aides called him one of the ``thousand points of light,''
sought by Bush as an example of people helping others.
   The final draft declaration - the action plan for the summit -
commits nations to work toward signing the U.N. Convention on the
Rights of the Child, already ratified by more than 40 nations.
   The U.S. government has not signed the U.N. rights convention.
Conservatives take exception to the fact that it does not define a
fetus as a child with rights and bans the death penalty for people
under 18.
   The 700-word draft declaration was read to the gathering by
children, who then passed it around for signature.
   Afterward, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said: ``The
real work starts now.''
   The declaration resolves the signatories to:
   -reduce child mortality below age 5 by one-third or to a level
of 70 per 1,000 births, whichever is the greater reduction;
   -cut mortality rates of mothers in childbirth by half;
   -reduce malnutrition among children under 5 by half;
   -assure universal access to safe drinking water and septic
systems;
   -provide universal access to basic education, and have at least
80 percen of primary school children finish school;
   -protect children in dangerous circumstances, especially in
armed conflict.
   A clause was added to the declaration at Kuwait's urging
denouncing the suffering of children because of ``aggression,
foreign occupation and annexation.'' No specific countries are
named in the declaration.

   President Bush informed Czech President Vaclav
Havel on Sunday night that he is lifting travel restrictions on
Czechoslovakia's diplomats in the United States.
   The travel restrictions were imposed before the East European
country abandoned communism.
   Bush and Havel conferred in Bush's suite at the Waldorf Astoria
Hotel. Both presidents earlier attended the World Summit for
Children at the United Nations, and Bush is addressing the U.N.
General Assembly on Monday.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush thanked
Havel for his country's ``early support of the U.N. sanctions
against Iraq.'' He quoted Bush as saying, ``We understand your
sacrifices in supporting the U.N. embargo and we are grateful.''
   Havel, a playwright and former prisoner under the communist
regime, was elected president last year. He told Bush his country
is making considerable progress in reforming its economy.
   Fitzwater said Bush told Havel the United States' is keenly
interested in the success of those reforms. ``We want to see you
succeed,'' he said.

   A stuntman tied a strap to his
long, curly hair on Sunday and used it to pull a Boeing 737-200
aircraft more than 55 feet under a blazing sun at Kuala Lumpur's
airport.
   Urged on by cheering spectators, stuntman R. Letchemanaah, 40,
tugged the 28-ton Malaysia Airlines plane and the four tons of fuel
it was carrying.
   A crowd of about 500 watched the feat at the airport, and an
estimated 1 million people watched on live television.
   The national news agency Bernama said it first appeared as if
Letchemanaah, dubbed ``Malaysia's mighty man,'' might not be able
to move the plane. At one point, his feet slipped on the tarmac.
   He tightened the end of the strap tied to his hair, again faced
the crowd, clenched his teeth and fists, leaned over and began to
pull the jetliner slowly forward.
   Letchemanaah, a laboratory assistant with the Rubber Research
Institute and a vegetarian, said he went on a special diet for two
weeks to prepare for the feat.
   He said the stunt was a ``matter of concentration.''
   Letchemanaah's stunts mostly involve pulling heavy things: A bus
with 27 passengers (100 feet); a 6-ton vehicle (with his teeth). He
once had his arm run over by a truck without complaint.
   Letchemanaah's son, Tiagarajan, 13, said he hopes to emulate his
father and has been training to pull a car with his teeth.

<TEXT>
   Vietnamese and Chinese officials
meeting in Beijing last week said they hoped to normalize relations
between the two countries, the official Vietnam News Agency has
reported.
   Although Beijing and Hanoi maintain ambassadors in each other's
capitals, relations have been cool in the past decade because the
two countries support warring sides in Cambodia and other
territorial disputes.
   Hanoi's deputy prime minister, Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, returned
from a highly public visit to China on Friday. His trip, during the
Asian Games, was the most senior public contact between China and
Vietnam since they fought a border war in 1979.
   Giap met Chinese Premier Li Peng last Monday and ``the two
officials exchanged views on all issues relating to the relations
between the two countries and other issues of common concern,'' the
Vietnam News Agency reported.
   ``They also expressed their wish that the traditional friendship
between the Vietnamese and the Chinese peoples would be restored
soon ... and the friendship and cooperation between the two
countries would be normalized,'' it said.
   Giap was briefed by Chinese officials on China's economic,
scientific and technical reforms, the report added.
   Until 1989, Beijing dismissed all Vietnam's attempts at
high-level dialogue. Cambodia is the main divisive issue.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1978 and ousted the Khmer Rouge, now
a guerrilla army backed by China. China also supports two other
guerrilla groups against the Hanoi-installed Cambodian government.
   Early this month, Vietnam's Communist Party chief Nguyen Van
Linh, Prime Minister Do Muoi and former-premier Pham Van Dong paid
a secret visit to Beijing, Western diplomats and Thai officials
said.

<TEXT>
   Supporters of Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki on Sunday endorsed his presidential candidacy against
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa.
   Unlike Walesa, Mazowiecki has made no formal announcement of his
presidential bid. He was in the United States this week for a U.N.
meeting on children and talks with President Bush.
   ``We think that Tadeusz Mazowiecki has been unable to announce
his candidacy yet due to procedural reasons,'' said Jan Litynski, a
leader of the the Citizens Movement for Democratic Action, known by
its Polish acronym ROAD. ``We are convinced that he will decide to
run after the election schedule is set.''
   President Wojciech Jaruzelski, the former Communist Party
leader, agreed to curtail the six-year term he began in 1989 by 4{
years, and the presidential election is expected to take place as
early as Nov. 25.
   Walesa nominated Mazowiecki, his former adviser and ally, for
prime minister n August 1989.
   The Solidarity leader is supported by the other major political
group in Poland, the Center Alliance. Representatives of about 50
local Christian Democratic clubs announced their support for
Walesa's candidacy at a meeting in Warsaw Sunday.
   The clubs consider themselves right of center. Parliament Deputy
Stefan Niesiolowski told a TV newscast support for Walesa is ``the
only solution in view of the leftist option still ruling in
Poland.''
   Walesa had a celebratory weekend, observing his 47th birthday
Saturday and marrying off his oldest son, Bogdan, 21, to Agnieszka
Drozdowska the same day.
   He received birthday wishes from fellow worshipers after Sunday
Mass at St. Brygida's Church, a few blocks from the shipyard in
Gdansk where he led strikes in 1980 and 1988 that ultimately
changed the political face of Poland.
   Referring to his presidential campaighn, Walesa told residents
gathered in the churchyard after the service that he hoped ``a
lively sea wind will keep coming to Poland from Gdansk as it has
for the past 10 years.''

   Actor Peter Boyle was hospitalized Sunday
after apparently suffering a mild stroke, a hospital official said.
   Boyle, 54, was in fair condition in the intensive care unit at
University of Utah Health Sciences Center, said nursing supervisor
Charlene Barrett.
   Boyle, in Utah to work on an unidentified film project, was
taken to the hospital after experiencing ``mild weakness and a
headache,'' Barrett said.
   Boyle, best known for his comedic acting, was nomitated for a
1989 emmy as guest actor in the television drama series, ``Midnight
Caller.''
   His film credits include ``Young Frankenstein,'' ``Taxi
Driver,'' ``F.I.S.T.,'' the ``Dream Team,'' and most recently,
``Speed Zone,'' opposite comedian John Candy.
   He also starred in the short-lived ABC series, ``Joe Bash,'' in
1986.

   In a major day in Soviet foreign
relations, the Kremlin established full diplomatic relations with
South Korea on Sunday and announced it was upgrading its relations
with Israel after a 23-year rupture.
   The pact with the Soviets was seen as a major victory for the
Seoul government and a devastating setback for Communist North
Korea.
   The Soviet Union has been a major ally and arms provider for
North Korea.
   The decision by the Soviets and Israel to open consulates in
each other's country, announced after a meeting between Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy, represented a major step in restoring relations severed
after the 1967 Middle East War. Israel seized territory from
Moscow's Arab allies during that conflict.
   Consular relations are a level below full diplomatic eelations.
   Soviet diplomats also were busy Sunday working on a draft U.N.
resolution to authorize the use of military force against Iraq if
previous measures by the world body - including a world economic
embargo and an embargo on air traffic -fail to force Iraq to
retreat from Kuwait, U.S. officials said.
   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Soviets and Americans were putting their heads together on the
issue and that other delegations also are drafting proposed
resolutions - all with the view of being ready to act against Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein to restore Kuwait's national legitimacy.
   After Shevardnadze and South Korea's Choi Ho-joong signed an
agreement establishing ties, they issued a joint communique and
stood together in a U.N. corridor, smiling and answering questions.
   Choi said both sides agreed to exchange high-level visits and
that a Soviet trade and economic delegation will visit Seoul next
month to discuss broad economic cooperation.
   Shevardnadze called South Korea an important factor for peace in
the region and said, ``We believe that establishing diplomatic
relations between the Soviet Union and South Korea will aid the
cause of stability in Asia and the Pacific region.''
   South Korea has long pushed for ties with Moscow, and the
Soviets are eager for enhanced trade and economic cooperation to
help bolster a sinking economy.
   Sunday's move was expected to give South Korea more leverage in
its bid to join the United Nations as a full member separately from
North Korea.
   Shevardnadze and Levy told reporters they intend to start
meeting regularly and that the foreign ministries of the Kremlin
and the Jewish state will be in regular contact. Shevardnadze said
Israel would open a consulate-general - the highest level consulate
- in Moscow, and the Soviets would open a consulate-general in Tel
Aviv.
   Yossi Ahimeir, a spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir,
said in Jerusalem that direct airline flights between the Soviet
Union and Israel will begin within a month.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said Levy and Shevardnadze discussed
air service, but decided to continue talks later.
   Such flights could accelerate the exodus of Soviet Jews to
Israel, which is already straining to accommodate more than 100,000
Soviet emigres who arrived since last year.

   A barrage of rockets slammed into the
Afghan capital of Kabul on Sunday, and 10 people were killed when
one of the rockets hit a crowded market, Kabul Radio said.
   The state-run radio, monitored in Islamabad, said up to 36
people were killed by the rockets, fired by insurgents who have
been fighting for more than 12 years to topple Afghanistan's
Communist-style government.
   ``These attacks are against all principles of Islam,'' the
broadcast said.
   Afghanistan's governing Hezb-e-Watan, or Homeland Party, has
tried to forge an Islamic image since about about 115,000 Soviet
troops completed their withdrawal from the Central Asian nation in
February 1989.
   Soviet soldiers marched into Afghanistan in December 1979 to
prop up successive Communist governments and crush the Moslem
insurgency.
   Moscow still sends about $300 million a month in military and
humanitarian aid to Kabul.
   Washington contributes about $300 million annually to the
guerrillas, headquartered in Pakistan.

   A small plane crashed in the Olympic
National Forest, killing two people and sparking a fire, and two
more people died Sunday when their plane crashed while fighting the
blaze.
   A Lockheed Neptune P-2V firefighting plane crashed Sunday
afternoon about five miles from the first crash, said Grays Harbor
Sheriff's Deputy Ron Whiteman.
   The plane was dispatched by the U.S. Forest Service to help
fight a fire started when a single-engine Cessna 172 crashed
Saturday near Wynoochee Lake Dam. The dam is accessible by land
only by logging roads and hunting trails.
   The wreckage and fire, which consumed about 10 acres, were
spotted Sunday morning, said Tom Sayre at the U.S. Forest Service
office in Olympia.
   The twin-engine firefighting plane crashed Sunday afternoon near
the first crash site in the south end of the forest, about 60 miles
southwest of Seattle, Sayre said.
   The fire was expected to be controlled quickly, he said.
   The first plane was reported missing Saturday night after it
failed to return to Sanderson Field at Shelton.
   Killed were pilot David W. Wurscher, 46, of Bremerton and Tom
Eller, 62, of Newman Lake, said Brian Holmes of the transportation
department.
   Wurscher, who owned the plane, was training to become a search
pilot and Eller was an experienced search-pilot instructor, he
said.
   The four-engine Neptune was owned by Black Hills Aviation of
Alamogordo, N.M., said company president Arnold Kolb. Black Hills'
planes are contracted by the Forest Service throughout the West, he
said.
   Kolb declined to name the two men on board until their families
had been notified.
   Design of the Lockheed Neptune dates back to late 1940s. It has
two piston and two jet engines and was first designed for Navy
anti-submarine and patrol duty.

   A country music guitarist and his
promoter were killed Sunday when their plane crashed two miles
short of a runway in heavy fog, authorities said.
   Murry Kellum, 47, of Antioch, who had the 1963 hit ``Long Tall
Texan,'' and promoter Johnny D. Swanner, 55, of Hendersonville died
in the early morning crash, said Sumner County sheriff Richard
Sutton.
   Swanner was flying the single-engine plane and may have tried to
land in a corn field, said Sutton. There was heavy fog east of the
airport in Gallatin, which is about 25 miles northeast of
Nashville.
   Swanner ran Transworld Artists Inc. from his Hendersonville
home, said his wife, Rosa Swanner.
   The men were returning from a concert in Ada, Okla., and had
refueled in Memphis, she said.
   Kellum also co-wrote a hit song for the country group Alabama
called ``If You're Gonna Play in Texas (You've Gotta Have a Fiddle
in the Band),'' Mrs. Swanner said.

<HEAD>Thousands of Lebanese Support Aoun against Blockade</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Thousands of clapping supporters
demonstrated around the Presidential Palace in suburban Baabda
Sunday, declaring support for rebel Gen. Michel Aoun against an
economic blockade by President Elias Hrawi's army.
   They chanted ``Long live our general!'' and ``We shall break the
siege!'' when Aoun emerged from the bomb-shattered palace, waving
V-for-victory.
   ``Your presence here testifies to the will of the people to
stand fast against the government of corruption which is trying to
starve us into submission,'' he told the crowd.
   Aoun accused Hrawi's government of seeking the support of the
Syrian army to attack the enclave his 15,000 troops hold in parts
of east Beirut and the adjoining mountains in the Christian
heartland.
   ``The government of thieves is trying to build a Berlin Wall
between Beirut and our free zone. It is also seeking the support of
a foreign army to fight the Lebanese army,'' Aoun said.
   Beirut newspapers reported Sunday that Hrawi won a pledge of
support for such an attack from Syria's President Hafez Assad at a
Damascus meeting Saturday.
   Newspaper reports said Hrawi would order the military thrust to
evict Aoun from the Presidential Palace if the present blockade
against his 60-square-mile enclave fails to bring the maverick
general to heel quickly.
   Aoun refuses to recognize Hrawi's presidency, calling him a
Syrian puppet. Hrawi's 20,000-man army, mostly Moslems under Gen.
Emile Lahoud, closed all roads and banned food supplies from
entering Aoun's zone last week. Fuel and money transfers have been
prohibited since July.
   Hrawi, Aoun and Lahoud are Maronite Catholics, the sect that
dominated power in Lebanon since it gained independence from France
in 1943.
   Hrawi last week signed into law constitutional reforms giving
the 55 percent Moslem majority an equal share of power with the
Christians in a bid to end the 15-year-old civil war.
   Aoun rejected the reforms, contending they remain illegal until
approved by a nationwide referendum.

   There is no open season on incumbents in the
off-year elections five weeks away despite evidence of political
cynicism, signs of voter anger and talk of a backlash against
officeholders.
   When the votes are counted, most of the establishment is likely
to be right where it is, with new leases on office. The
dissatisfaction that shows in public opinion surveys and in the
popularity of limiting elective tenure has been translated into
voter uprisings only against a handful of clearly identifiable
targets.
   That showed most clearly in Massachusetts, where the real target
wasn't even running. Democratic primary election voters took out
their anger at retiring Gov. Michael S. Dukakis by turning to
outsiders over candidates with any linked to his administration,
which is plagued by an economic slump and was forced to push
through a sharp increase in state taxes.
   Tax increases and budget woes, not incumbency alone, are the
common denominator for governors in trouble. That's one of the
problems plaguing campaigning Republican governors in places like
Rhode Island, Kansas, Maine and Florida. And it was one of the
factors in the voluntary retirements of 10 governors who didn't run
again.
   Underscoring a primary election record that shows voters are
selective in punishing incumbents, Minnesota Democrats rewarded
one, renominating Gov. Rudy Perpich, who once had looked like a
loser. He's already served 10 years, longer than any other governor
in state history.
   And in all of Congress, with 435 House seats and 34 in the
Senate at stake next month, only one incumbent seeking a new term
was turned down for renomination. That sole loser was Rep. Donald
Lukens of Ohio, a Republican renounced by his own party after a sex
scandal.
   At this point, the Democrats think they can make significant
gains in the competition for governors, with 36 states at stake.
There are no signs of major change in the political lineup in
Congress, although Republicans still hope to beat the off-year odds
and gain a seat or two in the Senate, looking to better position
themselves for a bid at control in 1992.
   In Congress, most of what will happen on Nov. 6 already is
ordained. Both parties say there are only a handful of real
contests for House seats; Democratic National Chairman Ronald H.
Brown guesses the count of competitive districts at 20 of the 435,
others put it lower.
   Four senators seeking re-election, two Republicans and two
Democrats, have no major party opponents. There haven't been that
many uncontested Senate elections in 34 years. And nine more have
only token opposition.
   Ironically, at the same time, there seems to be growing
sentiment in favor of limiting the tenure of officeholders.
Oklahoma voters decided by a two-to-one margin to put a 12 year
limit on service in their state legislature. Term limits will be on
the general election ballot in California and Colorado, the latter
measure applying to members of Congress as well as state
officeholders. Leaders of an effort to do that nationally with a
constitutional amendment claim they are gaining support.
   That's one way out of a situation in which incumbents usually
win even though the voters who re-elect them say they don't like
the product.
   A survey conducted for the Times Mirror Center for the People
and the Press reflects the mood. ``Cynicism toward the political
system in general is growing as the public in unprecedented numbers
associates Republicans with wealth and greed, Democrats with
fecklessness and incompetence,'' that survey reported, saying the
result is political gridlock.
   It is gridlock that could be broken by a congressional shakeup
in 1992, even if the voters don't force the issue.
   Congressional redistricting guarantees changes in the House, and
campaign finance rules will make retirement a lucrative option for
dozens of veteran congressmen. Under the law, they can keep
leftover campaign funds for themselves only if they retire by the
end of the next Congress, an option worth $100,000 or more for 62
House members.

<HEAD>Third-World Businesses Come Through With Payments - And Interest</HEAD>

   While big banks and governments fret over their
$1.3 trillion in lending to the Third World, one nonprofit group
loaned $23.7 million dollars to Latin Americans last year - and got
virtually all of it back, with interest.
   Seamstresses, fruit vendors, carpenters and thousands of other
working poor, who power half of all economic activity in Latin
America, are beneficiaries of an innovative loan program developed
by Accion International.
   Working through affiliates in 12 Latin American nations, the
Massachusetts-based group provides ``small business'' loans to
those so poor they either cannot qualify for bank loans or must
resort to loan sharks.
   ``We are a nonprofit organization dedicated to reducing poverty
through the creation of jobs and increasing income,'' said Gabriela
Romanow, communications director at Accion International, in a
telephone interview.
   Accion International was founded in 1961 as a privae-sector
initiative to stimulate community development in Latin America. A
network of local Accion affiliates in Latin capitals screen
borrowers and approve loans at market interest rates.
   More than 40 nonprofit U.S. groups, large banks and private
donors finance the loan program, as does the U.S. Agency for
International Development.
   ``We have quite a few corporate donors and we also get money
from foundations and individuals as well,'' said Romanow.
   Accion's affiliates had 45,000 borrowers last year who took out
loans averaging $227. Romanow said the default rate was less than 2
percent.
   The reason? Borrowers put up sewing machines and work tools as
collateral. Individuals often apply for loans at community meetings
or in small groups, so, ``If you don't pay back, everyone knows,''
Romanow said.
   The success stories are many, like that of furniture maker Ramon
Uceta, who used his loans to escape poverty in Santo Domingo, the
Dominican Republic.
   ``Uceta borrowed $20 from a friend to make lamps out of wicker
and he made three and sold them for $8 each,'' Romanow said.
   ``He heard about Accion's affiliate and went in to ask for a
loan for his wicker business. About three years later, after 14
loans, this man who had a tiny shack in a really poor neighborhood,
was able to expand to 14 full-time employees.''
   She added, ``He obviously has been able to move from his little
wooden shack where he had no running water or electricity.''
   The loans also worked for Petrona Lopez of La Paz, Bolivia, who
would occasionally beg in the city streets but has now been able to
open her stand selling the national staple, potatoes.
   She and four others took out loans totaling $646.
   ``She now has her own stall in the market instead of selling for
other women,'' said Romanow. ``She has been able to buy herself new
clothing and is able to periodically to eat chicken, a luxury she
wasn't able to previously afford.''
   Other borrowers include ``tailors, seamstresses, cobblers, broom
makers, carpenters, mechanics, every kind of small-scale business
that people actually do because they can't find jobs in the
mainstream economy, so they start.''
   She noted that studies show such workers comprise 30 percent to
70 percent of the labor force in developing countries.

<HEAD>Budget-Cutting Agreement Would Pinch American Pocketbooks</HEAD>

   President Bush's budget deal with Congress
would dig deep into American pocketbooks. Medicare payments would
rise, taxes on gasoline, cigarettes, liquor and boats would go up.
Farmers' subsidies would get cut and government services would
shrink.
   ``It's going to be very painful for a lot of people,'' said
Senate GOP leader Bob Dole of Kansas, predicting a tough fight for
enough votes to get the agreement past Congress. ``The nay-sayers,
the nit-pickers may have a field day.''
   There's certainly plenty of unpopular stuff to choose from.
   -Taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel would more than double. The
current nine-cent levy would increase by five cents a gallon on
Dec. 1 and another five cents next July 1. In addition, there would
be a 2-cent-per-gallon tax on all petroleum products, except home
heating oil, beginning Jan. 1. That means the federal motor fuel
levy would top out at 21 cents a gallon.
   -The federal tax on cigarettes, now 16 cents a pack, would rise
four cents a pack on Jan. 1 and another four cents in 1993.
   -Medicare taxes and fees would increase, while benefits go down.
   Middle-income taxpayers, not just the elderly, would pay for
Medicare. Currently, the payroll tax of 1.45 percent stops after a
taxpayer's income hits $51,300. The budget deal would keep workers
- and employers - paying until a $73,000 income cap.
   State employees who currently don't pay the Medicare tax or
Social Security would be brought into the system.
   Meanwhile, Medicare patients would pay more of their doctor
bills. The annual deductible would double in two years from $75 to
$150; coverage for clinical testing would drop from full to 80
percent; and monthly premiums would rise from $28.60 to about $34
next year. By 1995, they would rise to about $54 a month.
   -Buyers of new cars, boats, jewelry and furs would pay a
national sales tax on luxury goods. The fee would be 10 percent on
the portion of car purchases above $30,000, boats and yachts above
$100,000, and jewelry and furs above $5,000.
   Boat owners also would be hit with a new Coast Guard fee, a $25
annual decal. And the Army Corps of Engineers would begin charging
fees at recreational sites it oversees.
   -Most individuals or families with in excess of $100,000 in
annual income would pay more income taxes, with the government
disallowing 3 percent of itemized deductions. But medical expenses
or investment interest would not be limited beyond what they
already are.
   -Taxes on beer, wine and other alcoholic beverages would rise
although the exact figures remained to be decided. Tax on a six
pack of beer would go up 20 cents to 36 cents. Wine would cost
about 33 cents more for a regular-size bottle. The three-cent
federal tax on wine hasn't changed in nearly 40 years. Hard-liquor
taxes would also go up $1.20 per gallon of distilled spirits.
   While taxpayers would be shelling out more money, government
spending would be cut back in many areas. There would be broad cuts
in government defense and domestic spending.
   -Farm support programs would be cut $13 billion over five years.
   -Providers of Medicare services would be forced to absorb a
portion of rising costs equal to roughly $32 billion over the next
five years.

   President Bush and congressional leaders on
Sunday forged a $500-billion, five-year compromise package of tax
increases and spending cuts, spurring Congress to quick action on a
stopgap spending measure needed to avoid slashes in federal
services Monday.
   The House approved the temporary financing bill just three hours
after the budget agreement was described by President Bush in a
Rose Garden announcement, and the Senate quickly followed.
   ``It is balanced, it is fair, and in my view it is what the
United States of America needs at this point in its history,'' Bush
said in announcing an agreement that concluded budget negotiations
that began in May.
   The package contained $134 billion in new tax revenues,
including new taxes on gasoline, cigarettes, alcohol and luxury
items. Medicare costs for the elderly and disabled were increased;
defense spending was slashed as well.
   On a 382-41 vote, the House passed what is called a continuing
appropriations resolution to keep the government operating at full
speed through next Friday while lawmakers weight the proposed
budget compromise.
   The resolution, which then passed the Senate by voice vote, also
includes $2 billion in new appropriations for the Desert Shield
operations in the Persian Gulf.
   Arrangements were being made to fly the legislation to Bush in
New York Sunday evening, but it was not clear whether he would sign
the measure prior to a technical midnight expiration of the
existing budget. As a practical matter, however, the exact timing
of his signature - which was a certainty - was not significant as
long as it occurred within a day or so.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., praised the compromise, but
agreed with Senate Democratic leader George Mitchell of Maine, who
said ``Now comes the hard part,'' in pushing it past special
interest groups and through Congress.
   Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the No. 2 House Republican and a
leader of the party's conservative wing, left the White House
before the Rose Garden announcement of the deal, not yet ready to
support the package. ``We're still looking at it,'' he told
reporters later. ``I'm still thinking.''
   At the other end of the political spectrum, Rep. Charles Rangel,
D-N.Y., said he would oppose the package because ``it looks like a
tax on people who are hurting the most'' and Rep. Nick Joe Rahall,
D-W.Va., said, ``I don't think it goes far enough in getting the
wealthy to pay their fair share.''
   Ron Pollack, executive of Families USA, a non-profit group that
advocates on behalf of the elderly poor said the negotiators ``have
declared war on our grandparents'' and warned that those who back
the plan ``shouldn't expect older Americans to be pacifists on
Election Day.''
   Edwin Rothschild, head of Citizen Action, a non-profit national
consumer organization, complained that the gasoline tax is a
regressive measure that will hit poor and middle-income people
hardest. ``With gasoline and heating oil and other energy prices
going through the roof, it is absolutely the wrong time for
Congress and the president to be sticking the cost of the S&amp;L
bailout and other crisis on the average citizen,'' said Rothschild.
   The compromise would shear $40 billion off the deficit expected
for the new fiscal year. Without action, the 1991 shortfall was
projected to hit $294 billion, $73 billion higher than the previous
federal record for red ink and almost triple the shortfall the
administration said it anticipated in January.
   White House budget director Richard Darman attributed the higher
deficit projection to the deteriorating economy and growing
projections of the costs of rescuing the savings and loan industry.
   The agreement would waive the current deficit targets of the
Gramm-Rudman law, which would have required the new fiscal year's
budget gap to not exceed $74 billion.
   With congressional leaders at his side, Bush said ``I do not
welcome'' the tax increases - which he opposed during his 1988
election campaign. But he said they were needed to help the
country's economy, and he said he would join in a bipartisan effort
to get the package enacted by Oct. 19.
   ``I will do everything I can to generate support from the
American people for this compromise,'' he said.
   The components of the final budget compromise was a delicate
political balance between tax increases Democrats sought and
spending cuts Republicans favored.
   ``We all made compromises in the national interest,'' said House
Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.
   Republicans in Congress will be reluctant to accept the tax
increases, while many Democrats will look warily at domestic
spending reductions, with most programs held to increases matching
the inflation rate for the next three years. There also were broad
reductions in projected future spending for social, pension and
agricultural programs.
   The toughest cuts would affect the military - $10 billion in the
new year and up to $182 billion over five years.
   Among the tax measures was a gradual boost in gasoline taxes
from its current 9 cents per gallon to 21 cents - a 12-cent boost
that includes a two-cent per gallon tax applied to all petroleum
fuels, except heating oil.
   Cigarette taxes, now 16 cents a pack, will go up 8 cents more by
1993. The 3-cent-per-bottle wine tax will increase to 24 cents; the
16-cent tax on a six-pack of beer will go to 36 cents; and the
$12.50 per gallon tax on hard liquor will grow by $1.20.
   Luxury items such as fancy cars and jewelry will have a new 10
percent tax. And taxpayers who earn more than $100,000 annually -
either as individuals or couples - will have their deductions
reduced by 3 percent.
   But the package has tax breaks too, which Republicans argued
were needed to help the economy. Companies that explore for gas and
oil, conduct research or do business in depressed urban and rural
areas will qualify for tax advantages.
   The elderly and disabled, who now pay $28.60 per month for
Medicare coverage of doctors' expenses, would see that premium
increase to about $34.30. The $75 cap on doctors' costs Medicare
recipients must pay each year will be boosted to $150.
   Overall, half the savings in benefit programs - $60 billion -
would come from Medicare, split evenly between recipients and
providers, such as doctors and hospitals.
   In addition, upper income taxpayers will pay more to support the
Medicare program. The government now takes 1.45 percent from
paychecks to finance Medicare up to an annual limit of $51,300.
That ceiling will be increased to $73,000, an official said.
   Farm support programs would be cut $13 billion over five years.
Changes in the way payments are made to civil service retirees and
postal workers would save $12 billion.
   Overall, Bush said $134 billion of the savings would come from
newtaxes and fees; $182 billion from defense and domestic cuts and
$120 billion from reductions in benefit programs like Medicare. The
rest would come from reduced debt payments.
   ``This will be seen as sufficient pain, I think,'' Foley said.
   Negotiators completed their work early Sunday afternoon after
Bush returned briefly from a busy work day at the United Nations in
New York.
   In one of the final battles, Bush abandoned his effort to win a
reduction in the capital gains tax rate. In the end, the proposal
never made it into the final package - but neither did higher
income-tax rates on the wealthy that Democrats had demanded in
return.
   The two sides also agreed to drop another idea that made
Democrats and Republicans alike nervous: exacting savings from the
nation's 33 million Social Security recipients. Proposals to
increase taxes on Social Security benefits or to restrain the
growth of those benefits both fell victim to both parties' fears of
angry - and well-organized - elderly voters.
   With no agreement, federal spending would have automatically
been slashed by $85 billion Monday, enough to force many of the
government's 2.1 million civilian workers to face unpaid days off
and the public to deal with curtailed services. The furloughs would
have included air traffic controllers, workers who process Social
Security checks and FBI agents.
