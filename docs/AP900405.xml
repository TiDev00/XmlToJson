<HEAD>Dissipating Slick Moves Into West Virginia, Ohio</HEAD>

   A fragmented, 20-mile-long fuel slick
drifted Wednesday past steel plants and boat marinas on the Ohio
River into Ohio and West Virginia, where officials said it posed
less of a threat to drinking water.
   `It does appear to be dissipating,'' said Dave Plank, chief of
technical services for the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Resources. ``As the oil moves down the river, it will pose less of
a risk.''
   The slick's leading edge, moving about 1 mph, was near East
Liverpool, Ohio, on Wednesday afternoon, said department
spokeswoman Betsy Mallison.
   At least 75,000 gallons of diesel fuel, gasoline and kerosene
poured from a severed interstate pipeline into an Allegheny River
tributary Friday following a mudslide near Freeport 35 miles
northeast of Pittsburgh. The Allegheny flows into the Ohio River at
Pittsburgh.
   Earlier this week, the spill threatened the water supplies of as
many as 1 million people along the Allegheny and Ohio rivers.
   Early Wednesday, it passed the Beaver County community of
Midland, five miles east of the Ohio-West Virginia line.
   The Midland Water Authority, which serves 11,700 residents in
Midland, Ohioville and Industry, reopened its filter plant's intake
valves at 2 p.m. at about half normal pumping volume, said chief
operator Dan Zuppe. The valves were opened after state
environmental officials tested the water for oil.
   ``The spill has pretty much passed us by,'' Zuppe said Wednesday
evening. ``We're under the direction of the DER and they will give
us the direction when to go back on full.''
   Weirton, about 65 river miles south of Pittsburgh, was the first
West Virginia town whose water supply was threatened by the spill.
   Ken Capozzoli, a maintenance operator at the Weirton Water
Treatment Plant, said the authority would close its intakes and
rely on well water until the spill passed.
   ``We don't really know how long the wells can supply us, but
we'll do fine for the couple of days it should take for the spill
to pass,'' he said.
   At East Liverpool, the first Ohio community on the river south
of the spill, two intake valves near the river's surface were
closed as a precaution, said Glenn Woodward, water superintendent
for the city of 7,000 residents.
   Intakes deeper in the river continued to draw water Wednesday
afternoon because no oil had been detected that deep, according to
Woodward.
   ``We are anticipating it could hit anytime,'' he said.
   In Midland, a voluntary water conservation measure was in effect.
   The spill was no threat to other water systems serving Beaver
County because they depend on well water, said county Emergency
Management Agency Director Russell Chiodo.
   Several manufacturing plants _ including a steel plant in
Midland, a tin mill in Aliquippa and the Beaver Valley I and II
nuclear power plants _ continued drawing water directly from the
Ohio for industrial use, Chiodo said.
   In Pittsburgh, where small traces of petroleum were detected in
river water, Mayor Sophie Masloff lifted her call for water
conservation. And, water authorities along the Allegheny River that
had been affected by the spill were back in operation.
   Water conservation measures in some of those communities,
however, remained in effect.
   In Harrison Township, the only community where the taps ran dry,
about 20,000 residents were told to boil water to kill bacteria
that might have grown in the system when it was empty.

<HEAD>Catholic Bishops Hire Public Relations and Polling Firms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's Roman Catholic bishops on Thursday
announced that they have hired a major public relations firm and a
polling concern for a nationwide campaign to persuade Catholics and
non-Catholics to oppose abortion.
   The bishops are expected to spend as much as $5 million over
three to five years on the effort, The New York Times said in
Friday editions.
   ``Given the stakes _ life itself _ we can do no less,'' said
Cardinal John O'Connor, Archbishop of New York, who made the
announcement as chairman of the bishops' Committee for Pro-Life
Activities.
   The firms chosen, Hill &amp; Knowlton and the Wirthlin Group,
represent two of the nation's best known and most influential
political and lobbying strategists.
   The Wirthlin Group is a leading Republican polling operation
that served Ronald Reagan during his campaign for and time in the
White House.
   John Berard, deputy general manager of Hill &amp; Knowlton's
Washington office, said the campaign would involve neither lobbying
nor electoral politics. He said it was unclear whether it would
include advertising.
   ``We are focusing our efforts on a broad-based public education
and information campaign to make the bishops better heard on
abortion,'' he said.
   O'Connor said in his statement, ``We want this effort to unfold
on peaceful grounds, without vitriol, as we work to encourage both
within and beyond our faith community serious considerations of
moral ends, means and achievable policy goals.''
   The Catholic bishops have hired media consultants for events
like Pope John Paul II's visit to the United States in 1987, but
never before on the abortion issue.
   O'Connor said money for the campaign would be raised from
private individuals or organizations and would not detract from
existing programs.

<HEAD>Poll: Fear of Unified Germany Lessening Among Americans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Support for the reunification of East and West
Germany is growing among Americans, with two out of three Americans
saying they do not fear a united Germany, according to a New York
Times-CBS News poll.
   However, the poll published in Friday editions of the Times
indicated that Americans are concerned about the economic might of
a united Germany; nearly four out of 10 Americans worried that
Germany would dominate the European economy.
   Forty-nine percent of those surveyed said a united Germany would
not try to dominate Europe economically, while 36 percent believed
that it would.
   Asked about the future of Germany, 76 percent of those surveyed
said they favored unification, an increase of 6 percentage points
from a similar survey in November. A majority, 67 percent, said
they were not concerned that a united Germany would threaten peace,
while 22 percent said they were worried it would.
   The telephone poll of 1,515 adults between last Friday and
Monday also found strong support for economic aid to nations in
Eastern Europe and Latin American that are moving toward democracy.
   The Times said surveys since 1971 have indicated that Americans
generally opposed foreign aid by a 3-to-1 margin. But they now are
about evenly split on giving aid to Eastern Europe and Latin
America, the newspaper said.
   A majority of Americans, 51 percent, said the number of U.S.
troops in Western Europe should be maintained or increased, while
29 percent said the military presence should be cut and only 10
percent said it should be eliminated.
   Regarding Lithuania and its efforts to break away from the
Soviet Union, 39 percent said they approved of the way President
Bush is handling the crisis, while 19 percent said they disapproved.
   Forty-one percent took the president's view that maintaining
good relations with the Soviet Union was more important than
Lithuania's efforts to form its own nation.
   The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage
points.

   Researchers today reported an advance toward
finding the defective gene or genes responsible for spinal muscular
atrophy, a disabling and sometimes lethal disease of children.
   They narrowed down the search to a particular part of one
chromosome, one of the 23 pairs of threadlike structures on which
genes reside.
   Finding the gene or genes responsible for the disease may give
clues for developing treatments, researchers said.
   No firm numbers exist on how many people have the disease, which
weakens muscles by attacking nerves that control voluntary muscles.
The study included three forms of the disease that strike a total
of about one in 10,000 newborns, said study co-author T. Conrad
Gilliam.
   The acute form, the most common, appears at birth or in infancy
and usually kills by age 4. Two chronic forms usually appear in
early childhood with effects ranging from relatively mild muscle
weakness to profound weakness and death in early adolescence.
   Ashley Antolak, the 6-year-old national poster child for the
Muscular Dystrophy Association, has a chronic form of spinal
muscular atrophy.
   The new study found evidence that a defective gene or genes
causing the chronic forms is on chromosome number 5. It also
suggests that the acute form may come from the same source or a
nearby gene, said study co-author Linda Brzustowicz.
   Brzustowicz, Gilliam and others at Columbia University and the
New York State Psychiatric Institute did the work with Theodore
Munsat of Tufts University and the New England Medical Center in
Boston, and others at the University of Utah Medical Center in Salt
Lake City, Odyssey Biomedical Corp. in West Paterson, N.J., and
scientists in Britain, West Germany and Poland.
   The work is reported in today's issue of the British journal
Nature.
   It marks ``a very important first step'' toward developing
treatments and preventing the disease through prenatal diagnosis
and detection of people at risk for having affected children,
genetics expert Robert Williamson of London University in England
commented Wednesday.

<HEAD>Seduction and Sweet Surrender: Remembering Sarah Vaughan</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Thursday AMs report.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Never mind the trifling banter or the continual
references to the buckets of sweat that cascaded down her ample
frame.
   None of that mattered when Sarah Vaughan seized the stage and
seduced a willing audience with the moody excitement of her jazz
stylings.
   It was always sweet surrender.
   She caressed a song with all the colorings of her voice,
sometimes teasing with the weighty depths of low D, sometimes more
direct with her pure C. Sometimes playful with inspired scat,
sometimes sentimental with soft singing from her soul.
   Who could resist such a temptress?
   For those who knew and worked with Sarah Vaughan, who died
Tuesday night at age 66, few could.
   ``I traveled around the world with her and she'd be sold out,
and people wouldn't even understand the language she was singing
in,'' recalled drummer Harold Jones, who worked with Vaughan for a
decade and had been friends with the song stylist for 25 years.
   ``Sometimes I'd go up to them later and ask them why they came
to the concert if they couldn't understand her, why they thought
she was so great. They would say, `it was the feeling, the feeling
of the way she sang.' That's how they knew she was great.''
   She sang of love and life. Easy, breezy tunes such as ``East of
the Sun.'' Moody, bluesy ballads like ``Easy Living'' and ``The Man
I Love.'' Complicated jazz songs that ended in rollicking scat _
``Fascinatin' Rhythm,'' ``I Remember April.''
   And along the way, she always had fun.
   Once, at a Carnegie Hall concert in 1980, she performed Duke
Ellington's ``Sophisticated Lady,'' and confessed to a startled
audience that she didn't know the lyrics so she'd have to refer to
the sheet music.
   ``I've never done it until now,'' she said with a laugh. ``This
could be my first and last time _ it's not an easy song to sing. If
you hear me falter _ HELP.''
   She didn't. She never did. Or, if she did, no one noticed. Or no
one cared.
   ``She was always an absolute nervous wreck before performing,''
recalled Andy Simkins, Vaughan's bassist. ``There's a certain edge
you need to perform. But she would be a wreck. She was fine after
she went on stage, or after she started the first set at a club.
   ``She was always a little girl. I always thought of her as a
little sister. There was a certain naivete and, then again, she was
old professional show business and had stories for days. Billy
Eckstine was really her mentor. When she was depressed and nobody
could get to her, she'd call for B. He was the only one who could
get to her.''
   Vaughan worked with Eckstine in his own band after they both
left Earl Hines in 1944. Together, they ignited romance with lovely
duets on jazz standards. Alone, they both produced a litany of hit
romantic records.
   She and Eckstine reunited a few years back at the Kool Jazz
Festival in New York and reprised some of those love ballads. But
time had robbed them of memory, and both whipped out their glasses
to glance at an occasional lyric for ``Passing Strangers,'' a song
popular in England in the 1940s.
   ``They had known each other so long, they didn't even have to
rehearse,'' said jazz producer George Wein. ``It was the warmth of
love that those two had for each other, so the lyrics didn't mean
anything. It was the music.''
   As a soloist Vaughan eventually ran into George Shearing, then a
young jazz pianist who had emigrated to the United States from
Britain in 1947. She was the first vocalist with whom he worked.
   ``Jimmy Jones, the pianist, had a trick whereby he would stab at
a chord and then hit the sustaining pedal before the vibrations
were gone and instead of getting BAAHHH, he'd get BINK,'' Shearing
recalled in an interview. ``It was a wonderful trick, and he and
Sarah would do that to `Tenderly.' He did that prior to the last
note, and then she'd do some vocals that were just incredible.
   ``She could hold on to great, big long notes without vibrato.''
   Vaughan took that great gift and used it for popular music when
she recorded ``Brokenhearted Melody'' in 1958, and later with such
middle-of-the-road tunes as ``Send in the Clowns.'' The switch
generated new converts for her, but saddened jazz purists.
   ``I don't really feel she switched over,'' said Harold Jones.
``She went in and did them and then back on the gig, she was still
singing `Lush Life' and `Tenderly.'''
   Simkins wasn't bothered with pop sidesteps either. ``I learned a
lot from her,'' he said. ``She probably taught me how to play a
ballad on my instrument. ... She was always my image as to how a
love song or ballad should be played.''
   Vaughan never thought of herself as a pop singer or a jazz
singer, or even a great singer. And as popular as she was, Jones
said, she never thought of herself as having a hit song.
   ``To me, she was the greatest,'' Simkins said. ``What I loved
was she never thought of herself as Sarah Vaughan and her trio. She
always thought of herself as a quartet.''
   A powerful and pleasing instrument that gave pleasure to
generations.

<TEXT>
   About the time Nelson Mandela went to
jail 27 years ago, Lenford Ganyile fled South Africa after a
violent encounter that cost him all his teeth and most of an ear.
   A South African policeman's rifle butt knocked out his teeth,
Ganyile said, and a bayonet sliced off the ear.
   Ganyile, 68, has been in exile since, first in Botswana and then
in Zambia, where Mandela's African National Congress set up its
headquarters. In February, President F.W. de Klerk of South Africa
legalized the ANC and freed Mandela.
   ``I am waiting for Comrade Mandela to tell me what to do next,''
said Ganyile, a respected elder on the ANC's 7,200-acre Chongela
collective farm in Zambia's fertile Ngwerere district, 25 miles
north of Lusaka.
   Although he is eager to go home, Ganyile has difficulty
remembering the wife and three children he left behind.
   ``In the early years, I sent them letters but had no reply,'' he
said. ``I was afraid they would get into trouble, so I stopped
writing.''
   Occasionally, he heard news of his wife from newly arrived
exiles. Then he lost all contact.
   ``The struggle became my family,'' Ganyile said. ``I saw my ear
was not there and it reminded me always that I wanted all our
people to be free.''
   He is one of thousands of South African exiles scattered through
the world whose lives were transformed by the lifting of a 30-year
ban on the African National Congress and Mandela's release Feb. 12.
The ANC has said most of its exiles probably would be home by the
end of 1990.
   ``It is a dream to me,'' said Ganyile, a veteran of the Pondo
rebellion of the late 1950s, when scores of blacks were killed in
riots against South Africa's official apartheid policy of race
segregation.
   Ganyile, who spent 20 months in jail, said he was arrested for
leading ANC protesters in the Pondoland region near Mandela's home
in Transkei.
   ``We were fighting one of the worst devils on earth, the Bantu
Authorities Act'' and its discriminatory laws, he said.
   After fleeing South Africa, Ganyile used his farming experience
to teach other exiles. He is on the Chongela farm's management
committee.
   Farm manager Leslie Ponusamy said the property, three adjoining
farms owned by whites before independence from Britain in 1964,
feeds about three-quarters of the 2,000 ANC members who live in
Zambia.
   Vegetables and maize grow on the farm, and the residents raise
cattle, sheep, pigs and ducks.
   ``We don't produce everything for a balanced diet,'' said
Ponusamy, a veterinarian who was a student activist in South
Africa's Natal province. ``We sell the surplus of one thing to buy
other things we need.''
   Young exiles are sent by ANC headquarters in Lusaka to learn
practical skills on the farm. Foreign donations help finance a
dairy, slaughterhouse, several workshops and an auto repair shop.
   ``Most of our young people interrupted their educations when
they left South Africa,'' Ponusamy said.
   Dan Twala, 22, said he fled after being assaulted by police in
1987, during a disturbance in a black township.
   ``I came to join the struggle,'' he said. ``Now all I want to do
is to go back to see the family.''
   What will happen to the farm when everyone returns home?
   ``Perhaps we will give it to the Zambian government,'' Ponusamy
said. ``When we no longer need it, we will leave it as a momument,
some sort of remembrance, to our struggle.''

<HEAD>Report: Feds Say War On Drugs Failed In Capitol</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bush Administration officials say the year-old,
``test-case'' battle against drugs in the nation's capitol has
failed, The New York Times reported.
   Their conclusions were expected to be part of a report on the
program to be released this month by William J. Bennett, the
national drug policy adviser, the Times said in Thursday editions.
   The Times quoted unidentified federal officials as saying that
Washington has failed to demonstrate a commitment to control drug
abuse.
   Unidentified city officials in turn, blamed Bennett, saying he
oversold the program and failed to back up his promises with
federal funds.
   In January, the city's mayor, Marion S. Barry, was arrested on
cocaine charges.
   Both city and federal officials agreed that illegal drugs remain
relatively cheap and plentiful and that there has been no reduction
in drug-related murders, the Times said.
   The administration originally promised to direct an extra $100
million to drug programs in the city, much of which was supposed to
go for jail space. But the money has gone unspent because the city
has been unable to agree on a plan for jail construction, the Times
said.
   The Federal government also has had military prosecutors assist
in federal drug cases, has offered money for new drug treatment
centers and created a team of federal agents led by the Drug
Enforcement Administration that has made scores of arrests and
seized millions of dollars in assets from drug dealers, the Times
said.
   Bennett spokesman Don Hamilton, asked Wednesday night whether
the report said the drug effort in Washington had failed, said: ``I
don't think that's quite so.
   ``I don't think we're going to say everything in D.C. is
hunky-dory and we should get a ride down Pennsylvania Avenue on
rose petals, but the report's not done yet,'' Hamilton said.
   He said Bennett's staff planned to meet Thursday morning to
discuss what would be in the report, which he said would be issued
next week.
   In October, Bennett said the drug problem in the capital had
gotten worse in the first six months of the drug war.
   ``We picked a difficult task last April, and I never had any
illusions about the challenges that lay before us,'' he said at the
time.

   The call, on a marine hailing frequency, was
urgent and chilling: A ship somewhere on the freezing waters off
Massachusetts was transmitting a last-ditch plea for help.
   ``This is the fishing vessel Sol E Mar,'' a male voice shouted
in frenzy. ``We're sinkin'. We need help now!''
   The plea rose into a scream. The transmission was abruptly cut.
Then, there was only crackling static.
   Coast Guard radio monitors on Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard
tried desperately to get the caller back to locate the ship and
send help.
   But just over a minute after the first call, another distress
signal came in.
   ``SOS, I'm sinking,'' a male voice said. And then he laughed.
   The Coast Guard officers didn't dispatch rescue planes or boats.
The calls, they thought, were just part of the rising number of
hoaxes.
   Last Friday, five days later, they discovered they were wrong.
The Sol E Mar was reported missing and the Coast Guard began a
search for the father and son who manned the 50-foot fishing vessel.
   By then, it was too late.
   The Sol E Mar and the two men were presumed lost at sea
somewhere south of Martha's Vineyard. The search was called off
Sunday night.
   The family grieved, fishermen along the New England coast
mourned the loss of more of their own, and the Coast Guard was left
wondering how to deal with hoaxers who think they are being clever
by faking a call for help.
   ``Things might have been different,'' said Lt. Paul Wolf, the
Coast Guard spokesman in Boston. ``I can't say the fake call killed
them. But it certainly lessened their chances.''
   Bogus distress calls were once just a nuisance to Coast Guard
rescuers. Now they are considered a serious problem.
   ``This is the first case that I know of where it was a factor in
a rescue,'' Wolf said. ``It definitely influenced the way we
responded.''
   In 1989, 16 hoaxes were recorded on the coast from Canada to New
Jersey, and the Coast Guard responded to most of the calls, said
Coast Guard Cmdr. Bill Armstrong.
   This year, there already have been 11 known hoaxes.
   ``We have limited resources, and every time we respond to a
hoax, those resources aren't there for someone who may need them,''
Armstrong said.
   In 1986, a man was sentenced to a year in prison after he
broadcast a bogus distress signal that triggered a massive
sea-and-air search for a sinking yacht with 10 people aboard.
   Emergency responses often are hampered because of the constant
chatter on radios, largely by inexperienced boaters. The problem is
so acute in the Boston area, with its endless stream of seafaring
radio traffic, that the Coast Guard and the Federal Communications
Commission will experiment with an additional distress frequency
beginning next year, Armstrong said.
   Lost with the Sol E Mar were William Hokanson Sr., 44, and his
19-year-old son, William Jr. The two Fairhaven men set out March 22
from Kelley's Landing for Cape Cod, hoping for a large flounder
catch.
   Manuel Aguiar, William Sr.'s brother-in-law, said he had heard
the Coast Guard tapes. He said the first call was clearly from the
son, and the second was a different voice. He said the family was
angry at the Coast Guard.
   ``They're out there to serve the public, fake call or not,'' he
said.
   Fighting back tears, Aguiar described William Sr. as ``one of
the best men in the world. He would give you anything he had.''
   William Jr. was a hockey star and a good student who loved
fishing as much as his father, Aguiar said. William Sr. had been
fishing for 20 years, and his son started joining him at age 6, he
said.
   ``They were very close,'' Aguiar said. ``William Senior would
never have let anything happen to his kid.''
   It was the second loss at sea for the Hokanson family of
fishermen. In 1952, William Sr.'s father, Fritz, was lost off
Nantucket on the fishing vessel Paolina.
   At the Seamen's Bethel in New Bedford, marble cenotaphs honor
lost seafarers, from the whalers of the 1800s to present-day
fishermen.
   ``Fritz Hokanson is remembered here,'' said Director Adolph
Allerdt. ``Now, his son and grandson will be, too.''
   Wolf said the Coast Guard was reviewing its actions. More
detailed instructions on how to distinguish hoaxes from authentic
calls are being sent to radio monitors with added urgency because
of the Sol E Mar sinking, he said.
   Even if the fake call had not come in, the Hokansons might never
have been rescued, since their boat apparently sank before they
could radio their location, Wolf said.
   ``If I could change anything, I would have given them five more
seconds on the radio,'' Wolf said.
   ``The Coast Guard saved 6,000 people last year,'' he added. ``I
just wish we could have rescued two more.''

   Radio broadcasters are increasingly worried that
Cuba will retaliate for the U.S. propaganda channel ``TV Marti,''
especially since a warning shot three weeks ago that was heard as
far away as Utah.
   Radio station operators and engineers at this week's National
Association of Broadcasters convention have done much talking about
TV Marti and, more specifically, about the threat that Cuba might
jam U.S. radio broadcasts in retaliation.
   It is widely believed that Cuba has radio transmitters capable
of 1 million watts or more, 20 times the strength of the strongest
U.S. AM stations.
   TV Marti is broadcast from a balloon high above the Florida
Keys, and is designed to beam a pro-democracy message into Castro's
Cuba.
   Cuba has been jamming the Voice of America broadcasts since they
started March 27 and Cuban President Fidel Castro warned Tuesday
that any U.S. attempt to interfere with the jamming could lead to
war.
   He told reporters in Havana that TV Marti was a ``gross
instrument of subversion.''
   The warning shot that has broadcasters worried came on March 23,
four days before testing of TV Marti began.
   Federal Communications Commission monitors heard Cuban radio
signals on six separate clear-channel frequencies on the U.S. AM
radio dial, said Walter W. Wurfel, senior vice president of the NAB.
   Half a dozen AM stations in Florida battled with the
interference, and stations in Red Springs, N.C., and Donelson,
Tenn., filed complaints, Wurfel said.
   The interference even turned up in Salt Lake City, said John
Dehnel, chief engineer at that Utah city's clear-channel KSL-AM.
   ``It was definitely there, no question about it,'' Dehnel said.
``And we believe it was not their highest-powered transmitter.''
   ``Castro delivered his message,'' said Patrick Roberts,
president of the Florida Association of Broadcasters.
   ``If Castro fires up his AM radio transmitters, it poses a
substantial potential to interrupt and cause interference to a lot
of radio stations in the United States _ perhaps 1,000 to 1,500,''
Wurfel said.
   Broadcasters at an NAB seminar on TV Marti heard an example of
apparent Cuban jamming, taken from KSL; it blended the Mormon
Tabernacle Choir with the unmistakable sounds of mariachi music.
   President Bush asked the broadcasters Monday to ``stand for
freedom'' and support TV Marti. But NAB President Edward Fritts
said his group remains concerned about TV Marti interference and
Cuban retaliation. He also complained that the administration
refuses to allow broadcasters any input in the TV Marti testing.
   ``I have an AM station in Tampa that has been interfered with
since Radio Marti began'' in the mid-1980s, said Michael Osterhout,
president of Edens Broadcasting, which operates WRBQ-AM. ``We've
had some minor interference at night.
   ``I just don't believe this is a feasible way to get programming
into Cuba. ... The system doesn't seem to work.''
   ``We're somewhat opposed to TV Marti,'' said Thomas L. Goodgame
of Westinghouse Broadcasting, chairman of the NAB's Television
Board. The $22 million effort may not work anyway, and if the
Cubans jam U.S. radio broadcasts, ``it's definitely not worth it,''
he said.
   So far, it appears that Cuba has left U.S. AM radio alone since
the events of March 23. ``We are not aware of any specific, new
interference to American AM broadcasters by Castro since the (TV
Marti) tests began,'' Wurfel said.
   Broadcasters also fear that the TV Marti transmissions might
bleed over and disrupt Florida TV stations _ chiefly in Tampa,
where a station already broadcasts on channel 13, the same used by
TV Marti, Wurfel said.

<HEAD>Quartet of Democrats Jockeying for Shot at Helms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENNIS PATTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Undaunted by shortages in money and name
recognition, four eager North Carolina Democrats are jockeying for
a shot at toppling conservative Republican Sen. Jesse Helms in
November.
   With the primary election just a month away, voters so far have
been spared the rough-and-tumble politicking that early on
characterized the 1984 race between Helms and his Democratic
challenger, then-Gov. Jim Hunt.
   This time around, all four Democratic challengers have been
campaigning across the state to expand their appeal, but none has
broken out of his regional base and into the lead.
   ``None of the Democratic candidates have the widespread name
recognition of a Jim Hunt, but as we get closer to the primary, I
think that will resolve itself,'' said state Democratic Party
Chairman Lawrence Davis.
   ``It's been an incredibly different campaign from 1984,'' said
Carter Wrenn of the National Congressional Club, Helms' political
organization.
   In that year, neither Helms nor Hunt had a serious primary
challenger, so both candidates began gunning for one another early,
spending a national record $26 million on a race marked by negative
campaigning and personal slurs.
   The main challengers in this year's May 8 Democratic primary are:
   _Former Charlotte Mayor Harvey Gantt, who is seeking to become
the first black to win a statewide race in North Carolina. Gantt's
supporters say a solid black vote, combined with his proven ability
to attract white voters in his mayoral races, could help him garner
40 percent of the Democratic vote and avoid a runoff.
   _Southport prosecutor Mike Easley, who has developed a
reputation as a drug fighter in a region whose coastal areas have
been used by smugglers since pirate days. Easley has the support of
many party activists who were involved in Hunt's campaigns and has
campaigned on themes such as day care and the environment that are
likely to attract baby boomers.
   _R.P. ``Bo'' Thomas, a produce broker who served nine years in
the state Senate. Thomas has campaigned on a strong populist
message that he says can win back ``Jessecrats'' _ conservative
white Democrats who routinely vote for Helms.
   _Former Insurance Commissioner John Ingram, whose major campaign
theme has been a plan to force insurance companies to finance a
high-risk pool to make affordable health insurance available to
almost everyone.
   Early polls show Helms ahead of all four potential challengers,
a reversal from 1984 when similar surveys had Hunt in the lead. By
the November election, however, Helms had hacked away at Hunt's
support to take 52 percent of the vote.
   Helms' 43 percent approval rating also is higher now than in
1984, Wrenn said.
   While the noise of the campaign hasn't been as loud as in 1984,
both sides say the equation for victory remains the same. Helms
starts out with 40 to 45 percent of the vote and his eventual
Democratic opponent can count on roughly the same amount.
   ``You have people who are yellow-dog Democrats who will always
vote against Helms because he's a Republican,'' said Thad Beyle, a
political science professor at the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill. ``And then there are others who will always vote
against Helms because of his views.''
   Wrenn said the outcome depends on the 10 percent to 20 percent
of the electorate identified as swing voters, most of whom are
registered as Democrats.
   ``They have to get all of their votes and a third of ours to
win,'' Democratic chairman Davis said of the Republicans. ``That's
the same equation we've had for the last several years.''
   Beyle said Helms' tactic for reaching those voters, judging from
his last campaign, is he ``gets hold of some issue well before the
campaign and beats it to death.''
   ``In 1984, it was the Martin Luther King holiday bill,'' Beyle
said. ``In 1990, it's the National Endowment for the Arts,'' which
Helms has criticized for supporting art he considers obscene.
   Wrenn attributes Helms' strength in the early polls to two
factors: ``One, we're not running against Jim Hunt, a very popular
governor. And two, all the Democratic candidates' positions are
left of center, and pretty extremely left of center.''
   Beyle said Helms may be starting out stronger this time because
he is not yet facing an identified opponent. ``Right now, he's
running against X candidate,'' Beyle said.

<HEAD>Nikolais Soars With `Space Fantasy' For Kids</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Modern dance pioneer Alwin Nikolais is
accustomed to worldwide acclaim, but he confesses he was terrified
by the squirming second-graders who attended the world premiere of
his new ``space fantasy'' for children.
   ``Children frighten me,'' said Nikolais, a 79-year-old bachelor.
``You never can know what their reaction might be, unless you're
around them a lot. I'm not around children very much, so it was
doubly terrifying.''
   Nikolais needn't have worried.
   Moments after the curtain rose Tuesday on ``The Crystal and the
Sphere,'' his stage voyage through the galaxy of a child's
imagination, Nikolais clearly had won the hearts of 500 local
school children who packed the Kennedy Center's Terrace Theater.
   The kids squealed as the house lights dimmed and the rumble of
thunder shook their seats. They oohed and aahed as the rising
curtain revealed a 20-foot balloon rocking gently on the stage,
like a strange new planet, and a 12-foot shard of crystal bathed in
celestial lights.
   They giggled at the wondrous aliens that cavorted across the
stage _ a mermaid who teasingly tied her kelp tresses to an
angler's hook, a pair of fat, web-footed birds that splashed in
musical mud puddles, herky-jerky androids ablaze in ultraviolet
hues who disappeared in the twinkling of an eye.
   Nikolais did it all _ choreography, synthesizer musical score,
scenery and costumes _ in creating the $20,000 centerpiece for this
year's ``Imagination Celebration,'' the Kennedy Center's annual
arts festival for children.
   His new work, performed by five hand-picked dancers from New
York, is being presented nine times this week at the Kennedy Center
before it travels to children's festivals at the El Centro Theater
in Dallas, April 18-20, and the Orange County Performing Arts
Center in Costa Mesa, Calif., April 25-26.
   ``The first show is a terror,'' said Nikolais, sighing happily
after the curtain fell on his latest premiere.
   He hadn't created a dance work for youngsters since he was
director of the Henry Street Playhouse in New York in the late
1940s, when his company staged a dozen popular ``dance plays'' for
children.
   Since then, he has been cheered by audiences and critics around
the world _ and received the coveted National Medal of Arts from
President Reagan in 1987 _ as a modern dance visionary. In a way,
Nikolais said, his work on ``The Crystal and the Sphere'' meant
returning to the world of children after a 40-year absence.
   ``They haven't changed,'' he said. ``They're made the same way
and they behave the same way. It's that I'm rediscovering them
again.''
   Nikolais tried to envision the unearthly creatures a child might
encounter on an imaginary exploration of the planets.
   ``Like most artists, I have a childlike mind with a certain
innocence that allows me to do things that others don't dare to
do,'' he said.
   ``I do know that children love color, and they like motions that
they don't see all the time. I thought they'd like these curious,
angular body shapes, and dancers who suddenly appeared and
disappeared.
   ``Children also like strange sounds. You don't hear them humming
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. They like the big bang, like the
world's coming to an end. And what really scares them is the lights
going out, and being left in the dark. That always makes them
yelp.''
   Nikolais' vision scored a hit with at least one member of the
audience Tuesday.
   When the lights went up after the 45-minute show, a little girl
turned to a schoolmate and asked, ``It's over already?''

<HEAD>The Times' Letters Editor Reflects on 11 Years at the Mailbag</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Thursday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   This is not a great age of correspondence, says
the recently retired editor of The Times' venerable letters column,
though the mailbags still bulge with opinions both profound and
eccentric.
   ``There are many people who simply do not know how to put words
onto paper; they have to become so used to talking on the telephone
or dictating into machines and having them tidied up by their
secretaries,'' Leon Pilpel said in an interview published in
Wednesday's editions of The Times.
   ``Of the 300 letters a day, only about 8 percent are
publishable. I am not talking about matters of syntax, but about
importance, or meetness.
   ``Many of them are pretty mundane, although frequently half a
dozen not very brilliant ones can be made into a very good
correspondence indeed _ with a bit of judicious editing, and the
specific approval of the letter-writer.''
   Great debates have been waged in the sober letters columns of
The Times, leavened with whimsical bits of English life, such as
the sighting of the first cuckoo of spring.
   Pilpel, who is taking up new duties as a deputy ombudsman at the
paper, joined The Times 40 years ago and became letters editor in
1979.
   The best letters during his tenure, Pilpel said, came during the
Falklands war with Argentina in 1982, when former ambassadors and
high-level bureaucrats were moved to pick up their pens.
   The letters columns, he said, have declined in influence.
   ``The amount of information, and the diversity of viewpoints
made available to the public from every medium, chiefly radio and
television with all their discussion programs, mean that in some
ways we are just part of a more widely disseminated form of
argument,'' he said.
   Wednesday's four columns of letters were typically diverse,
running the gamut from Soviet policy in Lithuania and the late
Bruno Bettleheim's theories about the docility of prisoners in Nazi
death camps, to a letter from Nina E.C. Coltart of 1a Well Road
boasting of next-day delivery of a first-class letter addressed
``Won, Eh? Well Rowed!''
   Graham Chainey wrote from Cambridge to summarize his researches
on letters to the Times regarding the Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race,
which was rowed last weekend and won by Oxford.
   ``In January of this year I calculate that you published no
fewer than 15 letters from Cambridge addresses against a miserable
four from Oxford,'' Chainey wrote.
   ``This lead was magnificently maintained in February with a
further 16 from Cambridge against three from Oxford. Only in March
did the balance inexplicably swing the other way, with Oxford
scoring seven published letters against five from Cambridge.''
   The final tally, he determined, was Cambridge 36, Oxford 14. ``I
do not, of course, offer any explanation,'' Chainey said. In the
style of Times' correspondents, he signed off, ``yours faithfully.''

<HEAD>Two More Companies Suspected of Delivering Parts to Rabta Plant</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   BADEN-BADEN, West Germany (AP) _ Two more West German companies
are being investigated on suspicion of trying to deliver parts to
the Libyan plant allegedly involved in making poison gas, a
televison station reported.
   Suedwestfunk TV said Wednesday that prosecutors in the southern
city of Ulm have opened a probe of Abacaus GmbH in Ulm and Rose
GmbH in Stuttgart.
   Investigators searched the offices of the two companies last
week and seized documents, the report said. Agents also searched
the home of Abacus manager Wolfgang Liebert, the television station
said.
   The two companies are suspected of seeking to deliver parts to
Libya needed to complete the chemical plant in Rabta, the report
said. No actual deliveries are believed to have taken place, it
said.
   U.S. and West German officials said earlier this year that the
Rabta plant has produced limited amounts of poison gas. Libya
denied the reports, insisting the plant is designed to manufacture
only pharmaceuticals.
   A fire last month caused damage at the Rabta plant. The cause of
the fire is not clear, nor is the extent of the damage.
   U.S. allegations that West German companies helped Libya build
the plant caused a row between Bonn and Washington last year. The
West German government at first denied the allegations but later
ordered its own investigation.
   Imhausen-Chemie GmbH, a chemical company in the southern town of
Lahr, is suspected of delivering key equipment to the Rabta plant.
   Juergen Hippenstiel-Imhausen, the former chief of
Inhamusen-Chemie, was indicted last month on charges he played a
major role in supplying equipment to the Rabta factory. He was
arrested 11 months ago.
   The Suedwestfunk television report said the Abacus company
ordered equipment from a Siemens facility in Karlsruhe, saying the
order was on behalf of a Dutch company. The final destination of
the equipment was given by Abacus as Saudi Arabia, the report said.
   But authorities believe the equipment was really destined for
Libya, the report said.
   The equipment involved parts needed to complete a production
guidance system in Rabta, the report said. Some components of the
system are believed to have been delivered by Imhausen in 1987, it
added.

   Two men captured near the Swiss border in a
car filled with weapons and ammunition have been identified as
convicted members of the Red Brigades terrorist gang.
   Officials said they were probably preparing a major armed
robbery, but had no other immediate details.
   Police identified the two as Enzo Fontana, 38, who was sentenced
to 26 years in prison for killing a highway patrolman in 1977, and
Giorgio Giudici, 40, who had served out an eight-term term for
armed robbery.
   The two were arrested Tuesday by police, who, according to press
reports, also uncovered a hideout filled with arms and explosives.
   Four other people suspected as accomplices escaped.
   Officials said they were investigating possible links to arms
dealings in Switzerland. Giudici worked as a driver for a firm in
Roveredo, in the Swiss canton of Ticino.
   Fontana was serving his term in semi-liberty, meaning he was
free during the day but had to return each evening to San Vittore
Prison in Milan.

<TEXT>
   Greyhound Lines Inc. on Wednesday offered free bus
trips through Easter to passengers delayed on Northeast routes in
an effort to recapture business lost in the region during a
monthlong drivers' strike.
   A suspicious fire broke out Wednesday night in Boston at a
garage at a Greyhound service terminal housing about 15 Trailways
buses, fire officials said. There were no injuries.
   Firefighters had to cut through a metal garage door to get to
the fire, and had a difficult time locating its source because the
300- by 150-foot garage was filled with smoke and heat, said Boston
Fire Chief Robert Dillon. The fire appeared to have been
concentrated in a single bus. Trailways is owned by Greyhound.
   In New York City, a state judge barred the company from hiring
``strikebreakers.'' Greyhound said it would appeal the ruling.
   Greyhound's 6,300 drivers and about 3,000 office and maintenance
workers walked off the job March 2 in a dispute over wages and job
security. The country's only nationwide bus company has operated on
a reduced schedule since then using permanent replacements and
union members who cross picket lines.
   The union Wednesday accused the company of allowing ``crazies''
and ``terrorists'' to block a resumption of talks. The company
called on the union to join in a news conference denouncing the
violence and to cut strike benefits for union members who
participate in attacks.
   Greyhound has said it will not bargain with the union until
seven days have passed without shots being fired at one of its
buses or facilities.
   Union spokesman Nick Nichols said the condition makes no sense.
   ``They basically turned this whole process over to the people
they're calling the terrorists,'' Nichols said. ``There's no way,
in my view, that either the company or the union can control these
crazies.''
   Greyhound vice president P. Anthony Lannie said in a letter to
union president Edward Strait that ``absent implementation of
effective measures to curb the illegal conduct, the union cannot
disclaim responsibility.
   ``The union's conspicuous failure to implement effective
measures against the violence lead to the inevitable conclusion of
union responsibility for strike misconduct,'' he said.
   In New York, Judge Diane Lebedeff granted a union request for a
temporary restraining order based on an anti-strikebreaking statute
passed by New York's City Council in 1962, but never used.
   It prohibits a company for bringing in any workers ``for the
purpose of having such person take the place in employment of
employees in an industry or establishment where a strike or lockout
exists.''
   The judge said Greyhound's offer of a $2,000 bonus to drivers
hired during the strike ``tends to corroborate the charge that
strikebreakers are being used.''
   Greyhound spokesman George Gravley said the ruling wouldn't
affect the company much. ``It does not interfere with our basic
operations ... we don't hire strikebreakers,'' he said.
   Dallas-based Greyhound has been rebuilding its system since the
strike began, expanding mainly in the South and West.
   Last week, Company President Frank Schmieder said the walkout
was essentially meaningless in much of the country. However, he
acknowledged that the Northeast, which accounts for about 10
percent of Greyhound revenue, remained a trouble spot.
   Greyhound said Wednesday it was improving regional service by
adding hourly departures on Fridays and Sundays from New York City
to Boston, Philadelphia and Washington. It guaranteed seats would
be available and buses would run on-time.
   ``We promise to arrive within 15 minutes of the scheduled
arrival time,'' Schmieder said. ``If we don't we will give our
passengers a coupon good for a free round trip on the same route.''
   The guarantee covers Albany, Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse,
N.Y.; Boston; Montreal; Mount Laurel, N.J., Philadelphia; and
Washington, is good only through Easter Sunday, April 15, and must
be redeemed by June 15.
   Greyhound spokeswoman Elizabeth Hale said the company had
decided to focus attention on the Northeast because of the region's
level of commuter travel.
   Ms. Hale said 1.66 million people have taken Greyhound buses
since the strike began, with 61,437 traveling by bus on Tuesday, or
46.8 percent of those who traveled on the same day last year.
Percentages have been climbing slowly throughout the walkout.
   Greyhound has pledged not to resume negotiations with the
Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions until a week passes
without major violence.
   There have been 31 shootings, including 26 at buses, 70 bomb
threats and more than 100 other incidents of violence, Greyhound
officials say. The union says about 60 of its pickets have been
targets of violence. A striker in Redding, Calif., was crushed to
death March 3 by a bus being reversed by a replacement driver.
   Greyhound has offered a three-year contract it values at $63
million and says it can not afford to pay more. The union says its
own latest offer is worth about $40 million, but Greyhound says it
would cost $180 million.

   ``Putting out a newspaper without promotion is
like winking at a girl in the dark _ well-intentioned but
ineffective,'' said press mogul William Randolph Hearst.
   His quotation adorns an exhibit, ``The American Journalist:
Paradox of the Press.'' It opens today at the Library of Congress
and winks, in full self-consciousness, at the American press in
every manifestation from feisty Hearst to feisty Benjamin Harris,
America's first newsman.
   Harris published the first American newspaper on Sept. 25, 1690.
It lasted one issue before it was closed down by the British
authorities. The sole surviving copy was flown back from London for
the exhibit.
   The show, underwritten by a $325,000 grant from the Gannett
Foundation and running through Aug. 12, coincides with the 67th
annual meeting of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, whose
members gathered at the library Wednesday night to celebrate the
occasion.
   On display, behind glass: the little bedside notebook in which
Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward made notes when the city desk
awakened him on Saturday, June 17, 1972, to tell him to cover a
break-in at the Watergate Hotel.
   He scratched down: ``5 men arrested ... at Demo Nat headquarters
w@soph photo equip.''
   Joined by street reporter Carl Bernstein, he went on to uncover
the Watergate scandal that led to the resignation of Richard M.
Nixon as president two years later.
   Nothing so dramatic appeared in ``Public Occurrences, Both
Forreign and Domestick,'' Benjamin Harris' scrawny paper _ three
printed pages and a blank one. It reported a suicide by hanging,
the spread of a smallpox epidemic and rumors about improprieties by
the king of France.
   Harris proposed to publish once a month (``or if any glut of
occurrences happen, oftener''), but the authorities concluded that
his paper contained ``sundry doubtful and uncertain reports'' and
closed it down.
   The ``Paradox of the Press'' is what the exhibit explores _ what
curator David Halaas says has been ``the love-hate relationship
between the people and the news gatherers.''
   ``On one hand, members of the press are seen as truthseekers and
watchdogs of government; on the other hand they're seen as
gossip-mongers and purveyors of slander,'' he said.
   On exhibit are war correspondent Ernie Pyle's typewriter; the
clippings in Abraham Lincoln's pockets when he was assassinated;
the hustling newsboys who learned to condense a news story into a
few catchy words; the zany cartoons of Rube Goldberg such as one
entitled, ``Simple Way to Light a Cigar in an Automobile Traveling
50 Miles an Hour''; a battlefield picture of a grinning, boyish,
helmeted, war cartoonist Bill Mauldin; and the cluttered rolltop
desk of William Allen White, editor-owner of Kansas' Emporia
Gazette who came to epitomize the courageous, common-sense small
town editor.
   And, too, a poster advertising the New York Sunday Tribune. The
picture showed conductors tossing bundles of papers from a moving
train onto a suburban platform. The legend: ``It has an illustrated
supplement and, being a high class, dignified paper, of superb
merit, is especially worthy to be read by intelligent and honest
people.''
   Back at the ASNE meeting, another paradox of the press was the
topic of a speech given by retiring association President Loren
Ghiglione. He told colleagues that journalists have become so
successful _ comfortable, well-paid and suburban _ that they have
forfeited their role as fighters for society's underdogs.
   ``We often think of ourselves as Davids, fighting the
establishment, but the public sees us more and more as status-quo,
establishment Goliaths,'' said Ghiglione, publisher and editor of
the Southbridge (Mass.) News.
   ``While we say we comfort the afflicted and afflict the
comfortable, we need to guard against looking at the world
increasingly through the eyes of the comfortable,'' he said.

   Scientists have arranged 35 atoms to create what
is probably the world's tiniest advertisement, attaining a
precision that may one day lead to development of new materials and
far faster computers.
   It took 22 hours of moving atoms one by one to create the
letters ``IBM,'' researcher Donald Eigler said.
   The design, about 660 billionths of an inch long, is featured in
a report by Eigler and Erhard Schweizer, who did the work at IBM's
Almaden Research Center in San Jose, Calif. The report is in
today's issue of the British journal Nature.
   Physicists called the work a significant step that demonstrates
that individual atoms can be arranged with high precision.
   ``The implications are really remarkable,'' said Stuart Lindsay
of Arizona State University. He called the work ``absolutely
fascinating.''
   Someday, that ability may let researchers build vanishingly tiny
electronic components, allowing computers far faster than today's
supercomputers, scientists said. Atoms may also be assembled
someday into molecules to create new substances and materials, they
said.
   The atom-hauling process was akin to tugging ping pong balls
over the bumpy bottom of an egg carton. The atoms were placed with
such precision that scientists could choose an individual atom on
the surface as the point on which to put a second atom to build the
design, Eigler said in a telephone interview.
   The IBM scientists arranged atoms of a heavy gas called xenon on
a surface made of nickel. They used a device called a scanning
tunneling microscope, which produces extremely detailed images of
surfaces. It can sense atoms on a surface by passing the tip of a
needle over it.
   The tip holds a magnet-like attraction for atoms. When the tip
was brought close enough to a xenon atom, it could pull the atom
across the surface.
   The needle had to tug hard enough to haul a xenon atom over
bumpy nickel atoms on the surface, but gently enough not to lift it
off the surface, Eigler said.
   The amount of pull was adjusted by changing the needle tip's
height. Typically, the tip hovered about 10 billionths of an inch
above a xenon atom.
   Atoms could be moved about 16 billionths of an inch per second.
Once they were positioned, the tip was withdrawn.
   Apart from the ``IBM'' design, researchers also arranged seven
xenon atoms into a chain.
   The work was done at about minus 452 degrees Fahrenheit, almost
as cold as anything can get. That kept the xenon atoms from
wandering, Eigler said.
   In addition, it was done in an extremely high vaccuum to keep
unwanted molecules from contaminating the surface, Eigler said. The
surface can be kept free of contamination for at least a month,
Eigler said. Lindsay said that degree of control was impressive.
   Eigler said he did not know of any commercial use for placing
xenon atoms on nickel. But perhaps some more useful kinds of atoms
will lend themselves to the technique, he said.
   Such atom-by-atom placement should help scientists learn more
about how atoms and molecules behave on surfaces, which might help
in developing semiconductors, the building blocks of many
electronic devices, he said.
   It may also provide a way to store perhaps 2 million times more
electronic information in a given space than is now possible,
Eigler said.
   Electronic information is now recorded in sort of a Morse code
consisting of 1's and 0's, and that might be translated into the
presence or absence of an atom at a particular location, he said.

   The inmates raising their fists in
defiance on the roof of Strangeways Prison may look like dangerous
criminals on the evening TV news. But for many in this northern
industrial city, they're working-class heroes.
   Crowds of supporters have lined police barricades several
hundred yards from the roof of the prison, which has been under
siege since a riot by hundreds of inmates Sunday morning.
   Inmates have continued to surrender and the number still on the
loose inside early today was 20 to 25, authorities said. But the
crowds outside keep growing, and hundreds of people fill the
streets beside the prison.
   Anxious mothers, sisters and wives and other supporters have
followed the actions of rebel inmates on the roof through
binoculars and telephoto camera lenses, waving and shouting names
or words of encouragement.
   The crowd is very much Manchester's under class.
   They are the handicapped and the unemployed, and many are poorly
dressed and dirty. Some also are drunk, and there are many
children, some as young as 9, sharing packs of cigarettes and
lollipops.
   Some of those who have stood for hours in the bitter cold are
former inmates. Others have never before been near the jail, but
nearly all stood vigil because they supported the prisoners'
demands for better jail conditions.
   ``It's a local jail. A lot of people in Manchester have had
people in there and they know what goes on,'' said John Martin
Riley, a construction worker whose brother is serving a 10-year
sentence for armed robbery.
   Strangeways, massive and grim, was built in 1868 to hold 970
men. On Sunday, when the riot began, it held 1,648.
   Even prison officials have used the siege, in which at least one
inmate has been killed and more than 45 people injured, to condemn
gruesome prison conditions.
   At Strangeways, as many as three men are locked in a 5-by-7-foot
cell with a bucket instead of a toilet. They get showers and a
change of clothes once a week. The prisoners claim the food is
poor, frequently cold liver stew and stale bread.
   ``It's a horrible place, ancient and nasty and I hope they burn
it down,'' said Tracy Wilding, 28, a part-time secretary whose
ex-husband once served time in the red-brick jail.
   She said the rebel prisoners were ``very brave actually. They
will all be in big trouble in the end.''
   On Tuesday, Manchester Evening News editor Michael Unger went
inside Strangeways at the request of inmates who wanted to meet a
member of the press. In a story in the Wednesday edition of the
newspaper, Unger described his feelings after meeting two inmates
in their small, bleak cell who wished to surrender.
   ``I knew they were villains but they were tragic villains,''
Unger wrote.
   ``John turned to me. He begged me to write and visit him
whichever prison he ended up in ... then John wept.''
   ``Eric had decided to give himself up. He was very sad, very
low, very frightened. ... Revenge from officers (prison guards)
seemed inevitable, he said. Eric, like John, thanked me before he
was led away ... you couldn't help but feel sympathy,'' Unger wrote.
   Prisoners who surrender are given a medical checkup and
interviewed by a prison inspection panel. Then they receive a
shower and a hot meal and are transferred to other jails.
   Despite their fears and worries, family members continued to
support the dangerous action by the holdouts.
   Patricia Lydon, a part-time hotel receptionist, kept a three-day
vigil outside the jail and intently watched her 24-year-old
brother, Kiern, one of the last prisoners on the roof Wednesday
evening.
   Like many of those in Strangeways, Kiern Lydon was jailed while
awaiting trial and has not been convicted of any charge. Ms. Lydon
was joined Wednesday by her mother and the two women held hands as
they stood in the biting cold wind.
   ``I came to keep him company but I wish I was up there with
him,'' Ms. Lydon said. ``They're fighting for a cause.''
   ``They shouldn't have to come to this to get attention,'' her
mother added, ``just to get normal human conditions.''

<HEAD>States Leading the Way in Economic Development</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   States are inventing their own economic
development policies in a ``quiet revolution'' that came because
they couldn't wait for federal solutions to evolve, a private
research group said today.
   ``The story is that while Washington (the federal government)
continues to be stalemated over what we ought to do over foreign
competition, the states have gone ahead and invented their own
strategies,'' said Doug Ross, president of the Corporation for
Enterprise Development, a research and consulting organization.
   Ross said the states reached a consensus over the last decade
that ``we haven't seen since the Progressive Era 100 years ago,
when the states led the way in figuring out how to make the
transition from an agricultural to an industrial society.''
   Unable to wait for new federal solutions, states ``began
tailoring home-grown strategies to cure state economic ills,'' Ross
said.
   ``States now encourage and support indigenous development _
modernizing in-state businesses, easing their expansion and product
development, educating their workers and facilitating start-ups,''
he explained.
   ``It's a quiet revolution, one that may well have more lasting
impact on the quality of our lives and the prospects for our
children than any other domestic policy shift of the past decade,''
Ross added.
   The findings are included in the fourth annual ``Development
Report Card for the States,'' financed by corporations, labor
unions and private foundations.
   For more than 40 years, the study said, states relied on
``smokestack chasing,'' or luring out-of-state businesses with
incentives and subsidies. That approach no longer was working by
the late 1970s, the study found.
   The study pointed to ``dramatic changes in communication,
transportation and technology'' that often made it possible for
overseas competitors to produce goods cheaper than U.S.
manufacturers could.
   ``Our businesses were losing market share rapidly,'' it said.
``For the first time in our history it began to look as though we
would not be able to promise our children a better life than our
own.''
   The study said some of the new strategies and the extent of
their use include:
   _Forty-four states are stimulating applied research through
research centers and research grants.
   _Forty-five states help businesses commercialize new
technologies or apply state-of-the-art technologies.
   _Thirty-five states offer non-traditional development finance
instruments, like product development, seed capital and venture
capital.
   _Forty states employ new financial mechanisms that leverage
private resources to help meet business capital needs.
   _Forty-seven states have launched specific education reform
measures.
   _Forty-seven states devote state resources to improving the
quality and productivity of their existing work force.
   As a result, the study said, Rust Belt states are resurgent less
than 10 years after the 1981-82 recession nearly did them in.
   ``Recent investments in technology, infrastructure and skill
improvements as well as policy innovations in development finance
and industry modernization have paid off in new economic strength
for these states,'' Ross said.
   According to the study, the Northeast and West Coast states
continue to be the nation's strongest economically although some
show troubling signs, including labor shortages in the Northeast
and a decline of the timber industry in Oregon and Washington.
   Southern states ``continue to make remarkable progress toward
economic health,'' the study said, but ``there is a long uphill
struggle still ahead.''
   With the exception of Utah, however, the Plains and Rocky
Mountain states have not recovered from the recession. ``These
states need intensive care and are not getting it,'' the study said.
   ``The world has changed, but these states have not,'' it said.
``Without substantial change in policy and growth in competitive
capacity, these states face a bleak future indeed.''

<HEAD>Insurers Dispute Claims of Exorbitant Fees by Gardner Museum</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Insurance executives disputed Gardner Museum's
claims that it could not afford theft insurance for the works
recently stolen there.
   Gardner officials said the museum _ target of the biggest art
heist in history _ would have to pay an amount exceeding its $2.8
million operating budget for such insurance. The theft was
committed March 18, when two men dressed as policemen talked their
way in and tied up two security guards.
   But art insurers said theft insurance is affordable even for
small museums.
   ``I don't know why they'd make such a statement,'' said Carl
Allen, chairman of Allen Insurance Associates, a Los Angeles firm
that insures about 100 museums nationwide. ``Those statements are
just exaggerations.''
   Both Allen and Huntington Block, president of a Washington,
D.C., firm that insures 285 museums, said a $100 million policy
covering theft, fire and any other loss or damage would run about
$150,000 annually.
   ``That's a pretty normal figure,'' Block said. ``I don't know
where the Gardner people got the idea it would cost millions.''
   The heist was estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of
dollars. The thieves made off with 11 paintings and prints by
Rembrandt, Vermeer, Manet and Degas and swiped an ancient Chinese
vase and a gilded eagle from the flagpole of a Napoleonic flag.
   Museum spokesman Barry Wanger said Gardner officials reviewed
the museum's insurance policies about two years ago. He said they
had received widely varying cost estimates and concluded that
protection against theft was too expensive.
   ``There were all sorts of figures being bandied about,'' Wanger
said. ``It all depends on who you talk to.''
   Wanger said the museum's board of trustees last week formed a
subcommittee to examine the museum's security measures and
insurance policies. He said theft insurance would be discussed.
   Earlier this week, FBI agent Paul Cavanagh said investigators
continued to receive tips but weren't close to a break in the case.
   The stolen works were considered too well known to be sold on
the open market. The outlook for their recovery is better than
average because they are so familiar, but overall chances remain
slim, investigators said.
   ``About 80 percent of stolen art is never recovered,'' said
Robert Spiel, a private security consultant in Chicago and former
FBI agent specializing in art theft.

<HEAD>Atwater to Undergo Chemotherapy for Brain Tumor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican Party chairman Lee Atwater will
receive chemotherapy in addition to the radiation treatments being
used to combat a brain tumor.
   In a statement issued Wednesday through Republican Party
headquarters, Dr. Paul L. Kornblith described the tumor as
``aggressive and dangerous,'' but said Atwater was fortunate that
it was ``quite small and has been detected early in its
development.''
   Kornblith led a team of physicians at Montefiore Medical Center
in New York City who implanted radioactive isotopes into the tumor
Tuesday in an effort to kill it.
   ``Mr. Atwater has done so well following this procedure that he
will be able to be discharged from the hospital in a few days and
may well be able to return to work in some degree within a couple
of weeks,'' said Kornblith.
   ``Although it is obvious that this tumor is aggressive and
dangerous, Mr. Atwater has many factors working in his favor,''
said Kornblith, who cited the fact the party chairman is only 39
and is in excellent health.
   The tumor, called an astrocytoma, was described as ``the most
common primary brain tumor.''
   ``It does not spread to other parts of the body, but can cause
damage to brain tissue by pressure and by invasion,'' said
Kornblith.
   A brain tumor undergoing unrestrained growth would cause
pressure within the closed skull. This pressure would kill normal
brain cells, thus bringing eventual death by destroying vital
functions.
   Brain tumors can also spread by extension into other parts of
the central nervous system and displace normal cells. During such a
process, there would be a progressive loss of function as normal
brain cells associated with memory, thought, muscle control and
even heartbeat and respiration are lost.
   In addition to the radiation treatment now underway, the doctor
said that ``to assure that any tumor cells peripheral to the main
lesion are destroyed, he will be receiving chemotherapy as well.''
   He said Atwater would receive chemotherapy orally once every six
weeks and it would not limit his activities or functions.
   Atwater's wife, Sally, who is expecting their third child within
days, accompanied him to New York.
   Mary Matalin, GOP chief of staff, said Atwater received numerous
visitors Wednesday, but they had to stand behind a lead shield
because of radioactivity.
   Kornblith said Atwater ``will need to be followed closely and
may need to have additional therapies in the future. For the
present we are delighted with his progress.''

   A real estate broker testified that an associate
of Imelda Marcos threatened him and his family after a 1981 news
report revealed that the Philippine first lady was secretly
negotiating for a posh New York apartment.
   Thomas Bryan, the prosecution's first witness in the fraud trial
of Mrs. Marcos and Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi, said Wednesday
that Gliceria Tantoco did not accuse him of leaking the story to
the New York Post.
   But she ``expressed regret that the information had become
public and said I should fear for my life and my family,'' Bryan
testified in federal court.
   Under questioning by Mrs. Marcos' attorney, Gerald Spence, Bryan
said that he was upset by the threat but that it did not deter him
from further contacts with Mrs. Marcos.
   Bryan, of Fairfax, Va., who was then a $27,000-a-year broker for
the Sotheby's auction house, told how Mrs. Marcos and Mrs. Tantoco
tried to secretly purchase the Park Avenue apartment and contents
put up for sale by Leslie Samuels, a philanthropist and art
collector.
   The so-called ``Samuels Collection'' was among the purchases
that Mrs. Marcos and her husband, former Philippine President
Ferdinand Marcos, made with $160 million embezzled from their
homeland, prosecutors have charged.
   Earlier Wednesday, a lawyer for Khashoggi, once described as the
richest man in the world, portrayed his client as a naive
businessman who committed ``foolish acts.''
   ``If this wasn't such a serious charge, this would be funny,''
James Linn said. ``It is not the sinister thing that the government
makes it out'' to be.
   Khashoggi, 54, is charged with mail fraud and obstruction for
allegedly helping the Marcoses hide their ownership in New York
real estate after the Philippine government won a U.S. court order
in 1986 to prohibit any further transactions involving the
properties.
   Linn admitted that Khashoggi had signed a fake document
involving the buildings, but said this was intended to help a
Marcos associate, not to defraud anyone.
   Khashoggi was trying to head off moves by creditors to foreclose
on the properties, Linn said.
   In explaining the Saudi financier's frequent contacts with
Marcos, Linn also said Khashoggi ``fell for'' a bizarre scheme in
which Marcos offered him 10 percent of a shipload of gold if he
could find a ``safe port'' for the vessel, preferably in the Arab
world.
   Marcos, who died in exile in September, supposedly intended to
use the gold to finance a counter-revolution in case the
Philippines fell to the communists.
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, is charged with racketeering, conspiracy, mail
fraud and obstruction. She could receive up to 50 years in prison
and $1 million in fines. Khashoggi faces up to 10 years in prison
and $500,000 in fines.
   Mrs. Tantoco, a longtime friend of Mrs. Marcos and owner of the
Rustans department store in Manila, and her husband, Bienvenido
Sr., former Philippines ambassador to the Vatican, also were
indicted but are fugitives.
   Bryan testified that Mrs. Marcos offered to buy both the Samuels
apartment and its contents for nearly $14 million. A corporation
conrolled by Mrs. Marcos acquired the artworks for $6 million, but
she lost the apartment when the cooperative's board of directors
rejected Mrs. Tantoco as the purchaser.

   President Bush is expected to sign newly
approved legislation under which the government will gather data on
``hate crimes'' motivated by race, religion, sexual orientation or
ethnic roots.
   ``This bill is a necessary first step toward combating hate
crimes in a systematic and comprehensive manner,'' said Rep.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.
   The House debated the bill Tuesday night and then on Wednesday
voted 402-18 to agree to minor changes made by the Senate and send
it to Bush for his signature.
   The administration has supported the bill, which would require
the Justice Department to keep data on crimes related to race
religion, sexual orientation or ethnic groups. It is supported by a
variety of civil rights, ethnic and police groups.
   The House had already approved the bill and this time consented
to the changes made when the Senate passed the measure on Feb. 8.
   Under the measure, the government would count the crimes of
murder, non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, aggravated
assault, simple assault, intimidation, arson and destruction,
damage or vandalism of property.
   A number of supporters said such a count is needed because of a
rising tide of ``hate crimes'' on the part of neo-Nazi
``skinheads'' and other such groups, although there is no certainty
that such offenses are increasing.
   The Justice Department reported in May 1988 that an accurate
count is not available. But it said: ``These types of offenses are
far more serious than comparable crimes that do not involve
prejudice because they are intended to intimidate an entire group.''
   Estimates of the cost of gathering the information have varied,
but the Justice Department said it would have no trouble making
hate crimes part of the FBI's annually published uniform crime
reports.
   The only House member to rise in opposition to the bill was Rep.
William Dannemeyer, R-Calif., who portrayed it as a concession to
the gay community.
   ``Believe me, whether we like to accept it or not, there are
persons outside this chamber who are crowing: namely, in the
homosexual community,'' he told the House.
   Dannemeyer said homosexuals ``now have something in the law
which they have sought diligently for the last 20 years, whereby
they will equate homosexuality on a par with the traditional
coverage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.''

   The jury deliberating John Poindexter's guilt
or innocence on charges he covered up Oliver North's military
assistance to the Contras and the U.S. role in a shipment of Hawk
missiles to Iran is giving little hint of its progress.
   There were no notes from the jury Wednesday, the third day of
deliberations. The panel of eight women and four men was resuming
its work today.
   Poindexter is accused of conspiracy, two counts of obstructing
Congress and two counts of making false statements. Each charge
carries a maximum five-year prison term and a $250,000 fine.
   Poindexter's lawyers expressed concern over jury instructions
about 5,000 messages that Poindexter erased from his computer
system. Defense lawyers asked U.S. District Judge Harold Greene to
clarify the instructions, but the judge refused.
   The destruction of the messages is included in an obstruction
charge alleging the former national security adviser tried to
conceal from Congress the U.S. role in the Hawk shipment.
   The jurors asked for copies of the messages, which were saved on
a backup tape at the White House.
   Greene rejected the jurors' request Tuesday, saying the notes
hadn't been introduced as evidence at the trial and so ``you can't
have them.''
   Defense attorneys said Wednesday the judge may have misled the
jury into believing that it couldn't consider other evidence about
the messages.
   Among that evidence is a stipulation _ a statement agreed to by
prosecutors and the defense _ that none of the messages were from
1985, when the Hawk missiles were shipped to Iran. The inference
that could be drawn is that Poindexter did not cover up evidence
about the Hawk shipment by erasing the messages.
   The Hawk shipment is the focus of the indictment against
Poindexter. Ten days after 18 missiles were delivered by a CIA
proprietary airline to Iran, Poindexter had President Reagan sign a
document which ratified the shipment.
   The document depicted U.S. involvement in an arrangement to
trade arms for hostages.
   Poindexter tore up the document on Nov. 21, 1986, hours after
telling Congress he hadn't found out about the Hawks shipment until
two months after it occurred.
   He destroyed the document eight days after Reagan said in a
nationally televised address that ``we did not ... trade weapons
... for hostages.''
   The prosecution contends that Poindexter lied to Congress to
hide the existence of the presidential document.

   The House is urging President Bush to reaffirm
his commitment to Lithuania, while a group of senators warns that
the issue could threaten the future of U.S.-Soviet relations.
   The House voted 416-3 Wednesday for a resolution calling on Bush
to reaffirm his commitment to an independent Lithuania and take
steps as soon as possible to ``normalize diplomatic relations''
between Washington and the Baltic republic.
   The resolution, which has no force of law, is similar to one
passed earlier by the Senate.
   Thirty-one senators, in a letter to Bush, said the president
should take a more aggressive stand in support of Lithuania, which
is attempting to secede from the Soviet Union.
   ``Now is the time to inform the Soviet leadership what specific
actions our government may take in response to the further use of
armed force in Lithuania,'' the letter said.
   The congressional appeals in support of an independent Lithuania
came as Secretary of State James A. Baker III raised the issue with
visiting Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   Shevardnadze said afterward, ``I have no doubt we will be able
to find a solution to that situation, that we will find a wise and
fair solution.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and Minority
Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., met late Wednesday with Shevardnadze at
the Soviet embassy. The senators had requested the meeting, and
Shevardnadze said, ``I appreciate your visiting our embassy.''
   Asked how his session with Baker went, Shevardnadze said the two
discussed issues ``in a constructive language.'' He declined to say
whether the United States had made any demands about Lithuania.
   The Senate letter to Bush warned that if the Soviets continue to
thwart the Lithuanians' drive for self-determination and don't
engage in good-faith negotiations, the issue will have ``serious
negative implications for U.S.-Soviet relations.''
   The letter was originated by Sens. Bill Armstrong, R-Colo., and
Donald Riegle, D-Mich. Eighteen Republicans and 13 Democrats signed
it.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, did not sign the letter, but accused the
Soviets of turning a ``deaf ear'' on the Lithuanians. He said the
tense situation could reverse progress in the U.S.-Soviet
relationship.
   Opposing the House resolution were Reps. David Obey, D-Wis.,
David Nagle, D-Iowa, and George Crockett, D-Mich.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., said the State Department did not
want the resolution passed, but he said it was necessary.
   Meantime, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., flew to Poland intending
to cross the border into Lithuania for a firsthand look at the
Baltic state.
   ``I want to see if (Soviet President Mikhail) Gorbachev is
indeed a man of peace who adheres to the principles of open borders
and freedom of travel,'' D'Amato said before he left.
   Lithuania's decision last month to declare itself an independent
republic has put Bush in a difficult diplomatic spot. Some people,
including Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., who recently met with
Gorbachev, have told the president that taking too hard a line with
Gorbachev could topple him, and that would not be in Washington's
best interest.
   But Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., said that if Gorbachev is too
weak to withstand the challenge of Lithuania, the United States
shouldn't stake any future claim on him.

<HEAD>USDA Economists Say Freer Farm Trade Equals Pricier Chicken</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If negotiations to liberalize world
agricultural trade are successful, look for fried chicken dinners
to cost a bit more.
   It wouldn't be much of an increase, and it's all pretty much of
a guess, anyway, says the Agriculture Department. But when
economists and computers get together, that's the way it goes.
   The department's Economic Research Service assumed in its study
that ``a hypothetical one-time 10 percent increase in corn prices''
would occur if ongoing talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade succeed in liberalizing trade.
   Two computer models were set up to see what would happen to the
broiler industries in the United States and Canada if producers had
to pay more for corn used to feed their birds.
   Prices would go up in both countries, at the producer level and
at retail counters, the study concluded.
   One of the report's authors, economist Greg Gajewski, said
Wednesday in a telephone interview that the study did not forecast
that a GATT settlement would boost corn prices by 10 percent.
   ``It's not based on past historical data,'' he said. ``And
that's because there's never been such a movement to free trade.''
   Gajewski said an earlier study last year showed that if the GATT
talks resulted in liberalized trade, the U.S. market prices for
corn _ the prices that broiler producers would pay _ could rise
between 1 percent and 11 percent, a huge range of possibilities.
   For purposes of the study, a 10 percent increase was used.
Gajewski said the main point of the study is that U.S. broiler
prices would be much more responsive than Canadian prices to an
increase in corn costs.
   In the United States _
   Broiler prices at the producer level would start climbing
immediately, with the monthly maximum increase of 3.9 percent
occurring in the fifth month. However, prices would continue to
rise at slower rates for an additional 27 months.
   Over the entire period, each percentage point in corn prices
would lift producer broiler prices by an average of nearly 0.4
percent.
   At retail stores, broiler price increases would resemble those
at the producer level, but the rise would be smaller. The peak
monthly increase of 2.8 percent would occur in the fourth month. It
would take an additional 26 months for the increases to end.
   In Canada _
   Broiler price increases at the farm would be delayed a month but
would then rise and build strength through the 15th month with a
peak rise of 4.3 percent. Farm broiler prices would continue up at
lesser rates for another seven months.
   On the retail level, Canadian broiler prices would begin
increasing immediately, gaining strength through the 16th month,
with a maximum monthly grain of 2.9 percent. The rise would
continue more slowly for another six months.
   The study, described in the April issue of Agricultural Outlook
magazine, showed that the Canadian broiler price increases would
taper off eight to 10 months sooner than in the United States,
which would have more volatile month-to-month responses.
   Some of the U.S.-Canada difference may be due to marketing
structures, the report said. In Canada, provincial governments
control broiler output through marketing quotas, and the federal
government sets an import quota to help stabilize prices.
   Broiler production in the United States is largely unregulated,
and the top 20 firms account for about 80 percent of the total
output.

   Some Mexican cattle are getting fast-track
clearance by the Agriculture Department to enter designated U.S.
feedlots because drought-shriveled pastures have been reduced to
starvation levels.
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, said Wednesday the agency's usual
import regulations have been temporarily set aside so the cattle
can be brought in.
   Normally, he said, imported animals and their herds of origin
have to be tested and found free of cattle brucellosis and
tuberculosis.
   The usual requirement is that imported animals must come from
herds that have been tested for the diseases no more than three
months before the date of U.S. entry. With the special waiver, the
Mexican cattle will be able to enter approximately three months
sooner.
   ``The drought-stricken pasture lands in parts of Mexico cannot
support the cattle,'' Glosser said. ``By bringing the animals
temporarily to U.S. quarantined feedlots under strict movement
restrictions, we can avert starvation of the animals and still
protect the health of U.S. livestock.''
   Glosser said the cattle will be taken directly to quarantined
feedlots in USDA-sealed trucks or rail cars. They will not be sold
to any U.S. buyer and will return directly to Mexico from the
feedlots. The animals will be kept apart from U.S. cattle while in
the feedlots, which are mostly in Texas.
   There was no estimate of how many Mexican cattle may be imported
under the special program, said agency spokeswoman Anita Brown.

   The Corn Belt has been selected for a new
Agriculture Department testing program designed to protect ground
water from contamination by fertilizers and pesticides.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said Wednesday the
research is scheduled to begin this summer. It will be undertaken
on farmland overlying aquifers in nine states: Iowa, Kansas,
Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Ohio and
Wisconsin.
   The research is part of a government-wide water quality
initiative provided in the Bush administration's budget requests,
he said.
   Spending for all of the Agriculture Department's water quality
activities this year is budgeted at $158 million, compared with
$112.7 million last year, Yeutter said. The administration's
request for the fiscal 1991 year that will begin Oct. 1 is for $207
million.
   Yeutter said about $3.7 million of this year's funds has been
targeted for the Corn Belt projects.

<HEAD>6 Million Requests for Filing Extension Expected</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As many as 6 million couples and individuals
are expected to ask the Internal Revenue Service for an extra four
months to file their tax returns this year.
   The filing deadline for most Americans is April 16, but the IRS
will grant an extension automatically if a taxpayer unable to file
by that date mails in a Form 4868 instead. However, IRS spokesman
Steve Pyrek noted Wednesday, the form must be accompanied by a
check for estimated taxes owed.
   It's not a good idea to underestimate your taxes when you seek
an extension of filing time, says accountant Saul Epstein of the
Philadelphia office of Ernst &amp; Young.
   ``If you underestimate, you'll have to pay interest on the
unpaid amount, and if it (the unpaid amount) is more than 10
percent of your total liability, there will be an additional
failure-to-pay penalty.''
   In some cases, Pyrek said, an underestimate also can result in a
failure-to-file penalty.
   The IRS expects 111 million returns to be filed this year,
although not all taxpayers will meet either the regular deadline or
an extended deadline. Through March 30, 60.1 million returns had
been received, 2 million more than during the same period a year
ago.
   The IRS has processed 51.5 million of those returns, 3.5 million
more than at this time last year. Nearly 79 percent of returns are
qualifying for refunds; 40.5 million this year for $34.4 billion.
At this time last year, about 78 percent, or 37.3 million, received
refunds, which totaled $30.5 billion.
   Nearly 3.8 million taxpayers have filed electronic returns, 270
percent above the same period of 1989 and considerably more than
the IRS had forecast for the entire year.
   Electronic returns, filed for a fee by IRS-authorized companies,
are transmitted to the IRS via telephone line. They eliminate a
considerable amount of paperwork and errors and allow the agency to
promise refunds in two or three weeks.
   Taxpayers who file paper returns between now and the deadline
can expect refunds in about eight weeks.
   A person who filed a return at least eight weeks ago may call a
computerized IRS telephone number to find out why any refund has
not been received. Toll-free numbers for that service are listed in
the back of the tax-form instructions.
   To use this service you will need to know the first Social
Security number on your return, your filing status and the exact
amount of the refund.
   The IRS said more than 10 million people have made such calls
this year.
   While most Americans must file by midnight April 16, residents
of New England and most counties of New York have an extra day.
That is because April 16 is Patriot's Day, a holiday, in
Massachusetts. The IRS service center to which those people file
their returns is in Andover, Mass.
   A person whose home and main workplace are outside the United
States and Puerto Rico on April 16 automatically has until June 15
to file.

<HEAD>Antimissile Budget Includes Money for Unneeded Satellite</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration's 1991 budget request
for Star Wars research includes development money for an $8 billion
satellite that won't be part of the antimissile defense, the
project director says.
   Air Force Lt. Gen. George L. Monahan, manager of the Strategic
Defense Initiative, the official name of the antimissile program,
said Wednesday that although the satellite ``no longer is an
essential element'' of Star Wars, the spending is justified.
   Bush's 1991 budget includes $265 million to start full-scale
development of the satellite. The proposed total budget for SDI in
the next fiscal year is $4.5 billion.
   The satellite, called a boost-phase surveillance and tracking
system, is important in its own right because it could replace the
less capable existing satellites that provide early warning of
ballistic missile launches, Monahan said.
   The general told the House Armed Services research and
development subcommittee that $1 billion already has been spent on
research for the new satellite. The total cost of developing and
producing it would be about $8 billion.
   ``I think it's very wise to go forward with it,'' Monahan said.
He added that his office is studying ways that the satellite and
radar network that would be part of a Star Wars system might be
restructured to save money. He told reporters afterward that he
could not provide an estimate of potential savings.
   Many members of Congress are looking for ways of reducing Star
Wars spending. Last year, the administration's funding request was
cut by about $1 billion, to $3.6 billion, and support for the
project appears to have eroded further as a result of historic
political shifts in the East bloc since last fall.
   Rep. William Dickinson, R-Ala., said congressional supporters of
SDI such as himself need more help from the White House if further
cuts are to be avoided.
   ``The president's going to have to get involved,'' he said.
``He's going to have to draw a line in the sand.''
   Under the Star Wars concept as recently as 1988, the boost-phase
surveillance and tracking system would communicate with sensor
satellites to help guide space-based weapons toward the ballistic
missile targets during flight.
   Now, scientists have proposed building a new kind of space-based
weapon, known as Brilliant Pebbles. Each weapon, or pebble, would
have its own in-house tracking and sensor capability, so that it
would not need to interact with separate satellites to ``see'' and
home in on missiles.
   Monahan gave the House panel an upbeat assessment of technical
progress in research on Brilliant Pebbles, which are kinetic, or
non-explosive, weapons that would be permanently based in space and
could be activated from a ground command center. The kinetic
warhead would destroy its target simply by crashing into it.
   No tests of Brilliant Pebbles have been conducted, but Monahan
said he believed that by late 1993 or early 1994 the Pentagon
should be ready to begin full-scale development of the weapons.

<HEAD>North American Cocaine Smuggling Routes Shifting To Europe</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Latin American cocaine barons
stymied by Washington's war on drugs are relying more and more on
European ports to get their merchandise to U.S. streets, police say.
   Moreover, officials say, all across Europe police seizures of
cocaine have at least doubled in the past few years and the drug is
challenging heroin as the narcotic of choice on the continent.
   Last month, the National Police Intelligence Service published
figures that show cocaine seizures in the Netherlands to have risen
dramatically over the past three years.
   Dutch police confiscated 7,700 pounds of cocaine in the first
three months of this year alone _ more than double the 3,120 pounds
seized in all of last year and almost three times the 1,130 pounds
in 1988.
   Commissioner Peter Broeders of the intelligence service's Crime
Information Division said drug kingpins from Colombia and other
Latin American countries ``are searching for routes that are less
vulnerable than the direct routes to the United States.''
   Broeders, in a radio interview Tuesday upon his return from a
two-week trip visiting drug enforcement agencies in the United
States, attributed the shift to President Bush's $7.9 billion war
on drugs.
   ``The tough way in which Americans are handling the drug trade
from South America is forcing the drug barons to shift their supply
lines, and they're doing it through Europe,'' Broeders said.
   Crime Information Division spokesman Peter de Waard said in an
interview Wednesday that another factor in the growing drug
seizures is that ``the North American market is so saturated Latin
American drug barons can't sell there any more.''
   Instead, they are turning to Europe, he said.
   On Feb. 28, police in the Dutch North Sea port of Ijmuiden
seized 6,600 pounds of cocaine concealed in a shipment of frozen
fruit juice. Although the cocaine's origin remains unclear, police
said four of the eight suspects they arrested claimed to be
Colombian nationals.
   Broeders said much of the cocaine smuggled into this country is
believed to be going through Rotterdam, packed mostly in freight
containers.
   Rotterdam is the biggest port in the world and Broeders said it
is physically impossible to open and inspect all of the 2.5 million
containers shipped through the port every year.
   Police seizures of cocaine across Europe reached 15,435 pounds
in 1989.
   French police hauled in 2,000 pounds in 1989, up 58 percent from
the previous year. Less than 220 pounds were seized in that country
in 1982.
   In Great Britain, seizures more than quadrupled between 1986 and
1989, with police confiscating 935 pounds last year.
   Although heroin seems to be Europe's most widely used drug,
cocaine is taking over.
   ``1987 was the last year that Dutch police hauled in more heroin
than cocaine,'' De Waard said.
   Both drugs are relatively easy to obtain in the Netherlands,
which rarely prosecutes drug abusers but concentrates on capturing
traffickers.
   ``Drug-related crime is increasing dramatically in Holland. We
are seeing more shootouts between drug gangs,'' De Waard said.
   Until recently, drug turf battles were relatively rare in the
Netherlands, which also has experienced almost none of the violent
crime associated with crack, the highly addictive cocaine
derivative.

<TEXT>
   Former President Richard M. Nixon is sidelined
with a heart problem but his doctor says it can be taken care of
with medication and a little rest.
   The former president, 77, was diagnosed on Wednesday as
suffering from a benign supra ventricular heart rhythm disturbance.
Dr. Jeffrey Borer, a cardiologist at Cornell University Medical
College in New York City, said that means signals that cause the
heart to beat were being generated abnormally.
   ``That's not a big problem and not hard to deal with,'' Borer
said. ``In these circumstances we generally control the situation
with medication because the heart is beating faster than it ought
to and therefore is less efficient.''
   Nixon was not hospitalized. His aide, John Taylor, said the
former president will recuperate at his home in Saddle River, N.J.
and that he is expected to resume his full schedule when the
condition is brought under control.
   ``He's been feeling run down since a speech he made in Miami on
March 27,'' Taylor said. ``On the down side is that the president
is not going to be able to go on his daily morning walk.''
   Nixon will postpone an appearance on April 12 before the World
Affairs Council of Boston.
   The former president recently published his eighth book, ``In
the Arena,'' a memoir.

<HEAD>Two GOP Senators Call for Cutback of B-2, ATF Programs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Republican members of the Senate Armed
Services Committee today called on President Bush to limit
production of the B-2 bomber and delay the Advanced Tactical
Fighter as part of additional cuts in defense spending.
   ``We believe that the United States can meet its defense
requirements with budget levels lower than those proposed by the
administration,'' said Sens. William Cohen of Maine and John McCain
of Arizona.
   Although caution is appropriate in crafting a defense policy,
using the possible return of the Cold War as an excuse for delaying
changes in the military is unwarranted, the lawmakers said.
   ``If we do not reorient our defense planning to the genuine
needs of the future, we will squander a unique opportunity and
waste declining defense resources,'' Cohen and McCain said in
releasing their recommendations.
   The administration has proposed about a 2 percent reduction in
defense spending in each of the next five years, but twice that
amount is realistic, the GOP senators said.
   By their calculations, the current defense budget of about $300
billion would be reduced by about $50 billion.
   Cohen and McCain did not address spending on every major defense
program, but did make several recommendations on big-ticket items
that have come under attack in Congress.
   Among the proposals were limiting production of the B-2 stealth
bomber while concentrating on equipping B-52 and B-1 bombers with
advanced cruise missiles.
   Current plans call for building 132 of the radar-evading
aircraft by 1996 at a cost of more than $70 billion, but Air Force
Secretary Donald Rice said Tuesday that the administration is
weighing alternatives to that proposal.
   A bipartisan group of lawmakers on Wednesday released a
Congressional Budget Office report that concluded that scaling back
production of the B-2 will force up the cost of a single plane to
more than $1 billion.
   ``It confirms my very worst fears that if you stretch out the
B-2 program it simply adds billions of dollars to its costs,'' said
Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., a cosponsor of legislation that would
stop procurement of the aircraft at the 15 planes now in production.
   In their recommendations, Cohen and McCain said it was unlikely
that Congress would approve spending for two land-based, nuclear
missiles _ the multiple-warhead, rail-garrison MX and the
single-warhead Midgetman.
   ``While rail-basing for the MX is less expensive and probably
can be deployed sooner than the small ICBM, we should actively
pursue reciprocal restrictions with the Soviet Union to cut back
ICBMs _ including the rail-based MX _ in favor of single-warhead
missiles such as the small ICBM,'' the lawmakers said.
   Cohen and McCain also proposed gearing the Strategic Defense
Initiative to defend against threats from nations other than the
Soviet Union. The nearly $4 billion approved for the antimissile
program this year should be considered the upper limit for all
future budgets, they said.
   Regarding the nation's naval forces, the senators proposed a
reduction in the overall number of ships and deferral of the Navy's
version of the Advanced Tactical Fighter.
   In addition, many of the Air Force's modernization programs,
including their Advanced Tactical Fighter, are ``inappropriate or
exceed the requirements for regional contingencies, which can be
met with currently deployed systems with upgrades as necessary.''

   Legislation giving federal health officials
authority to decide which diseases can be used to keep foreigners
out of the country would allow AIDS to be removed as a barrier to
immigration, sponsors say.
   The measure was introduced Wednesday by Rep. J. Roy Rowland,
D-Ga., on behalf of the National Commission on AIDS.
   The commission, whose members were appointed by Congress and the
White House, has urged elimination of the entry restriction for
people with AIDS and infection with the human immunodeficiency
virus, or HIV, which causes AIDS.
   ``There is no rationale for it,'' said Dr. June Osborn,
commission chairwoman, noting that numerous international groups
have criticized the restriction. ``The U.S. is being looked at with
such astonished horror.''
   The federal Centers for Disease Control recently recommended
that AIDS be stricken from the list. That recommendation is under
review by Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan, but
officials say his department lacks authority to remove it.
   The entry restriction has prompted dozens of international
organizations and agencies to boycott the Sixth International
Conference on AIDS in San Francisco in June. France and Switzerland
also have said they won't send official delegations to the meeting.
   The Bush administration's position on the bill was unclear.
Sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Wednesday
night that a decision had not been reached on whether to support,
oppose or take no position on the bill.
   Under a law passed in 1987 by Congress, HIV infection was added
to the list of contagious diseases for which foreigners can be
barred from entering the country.
   Administration officials have said they could not eliminate the
restriction because it was imposed by Congress.
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., a cosponsor of the bill, said the
legislation would make ``absolutely clear'' that HHS has authority
to add or remove diseases from the list, based on public health
considerations.
   ``We should let health officials make the health decisions,''
Waxman said. ``That is what we did before 1987 and that is what we
should continue to do.''

<TEXT>
   Ryan White's hospitalization has softened
hearts in the town that fought to bar him from its schools, where
residents recall the painful episode as an unavoidable chapter in
the nation's education on AIDS.
   ``I don't think that anybody in Kokomo feels good about what
happened,'' said Art Peirce, a longtime resident. He described
Kokomo's reaction to White as one of fear.
   ``If it hadn't happened here it would have happened somewhere
else. It allowed the nation to focus on the problem so some good
did come out of it. ``That fear has certainly been modified through
education and experience.''
   White, 18, remained in critical condition today at Riley
Hospital for Children in Indianapolis with an AIDS-related
respiratory infection complicated by hemophilia. Doctors said
Wednesday his condition had stabilized.
   White is on a life-support system that helps him breathe. He has
been unconscious and heavily sedated so the life-support system
would function more efficiently.
   His physician, Dr. Martin B. Kleiman, said patients as ill as
White had recovered.
   ``He's holding on. His status deteriorated in the first day or
two and then reached a plateau. Any patient who is critical must
stabilize before he can recover and Ryan has stabilized,'' Kleiman
said.
   Singer Elton John spent a second full day with the family at the
hospital, making jokes and playing tapes of his music, family
spokeswoman Carrie Van Dyke said.
   Calls from celebrities flooded the hospital switchboard,
including one from Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., whose Senate
committee on Wednesday approved a bill to spend an additional $600
million a year for two years to combat AIDS.
   ``This one's for you, Ryan,'' Kennedy said in a telephone
conversation with White's mother, Jeannie.
   Residents of Kokomo said they hoped White would recover. Some
reflected on the community's unsuccessful legal battle in 1985 to
keep White out of school.
   Attorney David Rosselot, who represented the school district
that tried to keep Ryan out after it learned he had contracted AIDS
from tainted blood products, said he would not take a similar case
today.
   ``I think there is a lot more knowledge available and that,
coupled with the fact that the law has changed about how an AIDS
child should be treated in the school system, would lead me to say
no,'' he said.
   Rosselot defended the community's reaction.
   ``The only thing that was guaranteed to parents .. at that time
was it was communicable and it's fatal,'' he said.
   ``There is nobody in this community that at some point in time
hasn't said, `But for the grace of God, that could have been me or
my children or my relatives,' and there is nothing except concern
and sympathy for him.''

<HEAD>FAA: Pan Am Security Flawed for Eight Months After Bombing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pan American World Airways' security at
Frankfurt airport in West Germany remained dangerously flawed for
more than eight months after the bombing of Flight 103, federal
aviation officials say.
   ``All passengers flying out of Frankfurt by Pan Am are at great
risk,'' said a June 1989 internal Federal Aviation Administration
memo read Wednesday at a hearing by the Presidential Commission on
Aviation Security and Terrorism.
   Investigators believe terrorists smuggled a bomb in baggage
aboard Flight 103 in Frankfurt before the flight switched planes in
London and blew up over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 people
aboard and 11 on the ground.
   The seven-member commission, which has been looking into the
Dec. 21, 1988 bombing, will send President Bush recommendations
next month for avoiding future aviation terrorist attacks and
improving government response if they occur.
   Top federal aviation officials testified Wednesday that the
Frankfurt airport is now ``a model station.'' But they acknowledged
that serious security problems persisted there until a team of
airline and FAA officials flew to the airport last September and
corrected the flaws.
   Commission Chairwoman Ann McLaughlin sharply criticized the FAA
for allowing the problems with Pan Am at Frankfurt to go
uncorrected for so long.
   ``I've never seen anything like this in my life,'' Ms.
McLaughlin told FAA Administrator James Busey. Busey, who took
office last July, said part of the problem was that his agency was
leaderless for part of the time after the bombing.
   Ms. McLaughlin said that was an ``absolutely unacceptable''
excuse for failures at the airport. The FAA is responsible for
overseeing security of U.S. airlines in the United States and
abroad.
   Pan Am Chairman Thomas Plaskett told the commission that the
airline followed inspection procedures approved by the FAA. The
airline is contesting $630,000 in fines levied by the agency last
September for security lapses related to Flight 103 and five other
European flights around the same time.
   Alleged Pan Am security lapses in 1989 have not been the subject
of FAA fines, however.
   FAA Associate Administrator Monte Belger and security chief Ray
Salazar testified that security problems were found at Frankfurt
during inspections in January, May, June and August 1989.
   ``If I was frustrated in June, I hit the ceiling in August,''
said Belger, who received reports of the Frankfurt inspections.
   He said problems included failure to properly check personnel
who serviced Pan Am planes at the airport, failure to secure planes
overnight and problems with ground personnel at the airport.
   Salazar denied sworn statements by Pan Am officials that he gave
them permission before December 1988 to X-ray checked luggage as an
alternative to requirements that it be matched to passengers at
Frankfurt.
   Salazar said that procedure was a violation of FAA rules,
although Pan Am was never fined for it. He said FAA lawyers advised
against including the charge when fines were levied.
   Paul Hudson, head of one of two organizations formed by
relatives of Flight 103 victims, said the FAA and Pan Am
disclosures at Wednesday's hearing confirmed family members'
deepest concerns about airline security.
   ``My daughter had no chance at all,'' Hudson said in an
interview outside the hearing room after Pan Am's Plaskett
testified that luggage at Frankfurt was not hand-searched and that
no special procedures were used following threats against Pan Am
flights to the United States.

<HEAD>Bush Urges South African President to Lift State of Emergency</HEAD>

   President Bush is urging the white minority
government of South Africa and the black opposition to bend and
work out a peaceful resolution of their differences.
   Bush called on President F.W. de Klerk on Wednesday to lift the
state of emergency. And he urged blacks to renounce violence,
especially against one another.
   ``We stand ready to support this fragile process in any way we
can,'' Bush said in a speech marking the anniversary of the 1968
assassination of civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
   ``There must be an end to the tragic cycle of violence, a task
that demands great courage and resolve from all South African
leaders, black and white,'' he said in a speech to the 20th
anniversary dinner of the Joint Center for Political Studies.
   Violent repression by the government has failed, along with
violence by the opponents of Pretoria's apartheid system of racial
separation, Bush said.
   ``Most tragically, the senseless violence perpetrated by blacks
against blacks has become a major impediment to rapid progress
toward a negotiated settlement. All sides should follow the spirit
of Martin Luther King Jr. and renounce violence,'' he said.
   He said de Klerk should lift the state of emergency and free all
political prisoners, two of the conditions that would be required
before the United States could lift economic sanctions against
Pretoria.
   He praised de Klerk for freeing black nationalist leader Nelson
Mandela and for lifting the ban on dissident political parties.
   He has invited de Klerk and Mandela to meet with him separately
at the White House.
   Bush said he was encouraged ``by signs that all sides share a
growing commitment'' toward negotiations to resolve the South
African turmoil.
   He said U.S. businesses that operate in South Africa also ``must
work for change.''
   ``And we will make clear our strong conviction that multi-party
democracy based on a vigorous free enterprise system represents the
best model for any successful society,'' he said.
   Bush also took the occasion to talk about the legacy of Abraham
Lincoln, whose Emancipation Proclamation freed the slaves.
   He predicted that ``the day will come, and it is not far off,
when the legacy of Lincoln will finally be fulfilled at 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue _ when a black man or woman will sit in the
Oval Office.''
   ``When that day comes, the most remarkable thing about it will
be how naturally it occurs.''
   Virginia Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, who was guest of honor at the
dinner, predicted that victories by black politicians like himself
and New York Mayor David Dinkins will become more common.
   ``We are not oddities. We are not aberrations. ... We are merely
the extensions of those dreams,'' Wilder said in a reference to
King's historic ``I have a dream'' speech.

<HEAD>Former White House Aide Confirmed for Justice Post</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former White House adviser Robert Sweet has
won Senate confirmation to head the nation's $70 million juvenile
justice program.
   Despite opposition from several interest groups, approval came
Wednesday on a voice vote.
   Sweet, 52, figured prominently in turmoil at the Education
Department eight years ago, and Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., had
pushed for defeat of the nomination.
   Kerry said in a letter to members of the Senate Judiciary
Committee that Sweet's ``approach to juvenile justice is naive at
best and in any case not congruent with the statutory requirements
of the position to which he has been nominated.''
   By law, the administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and
Delinquency Prevention in the Justice Department must have
experience in juvenile justice.
   Critics of the nomination _ ranging from the Washington-based
liberal group People for the American Way to the National
Parent-Teacher Association _ complained that he lacked the required
background.
   Sweet replied that his experience in education fulfills the
requirement. He is a former high school teacher and textbook
salesman and served as an Education Department official and White
House education adviser in the Reagan administration.
   He also was at one time the head of the New Hampshire affiliate
of the Moral Majority. Some of the opposition stems from infighting
at the Education Department. Former Education Secretary Terrel Bell
was critical of Sweet in his memoirs, ``The Thirteenth Man.''

<HEAD>Colleagues Remember Sarah Vaughan as a Singer's Singer</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Remembering Sassy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sarah Vaughan was remembered by the music
industry and friends as a singer's singer whose powerful range and
mastery of scat-style jazz earned her acclaim as ``The Divine One''
_ or simply ``Sassy.''
   Vaughan died of lung cancer Tuesday night at her home in the
Hidden Hills area of the San Fernando Valley. She was 66.
   ``Sarah Vaughan was a complete vocalist and musician,'' Frank
Sinatra said Wednesday. ``She was an instrument and she had an
incredible sense of humor. Put those attributes together and we're
talking about one of the finest vocalists in the history of pop
music.''
   Some of her most memorable songs were ``Broken-Hearted Melody,''
``Send in the Clowns,'' ``Misty'' and ``If You Could See Me Now.''
   ``Now that she's gone, there's no one to measure great singers
with,'' said entertainer and jazz buff Bill Cosby.
   ``Sarah was like a sister to me and I loved her very much,''
said Sammy Davis Jr., who is convalescing at his Beverly Hills home
from a recurrence of throat cancer.
   Mayor Tom Bradley ordered flags at all city buildings lowered to
half-staff through Friday. The last time flags were lowered for the
death of a celebrity was a year ago, when Lucille Ball died.
   A moment of silence was observed Wednesday at the Apollo Theater
in New York's Harlem, where Vaughan was discovered a half-century
ago.
   Vaughan's style was formed by her early association with be-bop.
She sang with Billy Eckstine, Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie in
the Earl Hines and Eckstine bands in the 1940s.
   ``There will never be another one like Sarah Vaughan,''
Gillespie said Wednesday.
   Her nicknames were ``The Divine One,'' ``The Divine Sarah'' and
``Sassy.'' Often, after she introduced the musicians accompanying
her, she coyly introduced herself as ``Della Reese.''
   Her deep, sultry voice and dramatic colorings distinguished her
as the finest jazz singer of the '40s.
   ``Sarah Vaughan was among the most powerful, influential and
soulful voices of all time, a perfectionist with an astonishing
vocal range and a genius for conveying emotion through her music,''
said Quincy Jones, who first worked with Vaughan in 1957 as the
arranger on ``Misty.''
   ``Vocally, she was a giant singer,'' said Mel Torme. ``Had Sarah
decided to go another way she would have been a great legit singer.
She could have done opera, for instance.''
   Colleagues also praised Vaughan's mastery of scat singing,
improvising, swinging and phrasing. But she never thought of
herself as a specialist.
   ```Why do they always call me a jazz singer? I'm just a singer,'
Sarah would always say,'' said her manager and friend, Harold Levy.
``She was a singer's singer. The greatest.''
   Pianist George Shearing, who worked with Vaughan in the late
1940s, said she was the first vocalist he performed with after
emigrating to the United States from Great Britain.
   ``She's going to be very much missed in terms of being the
exemplary voice in the pop field. She was the best contralto in
pop,'' he said. ``She would hold on to great, big long notes
without vibrato.''
   Born in Newark, N.J., Vaughan studied piano from age 7 and was a
church choir member and organist by 12. Her father, a carpenter,
played guitar and her mother sang in the choir.
   In 1942, she accepted a dare _ trumpeter-trombonist Jabbo Smith
claimed it was his idea _ and sang ``Body and Soul'' at an Apollo
Theater amateur contest.
   ``I put her on and, I'll tell you, she was absolutely
astounding,'' the Apollo's Ralph Cooper said Wednesday. ``She was
the most unusual thing to take the stage at the Apollo.''
   She made her debut with the Hines band at the Apollo in 1943,
went with Eckstine a year later when he formed his own band, then
sang with John Kirby's group. By 1946 she had established herself
as a solo artist.
   Vaughan won Esquire's new star award in 1947 and the Down Beat
poll as best female jazz vocalist from 1947 through 1952. She won a
Grammy for best female vocal jazz performance for ``Gershwin,
Live!'' in 1982.
   Other songs she recorded included ``You're Blase,'' ``I Cover
the Waterfront,'' ``Body and Soul,'' ``Tenderly,'' ``Everything I
Have Is Yours,'' ``I'll Remember April,'' ``Easy Living,'' ``I
Remember Clifford,'' ``Here's That Rainy Day'' and ``Don't Blame
Me.'' She recorded ``Lover Man'' in 1945 with Gillespie and Parker
and ``Perdido'' with Count Basie's band.
   Her first husband was trumpeter George Treadwell. She also was
married to professional football player Clyde Atkins, Las Vegas
restaurateur Marshall Fisher and trumpeter Waymon Reed.
   Vaughan is survived by her 87-year-old mother, Ada, and her
daughter, actress Paris Vaughan. Funeral arrangements were
incomplete.

<HEAD>Novello Says Localities Must Decide on AIDS Education for Teens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Surgeon General Antonia Novello says
adolescents need to be taught about AIDS, but that communities
should decide for themselves how to do that.
   ``What is good for Iowa might not be good for New York,'' she
said Wednesday during a meeting with reporters. ``You always have
to take into consideration ... the state where they live, what is
the morality of that particular community and what is the incidence
(of AIDS) in that community.''
   She said that while some parents object to AIDS education
because they feel their children are not at risk, ``at least some
education has to be going on.''
   ``You ... at least have (to have) the data out there,'' she
said, ``but you have to make sure it's done with sensitivity.
   ``And in the cases in which monogamy and abstention doesn't
work, then the adolescent should know that the condom, in the
absence of a vaccine, might be the most common available form of
prevention.''
   Novello said an educational AIDS brochure discussing condom use,
a project begun more than two years ago at the Department of Health
and Human Services, will be released soon. Critics had charged that
conservatives in the department were trying to derail the
publication because it discussed condoms.

   Proposed legislation to end the turf battle
between the federal agencies that oversee the stock markets and the
futures exchanges would combine them into a single Markets and
Trading Commission.
   A bill to merge the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission was introduced Wednesday, but
even supporters concede it faces rough going.
   Meanwhile the chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees
the SEC, proposed a bill to curb abuses in the low cost, high risk
``penny stock'' market.
   The CFTC, which regulates the futures exchanges and the SEC,
which oversees the securities industry, have been squabbling over
which agency has authority to regulate so-called ``hybrid''
financial products with elements of both a security and a futures
contract.
   The new agency would be phased in over a two-year period and one
division would still deal exclusively with physical commodities
such as metals and oil as well as farm products like wheat, pork
bellies and soybeans.
   Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., who cosponsored the bill with Rep.
Dennis E. Eckart, D-Ohio, said the legislation does not seek ``to
create a super SEC or a super CFTC. It is not a takeover of one
agency by the other.''
   The penny stock reform bill by Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass.,
would require that all penny stocks be traded through an automated

<HEAD>Poll: Cholesterol Levels Go Unchecked in Many At Risk for Heart</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Many Americans at risk for heart disease and
heart attack have not had their cholesterol tested, according to a
new survey.
   The Gallup Organization survey released Wednesday by Merck,
Sharp &amp; Dohme, a pharmaceutical company, found that 96 percent of
those with a family history of heart disease agreed they should
have their cholesterol tested, but 42 percent said they had never
done so.
   Among those without a family history of the disease, half said
they have had their cholesterol level tested and half said they had
not.
   High levels of cholesterol in the blood is one of the risk
factors for heart disease, as is a family history of the disease,
which is the leading cause of death in the United States.
   Smoking is also believed to be a factor, and the survey found
that 30 percent of all the men and women with a family history of
heart disease are smokers, compared with 28 percent in the group
without such a history.
   The survey found that many with heart disease in their family
have taken steps in the last year or two to cut down on cholesterol
in their diets.
   Seventy-seven percent said they read labels for fat and
cholesterol content, 88 percent said they are cooking more low-fat
meals, 83 percent said they were eating low-fat dairy products and
86 percent said they were eating more fish and chicken.
   Those with no family history of heart disease were slightly less
likely to be taking such steps _ 71 percent are reading labels, 81
percent are cooking more low-fat meals, 78 percent are eating
low-fat dairy products and 83 percent are eating more fish and
chicken, according to the survey.

<HEAD>Peres Coalition Would Be First Left-Dominated Cabinet Since 1977</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Labor Party leader Shimon Peres says he has put
together a parliamentary majority for a new government, opening the
way for Israel's first left-dominated governing coalition in 13
years.
   Peres on Wednesday night asked Parliament to convene and approve
his new Cabinet on Sunday, saying a major goal of his coalition
would be pursuing U.S.-backed efforts to open Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks.
   He refused to say how he had broken a 60-60 deadlock with the
right-wing Likud bloc of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir in the
120-member legislature.
   ``I have a majority, it doesn't matter which one. ... I have a
majority and hope to enlarge it,'' Peres said on Israel radio.
   The Labor Party leader justified the mystery by saying it was
necessary to crucial negotiations still under way to bring other
small parties into the government.
   Likud leaders immediately cast doubt on Peres' claim of a
majority, meaning the war of nerves in which Likud tries to block
the Labor government will go on until a vote in Parliament.
   ``We can paint the opposite picture,'' said Transport Minister
Moshe Katsav, insisting Likud still had 60 votes. Katsav said Peres
was ``exerting psychological pressure'' to win over wavering
legislators.
   Shamir issued a statement read on television that said only,
``We did what we could to maintain this government. It was a walk
on the brink.''
   Israeli media said the deciding vote was likely to be a defector
from Likud or a religious party. Peres also hinted at this
possibility by defending the idea in a state television interview.
   ``The question is, defector from what?'' Peres asked.``Why for
example should a minister who is for peace be ready to accept the
breakdown of the peace process. Is this not defection?''
   Peres, 66, a former prime minister and strong proponent of a
conciliatory stance toward Palestinians, was asked to form a
government after Shamir's Likud-Labor coalition fell in a
Parliament vote of no confidence March 15.
   The government crisis was triggered by a dispute over U.S.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III's proposals for a
Palestinian-Israeli meeting in Cairo, Egypt.
   Peres was in favor and forced a showdown with Shamir, who was
reluctant to accept Baker's ideas.
   Since then, Labor has tried to bring together conservative
religious parties and its left-wing allies for a coalition
government.
   Peres' fortunes turned Tuesday when the ultra-Orthodox Agudat
Israel signed a coalition agreement, bringing others to the
negotiating table.
   Radio reports said the likely defector was Avraham Sharir, a
member of a disgruntled faction within Likud. Sharir, 58 a former
tourism and justice minister, could not be reached for comment.
Katsav insisted Sharir was not deserting Likud.
   Israeli newspapers said Sharir has been promised the tourism
portfolio in a Peres government. Labor officials refused to comment
on the reports about Sharir.
   The party's secretary general, Micha Harish, suggested Labor had
succeeded in luring other former Likud backers, saying: ``We are
talking about more than 61'' who support Labor.
   Other potential swing votes could come from five lawmakers in
the ultra-Orthodox Torah Guardians party, which helped Peres topple
Shamir's Cabinet.
   The wheeling and dealing among so many tiny parties also carried
an additional complication, as three left-wing parties threatened
in anger to refrain from joining the coalition.
   Amnon Rubinstein of Shinui said the notion of switching back and
forth between political blocs was ``a problem that goes to the very
core of Israeli democracy.''
   In defense Peres noted past examples of political defections,
including the late war hero Moshe Dayan, who switched from Labor to
Likud in 1977 to become foreign minister in former Premier Menachem
Begin's first Cabinet.
   ``I propose that we each examine ourselves and not preach
morality to others,'' Peres said.
   He said his government would be ``based on two principles, the
status quo on religion and secondly the continuation of the peace
process.''
   But Peres could have trouble making bold peace moves with only a
narrow majority in Parliament that includes some conservative
lawmakers.
   His Labor Party dominated Israeli government from the state's
founding in 1948 until Begin's victory in May 1977. The party has
shared power with Likud following two indecisive elections since
1984.

<HEAD>Kansas City School Desegregation Plan Still Being Debated</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite a federal appeals court's
desegregation order, lawyers for schools in Kansas City and its
suburbs are uncertain where more integrated education will result.
   The order issued Monday instructs a federal judge to draw up a
plan for transferring students from mostly black inner-city schools
to the overwhelmingly white suburbs. It orders the state to pay
transportation costs and tuition for the students.
   Individual schools' participation is voluntary. However, if they
refuse there may be further litigation.
   ``It would be a voluntary plan,'' Reg Rowe, a Kansas City School
District spokesman, said this week. ``However, the language is very
firm in the order concerning participation.''
   Attorneys for the Independence, Lee's Summit and North Kansas
City schools said their suburban districts may not be quick to
participate.
   ``If a district will take a thousand kids in the fall, that
would be satisfactory for all concerned,'' said Norman Humphrey, a
lawyer representing the Independence district. ``But I don't know
if any district can or would do that.''
   A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
St. Louis told U.S. District Judge Russell G. Clark on Monday to
draw up and implement the transfer program in line with a
desegregation plan he ordered in 1985.
   The order said the state would have to pay for up to 1,200
transfer students in the 1990-91 school year; 2,400 in 1991-92;
3,600 in 1992-93; 4,800 in 1993-94, and 6,000 in 1994-95.
   ``I think 1,200 is a very realistic number for the first year
and another 1,200 for the next year,'' said Arthur A. Benson II, an
attorney for the plaintiffs in the case, who include the Kansas
City school district. ``We have surveyed the black kids, and they
want to volunteer.''
   Humphrey said the plan might enjoy the limited success of the
Kansas City District's magnet school program, also formulated under
the 1985 desegregation plan. The magnet schools have drawn about
720 mostly white students from suburban or private schools to the
inner-city schools.
   The Kansas City district's enrollment of 34,500 students is
about 68 percent black.
   In its ruling, the appeals panel also reinstated a
discrimination lawsuit against the Independence, Lee's Summit and
North Kansas City districts.
   The suit was filed in 1988 by Kansas City black students who
applied unsuccessfully to the three suburban districts. The lawsuit
had been dismissed by a federal court.
   The appeals ruling put the discrimination case on hold to give
the suburban schools time to accept the voluntary desegregation
plan.

<HEAD>Plane Crash Being Investigated as Murder-Suicide</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The fiery crash of a small plane may have
been caused by a struggle for control of the aircraft by a
passenger dying of brain cancer and bent on suicide, investigators
say.
   ``We thought we were investigating an air accident, and it has
turned into something else,'' police spokesman David Grimm said
Wednesday.
   The twin-engine plane plowed into a Boulder neighborhood Sunday,
setting a house and garages ablaze and killing pilot James Wilford
``Bill'' Layne, 56, of Aurora and his passenger, Gordon Larry Hood,
45, of Atlanta, authorities said.
   Grimm said out-of-state acquaintances of Hood's said he had
discussed plans to commit suicide by way of a fiery plane crash
over Colorado because of terminal cancer.
   Witnesses on Sunday said the airplane was flying erratically,
then flipped on its side and dove to the ground. It was as if a
struggle was going on for control of the craft, authorities said.
   ``Was the pilot overpowered, was the pilot shot, was the pilot
stabbed? We just don't know,'' said Grimm. ``As far as we can tell
right now, the pilot just happens to be the unfortunate person who
got hired that day.''
   Ruth Loftus of Indianapolis said in a telephone interview
Wednesday that she met Hood in Indianapolis in December and that he
told her about a diagnosis of brain cancer and his plans to hire a
Colorado plane and ``hit the pilot over the head.''
   Loftus, 32, said Hood told her the cancer was ``eating him
alive'' but would not be detectable because his body would be
burned badly in the crash, enabling his friends to collect
insurance benefits.
   ``I tried to talk him out of it. He said he felt sorry for me.
He wanted to leave me as one of his beneficiaries,'' she said. She
said tried to call the FBI and other law enforcement agencies ``but
nobody would do anything. I gave up on it.''
   Investigators said one clue that remains to be checked is the
mail Hood apparently dropped off in Granby an hour before the crash.
   Granby cab driver Pete Gallo said he drove Hood around Granby
for a while Sunday, including three stops by the post office, each
time to mail a package or letter.
   Layne worked for Intensive Air Care, a Denver charter company,
and had taken Hood to Granby, about 80 miles from Denver. The crash
happened on the return trip.
   Autopsies showed Hood and Layne died of injuries suffered in the
crash and not from other causes, said Tom Faure, chief medical
investigator of the Boulder County coroner's office.
   Police returned to the crash site Wednesday to look for a weapon
or other evidence that would support the murder-suicide theory.
   The Cessna 421 Golden Eagle streaked over the foothills west of
Boulder, slammed into a tree and destroyed a vacant house, four
garages and six parked cars, engulfing a large section of the block
in flames.

   The Iowa House has approved what would
be the nation's first statewide ban on food packaging made of
polystyrene foam. But the measure was given little chance of
success in the Senate.
   The ban was adopted 49-46 Wednesday night. It was contained in a
bill to earmark $400 million in state lottery profits for
environmental programs over the next decade.
   Polystyrene foam containers are widely used in the fast-food
industry in cups and hamburger boxes. Environmentalists say the
tough, flexible plastic takes generations to break down, is not
easily recyclable, takes up too much landfill space and causes
litter.
   Environmentalist legislators were jubilant over Wednesday's
vote, but some conceded the provision may eventually face
rejection. The Senate is considered more conservative than the
House.
   ``It's not going to cause major disruption in our lives and we
still can't work up the courage to do it,'' said Rep. Darrell
Hanson.
   The ban would become effective in 1991. Violations would be
punishable by a $100 fine.
   ``It's one of the most environmentally conscious things the
General Assembly has done in decades,'' said Rep. Dennis Black.
   More than a dozen cities and counties nationwide have enacted
bans on polystyrene foam, a tough, flexible plastic. Also, a
bipartisan group of congressmen has asked for the removal of such
foam cups from congressional restaurants.

   A state House subcommittee approved a
bill that would make it illegal for newspapers to publish unsigned
editorials and force editorial writers to disclose financial
holdings.
   A subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee approved the
measure 4-3 Wednesday, sending it to the full committee.
   The bill would require editorial board members to file financial
disclosure forms or face fines of up to $5,000.
   It would make it a misdemeanor for a newspaper to run an
editorial not signed by the author.
   The measure clearly infringes on the First Amendment and would
never stand up in court, said Barry Richard, attorney for the
Florida Press Association.
   One of the 32 co-sponsors of the bill, Democrat Elvin Martinez,
said the measure's intent was to shed more light on newspapers'
role as opinion leaders.
   ``The real molder of public opinion is the press,'' Martinez
said. ``They can take you and beat you and do anything to you, and
they're immune. I think people have a right to know if their views
are jaundiced by some financial interest.''

<DATELINE>KALAPANA, Hawaii (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Creeping like a fiery dragon, lava from
Kilauea Volcano vaporized two houses and oozed toward four others
in a rural subdivision on Hawaii Island.
   Loren Lewisohn watched helplessly Wednesday as the lava advanced
and ignited the house he had built in the Kalapana Gardens
subdivision.
   ``If the lava takes away the house, nothing can take away the
experience of building it,'' said Lewisohn, whose insurance made it
easier to be philosophical. ``I'm gaining a lot of respect for the
awesome force of nature.''
   Lava crept around a support pillar and set fire to the
latticework. An hour later, all that was left of Lewisohn's house
were the twisted remains of its corrugated metal roof. Earlier, a
house owned by John and Ruth Duff erupted in flames after the
molten rock surged beneath the raised structure.
   Kilauea Volcano has wiped out 78 residences since it began
erupting more than seven years ago. The wooden houses incinerated
Wednesday were the first Kalapana-area homes destroyed by lava
since December 1986.
   Residents of 59 homes have been ordered to evacuate. Civil
defense officials said all residents of the 125-home coastal
community should be ready to pack their belongings within 72 hours.
   The flow had entered the community on Tuesday from the west,
passing within several feet of two homes. Those homes remained
standing Wednesday when the lava flowed into a gulley and toward
the Duff home.
   Ed Torrison, whose house was just 20 feet from molten rock that
was filling his back yard, expected to be next.
   ``It's a shame to watch this sort of thing happen, but it's kind
of exciting, too,'' he said.
   Torrison said he was going to watch the flow from his balcony
until the last possible minute and take pictures as his home
burned. ``I've got 12 shots left,'' he said.
   The flow on the west side of the subdivision had split into two
fingers Tuesday night before merging Wednesday to move down a
street along the subdivison's western edge.
   ``It's just finding low spots,'' said Reggie Okamura, a
geologist with the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. ``It's like water.
It will seek the quickest route downhill.''
   Okamura said the flow probably would meander in the subdivision
because it is a relatively level area. Kim said the flow had no
direct path toward the ocean without cutting through populated
areas.

<TEXT>
   Peruvians vote Sunday for the next president
of their violence-torn, inflation-wracked nation. Opinion polls say
their choice will be Mario Vargas Llosa, one of the world's most
celebrated novelists.
   Apparently, the only question is whether Vargas Llosa, 54, will
fall short of a majority. That would force him into a runoff
against one of the eight other candidates trailing far behind him
in opinion polls.
   Regardless of whether a second round is necessary, most
pollsters predict the novelist will be writing the next five years
of Peruvian history as successor to populist President Alan Garcia.
   Vargas Llosa addressed at least 50,000 screaming supporters in
front of Lima's Palace of Justice on Wednesday night, promising to
``do away with inflation and bring peace to the country.''
   He said he would ``make Peru again a country of high culture and
civilization.''
   The latest published surveys show Vargas Llosa, candidate of the
center-right Democratic Front coalition, with support of around 45
percent _ more than twice that of his nearest competitor, Luis Alva
Castro of the left-of-center governing Aprista party.
   The constitution requires a runoff between the top two
vote-getters if no candidate gets more than 50 percent.
   Nearly 10 million people are registered to vote. Voting is
obligatory and violators face stiff penalties, including fines
equivalent to nearly half the minimum wage of $45 a month.
   In addition to voting for president and two vice presidents,
Peruvians will fill all of the Senate's 60 seats and Congress' 180
seats.
   But violence has marred the campaign and threatens to overshadow
the election. Guerrillas of the Maoist-inspired Shining Path have
mounted a bombing and assassination campaign to try to thwart it
and say they will launch election-day ``armed strikes.''
   More than 18,000 people have been killed as a result of the
10-year-old insurgency, the governnment says. Half the country is
under emergency rule because of the leftist rebels.
   Vargas Llosa entered politics reluctantly in 1987 after leading
a huge public rally against Garcia's plan to nationalize Peru's
banks. He advocates free-market policies and foreign investment,
and promises to apply economic shock treatment to Peru's ravaged
economy.
   Backed by a well-heeled publicity campaign, Vargas Llosa enjoyed
55 percent support as recently as mid-February. But his lead has
slipped largely due to late surges by Alva Castro and independent
candidate Alberto Fujimori.
   Fujimori, former rector of the National University of
Agriculture, was virtually unknown until two months ago. Pollsters
say his appeal stems from voters' mistrust of professional
politicians.
   People planning to vote for Fujimori say they distrust the
traditional conservative parties supporting Vargas Llosa, a
political independent.
   Alva Castro, 48, became finance minister when Garcia was elected
in 1985. He stuck with Garcia through the glory years of 1985-1987,
when Peru had the fastest-growing economy in South America.
   But the free-spending policies that paid for the boom also
brought the bust. Alva Castro quit, say critics, when he realized
the economy was running out of steam.
   Last year, Peru suffered nearly 3,000 percent inflation. In the
last two years the economy has shrunk by 20 percent.
   ``The decline in my party's government weighs on the campaign,''
Alva Castro admitted recently. But he promised ``to correct the
errors that have been committed.''
   Alva Castro's campaign has benefitted from an eleventh-hour
spending spree by the Garcia government, which has used up much of
the treasury's remaining reserves to subsidize basic services and
hold down inflation.
   Many believe the 40-year-old Garcia wants to position himself
for the 1995 race, and is trying to boost his image before he goes
out. He is prohibited by the constitution from seeking a
consecutive term.
   If necessary, a runoff would probably be held in early June. The
exact date depends on how soon results are known from the first
round.
   Ballots trickled in for weeks following the 1985 election due to
poor communications with much of the country's interior. Official
results were not released for nearly two months.
   A major concern for the Democratic Front coalition is whether it
can win a majority in the Congress. Without it, Vargas Llosa will
have difficulty imposing the economic austeriy measures he says are
necessary.
   The latest surveys show 10 percent of voters remain undecided,
and the candidates have been campaigning hard to win those votes in
the final days.
   One day recently, Vargas Llosa campaigned in a Lima slum,
addressed two rallies in different cities in the Andes, then flew
to Trujillo, 350 miles up the coast.
   Owing to constant threats by leftist guerrillas, the candidates
often appear with little advance notice, flying in and out of
provincial towns quickly so the rebels can't plan an attack.
   The tactic often leaves voters equally surprised.
   ``They come and they go,'' said shopkeeper Rosa Casa during a
recent Vargas Llosa rally in Chincha, 125 miles southeast of Lima.
   ``They've all been here. But Chincha still doesn't have water.
Chincha still doesn't have electricity. Nothing's going to
change,'' said Ms. Casa.
   She said she had not decided which candidate would get her vote.

<HEAD>Suspicious Fire Destroys Bus at Greyhound Garage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A suspicious fire destroyed a bus in a Greyhound
garage whose door had been welded shut, authorities said. The blaze
came after the company and its striking drivers blamed each other
for violence during the walkout.
   Greyhound Lines spokesman Kevin Fry said today a flare found on
a bus in the service garage by federal Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms investigators apparently caused Wednesday night's blaze,
which he characterized as arson.
   District Fire Chief Robert Dillon said the fire was ``of a
suspicious nature.''
   No one was injured in the blaze, which burned about 45 minutes.
   The fire was one of the most serious instances of damage during
the monthlong strike by 6,300 drivers.
   ``We will continue to operate as we have in the past,'' Fry
said. ``We will not give into acts of terrorism. We will just
continue to operate. Period.''
   When firemen tried to open the garage's large overhead door to
get at the fire, they found it welded shut, said fire dispatcher
Frank Fell. Firefighters had to cut through the metal door to the
300-by-150-foot brick garage, Dillon said.
   Fry said a padlock was missing from the door and the lights of
several of the buses were on when firemen arrived. He said 13
Trailways buses were in the garage. Dallas-based Greyhound owns
Trailways.
   Fry had no estimate of damage to the bus and garage.
   Earlier Wednesday, Greyhound Vice President P. Anthony Lannie
called on the union to send officers to monitor pickets and
withhold benefits from members who take part in violence.
   ``Certainly, mere pious assertions unsupported by visible signs
of union condemnation of illegal conduct cannot serve to relieve
the union of its legal and moral responsibility,'' Lannie said in a
letter to the union.
   A union spokesman repeated its condemnation of the violence but
criticized Greyhound for refusing to negotiate until a week passes
without shots being fired at one of its buses or garages.
   ``There's no way, in my view, that either the company or the
union can control these crazies,'' said union spokesman Nick
Nichols.
   ``What they've done is turn this whole process ... over to some
crazy on the road who likes to take potshots at buses,'' he said of
Greyhound.
   Greyhound has reported 31 shootings, including 26 at buses, 70
bomb threats and more than 100 other incidents of violence since
the strike began March 2.
   The union says about 60 pickets have been targets of violence. A
striker in Redding, Calif., was crushed to death March 3 by a bus
driven by a replacement.
   In an effort to recapture business in the key Northeast
corridor, Greyhound on Wednesday offered free bus trips through
Easter to passengers who don't reach their destination within 15
minutes of the scheduled arrival time.
   Passengers will get a coupon good for a free round trip on the
same route.
   Meanwhile, a judge in New York City barred the company from
hiring ``strikebreakers.'' Greyhound said it would appeal.
   Greyhound's drivers and about 3,000 of its office and
maintenance workers walked out over wages and job security. The
company has operated on a reduced schedule since, using
replacements and union members who cross picket lines.
   Greyhound operates the only nationwide bus system.

<HEAD>1,000 Rally for Museum Running Mapplethorpe Exhibit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 1,000 people rallied in support of a
museum threatened with prosecution for running a photography
exhibit deemed smut by the city's conservative lawmen.
   The Contemporary Arts Center is awaiting a court hearing Friday
on the artistic merit of the photos by the late Robert
Mapplethorpe, whose work last year led Congress to restrict arts
funding.
   The private museum's supporters carried signs declaring the city
``Censornati'' at the rally Wednesday. Museum curator Jack Sawyer
wore a ``Censorship is Obscene'' T-shirt over his suit.
   Police Chief Larry Whalen, claiming nine of the 175 photographs
in the show are obscene, said authorities haven't decided whether
to file charges against the center when the exhibit opens Friday.
It is scheduled to run for six weeks.
   Opponents of the show, including an anti-pornography group, said
the Arts Center would affront Cincinnati's moral standards by
exhibiting the photos, which include some graphic depictions of
homosexuality and sadomasochism, as well as nude children.
   After Whalen and Sheriff Simon Leis Jr. threatened to close the
show, the Arts Center sued to get a jury verdict on whether the
exhibition violates community standards.
   On Wednesday, the center's lawyers asked for a judgment without
trial. They said the entire exhibit was constitutionally protected
because it is legitimate art that already has been shown in
Philadelphia, Washington and other cities.
   The Mapplethorpe pictures led Congress last year to limit
federal support for the arts after Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
labeled them obscene. Mapplethorpe died of AIDS a year ago.
   At the rally, Clyde Jeffries, a bartender and a member of
Citizens Against Artistic Censorship, gathered signatures on a
petition to the city government protesting police involvement in
the case.
   ``It's not so much the exhibit. It's that we don't want a few
select individuals in the city telling us what we can do,''
Jeffries said. ``This has gone on too long. It's embarrassing.''
   Cincinnati authorities are among the strictest in the nation in
enforcing anti-pornography codes. They have closed all of the
city's adult bookstores and movie theaters.
   The Arts Center's director, Dennis Barrie, said the museum
expects to sell more than 3,000 tickets for the first night of the
exhibit.

<HEAD>Tiananmen Square Closed Second Time, Blocking Protests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police cordoned off Tiananmen Square today, a
holiday honoring the dead, in an apparent bid to block any attempt
to mourn protesters killed in June when the military crushed the
pro-democracy movement.
   On the nearly deserted 100-acre square, authorized groups of
flag-waving schoolchildren joined soldiers for rites marking the
annual holiday, Chingming.
   It was the second time in a week that police kept the general
public off the square, the focal point of the student-led
pro-democracy movement and the country's symbolic center of power.
   Police guards stood at 30-foot intervals around the perimeter,
police vans and jeeps were parked at strategic points and dozens of
police with walkie-talkies patrolled adjacent streets.
   Overseas dissidents had called on Beijing students to ``stroll''
through the square on Chingming in a silent memorial to the
hundreds of people killed when troops stormed the city June 3-4 to
drive thousands of pro-democracy students from Tiananmen.
   A similar appeal to walk through the square on Sunday was
blocked when authorities closed it to the public, on that occasion
for ceremonies to promote support for the Asian Games to be held in
Beijing next fall.
   Beijing schools and factories warned young people to stay away
from Tiananmen and advised them against wearing black armbands or
the traditional white mourning flower on Chingming.
   The city also issued orders forbidding group memorial activities
unless authorities granted permission.
   Some students said they wanted to go to Tiananmen, but others
said they were fearful of potential repercussions and would stay
away.
   On the square today, children wearing the yellow caps of the
Young Pioneers, a youth group that gives ideological training,
participated in ceremonies around the monument to revolutionary
martyrs.
   Red banners on the monument called on people to honor the
Chinese revolution and to ``raise our Chinese spirit.''
   Multicolored flags around the square gave it a festive look, but
police yelled at foreigners who tried to take photographs.
   Premier Li Peng, asked at a news conference Wednesday about
tightened security around the square, said Tiananmen is the symbol
of Beijing and China and that it was ``quite normal'' for police
``to take all necessary measures to preserve order'' there.

   A bomb set by Shining Path guerrillas exploded
during a presidential campaign rally in the northern coastal city
of Trujillo, and two children were badly wounded, police said.
   Police also reported seven other bombings in the country, and
two people were killed and 10 wounded in one incident.
   Authorities say the attacks were part of the Maoist-inspired
guerrilla group's campaign to sabotage Sunday's general elections.
   Police said they arrested a woman after the blast Wednesday near
the central plaza of Trujillo, 350 miles north of Lima.
   Luis Alva Castro, presidential candidate of the governing
Aprista Party, was speaking at the rally and asked for calm after
the explosion. Some minutes later, he resumed his speech to the
large crowd gathered in the plaza.
   The injured children were 8 and 12 years old, police said.
   In Junin state, the army said it will extend a day-old curfew
after Shining Path rebels blew up a bus in La Oroya, 95 miles east
of Lima. Two passengers were killed and 10 wounded in the attack.
   Guerrillas also bombed the homes of two congressional candidates
in Huancayo, 120 miles east of the capital, police said.
   No one was hurt in the blasts, which police said were aimed at
the candidates of President Alan Garcia's center-left Aprista Party
and the right-of-center Democratic Front coalition.
   In other attacks near Huancayo, rebels bombed a highway bridge
and blew up a section of railway, police said.
   In Huaraz, in the Andes 190 miles north of Lima, the guerrillas
bombed buildings housing the local offices of the national Food
Board, police said. Two other bombs exploded simultaneously in the
city but caused no damage.
   Police said the Shining Path had called an ``armed strike'' for
this weekend in the towns along the eastern side of the Cordillera
Blanca mountain range in Ancash province.
   The rebel group previously called ``armed strikes'' in the
provinces of Junin and Ayacucho and in Lima in an attempt to
sabotage the general elections. The term ``armed strike'' carries
the threat of death for anyone who defies the call.
   The Shining Path launched its armed insurgency against Peru's
elected governments in 1980. The government says more than 18,000
people have died in the violence.

   A woman who owes the city $171,746 in unpaid
parking tickets has vanished without a trace after accumulating an
average of 2{ parking tickets a day over a 38-month period,
officials say.
   Records from the Parking Violations Bureau show that Silvia
Matos racked up 2,800 tickets between Dec. 31, 1984, and Feb. 28,
1988.
   Despite intensive credit checks and efforts to track her down,
collection agents have yet to pocket a penny from the elusive Ms.
Matos, said PVB director Tom McEnery. ``It's a cold trail,'' he
said.
   Matos, an apparent whiz at navigating Big Apple bureaucracy,
eluded authorities by registering her car under 19 addresses and 36
license plates, the New York Post reported today.
   A 1988 law allows the state Department of Motor Vehicles to
suspend the registration of anyone with 25 or more unanswered
tickets.

   A judge has refused to order a reunion of two
young brothers separated by their adoptive parents.
   Juvenile Court Judge Arthur N. Hamilton on Wednesday declined to
order the parents to allow an 11-year-old returned to state custody
last year to visit his 8-year-old brother, still with the adoptive
parents.
   Hamilton instead transferred the request to the Circuit Court's
chancery division, which he said was the more appropriate forum.
   Cook County Public Guardian Patrick Murphy had sued to let the
boys see each other. He said they had been apart since the
11-year-old went to a group home just before Thanksgiving. The
lawsuit also seeks $50,000 in damages for the older boy.
   The boys were adopted in 1984. The lawsuit says the parents,
called Joseph and Pamela Doe, returned the older boy to state
custody because he hadn't ``bonded'' well with them.

   Government scientists, who a week ago
announced that a study found no link between Agent Orange exposure
and a rare form of cancer among Vietnam veterans, say the herbicide
cannot be ruled out, either.
   The chief investigator for the Selected Cancers Study said
Wednesday that the findings don't eliminate an Agent Orange
connection.
   ``The study does not rule out that Agent Orange may cause
cancer,'' Dr. Edward Brann of the Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta told the House Veterans Affairs Committee.
   Asked about this afterward, Brann added: ``Agent Orange may
cause cancer. We don't know from this study.''
   In a summary of the study released last week, CDC said: ``We
found no evidence that the increased risk of NHL (non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma) might be related to exposure to Agent Orange in Vietnam.''
   The summary noted the study's determination that sailors with
the least exposure to Agent Orange were more prone than ground
troops to get the disease, and that veterans from the region that
included the area of highest use of the herbicide had a lower risk.
   ``These data, along with evidence from other studies regarding
the likelihood of Vietnam veterans' exposure to Agent Orange, make
it quite unlikely that the increased risk of NHL among Vietnam
veterans results from exposure to herbicides,'' it added.
   Brann and CDC Director William L. Roper told lawmakers that the
study must be seen in the light of other scientific research.
   Still, members of the panel questioned the reliability of the
study in the 12-year-old debate over Agent Orange. Brann himself
said he did not approve of one major question veterans were asked
to determine whether they had been exposed to the herbicide, which
was sprayed on jungle areas in Vietnam to deny cover to the enemy.
   Veterans were asked if they had been in defoliated areas.
   Interpretations of the CDC study by scientists, veterans
organizations and the Department of Veterans Affairs have varied
widely because the new report looked only obliquely at Agent Orange
exposure.
   The original intent of the study was to look at Agent Orange and
its relationship to various cancers on the assumption that 25
percent of Vietnam veterans were exposed to the herbicide.
   CDC later changed course, however, deciding that the ``results
of several studies'' make the premise of 25 percent exposure
``unlikely.''
   The study found a 50 percent higher risk of non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma in all Vietnam veterans compared with the overall male
population, but no significantly higher risk for five other
cancers. The VA last week decided to award disability payments to
those veterans as a result.
   Agent Orange were sprayed in Vietnam from 1965 to 1970,
according to the VA. The herbicide has two active phenoxy
ingredients, but the prime suspect is another ingredient, dioxin,
with which it was contaminated.
   Dioxin is known to cause cancer in laboratory animals.
   More than 36,000 of the nation's 2.6 million Vietnam veterans
have requested benefits based on claims they suffered diseases
attributable to Agent Orange. Only three of those veterans have
been granted disability payments _ for a skin condition known as
chloracne.
   Roper said the Air Force's ``Ranch Hand'' study of the people
who flew the Agent Orange spraying operations and handled the
barrels of the herbicide puts the new study in the right
perspective.
   He said the men in that study were known to have been exposed to
dioxin, yet have not developed cancers.
   But Rep. Douglas Applegate, D-Ohio, said that study ignored the
ground troops who ``ate, breathed, drank and sometimes slept in
Agent Orange.''

<HEAD>Hong Kong Reacts to Basic Law, Nationality Package</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WONG SAU-YING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite China's ratification of a new
constitution for Hong Kong, the territory appeared more interested
today in the unveiling of a proposal to allow 50,000 households to
emigrate to Britain.
   The British government on Wednesday announced details of the
plan, which paves the way for an estimated 225,000 Hong Kong
Chinese living in its colony to be granted the right to live in
Britain.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has supported the plan by
saying Britian has a ``solemn duty'' to the colony before it
reverts to Chinese rule in 1997. But the proposal faces stiff
opposition and possibly defeat in Parliament.
   Its unveiling grabbed more media attention in Hong Kong than the
Chinese legislature's vote Wednesday to approve the Basic Law by
which Beijing will govern the territory after the change in
sovereignty.
   While the final draft of the Basic Law was reached several weeks
ago, details of the nationality package were previously unknown.
   The intense interest in the emigration proposal also seems to
indicate residents are increasingly looking to a future outside of
the territory once it becomes part of Communist China.
   The respected Ming Pao Daily News ran the entire text of the
emigration selection procedure on its front page, and some
newspapers included tables that explained the point system under
which passports would be alloted to people holding key positions in
Hong Kong.
   The plan ``would go some way to alleviating Hong Kong's
emigration problem by giving key people confidence to stay in Hong
Kong,'' the Hong Kong government said in a statement. Officials
estimate about 1,000 people emigrate each week, including many of
the colony's best educated.
   The legislature's Special Working Group on Nationality issued a
statement expressing disappointment over the limited scope of the
package. But it also acknowledged that ``any measure designed to
encourage people to remain in Hong Kong would go some way toward
reducing the brain drain.''
   It added that London had ``the moral responsibility to provide a
safe and secure future for the entire population of Hong Kong.''
   Several newspapers also commented on the Basic Law, which is
designed to guarantee that the territory can maintain its
capitalist system for 50 years and enjoy a ``high degree of
autonomy'' after 1997.
   The constitution has been widely criticized for not being
democratic enough and for an anti-subversion clause that is viewed
as a means for Beijing to assert political control over the
territory.
   ``Hong Kong people have not been that enthusiastic in the Basic
Law from the very beginning. Its promulgation just marks the end of
the drafting era,'' an editorital in the Chinese-language Hong Kong
Economic Journal said.
   The Sing Po Daily News said in an editorial that it was ``barely
acceptable.''
   Political commentator Lo Chi-kin said the final promulgation of
the law had little impact on the colony.
   ``The whole process of the drafting work ... reflected that the
Chinese leaders were not prepared to give way to a general call for
greater democracy here,'' he said. ``People here believe that it is
futile to speak on the Basic Law as Beijing has the final say
anyway.''
   The colony's Legislature, which functions primarily as a
debating forum on public issues, on Wednesday urged China to make
the law more democratic.
   The new constitution provides for a 60-seat legislature in which
one-half of the members would be directly elected by the year 2003.
It also sets up a complicated voting system that gives appointed
legislators power to veto controversial bills.

   A mother persuaded Gerber Products Co. to resume
production of a line of baby formula for one customer _ her
severely handicapped son.
   ``We feel (it) is morally and ethically correct'' to make the
product for Raymond Dunn Jr., a retarded 15-year-old allergic to
almost everything except Gerber's meat-based brown liquid formula,
George Puvis, a Gerber vice president, said in Thursday's New York
Post.
   Gerber also said it will provide the formula for free to the boy.
   Raymond was born with an abnormally small brain and weighs only
31 pounds. His mother, Carol Dunn of Yankee Lake, in the state's
Catskills region, had campaigned for five years to assure the boy's
food source.
   In 1984, Gerber announced it would stop making the formula
because of reduced demand but sent Dunn its stockpile, which she
said would have run out in June. After much pleading from Dunn,
Gerber agreed to resume production.

   Hollywood loved the twisted tale of the
Totos, that fun couple whose murderous marriage came to light in
1983.
   Boy meets girl; boy marries girl. Husband fools around; wife
tries to kill him. Wife does time; husband takes her back.
   ``I Love You To Death,'' the film based on the Totos' tale,
premieres today; a non-fiction book subtitled ``The True Story''
will be in bookstores soon; and Fran and Tony Toto, in their 25th
year of marriage, are making the rounds of talk shows to be asked
how can they still be together after no fewer than five botched
attempts on Tony's life.
   A trip-wire at the top of the porch steps failed to trip him as
he stepped out. A boy waiting in the bushes with a baseball bat ran
off. A wire rigged to Tony's car's gasoline tank failed to spark an
explosion. A gunshot to the head failed to kill him. A gunshot to
the chest missed his heart; sleeping pills merely slowed his
metabolism and helped him survive.
   The movie couple, Kevin Kline and Tracey Ullman, play the story
for laughs, a black comedy with a happy ending.
   The story ``was amazing to me,'' said director Lawrence Kasdan,
whose movies include ``Body Heat'' and ``The Big Chill.'' ``It made
me laugh, and the way it ended touched me. The guy was so full of
life that you couldn't kill him, and their love was so strong that
you couldn't kill that.''
   The truth is remarkably similar to the script, but with some
crucial differences _ for instance, in real life there was no
mother-in-law instigator.
   The happy ending is true. Last week, Fran Toto, 46, sat in her
living room, bouncing her second grandson on her lap, watching a TV
show about the movie and giggling at William Hurt and Keanu Reeves
playing drug-addled amateur hit men.
   ``The way we can laugh about it now is so that we don't get
crazy,'' she explained. The reality, she said, was ``very scary.''
   In the same house, in 1983, Fran was talking to real-life
amateur hit men about how to get rid of Tony's body. He had just
been shot in the heart _ or so they thought until he walked into
the room.
   ``What's going on?'' Tony asked the startled conspirators.
   That's what the cops wanted to know, too. Two days later police,
tipped off about the strange goings-on at the house, went inside,
hustled Tony off to the hospital and arrested Fran.
   She pleaded guilty to solicitation to commit murder and reckless
endangerment and served four years in prison. Anthony Bruno, a
young man who worked at the Totos' pizza shop, pleaded guilty and
went to prison, as did druggie cousins Ronald and Donald Barlips.
   Tony spent 12 days in the hospital, then bailed out his wife. He
had lived to forgive.
   ``I was the bad guy, I made a mistake,'' said Tony, 44, who says
his adultery was astonishingly frequent. ``I did not deserve to get
shot, of course.
   ``It was not my time to go. God gave me another chance to live.
After 12 days, I walk _ miraculous, I walk. Nothing wrong with me,
thank God. Now what do I do now? Walk away from my family and say
forget about it? No, no, no, no. If I could bring my family back
together, I'm gonna try. And now we're happy.''
   For her part, Fran said, ``I don't even really think I really
deep down wanted to kill him. It was something that just happened.''
   ``The moral is to be faithful,'' said Tony, who still carries a
.25-caliber slug in his skull. ``Don't cheat on your spouse, be
honest with each other, and learn to communicate with each other.''
   ``I think we'll save a lot of marriages.''

<TEXT>
   Edward Carlson, who worked his way from bellhop
to the chairman of hotel and airline chain UAL Inc., has died of
cancer at age 78.
   Carlson, who died Tuesday night in a Seattle hospital, was among
Seattle's best-known civic boosters and was credited with the idea
for the city's trademark Space Needle, built for the 1962 World's
Fair. The idea came from a revolving hotel Carlson saw in
Stuttgart, West Germany.
   He joined UAL Inc. in August 1970, when United Airlines merged
with Western International Hotels, now Westin Hotels. Carlson had
headed the hotel chain since 1960.
   He retired as UAL's chief executive officer in 1979 and as
chairman in 1982. He retired altogether in 1983, after a year as
chairman of the executive committee of UAL.
   Carlson was born in Tacoma on June 4, 1911, and moved with his
divorced mother and sister to Seattle after completing grade school.
   He entered the hotel business in 1928, working part-time as a
bellhop at the Benjamin Franklin Hotel in Seattle while studying at
the University of Washington.
   In 1946 he became the assistant to the president of Western
Hotels, then a regional hotel chain based in Seattle.

<HEAD>Government Proposes Outlawing Capital Punishment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said today that it would
introduce legislation to outlaw capital punishment, which has not
been carried out in Ireland since 1954.
   Abolishing the death penalty was an element of a coalition deal
between the Fianna Fail Party and the small Progressive Democrats
party that allowed Prime Minister Charles Haughey to form a
government after elections last summer.
   Current Irish law provides for the death sentence for treason
and for the murder of a member of the government, a diplomat, a
foreign head of state, or a police or prison officer on duty.
   The proposed legislation would prescribe a mandatory sentence of
40 years for those offenses, with a possibility of release after 26
years and eight months. Attempted murder of a policeman or prison
officer would carry a mandatory sentence of 20 years.
   The bill, published today, will be introduced in Parliament when
it reconvenes April 25. It is expected to pass overwhelmingly.
   ``The government is satisfied that the death penalty should now
be finally removed from the statute book and be replaced for
treason and capital murder by a realistic custodial penalty which
will reflect the particularly heinous and serious nature of these
offences and act as a deterrent,'' said Justice Minister Ray Burke.
   The last person executed in Ireland was Michael Manning, who was
hanged for the murder of a 65-year-old woman.
   Twelve policemen have been murdered on duty since 1970. Although
some convicts in those cases were sentenced to death, their
sentences were commuted to 40 years in prison.

<HEAD>Milwaukee Alderman Holds Rally to Organize Black Militia</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A black alderman's proposal to create a new
Black Panther organization drew an estimated 300 people to a public
meeting, where uniformed men guarded doors and kept some white
visitors from entering.
   Alderman Michael McGee carried a slingshot in a pistol holster
at his waist as he told a cheering, predominantly black audience
Wednesday night that he didn't want to have to use violence to get
society to acknowledge the economic needs of the inner-city poor.
   The meeting, on the 22nd anniversary of the murder of Martin
Luther King Jr., was the first held by McGee. Earlier this year he
proposed assembling a militia, modeled and named after the Black
Panthers, to enforce his demands for jobs for blacks.
   The Black Panthers was founded in Oakland, Calif., in the late
1960s as a radical self-help and self-defense organization. It
spread to other cities before desintegrating because of arrests,
violent deaths and manipulation by police and FBI agents.
   Mayor John O. Norquist has accused McGee of encouraging street
violence and said he should resign from the Common Council if he
continues to do so.
   A small group demonstrated outside the elementary school
gymnasium during the meeting.
   McGee and several men at the meeting wore visored caps and
dark-colored uniforms with yellow patches displaying roaring
panthers on the shoulder.
   ``We are going to fight crime first,'' McGee said. People ``may
not listen to the cops but they'll listen to us.''
   ``This is the weapon I'll use,'' he said, pulling the slingshot
from his holster.
   White people attempting to enter the gymnasium were questioned
by door guards. A white Milwaukee Sentinel reporter was denied
admission but black reporters from the Sentinel and The New York
Times, and a white radio station reporter, were admitted.
   John J. Peterburs, public schools business manager, said McGee
was allowed to use the gymnasium with the understanding it would be
open to the public. Officials said McGee wouldn't be allowed the
privilege a second time.

<HEAD>Medical Experts Skeptical of Interferon Results in AIDS Patients</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHIP BROWN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Medical experts expressed skepticism about
reports that a licensed drug alleviated AIDS patients' symptoms
after it was prepared in a novel way.
   Researchers said data is too inconclusive to embrace the results
reported on Wednesday by Dr. Joseph M. Cummins, head of the
Amarillo Cell Culture Co. Inc.
   Cummins said that alpha interferon given to patients in a wafer
form in small amounts ``has reduced the symptoms of a person
suffering from AIDS.''
   A veterinarian, Cummins said he began experiments with
interferon to treat illnesses in cattle. He offered a pure form of
the drug to Dr. Davy K. Koech, the director of the Kenyan Medical
Research Institute in Nairobi, for use on AIDS patients.
   ``Dr. Koech was desperate enough to try something new,'' Cummins
said Wednesday. ``And he is reporting positive results with every
patient he has treated.''
   In the current issue of Biotechnology Newswatch, Koech reported
that within days of taking oral alpha interferon all of his 99 AIDS
patients in the test group developed an appetite. Fever, diarrhea
and fungal infections and other symptoms subsided, the report said.
   Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, head of the National Institutes of Allergy
and Infectious Disease in Bethesda, Md., said Wednesday the results
from Africa were ``astounding and very difficult to believe,'' but
``you have to keep an open mind.''
   Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of the Health Research Group in
Washington, D.C., said there is not enough data on the tests to
make an opinion.
   Cummins agreed that more tests need to be done.
   ``People don't have to believe it, but let's test it,'' he said.
``We need to see if it's a true and natural way to treat AIDS.''
   Koech's research showed interferon led to a significant increase
in the number of CD4 lymphocytes, the white blood cell destroyed by
the HIV virus, which causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Alpha interferon has been scrutinized for its antiviral activity
since its discovery more than 30 years ago.
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved alpha
interferon to treat Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer that occurs commonly
among people with AIDS. But the drug has not generally been tested
in pill form because of the belief it would be destroyed by stomach
acid.
   Koech prepared the drug in wafer form so that small doses could
be absorbed through the mouth.
   Cummins said a veterinarian called him last year seeking
interferon ``to treat a big dog for leukemia.'' Cummins later
learned the man had AIDS and was using the interferon to treat
himself.
   The man agreed to talk to The Associated Press upon condition of
anonymiity. The 47-year-old man said interferon was keeping him
alive.
   ``I contracted AIDS along with three other people who split
infected blood during a transfusion,'' he said Wednesday. ``They
are both dead and I am still here.''
   The man, who said he was diagnosed with AIDS three years ago,
said the drug stimulated his appetite, boosted his low CD4 count
and eradicated fever blisters.
   Dr. Jordan U. Gutterman, an interferon expert at the M.D.
Anderson Center in Houston, said Wednesday that Cummins' use of
interferon to treat animals with leukemia produced ``some
intriguing results.''
   ``We are going to start studies ourselves with interferon for
cancer treatment,'' Gutterman said. ``More studies need to be done
to provide confirmation for the results being reported.''

<HEAD>Sikh Extremists Attack Mourners of Batala Bomb Victim</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sikh extremists shot and killed three
Punjab policemen who were returning from the funeral of a constable
who died in a bombing that claimed at least 29 lives, United News
of India said today.
   Six other policemen and several relatives of the constable were
wounded in Wednesday night's attack near Tetherke in Punjab state's
Batala district, the news agency said.
   At least 29 people, including the constable, were killed Tuesday
when a bomb blamed on militant Sikh separatists exploded in Batala
while Hindus were parading through a crowded vegetable market on a
holiday that celebrates the birthday of a Hindu god.
   The death toll of 29 was given Wednesday by Punjab State Police
Chief K.P.S. Gill, who said earlier police reports of 36 victims
were incorrect. But Indian newspapers and news agencies today gave
death tolls as high as 40.
   Gill said at least three more people were killed by Hindus who
rioted after the bombing.
   Batala, a predominantly Hindu town, has been a frequent target
of Sikh militants who want to establish a separate nation in
Punjab, a prosperous northern farming state where they hold a
slight majority.
   The industrial town of 120,000 people is 25 miles northeast of
Amritsar, the center of the separatist movement and the site of the
Golden Temple, the Sikh faith's holiest shrine.
   Gill said Tuesday's bombing probably was masterminded by Dharam
Singh, a top leader of Babbar Khalsa, the strongest and oldest of
the Sikh radical groups. He said Singh was behind at least 10 other
bombings in the Batala area in recent months.
   Sikh extremists, whose violent campaign for a separate homeland
started in 1982, have killed more than 540 people in Punjab so far
this year, authorities say.
   Nationwide, Sikhs account for 2 percent of the population.
Hindus form 82 percent of India's 880 million people.
   Militants among the Sikhs, whose faith is rooted in both
Hinduism and Islam, say Hindus discriminate against them culturally
and politically.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Embassy has fired 200 of its
remaining 350 Lebanese employees _ effective next month, a
newspaper reported today.
   ``It is my unfortunate duty to inform you that the embassy will
no longer require your service effective May, 5, 1990,'' said a
statement signed by the Beirut embassy's administrative counselor,
Harold T. Burgess.
   The photocopied notice was reproduced by the newspaper Ad-Diyar.
   The statement said the staff was cut ``to reduce the cost of
embassy operations.''
   ``It is the firm intention of the United States government to
return its American staff, when conditions permit, to the level
that existed prior to Sept. 6, 1989,'' the statement said.
   On that day, Ambassador John McCarthy and his remaining American
staff were evacuated from Lebanon after hundreds of angry
Christians demonstrated near the embassy against Washington's
policy in Lebanon.
   The statement said all fired employees will receive their final
salaries and severance pay in accordance with their contract with
the embassy.
   In the event the embassy resumes full operations, ``employees
with records of loyal service and demonstrated skills will be given
strong preference for rehiring,'' it said.

<HEAD>State Changes Policy to Settle Lawsuit With Gay Foster Parents</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state has agreed to change its policy on
foster children placement to settle a lawsuit filed by a homosexual
couple who contended that the policy was discriminatory.
   The new policy proposal makes parenting experience, not marital
status, the key factor in placement decisions, state Human Servics
Secretary Philip Johnston said Wednesday.
   ``This agreement is a victory for children, because it will
serve their best interests,'' Johnston said.
   The lawsuit was filed in Suffolk Superior Court in 1986 by
Donald Babets and David Jean, a homosexual couple from Boston who
had two young brothers taken away by state officials.
   The men claimed the state's policy irrationally and arbitrarily
presumed that a traditional family setting of a husband and wife
was the best placement for every foster child.
   The policy change makes parenting experience the key factor in
placement decisions. It also says sexual orientation, marital
status, race, sex, religion, economic status, education and ethnic
background can all be weighed in a social worker's decision.
   The policy will continue to encourage social workers to look
first to placing a child with relatives. About 23 percent of the
8,455 children placed in foster care are currently placed with
relatives.
   Anthony Doniger, an attorney who represented Babets and Jean
through the Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, said he was
pleased.
   ``The changes that the government has agreed to make in this
policy now returns the system to what it was before this whole
controversy was created,'' he said.
   The policy under dispute called for trying to place foster
children in a traditional setting of a married couple with
parenting experience. Couples without parenting experience or a
single person with experience were given second priority. The third
and final group included individuals without parenting experience.

<HEAD>Eleven Deaths Blamed on Unusual Form of Strep Bacteria</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State health officials say the deaths of 11
Denver-area residents are now being blamed on a rare, virulent form
of strep related to bacteria that cause strep throat.
   The connection between strep and the 11th death was recorded
Wednesday as health officials planned more studies on the unusual
strep, including a determination of who might be at risk of
contracting it.
   Anyone with strep symptoms should see a doctor to prevent the
infection from progressing to a severe form of the disease, state
and federal health investigators said.
   Common strep symptoms are a sore throat, swollen glands and
fever. The severe form of strep is characterized by a sudden onset
of a very high fever, chills, shock and low blood pressure. There
also may be skin or muscle infections and pneumonia, the
investigators said.
   Usually strep bacteria cause sore throats or skin infections.
The severe form, known as group A streptococcus bacteremia, gets
past the body's primary defenses and enters the bloodstream. Strep
can be treated with penicillin.
   Much of the severe strep information collected by the Centers
for Disease Control has come from Denver, said Dr. Ben Schwartz, an
epidemiologist in the CDC's respiratory disease branch in Atlanta.
   In addition to Colorado, investigations also are being conducted
in parts of Alabama, Arizona, California, Maryland and Ohio, where
severe strep clusters have been reported.
   Nationally, cases of severe strep have occurred at a rate of
five per 10,000 population per year. Forty severe strep cases have
been reported since Sept. 1, Schwartz said.

<HEAD>Expelled Hard-Line Leningrad Chief Reinstated to Party</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Politburo member expelled from the
Communist Party in a scandal over the purchase of a Mercedes has
returned the car and received his party card back, Tass reported.
   Yuri Solovyov, former Leningrad party chief and non-voting
member of the party's national Politburo, was demoted last summer
after a humiliating election defeat, then ousted from the party in
February for violating party ethics.
   The 64-year-old Solovyov was reinstated at a meeting of the
Leningrad regional Communist Party following ``numerous requests
from Communists'' and an outpouring of public opinion, Tass said
Wednesday.
   In a February account on his expulsion from the party, the
newspaper Izvestia said Solovyov purchased a ``luxurious Mercedes''
in December for ``a practically symbolic price.''
   The sensational Leningrad television program ``600 Seconds''
broadcast a report showing Solovyov's name on an auto registration
list, and he was expelled at an emergency meeting of the Leningrad
party committee a day later.
   A Tass report at the time implied that Solovyov had abused his
position to obtain the car, a Mercedes 280-S. The model was last
produced in 1985 and cost about $23,000 without taxes in West
Germany.
   Members of the Communist Party elite long have enjoyed special
privileges such as foreign cars and special food allotments, but
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has launched a drive to eliminate
such favors.
   Ordinary Soviets must wait years to purchase domestic cars or
pay a vastly higher black-market price.
   Solovyov was reinstated after participants at last week's party
meeting proposed that he return the car _ now described as a
``second-hand Mercedes'' _ to the shop, and he agreed, Tass
reported.
   Tass quoted Solovyov as saying his expulsion from the party was
a ``horrible injustice and one of the excesses of the system that
has always been a nutrient medium for puppets.''
   At the time of his demotion, Solovyov, one of many conservatives
in the Leningrad party, was criticized for failing to implement
reforms.
   However, in its account of his reinstatement to the party, Tass
quoted him as acknowledging the ``radical changes'' in the Soviet
Union and endorsing the new executive presidency that Gorbachev has
assumed.
   ``I have long believed that a multiparty system can exist in
Soviet society,'' he was quoted as saying. ``Let there be two,
three or even more parties, but it is important that they should
channel their activities into creation, rather than into the
struggle for power.''
   In March 1989 balloting for the national Congress of People's
Deputies parliament, Solovyov failed to win a seat even though he
was the only candidate on the ballot. More than half the voters
crossed off his name.
   He was replaced as regional party leader by Boris Gidaspov,
considered by reformers to be using his base in Leningrad to try to
unite Communist Party conservatives.

<HEAD>Slovak Leader Wants Future Independence for His Republic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Czechoslovak Vice Premier Jan
Carnogursky said in an interview published today that he wants his
republic of Slovakia to become an independent nation eventually.
   ``Europe is headed towards integration. When it becomes a
reality one day, we would like to join it as an independent
subject,'' Carnogursky said in comments to the trade union daily
Prace.
   Asked what he thought of Slovak independence, Carnogursky
avoided a direct answer, suggesting that extremely close economic
ties make it virtually impossible for the two republics to separate
immediately.
   ``Right now, Slovakia does not even have what it takes,'' he
said.
   But asked about Slovakia's role in a possible future European
federation, he made it clear independence is the ultimate objective.
   ``You must admit it would be absurd for one federation to join
another federation,'' he said.
   Carnogursky's comments come during a time of renewed ethnic
tensions between Czechs and Slovaks, triggered by a recent
parliamentary dispute over the country's name.
   Slovaks, who make up one-third of the country's 15.5 million
people, demanded a hyphenated version _ Czecho-Slovakia _ to
strengthen their national identity. Most Czechs consider the demand
an example of petty nationalism.
   To reflect the nation's recent pro-democracy revolution, the
national Parliament on March 30 changed the country's name from the
Socialist Republic of Czechoslovakia to the Czechoslovak Federative
Republic.
   In a compromise between the two republics, Parliament allowed
the people to write the new name of the country either as the
Czechoslovak Federative Republic or the Czecho-Slovak Federative
Republic.
   Nevertheless, 20,000 people demonstrated in the Slovak capital
of Bratislava to demand an independent Slovak state.
   Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel, who is a Czech, and the
premiers of both republics have expressed opposition to the idea of
secession.
   Carnogursky, the leader of the Slovak Christian Democratic
Movement, opposed an open campaign for independence.
   ``We clearly distance ourselves from the demonstration. I speak
here naturally on behalf of the whole Christian Democratic
Movement,'' the newspaper quoted him as saying. ``We are going to
insist on the hyphen, but everything must happen on the basis of
the (Czechoslovak) republic, a reasonable agreement and without
separatist tendencies.''
   Carnogursky's movement on Tuesday formed a coalition with the
Czech People's Party and the Czech Christian Democratic Party,
signaling his desire to work with Czechs who share his group's
politics.
   The ambitious alliance was the first to formally link Czech and
Slovak parties in campaigning for national elections June 8 that
will decide the shape of the government for the next two years.
They will be the first free elections in Czechoslovakia in more
than four decades.

   Singer Peggy Lee won a summary judgment
against Walt Disney Productions in a lawsuit in which she claimed
Disney needed her approval before releasing the videocassette
version of ``Lady and the Tramp.''
   Lee provided voices for four characters and co-wrote songs with
Sonny Burke for the 1955 animated classic.
   Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Huss granted a request
for the judgment establishing Disney's liability in the case, Daily
Variety reported Wednesday.
   Neil Papiano, Lee's attorney, said the court will schedule a
trial to determine damages. Lee is seeking $12.5 million.
   Disney has sold about 3.2 million cassettes of the movie at a
wholesale value of $45 million to $50 million, Daily Variety said.
Theatrical rentals have totaled about $40.25 million.
   Lee argued that her contract with Disney, which gives her the
right to participate in ``transcriptions for sale to the public,''
covered the videocassette release.
   Huss' decision could affect similar contracts drawn before the
emergence of videocassette technology.
   The paper said a Disney spokesman declined to say what steps
Disney might take in the case. The studio cannot appeal until the
damages trial is completed, but it can seek a writ of prohibition
that could prompt an appellate court to review the summary judgment.

   NASA technicians finished testing
the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope today, keeping pace for
Tuesday's launch aboard space shuttle Discovery.
   ``We're working under a tight schedule,'' NASA spokesman Bruce
Buckingham said today. ``But there's really nothing right now to
indicate the 10th can't be met.''
   Further delays in preparations, however, would force a
postponement of the 8:47 a.m. liftoff, NASA said.
   Technicians completed a check of the Hubble's systems and
scientific instruments Wednesday. Overnight, they finished readying
the telescope's computer system for launch.
   On completion of the telescope tests, technicians started
routine pre-launch procedures, placing explosive devices on the
shuttle's solid rocket boosters, external tank and the orbiter
itself to be used in the event of a serious malfunction, Buckingham
said. Cooling propellants also were to be loaded today into the
orbiter's storage tanks.
   Testing was interrupted Monday by a power outage at Kennedy
Space Center that knocked out air conditioning and forced the
shutdown of heat-sensitive computers. Work resumed Tuesday using a
backup power system.
   An unrelated mishap resulted in possible damage Wednesday to one
of shuttle Atlantis' fuel cells. The extent of damage was not
known, but it was not expected to affect Atlantis' next flight, in
July, said NASA spokesman Dick Young.
   Because the tests on the Hubble telescope were longer than
expected, the deadline for completion was moved from midnight
Wednesday to this morning. To give itself extra time, NASA
rearranged launch preparations, said George Diller, another NASA
spokesman.
   Bill Taylor, the telescope's chief engineer, said technicians
were being ``extra cautious.''
   ``We're doing a look-twice and then another look again to make
sure everything's going right,'' Taylor said. The telescope is
NASA's most expensive unmanned spacecraft.
   Discovery's five astronauts are scheduled to put the telescope
into orbit during a five-day mission.
   The Hubble will orbit 380 miles above Earth for 15 years, free
of atmospheric distortion. It will be capable of detecting objects
50 times fainter and with 10 times greater clarity than the best
ground-based observatory.
   Astronomers will be able to study stars and galaxies so distant
that their light has been traveling to Earth for 14 billion years.
   One of Atlantis' fuel cells probably was damaged because
excessive pressure was exerted when the unit was being prepared for
removal for repairs, NASA said. Fuel cells provide electrical power
through a reaction between liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen.
   Atlantis returned to Kennedy Space Center last month after a
secret Pentagon mission to put a spy satellite into orbit. One of
the fuel cell unit's 96 individual cells had failed a voltage test
during a post-flight checkout.

<HEAD>Arab Foreign Ministers Urge Creation of Nuclear-Free Middle East</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq and three other Arab countries called
today for the establishment of a nuclear-free Middle East and urged
the international community to pressure Israel to sign the
Non-Proliferation Treaty.
   On Wednesday, Iraq's foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, said his
country would destroy its supply of chemical weapons if Israel did
the same and signed the 1968 treaty designed to limit the spread of
nuclear weapons.
   Aziz made his remarks in a closed meeting of Arab foreign
ministers in Amman, an official at the talks told The Associated
Press.
   The Arab offer comes three days after President Saddam Hussein
of Iraq said his nation possessed sophisticated binary chemical
weapons and threatened to destroy ``half of Israel'' if his country
were attacked.
   The disclosure followed the arrest in London last week of
several people accused of attempting to smuggle U.S.-made, nuclear
bomb triggers to Iraq. Baghdad has denied that it is trying to
build an atomic bomb.
   In reaction to the arrests, the European Parliament called today
on the 12 member states of the European Community to ban the export
to Iraq of all ``material essential for the production of weapons
of mass destruction and for their delivery.''
   The resolution called for a meeting of the U.N. Security Council
to discuss ``the threats posed by the Iraqi regime to world
security.''
   The resolution stated that the arrests in London ``confirm the
Iraqi regime's intention of equipping itself with nuclear weapons,
despite having signed the International Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty.''
   In today's meeting in Amman, the foreign ministers of Egypt,
Jordan, North Yemen and Iraq issued a communique calling for a
nuclear-free Middle East and the prohibition of chemical weapons.
   ``Our countries, all of them signatories of the
Non-Proliferation Treaty, are keen to keep the Middle East region a
nuclear-free zone,'' the communique said.
   Israel is widely suspected of being the Middle East's sole
nuclear power.
   The four countries called on the ``international community to
pressure Israel to abide by the international will and join the
global nuclear disarmament accord.''
   The 22-year-old pact requires participating nations to agree
that nuclear energy and research will not be used for military
purposes.
   The Arab ministers also said that ``all kinds of destructive
weapons, including nuclear, chemical and biological, should be
prohibited in order to guarantee regional and international
security.''
   But they defended Iraq's production of chemical weapons saying
that ``in light of the continuous chemical and nuclear ... threats
which the Arabs confront, it was necessary to defend ourselves.''
   An Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said there was ``nothing new'' in the statement.
   ``It is a position they have expounded for some time,'' he said.
   In an unusual interview published today in an Israeli newspaper,
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa echoed the Arab ministers'
offer for disarmament.
   ``If there was a sincere desire for peace and security, then
Israel should agree to declare the Middle East an area clear of all
destructive weaponry,'' Sharaa told the mass-circulation Hadashot
newspaper.
   Syria is one of Israel's most implacable foes and Syrian
officials generally avoid all contacts with the Jewish state.

   Five people, including three teen-agers, were
found shot to death inside a suspected crack house and a sixth was
critically wounded, police and witnesses said.
   The shootings occurred about 11 p.m. Wednesday, said police
Deputy Chief James Younger. He said police called to the scene
found the six.
   Four of the victims, ages 15, 16, 20 and 32, were dead at the
scene, said Officer John Leavens, a police spokesman. Another in
his late teens died at Detroit Receiving Hospital, where a sixth
victim was in critical condition this morning, Leavens said. Police
did not know the age of the survivor and the hospital refused to
provide any information beyond his condition.
   Police said a woman, accompanied by two armed men, knocked on
the front door of the house, which Younger called a suspected crack
house. When a man let her in, her companions rushed in and forced
the boys and men to walk to the second floor.
   Ordered to lie down, the six were shot in the head with
automatic and semiautomatic weapons, police said. Four died
instantly; two others were shot while trying to flee and were found
in the basement.
   The attackers then ran back to a car with a second woman at the
wheel and fled, police said.
   There were no immediate arrests, Younger said.
   The incident was the city's worst multiple slaying since 1971,
when three men and four women suspected of drug trafficking were
shot in an apartment, according to The Detroit News.

<TEXT>
   A tough drunken driving bill that provides
for on-the-spot confiscation of licenses in certain cases passed
the Legislature and is awaiting the governor's signature.
   Gov. Richard Celeste needs time to study the bill, but ``he
certainly believes in getting drinking drivers off the road,'' his
press secretary, Heidi Findley, said Wednesday.
   The Senate passed the bill 32-0 on Wednesday, a few minutes
after the House approved it 87-9.
   Drivers who refuse to take a blood-alcohol test or those with
previous drunken driving convictions who register more than .10 on
alcohol tests can have their licenses confiscated by arresting
officers.
   ``I think we truly have the most innovative law in our
country,'' said Rep. Marc Guthrie, the bill's House sponsor. He
said it will help curb traffic deaths. Last year, more than 500
people were killed in traffic accidents in Ohio, and 8,000 were
injured.
   The bill requires a license suspension of at least 90 days for a
first offense and increases in steps that range up to three years
for a fourth offense.
   It provides that judges may not grant driving privileges for
workers for at least 15 days on a first offense, 30 days on a
second and 180 days for a third.
   It leaves the maximum fine for a first offense at $1,000, but
increases the assessment for a second offense from $1,000 to
$1,500. The fines for a third-time offender will be $2,500 and
fourth-time, $10,000.

   Marc Christian, Rock Hudson's ex-lover, has
filed a $22 million libel suit claiming a book portrayed him as a
psychotic criminal.
   Marc Christian, who won $5.5 million from the Hudson estate a
year ago in a landmark AIDS lawsuit, said in the Superior Court
suit filed Wednesday by celebrity lawyer Marvin Mitchelson that he
was shamed by the book's depiction of him.
   The Tom Clark and Dick Kleiner book ``Rock Hudson, Friend of
Mine,'' released last month, referred to Christian as ``a criminal,
a thief, an unclean person, a blackmailer, a psychotic, an
extortionist, a forger, a perjurer, a liar, a whore, an arsonist
and a squatter,'' the suit said.
   In addition to Clark and Kleiner, the suit names New York-based
Pharos Books as defendants. Martha Clarke, a spokeswoman for the
publisher, said today, ``the book speaks for itself'' and that the
company would have no other comment.
   A jury ruled in 1989 that Hudson committed ``outrageous
conduct'' for concealing his AIDS diagnosis from Christian, his
lover for two years.

<HEAD>Aoun and Geagea Accept Another Cease-Fire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fighting died down today after Gen.
Michel Aoun and warlord Samir Geagea accepted a cease-fire called
by clergymen who said the warfare threatened Christians' ``very
existence.''
   Police said overnight howitzer and mortar duels between the
rival Christian forces killed two people and wounded three in east
Beirut and north of the city before the big guns fell silent at
daybreak.
   But sharpshooters of Aoun's army and snipers from Geagea's
Lebanese Forces militia continued to skirmish in the
310-square-mile Christian enclave.
   In Moslem west Beirut, President Elias Hrawi said he would heed
Geagea's appeal that the president's 22,000-man, mainly Moslem army
led by Gen. Emile Lahoud take over army barracks in the enclave.
But it was not believed he had the firepower to dislodge Aoun, nor
were there any signs that Syria's army in Lebanon would back a
foray in the Christian enclave.
   The inconclusive showdown for mastery of the enclave, normally
home for about 1 million Christians, has killed 841 people and
wounded 2,298 since it broke out Jan. 30. Numerous cease-fires have
been declared and broken.
   Police say at least one-fourth of the enclave's population has
fled to safer areas in Lebanon and neighboring countries to escape
the savage fighting that has inflicted damage estimated at $1
billion.
   Aoun's television station, located in Beirut's eastern suburb of
Hazmiyeh, resumed its broadcasts late Wednesday night after
repairing the antenna that was hit early in the evening during
fierce artillery exchanges with Geagea's men. The station was off
the air for five hours.
   Geagea and Aoun, in separate statements, said they accepted a
cease-fire in line with the plea from 20 Maronite Catholic
clergymen who met Wednesday with Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir at his
seat in Bkirki, north of Beirut.
   In their peace bid, the 16th cease-fire call in the 66-day
confrontation, the clergymen told Geagea and Aoun their war
threatened the Christians' ``very existence in Lebanon and the
Orient.''
   The Maronite clerics said continued fighting between Aoun's
19,000 troops and the 6,000 militiamen of Geagea would ``finish off
the Christians.''
   ``The Christians' fate should not be decided by two guns
confronting each other and spreading horror, death and
destruction,'' the clergmen said in their statement, copies of
which were delivered to Geagea and Aoun.
   The statement was released after Geagea called on Lahoud to
``take over all the army barracks in Lebanon.''
   Geagea, in a radio interview, said he was fully prepared to hand
over three army barracks in the Kesrouan and Byblos provinces
dominated by his militia north of Beirut to Lahoud ``within the
framework of a comprehensive plan that puts all army barracks in
Lebanon under the command of Gen. Lahoud.''
   ``I urge Gen. Aoun to hand over his barracks to Gen. Lahoud,''
he added.
   Aoun, Geagea, Hrawi and Lahoud are Maronites, the main Christian
sect that has controlled key government posts, parliament, the army
command and the judiciary since independence from France in 1943.
   Aoun has rejected Hrawi's Nov. 24 election as president by
Lebanese legislators meeting under Arab League auspices. He
complains the peace plan under which Hrawi was elected does not
contain a specific timetable for the withdrawal of Syria's 40,000
troops in Lebanon as part of a peacekeeping mandate. Aoun contends
the Syrians abrogated that mandate by siding with the Moslems.
   Aoun has refused to withdraw from the shell-wrecked presidential
palace in Beirut's eastern suburb of Baabda and also maintained
control of the adjacent defense ministry offices in Yarze. This has
forced Hrawi and Lahoud to set up temporary headquarters in
Syrian-policed Moslem west Beirut.

<TEXT>
   About 25 prisoners held out today for
a fifth day inside the devastated Strangeways Prison, and the
government said it would conduct an inquiry into the causes of one
of Britain's worst prison riots.
   Barry Cuttle, a member of the negotiating team trying to
persuade prisoners to surrender, said between 20 and 25 inmates
remained on the loose inside the 122-year-old prison.
   Ivor Serle, a prison guard and chairman of the local branch of
the Prison Officers' Association, predicted there would be no swift
end to the rebellion.
   ``They're cold and they're desperate, but they're determined to
stay,'' Serle said.
   The Home Office said two more prisoners surrendered today and
more than 25 inmates surrendered Wednesday.
   Terry Bone, deputy director of the north region of the Prison
Service, told reporters Wednesday that the negotiating team would
``persist in our patient negotiations to bring this dreadful event
to a successful conclusion.''
   He said the prisoners still holding out had food and water but
no heat or light.
   Prisoners apparently set a fire overnight as the temperature
dropped below freezing and requested help when the fire got out of
control, the Home Office said.
   ``Firemen were called and were able to direct a hose towards
(the fire) and put it out without making contact with the
prisoners,'' said a Home Office spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   A prison guard who apparently suffered a heart attack while on
duty during the riot died today, the Home Office said. The guard,
Walter Scott, 46, was an administrator and not directly involved in
combating the riot, officials said.
   One prisoner, Derek White, died in North Manchester Hospital on
Tuesday of injuries received at the hands of other inmates when the
riot began Sunday, officials said. White, 46, was awaiting trial on
charges of indecently assaulting three children.
   There were unconfirmed reports of other casualties.
   Across from the prison, crowds of supporters lined police
barricades surrounding the prison, waving and shouting words of
encouragement to the defiant prisoners.
   A Home Office minister, meanwhile, confirmed that prison
authorities had been warned about a possible uprising at the
Victorian, red-brick prison and that they had taken precautions on
Sunday.
   ``Rumors of riots do abound in jails,'' Home Office Minister
Earl Ferrers told the House of Lords. ``It is always difficult to
decide when it is a fact or a rumor. On this occasion, action was
taken as thought appropriate by the governor.''
   Home Secretary David Waddington told the House of Commons that a
senior judge would lead an inquiry, which would begin after the
last prisoner had surrendered.
   The riot began Sunday when prisoners overpowered guards during a
prison chapel service. They seized their keys and used them to gain
access to other parts of the prison.
   In the mayhem in that followed, the rioters smashed fittings,
hurled roofing tiles on guards and started fires throughout the
prison.
   Prison governor Brendan O'Friel told reporters Wednesday that
more than 1,500 inmates were caught up in violence and vandalism.
   Strangeways was built in 1868 to hold 970 men. It held 1,648
prisoners before Sunday's riot.

<HEAD>National Council of Churches Criticized For Prayer For Peace</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Council of Churches has come under
fire for a prayer for Middle Eastern peace that is branded by some
religious leaders as a pro-Palestinian political statement.
   The National Council of Christians and Jews, based in New York,
said the seven-paragraph ``Prayer from Jerusalem'' appears
``extremely provocative.''
   ``It recalls the worst uses of the Christian holy week as a club
against Jews,'' said conference official Elliott Wright.
   The clamor stems from references which critics say appear to
accuse Israel of denying Palestinians their civil and human rights
and to blame the Jewish state for the violence of the Palestinian
uprising.
   ``We see there is no peace and that people remain in agony and
suffering,'' the prayer reads in part. ``Free them from oppression,
restore to them the right of life and to independence in their own
land, just as other nations enjoy this right.''
   The NCC, an umbrella group of 31 Protestant and Orthodox
churches, had distributed the prayer to its members for reading in
churches this Sunday, which is Palm Sunday.
   The prayer was prepared by the Middle East Council of Churches,
a coalition of 24 Orthodox, Catholic, and Protestant churches in
the Middle East.
   Rabbi James Rudin, director of the American Jewish Committee's
office of interreligious affairs, labeled parts of the prayer
``malicious slander.''

   Israeli soldiers shot and killed a 16-year-old
Palestinian today when they fired on youths protesting in the West
Bank city of Ramallah, hospital officials said.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, a Palestinian plowed his truck
into an Israeli army foot patrol, injuring at least one soldier,
the army said. Youths began stoning the soldiers after the
incident, and troops opened fire, wounding at least four
Palestinians, Arab witnesses said.
   Eleven other Palestinians were reported shot and wounded in
other, scattered clashes with troops in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip. The wounded included a 2-year-old boy hit in the head
with a rubber bullet, Arab doctors said.
   Mustafa Ali Jaro died of a wound to the head from one of the
rubber-coated steel balls used by the army for riot control. He was
shot during clashes in the main square of Ramallah, six miles north
of Jerusalem, Arab reporters said.
   The army confirmed the shooting and said Jaro, from the nearby
Jalazoun refugee camp, was evacuated to a local hospital.
   In Nablus, the truck with a blue West Bank license plate
careened into the army patrol near the Askar Palestinian refugee
camp on the city's northern edge.
   ``It seems it was on purpose, that it was an attack,'' said an
army officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The condition of
the injured soldier was not immediately known.
   Palestinian witnesses said the driver of the truck escaped but
soldiers captured a passenger.
   Immediately afterward, soldiers opened fire with rubber and
plastic bullets on stone-throwing youths, the witnesses said.
Doctors at Al-Ittihad Hopital said four people were hurt, including
two 14 year olds struck with rubber bullets.
   The army sealed off the area and clamped a curfew on the Askar
camp, ordering its 8,000 residents to stay in their homes, Arab
reporters said.
   The death in Ramallah brought to 671 the number of Palestinians
killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians during the 27-month-old
uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.
   At least 202 other Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs
during the revolt, most as suspected collaborators with Israeli
authorities. Forty-three Israelis also have been slain in the
violence.
   In the Gaza Strip, meanwhile, Palestinian activists forced the
closure of the municipal government building in Khan Yunis to
protest the army's sealing the main mosque in the southern town,
Palestinian reporters said.
   Soldiers welded shut the mosque door Wednesday night, but it was
broken open by town residents today, the reporters said. They said
soldiers then resealed the door.
   A military spokeswoman said the army was checking the report of
trouble at Khan Yunis' Great Mosque.
   Three other mosques have been ordered closed in the Gaza Strip
because the army claims they are centers of revolt against the
occupation.
   A dispute between two Palestinian factions erupted into violence
in the West Bank village of Awarta near Nablus.
   Residents said six houses belonging to activists in PLO Chief
Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction were set ablaze in the village by
masked youths from the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine on Tuesday night.
   However, Popular Front activists said the group set the fires at
the homes of suspected collaborators with Israel and then forced
the owners from the village.
   The Popular Front has been urging Fatah to use harsher tactics
against the Israelis in the uprising. The latest dispute was over
each group painting over slogans sprayed on walls by the rival
faction.

   A West Virginia city shut down its water intakes on the Ohio
River and two Ohio cities intensified treatment of water from the
river as a fuel spill flowed slowly downstream today.
   At least 75,000 gallons of diesel oil, gasoline and kerosene
spilled into an Allegheny River tributary upriver from Pittsburgh
on Friday, forcing Pennsylvania cities along the river to shut
water intakes. The Allegheny and Monongahela rivers meet in
Pittsburgh to form the Ohio River.
   At East Liverpool, Ohio, water superintendent Glenn Woodward
said the worst of the spill appeared to have passed by his city
Wednesday. He said fuel concentrations peaked around 3 p.m. at 14
or 15 parts per billion. That was down to a normal level of 4 ppb
early today.
   The city treats about 3 million gallons of river water a day,
Woodward said.
   In Steubenville, Ohio, 25 miles downstream from East Liverpool,
Assistant Public Works Director Bill Fabian said the spill had
apparently arrived, but lab tests of the water were not completed
this morning.
   Two water intakes near the river's surface were closed at East
Liverpool. Those deeper in the river remained open to draw water
for the city of 7,000 people.
   ``It's here, but you can't tell it by sight or smell. We started
accelerated treatment of water at 3 yesterday afternoon and will
continue until Sunday to make sure we get the leading and tail
edges of it,'' Fabian said.
   Across the river in Weirton, W.Va., workers shut down the water
intake pump Wednesday, said Ken Capozzoli, a maintenance operator
at the city water treatment plant.
   ``We don't really know how long the wells can supply us, but
we'll do fine for the couple of days it should take for the spill
to pass,'' Capozzoli said.
   Downtstream in Wheeling, W.Va., city workers prepared to mix
activated carbon with river water to absorb any remaining fuel.
   ``They had pretty good luck using the carbon to remove the oil
up in Pittsburgh,'' said Phil Kowalski, supervisor of Wheeling's
water plant. ``We don't anticipate that people will notice any
difference. We may have to slow down our treatment process, but the
reservoirs will pick up the slack and there shouldn't be any drop
in pressure.''
   The water supplies of some communities on the river will not be
affected by the spill. Wellsville, Ohio, about six miles south of
East Liverpool, draws its water from a reservoir fed by springs,
said Mayor Nunzio Lombardozzi.
   In Beaver County, Pa., the Midland Water Authority's treatment
plant reopened its intake valves Wednesday, said Dan Zuppe, the
chief filter plant operator. The system was operating at about half
its normal pumping volume, he said.

   Soldiers in South Africa's
smallest nominally independent homeland today overthrew the
homeland's government, according to a radio report.
   There were no immediate reports of fighting or casualties in
Venda.
   Singing and dancing in the streets greeted news of the coup
against President Frank Ravele, the South African Press Association
reported.
   The deputy chief of the Venda Defense Force, Gabriel Ramushwana,
announced the coup over Radio Thohoyandou and told everyone to go
home and return to work on Monday.
   He did not mention the fate of Ravele. The government has been
beset by mass protests in the past few weeks and several
demonstrations were dispersed by police firing guns. Some deaths
were reported then, but details were sketchy.
   The protesters demanded an investigation into allegations that
some Cabinet members participated in ritual murder and withcraft,
and demonstrators have also demanded that the 2,500-square-mile
republic be reincorporated into South Africa.
   Venda is the third of South Africa's four nominally independent
homelands to suffer a military coup in the past two and a half
years. The fourth, Bophuthatswana, survived an attempted coup in
February, 1988, after the president, Lucas Mangope, was rescued by
South African police.
   South Africa also has six tribal homelands that have refused to
accept independence, which is not recognized by other countries and
deprives the homelands' residents of South African citizenship,
residential, pension and work rights.
   Venda is located in the far northeast corner of South Africa,
adjoining the Kruger National Park, with a small strip of South
African territory separating it from the Zimbabwe border.

   The timber industry predicts economic
catastrophe if the government follows recommendations to save the
northern spotted owl from extinction by reducing logging in the
Northwest's old forests.
   ``What we've been presented today is a program that forces a
very stark choice between owls and people,'' said Mark Rey,
executive director of the American Forest Resource Council in
Washington, D.C. ``It obviously provides a maximum advantage for
the owls with significant impacts on the people.''
   A panel of government scientists said logging must stop in a
large section of federal forests if the northern spotted owl is to
be saved. The stands of old trees in the Northwest are the primary
habitat for the owl.
   The committee on Wednesday recommended a reduction of about 25
percent in the allowable cut of timber in national forests and a 30
percent to 40 percent reduction on Bureau of Land Management lands.
   John Hampton, president of Willamina Lumber Co. and chairman of
the Northwest Forest Resource Council, said initial estimates
indicate up to 60,000 jobs in the Northwest would be lost as a
direct or indirect result.
   ``Some 4 to 5 million acres will be set aside under the
recommendation for owl habitat at an estimated cost of $95 million
(in timber) for each pair of spotted owls,'' he said at a news
conference.
   The American Forest Resource Council estimated 9,000 jobs would
be lost in the region.
   Hampton said his group's best hope is to get the Bush
administration and Congress to consider the impact implementing the
recommendation would have on the industry.
   The Oregon Lands Coalition, a pro-industry group, condemned the
environmentalists who have fought logging.
   ``The preservationists have done their deadly work,'' coalition
Chairwoman Valerie Johnson said.
   Environmentalists were elated by the report.
   ``This confirms what environmentalists have been saying for a
number of years,'' said Larry Tuttle of The Wilderness Society,
``that the spotted owl is in grave danger and by extension
therefore the ancient forest is also in grave danger.''
   The panel's recommendations are expected to weigh heavily in the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's decision on whether to list the
owl as a threatened or endangered species. Such a designation would
mean further restrictions on logging in old-growth forests that
provide the bulk of timber harvested in the region.
   A decision on designating the owl a threatened species is
expected by June 23.
   In Forks, Wash., Jerry Leppell, president of the American Logger
Solidarity Committee, said one government study estimated that a 30
percent cutback in logging would lead to 1,000 lost jobs and 800
families leaving the town.
   ``We all like spotted owls,'' he said. ``There's no problem with
spotted owls. The gripe we've got is with preservationists. I think
they're overeducated and they drive through and judge us within
three hours instead of living here all their life.''

   Michael Jackson took top billing over the
Bush-Gorbachev summit for a brief time this morning.
   President Bush welcomed the rock star to the White House, posing
for photos with the flamboyantly dressed Jackson in the Rose Garden.
   The picture taking occurred shortly after the White House
released word of the May 30-June 3 summit meeting between Bush and
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   No one seemed really sure why Jackson had been invited.
   ``I just wanted to welcome Michael Jackson here. And, named
artist of the decade, and he has a tremendous following,'' Bush
said before making his first public remarks about the summit.
   ``He does good work in what we call the `points of light'
concept. I just wanted to bring him out here and officially welcome
him to the White House once again.
   ``Glad you're here, sir,'' Bush said, turning to the recording
artist, who laughed and grinned as Bush made a few comments to
reporters about the upcoming Soviet summit.
   Jackson, his black hair cascading in curls to his shoulders, was
resplendent in black and red _ snug black slacks with red stripes
down the sides, a black braided short jacket emblazoned with a red
arm band, and black gloves.
   He wore sunglasses, black boots with ornate silver trim, and a
silvery bauble pinned to his chest like a medal.
   He chatted with Bush as they walked from the Oval Office to meet
photographers, but did not speak to the assembled media.
   Mrs. Bush and the Bushes' daughter-in-law, Margaret Bush, then
walked Jackson down the driveway to the residence quarters of the
White House.
   White House press aide Jay Allison said Jackson is interested
``in the whole program'' that Bush calls the ``Points of Light''
idea for getting people involved in community service. Allison did
not know specifically why Bush invited him to the White House.
   Jackson is to receive an Entertainer of the Decade award from
the private
   Capital Children's Museum in Washington. He will be the guest of
honor tonight at a fund-raising reception to benefit the museum.

   The first non-Communist Parliament in East
German history convened today and began replacing four decades of
Stalinist rule with a democratic government.
   In the hall where Communist lawmakers once meted out edicts,
lawmakers chosen in the nation's first free elections on March 18
began the process of forming a government that could be the
country's last before unification with West Germany.
   ``Forty years of difficult times have ended in this moment,''
said Lothar Piche, 63, the eldest member of the new Parliament, as
he called the session to order in the Palace of the Republic. ``God
support our German fatherland.''
   The 400-member Parliament was expected to empower Christian
Democrat leader Lothar de Maiziere to build a new government and to
decide whether to form a commission to investigate allegations that
some new Parliament members worked with the dreaded secret police.
   In its first action, the 390 new leaders who attended the
session elected physician Sabine Bergmann-Pohl, a Christian
Democrat, as president of the Parliament.
   Among those seeking the post were outgoing Communist Premier
Hans Modrow, who leads a rebuilt pro-democracy party that finished
a distant third in the March elections. He finished third in the
voting for Parliament president, behind Social Democrat Reinhard
Hoeppner.
   The Parliament also created an office of president to be a
ceremonial head of state, as East Germany's new government was
being shaped to mirror that of West Germany's.
   Dr. Bergmann-Pohl is to serve as head of state until a president
is elected by Parliament. De Maiziere will likely be the premier,
or prime minister.
   Dr. Bergmann-Pohl called on lawmakers to work with their
counterparts in West Germany to merge their nations and to bring
the capital of a single Germany back to a united Berlin.
   The Parliament also formally abolished the old Communist
Presidium, the Council of State.
   De Maiziere will lead talks in the coming days on forming a new
Cabinet.
   If de Maiziere is successful in bringing together the disparate
political groups, Parliament will then reconvene on April 11 and
vote on his Cabinet nominations, said Martin Kirchner, a
high-ranking Christian Democrat.
   De Maiziere leads a Christian Democrat-led conservative alliance
that has been trying to form a coalition with the left-leaning
Social Democrats and a smaller group of liberal lawmakers.
   His Alliance for Germany won the most seats in the March 18
elections. But it needs a broad coalition to ensure the two-thirds
vote needed in Parliament to enact constitutional changes required
for unification.
   Kirchner predicted that a government may be formed quickly ``so
that this nation is no longer devoid of government.''
   Backroom political wrangling and charges that newly elected
lawmakers had ties to the secret police of the ousted Communist
regime have taken the steam out of the reunification process.
   A Communist-led caretaker government that followed the ousted
regime of hard-liner Erich Honecker in October has been running the
country.
   The Alliance for Germany favors rapid reunification while the
left-leaning Social Democrats favor a more gradual pace, with each
East German state to decide independently on a merger.
   Nevertheless, swift reunification is demanded by voters, who
backed de Maiziere's coalition overwhelmingly after he promised a
quick merger as a means to Western prosperity.
   Even acting Social Democrat party leader Markus Meckel said
Wednesday he favors reunification ``as quickly as possible.''
   The negotiations quickened this week after West Germany's
central bank said it was recommending a 2-1 conversion of East
German marks to West German marks as part of a currency union.
   East German parties united in opposition to that proposal,
calling for a direct 1-1 conversion to ease the withdrawal pains of
unemployment and high prices as East Germany sheds its socialist
system.
   West Germany said Wednesday it wants a pact on monetary union by
early next month, but the East Germans are expected to be tough
negotiators once serious talks begin.
   De Maiziere's opposition to the West German Bundesbank proposal
raised his stature with the smaller parties, which have often
described him as a puppet of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   But the Social Democrats still are opposed to the more
conservative elements in de Maiziere's alliance. Much of the
wrangling has been over the distribution of Cabinet posts in a new
government.
   The Social Democrats, who favor more emphasis on environmental
and social issues, have asked for the education, foreign and labor
ministries.

<HEAD>Cheney Urges Congress to Give Pentagon More Leeway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New material, editing throughout with Cheney announcement on
budget management, other additional details.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney urged Congress
today to give the Pentagon more leeway to manage its budget,
contending that less intense congressional oversight would save
money and improve defense programs.
   ``We can do much to improve defense management by ourselves. We
could accomplish far more with the cooperation of Capitol Hill,''
Cheney said in a statement.
   The defense secretary's recommendations were contained in a
41-page policy paper sent to Congress today. It recommended many
changes in the way the Defense Department manages its programs and
personnel, as well as changes in the congressional budget-writing
process.
   Among Cheney's recommendations was one that Congress appropriate
defense spending for two-year periods instead of every year. That
would help stabilize Pentagon programs by forcing more clear-cut
choices on spending priorities, the report said.
   ``If next year's budget debate is only a few days away from the
end of this year's debate, there is no reason to accept a negative
decision as final,'' the report said.
   On Wednesday, Cheney announced the Pentagon was reassessing the
need for the Navy's Seawolf nuclear attack submarine and the
Arleigh Burke-class destroyer in light of disarmament moves and
political changes under way in the Soviet Union.
   In a speech to the American Society of Newspaper Editors, he
said the move meant the Pentagon was determined to readjust
American defenses in response to global changes.
   ``As circumstances change, we will adjust the kinds of naval
forces we need,'' Cheney said. ``We are now looking at a smaller
Navy than we were in the early 1980s.''
   The United States should not, however, give up its global
maritime superiority, he said.
   ``We'll need to control the seas regardless of what happens in
Moscow,'' Cheney said, in part because the American economy is
being more interwoven with the world economy and thus is
increasingly dependent on the free flow of goods on the seas.
   The defense secretary earlier ordered reviews of other major new
weapons systems, including the Air Force's B-2 bomber, the Army's
new light helicopter and the Strategic Defense Initiative research
on an antimissile defense. He said results from those reviews will
be completed within the next few weeks.
   Meanwhile, two Republican members of the Senate Armed Services
Committee today called on President Bush to limit production of the
B-2 and delay the Advanced Tactical Fighter as part of additional
cuts in defense spending.
   ``We believe that the United States can meet its defense
requirements with budget levels lower than those proposed by the
administration,'' said Sens. William Cohen of Maine and John McCain
of Arizona.
   The administration has proposed about a 2 percent reduction in
defense spending in each of the next five years, but twice that
amount is realistic, the GOP senators said. By their calculations,
the current $300 billion defense budget would be reduced by about
$50 billion.
   Cheney gave no details of the Navy program reviews. A department
spokesman, Bob Hall, said today the internal review would
reconsider whether the Seawolf subs and the Burke destroyers meet
the Navy's requirements, taking into account such factors as
maritime strategy, cost, schedules and performance.
   The administration is proposing to cancel many smaller weapons
systems and plans to cut about 50,000 men and women from the
2.1-million-member armed forces in 1991. The Army and Air Force
have taken the brunt of the reductions, but Cheney's remarks to the
newspaper editors indicated the Navy's share of the pain may grow.
   A scaling back of the Navy's attack submarine fleet already was
in the wind. Last month, Vice Adm. Daniel Cooper told a House panel
that budget constraints would limit deployments to fewer than 80 by
the year 2000. The goal has been 100 by that date.
   The first Seawolf nuclear attack submarine is scheduled for
completion in mid-1995. It is designed to be quieter and have more
weapons, greater speed and more capability to kill Soviet subs than
the existing Los Angeles-class attack sub.
   The Navy is planning to buy 12 Seawolfs at an average projected
cost of $1.57 billion apiece.
   The Seawolf has been criticized for being too expensive, but
Adm. Carlisle Trost, chief of naval operations, wrote recently that
the sub ``is required in order to ensure that we maintain an
acceptable level of risk in the face of the continuing
modernization of the Soviet submarine force.''
   The Burke guided-missile destroyers are to replace the Adams and
Farragut class destroyers that were built in the 1960s. The
Pentagon claims the Burke ships will be the most advanced and
powerful destroyers ever built. They are to be equipped with the
high-tech Aegis aircraft tracking system and sophisticated missiles.
   The Navy plans to buy 33 of the destroyers at an average
projected cost of $820 million apiece.
   The Navy is scheduled to take possession of the first destroyer
in February 1991. Eight of the new ships are under construction and
the Navy in February awarded contracts valued at a combined $1.1
billion to build two more.

<HEAD>French Inventors Win Prize For Drawing Pen for the Blind</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto GEV1</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A drawing pen for the blind and partially blind
won the grand prize today at the annual Geneva Invention Fair.
   The two Frenchmen who developed the pen originally intended it
to be used as a tool for teaching blind youngsters computer science.
   But Jack Sagot, a special education teacher in Paris, and Gerard
Pavard, a teacher of handicapped children near the city of Nantes,
eventually developed it for general use by the blind in drawing,
graphics and the production of documents in the Braille alphabet.
   The pen has a special ink that forms a slight relief, or ridge,
after drying for a few minutes. The raised patterns can easily be
detected by people who touch them, the inventors say.
   The drawing paper can be heated to heighten the relief for
children just starting to read Braille, Pavard said.
   Fair organizers claimed the invention is the biggest
breakthrough in the field since the 1829 invention of Braille,
which uses patterns of embossed dots to signify letters.
   An international jury at the weeklong fair chose the pen as top
entry among some 1,000 inventions from 25 countries.
   It was not immediately clear if the inventors would receive a
cash prize.

   Author E.L. Doctorow is winner of the
PEN@Faulkner Award for best American fiction published in 1989 for
his eighth novel, ``Billy Bathgate,'' the Folger Shakespeare
Library announced Thursday.
   Doctorow, 59, a professor at New York University, will receive a
$7,500 cash prize at an awards ceremony May 12 at the library,
which administers the awards. Four finalists will receive $2,500
each.
   Doctorow's award-winning novel is about a young man from the
Bronx who becomes the protege of the infamous 1930s gangster, Dutch
Schultz. Doctorow previously had won the National Book Critics
Circle Award for ``Billy Bathgate'' and ``Ragtime'' and the
National Book Award for ``World's Fair.''
   The PEN@Faulkner Award was founded by American writers 10 years
ago to pay tribute to novelist William Faulkner, who used his Nobel
Prize money to encourage other writers. The award is associated
with the American branch of PEN, the international writers'
organization whose name is an anacronym for poets, playwrights,
editors, essayists and novelists.
   The four other nominees who also will be honored at the May 12
ceremony are Russell Banks, Molly Gloss, Josephine Jacobsen and
Lynne Sharon Schwartz.

<HEAD>Coalition Set to Fight Excise Tax Hike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The highway, tobacco and alcohol industries
opened a campaign Thursday against using higher federal excise
taxes to reduce the budget deficit.
   Raising taxes on gasoline, cigarettes, beer, wine and liquor
would impose an unfair burden on lower-income Americans, the
Coalition Against Regressive Taxation told a news conference.
   A study prepared for the coalition by the Peat Marwick Policy
Economics Group concluded that lower-income families already pay
five times as high a share of their income on excise taxes as
higher-income Americans do.
   ``If there is to be a tax'' for deficit reduction, said Thomas
J. Donohue, president of the coalition and of the American Trucking
Associations, ``then all the companies and all the citizens should
share in that tax.''
   Although President Bush says he opposes any tax increase for
deficit reduction, several members of Congress are urging higher
excise taxes for that purpose.
   For example, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the
House Ways and Means Committee, has outlined a comprehensive plan
that includes higher taxes for gasoline, beer, wine and cigarettes,
as well as increased income taxes and a one-year freeze on Social
Security benefits.
   The Peat Marwick report said that while a $20-billion-a-year
boost in excise taxes would raise the tax burden of the average
American by 1.9 percent, the one-third of people with the lowest
incomes would see a 6.5 percent increase.

<HEAD>Humanities Chief Echoes Call Against Grants Censorship</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the federal program that
distributes federal aid to libraries and for scholarly work told a
Senate panel Thursday that the controversy over arts financing has
hindered her agency's work.
   ``The system we had in place before was much more
satisfactory,'' Lynne V. Cheney told the Labor and Human Resources
subcommittee on education, arts and humanities.
   Cheney, chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities,
said changes that Congress ordered last year in the grants process
have given the endowment veto power over grants known as subgrants.
   Under the subgrant process, a foundation or other organization
receives a grant from the endowment and parcels out the money for
various projects. The group receiving the overall grant judges who
should receive money from it and the endowment then passes on the
subgrant.
   When Congress last fall appropriated funds for the humanities
endowment and its companion National Endowment for the Arts, it
said the subgrants should be more tightly controlled.
   The condition was a result of the political furor over two
controversial exhibits funded by the NEA. The restrictions do not
cover subgrants awarded by state humanities councils.
   Both the House and Senate are holding hearings this year on
renewing the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities,
the parent agency for the arts and humanities endowments.
   Cheney told the Senate panel that there never has been a
controversial grant award by the humanities endowment. Supporters
of the arts endowment say only 20 of the 85,000 grants it has
awarded have been controversial.
   ``I'm not seeking restrictive language,'' she said in a
reflection of the Bush administration's opposition to content
restriction in arts grants. ``There simply is no rationale'' for
such language, she said.

   Tens of thousands of people staged a solidarity
march and rally in this British colony today in memory of the
hundreds of pro-democracy students killed last year in China.
   The demonstration, called the ``Chinese Grand Parade'' coincided
with Chingming, the day Chinese mourn their dead.
   The protesters gathered at a downtown park where many
demonstrators held bouquets of chrysanthemums, the traditional
flower for ancestor worship.
   Chanting slogans including ``Democracy Will Win'' and singing
patriotic songs, the crowd of almost 20,000 marched several miles
to Victoria park.
   The marchers then laid wreaths at a makeshift monument in the
park and signed their names in a book of condolences.
   The signatures will be burned at a candle-light vigil on June 4,
the first anniversary of the Beijing massacre, organizers of the
demonstration said.
   In an address at the park, Sezto Wah, chairman of the Hong Kong
Alliance in Support of the Patriotic Democratic Movement in China,
which organized today's rally, said: ``We feel obliged to pay
tribute to those who sacrifice their lives in the name of
democracy, particularly those killed in Tiananmen Square by tanks
and troops last year.''
   At least 500 students were killed when Chinese troops, supported
by tanks, crushed the pro-democracy movement based in Beijing's
Tiananmen square.
   The Alliance also published a full-page advertisement in a local
newspaper today listing the names of 542 people it said were in
jail or under house arrest in China since June.
   ``Raindrops keep falling on the day of remembrance of ancestors,
in this world everybody remembers you all,'' the advertisement said.
   China has labeled the Alliance as ``counter-revolutionary'' for
its alleged role in helping dissidents escape from China.
   The crackdown in Beijing provoked widespread world-wide
condemnation.
   Leaders in Hong Kong were especially concerned as many Chinese
living in Hong Kong have relatives in China and the British colony
is scheduled to revert to Chinese rule in 1997.

others in northern India, news reports said.
   The bus overturned and tumbled into a ditch along the road near
Banur, 150 miles northwest of New Delhi in Punjab state, Press
Trust of India and United News of India news agencies said.
   Press Trust said the accident occurred at 4.30 a.m. when most of
the passengers were asleep. The deaths were caused by drowning, as
the ditch was filled with water, it said.
   United News said the driver and the conductor of the bus, who
were reported to be drunk, fled.
   The bus was carrying 82 people from Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh
state, Press Trust said. It did not say where the pilgrims were
going.
   Punjab and Uttar Pradesh are separated by Haryana state.

   Swedish police today concluded their
two-day interrogation of a Palestinian suspected of involvement in
the 1988 bombing of a Pam Am flight that killed 270 people.
   Defense lawyer Sven-Erik Sjogren said Mohammed Abu Talb, who is
serving a life sentence in Sweden on unrelated terrorism charges,
was questioned by Swedish police after he refused to answer
questions from Scottish officials.
   ``We are waiting for the Scottish to review my client's
replies,'' Sjogren told the national TT news agency. ``It's
possible they may return for more questioning later this spring.''
   Neither Sjogren nor the news report disclosed what was said
during the questioning of the suspect.
   The Boeing 747 blew up over the Scottish village of Lockerbie,
killing 259 passengers and crew and 11 people on the ground.
   Abu Talb was suspected of involvement in the bombing when he was
discovered to have visited Malta two months before the Pan Am bomb.
Traces of clothing from a Maltese store were found in the suitcase
believed to have contained the bomb.
   Abu Talb, who moved to Sweden in 1983, has denied any link to
the Lockerbie case.
   He was sentenced to life imprisonment by a Swedish district
court in December for planting explosives in Denmark and the
Netherlands in 1985 and 1986.

   A leader of the pro-democracy movement
that was crushed in China last June believes the campaign might
have succeeded if it had come after the uprisings in Eastern
Europe, a newspaper reported Thursday.
   The activist, Chai Ling, 23, escaped to France this week with
her husband, Feng Congde, after 10 months on the run in Beijing.
Both were on a list of 21 student leaders sought by Chinese
Communist authorities, who said the pro-democracy movement was a
``counterrevolutionary rebellion.''
   The couple has remained in hiding.
   ``We might have had a good chance to succeed if our movement had
come after the recent pro-democracy trend in Eastern Europe,'' the
mass-circulation China Times quoted Chai as saying in an exclusive
interview.
   Chai said that while hiding in China, she heard about Eastern
European developments in radio broadcasts from the Voice of America
and the British Broadcasting Corp.
   ``The colossal changes in Eastern Europe surprised and
encouraged us. Anyway, we had made the first step, and it was a
correct step,'' she added.
   The Chinese demonstrations began in April. A wave of Eastern
European revolutions started in October in East Germany and soon
spread to other Soviet bloc states, ending decades of Communist
domination.
   China's movement was crushed June 4 when troops shot their way
into central Beijing, driving student protesters from Tiananmen
Square and killing hundreds of unarmed demonstrators.
   The China Times said Chai expressed opposition to the economic
sanctions imposed on China by the United States and other nations
after the military crackdown.
   ``We don't agree with the economic sanctions because our people
already lead a hard life,'' she said.
   According to the newspaper, Chai and her husband fled Beijing by
train to the eastern city of Wuhan after the pro-democracy movement
was crushed. They later separated and remained apart for eight
months before reuniting two months ago.
   Chai has refused to disclose her escape route for fear of
endangering people who helped her and her husband flee, the China
Times said.
   The newspaper quoted her as saying she and her husband would
like to study in the United States.

<TEXT>
   The guerrilla faction led by Palestinian
terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal said Thursday it was making contacts
aimed at winning freedom for at least one of eight Europeans it
holds hostage.
   Walid Khaled, Beirut spokesman for Fatah-Revolutionary Council,
said the group was acting at the request of Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi.
   In a typewritten statement, Khaled said the group was making
``immediate contacts with the concerned parties.'' He did not
specify which parties had been contacted.
   Abu Nidal's group has acknowledged holding a French woman,
Jacqueline Valente, 32; her two daughters born in captivity, named
Liberte and Palestine; and five Belgians.
   Khaled said Gadhafi called for the release of Ms. Valente ``and
her family.'' But he did not say which hostage or hostages would be
released.
   On Wednesday, Gadhafi said Ms. Valente should be freed as a
compassionate measure marking the Moslem holy month of Ramadan.
Ramadan ends in the last week of April.
   Abu Nidal is backed by Libya and believed to be living in
Tripoli, the Libyan capital.
   Fatah-Revolutionary Council said Nov. 8, 1987, that it had
seized the hostages aboard the French yacht Silco, off the
Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip.
   It claimed they were collaborating with Israel's Mossad secret
service. This was denied by their friends, who said they were Roman
Catholics on a holiday cruise.
   French and Belgian governments, as well as the International
Committee of the Red Cross, have been seeking their release.
   Two other daughters of Ms. Valente were freed after Libyan
intervention on Dec. 29, 1988.
   In addition to the boat hostages, 18 Westerners, including eight
Americans, are missing in Lebanon. Most of them are believed held
by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem factions.
   American journalist Terry Anderson is the longest-held hostage.
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,
was kidnapped March 16, 1985. Most of the other hostages have been
held at least three years.

   States in the industrial Midwest, seemingly on
their last legs as the 1980s began, are now flexing their economic
muscles, while Plains and Rocky Mountain states show little sign of
recovering from the last recession, a private research group
reported Thursday.
   The study by the Corporation for Enterprise Development, a
research and consulting organization, also said states on both
coasts generally are in good economic health, and those in the
South are improving but still have a long way to go.
   Those states whose economies are healthy or improving have
invented their own development policies in a ``quiet revolution,''
rather than wait for federal solutions to evolve, according to the
study.
   ``The story is that while Washington continues to be stalemated
over what we ought to do over foreign competition, the states have
gone ahead and invented their own strategies,'' corporation
president Doug Ross said.
   The findings are including in the fourth annual ``Development
Report Card for the States,'' financed by corporations, labor
unions and private foundations. In it, the states are graded
according to economic performance, business vitality, economic
capacity and government policy.
   The study said that for more than 40 years, states relied on
``smokestack chasing,'' or luring out-of-state businesses with
incentives and subsidies, to build their economies.
   By the late 1970s that approach no longer worked as ``dramatic
changes in communication, transportation and technology'' often
made it impossible for U.S. businesses to meet overseas
competition, the study said.
   States thus began creating ``home-grown'' strategies that
focused mostly on new and existing businesses and ``now encourage
and support indigenous development _ modernizing in-state
businesses, easing their expansion and product development,
educating their workers and facilitating start-ups,'' Ross
explained.
   Here is how the corporation views the various regional economies:
   _INDUSTRIAL MIDWEST: Recovering from long decline. Condition:
Still improving satisfactorily.
   Less than 10 years after the early 1980s recession nearly did
them in, the ``Rust Belt'' states are resurgent. It may never again
be the world's industrial center, but it is showing signs of its
old muscle. Pennsylvania, with two As and two Bs this year, leads
the region. Other Great Lakes states earn mostly good or average
grades. Overall, the region's economic performance is getting
stronger and it shines in state policy, with all As and Bs.
   ``Recent investments in technology, infrastructure and skill
improvements as well as policy innovations in development finance
and industry modernization have paid off in new economic strength
for these states,'' Ross said.
   NORTHEAST AND WEST COAST: Continuing in good economic health.
Condition: Stable, with some troubling symptoms.
   The Northeast and Pacific states continue to be the nation's
strongest economically. Of the 13 states with no more than one
grade below B this year, nine are in these two regions _
California, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New
York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont.
   But Ross cautions that ``despite their recent prosperity, these
states show some troubling signs. The Northeast is struggling with
labor shortages, the Pacific wrestling with the decline of the
timber industry. We already see economic slowdowns here _ and
significant defense cutbacks on the horizon could further shock
their systems.''
   SOUTH: Surprisingly healthy, getting healthier. Condition:
Guarded.
   Of the 13 states with no As or Bs on any index this year, only
five are in the South. Real progress is obvious in state policy _
although limited resources slow the speed of change. Though most
southern states earn Cs in policy, several still earn Ds but
Virginia rates a B.
   ``Progress has been heartening in the South, but the road to
recovery is still long and uphill,'' Ross said.
   PLAINS AND ROCKY MOUNTAIN STATES: Weak, static. Condition:
Critical.
   States in the Great Plains and Intermountain West, with the
exception of Utah, are still lingering from the early 1980s
recession. Of the 13 states that received no Report Card grade
above a C, eight are in these two regions _ Arizona, Idaho,
Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota and
Wyoming.
   Few are working aggressively to revive their economies; indeed,
four of the five Fs in state policy are in these two regions, along
with many Ds _ with the notable exceptions of Iowa and Oklahoma,
which merit As.
   ``These states are essentially the couch potatoes of economic
innovation,'' Ross said. ``It seems they are simply waiting for the
next economic boom to blot out the current bust. It is a wait that
will be in vain, given the enormous structural changes affecting
our economy.''

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A soldier who held an empty
commercial jet for three days, threatening to blow it up unless he
was flown to the United States, jumped out of the plane early today
and escaped, a radio station reported.
   Privately owned Radio Haiti-Inter said the 20-year-old soldier,
Pvt. Gerald Pierre, fled the American Airlines Airbus A300 around
1:10 a.m.
   Officials gave no immediate explanation of how the soldier got
away. There was speculation the army allowed him to escape as a way
to resolve peacefully the three-day siege, which had closed the
international airport.
   ``The Army High Command conducted the operation. They haven't
given their report yet,'' Alfred Mentor, director of Haiti's
Information Ministry, said this morning.
   The army had no immediate comment, and it was not known whether
there was any attempt to search for Pierre.
   Haiti-Inter, whose reporter witnessed the escape, said Pierre
leaped from the plane in the early-morning darkness and raced
across the tarmac toward a field of high grass opposite the
terminal.
   Soldiers and police were guarding the airport but had not
surrounded the 10-foot-high perimeter fence, and Pierre could have
fled over an unguarded portion of it.
   Officials reopened the airport today. It was closed Wednesday
after Pierre reportedly fired a machine gun in the direction of a
Haiti Trans-Air flight shortly after it landed on a flight from
Miami.
   Radio Metropole said Pierre shot at the plane, but Information
Minister Carlo Desinor said the soldier shot at the tarmac and not
at the plane.
   The U.S. Embassy said American Airlines would send investigators
to examine the jet before it left the airport.
   On Wednesday, Pierre appeared on the steps of the Airbus several
times, firing into the air then ducking back inside, radio reports
said.
   About 300 people, mostly supporters, crowded outside a fence
about 20 yards from the runway and waved and cheered when he
appeared at the plane's door. The soldier waved back.
   ``Hang on!'' some shouted.
   ``We are sympathetic because any means are justified to escape
our poverty,'' said a taxi driver.
   Pierre had allowed passengers and crew members to leave the New
York-bound Flight 658 on Monday shortly after commandeering the
jet. On Tuesday, he threatened on to blow up the plane unless he
was flown to United States, Radio Haiti-Inter said.
   Radio reports said Pierre, who also was an airport security
guard, was carrying grenades and the submachine gun when he took
control of the U.S. plane.
   Pierre was trying to desert after being reprimanded by an
officer for alleged insubordination, the reports said. He had
served in the army two years.
   Radio Metropole said military authorities had offered Pierre
immunity from prosecution if he surrendered and resigned from the
army.

   President Bush is planning to visit five South
America countries later this year, the White House announced
Thursday.
   The final itinerary and dates have not been set, but Bush
``hopes to visit Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Venezuela,''
said presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   The trip will take place sometime ``after the summer,'' he said.
   Bush himself had said recently he hoped to visit South America.
There have been widespread reports the trip would take place in
mid-September.
   Asked if Bush might stop in Nicaragua as well, Fitzwater said,
``Anything could happen. We could add a lot of countries before
this is over.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle recently returned from a trip to five
South American countries and the Caribbean island of Barbados. It
was Quayle's sixth trip to Latin America.
   Bush visited Costa Rica for a Latin summit last October and
Colombia for a drug summit in February.
   Brazil and Chile inaugurated new presidents last month.

   The White House renewed a veto threat today
against a major bill to combat job discrimination, saying ``we are
for civil rights legislation, we are simply not for that bill.''
   The measure is headed for Senate action after sailing through
committee with support from lawmakers of both parties.
   ``We need to send a clear message to the American people and the
message is that we will not tolerate a retreat on civil rights,''
Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said as the Senate Labor and
Human Resources Committee approved the bill Wednesday, 11-5.
   Civil rights organizations have been calling for such a measure
as a way of overcoming six Supreme Court decisions last year that
they say represent a setback in the fight against discrimination in
the workplace.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater reiterated the veto
threat, saying, ``We are interested in correcting problems which
arose from last year's Supreme Court cases. ... We are for civil
rights legislation. We are simply not for that bill.''
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in a letter to Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy, D-Mass., that he and other senior advisers would urge
Bush to veto the bill if it reaches his desk.
   Thornburgh said the administration ``opposes as inconsistent
with equal opportunity any legislation that would encourage quota
systems or otherwise divide our society along racial lines.''
   The administration has been calling for a more modest version.
   Civil rights forces said they already have enough votes to win
in the Senate, where the bill now has 40 cosponsors, and the House
as well.
   The bill would ban racial discrimination in all workplace
activities, including hiring, promotion, demotion and firing. It
would bar on-the-job harassment, which the Supreme Court has said
is not covered by federal law.
   Under the bill, employers would be held liable for actions in
which discrimination was a motivating factor, even if those
decisions had been made for non-discriminatory reasons. It also
would provide means of locking in settlements in civil rights suits
that otherwise might be reopened later.
   The bill would expand the right of employees to challenge a
seniority system adopted for discriminatory reasons.
   Perhaps the bill's most controversial feature would effectively
negate a Supreme Court decision last year involving a salmon
cannery in Alaska. Until that ruling, those showing statistical
evidence in court of hiring discrimination could force employers to
change their practices or justify them on the basis of business
necessity.
   In the so-called Wards Cove decision, however, the court said
that those filing discrimination suits must show that such hiring
practices were not based upon business necessity.
   In his letter to Kennedy, Thornburgh said the ``administration
is determined to help root out racial bias and bigotry.'' But he
said that if the measure ``were presented to the president in its
current form, I and other senior advisers would recommend that it
be vetoed.''
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, told the committee the bill would go
much further than overturning the Supreme Court decisions.
   ``It is, in my view, a radical reworking of our nation's basic
employment anti-discrimination law,'' Hatch said. ``Hiring the most
qualified person will not be a satisfactory explanation if an
employer's numbers are not right.''
   Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., said the panel should ``find
harmony and conciliation in the workplace,'' but that under the
legislation ``we simply add litigation.''
   Several other Republicans, however, are cosponsors of the
measure.
   ``If this committee did not move and this Congress did not move
on this issue, this administration would not either,'' said Sen.
David Durenberger, R-Minn., who voted in favor of the bill along
with Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt.
   Durenberger said his remark did not reflect on the
administration's commitment to civil rights, but he applauded the
lawmakers for ``putting the pressure on the rest of this process.''

<TEXT>
   Harry Goodridge, whose 25-year friendship
with Andre the seal captivated people in New England and beyond,
has died. He was 74.
   Goodridge, a tree surgeon and professional scuba diver, dead at
a Rockport hospital Wednesday. The cause of death was not given.
   Over the years, Andre's antics delighted fans who followed his
annual spring swim from his winter home in southern New England to
Rockport Harbor.
   Goodridge found Andre in 1961 as a 2-day-old pup apparently
abandoned by its mother.
   During the summers, Andre was kept in a floating pen and
entertained thousands of summer visitors by performing a repertory
of tricks with Goodridge.
   But when Andre was allowed to run free in the winter, his habit
of clambering aboard anchored dinghies and sinking them annoyed
fishermen, prompting Goodridge to ship his pal to aquariums in
Boston or Mystic, Conn., for the winter.
   With the end of winter, the seal was released for a swim back up
the coast to Rockport that became an annual event.
   Andre died in 1986 after he was spotted with bruises apparently
suffered in a fight with another male seal. The 5-foot, 250-pound
seal was buried in a pasture behind Goodridge's home.
   ``Many seals may live longer but few live as full a life as
Andre,'' Goodridge said at the time.
   Goodridge is survived by his wife, Thalice, a son and four
daughters.
   A funeral service will be held Saturday.

<HEAD>Soviet Says $320 Billion Needed To Cope With Chernobyl
Consequences</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A member of the Soviet Parliament said Thursday
that about $320 billion will be needed to cope with the
consequences of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster during the next 10
years.
   Yuri Shtsherbak, vice chairman of the Supreme Soviet's
Commission on Environment and Nuclear Energy, told reporters an
international fund should be set up to assist the Soviet Union.
   Shtsherbak said almost 4 million people are still living in
regions with higher than normal levels of radiation. The accident
occurred April 26, 1986 at the power plant, in the Soviet Ukraine.
   Shtsherbak's commission came up with proposals at the request of
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. They include a call for the
immediate evacuation of more than 100,000 people in the most
contaminated areas of Byelorussia, the Ukraine and the Russian
republic, according to Shtsherbak.
   He said the thyroid glands of more than 1.5 million people,
including 160,000 children, were exposed to ``important levels of
radiation'' after the Chernobyl disaster. In the Ukraine, the
incidence of thyroid cancer was expected to increase as much as
10-fold, Shtsherbak said.
   There are also considerably more cases of Leukemia and immunity
deficiencies. ``We call that Chernobyl AIDS,'' he added. ``We
believe this is only the beginning.''
   People in the affected region ``are living under great nervous
stress, socially, politically and psychologically,'' he said.
   Shtsherbak said his commission proposed that the government
issue a worldwide appeal for contributions to an international
Chernobyl relief fund. The estimate of needed funds over the next
decade was based on surveys made by the three republics affected.
   According to official figures, 31 people were killed in the
Chernobyl accident, caused by an explosion at the No. 4 reactor of
the four-unit plant.
   By 1989, officials said more than 250 people who had worked at
the plant or who were involved in the post-accident cleanup had
died of various causes, not all of them necessarily traceable to
radiation exposure.

   The legislature today restored King
Baudouin as the country's monarch at the end of a two-day
suspension he requested to avoid having to sign a law legalizing
abortion in Belgium.
   At a joint session of Parliament's two chambers, 245 legislators
voted to return the king to the throne.
   There were no votes against the monarch, but 93 lawmakers
abstained and 58 were absent. The two chambers contain 396
legislators.
   A simple majority of 199 was required to restore King Baudouin
to power.
   At the request of King Baudouin, a devout Catholic, the
government suspended the monarch on Wednesday, then passed the
abortion bill itself and called on the legislature to restore the
king.
   The meaneuver let King Baudouin follow his conscience by not
giving royal assent to the abortion bill. Such assent turns bills
into laws.
   Before the vote, Prime Minister Wilfried Martens said his
center-left government will seek changes in the constitution to
prevent future refusals by the king, on moral grounds, to endorse
legislation.
   He did not elaborate in comments to the joint session of the
184-meber Senate and 212-member Chamber of Representatives.
   However, the government may want the monarchy's powers, already
largely ceremonial, reduced even further, possibly by removing the
need to give bills royal assent before they become law.

<TEXT>
   In a major setback to peace
hopes, leaders of four black homelands pulled out of talks today
with President F.W. de Klerk on ending unrest and dismantling
white-minority rule.
   Constitutional Development Minister Gerrit Viljoen said four of
the six invited homeland chiefs withdrew under pressure from
opposition groups. He said the pressure amounted to
``intimidation'' but gave no details.
   African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela arrived today in
Cape Town for a separate meeting with de Klerk to consider ways to
revive negotiations on ending white minority rule.
   Meanwhile, the government in Venda, one of the four nominally
independent homelands which were not invited to the de Klerk talks,
was overthrown in a military coup today, according to a radio
announcement by coup leader Gabriel Ramushwana. The deputy chief of
the Venda Defense Force said he wanted the tiny homeland, which was
declared an independent republic in 1979, to be reincorporated into
South Africa.
   Mandela's discussion with de Klerk may lead to rescheduling the
canceled April 11 talks between the government and exiled ANC
leaders, said Patrick Lekota, spokesman for the ANC-affiliated
United Democratic Front.
   ``We are hopeful that the state president will be able to
respond in such a way as for the movement to be able to salvage the
discussions that were scheduled for April 11,'' Lekota said.
   Kwazulu chief minister Magosuthu Buthelezi and Kwa Kwa chief
minister T.K. Mopeli turned up for the talks. Buthelezi heads the
Zulu Tribe's conservative Inkatha movement and is seen as Mandela's
main black rival.
   De Klerk met first with Buthelezi and heads of the majority
parties in the white, Asian and colored or mixed-race parliaments.
   Allan Hendrickse, head of the Labor Party in the colored
parliament, said Mandela had asked him to pull out of the talks
with de Klerk. He said he would attend but ask de Klerk to adjourn
until all homeland leaders could attend.
   South Africa has three parliaments _ for whites, Asians and
colored voters. There is no parliament for blacks, who do not have
the vote.
   The homelands were set up by the white-minority government as
separate areas for blacks. Most black opposition groups, including
ANC elements, oppose the homelands' conservative governments and
have helped organize resistance against them.
   The ANC and other opposition groups want the homelands
reintegrated into South Africa. The regions have been hit by major
unrest and the military has seized power in Transkei and Ciskei.
   Four homelands are now officially independent nations _ though
they are recognized by no foreign government _ and six are
classified as self-governing and were invited to today's talks.
   The South African government says the homeland leaders must be
included in negotiations on the country's future.
   Government leaders had hoped today's meetings would help revive
efforts to start full-scale negotiations on sharing political power
with blacks. De Klerk has pledged to end apartheid.
   Talks set for next Wednesday collapsed when the ANC pulled out
to protest the police killing of nine blacks during a March 26
demonstration in the black township of Sebokeng outside
Johannesburg. The ANC said it would agree to talks once the
government brought the police under control.
   Mandela later agreed to a private meeting with de Klerk. He said
he wanted to discuss ways to end the wave of violence across South
Africa that has claimed hundreds of lives in recent weeks.
   Mandela told a news conference Wednesday he could not say when
full-scale talks with the government might be rescheduled.
   ``That will depend on the result of the discussions we are going
to have tomorrow,'' he said, adding that the ANC remained committed
to negotiations.
   ``We would not work so hard over three years to secure a meeting
between the ANC and the government if we were now going to turn
around'' and refuse to talk, Mandela said.
   He and other ANC leaders have charged police with favoring
Buthelezi's relatively conservative Inkatha movement in fighting
among rival black factions in Natal province. The fighting has
claimed some 4,000 lives since 1986.
   Police said today that the situation around Edendale in Natal
province was quiet after a week of savage black factional fighting
left at least 58 people dead. The fighting pitted Inkatha against
ANC-backed groups.

   About 50 armed Soviet soldiers dressed as
policemen stormed the Lithuanian Prosecutor's Office today,
expelled its employees and occupied the building, said witnesses
and spokesmen for the republic's Parliament.
   The incident occurred one day after Lithuania's secessionist
government accused the Kremlin of backing forces bent on its
overthrow.
   Lithuania and Moscow have faced off in a tense showdown since
the republic declared independence March 11. Statements in recent
days indicated movement toward a common ground, including a
possible referendum by Lithuanians.
   But today, men armed with automatic weapons entered the
Prosecutor's Office, site of a previous Soviet attempt to seize
authority from officials appointed by the breakway republic's
government.
   The men ``fully occupied the building, and there are six or
eight paratroopers on each floor dressed as policemen,'' Henrika
Pocei, secretary to Lithuania's chief prosecutor, said in a
telephone interview from Vilnius.
   A bulletin put out by the Lithuanian Supreme Council legislature
quoted Kazimieras Motieka, deputy head of the Parliament, as saying
soldiers were ``dressed in police uniforms and carried boxes of
ammunition with them into the building.''
   The chief prosecutor is the republic's top law-enforcement
authority. A confrontation arose at the same offices last week when
Moscow officials tried to remove Arturas Paulauskas, the chief
prosecutor appointed by the new Lithuanian government, and install
their own man.
   Employees refused to obey the Moscow loyalist, and several
soldiers were stationed in the building Friday in the first
occupation by Soviet troops of a Lithuanian government building.
Soldiers had previously taken control of several Communist Party
buildings.
   ``The Soviet Union, with the aid of its army, supports a small
group of its political supporters which is attempting to restore
the old structures of the Soviet administration,'' Lithuania's
Parliament said in a statement Wednesday.
   ``There is therefore a threat to overthrow the legally elected
authority and the government,'' said the statement, broadcast on
Lithuanian radio.
   In London, the republic's de facto spokesman expressed a
willingness to agree to concessions, including a continued Soviet
military presence, the retention of economic ties with Moscow and a
referendum on independence.
   The announcement came from Algis Cekuolis, a foreign affairs
adviser to Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis, and was the
first such public offer from the Lithuanians.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev declared Saturday that Moscow
would not negotiate with the Lithuanians unless they repeal their
March 11 declaration of independence.
   Landsbergis responded by saying the declaration was not
negotiable but otherwise struck a conciliatory tone. On Tuesday,
high-ranking Kremlin and Lithuanian officials met for the first
time on the issue, indicating both sides were seeking compromise
after weeks of tense confrontation.
   However, more informal Moscow talks slated for Wednesday were
postponed without explanation and word emerged of Gorbachev's harsh
message to the new premier of Lithuania's equally
independence-minded Baltic neighbor, Estonia.
   On Tuesday night, Gorbachev told President Arnold Ruutel of
Estonia that the republic must back off from its declaration of
sovereignty, Ruutel said.
   Estonia, which Moscow forcibly annexed with fellow Baltic states
Lithuania and Latvia in 1940, is cautiously following Lithuania's
lead. On Friday, its new Parliament declared Estonia to be under
Soviet occupation and set an indefinite transition period for
independence.
   Ruutel, interviewed by Estonian radio, quoted Gorbachev as
saying, ``When I heard of your resolution I was completely beside
myself. You must declare the resolution null and void. It is an
invalid one.''
   ``It seems to me that I have to introduce similar measures as
those taken in Lithuania,'' he quoted Gorbachev as saying.
   Since Lithuania's independence declaration March 11, Red Army
convoys have rolled through the republic and troops have occupied
buildings and rounded up Lithuanian military deserters.
   In London, Cekuolis told a news conference that Landsbergis had
authorized him to publicize the proposed concessions in hopes of
starting formal negotiations with Moscow on its claim to
independent status.
   He said his government had decided to make the announcement in
what he referred to as the uncensored environment of a Western
capital. Most foreign reporters were forced to leave Lithuania on
Sunday.
   Cekuolis, who arrived in London from Moscow on Tuesday, listed
these proposed concessions:
   _Recognition of Soviet interests, but not rights, in the Baltic
states, ``maybe including a military presence.''
   _Soviet access to the Soviet city of Kaliningrad, from which it
would lose direct land access.
   _Soviet use of the Baltic ports, which are crucial to the Soviet
navy.
   _Retention of the present economic relations between Lithuania
and the Soviet Union.
   _A referendum on independence, a key demand of Gorbachev and an
element of a tough secession law passed by the Soviet Parliament on
Tuesday. The law also stipulates a five-year waiting period for
secession.
   Cekuolis did not have any meetings with British officials. Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's government has made it clear it does
not wish to complicate matters for Gorbachev over the difficult
issue of Lithuania.
   The Bush administration has likewise refrained from recognizing
Lithuania as independent, though it has expressed support for the
republic's right to self-determination.

   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev will hold a summit in the United States between May 30
and June 3, the two superpowers announced today as top-level
negotiations resumed on arms control treaties.
   ``I'm looking forward to meeting with him,'' Bush told reporters
a few hours after the formal announcement was made. ``It is very
important that we have these conversations.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters the summit
would be a ``tough love'' session that would deal with the
breakaway Soviet republic of Lithuania and perhaps result in
agreement on arms control issues, hopefully including a pact
limiting long-range strategic nuclear weapons.
   He also said it was hoped an agreement could be reached on
conventional troop levels in Europe, and added that U.S.-Soviet
trade would be on the agenda.
   The simultaneous announcements of the summit came from the White
House and the Soviet news agency Tass as Secretary of State James
A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze held
their second day of meetings.
   Bush said the conversations between Baker and the Soviet
diplomat were ``going reasonably well.'' The president is scheduled
to meet with Shevardnadze at the White House on Friday.
   Shevardnadze summed up his first two rounds of talks with Baker,
saying, ``I think it's going rather well.''
   As the morning session ended, Shevardnadze said he and Baker had
discussed ``the entire range of arms control issues'' as well as
``practical preparations for the summit.''
   The details of the summit were sketchy. Fitzwater said it may
not last five days, and offered little information on time and
specific locations.
   ``It could turn out to be a two or three-day summit, depending
on travel schedules,'' Fitzwater suggested. Bush had been expected
to deliver a commencement speech at the military academy at West
Point, N.Y. on May 31, and there has been talk that Gorbachev might
make a similar speech at Brown University in Providence, R.I.
   The spokesman said the crisis in Lithuania would ``undoubtedly
be an issue'' at the summit and that the president intended to
raise it. ``If anything, Lithuania makes the summit even more
important,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``I would characterize this summit more in terms of
demonstrating the kind of tough love working relationship that we
were able to develop with the Soviet Union by virtue of four or
five summits,'' the spokesman said.
   Lithuania aside, Bush and Gorbachev have planned the summit to
discuss three major arms control agreements dealing with long-range
nuclear missiles, chemical arms and troops and weapons in Europe.
The summit is also expected to include talks on such political
issues as the reunification of Germany.
   ``I'm very pleased the dates have been set,'' Bush said. ``It's
very important that we have these conversations. Dialogue is
important.''
   The two leaders hope to sign a treaty limiting long-range
nuclear missiles deployed on land, in submarines and aboard
bombers, but several knotty issues must be settled first.
   Baker and Shevardnadze both stressed how short a period there is
to prepare for the summit.
   ``There is very little time, only seven weeks,'' Shevardnadze
said. ``There is still a great amount of work to be done. And this
time the agenda, as everybody knows, is very extensive.''
   Baker agreed. ``Quite a bit of work remains to be done,'' he
said. ``We hope as far as our side is concerned, we will be able to
move forward on the full range of our agenda.''
   In the arms control field, Bush and Gorbachev may initial an
agreement for a phased reduction of American and Soviet chemical
weapons. But an international ban depends on agreement among more
than a score of nations negotiating terms in Geneva.
   The two leaders could set final terms for reducing U.S. and
Soviet troops, tanks and other conventional forces in Europe, but a
treaty would be finalized at a 35-nation summit meeting later in
the year, provided there is no hangup in negotiations.
   On the issue of German reunification, the Soviets are concerned
that merger of their ally, East Germany, with the NATO linchpin,
West Germany, would give the Western alliance a considerable
advantage over the Warsaw Pact.
   Bush and the allies are considering concessions, such as keeping
NATO troops out of what is now East Germany.
   On regional fronts, the two sides are backing opposing forces in
wars in Angola and Afghanistan and could be ready to strike
compromise deals.
   Summits generally are an occasion for superpower accords on such
issues as cultural and business exchanges, and this one may be as
well. Gorbachev also is seeking access to Western credit and
improved trade relations, and the subject of trade is certain to
come up.
   Bush and Gorbachev last met in early December on the island of
Malta in the Mediterranean and seemed to agree on a basis for U.S.
support for Gorbachev's program of reform within the Soviet Union.
   Since then, the drive for independence in Lithuania and other
regions of the Soviet Union has strained superpower relations, but
not to the extent that Bush would withdraw offers of U.S. technical
assistance.
   Meanwhile, Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said
after a meeting with Bush today that the Lithuanian situation could
make it ``a little more difficult'' to achieve new trade agreements
with the Soviet Union.
   ``The members of Congress in both parties might have a different
view if there's any force used in Lithuania about trade or anything
else dealing with the Soviet Union,'' he said.
   ``I don't know that it would spill over into arms control
agreements,'' said Dole.
   Fitzwater's announcement said:
   ``President Bush and President Gorbachev have agreed on dates
for holding their summit meeting in the United States. The summit
will take place during the dates of Wednesday, May 30, and Sunday,
June 3.''
   Tass said in a brief announcement: ``There is an agreement that
the visit of the Soviet President M.S. Gorbachev to the United
States would take place on May 30-June 3 this year.''

   Author E.L. Doctorow is the winner of the
PEN-Faulkner Award for best American fiction published in 1989 for
his eighth novel, ``Billy Bathgate,'' the Folger Shakespeare
Library announced Thursday.
   Doctorow, 59, a professor at New York University, will receive a
$7,500 cash prize at an awards ceremony May 12 at the library,
which administers the awards. Four finalists will receive $2,500
each.
   Doctorow's award-winning novel is about a young man from the
Bronx who becomes the protege of the infamous 1930s gangster, Dutch
Schultz. Doctorow previously had won the National Book Critics
Circle Award for ``Billy Bathgate'' and ``Ragtime'' and the
National Book Award for ``World's Fair.''
   The PEN-Faulkner Award was founded by American writers 10 years
ago to pay tribute to novelist William Faulkner, who used his Nobel
Prize money to encourage other writers. The award is associated
with the American branch of PEN, the international writers'
organization whose name is an acronym for poets, playwrights,
editors, essayists and novelists.
   The four other nominees who also will be honored at the May 12
ceremony are Russell Banks, Molly Gloss, Josephine Jacobsen and
Lynne Sharon Schwartz.

   A book that Marc Christian, the ex-lover of
Rock Hudson, claims has defamed him as criminal and psychotic
``speaks for itself,'' a spokesman for the publisher said Thursday.
   Christian, who won $5.5 million from the Hudson estate a year
ago in a landmark AIDS lawsuit, filed a $22 million lawsuit
Wednesday against the book's two authors and New York-based Pharos
Books.
   The Tom Clark and Dick Kleiner book ``Rock Hudson, Friend of
Mine,'' released last month, referred to Christian as ``a criminal,
a thief, an unclean person, a blackmailer, a psychotic, an
extortionist, a forger, a perjurer, a liar, a whore, an arsonist
and a squatter,'' Christian's lawsuit said.
   It was filed by celebrity lawyer Marvin Mitchelson.
   ``The book speaks for itself,'' said Martha Clark, a Pharos
spokeswoman.
   A jury ruled in 1989 that Hudson committed ``outrageous
conduct'' for concealing his AIDS diagnosis from Christian, his
lover for two years.

   He's best known for playing the Catskills
Casanova in ``Dirty Dancing,'' but Patrick Swayze says he'd prefer
the roles that once went to stars such as Spencer Tracy or Gene
Kelly.
   ``I want to have a career like Spencer Tracy, Robert DeNiro,
Gene Kelly, Omar Sharif. I want to do roles that have a positive
impact,'' Swayze said in an interview to be published in Sunday's
Parade magazine. ``With the state the world is in, I'm looking for
a hero.''
   Swayze, 37, found a hero when he was growing up.
   ``I used my father as a pattern, and the things he believed in
and stood for are still important,'' said Swayze, whose father died
in 1982. The two were very close, and Swayze recalled his father
was ``always there'' during his childhood.
   ``He was a very neat man, a very gentle man. I got a very
intense side from my mother and a very gentle side from my
father,'' he said. ``Without the input of either of them, I'd never
be who I am today.''

   Ivana Trump, whose estranged husband Donald said
he paid her $1 a year and all the dresses she wanted for running
the Plaza Hotel, plans to make fashion her business, Women's Wear
Daily reported Thursday.
   Mrs. Trump has decided to launch her own collections of
ready-to-wear clothing, accessories, jewelry and luggage in 1992,
according to the trade daily.
   Mrs. Trump refused to say who will manufacture these
collections, WWD reported, but insisted they will be made by ``top
companies around the world.'' She said her licensing arrangements
were being negotiated by ``a major licensing company,'' which she
wouldn't name, according to the daily.
   Her spokesman, John Scanlon, said he had not seen the WWD
report. He said Mrs. Trump ``has received a large number of offers
to endorse a number of products and she is examining all of them.''
   During Seventh Avenue's fashion week, Mrs. Trump has presided at
the Plaza over the shows of Oscar de la Renta, Arnold Scaasi,
Carolina Herrera, Rebecca Moses and Carolyne Roehm.
   It was her idea to attract them to the Plaza, which was
purchased by her billionaire developer husband.
   According to WWD, Mrs. Trump is spreading the word among
retailers about her plans to turn from fashion patroness to
designer.

Salt Lake City.
   Sebastian Bach, 21, leader of the New Jersey-based band, was
cited for using profane language, ``thrusting his pelvis toward the
crowd'' and having ``grasped his groin,'' according to a police
report.
   Officers were especially alarmed due to the large number of
audience members who were under 18, the report said.
   Bach was ticketed after the performance Saturday at the Salt

<HEAD>Foundation Says `Healthy,' `Alive' Conservative Movement Awaits
Another Reagan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conservatives are flourishing in America but
it will be some time before they have another Ronald Reagan to
cheer, leaders of a conservative think tank said Thursday.
   Top officials of the Heritage Foundation which had close ties to
the Reagan administration, released a ``State of Conservatism''
message, saying President Bush is following up on his predecessor's
conservative agenda but is no match for him at inspiring followers.
   ``George Bush might in fact come along at the end of four years
with an enactment record as conservative as Ronald Reagan's was at
the end of his first term, but clearly his rhetoric is not what
conservatives are looking for,'' said Heritage president Edwin J.
Feulner Jr.
   Feulner conceded that this is ``a problem in terms of building
and maintaining a movement.'' Nevertheless, he said, ``there are a
lot of good conservative institutions out there that are doing very
well.''
   ``Sure we miss Reagan,'' said Burton Yale Pines, senior vice
president of the foundation. ``Democrats for a half century have
been looking for a successor to Franklin Roosevelt. ... We're going
to be looking for a long time for the next Ronald Reagan.''
   ``I think it is going to take a while for a new political person
to come along to build on the Reagan legacy and claim that turf,''
said Feulner. ``I don't see him out there today.''
   Feulner said Roosevelt's New Deal, formulated in the 1930's, did
not come to fruition until the Johnson administration's Great
Society in the 1960's.
   ``Similarly,'' he said,``because Ronald Reagan came to town and
enunciated some radically different and new ideas, it would be
utopian for conservatives to think that by the time he left town in
January 1989, those ideas would all be in place. It's going to be a
long-term process.
   ``Critics from the left and the right are saying that we are
cracking up or that we have lost our cohesion, but I believe the
conservative movement is healthy, alive and well today,'' Feulner
said.
   He conceded, however, that conservatives ``are in a difficult
bind ... between those who believe a certain level of the welfare
state is more or less acceptable'' and those who do not. He said
Heritage believes ``there is a certain minimal role of government
that conservatives, at least those involved in the policy process
in Washington, ought to be willing to accept and try and promote
new ways of looking at these problems.
   ``It is almost a generational kind of question,'' said Feulner,
a veteran of the conservative movement who has headed Heritage
since 1977. ``We are being accused by our successors of being
rather squishy.''
   He said this conflict is ``in some respects personified'' in the
contrast betwen Reagan's rhetoric and Bush's, yet, ``I see the two
of them, in terms of their policies, basically one following the
other.''
   In the message, distributed in advance of the meeting, Feulner
wrote that Reagan ``sought power to give it away _ to states,
localities, private enterprise, and institutions that ... make
Americans actively involved citizens instead of resentful
taxpayers.''
   ``In view of the obstacles he confronted, it's amazing he got as
far as he did,'' Feulner said. ``But it wasn't far beyond the
starting blocks.''
   In domestic affairs, the foundation president urged
conservatives to press for such things as ``giving parents the
freedom to choose the schools their children attend, empowering
tenants to manage the public housing projects where they live, and
providing business incentives to invest in poor inner-city
neighborhoods.''
   Turning to world affairs, he said that ``because of our success
in rolling back communism, there is no longer much consensus on
what constitutes a ``conservative foreign policy.''
   ``This isn't the place to set forth a new conservative foreign
policy agenda,'' he added. ``But it is the place to acknowledge
that in an era when even many communists have turned
anti-communist, anti-communism is no longer enough to unify and
energize conservatives.''
   The message was published by the foundation, under the title
``Conservatism in a New Age,'' as a supplement to its annual report.

   A tractor-trailer plowed into a herd of
elk that attempted to cross Interstate 90, killing 10 cows and one
calf, police said.
   The elk ran into the front and side of the truck early Wednesday
in the westbound lanes about five miles west of Cle Elum, the
Washington State Patrol reported.
   The driver, Jimmy McDaniel of Waco, Texas, was not injured, the
patrol said. The truck sustained an estimated $20,000 worth of
damage.
   The adult animals weigh between 500 and 700 pounds, said
wildlife agent Steve Rogers. Such road kills are routinely dumped,
but salvageable meat goes to the county jail, he said.
   Elk migrate through the area each spring and fall, and a herd of
about 40 had been in a pasture along the highway for several days,
Rogers said.
   Rogers said he would watch the herd for injured animals.
   Cle Elum is about 75 miles east of Seattle.

<HEAD>Bush Takes Another Step Toward Normal Relations With Panama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Thursday lifted the state of
emergency against Panama, a formal step toward returning to normal
trade and economic relations.
   The state of emergency was imposed April 8, 1988, during the
regime of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. He was deposed during the
U.S. invasion in December and a new government was installed.
   Although no elections have been held since then, the Bush
administration considers the U.S.-installed government to be
democratically elected.
   That is because President Guillermo Endara was seen by
independent observers as the obvious winner in last May's election,
which was invalidated by Noriega.
   ``The restoration of a democratically elected government in
Panama has ended the unusual and extraordinary threat to the
national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States
previously posed by the policies and actions of Manuel Antonio
Noriega in that country, and the need to continue the national
emergency,'' Bush said in an executive order lifting the state of
emergency.
   Thursday's move came as Bush continued to press for $500 million
in emergency aid for Panama to help get its economy back on track
and aid the Endara government's recovery from the invasion damage.
   The House this week approved a $420 million package. The Senate
seems unlikely to act on the measure before leaving Thursday for
the Easter recess, as Bush had hoped.
   The state of emergency order, imposed by then-President Reagan,
had led to withholding U.S. payments to Panama for operations of
the Panama Canal and froze an estimated $400 million worth of
Panamanian assets in U.S. banks besides hampering Panamanian trade
with the United States.
   Bush imposed further sanctions, including prohibiting ships
flying the Panamanian flag from entering U.S. ports.
   In advance of Thursday's announcement, however, Bush had
unfrozen the Panamanian bank assets and effectively lifted all
other sanctions.

   Mood music, subliminal messages and other
secret devices may be deployed to get the best out of the slimy
contestants in the Come See Me Mayor's Frog Jump.
   Twelve Jumbo Grassfrogs have been imported from Brownsville in
Marlboro County for Saturday's contest.
   In the main contest, which is open to the public, the frogs must
be of the garden variety.
   Amphibian hostess Joyce Moss picked up the box of imported frogs
at the Post Office on Wednesday.
   ``They're ugly. Ooooh, they're nasty. Put them back,'' she
yelped.
   Ms. Moss followed instructions on the box: do not refrigerate,
keep away from heat. She said the frogs will rest in a garbage can
at her home, assuring race officials that it's an environment
conducive to concentration and high performance.
   The out-of-town frog will undergo several practice sessions at
Cherry Park.
   ``In years past, we've exercised them so they don't become
lethargic before the big day,'' city spokesman John Grant said. The
contest committee may pump in mood music, subliminal messages and
other ``secret weapons'' to get them hopping, Grant said.

   The colony swells in midsummer to about 750,000 Mexican
free-tailed bats who live in 16-inch-deep grooves running the
length of the bridge over Town Lake.
   The city's Park and Recreation Department and Bat Conservation
International plan to open a kiosk with educational display panels
on the north shore of the lake on April 20. The nocturnal mammals

   An apparently impatient customer waiting in

   The victim, Dale Brantley Peeler, and his girlfriend, Patricia

said.
   Peeler got out of his car and walked back to see what the

exchanged words, he said.
   The passenger in the second vehicle also got out and fired two
shots, hitting Peeler once in the chest, Wilhelm said.

   The upcoming U.S.-Soviet summit may have been
the big story of the day, but President Bush didn't let that get in
the way of his opportunity to be photographed Thursday with rock
star Michael Jackson.
   In fact he let Jackson become part of the summit story. The
black-and-crimson clad singer, sporting shiny, silver ornaments on
his black boots, stood at the president's side outside the Oval
Office as Bush made the first comments about his newly announced
May 30-June 3 summit meeting with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   White House aides said Bush invited Jackson to the White House
to congratulate him on being named entertainer of the decade by the
Capital Children's Museum in Washington.
   The flamboyantly dressed Jackson, face framed by shoulder-length
curls and dark sunglasses, stood out in the phalanx of dark-suited
White House aides who accompanied the president and first lady
Barbara Bush to the Rose Garden for the occasion.
   ``I just wanted to welcome Michael Jackson here. And, named
artist of the decade, and he has a tremendous following,'' Bush
said before expressing his pleasure about the upcoming summit.
   ``He does good work _ what we call the `points of light'
concept. I just wanted to bring him out here and officially welcome
him to the White House once again.
   ``Glad you're here, sir,'' Bush said, turning to the recording
artist, and shaking on of his black-gloved hands.
   Jackson smiled and laughed as Bush made brief remarks to
reporters about the upcoming summit, but said nothing to reporters.
   Meeting the president did not end the rock star's day at the
White House. He also had his photo taken with Vice President Dan
Quayle in Quayle's office, got a tour of the White House from Mrs.
Bush, visited the Secret Service offices, and autographed some
Easter eggs for the White House annual Easter egg roll.
   In a 10-minute Oval Office meeting with Bush, the singer
presented the president with a collection of his recordings on
compact disc.
   ``They had a very amiable chat,'' said White House liaison
office aide Joe Watkins. ``Mrs. Bush complimented him on his boots.
He said `I like your dress.'''
   The first lady wore a black-and-white checked spring suit.
   Dozens of staff members gathered in the Rose Garden and on the
steps of the Old Executive Office Building to catch a glimpse of
Jackson.
   Offices in the Old Executive, which houses Quayle's main office,
were virtually emptied as workers, many of them with their children
in tow, crowded the halls to see and cheer the singer, according to
his publicist Lee Solters.
   ``There was a lot of screaming and yelling _ adults and kids
alike,'' as Jackson shook hands with the fans, Solters said.
   Jackson wore slim black slacks with red stripes down the sides,
a short black, braided jacket in the style of a high school band
leader, emblazoned with a red arm band.
   A large silvery bauble was pinned to his chest.
   He left the Rose Garden with Mrs. Bush and her daughter-in-law
Margaret Bush and strolled to the White House residence quarters.
   Mrs. Bush showed him the Lincoln bedroom, which Jackson had
particularly wanted to see, said Watkins.
   Later Quayle brought Jackson out onto a balcony of his office
building where he appeared to the throng of reporters and
photographers below to be pointing out landmarks on the grounds.
   The singer ducked into his white limousine without answering
reporters shouts. But he stopped the car on the White House
driveway, rolling the darkened electric window down a few inches to
extend two gloved fingers in a peace sign and murmured, ``Hi. I
love you.'' With that, his car drove out onto Pennsylvania Avenue.
   Bush had an Oval Office photo session Thursday with another
musician friend, country singer Randy Travis. But Travis slipped in
and out quietly without much ado.

<HEAD>Unfavorable Factors Warn National Firefighters Worst Season is
Ahead</HEAD>

   Firefighting experts across the country are
bracing for what could become the worst fire season in the nation's
history, the result of drought, hurricane debris and a lack of
manpower.
   Representatives of the Army, Air Force, National Guard, Forest
Service, Bureau of Land Management and other federal agencies met
at the Boise Interagency Fire Center this week to assess the threat
of range and forest fires nationwide this summer.
   The Boise Center is charged with coordinating firefighting
efforts nationwide.
   Jack Wilson, the center's director, said the western states are
suffering their sixth year of drought.
   ``The moisture is real low in most areas in the West. If we get
the lightning, we're in trouble,'' he said.
   In 1988, widespread lightning storms over the West contributed
to fires that burned more than 5 million acres nationwide,
including about 700,000 to 1 million acres in Yellowstone National
Park.
   The center says the nation's worst fire year in terms of total
acreage burned was 1926 when 28 million acres of land was charred.
   In the Southeast, Hurricane Hugo last year cut a wide swath
through South Carolina. The storm's powerful wind knocked down
trees and brush over 6-million acres.
   ``It's dead and down and that makes it doubly dangerous,''
Wilson said.
   He said the region generally has about 100 tons of dead trees
and brush per acre, but in the wake of Hugo, the potential fire
fuel has more than doubled.
   ``If it gets going, it's going to be a disaster. I'm looking for
a rough, tough year,'' Wilson said.
   Adding to the problem is a lack of manpower. Nearly 2,000 fewer
civilian firefighters will be available the fires this summer,
officials said.
   ``Timber programs and other competing programs have taken up the
manpower. They're just not available this summer and may not be for
the next five years,'' Wilson said.
   Sixty-three ``hotshot'' crews, well-trained first-attack
firefighting teams of about 20 people each, will lead the nation's
firefighting efforts along with 395 smoke jumpers.
   Including support crews, nearly 20,000 firefighters will be on
line for this season's blazes, but Wilson expects more will be
needed.
   ``Most of the time, civilian firefighting forces are more than
adequate, but in the event it becomes necessary to call for
military help, we want to be ready to do that.''

<HEAD>U.S. Companies Plan Big Boost in Foreign Capital Spending</HEAD>

   American companies plan to boost their
overseas capital spending by 13 percent this year, up substantially
from a 2 percent increase projected six months ago, the government
said Thursday.
   The Commerce Department said a survey conducted in December
showed that majority-owned foreign affiliates of U.S. companies
plan to spend $54.9 billion after increases of 14 percent in 1989
and 24 percent in 1988.
   The increases over the three years are widespread by area and
industry, the department said, reflecting parent companies' growing
emphasis on overseas operations.
   Manufacturing affiliates said they plan a 17 percent boost to
$27.4 billion in 1990, up from 2 percent in the previous survey
last June. That compares to a 15 percent gain in 1989.
   The department said all manufacturing industries plan increases.
   ``Manufacturers have been attracted by favorable conditions
abroad, including increasing European economic integration and
rapid economic growth in East Asia,'' it continued.
   The largest manufacturing increases were in primary and
fabricated metals, non-electrical machinery and transportation
equipment.
   The boost in primary and fabricated metals is mainly for
construction and expansion of aluminium smelters in Canada, the
department said.
   ``In transportation equipment, European manufacturers of
automobiles are expanding capacity in anticipation of market growth
related to the 1992 single-market initiative of the European
Communities,'' it added. ``That initiative is also encouraging
spending in non-electrical machinery, particularly by European
computer-manufacturing affiliates.''
   The department said petroleum affiliates plan an 8 percent
increase to $15.6 billion after boosting spending 9 percent in
1989. Those affiliates had said they planned a 6 percent boost in
spending in the initial survey.
   ``Petroleum firms have been slowing their domestic capital
spending for exploration and development and they have been
shifting these activities overseas, partly in response to
environmental concerns in the United States,'' it reported.
   In addition, petroleum spending ``reflects rising world oil
prices resulting from increasing worldwide demand and declining
production in the United States and the Soviet Union.''
   Affiliates in developed countries plan to increase expenditures
13 percent to $42.3 billion after a 10 percent gain in 1989.
Affiliates in developing countries plan a 15 percent boost to $11.7
billion following a 15 percent advance a year earlier.

   Retired Lt. Gen. Frank Tharin, a hero
of the battle of Wake Island who later went on to many Marine Corps
air commands, has died after a long illness. He was 79.
   Tharin, a Laguna Beach resident, died March 21 in San Rafael,
where he had been hospitalized for eight months.
   The Marine aviator won the Silver Star, the Distinguished Flying
Cross, two Air Medals and a Purple Heart for helping sink a
Japanese cruiser and downing enemy fighters during the 17-day fight
over Wake Island. The tiny Pacific atoll fell to the Japanese Dec.
23, 1941.
   Tharin was captured and held as a prisoner of war in Hokkaido,
Japan, until the war ended.
   Tharin served as commanding general of the Eastern and Western
region Marine Corps air bases, and of all three active-duty Marine
aircraft wings _ the 1st, in Iwakuni, Japan; the 2nd, in Cherry
Point, N.C., and the 3rd, at El Toro, Calif.
   He served at El Toro as commanding general of the 3rd Marine
Aircraft Wing from October 1962 to June 1963, returning as
commander of Marine Corps Air Bases West from 1964 to 1967.
   He retired in 1970.
   Tharin is survived by his wife, Betty Gross Tharin; three sons,
Frank of Fremont, Felix of Laguna Beach and Michael of Novato; and
three grandchildren.
   A memorial service was planned for Saturday.

<HEAD>Kodak Fined $2.15 Million for Environmental Violations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastman Kodak Co. was fined $2.15 million
in criminal and civil penalties on Thursday for violating New
York's environmental laws.
   The photographic giant pleaded guilty in Rochester City Court to
two misdemeanor violations for illegally disposing of hazardous
waste and failing to report the spill of a toxic solvent until five
days after it was discovered.
   The $1 million criminal fine is the largest ever assessed by New
York in an environmental case and among the largest in the nation,
said state Attorney General Robert Abrams.
   The incidents occurred in 1986 and 1987 at the 2,200-acre Kodak
Park manufacturing center for film and photographic products. The
illegal hazardous waste disposal was one of a series of violations,
said Assistant state Attorney General Paul McCarthy.
   Under a plea agreement, Kodak was fined $1 million in criminal
penalties for the two violations, plus $150,000 to be paid to local
emergency planning committees.
   Kodak also signed a consent order with the state Department of
Environmental Conservation. Under that order, the company will pay
an additional $1 million in civil penalties and begin an extensive
clean-up of Kodak Park.
   But Judge Herman J. Walz criticized the agreement for letting
Kodak's officers off the hook.
   ``When a corporation pleads guilty in exchange for an agreement
not to prosecute members of the corporation, then people who have
participated in a criminal act go unpunished,'' Walz said.
   ``In this court's view, so-called white collar criminals ought
to be punished as severely as any other criminal, and because such
criminal conduct frequently results in much more serious
consequences to society, perhaps more severely.''
   Kodak spokesman Ronald Roberts said the company had accepted
responsibility for the violations.
   ``We believe it is in the best interest of our company, our
employees, and the community to put any problems behind us and
direct our attention to the many strong environmental programs to
which we are committed,'' Roberts said in a statement.
   Industry analysts said the fines would have little effect on the
company's finances.
   ``A fine of a couple million is peanuts to Eastman Kodak
Company,'' said Michael Ellmann of Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co. in New
York.
   McCarthy said Kodak had illegally contracted with an
unauthorized company to dispose of nearly 50,000 pounds of
silver-contaiminated soil in 1986. Kodak was fined $997,500 for
that violation _ double the profit it had made from the incident,
McCarthy said.
   The other charge involved a Feb. 5, 1987, spill of more than
5,000 gallons of a toxic solvent at one of Kodak's tank farms.
Kodak discovered the spill on Feb. 6, but did not notify the state
environmental office until Feb. 11.
   Kodak was fined $2,500 for that violation.
   The settlements are the result of nearly two years'
investigation after officials discovered in 1988 that chemical
leaks and spills had contaminated ground water under Kodak Park.
   Joseph Polito, a former leader of Concerned Neighbors of Kodak
Park, said he was disappointed with the size of the penalties
against Kodak.
   ``It's equivalent to you or I getting a jaywalking ticket,'' he
said.

   The U.N. secretary-general and a Brazilian
who has fought to protect his country's Indian tribes and rain
forests were among the winners Thursday of the 1990 Onassis awards.
   The four prestigious awards honor international contributions in
scholarship, human rights, and the environment.
   Javier Perez de Cuellar, the secretary-general of the United
Nations, received the main Athinai Prize for Man and Mankind ``in
recognition of his personal initiative toward resolving worldwide
crises.''
   Premier Xenophon Zolotas handed out the awards during a ceremony
in the nation's former Parliament building. Given by the Alexander
S. Onassis Public Benefit Foundation, each carries a prize of
$100,000.
   In his acceptance speech, Perez de Cuellar said that in dealing
with issues of international concern, ``we too often lose sight of
their human implications and moral dimension.''
   The other recipients were Ailton Krenak and the Union of Indian
Nations of Brazil; the city of Warsaw, Poland; and the Goulandris
Natural History Museum of Greece.
   In brief remarks, New York University President John Brademas
said Krenak is a ``resourceful, courageous leader in the effort to
protect the indigenous peoples of the Amazon region of Brazil and
the rain forests that are your homes.''
   Brademas lauded Krenak for training Indians to develop and
protect their culture, lands and other natural resources essential
to the survival of the native people and of the forests they
inhabit.
   Krenak, speaking in Portuguese, accused international
organizations, including the World Bank and the European Community,
of ignoring the 300,000 Amazon Indians when they sponsored a
worldwide campaign to integrate the Amazon to the international
market and the modern economy.
   In the Amazon today, Krenak said, ``you find farmers burning
ecological reserves, gold miners extracting gold from Indian areas,
Indians kicked out into the cities, rubber tappers living in the
slum peripheries, and governments implementing damn, roads and
railroads in the middle of the forest.
   ``What you do not see at all is a program directed to the
population, a program that admits that human beings exist,'' said
Krenak, whose family name is that of his Indian tribe.
   Stanislaw Wyganowski accepted the Aristotelis Prize for Man and
Culture on behalf of the city of Warsaw.
   The Polish capital was given the prize because of its
``exemplary restoration'' after its destruction during World War II.
   Angelos and Niki Goulandris accepted the Delphi Prize for Man
and His Environment on behalf of the Goulandris Natural History
Museum, in the Athens suburb of Kifisia.
   The Onassis Foundation was set up in 1975 by the estate of the
late Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle S. Onassis in memory of his
only son, who was killed in a plane crash two years earlier.

   A man chased an alleged drug dealer away
from his house, and hours later his home was destroyed by a fire
caused by two firebombs hurled through a window, authorities said
Wednesday.
   No one was in the one-story, frame house when it burned
Wednesday, said Lt. W.R. Bush of the city Fire Marshal's Office.
   Fire officials said the home owner told investigators he had
argued with a man he believed was trying to sell drugs in front of
his home and chased him away. The resident, whose name was note
released, said he had been having problems with drug dealers near
his home since he moved there a year ago.
   The alleged drug dealer threatened revenge, the home owner told
authorities. And a few hours later, Bush said, the man came back
and threw two gasoline-filled bottles with burning rags into the
house.
   Bush said witnesses corroborated the man's account and gave
investigators the name and address of a suspect, who Bush said
would be charged with arson.

   Parliament returned King Baudouin to
the throne Thursday, two days after he agreed to be suspended to
avoid signing a bill legalizing abortion. Lawmakers urged changes
in the law to reduce royal privileges.
   There were no votes against putting the king back on the throne,
but 93 of the 338 deputies present abstained.
   King Baudouin, a devout Catholic, refused to sign the abortion
bill after it was passed by Parliament last Friday. As the
constitutional head of state, he must sign all bills to make them
law.
   On Tuesday, Baudouin agreed to a temporary suspension. He was
removed from the throne Wednesday, after which the government
enacted the law itself.
   Prime Minister Wilfried Martens said his center-left government
will seek changes in the constitution to prevent future refusals by
the king, on moral grounds, to endorse legislation. He did not
elaborate.
   But it is expected the government wants the royal powers,
already largely ceremonial, reduced further.
   Experts said the king cannot cast aside his constitutional role
only because he morally opposes legislation. They said he can only
lose his constitutional powers if he is physically or mentally
unable to rule.
   The bill the king opposes ended a 123-year ban on abortions in
this overwhelmingly Catholic nation. It allows abortions if a
woman's doctor deems a patient is in ``a state of distress.''
Opponents say this in fact makes abortion available on demand.
   ``In short, the bill represents a serious diminution of respect
for the life of the weakest. You will therefore understand I do not
wish to be involved with that law,'' the monarch said in a letter
to Martens last week.
   ``To those who are surprised at my attitude, I put the following
question: Is it normal that I am the only Belgian citizen who must
act against his conscience in such important matters? Do all have
the freedom of conscience except the king?''
   The Belgian monarch has long opposed abortion. In his 1989
Christmas message, he spoke of the need for ``special protection
and care (for children) including the correct legal protection both
before and after birth.''
   Vatican Radio on Thursday praised King Baudouin for refusing to
sign the bill into law.
   In an introduction to a news report, the radio station said the
king made a ``noble and courageous choice'' that was dictated by
his ``very strong moral conscience and his undisputible sense of
statehood.''
   The Roman Catholic Church opposes abortion in all circumstances,
and Pope John Paul II has campaigned continuously against it. There
has been no comment from the pope on the king's move.

<HEAD>Senator D'Amato Plans to Test Soviet Blockade of Lithuania</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato said Thursday he will
test a Soviet blockade of Lithuania by trying to enter the
breakaway Baltic republic on a visa issued by the nation's
independent government.
   D'Amato, a New York Republican, said he has an invitation to
visit Friday from Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis. He
said he expects to be accompanied to the border, 185 miles from
Warsaw, by a high-level Lithuanian government delegation.
   D'Amato said he will try to cross the border with a Lithuanian
visa despite the fact that the Soviet Union does not recognize the
republic as an independent nation.
   The Soviet Union has ordered Western diplomats out of Lithuania,
evicted foreign journalists and forbidden traffic at the single
Polish-Lithuanian border crossing. It is Lithuania's only direct
land access to the rest of Europe.
   The steps were taken in an effort to force Lithuania to retract
its declaration of independence made March 11.
   The United States never recognized the forced incorporation of
Lithuania into the Soviet Union in 1940, but it also has not
recognized Lithuania as an independent state. It has urged
negotiations between Vilnius and Moscow.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater commented
on D'Amato's trip and said: ``We're always concerned about members
of Congress and others getting too involved in foreign policy.
   ``But on the other hand, he is a senator who has an important
message to deliver. He represents a broad constituency and has
every right to make that trip and deliver his message.''
   Congressmen, including D'Amato, have been urging President Bush
to give Lithuania more support. Some U.S. politicians have
suggested sanctions if force is used against the republic.
   ``We'll find out about glasnost,'' D'Amato said when asked what
he thought Soviet KGB border troops would do when he reached the
border.
   ``We'll find out if they are really for peace, or if this is a
case of saying one thing and doing another,'' he said.
   If blocked, he pledged ``to raise the question as to why they
would be turning back a United States senator who has come at the
invitation of the elected representatives of the people of
Lithuanian.''
   He criticized Western news organizations for withdrawing their
correspondents from Vilnius after being to ordered to do so by the
Soviets.
   D'Amato is the junior Republican on the Senate Intelligence
Committee and also serves on the Appropriations Subcomittee on
foreign operations.
   He is not considered one of the Senate's leading voices on
foreign relations.
   Before he left Wednesday, D'Amato tried to deflect suggestions
that the trip was designed to counteract problems at home.
D'Amato's public opinion ratings have slipped dramatically since
the Senate ethics committee began looking into allegations he used
his influence to steer federal Housing and Urban Development money
to friends and political supporters.
   ``Now, if every time I do something that's not associated with
HUD, you're going to say `Oh, you're doing that because it's not
associated with HUD,' that's silly,'' he told reporters Wednesday.

   A jury today rejected a delicatessen
owner's claims that he was promised a slice of actor Paul Newman's
gourmet food companies.
   The Superior Court jury deliberated just five hours over two
days before deciding that Newman never promised Westport deli owner
Julius Gold 8 percent stock in the companies, Newman's Own Inc. and
Salad King Inc., for the help Gold said he provided in launching
the businesses in 1982 and 1983.
   ``It's just tragic, all of this energy and time could not have
been spent in more charitable pursuits, but that's the nature of
the beast,'' Newman said moments after the verdict was announced.
   Newman showed no emotion as the decision of the six-member jury
was announced. He shook hands with his attorneys and his partner,
author A.E. Hotchner, before leaving the courtroom.
   Gold sat dejectedly without moving for 15 minutes after the
verdict was announced and appeared despondent over the verdict. But
he said he would not appeal.
   ``I'm disappointed,'' Gold said. ``I brought the case because I
thought I was wronged. I realized I was dealing with an uphill
battle, going against a celebrity of world status. Also, the
charitable thing was a hard thing to overcome.''
   Hotchner was elated by the verdict, calling it a vindication of
his friend and business partner.
   ``Newman's never stiffed anyone in his life,'' Hotchner said.
``If anything, he's overly generous to people.''
   Newman, who attended the highly publicized trial almost daily
since it started March 20, claimed that Gold's only participation
in getting the companies started was to sell some of the dressing
in his store.
   Newman and Hotchner started Newman's Own on a whim, beginning
with salad dressing that Newman originally made in the basement of
his Westport home. The product line was later expanded to include
spaghetti sauce, popcorn and lemonade.
   All profits _ $28 million to date _ have gone go to charity. The
Westport-based companies had a record $42 million in sales last
year, up from $36 million in 1988.
   An earlier trial ended in a mistrial in 1988 when the jury
mistakenly received depositions that had not been admitted as
evidence.

<TEXT>
   West Germany said Thursday it was
moving ahead with plans to replace the nearly worthless East German
currency with the mighty Western mark by summer, amid uproar over
the proposed exchange rate.
   Finance Minister Theo Waigel confirmed newspaper reports that
under the proposed currency union, East Germany would relinquish
control of monetary policy to the West German central bank,
Bundesbank.
   ``Naturally, sovereignty over monetary policy in this currency
union will lie completely with the Bundesbank,'' Waigel told
reporters.
   Waigel said government ministers were studying a 50-page draft
proposal for replacing the East German mark. He said West Germany
would like basic agreement on the contract by next month and
establishment of the common currency sometime this summer.
   Merging the German currencies is crucial to plans for rebuilding
East Germany's battered economy and to West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's hope for a speedy unification of the states.
   But East Germans are outraged by a Bundesbank recommendation
that they get one West German mark for every two East German marks.
According to the proposal, a 1-1 conversion rate would apply only
on limited amounts of savings.
   Thousands of people rallied in East German cities Thursday to
underscore demands for a 1-1 exchange rate. The East Germans say a
broad 2-to-1 rate could lead to impoverishment.
   How the German currency union will be worked out is also
worrying other European countries.
   A senior Dutch banker said this week that ``irresponsible''
promises by Kohl to East Germans about the terms of monetary union
have driven European interest rates to ``absurdly'' high levels.
   France, Italy and European Economic Community officials have
been pushing for quick creation of a common EEC currency and
central bank. A number of West European countries have expressed
concern the unification process might distract West Germans from
the EEC's stated goal of closer European integration.
   Waigel said Bonn hoped to offer a finished proposal to East
Germany by mid-April, but that depended on when a new East German
government was formed. Negotiations are under way in East Berlin on
forming a coalition government, following East Germany's first free
elections on March 18.
   ``We expect there will be negotiations (with East Germany) after
Easter, at the latest,'' Waigel said.
   Waigel said the Bundesbank's recommendation for a 2-to-1
conversion rate was not discussed by the government ministers
Thursday.
   The Bundesbank has said a general 1-to-1 swap for East German
marks could doom many East German industries and businesses, not
only by increasing the value of their debt, but by boosting the
purchasing power of East Germans who might then start buying
superior West German products.
   The West German government says it is examining the Bundesbank
proposal, but has not disclosed what it will offer East Germany.
   Handelsblatt, a widely respected West German financial
newspaper, said the government would choose a 1-to-1 rate for wages
and pensions and increase the amount of savings that can be
exchanged at that favorable rate.
   But even if wages and pensions are converted at 1-to-1,
corporate debt and other business-related aggregates will still be
exchanged at a 2-to-1 rate, the newspaper said.

   NASA finished testing the $1.5
billion Hubble Space Telescope aboard Discovery and started final
pre-countdown work Thursday, raising the space agency's hopes for a
timely launch next week.
   It is the most comfortable NASA officials have felt about
Tuesday's launch date since a power outage interrupted the testing
Monday, said George Diller, a spokesman for the space agency.
   ``Basically, the work's done. We're just down to the things you
can't do before now anyway,'' Diller said.
   ``We're essentially on or near schedule on all of that work. I'm
really not aware of anything that's unusually shaky,'' he said.
   The countdown is scheduled to begin Saturday afternoon. Early
forecasts show an 80 percent chance of weather favorable for launch
Tuesday, with the weather worsening slightly during the next two
days.
   Functional testing of the telescope and shuttle was completed
early Thursday, and the launch pad was cleared of all non-essential
personnel for final preparation of the payload and orbiter.
   Technicians were in the middle of the 52-hour test when a power
outage at Kennedy Space Center knocked out air conditioning and
forced the shutdown of heat-sensitive computers. Testing resumed
Tuesday evening and had to be completed by Thursday morning for the
mission to stay on schedule.
   As soon as the testing ended, technicians began the routine
procedure of placing explosive devices on the shuttle's solid
rocket boosters, external tank and the orbiter itself to be used in
the event of a serious malfunction, said NASA spokesman Bruce
Buckingham.
   Power was turned off to the telescope and shuttle so that the
hazardous work could be performed. Charging of the telescope's
nickel-hydrogen batteries also was halted and was to resume.
   The telescope's batteries will be charged until the shuttle's
payload bay doors are closed two days before launch.
   The 24,250-pound, 43-foot-long telescope, named for the late
American astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, is the most expensive unmanned
spacecraft ever built by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration. It originally was scheduled for launch in 1983, but
was delayed due to technical problems and the 1986 Challenger
explosion.
   Discovery's five astronauts plan to deploy the telescope on the
second day of the five-day mission.
   The Hubble will orbit 380 miles high for 15 years, enabling
astronomers to study stars and galaxies so distant that their light
has been traveling to Earth for 14 billion years. It will be
capable of detecting objects 50 times fainter and with 10 times
greater clarity than the best ground-based observatory.

<HEAD>Peres Promises to Pursue Peace Despite Coalition Composition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Labor Party leader Shimon Peres, criticized for
forming a coalition dependent on defectors from the right-wing
Likud bloc, reaffirmed Thursday that he will be able to pursue the
peace process if he is prime minister.
   Peres said that once installed, his government would ``without
question'' approve U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker's plan
for convening Palestinian-Israeli talks in Cairo.
   ``We say the government will be based on the peace policy of the
outgoing Cabinet,'' Peres said on Israel radio. ``But we will
permit the continuation of the process ... to renew the peace
process.''
   Leftists feared Peres could have trouble making bold moves since
his majority in parliament would be thin and dependent on
conservative religious factions and hawks who had crossed party
lines.
   Peres met in Tel Aviv with leaders of three left-wing parties
who were critical of his tactics in trying to form a new
government. They control 10 seats in the parliament, or Knesset,
and some threatened to withhold support vital to Peres.
   Amnon Rubinstein, leader of the Shinui (Change) faction which
has demanded sweeping election reform, said the notion of switching
back and forth between political blocs was ``a problem that goes to
the very core of Israeli democracy.''
   Peres told President Chaim Herzog on Wednesday he had succeeded
in piecing together a ruling coalition. But Labor leaders have
refused to divulge the names of the prospective defectors who have
promised support.
   Peres said secrecy was necessary to woo other supporters. He is
believed to have only 61 or 62 members of the 120-seat Knesset
pledged to support his leadership.
   The announcement came two weeks after he was assigned to replace
Likud Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   Shamir lost a no-confidence vote March 15 in a crisis triggered
by dispute over Baker's conditions for holding Palestinian-Israeli
talks. Peres forced the showdown with Shamir, who was reluctant to
accept Baker's proposals on forming a Palestinian delegation.
   Parliament officials were expected to set a voting date on the
proposed new government for either Sunday or Wednesday.
   If Peres succeeds, it would be the first time since 1977 that
the left-of-center Labor ruled without sharing power with Likud.
   According to Israeli media, the key defector is Likud legislator
Avraham Sharir, whom Shamir dumped as tourism minister after
criticism that Sharir spent too much time on junkets abroad and
padded government payrolls with cronies.
   Labor promised Sharir, 67, he would return to the tourism post
or be named transport minister in a Labor-led government.
   Sharir's Tel Aviv home was placed under special police
surveillance Thursday after his family received telephone threats,
Tel Aviv police spokeswoman Ahuva Ivri said.
   The liberal daily Haaretz newspaper said Labor has left open
other Cabinet jobs for potential defectors.
   It said two religious parties, the National Religious Party and
the Torah Guardians, were being offered the Education and Interior
portfolios respectively if they support Labor. The Finance Ministry
was held for Yitzhak Modai, head of a disgruntled Likud breakaway
group.
   Likud leaders mounted intensive efforts to court Modai and other
potential defectors, promising seats in the next parliament.
   Army radio said Modai's breakaway group was even offered a 2.5
million letter of credit signed by a wealthy party contributor as a
guarantee that the promise of future parliament seats would be
fulfilled.

<HEAD>Consumers Borrowed More in February Than They Repaid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Americans took out $3.4 billion more in
consumer credit than they retired in February, but the pace slowed
because of slackening demand for car loans, the government said
Thursday.
   The Federal Reserve said consumer credit increased at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.7 percent, down from January's
revised 6.4 percent pace. The January rate was reported last month
to have been 5.9 percent.
   Consumer credit, which includes all consumer loans except
mortgages, was up 7.3 percent in December.
   Automobile loans advanced in February to a seasonally adjusted
$889 million in February. That represented an annual rate of 3.7
percent, less than half the 8.4 percent jump in January when sales
incentives were reinstated. The incentives continued in February,
but consumer response failed to keep up.
   Without incentives, auto loans had fallen 0.4 percent in
December.
   Credit card debt rose $485 million, 2.9 percent at an annual
rate, slightly faster pace than January's 1.8 percent gain but much
slower than the 23.7 percent rate during the December holiday
shopping period.
   Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate were up
12.1 percent, an increase of $2.04 billion, after gains of 9
percent in January and 3 percent in December.
   Borrowing for mobile homes continued its recent downward trend,
off $2 million or 0.1 percent. With the exception of a 2.8 percent
gain in September, mobile home credit has fallen each month since
February 1989.
   The various changes left total consumer debt at the end of
February at $723.7 billion.

<HEAD>Study That Finds AZT Slows Onset of AIDS Is Published</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An often-cited study that shows the
experimental drug AZT can delay the onset of AIDS in people with
the HIV virus appeared in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine.
   ``Now, we have something to give people,'' said Dr. Anthony
Fauci, director of the Office of AIDS Research of the National
Institutes of Health. ``It's important for people who feel they
have been exposed to HIV to get tested to determine if they are
infected.''
   The study, whose preliminary findings were first released last
August, formed the basis of the federal Food and Drug
Administration's decision last month to allow physicians to
prescribe the drug for patients who are infected with the
human-immunodeficiency virus but have not developed symptoms of the
disease, researchers said. Although the study's conclusions were
known, the data had not been published until Thursday.
   Fauci on Wednesday discussed the clinical trials after
addressing the Johns Hopkins Conference on AIDS, a three-day
gathering of 650 scientists from across the country.
   ``This is a strong mandate for increased testing,'' said Dr.
John Bartlett, chief of AIDS service at the Johns Hopkins Hospital,
one of the 32 medical centers that participated in the study of
1,338 patients.
   Researchers hailed the results not only as good news for those
infected with the virus that causes AIDS, but also for those who
have placed themselves at risk of contracting the virus. With early
detection, people may stand a better chance of staving off the
disease, they said.
   Over a two-year span, fewer patients who were given AZT
progressed to the full-blown stage of the disease than patients
taking a placebo, the study found.
   Despite the encouraging results, researchers said patients must
be observed longer before it can be determined if the drug actually
lengthens the life of infected people.
   The study's lead author was Dr. Paul Volberding of the
University of California at San Francisco.
   In the study, the 1,338 subjects were divided into three groups
of nearly equal size. One group received a placebo, one received a
small dosage of AZT and the third received a higher dosage of AZT.
   AIDS developed in 33 patients taking the placebo, 11 taking the
smaller dosage and 14 taking the higher dosage, the researchers
reported.
   The drug is manufactured by the Burroughs Wellcome Co. of
Research Triangle, N.C. It was first sold in 1987, when the company
received FDA approval to market it for people with full-blown AIDS
and advanced cases of AIDS-related complex.

   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat asked Italian officials
on Thursday to help him persuade Israel to negotiate a settlement
with the Palestinians.
   Italian political leaders who met with Arafat said he described
1990 as a do-or-die year for the Arab-Israeli peace process.
   ``Arafat explained clearly that 1990 is either a year in which
the peace process truly opens, or else it can lead to a new
terrible spiral of war,'' said Giorgio Napolitano, an Italian
Communist Party official.
   Arafat said earlier in Paris that he would like to meet with
Shimon Peres, the Israeli Labor Party leader who is working on
forming a coalition government.
   Before leaving Paris for Rome on Thursday, Arafat told the
Europe One radio station he would meet with Peres at the French
presidential palace.
   ``The peace process is blocked because of problems in another
camp,'' said Arafat in the radio interview, referring to Israel.
But ``if Mr. Peres can assure himself a majority, at that moment
things could move.''
   Arafat said he also expects to hold more talks with former
President Jimmy Carter. They met twice in Paris, and Carter praised
what he said were the PLO leader's efforts to advance peace in the
Middle East.

<TEXT>
   Former U.S. District Judge Harry Claiborne, who
was convicted of tax evasion in 1984 and later impeached, has won a
legal battle to resume practicing law in federal court.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Broomfield of Phoenix said Wednesday
he was adopting a Nevada state bar disciplinary board's
recommendation that Claiborne be reinstated.
   Claiborne, 73, was convicted of failing to report more than
$106,000 on his 1979 and 1980 tax returns. He was removed from his
lifetime post Oct. 10, 1986, after the U.S. Senate convicted him on
three of four articles of impeachment.
   Claiborne claimed at his impeachment hearing that he was the
victim of prosecutors he had offended while on the bench.
   He served 17 months of a two-year prison term and resumed his
law practice in state court shortly after he was released.
   Broomfield had denied Claiborne permission to practice in
federal court in September 1988, but allowed him to apply again
last September.
   ``I am very happy about it,'' Claiborne said Wednesday. ``I
certainly intend to go back to practicing in federal court but I
don't have anything lined up yet because I had to be careful not to
encourage people to wait around for me.''
   The disciplinary board said Claiborne ``has built up a reservoir
of good deeds; and for whatever transgressions he may have
committed in the past, Harry Claiborne has by any standard paid the
price.''

<HEAD>Groups Urges States to Abandon Crusades for Mandatory Record
Labels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two national groups pressing for voluntary
warning labels on records urged state legislators Thursday to drop
crusades for mandatory labels in light of an industry effort to
alert consumers to explicit lyrics.
   Tipper Gore, president of the Parents' Music Resource Center,
said lawmakers in 13 states had promised to abandon their efforts
to require labels on music with graphic lyrics about sex and
violence.
   Bills are pending in six states, she said.
   The center ``has never believed that legislation is the answer.
Today, we are asking state lawmakers to give the voluntary system a
chance to work,'' Gore said.
   Six major record companies said last week they plan to create a
uniform voluntary labeling system to identify explicit recordings.
   Gore and Ann Lynch, president of the National PTA, said that
would strengthen a labeling agreement their groups had reached with
the industry in 1985. Companies were not complying with that
agreement in many cases.
   ``The key difference is the uniform standard they are going to
use,'' Gore said.
   Asked if a standard alone will result in a wider use of the
labels, she replied:
   ``We take the industry on good faith that they really do mean to
seriously address the problem. We take them at their word and we
believe they will do the job correctly this time.''
   At least one state legislator said he would reintroduce his bill
next year if the record industry doesn't improve.
   ``We hope for a positive outcome,'' said Tom Susman, a member of
the West Virginia House of Delegates. ``If not ... then it will be
up to the legislators to look at this issue again.''
   States where lawmakers have promised not to pursue or revive
mandatory labeling bills include Arizona, Iowa, Maryland, Oklahoma,
West Virginia, Tennessee, Alaska, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, New
Mexico, New York and Rhode Island, Gore's group said.
   Similar bills are pending in New York and Rhode Island, as well
as Missouri, Florida, Delaware and Pennsylvania, according to the
National Association of Recording Merchandisers.
   Gore's group and others have expressed concern about music that
they believe encourages violence, suicide, drug use, sexual
promiscuity, bigotry and devil worship.
   Susman said the record labeling system would be comparable to
the guidance parents receive from film ratings.
   Gore said her group has never favored censorship and denied that
it inspired state legislators to propose mandatory labeling. She
gave parents and teachers credit for spurring the latest industry
plan.
   However, record merchandising industry executives last week
indicated that pressure from state legislatures was at least partly
responsible for their decision to standardize and try to broaden
the labeling system. The music industry has been lobbying hard in
state capitols to kill the bills.
   Companies creating the new system are Warner Brothers, MCA, CBS,
Capitol-EMI, RCA and Polygram.
   Representatives of the Recording Industry Association of America
were scheduled to meet with state legislators Friday in Washington
to discuss the size, content and placement of the new stickers.
   The association represents companies that produce more than 90
percent of the records sold in the United States.

<TEXT>
   The Senate unanimously approved legislation
Thursday reauthorizing a special program of federal grants to help
states and localities provide vocational education programs.
   By a 96-0 vote, senators authorized spending roughly $7 billion
through fiscal 1994 for the grants.
   ``I believe this bill is an excellent piece of educational
policy,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the
Labor and Human Resources Committee.
   Under revisions to the existing federal grant program, funds
will be more precisely targeted to the neediest groups, including
non-English speaking young people.
   Kennedy said he was pleased that the bill, a version of which
already has been approved by the House, ``greatly strengthens
provisions to ensure that the handicapped, disadvantaged and those
with limited English proficiency are adequately served.''

   One in three American adults say they or
someone in their family have sought help from a psychiatrist or a
psychologist, according to a survey released Thursday.
   Yet, the survey also found among those polled widespread
opposition to putting any kind of mental health facility or housing
for people with mental illness in their neighborhoods.
   Miles Shore, director of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's
program on chronic mental illness, said he was encouraged that
nearly 90 percent describe mental illness as a serious health
problem, and many believe it can be treated.
   But he said the survey points out a contradiction in what he
called the ``not-in-my-back-yard,'' or NIMBY, phenomenon.
   ``On the one hand, people do object to siting these facilities
in their `back yard.' On the other hand, over half recognize that
mental illness can improve and that keeping up a normal life _
which includes community living _ will help with that
improvement,'' he said.
   The survey found that 74 percent of those polled believe
correctly that anyone can become mentally ill and that mental
illness can be cured, and 53 percent believe that keeping up a
normal life in the community will help a person with mental illness
get better.
   But two in three believe there is a lot of stigma attached to
mental illness, according to the survey, which was commissioned by
the foundation.
   It also found that those with higher incomes were more likely to
oppose placing mental health facilities in their neighborhoods.
   Members of families with income of more than $50,000 were twice
as likely to oppose these facilities in their neighborhoods, and
the strongest opponents tended to be older, well educated,
professional men who were married and owned a home in a large city
or a suburb of a large city, Shore said.
   The foundation's program on chronic mental illness commissioned
the study to help in its efforts to encourage acceptance of housing
for people with mental illnesses.
   The study was based on telephone interviews with 1,300 adults
between Dec. 1 and Dec. 11, 1989.
   It was funded by the foundation, the American Psychiatric
Association, the National Institute for Mental Health and the PEW
Charitable Trusts.

   One American does 20 to 100 times more damage
to the planet than one person in the Third World, and one rich
American causes 1,000 times more destruction, a population expert
said Thursday.
   ``The most serious population problem in the world is right here
in the United States,'' said Paul Ehrlich, Stanford University
professor of population studies.
   ``The most common misperception of the population problem is
that it's a problem of poor Indians who don't know how to use
condoms,'' he said. ``Actually, the problem in the world is that
there are too many rich people.''
   Ehrlich and other environmentalists spoke to about 1,200
students, teachers, garden-club members and corporate executives at
a conference on solving global environmental problems.
   He said the current world population of 5.3 billion is 1.8
billion more than in 1968 when he first prophesied the problems of
overpopulation in his book ``The Population Bomb.''
   He and his wife, Anne Howland Ehrlich, who co-wrote the current
book, ``The Population Explosion,'' say this decade will be the
turning point for global environmental problems.
   ``If we don't see some real action in this decade, it will
probably be too late to avert some very serious problems''
including inadequate food production, global warming, species
extinction and deforestation, said Mrs. Ehrlich, associate director
for the Center for Conservation Biology at Stanford.
   Ehrlich railed against highly developed nations like the United
States that he claims consume too much of the world's resources.
   ``The birth of a baby in the United States is something on the
order of 20 to 100 times more disastrous for the life support
systems of the planet as the birth of a baby in poor countries like
Bangladesh or Venezuela,'' he said.
   Most developing countries fall within the range, with Bangladesh
among the poorest and Venezuela among the richest Third World
countries, Mrs. Ehrlich said.
   She said she and her husband based the figures on 1987
statistics compiled by the United Nations on per capita commerical
energy consumption, an index used by environmentalists to measure
damage to the Earth.
   ``If it's a (rich) baby, it could be a thousand times more,''
Erlich said. ``Actually, the problem in the world is that there is
much too many rich people. ... It's not how many people you have
but how those people behave.''
   People who drive gas-guzzling luxury cars, air-condition their
homes and live from what Ehrlich calls
``high-intensity-the-hell-with-tomorrow agriculture'' do far more
environmental damage than subsistence farmers, he said.
   But he was not promoting the idea that Americans should adopt a
peasant lifestyle.
   In highly affluent Sweden, the average person uses about 60
percent as much energy as consumed by the average American, Ehrlich
said.
   ``We are super consumers and very unselective, and we're
extraordinarily incompetent and sloppy with our technologies,'' he
said.
   Several environmentalists at the conference echoed Ehrlich's
assessments on overpopulation and his claim the world is running
out of time to find solutions.
   ``You cannot address the problems soon enough,'' said George
Woodwell, president of the Woods Hole Research Center in Woods
Hole, Mass.
   ``We are driving the Earth into impoverishment. We are living on
its capital,'' he said. ``We're eating up the standing stocks of
trees and nutrients and soil in the process of feeding the current
5.3 billion people on Earth. In doing that, we make the Earth less
capable of supporting people in the future.''
   In terms of global warming, the United States, with about 5
percent of the world's population, produces 25 percent of the
world's output of carbon dioxide, believed to contribute to the
greenhouse effect, said Peter Raven, director of the Missouri
Botanical Garden and professor of botany at Washington University
in St. Louis.
   ``Chicago puts out as much carbon dioxide as China,'' he said.
``It's a peculiar world. The people at the top are consuming far,
far more than a vast number of people at the bottom.''
   The environmentalists suggested couples have no more than two
children, buy efficient appliances and cars and organize
politically.
   ``The bright side is we know societies can change very rapidly
when the time is right,'' Ehrlich said.
   Woodwell said President Bush could lead the nation in that
effort.
   ``We can only hope one Bush will experience a rapid greening
this spring,'' he said.

   Ten protesters on horseback charged a
column of state troopers Thursday as state officials tried to
inspect the proposed site of a dump for low-level radioactive
wastes.
   Police wrestled two riders off their horses as troopers advanced
on foot on the dumpsite.
   One rider appeared to have been knocked unconscious briefly, but
was revived and led away under arrest. No troopers were reported
injured.
   By mid-afternoon Thursday, 37 protesters had been arrested,
according to the Allegany County Sheriff's Department. Most were
charged with disorderly conduct and released after being issued
court appearance tickets.
   Six elderly protesters were arrested after they handcuffed
themselves to a chain stretched across a one-lane bridge leading to
the dump site in Caneadea, which is about 65 miles southeast of
Buffalo.
   ``I remember Allegany County when it was so clean and so
beautiful,'' said one of the protesters, Ermena Barber, of
Friendship. ``We've got to go back to those days even if we've got
to give up a lot of things to do it.''
   About 30 state police officers were trying to escort three
officials from the state Low-Level Radioactive Waste Siting
Commission past harrows, plows, hay wagons, and other farm
equipment blocking the road to the dumpsite.
   ``It's a long walk for nothing, but I'm not going to have a riot
for a walk over some land,'' state police Lt. Charles McCole told
his officers.
   It was the commission's fourth attempt since December to inspect
potential dump sites in Allegany County. It was the first attempt
at an inspection since state Judge Jerome Gorski issued a
restraining order forbidding protesters from blocking the
commission.
   Federal law requires states to have a place to store low-level
radioactive waste by 1993.

<HEAD>New Minimum Wage Won't Adversely Affect Food Stamp Recipients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Low-income families that receive food stamps
will keep most of those benefits despite an increase in the minimum
wage, a senior Agriculture Department official said Thursday.
   ``Every case is different, but most food stamp recipients will
keep at least 64 cents in benefits for each dollar they gain in
wages,'' said Assistant Secretary Catherine Bertini, who oversees
USDA food and consumer services.
   ``The food stamp program is not an alternative to work,'' she
said in a statement. ``We want to encourage people to work, earn
money and support themselves and their families.''
   The federal hourly minimum wage rose to from $3.35 an hour April
1 and will increase again next April 1 to $4.25 an hour.
   Food stamp benefits are allocated on the basis of several
factors, including household size and net income as determined by
deducting expenses for such items as housing, utilities and day
care.
   Bertini cited an example of a family of three claiming the
maximum deduction for housing, earning $580 per month in wages and
receiving $207 in food stamps. Under the new minimum wage law, the
family's earnings would increase by $78 to $658 per month, while
food stamp benefits would be reduced by $19 per month.
   That would total $787 per month under the old minimum wage and
$846 under the new, a net gain of $67 per month, she said.
   ``The gain in wages more than makes up for the loss in food
stamps,'' Bertini said. ``In fact, for each new dollar earned with
the new minimum wage, this household would keep 76 cents in food
stamp benefits.''
   More than 19 million people get benefits under the food stamp
program, which is estimated to cost $14.8 billion this year.

   The prime minister resigned Thursday
following six weeks of pro-democracy demonstrations across the
Himalayan kingdom, highly placed sources said.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a formal
announcement of the resignation of Prime Minister Marich Man Singh
Shrestha would be made soon by King Birendra. They said Shrestha,
prime minister since 1986, submitted his resignation Thursday night.
   At least 16 people have been killed in confrontations between
demonstrators and police since Feb. 18, when two banned political
groups _ the Nepali Congress Party and a coalition of left-wing
parties _ began agitating for a return to a multiparty democracy in
one of the oldest monarchies in the world.
   The first sign that there were differences in the government
over the handling of the pro-democracy movement came when
Shailendra Kumar Upadhyaya resigned Friday as foreign minister.
   Upadhyaya said he was resigning because he considered it
``immoral'' to stay in a cabinet headed by the prime minister.
   Upadhyaya said he had advised Shrestha to hold talks with the
agitators, ``but he did not listen to me. My advice to him went
unheeded.''
   On Sunday, King Birendra shuffled Shrestha's cabinet, dropping
nine ministers. Although no reasons were given for the reshuffle,
well-placed observers said it was to remove dissent within the
government.
   The government has not shown any signs of holding talks with the
agitators despite the momentum the movement is gathering daily.
   At least 3,000 telecommunication workers defied a government ban
on strikes and walked off their jobs on Thursday. Employees at 13
other government and semi-government corporations also struck.
   This week, airline pilots, lawyers, doctors, teachers and
engineers have stopped working, expressing support for the
pro-democracy movement.
   The agitators are demanding an end to a 29-year-old royal decree
banning political parties.
   Power in Nepal is shared by the monarch and a partyless
Rashtriya Panchayat, or National Assembly. One-fifth of the
assembly's 140 members are nominated by the king and the rest are
elected, but members are not allowed to belong to any political
party or propagate political ideology.
   A two-year experiment with a Western-style democracy ended in
1961 when Birendra's father, King Mahendra, dismissed the
government of the Nepali Congress Party, accusing it of
mismanagement and corruption.

   A humpback whale was found tangled in
fishing nets off the Virginia coast Thursday morning, but the huge
mammal apparently either freed itself or drowned before officials
could rescue it.
   ``It may be that he broke free from the net. He appeared to
leave the area rapidly,'' said Mark Swingle, a curator at the
Virginia Marine Science Museum. The museum, along with the Virginia
Institute for Marine Science, organized the rescue operation.
   The whale was spotted in the Atlantic Ocean just off this resort
city, near Rudee Inlet, said museum Director C. Mac Rawls. The
whale slowly drifted south, dragging nets and anchors along with
it, Rawls said.
   Rescue boats lost sight of the whale shortly before noon.
   Rawls said a diver rescue was considered, but it could be
dangerous. ``Because this animal is so strong, it could knock the
diver into the nets and entangle him,'' he said.
   The whale apparently became entangled in shad nets, which are
strung up and down the shallow coastal waters of the area. Swingle
speculated the whale may have been in shallow water feeding on fish.
   The 35-foot-long whale was a young animal that probably weighed
around 30 tons, Swingle said.
   A humpback whale washed ashore last weekend several miles
farther south of where the entangled whale was seen Thursday.
Tissue from that whale has been sent to the National Marine
Fisheries Service for analysis. It also appeared to have been
entangled in a net.

   The Lithuanian Parliament late Thursday approved a
message to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Gorbachev
appealed to the Lithuanian government Saturday to renounce its
declaration of independence and the message was meant as a response.
   The following is the text of the letter transmitted by the
Lithuanian Supreme Council in Russian and translated by The
Associated Press:
   U.S.S.R.
   Moscow
   The Kremlin
   President of the U.S.S.R. M. Gorbachev
   Deeply esteemed President,
   Your appeals to the Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania
and the people of Lithuania were met with genuine attention and the
desire to understand your point of view.
   We realize that Lithuania's determination to rejoin the family
of independent states creates concerns for the Soviet Union and for
you personally, esteemed president. You correctly assess the
situation as complex, demanding well-based discussions and
acceptable decisions. We value highly your efforts aimed at the
peaceful solution of problems, however certain questions connected
with your position are not quite clear to us. Lithuania, as before,
is prepared for honest dialogue, but this should not be accompanied
by the willful actions of your Armed Forces. Therefore, we propose
to hold soon initial bilateral consultations with the goal of
clarifying the positions of both sides on the questions that
interest them.
   You know that the problem of Lithuania has not been created by
Lithuania. Lithuania is only realizing its basic right.
   The Supreme Council of Lithuania is prepared to discuss through
dialogue the essence and letter of the acts and resolutions taken
by the Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania from the point
of view of international law and the U.S.S.R. Constitution as well.
   You also know that Lithuania proposes and intends to maintain
the existing economic, cultural and humanitarian ties with the
U.S.S.R.
   We believe that you, esteemed President, will prefer a political
solution of the problem to all others. In view of this, the Supreme
Council of the Republic of Lithuania once again affirms its
readiness to enter a dialogue and discuss measures of establishing
new relations between our states.
   The Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania
   On behalf of Chairman V. Landsbergis

   The military in the nominally
independent homeland of Venda overthrew the government Thursday and
said the area should be reincorperated into South Africa, radio
reports said.
   Col. Gabriel Ramushwana, 48, deputy chief of the Venda Defense
Force, announced the coup in a broadcast over Radio Thohoyandou. He
said the government of President Frank Ravele had been corrupt and
unstable, and the country had been plagued by lawlessness, boycotts
and human rights violations.
   The independent South African Press Association confirmed the
report and said there was singing and dancing in the streets of
Venda as news of the coup spread.
   The government-run South African Broadcasting Corp. said Ravele
and his Cabinet resigned. It said nothing about a coup.
   Ravele's government was the target of mass protests in recent
weeks that shut down schools, transportation and government
services.
   The protesters demanded that the 2,500-square-mile republic be
reincorporated into South Africa. This would allow Venda residents
to receive the benefits that go with South African citizenship.
They also demanded an investigation into allegations some Cabinet
members participated in ritual murder and witchcraft.
   Several of the demonstrations were dispersed by police gunfire
and there were reports of casualties, although the exact number is
uncertain.
   Ramushwana made no mention of Ravele's fate. He told everyone to
go home and return to work on Monday. Friday is a national holiday
in Venda and the rest of South Africa.
   The coup occurred Thursday morning, said a Venda businessman who
spoke on condition of anonymity. By noon, telephone connections had
been cut and roadblocks were set up on all routes out of the
homeland.
   There were no immediate reports of fighting or casualties.
   There are four nominally independent homelands in South Africa,
and three have experience military coups in the last 2{ years.
   An attempt at a coup in Bophuthatswana failed in February 1988
after the president, Lucas Mangope, was rescued by South African
police.
   Residents of the tribal homelands are denied South African
citizenship and the residential, pension and work rights that
accompany the citizenship. The homelands are not recognized as
independent by any other nations.
   South Africa also has six tribal homelands that have refused to
accept independence.
   Ravele was not among the homeland leaders expected at talks
Thursday in Cape Town with South African President F.W. de Klerk.
Only the non-independent homelands were to have been represented.
   Venda is in the far northeast corner of South Africa, adjoining
Kruger National Park, with a small strip of South African territory
separating it from the Zimbabwe border.

   Israelis are increasingly demanding electoral
reforms as cases of politicians offering favors for support to form
a coalition government become more blatant.
   ``There is a complete breakdown in trust,'' said law professor
Uriel Reichman, who is leading the reform campaign. ``Politicians
are using their power to enhance their own political ambitions by
bribing parties and legislators.''
   Examples abound.
   _Hours before he left the Finance Ministry last month, Labor
Party leader Shimon Peres gave $3.5 million to religious
institutions belonging to an ultra-Orthodox faction he hoped would
support his bid to become prime minister.
   _The rival Likud offered a $2.5 million guarantee to ensure its
promise of a new Cabinet post to Economics Minister Yitzhak Modai,
who had threatened to defect to Labor. The money did not reach the
$10 million Modai demanded.
   _Both Labor and Likud, archrivals in the race to form a
government, adopted a last-minute budget amendment March 30 giving
$110 million to religious institutions, triple last year's
allocations.
   Israelis are used to a certain amount of dealmaking in coalition
negotiations, as Israel's political system often makes small
parties the kingmakers between the two major parties.
   But the desperate steps taken by both the left-leaning Labor and
the right-wing Likud have brought an unprecedented call for reform.
   Newspaper editorials, student groups, women's groups and even
some politicians have urged a change in the system.
   The most dramatic appeal has come from two army reserve officers
who began a hunger strike Thursday in a park opposite Parliament.
The same day, Peres announced he had succeeded in piecing together
a ruling coalition to replace the one that collapsed over
disagreement on Middle East peace moves.
   The strikers have since been joined by eight others in their
fast. They met with thousands of well-wishers and collected 25,000
signatures calling for electoral reform.
   Ohad Limor, a lieutenant in the army reserves, said he joined
the hunger strikers after parliament approved the extra funds for
the religious parties.
   ``When I heard this, I said `That's it, no more.' This is not
something you see on television. This is my life,'' said Limor, 25,
sitting on a beach chair outside a tent.
   Most of those opposed to the current political system have only
vague notions about what should replace it. ``But there is nothing
that could be worse than what we have now,'' Limor said.
   Reichman, who says he has support from 68 Israeli mayors, made
three demands _ direct election of the prime minister, direct
election of at least half the legislators and adoption of a bill of
rights.
   The current system has Israelis voting for parties, not
individual candidates. Any party capturing 1 percent of the total
vote in the country wins a seat in the 120-member Knesset.
   Reichman's Public Committee for a Constitution for Israel and
other protest groups called a rally in Tel Aviv for Saturday, and a
wide range of organizations have urged members to attend.
   Likud, facing the possibility of a Labor-led government, jumped
on the bandwagon Thursday. It offered to set up a transition
government with Labor to legislate reform, including the direct
election of the prime minister.
   The reformers' chances for success are up against a long history
of broken promises from legislators who benefit from the existing,
unbalanced system.
   But Reichman and others were optimistic that the tide could not
be turned back. ``This is a critical moment in the history of the
country. There is hope that from the present chaos a new chapter in
our history will be written.''

   A tearful but defiant Leona Helmsley vowed
Thursday, ``I am not going to jail,'' after her attorneys asked a
judge to dismiss state income tax evasion charges against her.
   The 69-year-old self-proclaimed hotel queen was convicted last
year of federal income tax fraud and sentenced to four years in
prison, but is free on bond pending appeal.
   She still faces state charges that she, her husband and two
former employees falsified $3 million worth of business and tax
records from 1982 to 1986.
   Mrs. Helmsley sat quietly through the proceedings in Manhattan's
state Supreme Court. But surrounded by reporters as she left the
courthouse, she again protested her innocence.
   ``Enough is enough,'' she said in a hoarse voice, occasionally
choked by tears. ``I am not going to jail. I've done nothing wrong.
... My only crime is that I'm Leona Helmsley. For that I'm guilty.''
   Her attorney, Sandor Frankel, told Justice John A.K. Bradley
that his client has already been ``enormously punished'' by the
federal prosecution.
   He also argued that the state charges constituted double
jeopardy. The federal indictment contained at least 10 charges
specifically dealing with state income taxes, he said.
   ``The government should not be able to take multiple bites out
of the human hide,'' he said.
   Assistant Attorney General Alfredo Mendez said that the
188-count state indictment contained many other charges not
prosecuted by federal authorities.
   ``It is in fact in the interest of justice that New York tax
cheats be brought to justice,'' he said.
   The judge asked Frankel, ``If I dismiss the indictment, would
not the public conclude that there's one law for the rich and
another for the poor?''
   ``The fact that we're here, judge,'' Frankel replied, ``isn't
that saying there is one law for the wealthy, well-known and
vilified and another for everyone else?''
   Frankel also asked Bradley to allow a pretrial hearing to
establish whether the indictment originated through a ``tainted
chain'' from testimony Mrs. Helmsley gave under a grant of immunity
in a separate 1985 investigation of sales tax fraud.
   Her attorneys maintain that leaks to the media a year later
about her testimony prompted Mrs. Helmsley's enemies to contact
reporters about other activities, which led to the state and
federal investigations.
   Bradley said he would rule on the motions on May 17.
   Mrs. Helmsley faces up to four years in state prison if
convicted.
   Her husband, Harry, 80, was found mentally incompetent to stand
trial in federal court and wants to have the state charges against
him dismissed on the same grounds. An April 30 court date was set
to address that issue.
   In December, Mrs. Helmsley rejected an offer to serve a prison
term concurrently with her federal sentence in exchange for
pleading guilty to evading $750,000 in state income taxes.
   The two former executives, Joseph V. Licari and Frank J. Turco,
have accepted similar deals.

<HEAD>Military Says 659 Killed in Insurgency in First Quarter of 1990</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 659 people were killed in
the first three months of 1990 in violence resulting from the
nation's Communist insurgency, the military chief said Thursday.
   Armed forces chief Gen. Renato de Villa said that from January
to March, 365 Communist rebels, 179 soldiers and 115 civilians were
killed in ambushes or clashes.
   In the latest incident, rebels shot to death an army captain and
wounded his wife in a Manila suburb Thursday, officials said.
   They identified the officer as Capt. Leodegario Regis and said
he was commanding officer of the Capital Command's long range unit,
an elite weapons and tactics team.
   Military authorities blamed Communist assassins for the killing
of about 30 soldiers and officials in the capital this year.
   On Wednesday, Communist rebels ambushed and killed nine troops
on Mindanao island, 640 miles southeast of Manila, an army report
said Thursday.
   One guerrilla was also killed in the attack, and three rebels
and two government soldiers were wounded, the report said.
   The rebels, who have been fighting for 21 years to establish a
Communist state, have threatened to intensify operations in urban
centers, including Manila.
   In another development, the military said Thursday that a
lieutenant colonel sentenced to 12 years in prison for trying to
topple President Corazon Aquino had escaped.
   Air Force officials said imprisoned Lt. Col. Rodolfo Calzado
never returned after he was permitted a temporary leave from a
Manila stockade Feb. 25.
   Officials did not say why he was allowed to leave.
   Capt. William Cacacho, an air force spokesman, said Calzado was
convicted for his role in a January 1987 coup attempt.
   Cacacho said the report of the escape was withheld until
Thursday so as not to jeopardize the search.
   The coup attempt in January 1987 was the third bid to topple
Mrs. Aquino, who took power in 1986. The latest and bloodiest
attempt was in December.

   Prosecutors urged jurors Thursday not to let
sympathy or ``psychobabble'' prevent them from finding a college
student guilty of first-degree murder in the drowning of her
newborn in a dormitory toilet.
   Claire Moritt showed no expression as the state used its
summation to attack the defense argument that she was legally
insane, out of touch with reality and had no memory of being
pregnant or even giving birth.
   ``To allow your sympathy, your anger, psychobabble theories to
enter into your deliberations increases the chances of turning in
an unjust verdict,'' said Assistant State Attorney Stephen
Crawford. ``Just apply your common sense _ apply the obvious
facts.''
   Meanwhile, Circuit Judge Richard Lazzara dismissed a juror after
a customer in a downtown lunchroom overheard her telling her
sister-in-law about the case. He then sequestered the jury until a
verdict is reached.
   The case was heard by 16 jurors and will be decided by 12
members. The jurors had not been told which of them were alternates.
   In his closing arguments, Crawford recounted in detail the
morning of Oct. 23, 1989, to prove the 18-year-old Hillsborough
Community College student from Hollywood gave birth in her dorm
room and made a conscious decision to kill her baby son.
   Using a chalkboard, diagrams and a photograph of the dead
6-pound, 9-ounce infant, Crawford told how a roommate awoke to the
sounds of a baby crying.
   When roommates finally entered the bathroom, they found Ms.
Moritt kneeling and the baby stuffed in the toilet headfirst,
wrapped in bloody towels and sheets.
   Defense attorney B. Anderson Mitcham tried during his final
arguments to discredit the prosecution's case one witness at a time.
   He noted discrepancies in the testimony of the roommates about
whether there were towels and sheets covering the baby. He said the
medical examiner ``blew'' the autopsy and questioned why the bloody
linen was never tested for blood type.
   ``Did the prosecutor prove his case beyond and to the exclusion
of a reasonable doubt? I think not,'' Mitcham said.
   If convicted of first-degree murder, Ms. Moritt would
automatically be sent to prison for life without possibility of
parole for 25 years because the prosecution did not seek the only
other penalty _ the electric chair.

   The United States and the Soviet Union have
seven short weeks to put together a summit package of nuclear
weapons cutbacks and to find common ground on German unification
and ways to awaken the sluggish Soviet economy.
   But as Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze plodded past the midpoint of this
week's heavy pre-summit agenda, the outlook for meeting the May 30
deadline with solid accomplishments was uncertain.
   In fact, the summit may turn out to be less of a ceremonial
signing event than a working session for President Bush and Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``It's going to be a working visit, no time for sightseeing,''
is the way Gennadi Gerasimov, the spokesman for the Soviet foreign
ministry, described Gorbachev's trip here.
   Whatever reasons Gorbachev had for advancing the summit _ it was
initially planned for the second half of June _ the effect is to
put additional pressure on negotiators grappling with three of the
most complicated arms control treaties in history.
   And officials on both sides suggested on Thursday chances of
finishing the accord to cut long-range nuclear missiles by the time
Gorbachev comes here to see Bush are virtually nil.
   The most optimistic projection is that Baker and Shevardnadze,
and negotiators meeting in Geneva, will be able to reach agreement
by May 30 on the key issues and leave the details to be mopped up
after the summit.
   ``Taking into account it's in seven weeks,'' Yuri Nazarkin, the
chief Soviet START negotiator, said, ``it's impractical, I think,
to expect it's going to be signed at the summit. But definitely,
all the major issues should be resolved, making the treaty ready
for signing'' later on.
   Similarly, a senior U.S. official said: ``It depends in some
part on what we're able to do here. The desire was to resolve all
the major issues by the summit meeting, and looking realistically
toward completing and signing a treaty later in the year.''
   That could mean a second Bush-Gorbachev summit by the end of
1990, but no Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty before then.
   There are knotty problems confronting the ministers and the
negotiators. Among them: how to limit cruise missiles aboard
planes, submarines and surface vessels, and how to verify the
cutbacks are being implemented.
   The outlook is somewhat better for Bush and Gorbachev to be able
to approve protocols for monitoring underground nuclear test
explosions.
   On the third arms control front, the two sides are in tentative
agreement to slash their chemical weapons stockpiles to 20 percent
of the current U.S. level. But Sergei B. Batsanov, a Soviet
negotiator, said there was no agreement yet on two big issues _ how
to dispose of weapons and when to end production.
   The White House had left setting a precise summit date to the
Soviets. Taking a flexible approach, Bush wanted Gorbachev to set
his own timetable,
   The Soviet leader has a date June 19 in Moscow to take up
creation of a Communist Party for the republic of Russia as well as
the big Soviet Communist Party Congress beginning July 2.
Evidently, he wanted more time between the two sessions than
holding a late June summit with Bush would allow.
   As a result, U.S. and Soviet officials will have to hurry their
consideration of the kind of economic assistance the Bush
administration might extend to the Soviet leader for his
perestroika program of restructuring the Soviet economy. That could
mean anything from technical advice to trade credits. Congress will
have to be sounded out, as well.
   Pushing up the summit also shortens the time for the Soviets to
find a peaceful solution to their problems with breakaway Lithuania
and to work out a formula on German unification. Tensions in either
area could cloud what Bush and Gorbachev hope will be another
milestone in improving superpower relations.

<HEAD>Group Again Threatens to Kill Swiss Hostage in Lebanon</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A group threatened Thursday for the
second time to kill a Swiss hostage in Lebanon unless two Lebanese
jailed in France and Switzerland were freed.
   The threat was phoned to a Western news agency in Nicosia by a
man who said he was speaking for the Action Group for the Release
of Hariri. Authenticity of the call could not be verified.
   The group was unknown until March 9 when they called the news
agency office and threatened to kill either Elio Erriquez, 23, or
Emmanuel Christen, 33, Swiss Red Cross workers who were kidnapped
Oct. 16 in the south Lebanon town of Sidon.
   The caller demanded the release of Mohamed Hariri, jailed for
life in Switzerland for air hijacking and murder, and Anis
Naccache, serving a life sentence in France for an attempt to
assassinate an Iranian emigre leader in Paris.
   They gave March 12 as a deadline.
   The same caller said Thursday, ``We did not execute one of the
Swiss hostages because of his past humanitarian work in Sidon.''
   This time, unless the Lebanese pair are released, he said, ``We
will execute the first hostage after the blessed month of Ramadan.''
   He referred to the Moslem holy month scheduled to end about
April 26, depending on the sighting of the new moon.
   ``Our demands are clear, which is the release of fighter
Mohammed Hariri and fighter Anis Naccache,'' the caller said. He
spoke Arabic with a south Lebanese accent.
   After the first call, the International Committee of the Red
Cross and the Swiss foreign ministry expressed doubts about the
authenticity of the threat.
   There are 18 Western hostages in Lebanon, including eight
Americans.
   Longest held of the hostages is Terry Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was taken five
years ago March 16.

   An abortion rights organization on Thursday began a national
campaign to register college students to vote against abortion foes.
   Hollywood actors handed out leaflets at Harvard Square in
Cambridge, Mass., and at Columbia University in New York. Nearly
100 students attended a political gathering at a city college in
Santa Monica, Calif., where they heard a call to activism.
   ``You are part of a generation that grew up without the fear
that a crisis pregnancy, an unwanted pregnancy, could threaten your
health in a back alley abortion,'' said Kate Michelman, executive
director of the National Abortion Rights Action League.
   The campaign planned events at about 40 colleges Thursday and
Friday.
   In Massachusetts, actors Judd Nelson, Howard Hesseman and
Elizabeth Pena stood outside a subway stop and handed out leaflets
to passersby urging them to register and vote pro-choice.
   Between 40 and 50 people were registered, said Joyce Cunha,
associate director of MassChoice, an affiliate of the national
group.
   The actors were emissaries from the Hollywood Policy Foundation
Center, the non-profit arm of the Hollywood Women's Political
Action Committee.
   Cunha said students were a key part of the pro-choice movement,
which she said had been too complacent before last year's U.S.
Supreme Court decision allowed states to restrict abortion rights.
   ``This is a right they've always had. I think that's part of why
we want to help them to educate their peers to understand that the
right is in jeopardy,'' she said.
   In New York, actress Martha Plimpton urged 1,000 students at
Columbia to vote against candidates who want to outlaw abortion.
``I had no idea until recently I had to fight for this right,'' she
said.
   At Santa Monica City College, Michelman said abortion was an
issue in all 50 states as well as U.S. territories, referring to a
restrictive law recently enacted in Guam. The governor of Idaho
last week rejected an abortion restriction law in that state.
   ``The political landscape has radically changed in this
country,'' she said. ``A woman's right to reproductive freedom has
been threatened.''
   Students and college staffers who attended the talk in an art
building lecture room indicated they had not realized the scope of
the issue.
   ``I think I'm ready to be involved,'' said Tina Feiger, a
college staff worker. ``But I think what we need are specifics,
what races to work on.''

   An agreement between Sudan and rebels has
allowed needed food to be delivered to starving people in the
country's famine-struck southern region, lawmakers and officials
said Thursday.
   James Cheek, the U.S. ambassador to Sudan, joined Reps. Frank
Wolf, R-Va., and Tony Hall, D-Ohio, in outlining the resumption of
Operation Lifeline Sudan.
   ``The resumption of Operation Lifeline Sudan will save hundreds
of thousands of lives, and I congratulate the Sudanese government,
the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement, the world donor
community and the non-governmental relief agencies who were able to
make this happen,'' Wolf said.
   Operation Lifeline recognizes the neutrality of humanitarian
relief and ensures that all transport flagged by the United States
will be allowed to more freely.

<HEAD>Justice Study Shows Most Felony Defendants Released While Awaiting
Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two-thirds of defendants charged with felonies
in 39 of the nation's largest counties were released from police
custody pending court action, the Justice Department said in a
study released Thursday.
   The sampling of 11,063 felony cases filed in February 1988
showed that 66 percent of the defendants were released on bail,
bond or their own recognizance while awaiting trial or ther
dispositions of their cases.
   The study showed that 31 percent were held in jail pending trial
because they were unable to post bail. Another 4 percent of the
defendants were ordered held without bail following their
arraignments.
   The statistics, gathered from local courts by the Justice
Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics, was intended to be a
sampling of the disposition of felony charges in 75 of the nation's
largest counties.
   The study tracked the felony cases from initial filing to
disposition in courts in 39 local jurisdictions, including the
District of Columbia.
   Of the defendants accused of violent offenses, 59 percent were
released on bail or their own recognizance. Sixty-one percent of
murder defendants were kept in custody, while 39 percent were
released on bail or personal recognizance. Twenty-six percent of
murder suspects were ordered held without bail, 35 percent could
not post enough money to obtain their release.
   Among accused rapists, 55 percent were released while 45 percent
were detained pending disposition of their cases. Fifty-two percent
of robbery defendants were released as were 66 percent of those
accused of assault.
   Seventy-two percent of defendants charged with sale or
possession of illegal drugs were released from custody while
awaiting trial, the study said.
   Bail is requested by prosecutors to guarantee that a defendant
will appear in court for subsequent proceedings and does not
necessarily reflect the seriousness of the charges against the
defendant.
   To determine if there is a risk of flight, judges traditionally
consider whether the defendant has strong ties to the community,
through relatives or friends.
   Some jurisdictions, such as the District of Columbia, have
preventive detention statutes that allow defendants charged with
serious crimes to be held without bail.
   The statistics gathered in the study indicate that defendants
previously convicted of violent offenses were less likely to be
released on bail than suspects who had records of other types of
offenses.
   Only 33 percent of defendants who already had been convicted of
violent felony crimes such as rape or murder were released on bail.
   By contrast, 62 percent of defendants with prior felony drug
convictions were released on bail.
   According to the study, 76 percent of those released on bail
appeared for all court proceedings while 24 percent missed a court
date.
   Of the defendants for whom bench warrants were issued, 16
percent were eventually returned to court and 8 percent were
fugitives after one year.
   Besides the District of Columbia, the data was collected from
cases in Maricopa County, Ariz., Los Angeles, Orange, Sacramento,
San Bernardino, San Diego and Santa Clara counties in California;
Broward, Dade, Duval, Hillsborough, Palm Beach, Pinellas counties
in Florida, Fulton County, Ga.; Honolulu, Hawaii; Cook County,
Ill.; Suffolk County., Mass.; Wayne County, Mich.; St. Louis, Mo.;
Essex County, N.J.; Bronx, Erie, Kings, Monroe, New York and Queens
counties in New York; Hamilton County, Ohio; Allegheny, Montgomery
counties in Pennsylvania and Philadelphia, Shelby County, Tenn.;
Harris and Tarrant counties in Texas and Dallas, Salt Lake, Utah,
Fairfax County, Va., King County, Wash., and Milwaukee, Wis.

   Two Republican senators accused President Bush
and congressional leaders Thursday of reacting too slowly to
changes in Eastern Europe and urged cuts in the U.S. nuclear
arsenal.
   Frustrated with the administration's fiscal 1991 defense budget
and with proposed adjustments circulating on Capitol Hill, Sens.
William Cohen of Maine and John McCain of Arizona recommended a
leaner framework, including cutbacks for the B-2 Stealth bomber and
land-based nuclear missiles.
   They propose keeping military spending basically stable over the
next five years compared to the administration's recommendation of
modest increases of 2 percent or less each year _ less than the
probable rate of inflation.
   Following the senators' plan would mean cutting about $50
billion from proposed military spending during the five years, said
Cohen and McCain, both members of the Senate Armed Services
Committee.
   The GOP senators' call for a comprehensive defense strategy and
further reductions in spending came on the heels of a series of
congressional attacks on Bush's military budget and increasing
opposition to the administration's favored strategic weapons.
   Asked on Thursday whether colleagues shared the two senators'
sentiments, regarding the defense budget, Cohen said there were
several Republicans and Democrats on the Armed Services panel ``who
have yet to identify themselves.''
   ``Is it a majority yet, I think not,'' Cohen said. ``A majority
in a month or two, perhaps.''
   McCain said at the senators' news conference, ``Unfortunately,
the administration and our leadership here in Congress has failed
to come up with a comprehensive plan.''
   He and Cohen discounted Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's position
that this is a transitional year and the Bush administration should
wait before making major cuts in the Pentagon budget.
   ``By waiting another year ... we run the risk of having numbers
plucked out of the air arbitrarily and then being forced to cut and
paste our defense structure to meet budget numbers,'' Cohen said.
   Asked about the pace of Pentagon recommendations for change,
McCain said, ``Bureaucracies respond with incredible glacial-like
speed.''
   Cheney, when told of the Cohen-McCain proposal Thursday,
defended his own as ``a responsible plan that does in fact respond
to the developments we've seen in the world in the last six
months.''
   He also said that while no decision has been made to submit a
revised Pentagon budget for 1991, the results of major aircraft
reviews may lead to piecemeal proposals to further reduce 1991
spending.
   ``There may be some decisions ... that you'll want to feed into
the '91 budget process.'' He said the department would make
decisions ``within the next few weeks.''
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
complained recently that the Bush budget had several major blanks
that Congress would fill if the administration didn't.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, has criticized the Pentagon spending plan for its
``disconnects,'' what he sees as its failure to account for the
rapid changes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
   And on Wednesday, a bipartisan group of senators renewed their
plea for canceling the B-2 bomber. They released a Congressional
Budget Office report concluding that stretching out the program
over a longer term would push the cost of each plane to more than
$1 billion.
   Under the Cohen-McCain plan, the program to build 132 of the
stealth aircraft at a total cost of more than $70 billion would be
curtailed. Cohen, however, said he favors canceling the plane.
   McCain, a proponent of the B-2 last year, said he favors
limiting production but indicated he could go either way on killing
the program.
   Both senators acknowledged that the radar-evading plane is in
serious trouble in Congress.
   ``It was in trouble long before our statements,'' McCain said.
   Later in the day, Nunn said the B-2 bomber faces considerable
opposition and either the per unit cost or the total number of B-2
bombers has to be cut for the program to fly.
   ``Any time you have a weapons system start showing up on
`Saturday Night Live' and in the cartoons, you know it's got
problems. The B-2 is in that category,'' said Nunn, a proponent of
the plane.
   McCain and Cohen also predicted that Congress will not support
two land-based, nuclear missiles _ the multiple-warhead,
rail-garrison MX and the road-mobile, single-warhead Midgetman.
   In their proposal, they called for negotiating with the Soviets
a trade for the MX while continuing development of the smaller
Midgetman missile.
   ``I feel we should look toward dramatic restructuring of our
strategic capability'' to a two-pronged system rather than three,
McCain said, ``composed of strategic aircraft capability and our
submarine Trident forces.''
   The senators also proposed a reduction in the overall number of
ships, deferral of the Navy's version of the Advanced Tactical
Fighter and a review of the Seawolf attack submarine program.
   Cheney said Wednesday that the Pentagon is taking a close look
at the plan to buy the Seawolf. The submarine program, according to
McCain, is in trouble in Congress.
   Cohen later added that a consensus is developing within the
Senate Armed Services Committee and possibly the House Armed
Services Committee to change the defense strategy.
   ``We have to reshape our forces whether we like it or not,'' he
said. ``The answer is this is the reality. We've got to make the
best of that reality.''

   Jurors in the Iran-Contra coverup trial of
former national security adviser John M. Poindexter provoked
courtroom laughter Thursday by asking for a dictionary.
   The jury failed to reach a verdict in its fourth day of
deliberations.
   U.S. District Judge Harold Greene summoned prosecutors and
defense lawyers to the federal courthouse to discuss how he should
handle the jury's request.
   Laughter broke out in the courtroom when the judge read the
jury's note, which said, ``We need a dictionary please.''
   Prosecutor Dan K. Webb told Greene he had no objection to giving
jurors a dictionary unless they wanted to look up a legal term
already defined in the judge's instructions.
   Turning to defense lawyer Richard Beckler, Greene asked:
   ``You have some Supreme Court cases on that?''
   Beckler said he opposed giving the panel a dictionary. But the
defense lawyer didn't object to Greene's proposal to send the jury
a note offering to provide a definition of a common word.
   The judge said he didn't want to send jurors a dictionary
because ``the next thing you know they will look up conspiracy and
they'll know more than we do.''
   After a 10-minute recess, during which Greene sent a note to the
jury, the judge took the bench.
   Struggling to suppress a laugh, he read the jury's reply to his
note:
   ``The definition we required before is no longer needed.''
   The jury's request interrupted an otherwise uneventful day of
deliberations. The jury has been sequestered since Tuesday after
two jurors reported receiving telephone calls from reporters.
   Poindexter, a retired Navy rear admiral who served as
then-President Reagan's top national security adviser from late
1985 until the unraveling of the Iran-Contra affair in November
1986, is charged with five felony counts.
   Poindexter, 53, is accused of conspiring with former aide Oliver
L. North and others to make false statements and destroy documents
to obstruct congressional inquiries in 1986 about both elements of
the Iran-Contra affair.
   He is also accused of obstructing Congress and making false
statements by assuring lawmakers that the National Security Council
staff was not covertly helping arm the Nicaraguan rebels when such
assistance had been banned by law.
   The indictment also charges that Poindexter lied to Congress on
Nov. 21, 1986, when he said he did not learn of U.S. involvement in
a 1985 shipment of Israeli Hawk missiles to Iran until two months
after it occurred.
   The panel of eight women and four men is considering three weeks
of testimony, including videotaped testimony from Reagan, and
reviewing nearly 100 exhibits.

   The Defense Department asked Congress Thursday
for new powers to reduce the officer corps, including authority to
demote some officers to enlisted status if they refuse a transfer
from active duty to the reserves.
   The department also proposed reducing its oversight of defense
contractors as a cost-saving measure and called on Congress to give
the Pentagon more leeway in managing its budget.
   The proposals were contained in a pair of reports to Congress
that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said were aimed at improving
Pentagon management, limiting wasteful spending and improving
relations between the department and Congress.
   Donald Atwood, the deputy defense secretary, said the department
needs wider authority to reduce the officer ranks in order to
maintain a balanced force as troops are demobilized. The force will
shrink by at least 90,000 people over the next two years, he said,
and more cuts are likely in the years beyond.
   He did not say how many officers might be cut.
   Atwood said the personnel proposals, which include incentives
for officers to voluntarily leave the service, seek to avoid
harming morale in the all-volunteer force.
   ``These are people who have decided to make the military their
career, and we need to have the flexibility to let them leave with
honor, with dignity and with some kind of a financial benefit,''
Atwood told a news conference.
   The department recently proposed to Congress that enlisted
personnel who are forced out of the service be given severance pay.
Currently only officers qualify for severance benefits.
   Atwood also said the Pentagon was seeking legislative authority
to reduce its monitoring of contractors' work. He said this would
make the defense acquisition process more like a commercial
business and thus more cost effective.
   He said current law forces the Pentagon to use more inspectors
and auditors of suppliers' work than is necessary to ensure the
work is performed properly.
   ``We almost have to assume there's a dishonest atmosphere out
there'' among contractors, he said. ``We believe that by reducing
the degree of inspections and audits that we put on these
contractors, we can save money and we feel we'll get better
products.''
   Cheney, speaking at the same news conference, said that while
the Pentagon could improve its own management system, Congress was
partly to blame for inefficiencies in the department.
   In a 41-page policy paper sent to Capitol Hill on Thursday,
Cheney decried the ``tyranny of the annual budget review'' by
Congress. He said the six major committees that deliberate on the
defense budget every year should dwell more on overall military
goals and less on the particulars of individual weapons programs.
   Cheney said the congressional budget writers give the Pentagon
sometimes contradictory instructions and require too much paperwork
to justify budget requests. He recommended that Congress
appropriate defense money for two-year periods instead of every
year.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, gave high marks to Cheney's proposal, saying ``this
overall thrust will be well received on Capitol Hill.''
   Nunn said he will join Sen. John Warner, R-Va., ranking GOP
member on the Armed Services panel, in presenting Cheney's package
as legislation in the Senate.
   ``I think Secretary Cheney is absolutely correct when he says
that what we've got to have is cooperation not confrontation
between the Department of Defense and Congress,'' Nunn told a news
conference.
   ``I also agree and have said things very similar to what he said
about Congress' role should be broad policy and not getting into
every detail.''
   Nunn said his committee has done its best on crafting a two-year
defense budget but he said ``until we get an overall budget by the
White House that gives us the second year of numbers other than
defense ... there is no hope of getting a two-year defense budget
authorized and appropriated.''
   Cheney reacted coolly to a proposal Thursday by Republican Sens.
William Cohen of Maine and John McCain of Arizona to cut spending
on the B-2 stealth bomber and land-based nuclear missiles as part
of additional reductions in the 1991 defense budget.
   ``The budget we've sent up there is the one we think is the
right one,'' he said, adding later that the department might
recommend further cuts later this year after the completion of
internal reviews of major aircraft programs, including the B-2.

<HEAD>IRS Returns Property of Redd Foxx</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Comedian Redd Foxx got a truckload of personal
property back from the Internal Revenue Service, but a gift watch
from Elvis Presley, other expensive jewelry and eight cars will be
auctioned to pay back taxes.
   The comedian, who made his mark as a junk man in the 1970s TV
series ``Sanford and Son,'' is facing both the ire of the IRS and a
bankruptcy court.
   Not long after Foxx said he had been ``whitelisted'' and
``whiteballed'' by racism in the the IRS, the agency countered with
allegations that he spent $373,000 of his $500,000 take from the
film ``Harlem Nights'' on ``wine, women, song and gambling.''
   Agents raided his home in November to seize his property, and
Foxx was left with only a bed.
   Estimates of his tax bill have ranged from $750,000 to $2.9
million.
   Foxx filed for bankruptcy in 1983, but his tax problems
continued to mount. Efforts to sell his personal property at
auction were halted in February when the question was raised
whether the bankruptcy court or the IRS had jurisdiction over the
property.
   Foxx said he was pleased with the return of the personal items
Wednesday, but declined further comment.
   ``Mr. Foxx has made a psychological break from those items and
is simply happy to have his personal property back,'' Foxx's
attorney, Marc Risman, said of the items to be auctioned.
   Risman said a repayment agreement had been worked out with the
IRS, which has been taking his weekly paycheck, estimated at
$20,000. The Las Vegas resident now performs at the Hacienda Hotel.
   Risman said Foxx would make installment payments on current and
past taxes and will get to keep enough money to cover his living
expenses.

<HEAD>Indiana Senator's Plan Gets Cool Reception In Northwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT SONNER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Indiana congressman called Thursday for the
creation of a National Ancient Forest Reserve System to protect old
forests in the Pacific Northwest, but lawmakers from the region
said they don't appreciate his help.
   ``The ancient forests of Washington, Oregon and California are
not less a part of our natural heritage than the Grand Canyon, the
Everglades or Yosemite,'' Rep. Jim Jontz, D-Ind., said. ``These
great forests of the Northwest are truly a national treasure.''
   Jontz was joined by the leaders of five environmental groups in
unveiling his proposal to identify significant areas of ``ancient
forests'' and designate reserve areas that would be ``managed and
protected to maintain the biological integrity of the ancient
forest ecosystem.''
   Jontz' proposal was endorsed by the National Audubon Society,
the Sierra Club, The Wilderness Society, the National Wildlife
Federation and the Ancient Forest Alliance.
   Logging and road-building activites would be prohibited within
the designated areas under the proposal.
   The congressman's involvement in the debate over the Northwest's
timber supply crisis has drawn criticism from politicians in the
region, who view him as an outsider with no sympathy toward the
economic impact on timber-based communities of his proposal.
   ``All I will say is that I know that Indianans are experts on
overcutting the forests because a couple of centuries ago they
completed the job in their own state so now they are bringing their
expertise to Oregon,'' Rep. Les AuCoin, D-Ore., said.
   Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., said he was not familiar with Jontz
or his proposal. ``I think I'll introduce a bill to break up all
the dams on his private rivers,'' the senator quipped.
   Jontz said he should not be viewed as an outsider.
   ``These are national forests. As national forests, all of us
have a stake in their future,'' he said.
   Under Jontz' bill, the secretaries of agriculture and interior
would have 45 days to produce maps targeting areas of ``ancient and
associated forests'' to be protected.
   In addition to housing trees as old as 250 to 1,000 years old,
the characteristics of ancient forests include a mixed canopy
conifer, certain numbers of live species of trees and a certain
density of snags and down logs, he said.
   Associated forests would be defined as forest and lands which
are not ancient forests but ``are still necessary to retain the
integrity of the ecosystem,'' he said.

<HEAD>Undercover Police End Sting Against Upscale Prostitution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal agents raided high-priced call girl
escort services around the country, culminating a two-year, $2.5
million money-laundering sting, authorities said Thursday.
   ``These are not street-level hookers. The average receipts were
for $800 to $1,000 an evening,'' said Maurice Dettmer, chief of
criminal investigations for the Internal Revenue Service.
   The raids on more than 40 escort services late Wednesday and
early Thursday culminated what investigators called the nation's
largest concerted attack on upscale prostitution.
   The probe targeted escort services that accept credit cards,
Dettmer said. Agents created phony businesses in Atlanta and in
Tampa to process and disguise more than 25,000 credit-card receipts
for escort services from 23 cities in 15 states, he said.
   The businesses, given the name Sunset Enterprises, often
disguised the credit-card charges for copying services or converted
the charges to cash or loans for escort services or massage
parlors, authorities said.
   The $2.5 million in charged payments represented only about
one-quarter of the $10 million to $12 million the escort services
took in in gross earnings, Dettmer said.
   Agents charged a 13 percent to 18 percent fee, said Tampa police
spokesman Steve Cole. Typically, a call girl would collect $500,
the escort service $300 and the agents $200, Cole said.
   Local authorities said the clients included politicians,
entertainers, athletes, business executives using company credit
cards, doctors, lawyers and clergymen, but they gave no details of
the clients.
   ``We expect a lot of bosses and wives will be looking through
receipts this evening to see if they say Sunset Enterprises, not to
mention nervous businessmen,'' Cole said.
   Federal and state agents armed with warrants searched the
escort-service companies for records of prostitution activities,
income and expenses, and names of customers and their credit card
charges, said U.S. Attorney Robert Genzman.
   ``Also sought was evidence relative to alleged money-laundering
activities by escort-service operators to conceal an estimated $10
million in gross earnings in alleged credit-card fraud,'' Genzman
said.
   Authorities recently made three arrests in California and one
each in Fort Lauderdale, Atlanta and Dallas during the
investigation. After the raids, more arrests were expected,
authorities said.
   They said federal money-laundering and tax-evasion charges could
be expected. State racketeering and organized crime charges also
could be filed.
   ``If there are substantial amounts of charges for escort
services on a corporate or business credit card that would be a
strong likelihood there's been false tax deductions and they may
hear from the IRS,'' said Dettmer.
   Agents used the telephone directory to find escort services that
accepted credit cards. ``The reason they take credit cards is
because businessmen traveling have company credit cards, companies
then deduct it as a business expense,'' Dettmer said.
   Most escort services would pay to disguise credit-card charges
as going to a copying service, said an agent who worked on the
operation in Savannah, Ga.
   The sting began in Tampa on a small scale and grew like a spider
web, Cole said. As word spread, agents in the storefront contacted
the IRS after they were bombarded with laundering requests from as
many as 100 companies.
   Agents then sent out letters soliticing business, Cole said. The
escort service would send charge slips to the Tampa office. Agents
would make up another slip in the name of Sunset Enterprises and
send it on to the bank.
   The bank would send the money to Sunset and the agents in turn
would pay the escort service with checks that looked like tax-free
loans.

   The FBI and other federal agencies
investigating bombings that killed a U.S. judge and a civil rights
lawyer are considering offering a $500,000 reward, a law
enforcement source said Thursday.
   The decision on a reward for information leading to the arrest
of a suspect has not been made pending coordination among the
various federal agencies involved in the case, said the source, who
spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   The Dec. 16 murder of Circuit Judge Robert S. Vance also being
investigated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and
U.S. postal inspectors. The U.S. Marshals Service, which is
responsible for protecting federal judges, may also contribute to a
reward fund, if one is established, said the source.
   Vance, a member of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, was killed
by an explosion when he opened a package sent to his home in
suburban Birmingham, Ala. Two days later, a similar bomb killed a
Savannah, Ga., city councilman and civil rights lawyer, Robert
Robinson.
   Package bombs that law enforcement officials say are similar to
the ones that killed Vance and Robinson were found and defused at
the offices of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta and the
Jacksonville, Fla., chapter of the NAACP.
   Officials had considered offering a reward several months ago,
but rejected the idea at the time because they did not want to give
the appearance that the investigation had reached an impasse.
   Investigators are also trying to find the source of a series of
anonymous letters, dating back to one sent last August, to news
organizations threatening violence against the 11th Circuit.

<HEAD>Bizarre Airport Siege Ends with Soldier's Escape After 3 Days</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A bizarre three-day siege at
Haiti's international airport ended Thursday when a soldier who
threatened to blow up an empty American Airlines jet jumped from
the plane and escaped into a field of grass outside the main air
terminal.
   Pvt. Gerald Pierre, 20, who commandeered the Airbus A300 in an
apparent attempt to desert the army, vanished into the darkness at
about 1 a.m., according to Radio Haiti Inter.
   Officials offered no explanation for how Pierre escaped police
and soldiers guarding the airport, leading to speculation the army
allowed him to flee to peacefully resolve the affair.
   ``The Army High Command conducted the operation. They haven't
given their report yet,'' said Alfred Mentor, the Information
Ministry director.
   The army had no immediate comment, and it was not known whether
a search for Pierre was underway.
   Haiti-Inter, whose reporter witnessed the escape, said Pierre
leaped from the plane in the early morning dark and raced across
the tarmac toward a field of high grass near the terminal.
   Soldiers and police were guarding the airport but had not
surrounded the 10-foot-high perimeter fence, and Pierre could have
fled over an unguarded portion of it.
   Officials reopened the airport Thursday. It was closed Wednesday
after Pierre reportedly fired a machine gun in the direction of a
Haiti Trans-Air flight shortly after it landed on a flight from
Miami.
   The U.S. Embassy said American Airlines would send investigators
to examine the jet before it left the airport.
   Pierre had allowed passengers and crew members to leave the New
York-bound Flight 658 on Monday shortly after seizing the jet. On
Tuesday, he threatened to blow up the plane unless he was flown to
United States, Radio Haiti-Inter said.
   Radio reports said Pierre, who also was an airport security
guard, was carrying grenades and the machine gun when he took
control of the U.S. plane.
   Pierre was trying to desert after being reprimanded by an
officer for alleged insubordination, the reports said. He had
served in the army two years.
   Radio Metropole said military authorities had offered Pierre
immunity from prosecution if he surrendered and resigned from the
army.

   Author A. Scott Berg will write a biography of
Charles A. Lindbergh, authorized by the pioneering aviator's widow,
the Putnam Berkley Group announced Thursday.
   ``Impressed by the thoroughness, objectivity and compassion of
his previous works, Anne Morrow Lindbergh has granted A. Scott Berg
complete access to the heretofore restricted Charles A. Lindbergh
collections at Yale University and the Missouri Historical
Society,'' said Mrs. Lindbergh's attorney, James W. Lloyd.
   The 83-year-old widow of the man who first flew solo from the
United States to France also granted Berg access to her personal
papers.
   The permission is valid until the year 2000. Access to the
Lindbergh collections by other researchers will be restricted while
Berg completes his biography, the publisher said.
   ``Charles Lindbergh has been idolized and demonized ... and the
truth remains to be revealed,'' said Berg. ``In the end, I feel a
great life story will emerge _ one whose values are not only timely
but also timeless.''
   G.P. Putnam's Sons will publish the Lindbergh book in hardcover
in the fall of 1997. A paperback edition will be issued by Berkley
Books the following year.
   Berg graduated from Princeton University in 1971 and spent the
next seven years expanding his senior thesis on Maxwell Perkins
into the biography, ``Max Perkins: Editor of Genius,'' which won
the American Book Award.
   His most recent book was the bestseller ``Goldwyn: A
Biography,'' published last year.

<HEAD>House Panel Says Korean Companies Sold Military Goods To
Unfriendly Nations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House Armed Services subcommittee on
Thursday accused South Korean companies of violating U.S. contracts
by selling military parts and weapons to unfriendly nations.
   Members of the investigations subcommittee made the charges as
they urged the Bush administration to negotiate a strict contract
with the Asian nation on a proposal to allow Korea to manufacture
parts for and assemble FA-18 jets.
   Lawmakers expressed concerns that South Korea might sell the
aircraft parts to Iran.
   ``They are selling to unfriendly countries for a lousy buck,''
Rep. Nicholas Mavroules, chairman of the subcommittee, said in a
statement. ``When you negotiate this contract, make sure you get a
tighter provision with tighter controls to prevent more
diversions.''
   The Massachusetts Democrat cited hearings last year in which it
was revealed that Korean companies had sold M-16 rifles
manufactured under a coproduction deal with the United States to
unfriendly countries despite a ban on such sales.
   The names of the nations are classified.
   Mavroules said Thursday that Korean companies have been caught
violating other coproduction contracts. In addition, he said the
Asian nation has refused to allow U.S. officials access to the M-16
plant since the subcommittee's revelations last year.
   Rep. Larry J. Hopkins of Kentucky, ranking Republican on the
panel, said: ``We have trusted them. We have caught them. And now
we are preparing to sign another deal with them.''
   The subcommittee held a closed-door hearing on Wednesday on the
coproduction plan for the fighter which calls for the South Korean
Air Force to acquire 120 FA-18 jets.
   Under the plan, Korea would buy the first 12 jets directly from
the U.S. manufacturer, McDonnell-Douglas. The company would then
supply kits to Korea to assemble the next 36 fighters. Korea would
assemble the final 72 with many of the components made in Korea.
   The Navy estimates that the total value of the fighter
coproduction contract for the United States is about $3 billion,
some $400 million less than if all 120 aircraft were built in the
United States.
   In releasing a statement on the hearing, the panel did not
identify the unfriendly nations, but it include a page from the
Daewoo Corp. annual report for 1988 which showed that the company
had sales offices in Libya, Iran and Iraq.
   Mavroules said those nations have been the principal buyers of
Korea's military exports from a number of Korean companies,
including Daewoo.
   ``Isn't it in their interest to prove to us that they have
cleaned up their act?'' Mavroules said of South Korea.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Bob Packwood said Thursday a special
provision of the Endangered Species Act could allow logging to
continue in the forests where the northern spotted owl lives, even
if the bird is declared threatened or endangered.
   Lawmakers in the Pacific Northwest are concerned that efforts to
save the owl from extinction will have a disastrous impact on the
regional economy because large tracts of federal forests could be
put off limits to loggers.
   Packwood, R-Ore., said in an interview Thursday the special
provision in the act, allowing a committee to consider possible
economic hardship, may provide a way to continue logging.
   ``When the Fish and Wildlife Service decides on the listing, it
is allowed to consider only biological factors. But this special
committee can also consider economic factors,'' Packwood said.
   The special committee would consist of the U.S. secretaries of
agriculture, interior and army, the administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency, the chairman of the Council of
Economic Advisors, the head of the National Oceanographic and
Atmospheric Administration and one individual from each of the
states effected.
   ``They would have the power to set aside the listing. In
essence, they could allow whatever economic activities to continue,
even if the species is listed,'' Packwood said.
   ``They would have to be sure to try not to affect the species.
But they would have the power to allow the continuation of logging
if they decided the payments to schools, the jobs of mill workers
and the economic viability of Oregon are more important than the
owl,'' he said.
   A request for the convening of the committee can be made by the
governor of a state effected, a federal agency involved in the case
or an ``interested party,'' Packwood said.
   ``I don't know if I qualify as an interested party, but I don't
think we would have any trouble finding someone to make the
request. I'm going to call the governor of Oregon and talk about
this,'' he said.
   Brock Evans, vice president of the National Audubon Society,
said he doubted the special committee process would have any impact
if the Fish and Wildlife Service decides to list the owl as
threatened or endangered _ a decision due by June 23.
   ``We've said all along that the more public attention we get,
the better off we are. We can't wait for this to become a national
issue. I can see it now, the Today Show and everyone else would be
running programs on us,'' he said.
   Evans said a report issued Wednesday by a government panel of
scientists leaves no question that logging must stop across a large
section of national forests in order to save the spotted owl.
   ``I think the science is overwhelming now. If a special
extinction committee ruled against it, it would be clear that it
was a blatant political act,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dozen Arrested in Raids Aimed at Basque Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAYONNE, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police arrested a dozen people and seized
explosives, rockets and grenades in raids aimed a Basque terrorist
group believed responsible for 29 murders, investigators said
Thursday.
   Police identified only two of the suspects, all French, arrested
in the raids Wednesday and Thursday. They were Frederic Haramboure,
36, and Jacques Esnal, 39.
   Both are suspected by Spanish authorities of plotting a car
bombing with Frenchman Henri Barot, who was arrested Monday in
Seville, Spain, with a car loaded with 660 pounds of explosives,
police said.
   The raids on the southwest French Atlantic coast near the
Spanish border included Bayonne, Saint-Jean-de-Luz, Urrugne and
Guethary. They netted nearly nine pounds of explosives, three
assault rifles, three machine-pistols, two handguns, three rockets
and four grenades.
   Police claim Haramboure, Esnal and Barot belong to the
Abertzalis terrorist group, which has strong links to the ETA
movement that seeks independence for Spain's Basques.
   Spanish authorities believe the group is responsible for 29
deaths since 1978, among them two judges, three generals, a vice
admiral and 11 soldiers, police said.
   ETA is not active in the Pyrenees regions of France, though
members often cross the border to take refuge with sympathizers.
   At least 10 other people were held for questioning in what
police described as the largest anti-ETA operation carried out on
French soil in a decade.
   ETA, whose initials stand for Homeland and Liberty in the Basque
language, has killed more than 600 people since 1968 in its
campaign for independence for the three-province Spanish Basque
region.

<HEAD>Conyers Writes Pentagon About Unisys Computers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of a House panel called on the
Pentagon to stop accepting orders of computer hardware and software
from the Unisys Corp. that may not meet specifications.
   ``It appears that Air Force personnel may have improperly
waived, ignored or postponed compliance with technical requirements
of the contract,'' Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., said in letters
dated March 29 but released Thursday.
   Conyers' House Government Operations Committee has been
investigating the Air Force contract with Unisys for 250,000 of its
Desktop III computer systems after receiving allegations of
mismanagement.
   The eight-year contract is estimated at more than $1.5 billion,
said a committee staffer who requested anonymity.
   In a letter to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, Conyers urged that
the Air Force tell the company not to ship products or accept
orders until specific actions had been taken.
   Among those steps is requiring Unisys to correct all functional
test demonstration deficiencies within a reasonable time and
according to the contract's provisions.
   In addition, Conyers said, the Air Force should restest each
corrective action by Unisys to ensure compliance with the contract.

<HEAD>Emergency Crews Pack Up as Fuel Spill Dissipates</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Emergency crews packed up their gear and city water officials in
West Virginia and Ohio breathed easier Thursday as a fuel spill in
the Ohio River dissipated to nearly undetectable levels.
   ``It's evaporating and emulsifying to the point where we're not
actively monitoring it anymore,'' said Jeanne Ison, a spokeswoman
for the Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Commission. ``Our crews
are on their way home.''
   The diluted spill is all that remains of at least 75,000 gallons
of diesel oil, gasoline and kerosene that spilled into a tributary
of the Allegheny River above Pittsburgh last Friday, forcing
western Pennsylvania cities to close water intakes.
   The Allegheny and Monongahela rivers meet in Pittsburgh to form
the Ohio River.
   Officials in Toronto, Ohio, and Weirton, W.Va., near the
Pennsylvania border said they planned to keep river water intakes
closed until Friday afternoon. Both towns shut down their water
filtration plants Wednesday in anticipation of the spill.
   ``We're running on wells, 100 percent now,'' said Larry Coxen,
foreman at the Weirton water treatment plant. ``We don't want to
take any chances. We're meeting all our demands and we'll probably
go with the wells another day just to make sure.''
   Across the river in Steubenville, Ohio, officials mixed
activated carbon and chemicals with river water to remove any
remaining petroleum.
   ``So far, we haven't picked up anything that's noticeable, even
before the water is treated,'' said John West, an operator at the
Steubenville plant. ``We're operating normally. There's not a whole
lot of concern here ...''
   Twenty-five miles upstream, at East Liverpool, Ohio, two water
intakes near the river's surface remained closed to avoid floating
or suspended oil. A deeper intake remained open to draw water for
the town of 7,000.
   Officials at Wheeling, W.Va., about 25 miles downstream from
Weirton, canceled an emergency planning meeting that had been
scheduled for Thursday.
   ``To be honest, I haven't even talked to anybody about the spill
in two days, that's how concerned we are,'' said Conrad Slanina,
Wheeling's acting public works director. ``We don't anticipate any
problems at all.''
   ``It's gotten to the point where we can just have water plants
check it for us,'' said Chris Norman, an environmental engineer at
the Cincinnati-based Ohio River sanitation commission, which
oversees pollution control on the river.
   ``The organic matter in the water has dissipated so much that
it's easily treatable, but it does still need to be treated,''
Norman said. ``There should be no worry about drinking water and
little concern about the spill's effect on wildlife.''
   Pennsylvania officials on Thursday were assessing the damage to
fish, insects and wildlife.
   Thomas J. Qualters of the State Fish Commission said authorities
recovered about a dozen dead fish along the spill's path. He said
more fish could have been killed but have not yet floated to the
surface.
   The impact could be much more serious if the spill interfered
with spawning, which occurs at this time of year for various
species, said Qualters.
   Most Pennsylvania towns affected by the spill have returned to
normal.
   Water conservation measures remained in effect in six
Pennsylvania communities and residents of Harrison County, the only
area where taps went dry, were still being advised to boil water as
a precaution.
   Guillermo Cole, a spokesman for the Allegheny County (Pa.) Water
Department, said tests conducted Wednesday indicated the water is
nearly back to normal. But health officials were concerned about
globs of oil that could get into some intakes.

<HEAD>Groundwater Tests To Be Conducted In Nine States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Corn Belt has been selected for a new
testing program designed to protect groundwater from contamination
by fertilizers and pesticides, Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter said Wednesday.
   Yeutter said the research, scheduled to begin this summer, will
be undertaken on farmland overlying aquifers in nine states: Iowa,
Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota,
Ohio and Wisconsin.
   The research is part of a government-wide water quality
initiative provided in the Bush administration's budget requests,
he said.
   Spending for all of the Agriculture Department's water quality
activities this year is budgeted at $158 million, compared with
$112.7 million last year, Yeutter said. The administration's
request for the fiscal 1991 year that will begin Oct. 1 is for $207
million.
   Yeutter said about $3.7 million of this year's funds has been
targeted for the Corn Belt projects.
   C. Richard Amerman of the department's Agricultural Research
Service said the sites were selected because corn and soybeans are
grown extensively, using relatively large amounts of agricultural
chemicals.
   Amerman, who is executive secretary of USDA's working group on
water quality, said researchers ``will evaluate the environmental
and economic impacts of various farming practices'' on underground
water supplies.
   ``We also will develop and implement new farming practices,'' he
said. ``In each area, we'll seek advice from farm, community,
agribusiness and environmental representatives.''
   Amerman said the project ``should have broad national
significance'' because information from it can be applied to other
parts of the country.

<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk and
Nelson Mandela agreed Thursday on a new date for formal talks
between the government and the African National Congress on giving
blacks a share of political power in South Africa.
   De Klerk and Mandela, freed Feb. 11 by the president after 27
years in prison, met for three hours but said the time and place
for talks to replace a canceled April 11 meeting would be announced
later. The two did not appear together afterwards.
   Instead, at separate news conferences, de Klerk said he objected
to the ANC pressuring some tribal homeland leaders not to meet with
the government earlier Thursday while Mandela said ``nothing could
be further from the truth'' than charges of ANC intimidation.
   Next Wednesday's talks were to have been the government's first
meeting with a delegation of exiled and internal ANC leaders, but
the ANC canceled to protest against police firing on demonstrators,
killing at least 11 protesters.
   De Klerk said he was considering appointing a judicial inquiry
into the March 26 shootings in Sebokeng, south of Johannesburg, and
that an investigation had begun.
   Mandela said the inquest being presided over by a white judge
was not conducive to gaining the black community's confidence. He
said an inquiry commission should include credible black leaders.
   De Klerk said they also discussed the widespread political
violence in the country ``frankly and clearly. ... I had the
impression that there is a general agreement that violence had to
come to an end and that there was a need for creating an atmosphere
in which normal political processes could take place.''
   Mandela said ``solid progress'' had been made in a ``cordial and
productive'' atmosphere.
   The talks were intended to discuss black factional violence that
has left hundreds dead in recent weeks, and to help prepare for
formal negotiations on a new constitution to give blacks a share of
power in South Africa.
   Earlier Thursday during an impromptu news conference, de Klerk
said, ``I don't have a problem finding anyone to sit down with me.
I just have a problem with those who want to sit down and who don't
want to allow others to sit down with them.''
   Mandela and other ANC leaders have called for unity among all
black political factions in order to present a solid front at
eventual negotiations with the white-minority government.
   De Klerk said some homeland leaders had been pressured not to
come and ``that choice was not voluntary in any sense of the word.''
   However, every homeland leader that the government-run
television interviewed Thursday night denied being pressured by the
ANC. Mandela said he spoke to three of the homeland leaders after
they had told him of their decision not to meet with the government.
   De Klerk told reporters that during his meeting with Mandela,
``I made the point that no one should inhibit discussions which
need to take place on the widest possible scale.''
   In addition to Mandela, de Klerk had been scheduled to meet with
six homeland leaders, but four did not show up.
   However, many South African officials and observers believe the
ANC canceled the meeting because of internal disagreements about
how to proceed with negotiations.
   De Klerk and his Cabinet have repeated that they want all
currently recognized leaders to participate in negotiations.
   But the ANC does not recognize the legitimacy of homeland
governments and their leaders. It says the plan of dividing black
South Africans into 10 tribal areas deprives them of their
citizenship, land ownership and work rights and leaves the majority
of the country for whites.
   Four of the 10 homelands have accepted independence, but they
are not recognized as independent by other countries. Those leaders
were not invited to the talks.
   Of the six who were invited, two showed up: KwaZulu chief
minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Qwaqwa chief minister Kenneth
Mopeli. Buthelezi heads the Zulu tribe's conservative Inkatha
movement and is seen as Mandela's main black rival.
   Meanwhile in Venda, the smallest of the so-called independent
homelands, there was a report of a coup Thursday over the issue of
independence. A radio announcement in the homeland said Frank
Ravele, president of Venda, was overthrown in a military coup.
   The deputy chief of Venda's Defense Force, Gabriel Ramushwana,
said he wanted the homeland reincorporated into South Africa and
staged the coup.

<HEAD>District Police Chief Says Federal Anti-Drug Efforts Failing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal initiative to stem drug abuse and
related violence in the nation's capital has failed, the city's
police chief said Thursday.
   A spokesman for federal drug policy coordinator William J.
Bennett also said one lesson learned from the year-long effort was
that ``civic resolve'' is needed to make any anti-drug program a
success.
   A senior spokesman for Bennett later backed away from that
comment, saying Bennett doesn't believe Washington residents lack
the resolve needed to reduce drug abuse.
   Isaac Fulwood, the District of Columbia's police chief,
acknowledged that the special anti-drug effort announced a year ago
by Bennett has not lived up to expectations.
   ``I think there's enough blame to go around for everybody,''
Fulwood said. ``I would say everything has failed right now because
we haven't turned it around. Victory won't be declared until we
stop the murders.''
   However, City Administrator Carol B. Thompson said: ``We think
we have made great strides in addressing the problem.''
   The federal government originally promised to direct an extra
$100 million to drug programs in the district, primarily for
additional jail space. That money has gone unspent because the city
has failed to agree on a plan for jail construction.
   The administration also assigned military prosecutors to
district drug cases, offered money for new drug treatment centers
and established a special Drug Enforcement Administration team.
   Bennett spokesman David Robb said Thursday that one of the
lessons learned from the special effort was that ``lack of civic
resolve on the part of citizens in any city can block efforts'' to
control the drug problem.
   But Don Hamilton, Bennett's main spokesman, later disavowed
Robb's comment.
   ``It is not the view of the office or of director Bennett that
there is any lack of resolve on the part of the citizens of the
District or anywhere else'' to combat drugs, Hamilton said. ``We
don't believe there is a lack of citizen resolve.''
   Robb had cited the district's failure to find a site for a
pre-trial detention center that Bennett pushed a year ago when he
announced the intensified battle against drugs.
   ``Everyone needs to play a part in this,'' Robb said. ``That's
the lesson that you learn from D.C.''
   Robb and Hamilton both refused to confirm or deny whether the
12-month report on federal efforts to curtail Washington's drug
problem will say it's been a failure, as The New York Times
reported.
   ``We have committed ourselves to report on both successes and
failures every six months,'' Robb said.
   Bennett and city officials said a news conference to announce
the update has been scheduled for April 13.
   There have been 127 homicides in the nation's capital so far in
1990. The city recorded a record 438 in 1989. Authorities have
blamed more than 60 percent on drugs.
   Unidentified federal officials told the Times that Washington
has failed to demonstrate a commitment to control drug abuse.
   The sources blamed Bennett, saying he oversold the program and
failed to back up his promises with federal funds, the newspaper
reported.
   Both city and federal officials agreed that illegal drugs remain
relatively cheap and plentiful and drug-related murders have not
abated.
   ``We need to improve the lines of communication,'' Fulwood said.
   Fulwood said the city has made progress in expanding
community-based street patrols and other anti-crime programs.
   Hamilton said the report was not completed.
   ``I don't think we're going to say everything in D.C. is
hunky-dory and we should get a ride down Pennsylvania Avenue on
rose petals, but the report's not done yet,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dixon Asks Bush To Explain Why Executive Order Not Issued</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., asked President Bush
on Thursday to explain why he has not issued an executive order
ensuring that Chinese students would not be sent home against their
will.
   ``I am quite concerned about recent statements from the White
House spokesman, Mr. (Marlin) Fitzwater, concerning your promise to
issue an executive order protecting the Chinese students in this
country,'' Dixon said in a letter to Bush.
   Fitzwater said Wednesday that Bush did not issue the order
covering the students _ as he said in January he would _ and relied
instead on a directive by Attorney General Dick Thornburgh.
   That directed the head of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service to protect the Chinese students, many of whom did not want
to return home after last June's crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrators.
   But Dixon said Bush should issue the executive order as
promised. If Bush does not take such action, Dixon said he will
introduce legislation to protect the students as their visas to
study in the United States expire.
   Similiar legislation became a target of controversy earlier this
year. Congress passed it, but it was vetoed by Bush. The House
overrode the veto, but in the Senate the override effort fell short
of the necessary two-thirds majority.

<TEXT>
   Savage shelling broke out at sundown
Thursday between rival Christian forces, leaving 14 people dead,
east Beirut ablaze and shattering a brief cease-fire requested by
church leaders.
   Flames lighted the night sky. Huge clouds of smoke obscured much
of the embattled Christian enclave north of the capital as shells
and rockets rained down from mountaintop and coastal positions.
   ``Hundreds of cars are smoldering and dozens of apartment
buildings as well as hospitals and churches are burning. Nothing is
being spared,'' said a police spokesman, who gave the toll as 14
dead and 27 wounded.
   ``Thousands of families in east Beirut and Jounieh are in
basements and bomb shelters seeking refuge from the mad
bombardment.''
   Police said the four-story building housing renegade Gen. Michel
Aoun's radio and television stations in east Beirut's Hazmiyeh
district was burning after taking a barrage of phosphorous bombs.
Both stations went off the air.
   Aoun's gunners targeted the Voice of Lebanon radio station and
the Lebanese Broadcasting Corp. TV station, outlets of the Lebanese
Forces militia of his rival Christian military chief, Samir Geagea,
the spokesman said.
   ``We're taking a lot of shells but so far we're all okay,'' said
an announcer over Voice of Lebanon.
   The station's 14-story building is in east Beirut's Ashrafiyeh
district.
   Lebanese Broadcasting's TV station in the Christian port of
Jounieh, 12{ miles north of Beirut, said shells fell near its
buildings but it was not hit.
   A salvo set off fiery explosions at a Lebanese Forces ammunition
depot in Jeita near Jounieh, said the police spokesman, whose name
cannot be used under standing rules.
   The struggle for control of the Christian enclave has killed 855
people and wounded 2,325 since it began Jan. 30, and inflicted $1
billion worth of damage.
   The violence broke a lull of a few hours after Aoun and Geagea
told their fighters to abide by a truce called by Maronite Catholic
clergymen.
   It was the 16th cease-fire in the fighting _ and the shortest.
   Twenty Maronite church leaders under Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir
warned that the Geagea-Aoun war was threatening the Christians'
``very existence in Lebanon and the Orient.''
   Syrian-backed President Elias Hrawi told an agricultural
delegation that visited him in Moslem west Beirut his government
was prepared to take over control of all army garrisons in the
Christian enclave.
   But he did not indicate he was ready to order his 22,000
predominantly Moslem troops, under Gen. Emile Lahoud, to force
their way into the Christian enclave.
   Hrawi's address was broadcast by several radio stations.
   In what appeared to be a call to Aoun's troops to give up their
loyalty to the general, Hrawi said, ``I hope that the military in
the eastern areas will be true to its oath of maintaining loyalty
to Lebanon ... not to individuals.''
   Because of the confrontation, about 250,000 people _ one-quarter
of the Christian enclave's original 1 million population _ have
fled the region to seek refuge in safer areas of Lebanon and in
neighboring countries.
   Aoun, Geagea, Hrawi and Lahoud are Maronites, the largest
Christian community in Lebanon.
   The Maronites have traditionally controlled key government
posts, the army command, and judiciary since independence from
France in 1943.
   Hrawi was elected by Lebanon's parliament that also adopted a
peace plan last year giving Moslems a 50 per cent share of power.
Aoun balked, and refused to accept Hrwai's presidency and Hrawi's
dismissal of him as army commander.
   The clergymen called the cease-fire hours after Geagea said he
was prepared to hand over to Lahoud the three army camps in the
Kersrouan and Byblos provinces controlled by his militia north of
Beirut.

<TEXT>
   The former East German secret police
eavesdropped on the telephone conversations of Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, President Richard von Weiszaecker and at least 10,000 other
West German officials, a newspaper reported Thursday.
   Cabinet ministers, businessmen and the leadership of the armed
forces also had their phones tapped, the conservative West German
daily Die Welt said in an article released to news media in advance
of its publication Friday.
   The outgoing Communist-led government ordered the hated secret
police, known as Stasi, dissolved in December following a peaceful
revolution that ousted dictator Erich Honecker.
   There were numerous demonstrations and violent takeovers of
secret police buildings by angry citizens.
   The Stasi force once had 85,000 paid agents and more than
100,000 informers among East Germany's 16 million citizens.
   The huge eavesdropping operation was performed with powerful
transmitters and computers stationed in East Germany and
neighboring Czechoslovakia, the newspaper said.
   The computers were programmed to recognize certain numbers and
could even pick up calls placed from telephones with secret
numbers, Die Welt said.
   The article cited unidentified Western security officials as
saying the folders with the secret numbers must be kept from
falling into the hands of the Soviet KGB.
   The Stasi's special monitoring service was saved from
dissolution by the army, which continued to monitor the West German
telephone calls despite growing links between the two German states
and during East Germany's free elections last month, the report
said.

<HEAD>Senate Authorizes Aid, But Leaves Without Appropriating The Money</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Thursday approved legislation
authorizing U.S. aid to the new democratic governments in Panama
and Nicaragua, but President Bush's deadline for action on a more
important money bill for those countries slipped by without a vote.
   On a voice vote, the Senate approved a measure that would permit
spending of up to $470 million this year to aid Panama and $300
million for Nicaragua. It also included $30 million for Africa and
$70 million to pay costs of resettling Soviet Jewish emigres in the
United States.
   The new spending would be paid for through cuts in the Pentagon
budget in what amounts to the government's first application of a
``peace dividend'' from reduced East-West tensions.
   To provide aid to the two Central American countries, Congress
must first authorize the aid programs, then pass separate
legislation appropriating the money for them. Bush had sought
completion of the entire cycle by Thursday, but Congress left for a
12-day Easter recess without doing so.
   The House has passed a $2.4 billion money bill that includes
$420 million for Panama and $300 million for Nicaragua, but
companion legislation to authorize the spending is mired in the
Foreign Affairs Committee.
   The Senate passed its authorizing bill on Thursday, but will not
act on the crucial money legislation until it returns to Washington
on April 18.
   Aid proponents have argued that the two countries' economies,
battered by U.S. trade sanctions and by military action, need quick
infusions of aid to stabilize the new democratic governments and to
demonstrate the benefits of democracy.
   ``We need to make sure democracy has a chance to take root and
flourish,'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn. ``That's not going
to happen if people find they are no better off tomorrow than they

<TEXT>
   Frederic Castet charged back into the fashion arena
with several shows in his new fur and fashion shop this week.
   After 20 years as fur creator at Dior, Castet bowed out when new
management came in over two years ago.
   Now, with backing from banks and friends, he has launched his
own firm and boutique in the fashion district near the
Champs-Elysees.
   And he's feeling bullish about furs, because France is a country
where animal-rights campaigns are relatively modest. Many
Frenchwomen are proud to wear coats from ``unendangered'' species,
such as sable, fox or mink.
   In any case, Castet has covered all the options.
   He's patented a soft new fake fur called ``Castiss,'' which he
uses cleverly in everything from white greatcoats to linings for
mink. It looks a lot like sheared raccoon, beaver or even seal,
depending on how Castet uses it.
   The show-stoppers were cartoon mink coats _ colorfully cut to
show an Eiffel Tower in homage to France, a Statue of Liberty for
the United States and a cheery tribesman for Africa.
   They were reminders of Castet's command of the leather-and-fur
medium. He was the first to introduce ``pictures'' in mink coats at
Dior some 15 years ago.
   But there was lots more to point up the talent of this creator
from Toulouse in the south of France.
   The line also included beautifully cut trouser and short skirts
suits in fine gabardine or cash wool, tulip-draped silk dresses,
and several ensembles splashed with Castet's optimistic logo, a
sunflower.
   Even more surprising were the cute young numbers such as leather
shorts fringed in Tibetan lamb, topped by an organza blouse.
   If he has overall fashion versatility, it's not surprising.
Castet started training very young following World War II with the
Chambre Syndicale couture school, garnering a first prize.
   He then went on to work in general design creation for
Balenciaga and Christian Dior.
   But his forte is still fur. His shortie coats or blouson styles,
his ``sunray'' effects in 1940s-style minks, are given a snappy
update and have peppy appeal for all ages.
   And the ``marquetry'' effect that Castet does in bands of dark
Saga mink are nothing short of miraculous.
   After a show, Castet said that in spite of assistance, he'd
really ended up doing everything himself.
   ``I need a vacation,'' he said, looking forward to a visit south.
   For those interested in Castet fashions, the prices are on the
average level for luxury couture ready-to-wear, a couple of
thousand dollars for a suit ensemble.
   Castet's coats vary tremendously, from about $1,000 or less for
a Castiss fake leopard model blouson or flared coat to over
$130,000 for the most elaborate sable creation.
   The shop also offers more affordable accessories, bracelets,
belts, earrings based on the ``golden triangle'' or sunflower
themes.

<HEAD>Museum Heading Into Court as Controversial Exhibit Opens</HEAD>

   A museum planning to exhibit sexually graphic
photographs by the late Robert Mapplethorpe has signed up hundreds
of patrons in the 10 days before Friday's opening, the director
said.
   The 175-photograph exhibit includes nine pictures of nude
children or homoerotic and sadomasochistic sex acts. It has
prompted a police investigation and opposition from
anti-pornography groups.
   Director Dennis Barrie said he expects 3,000 ticketholders to
attend the opening, which is restricted to members of the
Contemporary Arts Center. The exhibit opens to the public Saturday.
   ``We're going to have to regulate the flow into the gallery,''
Barrie said Thursday. ``We've handled about 1,000 people in here at
once, but that was our maximum.''
   About 400 people have paid $25 to $150 to become museum patrons
in the last 10 days, Barrie said. In a normal 1{-week stretch, the
museum would be lucky to sign 10 members, he said.
   The Arts Center sued city and county law enforcement officials,
seeking a decision on whether the exhibit violates local obscenity
standards. A hearing on the city's request to dismiss the lawsuit
was scheduled for Friday before Hamilton County Muncipal Judge
Edward L. Donnellon.
   Assistant City Solicitor Karl P. Kadon III said he intends to
argue that the lawsuit is based on ``hypothetical facts'' because
police haven't taken any action against the museum.
   An attorney for the museum, Marc Mezibov, said the lawsuit is
justified because of the public dispute over the exhibit and police
threats of criminal charges.
   Attorneys for the Arts Center on Wednesday filed a motion in the
lawsuit for a judgment by Donnellon that the entire exhibit is
constitutionally protected because it is art, despite the sexually
graphic pictures. If Donnellon does not grant a judgment, the case
would go to trial.
   In a supporting affidavit, Bruce H. Evans, director of the
Dayton Art Institute, said the exhibit demonstrates Mapplethorpe's
skill as a photographer as well as the range of emotional reaction
his works produce.
   ``It can be, for example, the breathtaking sense of simple
beauty of a human figure or floral still-life or ... a
gut-wrenching sense of disgust to acts of human sadism,'' Evans
said.
   Mapplethorpe, who was born in Floral Park, N.Y., died of AIDS in
March 1989 at the age of 42.
   Kadon said he couldn't comment on the request because he hadn't
received a copy.
   Police Chief Larry Whalen has called the photographs criminally
obscene but has not said whether police plan to file charges.
Whalen did not return telephone calls Thursday seeking comment.
   More than 1,000 museum supporters staged a demonstration
Wednesday protesting police involvement in the dispute. Barrie, the
director, said he was surprised at the breadth of popular support.
   ``We hear it from people in grocery stores and on elevators,''
he said. ``I'm not exaggerating. I get on an elevator and total
strangers tell me, `Keep the faith.'''

<HEAD>Two Americans, Sherpa Guide Killed in Himalayan Climb</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Americans and their Sherpa guide died
in an avalanche more than halfway up the world's seventh-highest
mountain on the Nepal-Tibet border, the Tourism Ministry said
Thursday.
   Charles Schertz, 35, of Pittsburgh, Nancy Jackson of Federal
Way, Wash., and Nima Wanchu, 41, were found buried in the snow
March 27 by other members of the American Manaslu Expedition,
according to the Tourism Ministry and Dan McConnell, spokesman for
the Seattle-based team. Nepalese officials said Jackson's passport
said she was 43, but McConnell said she was 34.
   McConnell said two others escaped the accident, which occurred
at the 15,510-foot level of Mount Manaslu, a 26,775-foot mountain
in the Himalayan range. It is one of the Himalaya's lesser climbed
peaks because of its remoteness.
   Climber Steve Steckmyer, 39, of Seattle, escaped the direct path
of the avalanche, while another Sherpa was partially buried but
pulled himself out. Steckmyer stayed behind to look for his
teammates while the Sherpa descended to get help and ran into the
other climbers, who were coming up from the base camp with gear,
McConnell said.
   Poor communications delayed news of the deaths, said the
Ministry of Tourism, which serves as a clearinghouse for Himalayan
climbs.
   ``We are shocked and shattered by the loss of our good friends,
Nancy, Charlie and Nima Wanchu in this tragic accident,'' team
leader Don Goodman said in a news release.
   Goodman, of Mercer Island, Wash., flew to Katmandu, Nepal, and
said the remaining members of the 12-person team abandoned the
climb and would be returning home after the bodies are cremated at
a monastery near Manaslu.
   McConnell said the team is not expected to return to the United
States for 10-14 days.
   Jackson, an environmental engineer, climbed Mount Rainier more
than 50 times as a guide during the 1980s and reached the summits
of Mount McKinley in Alaska and Aconcagua in Argentina.
   Schertz, a physician, was one of two climbing doctors on the
expedition. He was a member of the 1988 Northwest American Everest
Expedition and part of the first American ascent of Cho Oyu in the
Himalayas in 1986.

<HEAD>Health Officials Investigate Bacteria Blamed in 11 Denver-Area
Deaths</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rare, virulent form of strep is on the rise in
at least six states and has been blamed for 11 Denver-area deaths,
investigators trying to determine who else is at risk said Thursday.
   Another 29 cases have been reported in Denver in the last six
months. The fatality rate is about 25 percent, health officials say.
   Investigations were under way in parts of Colorado, Alabama,
Arizona, California, Maryland and Ohio, where severe strep clusters
have been reported. Since Sept. 1, 40 severe strep case have been
reported in those states, said Dr. Ben Schwartz, an epidemiologist
in the CDC's respiratory disease branch in Atlanta.
   Forty severe strep cases have been reported since Sept. 1,
Schwartz said.
   ``The strep bacteria has been around a million years and we're
learning more about it to prevent people from getting it. It's
actually rather mundane,'' Dr. Roger Gollub, epidemic intelligence
service officer for the Colorado Department of Health, said in
Denver.
   The outbreak ``has nothing to do with (common) strep throat,''
Gollub said. ``It's just the strep organism is involved.'' All the
victims were elderly and suffering from other illnesses, too,
Gollub said.
   Common strep symptoms are a sore throat, swollen glands and
fever. They can be treated with penicillin.
   The severe form of strep is characterized by a sudden onset of a
very high fever, chills, shock and low blood pressure. There also
may be skin or muscle infections and pneumonia, the investigators
said.
   The severe form, known as group A streptococcus bacteremia, gets
past the body's primary defenses and enters the bloodstream through
injury, infection from a surgical incision, or other ways that are
still unclear.
   Much of the information on the disease that's been collected by
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control has come from Denver, said
Schwartz.
   Nationally, cases of severe strep have occurred at a rate of
five per 10,000 population per year.
   Health officials around the country ``have expressed interest in
working with us and we think it gives a good geographical,
rural-urban mix to the investigation,'' Schwartz said. ``It's not
because there have been any problems in those areas; it just gives
us a better picture.''
   Health officials started investigating the bacteria a year ago
when a cluster of cases was noticed in Denver.
   ``A year ago a very smart, perceptive infection control nurse at
a local hospital noticed nine cases in a six-week period and since
then we have been looking into it,'' Gollub said.
   Schwartz said he did not want people getting the impression that
they can die from strep throat or that the disease is rampant.
   ``The important thing to realize is that strep throat is very
common, all kids get it and this is actually strep throat season,''
he said. ``Parents should really not be worrying that it is going
to be turning into the severe disease.''
   But, Schwartz said, if a parent believes that his child has
strep throat, it should be diagnosed and treated.
   A Denver doctor is working with the World Health Organization to
investigate a possible link with a reported strep outbreak in
Europe. Schwartz said the CDC also is in contact with European
health officials and has heard of some problems in Scandinavia and
England.

   An experimental Pegasus
rocket was blasted into space Thursday from a B-52 and successfully
delivered its first satellite payload into a polar orbit, officials
said.
   ``Pegasus is on its way,'' F-18 chase plane pilot Jim Molka
radioed to controllers at 12:11 p.m. as the 50-foot rocket was
dropped from its perch beneath the jet's right wing.
   ``It looked like a little shuttle heading toward the sky,''
bomber pilot Gordon Fullerton said.
   Twelve minutes later, tracking crews at the Ames-Dryden Flight
Research Facility at Edwards determined the 440-pound satellite had
successfully reached orbit 368 miles above Earth.
   ``Everything went according to the mission profile,'' said C.J.
Fenrick, spokesman for Ames-Dryden. ``This is a big step for the
Air Force, NASA and private corporations interested in space.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle praised the mission's success.
   ``Today's Pegasus launch marks an important achievement for the
emerging commercial launch industry,'' Quayle said in a statement.
``This initiative holds great promise for not only the aerospace
industry but for the U.S. space program as well.''
   Strapped beneath the right wing of the gleaming white and silver
bomber, Pegasus was flown to 43,000 feet over the military's
Western Test Range in the ocean off Southern California.
   The 41,000-pound rocket was released and appeared to fall free
for five seconds, then streaked into space trailing a fiery ribbon
of smoke.
   The delta-winged first-stage booster flew to 200,000 feet, then
second- and third-stage rocket engines ignited to carry Pegasus
into low orbit to eject it and its Navy satellite.
   Developed by Virginia-based Orbital Sciences Corp. and
Delaware-based Hercules Aerospace Corp., Pegasus was designed to
put small satellites into orbit at low cost. It has been called the
poor man's satellite booster.
   ``You are watching history, guys,'' Orbital Sciences spokeswoman
Barbara Zedina told reporters. ``I can't believe it. You go over
this so many times in your mind. It's wonderful.''
   The estimated cost of a Pegasus launch was between $6 million
and $8 million, a fraction of the cost of an Atlas or Titan rocket
firing, officials said.
   The Pentagon and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration want to use Pegasus for military and science
satellites, but Pegasus also is expected to attract business from
companies, foreign governments and university scientists who need a
cheap way to put small payloads in orbit.
   In addition to placement of the Navy communications satellite,
two other missions were accomplished, said Jan Bodanyi of the
Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
   Remaining on the frame was an instrument package to send data
back to scientists about the stress on Pegasus and its payload as
it goes through the atmosphere and into space, Bodanyi said.
   Two canisters designed to release chemicals to produce an
artificial ``northern lights'' effect also were aboard.
   Barium, mixed with a small amount of strontium, released over
central Canada will allow NASA scientists to study the resulting
glowing space cloud to learn more about the Earth's magnetosphere
and ionosphere.
   Skies were clear when the rocket-bearing jet took off at 11:04
a.m. from the Mojave Desert military base 60 miles north of Los
Angeles. The mission was scrubbed Wednesday because of rainy
weather.

<HEAD>Parliament to Convene Next Week to Approve Peres-led Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parliament speaker announced Thursday that
he would convene the legislature next Wednesday to approve the new
government pieced together by Labor Party leader Shimon Peres.
   Peres wanted parliament, which is in recess, to convene Sunday,
allowing the rival Likud bloc less time to win back a lawmaker who
defected to Labor's side and to convince smaller left-wing parties
to withold support for Peres.
   Before announcing his decision, the speaker, Dov Shilansky,
consulted with fellow Likud colleague Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
after the attorney general ruled parliament must be convened ``as
soon as possible.''
   He told army radio he reached his decision on Wednesday out of
religious, not political, considerations. Shilansky said Sunday was
ruled out so observant Jewish parliament members could be home for
a religious ceremony preparing themselves for next week's Passover
holiday, which commemorates the exodus of Israelites from biblical
Egypt.
   Meanwhile, Peres met with leaders of three left-wing parties to
urge them to return to his new government so the Middle East peace
process could continue.
   The parties control 10 of the 120 seats in parliament but have
been critical of Labor's tactics in trying to form a new government.
   On Wednesday, Peres informed President Chaim Herzog he had
succeeded in stitching together a ruling coalition. The
announcement came two weeks after he was assigned to replace Shamir.
   Shamir lost a no-confidence vote March 15 in a crisis triggered
by a dispute over U.S. conditions for holding Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks. Peres forced the showdown with Shamir, who was
reluctant to accept the U.S. proposals on forming a Palestinian
delegation.
   Peres declined to reveal who would be in his coalition, saying
secrecy was needed to woo other supporters. He is believed to have
only 61 or 62 members of the parliament pledged to support his
leadership.
   If Peres succeeds, it would be the first time since 1977 that
the left-of-center Labor ruled without sharing power with Likud.

<HEAD>Researchers Say More Calcium Doesn't Prevent Bone Weakening</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bone-weakening osteoporosis cannot be
prevented by gorging on calcium-rich foods, University of Michigan
researchers said Thursday.
   ``We found that adults with high calcium intakes didn't lose
less bone and that adults with low calcium intakes didn't lose more
bone,'' said Stanley Garn, a professor of nutrition at the
university's School of Public Health.
   ``The more bone you have, the more you have to lose,'' he said
in a news release from the university. ``You don't create more bone
by stuffing calcium into young women any more than you create more
muscle by stuffing steak into football players.''
   The study was based on comparisons of X-ray measurements of 745
adult men's and women's hand bones taken from 1963-65 and again in
1985, the Ann Arbor university said. The subjects also reported
their eating habits, focusing on calcium and phosphorous intake.
   Osteoporosis, a softening of the bones, tends to begin with
women in their early 40s and with men in their 50s regardless of
their calcium intake, the researchers said in a study presented
Thursday at a joint meeting of the American Association of Physical
Anthropology and the Human Biology Council in Miami.
   The results were consistent with earlier studies in which Garn
and other researchers found that entire populations with high
calcium intake as part of their everyday diet suffered bone loss
comparable to groups eating a predominantly low-calcium, rice-based
diet.
   Dr. Richard Mazess, professor emeritus of medical physics at the
University of Wisconsin, endorsed the findings.
   ``They're entirely in accord with the rest of the scientific
evidence to date,'' Mazess said in a telephone interview. ``The
overwhelming evidence is that calcium has very little to do with
bone loss, except in people with marginal intake under 400
milligrams a day.''
   The average American's diet supplies 600-800 milligrams of
calcium daily, Mazess said. Calcium supplements might benefit those
receiving less, he said, but increasing consumption of dairy
products, the most common source of calcium, carries higher levels
of cholesterol and coronary risk.
   Exercise may help women prevent the disease, but the most
effective treatment is estrogen therapy beginning with menopause,
when the loss of bone mass tends to accelerate, Mazess said. ``It's
not a calcium-deficiency disease,'' he said.
   The Michigan study also found no relationship between cigarette
smoking, alcohol or the use of anti-hypertensive drugs and the
amount of bone loss.

<HEAD>Pastor Says List Acted out of Corrupted Religion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ELIZABETH, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Sunday school teacher killed his
wife, three children and mother in 1971 out of a corrupted
religious faith, his former Lutheran pastor testified Thursday.
   ``I think John's problem was he knew doctrine but he didn't know
faith,'' the Rev. Edward Saresky, pastor at Faith Lutheran Chuch in
Rochester, N.Y., said on the fourth day of John E. List's murder
trial.
   List, 64, a strictly raised Lutheran who attended Saresky's
church in the 1960s, ``didn't trust God'' to help him, so he tried
to help himself out of his problems, the pastor said.
   ``But that was a corruption,'' he said. ``Sin is never
justified.''
   Defense attorney Elijah L. Miller Jr. acknowledges that the
former accountant shot to death his wife, Helen, 46, their children
Patricia, 16; John, 15; and Frederick, 13; and his mother Alma, 85;
at their 19-room Westfield mansion on Nov. 9, 1971, but contends
List was insane.
   List was unable to deal with his family's diminishing religious
ties and the social turmoil of the 1960s and 1970s, Miller said. He
called clergymen and List's family members to paint a picture of
List's troubled youth and his family's troubles.
   The Rev. Herman Mayer, a pastor in Bay City, Mich., told of the
hard-working religious community in Frankenmuth, Mich., where
List's family emigrated as missionaries from Germany in the 19th
century.
   ``They had values, I would say, (of) good citizens, to be
upright, also to be prosperous,'' said Mayer, a robust 93-year-old
cleric.
   List's mother ``looked after him constantly'' as a boy and was
concerned about his safety when he played, said cousin Ralph List,
of Frankenmuth. He had few friends, and was born to a 60-year-old
father, the cousin said.
   Saresky said he saw tensions in the List home when List worked
for Xerox in Rochester from 1961 to 1964. List was working long
hours and failing to keep up with the company's expectations of
him, the pastor said.
   Saresky said he heard Helen List unfavorably compare List with
her first husband, a Green Beret who fought in the Korean War.
   ``She commented that if John were half the man her former
husband was, they wouldn't have the troubles they were having,''
Saresky testifed.
   Betty Jean Syfert said her sister, Helen List, dominated the
marriage. She acknowledged under questioning by Assistant Union
County Prosecutor Eleanor Clark that Mrs. List told her husband she
was pregnant when they married, but she didn't have a child that
year.
   Mrs. Syfert said Mrs. List's daughter by her first marriage
became pregnant at 16, causing tension in the family. Soon after,
Mrs. List started drinking, she said.
   On a visit to their home, Mrs. Syfert said she found her sister
confined to her bedroom, dirty and disheveled in an unkempt house.
Mrs. List also inexplicably fell from her chair, and defense lawyer
Miller indicated she frequently had to be taken to the hospital for
falls.
   ``I had no earthly idea of what was going on with her or the
house,'' said Mrs. Syfert.
   The attorney has said that Mrs. List was dying of syphilis at
the time she was killed. List was arrested in June in Richmond,
Va., where he had been living a new life under a different name.

   Polish President Woijech Jaruzelski will arrive
next week in Moscow for an official four-day visit, the Soviet news
agency Tass announced Thursday.
   Jaruzelski's visit will take place April 11-14, it said. No
further details were given.
   The announcement came two days after the Soviet government
closed the frontier between Lithuania and Poland, the Baltic
republic's only border that does not adjoin the Soviet territory.
   Lithuania declared independence from 50 years of Soviet rule on
March 11, entering into a bitter confrontation with Moscow.
   Soviet officials have also complained that Polish
representatives were treating Lithuania as a separate state.
   ``Such an action ... we cannot but see as intervention in the
internal affairs of the U.S.S.R.,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri
D. Gremitskikh told a press briefing Wednesday. ``We assume that
will be taken into account by the Polish side.''
   Despite their displeasure over Lithuania, the Soviets are
looking to Poland as an example for a radical economic reform _ in
essence the transition of a state economy to a market economy,
reportedly being considered in the Soviet Union.

   A Palestinian driver deliberately steered his
truck into an army foot patrol Thursday and seriously injured a
soldier, the army said.
   In that and other incidents in the occupied territories, two
Palestinians were killed and 18 Palestinians and one Israeli were
injured, reports said.
   An army statement said soldiers fired on the truck in Nablus in
the West Bank, wounding the driver in both legs. Israel radio said
the injured Israeli was a reserve officer standing 20 feet from the
road when he was struck.
   Youths began stoning the soldiers after the incident and the
troops fired, wounding at least three Palestinian teen-agers, Arab
witnesses said.
   Soldiers shot and killed two Palestinians during stone-throwing
clashes with youths in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Arab hospital
officials said.
   Fourteen other Palestinians were reported shot and wounded in
scattered other clashes with troops in the occupied lands. One
victim was a 2-year-old boy hit in the head with a rubber bullet,
Arab doctors said.
   In Nablus, the truck with a West Bank license plate careened
into the army patrol near the Askar Palestinian refugee camp on the
city's northern edge.
   ``It seems it was on purpose, that it was an attack,'' said an
army officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity. An official army
statement said the soldier was in serious condition and an
investigation was under way.
   The wounded driver and three passengers in the truck were
arrested, the army said.
   Immediately after the incident, soldiers fired rubber and
plastic bullets at stone-throwing youths, witnesses said. Doctors
at Al-Ittihad Hopital said the three people hurt included two
14-year-olds struck with rubber bullets.
   The army sealed off the area and declared a curfew on Askar,
ordering the camp's 8,000 residents to stay home, Arab reporters
said.
   In the Gaza Strip, Narwas Saleh el-Argeh, 23, was fatally shot
in clashes with a military patrol in the Rafah refugee camp,
hospital officials said. Arab reporters said news of his death
sparked rioting in the camp.
   In West Bank city of Ramallah, Mustafa Ali Jaro, 16, died after
being struck in the head by a rubber-coated steel ball used by the
army for riot control, hospital officials said.
   Arab reporters said Jaro, from nearby Jalazoun refugee camp, was
shot during clashes in the main square of Ramallah, six miles north
of Jerusalem.
   The army confirmed the shootings and said troops fired on both
occasions when they came under a hail of stones.
   The deaths brought to 672 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israeli soldiers or civilians during the 27-month-old uprising
against Israeli occupation. At least 202 other Palestinians have
been killed by fellow Arabs, most as suspected collaborators.
Forty-three Israelis also died in the violence.

   The self-styled leader of the
5-day-old uprising at Strangeways Prison said Thursday that inmates
had not meant to cause the riot that devastated the jail complex,
killed a prisoner and injured 49 people.
   Shouting to be heard over the din of a police helicopter
hovering above his rooftop post, Paul Taylor told reporters a
sit-in at the prison chapel was the plan on Sunday when he grabbed
the priest's microphone and urged others to act.
   ``At no time did anyone have any willful intention that we would
develop into a riot situation,'' Taylor, 28, yelled through a
makeshift megaphone to journalists below.
   The Home Office, which runs Britain's prisons, said four more
prisoners surrendered Thursday. Prison governor Brendan O'Friel
said fewer than 40 prisoners remained inside Strangeways.
   Barry Cuttle, a member of the negotiating team trying to
persuade prisoners to surrender, said 20 to 25 inmates remained on
the loose inside the 122-year-old prison.
   At a news conference Thursday, O'Friel reiterated his commitment
to negotiations to end the mutiny, calling them ``our main weapon.''
   Ivor Serle, chairman of the local chapter of the Prison Officers
Association, said Thursday, ``I can rule out the use of force, if
it takes a month we are not going to go in and bring them out. I'm
certain some of them want to surrender but they're being persuaded
not to.''
   Serle said 10 inmates are unaccounted for.
   O'Friel said a search of most areas of the prison found no
bodies, but added he ``could not rule out the possibility of
fatalities.''
   Some prisoners from Strangeways said after being transferred to
other prisons that they had seen bodies inside the prison. Reports
persisted of prisoners being hanged and tortured by fellow inmates.
   But the only death confirmed was that of prisoner Derek White,
46, who died in a hospital from injuries suffered in Sunday's riot.
   Thirty-six other inmates were injured and 13 prison guards were
hurt.
   Walter Scott, 46, a guard who had been on duty during the riot,
died Thursday, apparently after suffering a heart attack, the Home
Office said. It said Scott was not directly involved in combating
the riot.
   Home Secretary David Waddington began an inquiry into the riot
and siege.
   Rioters overpowered guards during Sunday chapel service, seized
their keys and gained access to other prison areas.
   Inmates' relatives say overcrowding, unsanitary conditions and
prisoners locked in their cells for up to 23 hours a day added to
tension.
   Strangeways was built in 1868 to hold 970 men. On Sunday it held
1,648.

<HEAD>Grandma Gets Credit For Weaning Boy From Ventilator</HEAD>

   A loving grandmother wouldn't give up despite
what doctors said, and helped her injured grandson learn to breathe
on his own again.
   Through her persistence and doctors' doubt, Dolores Anderson
helped 9-year-old Lortray Gordon learn to breathe for up to 10
hours a day without his ventilator.
   ``They said there was no way this kid could live. I refused to
hear that stuff,'' Mrs. Anderson said.
   ``They said he'd always be on a ventilator,'' she said. ``They
wanted me to put Tray away into an old folks' home. I said: `No
way, forget it.'''
   Janna Jacobs of the National Spinal Cord Injury Association near
Boston said it is unusual for a family member to accomplish what
Mrs. Anderson did.
   ``What a brave lady,'' Ms. Jacobs said. ``I admire her spirit
and courage.''
   ``The credit belongs to the grandma,'' said Dr. Jim Hillman, one
of the boy's doctors.
   While visiting relatives in Vero Beach in November 1986, the boy
darted into traffic and was hit by a car. His injury is called a
``hangman's fracture'' because that is where a noose hits in a
hanging. The fracture was in an area of the spinal cord that
controls breathing.
   He spent two months in a coma in a Vero Beach hospital, then was
transferred to a Tampa hospital where he underwent six operations
in seven months. He then went to a spinal cord center in Atlanta
for six months.
   ``A lot of people had written him off,'' said Peggy Berger,
director of nurses at West Shore Hospital where Gordon later went
for treatment. ``His grandmother said, `No, you're not going to put
him aside' ... she was right.''
   Mrs. Anderson said she talked to Gordon about taking him off the
ventilator. He couldn't say anything, but she said he indicated he
wanted to try.
   On the first try, she took the air supply away for five minutes.
His diaphragm, the muscle that moves the lungs up and down, had
atrophied from disuse but strengthened as she increased the time
off the machine each day.
   In two months, when the boy could be off the ventilator an hour
and a half a day, Mrs. Anderson told doctors and social workers
what she had done.
   ``Everybody was in shock. They said, `He can't breathe on his
own.' I said, `Come over and see for yourselves.'''
   To help his recovery, doctors sent Gordon to West Shore
Hospital, which specializes in the rehabilitation of patients on
ventilators. After five months, he can breathe on his own long
enough to make it through a school day.
   Mrs. Anderson is appealing for donations to pay for a van to
carry Gordon to school in Hillsborough County, where officials say
he will be the school system's first student to need the assistance
of a ventilator.

   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said Friday that
carrying out some of the economic reforms agreed to in Washington
talks with the United States will be painful, but could ultimately
improve the lives of the Japanese.
   At a news conference, Kaifu called the reforms a duty that
``Japan must discharge as a responsible member of the international
community.''
   He said the reforms would benefit not only the United States and
Japan, ``but also the whole world, serve to prevent the rise of
protectionism and thus contribute to the steady development of the
world economy.''
   ``I ask for the understanding and cooperation of the people of
my country,'' Kaifu said.
   On Japan's promise to revise laws protecting small retailers,
Kaifu told reporters the situation was ``severe,'' but added, ``I
believe it is important for me and all of you to think of the
viewpoint of consumers' interests.''
   Influential associations of small shopkeepers have resisted
changes that would make it easier to open new large-scale retail
stores, both Japanese and foreign, a process that now can take 10
years. The United States contends larger stores are more likely to
sell foreign products.
   ``The Japanese measures included in the interim report (on
U.S.-Japan negotiations) have been attained after undergoing a
difficult domestic process, and their implementation may, in some
cases, be painful,'' Kaifu said. ``It is my conviction, however,
that they are essential in furthering Japan's own national
interest.''
   ``The interim report reflects the maximum measures that our
country can take at this point. We will make the whole picture
clearer in the final report,'' due in July.
   Kaifu said Japan also should express its opinions more openly.
   ``I think we have exchanged frank opinions with the U.S.
negotiators. That is a way in which Japan can contribute to the
rest of the world.''
   Japan said the United States contributed to its $49 billion
trade imbalance with the Japanese because of its large budget
deficit, low savings rate, short-term corporate planning and
relatively weak education system. U.S. negotiators promised efforts
to remedy these problems.
   U.S. officials have also argued the changes sought in Japanese
business practices would benefit Japanese consumers, who pay some
of the world's highest prices as a result of a complex distribution
system and a web of government restrictions.
   Some Japanese commentators have berated their government for
relying on U.S. and other outside pressure to make reforms it is
too weak to push through on its own.
   They also say such reforms could strengthen Japan's economy in
ways that would make it an even more formidable international
competitor.
   Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama said Friday, ``Against the
background of the serious large-scale trade imbalance, the present
Japan-U.S. economic relations, unless managed properly, are in
danger of suffering grave damage, posing a threat of undermining
the mutual trust which lies at the foundation of the overall
relationship between the two nations.''
   He said the reforms have ``significant bearings upon the
improvement of the quality of life and the advancement of consumer
interests in Japan.''
   Among Japan's pledges was one to spend more on public works such
as housing, sewers, parks, airports and port facilities.
   The United States, counting on such spending to boost Japan's
demand for foreign goods and services, had sought a definite
spending target, but Japan said it would decide yearly expenditures
flexibly to avoid overheating the local economy.

   U.S. and Japanese negotiators on Thursday
announced completion of an unprecedented agreement pledging to
reduce trade frictions by making broad-based reforms in the
economies of both countries.
   The agreement, reached after four days of marathon discussions,
set forth a complex set of proposals aimed at lowering America's
huge $49 billion deficit with Japan by attacking structural
barriers to trade.
   Under Secretary of State Richard McCormack, the leader of the
U.S. negotiating team, said the talks had produced ``substantive
progress'' in resolving trade differences between the two economic
superpowers.
   A White House statement praised the agreement as ``an important
way station along the road leading to a strengthened U.S.-Japan
relationship.''
   In Tokyo, Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said carrying
out some of the deep economic reforms promised in the talks could
be painful, but in the end would improve the lives of the Japanese.
   Speaking at a news conference, Kaifu called the reforms a duty
that ``Japan must discharge as a responsible member of the
international community.''
   ``I ask for the understanding and cooperation of the people of
my country,'' Kaifu said.
   The talks were unprecedented in their scope because they aimed
not at boosting sales for specific foreign products but at
correcting broad barriers to trade in both countries.
   For the first time, representatives of sovereign states drew up
detailed lists of the economic shortcomings in the other nation and
demanded changes.
   Japanese critics of the effort complained that the United States
was trying to scrap centuries of Japanese tradition and remake the
country into the image of the United States.
   The Bush administration insisted that its recommendations would
benefit Japan by increasing competition in a country where
consumers now pay some of the highest prices in the industrial
world.
   The Japanese had their own list of complaints against the United
States, citing America's huge budget deficit, low savings rate and
short-term planning by U.S. companies as restraints on U.S.
productivity.
   The administration chose not to accept the most politically
sensitive Japanese recommendations to limit Americans' use of
credit cards, boost gasoline taxes and scrap tax deductions for
home mortgages.
   Instead, the administration pledged to increase efforts to
improve America's education system and pointed to proposals the
White House already is pushing to cut the federal budget deficit
and to provide tax credits for increased personal savings.
   The 22-page U.S. section of the report primarily recycled
previous administration proposals including its effort to get
Congress to enact a cut in the capital gains tax as a way of
fostering investment.
   However, the 32-page Japanese section contained a number of
sweeping proposals to revamp how businesses is conducted in Japan.
   Among the pledges made by the Japanese:
   _To deregulate Japan's complex goods-distribution system,
including a gradual relaxation of restrictions on the establishment
of large retail stores. Such a move would allow U.S. and other
foreign retailers to open outlets in Japan.
   _To increase enforcement of antitrust laws with tougher
penalties to discourage bid-rigging and other collusive practices
by Japanese corporations.
   _To boost government spending on public works projects, thus
expanding the volume of work on which American firms could bid.
   The talks on broad barriers to trade, known as the Structural
Impediments Initiative, were launched by the administration in
July. Until this week, they had made little headway.
   But Kaifu, seeking to lessen growing anti-Japanese sentiment in
Congress, promised Bush at a summit meeting in early March that he
would make lowering trade tensions a top priority for his
government.
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont. and chairman of a Senate trade
subcommittee, said he was impressed with the newfound willingness
by the Japanese to make concessions but he and other members of
Congress said it was critical for the Japanese words to be followed
by action.
   ``I am encouraged that some first steps have been taken on the
Structural Impediments Initiative. But these are only first
steps,'' Baucus said. ``Much remains to be done.''
   Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., said he was concerned because there
was no enforcement mechanism to make sure Japan lives up to its
commitments. ``In any commercial agreement with Japan, seeing is
believing,'' he said.
   Senate Finance Committee chairman, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas,
said he was not yet convinced that Japan was willing to ``put an
end to its longstanding protectionist practices.''
   ``Put me down as a skeptic who has seen too many agreements in
which the results didn't match the rhetoric,'' he said in a
statement. ``U.S.-Japan trade agreements _ and we had a lot of them
throughout the 1980s _ were like nothing so much as a drugstore
cowboy: all hat and no cattle.''
   Since the Bush-Kaifu meeting, there has been a flurry of
activity in trade negotiations. Agreement were announced in the
last two weeks to expand the opportunity for sales of American-made
telecommunications equipment, satellites and supercomputers in
Japan.
   Some saw the concessions as an attempt by Japan to keep from
being put on a ``hit list'' of the countries with the worst
barriers to trade for the second year in a row. The administration
faces a congressional deadline of April 30 for releasing a new list
of target countries.

   A bomb exploded in a bus Thursday at
Panipat town outside Punjab, killing 10 people, United News of
India reported.
   No immediate indication emerged as to who was responsible, but
the bus began its run in Haryana state near the Punjab border. Sikh
separatists have killed more than 540 people so far this year in
Punjab.
   In Parliament, a bill calling for a six-month extension of
federal rule in Punjab was passed in the Lok Sabha, or House of the
People, the lower house.
   The government-sponsored bill must also be approved in the Rajya
Sabha, or Council of States, the upper house, to become law but
approval is a formality because all parties have expressed their
support.
   Punjab was placed under federal administration in May 1987.
   On Tuesday, at least 29 people died when a bomb blamed on Sikh
extremists exploded as Hindus were parading through a crowded
vegetable market in the Punjab town of Batala to celebrate the
birthday of the Hindu warrior-god Rama.
   Police said at least three more people were killed by Hindus who
rioted after that bombing.
   The UNI news agency said Sikh extremists on Wednesday shot and
killed three state policemen returning from the funeral of a
constable who died in the Batala bombing. It said six other
policemen and several relatives of the constable were wounded in
the attack near Tetherke.
   Batala, a predominantly Hindu town, has been a frequent target
of Sikh militants who want to establish a separate nation for their
religious sect in the prosperous northern farming state of Punjab.

   A strong earthquake
shook a section of the Marianas Islands on Friday and rattled
windows 200 miles away, authorities said. There were no reports of
injury or serious damage.
   The quake occurred at 7:15 a.m. (5:15 p.m. Thursday EDT) and
registered 7.4 on the Richter scale, according to Bruce Presgrave,
a spokesman for the National Earthquake Information Service in
Golden, Colo.
   The epicenter was 138 miles northeast of Saipan near the island
of Anatahan in the western Pacific.
   ``A reading of 7.4 would make it a major earthquake, but the
only information we have is that it was felt on Guam,'' Presgrave
said. ``We've had no reports of damage at all.''
   ``We felt it for about 10 seconds; everything shook,'' said
Andrew Mazella, program director at radio station KSAI in Saipan.
The quake rattled windows and dishes in Guam, 220 miles southwest
of the epicenter.
   The quake slammed a 15-foot wave into Tinian, a tiny island
south of Saipan and pushed 5 feet of water into houses on Tanapag,
a village on Saipan island, said Felix Sasamoto, civil defense
coordinator for the islands.
   Some moorings broke loose in Tinian but no other damage was
reported, Sasamoto said.
   On Tuesday, all 21 residents of Anatahan, closest to the
epicenter, abandoned the island after a volcano there showed signs
of erupting.
   A Navy crew from Guam was checking the volcano Friday, but
geologists said the quake and volcanic activity apparently were
unrelated.
   ``This is different from the volcanic activity that has been
occurring in the islands,'' said Presgrave.
   Anatahan and Saipan are part of the Northern Marianas chain just
north of Guam, about 1,500 miles east of the Philippines.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 6 on the Richter scale can cause severe damage
in the local area. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable
of widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.
   The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the
Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the Richter
scale.

   Authorities staged all-day rallies in Tiananmen
Square on Thursday, China's annual day for mourning the dead,
preventing unofficial visits to the symbolic center of last year's
crushed democracy movement.
   It was the second time in a week city officials held official
activities in the square as an excuse for closing it to the public.
   The method appeared successful. There were no reports of
attempts to lay wreaths near the square or otherwise honor the
hundreds and possibly thousands of people killed June 3-4, when the
army opened fire on pro-democracy protesters and retook the square
where they had camped.
   Authorities reopened Tiananmen Square without fanfare on Friday,
with police standing guard or strolling around, continuing a heavy
presence in the area.
   In Hong Kong, however, an estimated 20,000 people marched in
honor of the Beijing dead, many carrying banners or bouquets of
flowers.
   A wreath was left from Chai Ling, a leading activist in the
Beijing uprising who escaped to the West last week after 10 months
on the run in China. ``Patriotic heroes will live forever,'' read a
banner on the wreath.
   Thursday was China's annual Qingming, or Clear and Bright
Festival, when families traditionally visit graves to mourn their
dead. Chinese dissidents abroad, through faxes and mailed leaflets,
urged Beijing residents to stroll through Tiananmen Square on
Qingming in memory of the slain protesters.
   Early in the week, however, Beijing authorities issued orders
curbing even normal mourning activities, such as group visits to
crematoriums.
   The Beijing Daily newspaper published a letter Sunday from a
city official warning residents to pass Qingming in a ``civilized
and healthy'' way and not ``take advantage of the opportunity to
create distubances.''
   Schools and factories told people to not to wear traditional
signs of mourning, such as black armbands or white flowers. Some
colleges suddenly announced special, mandatory political lectures,
apparently in an effort to keep students occupied.
   Authorities bused thousands of high school-age Communist Youth
League members into Tiananmen Square in the morning. They paid
homage to China's revolutionary martyrs and listened to a lecture
on China's past struggles against foreign imperialists.
   In the afternoon, primary school members of the Young Pioneers,
wearing their insignia red handkerchiefs around their necks,
marched onto the square in formation to hear more patriotic
speeches. Both the Youth League and the Young Pioneers try to
foster Marxism among young people.
   Members of the People's Armed Police, a paramilitary unit, stood
guard on the square's perimeter. Dozens of ordinary police
patrolled adjoining streets, making sure members of the public did
not try to enter. They yelled at foreigners who tried to photograph
the ceremonies.
   The city also held official rallies in the square Sunday,
another day when overseas dissidents suggested Beijing residents
hold protest strolls there.
   The next three months include many other dates when memorials or
protests might seem apt. April 15 is the one-year anniversary of
the death of ousted Communist Party leader Hu Yaobang, a relative
liberal. It was his death that first caused Beijing college
students to take to the streets, initiating seven weeks of marches
for democratic reform.
   Beijing college campuses were quiet Thursday. Regular campus
security guards checked identification at the gates of Beijing and
Qinghua universities, but no other uniformed police were visible.
   Students played tennis and volleyball in the warm spring
sunshine. None was willing to talk about last year's protests.
   ``The mood is tense ... But everyone agrees it won't be possible
to try for political change until after (senior leader) Deng
Xiaoping dies,'' said a teacher, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The 85-year-old Deng led China out of its radical leftist
Cultural Revolution and introduced market-style economic reforms.
But he approved last year's violent crackdown on political dissent
and insists China cannot develop its backward economy unless the
Communist Party maintains tight political control.
   The Hong Kong protesters chanted ``Don't forget June 4!'' and
``Democracy will win!'' as they marched through the British colony,
which will revert to Chinese rule in 1997.
   Wearing yellow headbands, the crowd laid wreaths at a makeshift
monument set up at a downtown park. A book of condolence was also
placed there for the people to sign their names.
   The signatures will be burned during a candlelight vigil June 4.

<TEXT>
   Former Secretary of State Cyrus Vance will
head a mission to Poland next month to help set up a stock market
and other free-market institutions, the Bush administration
announced Wednesday.
   Vance, who served under former President Jimmy Carter, and John
Whitehead, who was deputy secretary of state in the Reagan
administration, will chair a committee that will send American
volunteers to Eastern Europe to help with economic changes in
countries moving away from communist systems.
   Missions will go later to Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia
and other Eastern European countries, the U.S. Agency for
International Development (AID) said in a statement. Jerry Lipson,
a spokesman for the agency, said he knew of no plan to go to the
Soviet Union.
   ``This practical initiative offers a unique opportunity to
provide at the working level assistance to Eastern European nations
which have chosen democracy and free-market economic systems for
their future,'' the announcement quoted Vance as saying.
   He is now the presiding partner in the New York law firm of
Simpson, Thacher and Bartlett.
   The agency said his mission will consist of two teams. One will
focus on setting up financial markets. Fledgling stock markets

discussions on setting one up in Poland.

   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev will meet for a superpower summit in the United States
beginning May 30, U.S. and Soviet officials said Thursday as the
two sides broke new ground on Germany and on the Middle East.
   Accepting the principle of unifying East and West Germany, the
Soviets edged away from their demand that the merged country be
neutralized, U.S. and Soviet officials reported at the end of a
long day of bargaining on tough regional issues.
   And, in another potential breakthrough, the Soviets said they
would consider restoring diplomatic relations with Israel and
permitting the direct flight of Jews to Tel Aviv if they had
assurances the refugees would not be settled on the West Bank and
in East Jerusalem.
   Earlier, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said several
major agreements could emerge at the summit, including a
long-sought Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty to limit long-range
nuclear weapons.
   But Bush said merely that the summit would provide ``time for a
lot of dialogue and a lot of discussion.''
   Officials on both sides acknowledged that in the more than seven
weeks remaining it would be difficult to forge agreements across
the board of U.S.-Soviet relations.
   But a group of U.S. and Soviet regional experts, working at the
direction of Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, achieved surprising
progress on Germany, the Middle East and also the wars in Angola
and Afghanistan.
   The Soviets insisted, as they have in the past, that the pace of
merging East and West Germany is too fast. However, a U.S. official
told reporters, ``we also got the impression a neutral Germany is
not the only answer to security questions there.''
   Confirming the development, a Soviet official briefing
separately said ``we think neutrality may be the answer, but we
invite people to supply us with other ideas.''
   He said Moscow's aim was simply that a unified Germany should
``be no danger to its neighbors.''
   In the Middle East, the Soviets continued their attack on Israel
for settling Jews on the West Bank and in East Jerusalem, territory
that the Arabs held until the 1967 Six-Day War.
   However, the Soviet offer to resume relations with Israel, which
were suspended in 1967, and to open direct flights of refugees to
Tel Aviv provided they do not settle in the disputed lands ``was a
different kind of response than we heard before,'' a U.S. official
said.
   The briefings, held for reporters in a State Department
auditorium, were conducted under rules that prohibited identifying
the officials further.
   On two other troubled fronts, Angola and Afghanistan, the U.S.
officials said the Soviets had shown an interest in elections as a
way of ending wars in the countries between forces backed by the
two superpowers. to limit long-range nuclear weapons.
   Earlier, Soviet negotiator Yuri Nazarkin said of the possibility
of signing a U.S.-Soviet pact on long-range nuclear weapons,
``Taking into account (the summit is) in seven weeks, it's
impractical, I think, to expect it (the treaty) is going to be
signed at the summit.''
   Fitzwater said the summit _ Bush's second meeting as president
with the Soviet leader _ would be a ``tough love'' encounter, with
the crisis in Lithuania a central topic.
   Bush and Gorbachev last met early in December in a storm-tossed
shipboard summit at the Mediterranean island of Malta. Since then,
pushes for independence in Lithuania and other regions of the
Soviet Union _ and the Soviet response to them _ have strained
superpower relations.
   Simultaneous announcements of the summit came from the White
House and the Soviet news agency Tass early Thursday as Baker and
Shevardnadze were holding their second day of meetings on arms
control and other issues.
   ``There's still a lot of work to do, particularly in light of
the fact that the summit will begin on the 30th,'' Baker told
reporters. ``So we have our work cut out for us.''
   Shevardnadze, who will meet with Bush on Friday, echoed Baker's
remarks. ``There is very little time, only seven weeks,'' he said.
   Both the Washington and Moscow announcements gave the summit
dates as May 30 to June 3.
   However, Fitzwater said all five days might not be used. ``It
could turn out to be a two or three-day summit, depending on travel
schedules,'' he suggested.
   U.S. officials were also vague on whether the meeting would take
place entirely in Washington, or at some other location as well _
such as the president's oceanside home in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   Fitzwater said that the crisis in Lithuania would ``undoubtedly
be an issue'' at the summit and that the president intended to
raise it. ``If anything, Lithuania makes the summit even more
important,'' the spokesman said.
   ``I would characterize this summit more in terms of
demonstrating the kind of tough-love working relationship that we
were able to develop with the Soviet Union by virtue of four or
five summits,'' he said.
   Gennadi Gerasimov, the Soviet spokesman, indicated that Baker
had energetically raised U.S. concerns about the use of Soviet
force in the breakaway Baltic state in his sessions with
Shevardnadze. ``There was a serious, hardball exchange of opinions
on this subject,'' Gerasimov told reporters.
   Senate leaders who met with Shevardnadze Wednesday night said he
told them Gorbachev faced heavy pressure at home, including
criticism for not being tougher on Lithuania.
   Fitzwater said that trade with the Soviet Union also would be
discussed at the summit, possibly including conditions under which
the United States might lift the Jackson-Vanik trade sanctions in
place since the mid 1970s to protest Moscow's restrictions on
emigration of Soviet Jews.
   Gorbachev is seeking access to Western credit and improved trade
relations.
   Bush and Gorbachev might also set final terms for reducing U.S.
and Soviet troops, tanks and other conventional forces in Europe,
Fitzwater suggested. But a treaty would be finalized at a 35-nation
summit meeting later in the year.
   The two leaders also might initial an agreement for a phased
reduction of American and Soviet chemical weapons, Fitzwater
suggested. An international ban depends on agreement among more
than a score of nations negotiating terms in Geneva.

   A former officer of the Philippines
government-owned bank testified Thursday that examiners threatened
to close the bank in 1982 if millions of dollars withdrawn by
Imelda Marcos were not replenished.
   Oscar Carino, vice president of the New York branch of the
Philippine National Bank until 1984, testified that the bank
provided the former Philippine first lady with an average of
$100,000 in cash every time she visited New York.
   He said the debit at the bank prosecutors contend Mrs. Marcos
used as her personal ``piggy bank'' climbed from $500,000 in 1973
to as much as $22 million in 1984.
   State examiners threatened to close the bank, he said.
   Instructions for the withdrawals came from Mrs. Marcos' private
secretary, Fe Roa Jimenez, Carino said.
   Carino earlier testified that he met with Philippines president
Ferdinand Marcos at the Malacanang Palace in Manila before he took
the job in 1973.
   When he asked the leader for any special instructions, Carino
quoted the late Marcos as saying, ```You go there. You will be
hearing from us.'''
   Carino said he then met with former bank president Roberto S.
Benedicto, a Marcos associate, during a stopover in Las Vegas on
his way to New York.
   ``He told me he would be sending us instructions and warned me
against the auditor not being very good about keeping confidential
transactions under wrap,'' Carino said.
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, is charged with racketeering, conspiracy, mail
fraud and obstruction for allegedly embezzling more than $160
million from the Philippine treasury to buy New York real estate
and artworks.
   Her co-defendant, Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi, is charged
with mail fraud and obstruction for allegedly backdating documents
to help the Marcoses hide their ownership of four Manhattan
buildings.
   Marcos also was charged in the 1988 indictment but died in exile
in Hawaii last September. Benedicto is one of five fugitives named
in the indictment.
   In earlier testimony, the curator of a private art collection
purchased by Mrs. Marcos in 1981 said he found many of its valuable
items in ``horrible condition'' during a search of her daughter's
home seven years later.
   Morton J. Bernstein then surprised her attorney by testifying
under cross-examination that he held the former Philippines first
lady personally responsible for the damage.
   Bernstein testified that he had served for two decades as
manager of the art and antiques collection owned by the late
philanthropist Leslie R. Samuels, and could identify every one of
its paintings, figurines, 17th and 18th century furniture pieces
and other items.
   Bernstein testified that later, the FBI asked him to go to
California to identify Samuels collection items found at the small
estate of Mrs. Marcos' younger daughter, Irene Araneta.
   Bernstein said he found the items in ``horrible condition,''
with priceless pieces of furniture stacked in a damp, dirt-floored
barn. He said mirrors were cracked, tables damaged, and some
statues had fingers broken off.
   ``It was heartbreaking,'' he said.
   ``But you are not blaming Mrs. Marcos, are you?'' asked Gerald
Spence, Mrs. Marcos' attorney.
   Bernstein paused, then replied, ``Yes, I do.''
   Spence, visibly taken aback, asked why.
   ``Somebody had to supervise it _ whose fault was it?'' Bernstein
replied.

<TEXT>
   East Germany's first freely chosen Parliament
declared the nation a democracy on Thursday and began building a
political system that will lead it to unification with West Germany.
   The lawmakers, elected March 18 in the nation's first democratic
ballot, convened for the first time and formally dismantled the
Communist system that ruled four decades.
   Meeting in the Palace of the Republic built by the former
Stalinist regime, the 400-member Parliament began rewriting the
constitution to mirror that of West Germany.
   The new legislature and the government it creates could be East
Germany's last as a sovereign state because of the moves toward
unification with West Germany.
   The Parliament empowered Christian Democrat leader Lothar de
Maiziere, whose party holds the most seats in Parliament, to build
a new government from the 11 parties represented in the legislature.
   Dr. Sabine Bergmann-Pohl, a Christian Democrat, was elected
president of Parliament and urged that lawmakers ``do justice to
our responsibilities and that we soon sit in a common German
Parliament.''
   Bergmann-Pohl said legislators must work with their West German
counterparts to merge the nations and bring the capital of a single
Germany back to a united Berlin.
   Some heartening news also came from Washington late Thursday.
U.S. and Soviet officials who are bargaining on regional isssues
there said the Soviets, accepting the principle of unifying the two
Germanys, edged away from their demand that the merged country be
neutralized.
   A Soviet official told a briefing, ``We think neutrality may be
the answer, but we invite people to supply us with other ideas.''
   Thursday's gathering at the Palace of the Republic was rich in
symbolism and was the culmination of the revolt that toppled the
former Communist regime in October. But the shape of de Maiziere's
government and the pace of reunification will likely be worked out
in backroom negotiations.
   ``Forty years of difficult times have ended in this moment,''
said Lothar Piche, 63, the oldest member of Parliament. ``God
support our German fatherland.''
   The first thing the 390 lawmakers in attendance did was elect
Bergmann-Polh to be Parliament's president.
   Others seeking the post were outgoing Communist Premier Hans
Modrow, who leads a rebuilt pro-democracy party that finished a
distant third in the March elections. He finished third in the
voting for Parliament president, behind Social Democrat Reinhard
Hoeppner.
   The Parliament also created an office of president to be a
ceremonial head of state and abolished the old Communist collective
body, the Council of State.
   Bergmann-Pohl will serve as head of state until a president is
elected by Parliament.
   De Maiziere will likely be the premier, or prime minister, and
will lead talks in the coming days on forming a new Cabinet.
   If de Maiziere is successful in bringing together the disparate
political groups, Parliament will then reconvene April 11 and vote
on his Cabinet nominations.
   De Maiziere leads an alliance of three parties that has been
trying to form a coalition with the more left-leaning Social
Democrats and a smaller group of liberal lawmakers.
   His Alliance for Germany won the most seats in the March 18
elections, campaigning on the need for fast unification with West
Germany. But it needs a broad coalition to ensure the two-thirds
vote necessary in Parliament to enact constitutional changes
required for unification.
   While the Alliance favors quick reunification with West Germany,
the Social Democrats support a slower pace.
   Despite their differences, the East German parties are united in
their opposition to a proposal regarding the establishment of a
single currency for East and West Germany.
   The West German central bank wants to trade East marks for West
marks at a 2-1 exchange rate. East Germany is demanding a 1-1
exchange to help offset widespread uneployment and rising costs
once the nations are merged.
   Thousands protested the 2-1 proposal in the East German cities
of Halle, Neubrandenburg, Magdeburg, Dresden, Gera and Cottbus on
Thursday, the government news agency ADN reported.
   About 50,000 people rallied in Leipzig, where mass protests
against the old Communist government began last fall. ADN said the
Leipzig protesters were demanding that West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl live up to promises of prosperity for East Germans.
   Kohl campaigned hard on de Maiziere's behalf and promised that
East Germans would be protected as unification proceeded.
   East Germany's many inefficient and obsolete industries are
having difficulty competing with the flood of Western products
already available to East Germans. According to ADN, 40,000 East
Germans lost their jobs in March.
   West Germany said Thursday it is pressing ahead with its plans
for making the West German mark the East German currency by summer.
   In Bonn, Finance Minister Theo Waigel told reporters government
ministers are examining a 50-page draft proposal for replacing East
Germany's nearly worthless currency. Waigel said the recommendation
for a 2-to-1 conversion rate was not discussed by the ministers
Thursday.

   A federal judge ruled Thursday that the
city's program for giving minority-owned businesses preferred
status is unconstitutional.
   The so-called ``set-aside'' program called for at least 15
percent of budgeted city contracts were go to minority-owned
businesses and 10 percent to female-owned businesses.
   Businesses in which minorities or women held at least 51 percent
ownership also were eligible for set-aside contracts.
   A coalition of contractors sued in 1989, contending that the
program discriminated against them because of their non-minority
status.
   U.S. District Judge Louis C. Bechtle's order permanently enjoins
the set-aside program. He said it violates the Fourteenth Amendment
of the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees the rights of citizens.
   City Solictor Charisse R. Lillie said the city would appeal and
is asking for a stay.
   Philadelphia contracting firm owner Barbera Bushing said, ``I
think that's really too bad. The male-owned businesses really don't
care about hiring women.
   ``It's already hard for women to get into it. This decision
makes it even tougher,'' she added.
   John H. Widman, an attorney for the contractors, said he did not
think minority firms would be hurt by the decision.
   ``Now we can focus on what contracting is all about and that is
skills, price, and expericence.'' Widman said.
   Mayor W. Wilson Goode has praised the program, which was
established in 1982 under former Mayor William J. Green.
   Bechtle said he based his decision on a 1989 U.S. Supreme Court
ruling that threw out Richmond, Va.'s program of setting aside 30
percent of city construction contracts for minority-owned
businesses.
   The Supreme Court ruled that past discrimination would have to
be well documented before a program could constitutionally be
enacted to correct discrimination. They ruled that discrimination
did not exist simply because 50 percent of the Richmond population
was black and only two-thirds of 1 percent of the contracts went to
black-owned business.
   Philadelphia's minority set-aside program was aimed at
correcting a ``pattern of past and present racial, sexual and
economic discrimination,'' according to the ordinance's preamble.

   Armored vehicles rolled into Michoacan state
as opposition supporters were ousted Thursday from city halls they
had shut down in December to dramatize election fraud charges
against Mexico's ruling party.
   Demonstrators from the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) were
dislodged from 14 of the 17 city halls closed since the disputed
December municipal elections, according to news reports Thursday
evening. At least 80 people were arrested but there was no
violence, the reports said.
   The army refused to acknowledge the controversial operation in
the rugged farming state known as a PRD stronghold.
   ``We don't have any information on this. Absolutely nothing,''
said Second Lt. Jimenez, a Defense Department spokeswoman in Mexico
City who declined to give her first name.
   A presidential spokesman who demanded anonymity said state
judicial police had dislodged the demonstrators. He said the army
did not take part.
   But the government news agency Notimex said military police had
``peacefully'' removed demonstrators, some of whom were armd, from
all but three of the city halls by Thursday evening. Notimex said
80 protesters had been arrested.
   Mexico's attorney general said there was no violence.
   ``There hasn't been even one blow nor one drop of blood,''
Attorney General Enrique Alvarez del Castillo was quoted as saying
by the private Televisa TV network from the state capital of
Morelia, 150 miles northwest of Mexico City.
   The PRD issued a statement saying there could be a ``bloodbath''
in Michoacan.
   Seven people died in February and in March in neighboring
Guerrero state during election fraud protests and the eviction by
police of PRD supporters from occupied city halls.
   The PRD says the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party or
PRI, which has ruled Mexico 61 years, cheated it out of victory in
the December elections in both states.
   Armored vehicles entered Michoacan Wednesday, according to
witnesses and news reports. The action came the same day the PRI
governor called on federal and state authorities to intervene if
the PRD did not relinquish the city halls.
   The fraud protests have brought Michoacan to the edge of
``anarchy,'' Gov. Jaime Genovevo Figueroa Zamudio said in a letter
published in Mexico City newspapers.
   The PRI invariably denies election fraud allegations and often
makes countercharges of violence against the opposition, especially
the leftist PRD.
   The question of whether the opposition gets a fair shake at
Mexico's polls remains unresolved. Mexico, unlike Panama under
strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega or Nicaragua under the leftist
Sandinistas, does not permit international election observers.
   Television news aired film of military vehicles rumbling through
the streets of Morelia. Five armored vehicles began patrolling
Ciudad Hidalgo, 110 miles northwest of Mexico City, on Wednesday,
said Hector Edmundo Tinajero Gonzales, editor of the local
newspaper El Clarion.
   He said he had similar accounts from Apatzingan.
   The official news agency Notimex said PRD sympathizers were
ousted at city halls in Apatzingan, Ciudad Hidalgo, Brisenas,
Chavinda, Huandacareo, Cotija and Jacona at midday Thursday.
   The government newspaper El Nacional announced the end of the
city hall occupations before it happened.
   It said PRD protesters voluntarily disbanded Wednesday at all 17
city halls after ``talks with army officials.'' The story said
nothing about army deployments.
   Army intervention in political disputes is as touchy a subject
for the Mexican government as vote fraud. Interior Minister
Fernando Gutierrez Barrios issued a statement Thursday saying the
``federal presence'' in Michoacan had been ``reinforced'' to avoid
violence on the part of the PRD.
   Michoacan has been a problem for the PRI since the 1988
presidential race, when native son and PRD founder Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas came in second to President Carlos Salinas de Gortari in
an election still clouded by allegations of vote fraud.
   Nearly half of Michoacan's 110 city halls were occupied by
Cardenas supporters after the national elections to protest alleged
vote fraud and demand the replacement of the PRI governor.
   In one of his first officials acts after taking office in
December 1988, Salinas replaced the governor. The move failed to
pacify the PRD.
   There was further occupations after the July 2 state elections
in which PRI claimed a majority in the state legislative races over
PRD fraud charges.

   A Juvenile Court judge on Wednesday refused to
allow an 11-year-old boy to visit the younger brother he was
separated from when their adoptive parents decided the older boy
hadn't ``bonded'' well with them.
   Juvenile Court Judge Arthur N. Hamilton transferred a lawsuit
asking that two boys be able to visit each other to the court's
chancery division, which he said was the more appropriate forum.
   Cook County Public Guardian Patrick Murphy, who brought the
lawsuit on behalf of the 11-year-old boy, argued that the judge
should act because the situation was an emergency.
   ``Rick wants to see his brother and he wants to see him now,''
Murphy said.
   Murphy told reporters later that the two boys have seen each
other just once since Rick went to the group home Nov. 20 just
before Thanksgiving.
   A lawsuit filed by Murphy last week charges that the adoptive
parents separated Rick _ not his real name _ and his 8-year-old
brother, whom they adopted in 1984. It seeks $50,000 in damages for
Rick. The lawsuit says the parents, called Joseph and Pamela Doe in
the lawsuit, returned him to state custody because he hadn't
``bonded'' well with them.
   Hamilton said he would not issue a ruling on the visitation
because Chancery Court handles injunctions. Hamilton said he also
thought it would be quicker if Murphy went back to the judge who
originally denied visitation to get that judge to change his ruling.
   Juvenile Court Judge Walter Williams on March 9 approved the
parents' petition to surrender their parental rights to Rick and
ruled at that time there would be no visitation.
   Murphy said that while he pursues the injunction for visitation
in the chancery court he also would go back to Williams next week
and ask the judge to change his mind.
   Advocates for children say that the case is unusual because
damages are being sought from adoptive parents and the case
involves siblings who have been separated.
   Bill Pierce, president of the National Committee for Adoption in
Washington, D.C., called the case ``extremely rare.''
   Murphy said the lawsuit was unusual because parents usually
don't separate adopted chidlren.
   ``It's every little boy's nightmare,'' Murphy said after filing
the lawsuit. ``Rick's parents told him they were going to put him
into an orphange and they did it. It's like telling a kid you're
going to send the bogey man after him and then doing it.''
   Murphy said the boy, who is in a foster home, blames himself.
   The parents' attorney, Mary C. Martin, did not comment after the
hearing.

   Three inmates were injured at the San Sebastian Prison on the
south side of the capital, said Red Cross spokesman Jorge Arroyo.
He gave no further details.
   About 150 San Sebastian inmates took over a building, set fire

he said.
   A riot at the Women's Prison a short while later was quelled

<HEAD>Rock Hudson's Ex-Lover Files $22 Million Libel Suit Over Depiction
in Book</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rock Hudson's ex-lover claimed Wednesday in a
$22 million libel lawsuit that he was maliciously portrayed as a
psychotic criminal by the authors of a book about the late actor.
   Marc Christian, who won $5.5 million from the Hudson estate a
year ago in a landmark AIDS lawsuit, said in a Superior Court
lawsuit filed by celebrity lawyer Marvin Mitchelson that he was
shamed by the book's depiction of him.
   The Tom Clark and Dick Kleiner book ``Rock Hudson, Friend of
Mine,'' released last month, referred to Christian as ``a criminal,
a thief, an unclean person, a blackmailer, a psychotic, an
extortionist, a forger, a perjurer, a liar, a whore, an arsonist
and a squatter,'' the lawsuit said.
   Mitchelson said the portrayal was false and that Christian was
asking $11 million in general damages and $11 million in punitive
damages for a loss of ``his reputation, shame and mortification.''
   ``He's just not going to sit still for it,'' Mitchelson said.
``We asked them to take out all the passages we felt were libelous
and they didn't take them out.''
   In addition to Clark and Kleiner, the lawsuit names New
York-based Pharos Books as defendants. Martha Clark, a spokeswoman
for the publisher, did not return a phone call seeking comment.
   ``The written statements are libelous on their face because
Christian is charged with improper and immoral conduct,''
Mitchelson said. ``They aren't backed up by any facts at all.
   ``The most scurrilous one of all was that Marc knew Hudson had
AIDS at the time Hudson learned he had it,'' the attorney said.
``It says he might have known it before Hudson knew.''
   That issue was prominent in Christian's suit against the Hudson
estate.
   A jury ruled in February 1989 that Hudson was guilty of
``outrageous conduct'' for concealing his AIDS diagnosis from
Christian, his lover for two years. Christian said he didn't learn
of the actor's illness until a few months before Hudson, 58, died
on Oct. 5, 1985.
   ``I thought I was a dead man,'' Christian testified about the
terror that gripped him in the wake of the disclosure.
   Although Christian didn't contract AIDS and has tested negative
for the presence of the virus, the judge and the jury found he
deserved damages. It was a unique ruling in personal injury law on
sexually transmitted diseases.
   The jury ruled Christian should get $21.5 million, but Superior
Court Judge Bruce Geernaert ruled the amount excessive, deciding
last April that it should be whittled down to $5.5 million.
   Mitchelson said Christian has received $600,000 so far, but the
rest was tied up in appeals by the Hudson estate. He expects an
appellate court decision by the end of the year.

<HEAD>Cabinet Approves Plans for Massive Power Cuts, Four-Day Work Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN GUERRERO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Cabinet on Wednesday ordered a
four-day work week for government employees and approved major
electricity cutbacks in Manila to cope with a critical power
shortage.
   Under the plan, government offices will close on five
consecutive Mondays starting April 23. The government urged major
private companies to close on those Mondays and said electricity to
large commercial users would be shut off during those days.
   Factories will lose power for four hours one day each week, the
government said. Residential districts will continue to have daily
power cuts of up to four hours.
   The state-run National Power Corp. (NPC), which generates
electricity for sale to distributors, said the cutbacks were
necessary because of power plant repairs and a drought that has
reduced water levels at hydroelectric stations.
   ``The situation clearly calls for some sacrifice from all
sectors,'' the government said in a statement. ``Realizing the
seriousness of the situation, business and industrial groups have
reached a consensus that power needs to be rationed on an equitable
manner based on essentiality.''
   NPC spokesman Alex Dizon said 12 of 22 power plants on Luzon,
the main Philippine island, were not operational.
   He said some were undergoing regular maintenance, others were
being repaired for damage sustained during a typhoon last year
while others could not operate because of low water levels at
hydroelectric stations.
   The 22 plants generate 2,982 megawatts, with at least 80 percent
consumed by the metropolitan Manila area.
   Metropolitan Manila, which has a population of about 8 million,
suffered frequent power outages last year until military dissidents
launched a nine-day coup attempt against the government of
President Corazon Aquino on Dec. 1.
   Rebels cited the power crisis as an example of alleged
government incompetence. Officials of the power corporation had
complained that they predicted the crisis as early as 1986 but that
Mrs. Aquino's government stalled on their request to invest in new
generating facilities.

<HEAD>Pilot Strike Cripples Nepal Flights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 100 pilots and crew members of
the state airline staged a one-day strike Wednesday, forcing
officials to cancel all domestic and international flights.
   The strike was to protest alleged human rights violations by the
government and to express support with an ongoing movement for
restoring multiparty democracy in the Himalayan kingdom.
   The Royal Nepal Airline Corp. pilots came to the airport wearing
uniforms and carrying placards that read: ``Pilots Against Human
Rights Violation.''
   Some flight attendants and a few technicians also joined the
strike, which was announced earlier this week.
   Government officials were not available for comment.
   ``We have cooperated with the government all along (but) now we
are protesting because of the deplorable situation in the country.
We want normalcy to return,'' said copies of handwritten statements
distributed by the pilots at the Tribhuvan Airport.
   ``We can't just sit down and watch the events in the country as
spectators,'' the unsigned statements said.
   The government says at least 16 people have been killed in
clashes between demonstrators and police after the democracy
movement was launched on Feb. 18.
   The movement leaders, the Nepali Congress Party and a coalition
of left-wing parties, demand restoration of multiparty system in
the non-partisan legislature called the Rashtriya Panchayat or the
national assembly.
   The government rejects the demands, saying its proponents are
trying to impose their system on a nation that already has a
working democracy.

   Federally mediated negotiations to end a
2-day-old strike by 11,000 hospital workers at the nation's largest
health maintenance organization recessed Wednesday with no progress
reported.
   Negotiators for striking hospital workers and Kaiser Permanente
agreed to resume their talks Thursday afternoon, said Tom Ramsay,
spokesman for Local 399 of the Service Employees International
Union.
   Both sides gathered at 1 p.m. Wednesday at the Federal Mediation
and Conciliation Service office, and met through the afternoon,
said Kaiser Permanente spokeswoman Mary McCaughey.
   The strike by technicians, maintenance workers and licensed
vocational nurses at the nation's oldest and largest HMO began at
midnight Monday.
   The walkout affects hospitals in Anaheim, Los Angeles, West Los
Angeles, Panorama City, Woodland Hills, Harbor City, and
Bellflower, and more than 40 satellite medical offices.
   Kaiser said it had reduced the number of patients to an average
of 47 percent of full occupancy at the seven affected hospitals.
Some of the medical offices were closed.
   A similar session supervised by federal officials ended Saturday
with no settlement, a day after the workers rejected a union
negotiating team's recommendation on a $44 million, three-year
contract offer.
   The company had guaranteed a 5 percent raise the first year and
3 percent raise the second and third years. Top pay for a licensed
vocational nurse under the old contract was $13.01 per hour,
according to Kaiser.
   Workers are demanding higher wages, but have not revealed their
demands in detail.
   The Pasadena-based HMO has more than 1.5 million members in Los
Angeles, Orange and Ventura counties, the areas affected by the
strike.
   Kaiser Permanente, like other HMOs, offers its members medical
care for a prepaid, fixed price, rather than on a pay-per-visit
basis. Its emergency services were unaffected, but some patients
had appointments postponed or moved to open clinics, officials said.

   About 1,000 people rallied Wednesday in
support of a museum threatened with obscenity charges because it
plans to exhibit sexually graphic photographs by the late Robert
Mapplethorpe.
   The demonstrators at the downtown rally one block from the
Contemporary Arts Center carried signs reading ``Censorship is
Obscene'' and ``Greetings from Censornati.''
   Police are investigating the six-week exhibit that opens Friday,
and have said they reserve the right to shut it down.
   Sheriff Simone Leis Jr., a vetern anti-smut campaigner, has said
nine of the 175 photographs in the show, depicting sadomasichistic
and homosexual sex acts and nude children, may be criminally
obscene.
   The controversy has produced an outpouring of support for the
exhibit, Arts Center officials said. More than 3,000 tickets have
been sold for the opening night.
   Margaret Landing, a secretary attending Wednesday's rally, said
it was her first protest.
   ``I wouldn't have gone (to the museum) before this,'' she said.
``But who are they to say what I can't see? Now, I'm going.''
   Art students from the University of Cincinnati carried a banner
reading ``If You Give Artists Freedom of Expression, Soon Every
American Will Want it.''
   The Arts Center sued local and county authorities last week,
seeking a jury verdict on whether the pictures violate community
obscenity standards. A judge has set the first hearing in the case
for Friday.
   Lawyers for the museum asked Wednesday for a judgment without
trial in the museum's favor. They said all of the exhibit is
constitutionally protected because it is legitimate art, and
submitted supporting affidavits from officials at other museums.
   Some people who have seen the pictures say they are shocking but
do not appeal to prurient interest. The Arts Center plans to run
the nine photographs in a separate room that minors will be
prohibited from entering.
   The Mapplethorpe pictures led Congress last year to limit
federal support for the arts after Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
labeled them obscene. They later were shown without incident in
Washington, D.C.; Philadelphia; Chicago; Boston; Hartford, Conn.,
and Berkeley, Calif.
   Mapplethorpe died of AIDS in March 1989.
   Leis has led community groups who closed all adult bookstores in
Cincinnati. Then a prosecutor, in 1977 Leis prosecuted publisher
Larry Flynt for pandering obscenity. Flynt was convicted, but a new
trial was ordered and charges were dropped in 1985.
   The director of the Arts Center's board of trustees resigned
last month because of pressures on his employer, a bank.

   Lithuania's secessionist government has accused
the Kremlin of backing forces bent on its overthrow, but also
appeared to improve the climate for formal talks by expressing a
willingness to make major concessions.
   ``The Soviet Union, with the aid of its army, supports a small
group of its political supporters which is attempting to restore
the old structures of the Soviet administration,'' Lithuania's
Parliament said in a statement Wednesday.
   ``There is therefore a threat to overthrow the legally elected
authority and the government,'' said the statement, broadcast on
Lithuanian radio.
   In London, however, the republic's de facto spokesman expressed
a willingness to agree to concessions including a continued Soviet
military presence, the retention of current economic ties with
Moscow and a referendum on independence.
   The announcement came from Algis Cekuolis, a foreign affairs
adviser to Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis, and was the
first such public offer from the Lithuanians.

   Scientists have arranged 35 atoms to create what
is probably the world's tiniest advertisement, attaining a

   It took 22 hours of moving atoms one by one to create the

   The design, about 660 billionths of an inch long, is featured in
a report by Eigler and Erhard Schweizer, who did the work at IBM's

   The fiery crash of a small plane may have
been caused by a struggle for control of the aircraft by a
passenger dying of brain cancer and bent on suicide, investigators
say.
   ``We thought we were investigating an air accident, and it has
turned into something else,'' police spokesman David Grimm said
Wednesday.
   The twin-engine plane plowed into a Boulder neighborhood Sunday,
setting a house and garages ablaze and killing pilot James Wilford
``Bill'' Layne, 56, of Aurora and his passenger, Gordon Larry Hood,
45, of Atlanta, authorities said.
   Grimm said out-of-state acquaintances of Hood's said he had

   ``Putting out a newspaper without promotion is
like winking at a girl in the dark _ well-intentioned but
ineffective,'' said press mogul William Randolph Hearst.
   His quotation adorns an exhibit, ``The American Journalist:
Paradox of the Press.'' It opens today at the Library of Congress
and winks, in full self-consciousness, at the American press in
every manifestation from feisty Hearst to feisty Benjamin Harris,
America's first newsman.
   Harris published the first American newspaper on Sept. 25, 1690.
It lasted one issue before it was closed down by the British
authorities. The sole surviving copy was flown back from London for
the exhibit.
   The show, underwritten by a $325,000 grant from the Gannett
Foundation and running through Aug. 12, coincides with the 67th
annual meeting of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, whose
members gathered at the library Wednesday night to celebrate the

   Latin American cocaine barons
stymied by Washington's war on drugs are relying more and more on
European ports to get their merchandise to U.S. streets, police say.
   Moreover, officials say, all across Europe police seizures of
cocaine have at least doubled in the past few years and the drug is
challenging heroin as the narcotic of choice on the continent.
   Last month, the National Police Intelligence Service published
figures that show cocaine seizures in the Netherlands to have risen
dramatically over the past three years.
   Dutch police confiscated 7,700 pounds of cocaine in the first
three months of this year alone _ more than double the 3,120 pounds
seized in all of last year and almost three times the 1,130 pounds
in 1988.

   Much lies behind the Tower of London's mustached
Beefeaters, cobblestone lanes and ravens, including the workshop of
Ted Smith and son, armorers, who preserve an ancient craft from
extinction.yal Armory craftsmen and five assistants restore and
conserve the 40,000 pieces of armor in the Tower collection.
   Smith, 62, will retire in 1992 and is passing on his knowledge
of makin
   The two Rog and repairing armor to his 26-year-old son, Christopher.
   Behind a bright red door, away from the crown jewels and the 2
million tourists who flock to the 900-year-old Tower each year, the
Smiths work together on a replica of a knight's fighting helmet
made in northern Italy in 1460.
   Their one concession to modernity is a propane torch. All other
materials and methods are authentic to the time.
   Medieval armorers used cumbersome coal forges. A propane torch
makes it easier to work on those awkward lance-rests and chanfrons.
   ``We had a small forge for awhile, but it blew up a couple of
times and, with a gallery directly above us, it wouldn't have been
practical,'' Ted Smith explained.
   For the rouns to disband the
assembly and have new elections.''
   Ibrahim Nafei, a Mubarak confidant and editor of the leading
newspaper Al-Ahram, expressed the government position: ``There can
be no invalidation of the People's Assembly.''
   The constitutional argument is part of a political tug-of-war
that began almost as soon as Mubarak took office.
   A major issue has been the regular extension of an emergency
enacted after Sadat was killed. It gives the executive branch wide
powers of arrest and search without warrant, and bans strikes and
demonstrations.
   Opposition parties want the law scrapped, but the government
says it is a vital tool against Moslem extremists. The latest
extension runs until spring 1991.
   Mubarak has not said whether he will disband the People's
Assembly. An aide, Mustafa el-Fiki, said the president ``will act
at the right time in the light of litigation,'' indicating he might
await the Constitutional Court ruling.
   The constitution gives a president the right to dissolve
parliament only with the electorate's approval in a referendum.
   In 1987, Mubarak called a referendum before the court upheld
Khalid's suit against parts of the election law. The voters
endorsed dissolution and elections two months later, in April.
   After the People's Assembly nominated Mubarak for a second
six-year term in October 1987, voters approved him in another
referendum.
   At the time, the political consensus that Mubarak dissolved
parliament quickly because the presidential nomination was nearly
at hand. This time, no such urgent business is pending.

<TEXT>
   Are you nostalgic for slipping through the blackout
to the alley door, savoring haute rutabaga and other joys of dining
out in Nazi-occupied Paris? Drop in at The Curfew.
   Le Couvre-Feu, as the ``living theater'' restaurant is known in
French, is near Montmartre and does not let diners in through the
blackened street door on Rue Philippe de Girard.
   A young man in knickers and visored cap whispers: ``Go around to
the back alley.''
   Inside, the ambience changes to what might be the set of a Jean
Renoir film _ zinc bar, photos of 1940s movie idols like Clark
Gable and Humphrey Bogart, red banquettes, old black telephones.
   Proprietors Lulu and Maurice, played by actors, rush forward to
ask if you've had any trouble getting there. A kir, or white-wine
cassis, appears on the bar.
   Lulu is Catherine de Ville, who wears a flowery period dress but
was born after the war. Edouard Bouzy, who plays Maurice, was born
in 1938 and remembers little of the war years, except that ``we
rarely had good food to eat.''
   They do a lively job of re-creating the Resistance atmosphere.
They take orders, shout at their ``children'' _ also actors _ and
occasionally break into song.
   Their renditions of ``A la Bastille'' and ``Rue Saint-Vincent''
bring smiles or tears to customers old enough to remember the war.
Many younger diners know the words well enough to join the singing.
   Bouzy learned the prewar skill of rolling cigarettes, so a
burned-out butt hangs from the corner of his mouth.
   The restaurant, opened four months ago, is the idea of Roland
Petitprez, who developed similar restaurants in Madrid.
   ``Every period has its own form of joie de vivre,'' said
Petitprez, who was a little boy during the war. He remembers going
to a restaurant much like the one he has made.
   ``We went after dark, when the curtains were closed, and we were
able to eat treats like chicken and fried potatoes _ the produce
smuggled in by farmers,'' Petitprez said.
   An antique radio blared the music that signaled wartime news
broadcasts of the British Broadcasting Corp. Hidden radios were
turned on across France to hear how the Allies were doing.
   Guests of Le Couvre-Feu chose more or less authentic food from
the menu.
   ``Herring and potatoes are a period dish that I loved,'' said a
patron, Carla Acquanegra, who remembered growing up during the
German occupation.
   She pronounced the rabbit dish ``delicious and quite true to
tradition,'' but noted that such food ``really was scarce for
people like my family. We didn't have any relatives raising food in
the country.''
   Vegetables of the period included rutabaga, leeks and
``topinambours'' _ Jerusalem artichokes, which were served so often
during the war that Carla now tends to avoid them.
   At one point in the evening, the lights went out, a loud
knocking came at the door and an ``idiot nephew'' of Lulu and
Maurice tumbled in, spilling ill-gotten ``black market'' goods on
the floor to much scolding from Maurice.
   The party resumed. Lulu sang Piaf-style. Some diners
jitterbugged.
   Jerome Mingueneau, the 30-year-old chef, emerged from his
basement kitchen.
   ``I used a 1938 Cordon Bleu and other old cookbooks to re-create
the traditional bourgeois and bistro styles,'' he said.
Mingueneau's pate is from a 1796 recipe.
   Carla chose creme caramel, a typical dessert of the period, but
another guest had a rich chocolate mousse.
   ``There was absolutely no chocolate until the Liberation,''
Carla said.
   Customers pay the equivalent of $52.50 for the show and dinner.
Those who prefer a quiet meal without the dramatics can have lunch
for about $16.50.
   Most patrons are French, but English and Americans come.
   Even some Germans visit The Curfew. ``They're welcome here, and
seem to like it,'' Petitprez said.

<HEAD>Ecologists Applaud Choice for New Environment Minister</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER MUELLO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defenders of nature say the
appointment of Jose Lutzenberger, a noted ecologist, as Brazil's
environment minister could signal an end to wanton destruction of
the Amazon rain forest.
   The choice of Lutzenberger, 63, was seen as a victory for
conservationists, who claim the government has done little to stop
slash-and-burn devastation of the Amazon. He was named by President
Fernando Collor de Mello, who took office March 15.
   By 1988, ranchers and farmers had destroyed about 8 percent of
the rain forest in the 2 million square miles of Amazon wilderness,
said U.S. researcher Philip Fearnside of the National Institute of
Research in the Amazon.
   Carbon dioxide produced by the burning is believed to add to the
``greenhouse effect'' warming the Earth's surface.
   ``Lutzenberger is the right man in the right place; nobody else
has his credibility,'' Johan Dalgas Frisch, head of the Wildlife
Preservation Association in Sao Paulo, said in an interview.
   Antonio Carlos de Oliveira of the ecology group Oikos said: ``He
is superimportant, a legend. We all have the greatest respect and
admiration for him.''
   Lutzenberger seeks radical changes in Brazil's environmental
policy. He favors solar, wind and other natural forms of energy
over the huge hydroelectric complexes of recent decades.
   A Rio newspaper made the wry comment that Lutzenberger was so
radical about protecting nature that he even opposed lawn mowers.
   The new environment minister told The Associated Press: ``We
have to question the fundamental doctrines of modern industrial
society, which is geared to the needs of the powerful. We're not
saying give up technology, but go a different way.''
   In his first week on the job, Lutzenberger spoke out against the
controversial Northern Rim project, which would create army posts
to guard Brazil's vast jungle border.
   He also promised to review a decision that allowed gold miners
to settle on land claimed by the primitive Yanomami Indians.
   Prospectors have invaded Yanomami land in the remote western
Amazon state of Roraima, devastating the forest and bringing
disease and death to the Indians.
   After consulting with Lutzenberger and visiting the area, Collor
ordered the dynamiting of clandestine air strips on tribal land and
said the Northern Rim project would be redirected toward protecting
the environment.
   ``We must remove the prospectors, but we also must give them
decent living conditions,'' Lutzenberger said. ``They are not there
because they're bad or want to destroy.''
   Lutzenberger, a descendant of German immigrants, is an
agronomist with a degree from the University of Louisiana. In the
1970s, he resigned as a chemical company executive to join the
ecology movement and helped found Brazil's first environmental
protection group.
   Later, Lutzenberger established an environmental consulting firm.
   He pushed for tougher laws on pesticide control and for
installation of anti-pollution filters at a cellulose plant in his
native Rio Grande do Sul state, in southern Brazil.
   Lutzenberger was among the first to sound the alarm about the
Amazon.
   ``This problem concerns all of humanity,'' he told reporters
shortly after becoming environment secretary.
   ``It concerns the continuation of life on this planet. This
requires not just plans for preservation, protection or parks. It
requires fundamentally rethinking our economic programs.''
   He appealed for help from industrialized countries.
   ``We must establish now an intensive and continuing dialogue
between the governments of the First World and the Third World on
how we can collaborate to save the last jungles,'' Lutzenberger
told the journalists.
   One way, he said, is to write off part of Brazil's $114 billion
foreign debt against programs to preserve the Amazon.
   Brazil has rejected such ``debt for nature'' swaps on grounds
they violate national sovereignty. Of that, Lutzenberger said:
   ``The idea is to find ways to reduce the debt in exchange for
the preservation of Amazonia by our government. There is not the
slightest intention to `internationalize' the Amazon.''
   A key test of his strength is likely to be a proposed highway
from the western Amazon through Peru to the Pacific.
   Lutzenberger opposes the highway, but Peru and governors of
Brazil's Amazonian states say it is vital to economic development
in the region. Most of the governors supported Collor for president.
   ``The important thing to watch is how much power he has. Let's
see what happens when he conflicts with the highway lobby,''
Fearnside, the U.S. researcher, said in a telephone interview from
Manaus, in the Amazon jungle 3,000 miles northwest of Rio.
   Some fear Lutzenberger's well-known temper and firm convictions
could work against him.
   ``If he's very radical, Collor will be pressured to get rid of
him,'' Frisch said.

<HEAD>ABC's ``Twin Peaks'' Not So Pointed Pointed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Billed as slightly twisted and preceded by
enough hype to fill a railroad hopper car, David Lynch's ``Twin
Peaks,'' a cutting-edge soap opera for prime time, will open Sunday
on ABC with a two-hour premiere.
   Admirers of his cinematic oeuvre _ oeuvre is French for ``whole
bunch of stuff'' _ may say ``Peaks'' has subhematomal echoes of his
neo-noir ``Blue Velvet'' but not the nonlinear Greco-Roman
postmodernism of ``Eraserhead.''
   Well, okay, some critics do talk that way.
   But gee, this series, which starts its regular Thursday run next
week, really seems more like a beautifully filmed Pacific Northwest
edition of ``Peyton Place'' set in avant-garde mist.
   Full of slightly askew moments and characters, it also is rife
with little visual bumps to tip you that Things Are Not Always What
They Seem. It's an admirable effort to battle cable by offering
something different in network TV.
   ABC deserves a cheer for that. But Sunday's premiere, directed
and co-written by Lynch, occasionally edges close to plumb boring.
At times, you fear there has been a ruling that the director, not
the play, is the thing.
   The proceedings occur in Washington, near the Canadian border,
in a small make-believe logging town called Twin Peaks. This
hamlet, surrounded by lovely, cloud-shrouded woods, appears to be
nice, peaceful, normal.
   But all that starts changing early on, when a fisherman
discovers the plastic-wrapped body of a slain high school
homecoming queen. Naturally, her no-good, leather-jacketed
boyfriend is a prime suspect.
   Unlike the usual TV epic, the show's early moments contain
leisurely digressions and characters that aren't firmly and
immediately established. That's not all bad. But it wears thin
after awhile.
   One gets a tad impatient waiting for things to get moving and
for the stylistic fog to lift just a little.
   Those who wait, and they should bring lunch, eventually will
learn that there is a killer at large, apparently a sadist and
rapist who preys on high school girls. A serial killer? Maybe. Or
maybe not. Ominous ambiguity is a major part of the proceedings.
   Bit by bit, you learn that Twin Peaks is full of dark secrets,
subplots and furtive sex between consenting adults, high school
kids or a combination thereof. But that's not enough nowadays.
   So, by golly, there's also surrealism here, although it's the
low-key kind, nothing really far out. For example, nobody suddenly
up and shoots his morning's Wheaties. Too bad. That would give the
show a cereal killer.
   On the bright side, there is a sheriff's deputy who cries every
time he's at a murder scene. Also a deranged-looking psychiatrist
who laughs about his dark secret. And a group of potential land
investors from ... Norway.
   There also is a lovely, mysterious Chinese woman. She has what
seems to be a light secret. Not so two townsfolk, one a brutalized
minor, the other a trucker; they prove to be advertisers in a
swinger's magazine.
   This being the TV version of Lynch's auteur theory, there are
various examples of his celebrated eccentric vision _ like a
nighttime shot of a traffic light changing from green to amber to
red. Hmm, symbolic.
   Other auteur highlights: a bad rich girl's feet in saddle shoes;
a flickering light in a morgue, and a dreamlike fight in a biker
bar as a soft-rock vocalist gently sings.
   Meanwhile, back at the plot, the main event is an investigation
of two things _ the homecoming queen's murder and the rape and
attempted murder of another high school girl.
   The investigators here are Sheriff Harry S. Truman (of course)
and FBI agent Dale Cooper, played by Michael Ontkean and ``Blue
Velvet'' graduate Kyle MacLachlan, respectively.
   The sheriff is the strong, calm type. The young, razor-sharp
agent is a tad weird, amazed at all the Douglas firs he sees, and
constantly dictating all manner of things into his tape recorder,
included a misquote of W.C. Fields.
   Ontkean and MacLachlan are first-rate. In fact, all the actors
in ``Twin Peaks'' are good.
   But the only thing that truly keeps the show interesting is
Angelo Badalamenti's always-moving score. It's a solid plus, even
though mostly played on a synthesizer, a machine that is to music
what helium is to combustion.
   Because of all the hoopla about ``Twin Peaks,'' the show
doubtless will get a large, curious audience _ at least in its
first hour _ on opening night.
   But unless Thursday's continuation of the plot is an improvement
over Chapter One, the series that began as a rare network display
of avant-garde may soon wind up as a video museum piece.

   Elsewhere in television ...
   CAN WE TALK IMMEDIATELY?: Starting April 30, the syndicated
``The Joan Rivers Show'' will be broadcast almost live _ with a
seven-second delay so any naughty bits can be blipped immediately.
Each show previously was shown two to three weeks after it was
taped.
   The idea is to take advantage of River's topical humor
abilities, a spokesman says. Of the 146 stations now carrying her
talk show, 35 will carry the live version, with the others taping
it for same-day broadcast.
   The show also will start featuring top gossip columnists from
newspapers and magazines on a once-a-week basis. Every Monday, one
chosen gossip columnist will relay uplifting lowdown to Rivers'
viewers.

<HEAD>Oil Company Reforms Emerge As Hot Political Issues</HEAD>

20th anniversary observances for Earth Day this month.</NOTE>

   Even an environmental debacle like the
Huntington Beach oil spill generates its own kind of gallows humor,
including this joke among residents:
   Question: What do you get when you mix oil and water?
   Answer: Politicians.
   In this case, it seemed as if there were one politician for
every barrel of oil washing up on Surf City U.S.A.
   So many politicians took to the blackened sands of Huntington
Beach to condemn the Feb. 7 spill from the ruptured American Trader
tanker that Mayor Tom Mays had to ask them to go through his office
first so they wouldn't interfere with the cleanup.
   In this election year, talking tough against the oil companies,
with proposals to ban offshore drilling and to enact strict tanker
safety measures, adds up to smart politics.
   For the first time in a decade, environmentalists, politicians
and even some oil industry executives expect this 20th anniversary
year of Earth Day to bring sweeping reform to the oil industry.
   The reform movement is being pushed by oil spills in Alaska,
California, New York, New Jersey and Louisiana and a growing
feeling among Americans that more should be done to protect the
environment.
   Possible changes include requiring double hulls and bottoms on
tankers, shifting shipping lanes farther offshore, better charting
of the ocean bottom, improving procedures for oil spill cleanup,
and putting a fourth year-long moratorium on new offshore drilling.
   ``The interest in the general public in protecting the coastline
is at an all-time high,'' declared Ann Whitfield, executive
director of the Florida Public Interest Research Group.
   The oil industry, meanwhile, worries about an overreaction that
could stifle U.S. oil production and return the country to the days
of oil embargoes and gas lines.
   But even many oil officials concede more must be done to avoid
spills and to minimize damage when they occur.
   ``While it is impossible to guarantee that future accidents will
never happen, we are committed to working to prevent them and to
improving the industry's safety record,'' said James Benton,
executive director of the New Jersey Petroleum Council.
   Benton spoke at a recent meeting between oil executives and
officials of New York and New Jersey, where four major spills in
the first 10 weeks of 1990 dumped almost 730,000 gallons of heating
oil and heavy crude into the Arthur Kill and Kill van Kull
waterways between New York City and northern New Jersey.
   The first major reform is under consideration in Washington.
Legislation pending in Congress would require double hulls and
double bottoms on tankers. Engineers speculate that a double hull
could have prevented the Huntington Beach spill, apparently the
result of the tanker striking its own anchor, and lessened the
effects of the Exxon Valdez disaster, in which the tanker ripped
open on a reef in Alaska's Prince William Sound.
   Eyes are also on President Bush, who pledged in his campaign to
be the ``environmental president,'' to see whether he will try to
reinstate oil and gas drilling in federal waters after the
moratorium expires this year.
   The issue is of particular importance in California, where oil
companies have proposed developing millions of acres off the coasts
of central and Northern California. Off Florida, companies want to
drill in tracts north of the Keys.
   Many member of Congress say that if Bush decides to resume
additional drilling, they are prepared to seek another moratorium.
   ``The administration is in a quagmire in the sense that the
politics of California, a very crucial gubernatorial race and the
president's own commitments in the state are in conflict with
president's gut instincts as a former oilman on offshore
drilling,'' said Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Monterey.
   Some of the most active work on oil industry reforms is going on
at the state level.
   Even before the Huntington Beach spill, the environment was a
hot political issue in California. All three candidates for
governor _ U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, state Attorney General John Van
de Kamp and former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein _ have
tried to one-up each other in pledging love for Mother Earth.
   Wilson, a Republican, is a longtime opponent of offshore
drilling, so much so that his stance strained relations with the
White House in the early months of the administration.
   In addition, state Controller Gray Davis and Lt. Gov. Leo
McCarthy say their re-election is important to maintain their 2-1
lock on the three-member State Lands Commission _ and a virtual ban
on additional drilling.
   ``I'm a strong environmentalist and I'm committed to remaining a
good steward for California's magnificent coastline,'' Davis said.
   ``It doesn't take a genius to see that if you change one or two
people on that board you change the direction of California's
coast.''

<HEAD>Times Square Plan: Miracle or Mirage?</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After nine years of bickering, 42 lawsuits,
design changes and false starts, a $2.5 billion plan to sanitize
tawdry Times Square is about to become reality.
   Or is it? The 42nd Street Development Project says
groundbreaking is in sight; opponents say it might never come to
pass.
   ``Is it alive or dead? I don't think anybody knows,'' said Kent
Barwick, president of the Municipal Art Society, a non-profit
organization that analyzes and addresses aesthetic issues affecting
New York City, particularly architecture and planning.
   Not a single spade of dirt has been turned in the
government-backed project, but the mere promise of it has helped
trigger brisk construction by private developers elsewhere in the
neighborhood.
   Critics say that means the development project has served its
purpose and should just fade away.
   The project's parent, the state Urban Development Corp., wants
to replace run-down buildings in the historic entertainment
district with four office towers, ranging from 32 to 57 stories and
glitzed up with signs, lights and mirrors. A merchandise mart and
new hotel are on the back burner.
   The idea is to discourage drug dealers, muggers, con artists and
prostitutes.
   ``There's a sense that Times Square has become a more menacing
place,'' said sociologist William Kornblum of the City University
Graduate Center, who has studied the district for 12 years.
   In 1988, 2,246 felony crimes were reported on 42nd Street
between Broadway and Eighth Avenue, an area of just over a block.
   Safety was a major concern of Madeline ``Dominique'' D'Anthony,
proprietor of the Harmony burlesque theater, when she moved three
years ago to the artsy Tribeca area, near Wall Street. Her landlord
had sold the building at 48th Street and Broadway where she'd done
business for 10 years.
   ``Just because I'm in the burlesque business doesn't mean I like
42nd Street,'' she said. ``I was offered a rental situation there
but didn't take it, because I'm not walking down that block.''
   D'Anthony, who strives to keep her business ``tasteful'' _ no
barkers, unseemly pictures or neon `Girls! Girls! Girls!' signs
outside _ said it's wrong to blame the crime on the sex industry.
   ``Volume is what attracts crime,'' she said. ``When you put all
those places together, you create a high-traffic situation _ drug
pushers, pickpockets, they get lost in the crowd. ...
   ``When I left Times Square, I noticed immediately that my good
customers stayed with me and the riff-raff stayed in Times Square.
My girls said the same thing,'' she said.
   Barwick blames the blight on real estate speculation.
   ``Since everybody had been led to believe for generations that
the area would be creamed to make way for high-rise offices, people
weren't taking care of their buildings,'' he said.
   Still, critics say flooding Times Square with office workers in
suits would douse the vitality and offbeat flavor of one of the
world's most famous entertainment districts.
   ``I think the Times Square cacophony is a delight, a visual
riot,'' said Stephen F. Wilder, a member of Community Board 5, a
volunteer advisory board of area residents and business people.
   ``It's truly the one place in the city, historically, where
different classes and races and kinds of people came together,''
said Barwick. ``Cities need such places for their spirit and soul
and their economies.''
   ``Times Square still has a national and international cachet,''
agreed Kornblum. ``One hears, when you interview people on the
streets as we do, a sense of disappointment in some circles: how
did it get to be this shabby? But the whole of Times Square _ the
lights and the glitter _ has the capacity to get people's blood
rushing.''
   Some say the redevelopment would eradicate appealing old
architecture and wipe out cheap entertainment, especially for
low-income patrons.
   Depending on whom you ask, it would cause midtown real estate
values to plummet _ or drive them up, affecting business costs and
livelihoods in the adjoining Garment District.
   Brian Kell, spokesman for the 42nd Street project, said the
groundbreaking for the towers now is targeted for early next year.
   On Thursday, the state Court of Appeals refused to hear a suit
by Wilder that sought further review of the project under state
environmental guidelines.
   Kell predicted his side also would win two final lawsuits within
a few months.
   One, a suit against the Metropolitan Transportation Authority
before the state Court of Appeals, concerns bidding procedures for
Times Square subway reconstruction. In the other, before a federal
court, a realty company is trying to stop the project on grounds,
among others, that it lacks a public purpose.
   After the disposition of the last two suits, Kell expects state
Supreme Court Justice Stanley J. Parness to rule on the 42nd Street
Development Project's request to condemn 34 theaters, book stores,
video shops, T-shirt shops, mom-and-pop grocery stores and other
properties.
   The developers for the Urban Development Corp. project _ the
Prudential Insurance Co. and Park Tower Realty _ can cancel the
deal any time after June 21, said Gary Rosenberg, attorney for the
Durst Organization, which filed three suits against the project.
   ``We believe they have an absolute right to walk at that point
with no liability,'' Rosenberg said. ``We think they will.''
   He said there are no tenants for the proposed office towers.
   ``We expect that at this point everybody is looking for a way
out. You need a good face-saver,'' Rosenberg said.
   But supporters say developers are committed to the project.
   ``Until it is redeveloped, the cancer will remain in the center
of Times Square,'' said Gerald Schoenfeld, chairman of the Shubert
organization and head of the Mayor's Midtown Citizens Committee.
``It is essential to legitimate theater. It is essential to the
image of New York. It is essential to the ... community. It is
essential to tourism.''

<HEAD>Foreign Brokers Making Points Amid Tokyo's Stock Woes</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: John Cunniff is on assignment.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CLAYTON NAFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign brokers, who had a hard time riding the
bulls on the Tokyo stock market, are wrestling the bears with
greater success.
   Nearly all the 50-odd foreign brokerages in Tokyo reported
losing money during the late 1980s. The 22 with seats on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange paid huge sums to get there, and the others faced
vast start-up costs as well. As of March 1988, for example, 14 of
the top 20 foreign houses were in the red.
   But having absorbed the one-time expenses and gained market
experience, many are well-positioned to capitalize on a plunging
market.
   While many decline to specify profits for the first quarter, a
period of sharp decline in Tokyo stocks, they claim an edge in
research, experience with bear markets and facility in hedging
techniques.
   At the French house of W.I. Carr, Deputy Branch Manager John
Price said, ``For the first three months of the year, we're showing
profits on all our books.''
   This resulted, he said, from caution, diversification and a
concentration on advising institutional investors overseas on how
to deal with turbulent Japanese stocks.
   ``When market times are very rough, we do quite well,'' Price
said.
   He said the firm had kept its exposure to stocks down to about
30 percent of its in-house limit during the plunge, while doing
well with alternative investments, such as options and futures.
   ``We're not complaining,'' Price said.
   American firms have deeper experience in trading futures
contracts based on stock market indexes and in arbitrage. Using
computers, they spot profit opportunities in rapidly shifting gaps
between futures and spot prices for stock indexes.
   ``Options in futures provide a tool for dealing with the
downside market,'' said Kevin Parker, chief of futures trading at
Morgan Stanley International.
   Parker said volume on the spot market had been very light,
making it difficult to sell shares without a loss.
   ``You can't sell stocks, but there is ample opportunity ... in
futures to hedge portfolios, and many institutions have done just
that,'' he said.
   Trading in stock-index futures began in Tokyo in September 1988
but became really active only this year. Parker attributed this to
expanding price swings in the market since January, rising to
``over five times the historical average'' in recent days.
   Mike Morizumi, a strategist with Merrill Lynch Japan, said one
result of the market's slump has been to bring his firm's research
capabilities into prominence.
   ``Over the past three years ... just about any company in any
sector showed pretty good earnings and sales. Looking at the fine
print in the balance sheets back then didn't make much
difference,'' he said.
   But the nearly 30 percent loss on the stock market has created
widely divergent trends among Japanese companies, Morizumi added.
   Japanese competitors are formidable in sales strategy, he said,
but their research is often subordinated to sales tactics.
   In contrast, since the market reversal began, ``we've made a lot
of sales points with our research,'' Morizumi said, especially with
Japanese clients whose former brokers had led them to believe the
bulls would run indefinitely.
   Foreign brokerages largely relied on foreign clients in the
past. But this is clearly changing.
   Betty Wu, a broker at Hong Kong-based SBCI Securities (Asia),
said foreign institutional clients had turned increasingly sour on
the Tokyo market this year.
   ``Some have sold out their entire portfolios,'' she said.
   Thus, she said, her company has emphasized domestic sales.
   ``We've been doing well,'' Wu said, ``because we've been very
successful in hiring Japanese sales people ... who have a very
solid client base.''

<HEAD>Shortage Of Dutch Nuns and Priests Sparks Foreign Imports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL VERSCHUUR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ELSHOUT, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nuns, monks and priests once were a
common sight in Dutch schools and hospitals, but some are now being
imported from the United States and elsewhere to keep alive Roman
Catholic orders and clergy.
   Six nuns from the order of Poor Clare in Roswell, N.M., came to
this Dutch village in March in a series of foreign arrivals that
has already brought parish priests from Poland and a university
pastor from Spain.
   Reform-minded Catholics worried about the American nuns'
reputation for conservatism denounce the plan as ``reactionary''
and say it won't work.
   But the church leadership hopes the project will mean
deliverance for an ailing Poor Clare monastery in Eindhoven, 25
miles away, where 14 nuns, aged 48-100, haven't seen any newcomers
since 1984.
   The American sisters will move into a recently renovated
convent, and move to Eindhoven if they succeed in attracting young
Dutch nuns.
   Only 12 Dutch women and 50 men took holy orders or the cloth in
1988, while 898 died and 43 quit, according to a report compiled by
the Catholic research institute KASKI.
   More than 21,000 people in this nation of 14.8 million are
members of a Catholic religious order, but about three quarters of
them live in retirement, the report said.
   ``Faith in all of the Netherlands has been put on the back
burner,'' said Sister Celine, a spokeswoman for the Eindhoven Poor
Clare Monastery of the Immaculate Conception of Mary. ``If we don't
have any new vocations we won't be able to keep this up much
longer.''
   About 60 Poor Clare nuns still live in the Netherlands, where
they are part of what used to be an intensely Catholic social
fabric setting its stamp on much of the nation's southern half.
   In the 1950s, schools, hospitals and homes for the elderly here
were staffed by nuns and priests, and southern Dutch politics were
dominated by the Roman Catholic People's Party, now part of Premier
Ruud Lubbers' Christian Democrats.
   But the era that followed saw rapid economic growth and the
development of a welfare state that took over most of the
charitable work that had been traditional church territory.
   Today, only 15 percent of the Netherlands' 5.5 million nominal
Catholics are regular churchgoers, according to the KASKI report.
   ``The social role of the religious orders has been taken over by
the state ... health care, education, looking after the sick, they
don't have anything left to them in those areas,'' said Kees van
Hasselt, spokesman for Bishop Johannes ter Schure of the southern
diocese of Den Bosch, who supports the Elshout project.
   ``Young people can sign up as (foreign) aid workers'' instead of
becoming missionaries, Sister Celine agreed. ``They get more
opportunity to study, to get better jobs (and) to enjoy
themselves'' in the secular world.
   However, the Elshout project has pitted Bishop ter Schure, a
pro-Vatican hardliner, against liberal Catholics who regard it as
an attempt to yank them back to the straight and narrow.
   ``It's a reactionary plan, part of Den Bosch's policy of turning
back the clock,'' said Peter de Rijk of the May Eight Movement,
which spearheaded opposition within the Catholic Church to the 1985
Dutch visit of Pope John Paul II.
   De Rijk noted that the sisters from Boswell will be living in
strict separation from the outside world. Dutch Clarissan nuns no
longer observe that statute, which once made the Poor Clare order
one of the most ascetic groups in the Catholic Church.
   ``This is no way to restore monastic life. It's certainly not a
method that we would approve of,'' said Ton Smits of the Dutch
Monastic Association, which represents all Catholic religious
orders.
   The liberal response is similar to widespread criticism
triggered by the 1988 arrival of three priests from the pontiff's
native Poland, and of a Spanish university pastor in 1982.
   ``We are daughters of the church, very loyal to the Holy
Father,'' said a spokeswoman for the Roswell group, Mother Mary
Francis. ``We're coming to serve, not to argue. I hate anybody to
be suspicious of us.''

   The heads of two major Protestant denominations
say they were outraged that heavy Panamanian civilian deaths ``were
virtually ignored by our government and media'' in connection with
the December U.S. invasion.
   The Rev. Paul Sherry of the United Church of Christ and the Rev.
John O. Humbert of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)
voiced their criticism in a joint letter to officials of the Latin
American Council of Churches.
   The U.S. church leaders said they had been concerned at the
``cruelty of Gen. Manuel Noriega,'' who removed from Panamanian
rule in the invasion, but the churchmen added:
   ``We do not support an action that represents such a flagrant
violation of national sovereignty and disregard for human life.''
   The letter charged ``around 2,000 Panamanians'' were killed in
the U.S. military action. Panamanian authorities say 314
Panamanians died, 202 of them civilians, and 23 Americans.

<HEAD>Senate Republicans on the Offensive in 1990 Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The numbers say this election year should be a
good one for Democrats to strengthen their hold on the Senate. But
since candidates and not numbers win elections, it's the GOP that's
on the offensive.
   ``We have a better crop of challengers this time than we've ever
had,'' said Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., chairman of the National
Republican Senatorial Committee.
   ``I'd be happy and pleased and I think we would say we've done a
good job if we stay the same'' in Democratic strength, said Sen.
John Breaux, D-La., chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee.
   By tradition, an off-year election bodes well for the party that
doesn't control the White House. And from a distance, it looks like
this one should follow the pattern.
   Democrats have a 55-45 majority in the Senate, but the
Republicans have more seats at risk. Of the 34 Senate seats on the
line, the GOP must defend 18 and the Democrats 16.
   Three incumbent Republicans are retiring, heightening the
apparent Democratic opportunity.
   But seven months before the election, it appears the Democrats
have failed to recruit many top-flight candidates while the GOP has
succeeded. That gives Republicans hope they can narrow the
Democrats' majority this year and perhaps reclaim control of the
Senate in 1992.
   In all three cases where Republican senators are stepping down
this year, GOP House members have stepped forward as candidates and
are the early front-runners.
   In Colorado, where Sen. Bill Armstrong is retiring, Rep. Hank
Brown hopes to step into the breach. Popular Rep. Robert Smith is
running for the seat being vacated by Sen. Gordon Humphrey in New
Hampshire. And in Idaho, Rep. Larry Craig is seeking to succeed
Sen. James A. McClure.
   Four other House Republicans are taking the far riskier leap
into races against incumbent Democrats _ creating potentially the
hottest Senate contests in the nation.
   The Iowa Senate campaign already is steaming as Republican Rep.
Tom Tauke challenges incumbent Democrat Tom Harkin. In Illinois,
GOP Rep. Lynn Martin has had help from President Bush in her
challenge against Democratic Sen. Paul Simon.
   In Rhode Island, Republican Rep. Claudine Schneider is trying to
unseat a popular but aging Democratic Sen. Claiborne Pell. And in
Michigan, Republican Rep. Bill Schuette is in a primary fight
against conservative activist Clark Durant for the right to
challenge Democratic Sen. Carl Levin.
   Another close race is shaping up in Nebraska, where former
Republican Rep. Hal Daub, who failed in a Senate bid two years ago,
is challenging Democratic incumbent Sen. J. James Exon. Another
Democratic incumbent that Republicans consider vulnerable is Sen.
Max Baucus of Montana. The list of Republican challengers there
includes Lt. Gov. Allen Kolstad.
   Meanwhile, no Republican senators who are seeking re-election
appear to be in serious trouble so far. Poll results suggest that
GOP Sens. Jesse Helms in North Carolina and Mitch McConnell in
Kentucky are vulnerable, but potential Democratic challengers still
are fighting among themselves in both states.
   Although some House Democrats flirted with entering Senate
races, none did. And in several cases, popular present and former
state office holders passed up seemingly good opportunities to move
to Washington.
   The Democrats tried hard to recruit candidates ``but their
efforts just seemed to come up a little bit short,'' said political
analyst Charles Cook. Finding a good Senate candidate is mostly
luck of the draw and ``this time, the Republicans got all the
breaks,'' he said.
   The result is apparent security for the GOP _ even a slim chance
of taking control of the Senate if they can sweep all of the close
races _ while ``Democrats have too many seats close to the edge,''
Cook said.
   A 50-50 split would give Republicans control, because the
Republican vice president would break tie votes.
   If the Republicans trimmed the Democratic majority to less than
two or three seats after this election, the GOP would be in a good
position to retake the Senate in 1992 when 20 Democrats and only 14
Republicans face re-election.
   There is talk of two more races being added to the 34 scheduled
this fall.
   Hawaii Democrat Spark Matsunaga has cancer and must be brought
into the Senate chamber by wheelchair to vote. Although he has not
indicated he will resign, potential successors have been quietly
eyeing his seat.
   A Senate Ethics Committee investigation of Sen. Dave
Durenberger's personal finances has led to speculation that the
Minnesota Republican might resign if serious charges were brought.
   Breaux, who leads the Senate Democrats' campaign committee, said
his lack of Senate challengers from the House isn't the handicap
the Washington cognoscenti make it out to be.
   ``Who's to say that House members are better candidates than
people who are not from Washington and can run against the mistakes
and the problems that Washington is in fact responsible for?'' he
asked.
   Breaux acknowledged, though, that he's hoping for some upsets.
One race where he sees potential is Democratic businessman Ted
Muenster's bid to oust Republican Sen. Larry Pressler in South
Dakota.
   The Democratic drive to hold the line this year is fueled by the
specter of 1992.
   ``I'm running down the track looking over my left shoulder and
then I turn and look over my right shoulder,'' said Breaux, who
faces re-election himself in two years.
   Neither Breaux nor Nickles saw an overriding national theme in
this year's races.
   Breaux said the abortion issue could help Democrats in several
pro-choice states where the Republican candidate has an
anti-abortion stance, as is the case in Iowa and Michigan. It also
could give Democrats an upset, perhaps in New Hampshire or Oregon,
where anti-abortion incumbent Mark O. Hatfield is being challenged
by Democratic businessman Harry Lansdale.
   Nickles discounts abortion's role in the next election.
Republican gubernatorial losses in New Jersey and Virginia last
fall may have been due to anti-abortion stands because
``Republicans did a poor job responding,'' and that won't happen
this time, he said.

<TEXT>
   An unexpected resurrection of nations from
totalitarianism has swept Eastern Europe in recent months,
reintroducing long-trampled freedoms and reducing international
distrust. The first story in a five-part Easter series,
``Resurrection of Nations,'' examines the surprising upheaval and
its religious threads.

<TEXT>
   In a blink, the landscape heaved and the world changed. People
could hardly believe it. Amazed, incredulous, they saw a new
reality dawning over the earth, surmounting old fears and fatalism.
   The grim, immutable facts of their existence were suddenly not
what they had seemed.
   That baffled astonishment among Eastern Europeans at their burst
from bondage also resonates in the recorded reaction to the
resurrection of Christ and the liberating word of Easter.
   ``It has indeed been miraculous, a miracle that happened in the
souls of people,'' said the Rev. John Meyendorff, a scholar of the
Russian-derived but independent Orthodox Church in America. ``It
has been a resurrection from a long deadening of individual
creativity and the God-given dignity of being human for millions of
people.''
   No one could have predicted its suddenness and sweep, he said.
``I never thought I'd live to see it. People are finding it hard to
believe.''
   An ``idle tale,'' he apostles scoffed at first reports of
Christ's resurrection. It made no sense, the buried restored to
life? They couldn't conceive of it until it confronted them,
directly and plainly.
   Likewise, it had seemed impossible that half a continent
coumenon, the Berlin Wall _ that barrier of cold war that for three
decades had divided humanity, literally and figuratively _ at last
came tumbling down Nov. 9.
   Among rejoicing throngs, an East German friar said with a
chuckle, ``The iron curtain is not so much iron anymore.''
   The wall's demise and the rest of the whirlwind that freed
nations and eased superpower antagonisms symbolically reflected a
Scripture passage on Christ's crucifixion and resurrection:
   ``For he is our peace, who has made us both one, and has broken
down the dividing wall of hostility.''
   The changes came in tidal profusion in the Soviet Union and its
satellite countries, one after another, like some pent-up force
breaking loose, uncontainable, overflowing, toppling tyrants,
unleashing multitudes from their chains.
   Almost magically, the changes came generally without violence,
in so-called ``soft'' or ``velvet'' revolutions.
   ``Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, says the Lord of
hosts,'' the biblical prophet Zechariah said.
   Just as Christ's resurrection defied logic, so on another plane
did the breakthrough of nations. The sweeping transformation of
1989 contradicted all prior analyses and predictions. It went
against the prognostications of the keenest thinkers and the
gloomiest doomsayers.
   ``It is difficult to think of any series of developments more
astonishing,'' said Roman Catholic historian-theologian Richard
McBrien.
   Harvard historian Richard Pipes wrote: ``The recent events there
have surpassed the wildest fantasies of any observer of Soviet
affairs who was willing to go on record.''
   The facts, those grim facts of life in the Soviet bloc, were
suddenly turned upside down. Just as the crucified arose, Eastern
Europe's long coerced and silenced millions lurched forth into the
exhilarating, yet bewilderingly unfamiliar light of new freedom.
   ``We are like children waking from a nightmare in the middle of
the night,'' Emilian Mercan, a member of the hastily formed
provisional government of Craiova, Romania, said after the
mid-December collapse of the harsh Ceausescu regime. ``All we want
is reassurance that it won't happen again.''
   Gradually, the countries of Eastern Europe are permitting such
gifts to the spirit as the freedoms to speak out, assemble,
organize and vote. But the daybreak atmosphere, like life itself,
is loaded with risk and uncertainty.
   ``It happened so quickly,'' said Petar Darliev, a Bulgarian
imprisoned for nine years who at 74 is helping plan the country's
first multiparty elections in 45 years, scheduled for June. ``The
hard part starts now.''
   It ``is a peculiar drama, which no Earthling could have
written,'' said previously imprisoned playwright Vaclav Havel,
chosen to be Czechoslovakia's president by a new parliament in
December. General elections are set for June 8.
   Of the times before the crucifixion, the apostle Paul wrote,
``We know that the whole world has been groaning in travail until
now.''
   For much of the 20th century, the globe has been groaning,
caught in a tightening nuclear stranglehold, with no apparent way
to escape.
   But the metamorphosis provided by Christ has come, in a
different order, for nations. Writing after Christ rose from the
tomb, Paul said, ``So then you are no longer strangers and
sojourners, but fellow citizens ... and members of the household of
God.''
   The pace and scope of the changes have left statesmen and
pundits groping for reasons, scrambling to adjust to the
transfigured scene. They came in such a mounting crescendo as to
seem almost sheer revelation.
   ``One sees evidence of divine providence in human events like
this,'' said church historian Robert T. Handy. ``Who could have
thought it would happen?''
   Handy, historian emeritus of New York's Union Theological
Seminary, said he was ``worried about a backlash. We're still
dealing with politics.'' But he cited church involvement in Eastern
Europe's reform movements in saying:
   ``The ferment for freedom has always been very strong in the
Jewish-Christian tradition. It boils up again and again, and has
throughout history. It can be put down, but it boils up again. .. .
   ``The hand of God can be seen in these developments,'' Handy
added. ``God does work in history.''
   So do people, what Scripture calls God's co-workers. Jesus, in
giving up his life for a greater one at Easter, said people would
have to endure oppression and pain, but a better time beckoned.
   ``You will be sorrowful,'' he said before his death at the hands
of an occupation military regime that dominated a subjugated
people. ``But your sorrow will turn into joy.''

the core of communism, the Soviet Union, is the focus of the second
story in a five-part Easter series, ``Resurrection of Nations.''

   When Secretary of State James A. Baker III met with Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze in Wyoming last fall, they
exchanged gifts. Baker gave cowboy boots to Shevardnadze, who
presented Baker with an enameled picture of Jesus teaching the
people.
   ``You see,'' Shevardnadze remarked, ``even we communists are
changing our world view.''
   Recalling the incident later, Baker surmised that some innate
``resurgence of faith'' may have been at the roots of the
revolutionary changes sweeping Eastern Europe.
   The lightning-like reformation that has flashed over the Soviet
colossus and its peripheries is ``so striking that it marks the
beginning of a new era something is happening at the churches.''
   In the land where 15th century reformer Martin Luther fired his
protest against Rome's ecclesiastical domination, the churches
became havens, rallying places and an umbrella for political as
well as religious voices of reform.
   ``No other social force in the country had independence from the
state and party'' and could thus supply space for dialogue and
inspiration, said pastor Werner Widrat of Lutheran Gethsemane
Church in East Berlin.
   Bolstering their peaceful tactics, the pre-demonstration
services often included Scripture readings from the Beatitudes:
``Blessed are the peacemakers. ... Blessed are those who are
presecuted for righteousness sake, for theirs is the kingdom of
heaven.''
   The churches had adopted the non-violent tactics of Martin
Luther King Jr. and Mohandas Gandhi. Typical of church messages
issued in the crisis was this from Thuringia's Lutheran Bishop
Werner Leich:
   ``I beg you ... no matter what happens, do not deviate from the
principle of non-violence. ... Do not let yourselves be intimidated
any longer. ... No renewal in the truth can come about unless we
are willing to be bold and make sacrifices. ... God has given us
the spirit of strength. ... Our present way will not be easy. But
we shall succeed. ... Let us stand together.''
   Crowds in Bitterfeld and elsewhere sang the American civil
rights anthem, ``We Shall Overcome.''
   Communist ruler Erich Honecker, whose iron-fisted rule lasted 18
years, was deposed Oct. 18. The Berlin Wall was opened Nov. 9. On
Jan. 14, church mediators stopped the storming of East Berlin's
secret police headquarters.
   Church leaders were credited for a pivotal role in the whole
affair by world leaders, including Secretary of State James A.
Baker III and former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt.
   In ensuing sessions of the caretaker government, New Forum,
church figures led the transition prior to last month's elections.
   East Berlin Lutheran pastor Rainer Epplemann, an early leader in
church opposition to the regime, served as minister without
portfolio in the interim government. He also headed the Democratic
Reawakening Party, allied with the March 18 winning coalition
favoring reunion with West Germany.
   At the same time, Lutheran pastor Christian Fuehrer of Leipzig's
St. Nicholas Church warned against resurgent nationalism and
obsession with Western riches, saying:
   ``The Coca-Cola culture is taking over and people are rushing
blindly to change one set of chains for another.''
   And in a gesture of basic Christian compassion, Lutheran Bishop
Gottfried Forck of Berlin-Brandenburg temporarily sheltered the
fallen Honecker. He and his wife, Margot, were declared
``homeless'' after a court ruled that the 77-year-old dictator's
illness prevented jailing him on charges of high treason.
   Forck arranged for them to stay in two spare rooms at the home
of Lutheran pastor Uwe Homer, noting that the shelter was offered
in the spirit of Christian mercy to sinners.
   The broad turn to democracy started earlier and proceeded more
gradually in Poland and Hungary.
   In Poland, visited three times by the pope, stubborn strikes and
demonstrations in 1980 gave birth to the Solidarity labor union,
the first in Eastern Europe. The union, backed by the church, was
outlawed in 1982 under martial law.
   Its leader, Lech Walesa, was arrested and other union leaders
were driven underground, but the union maintained pressure on the
government. The pressure, coupled with a disastrous economy, forced
negotiations last year that led to the June 4 elections when
Solidarity swept into control of parliament.
   In May 1988, Hungary ousted its puppet party boss, Janos Kadar,
who had ruled for 32 years, ever since Soviet tanks crushed a
Hungarian uprising in 1956.
   A national catharsis came June 16, 1989, when bodies of executed
leaders of the revolt, including that of Prime Minister Imre Nagy,
were exhumed from unmarked graves and reburied with honors.
   In January 1989, Hungary cut the electrified barbed wire along
its border with Austria, opening it to vacationing East Germans and
others fleeing communist oppression.
   All Soviet troops are to be withdrawn from Hungary by June 30,
1991, and last month's multiparty elections were seen as the advent
of working democracy.
   God ``gives power to the faint,'' wrote the biblical prophet
Isaiah. They ``shall renew their strength, they shall mount up with
wings like eagles.''

   The rout of communism spread swiftly but
peaceably to Czechoslovakia. The fourth story in a five-part Easter
series, ``Resurrection of Nations,'' concerns the Czech surge to
freedom and the rise of a `Wenceslas' heritage, as well as
Bulgaria's repudiation of communism.

   He was a beloved king, Wenceslas, sainted and celebrated in song
and story, elevated to Czechoslovakia's throne in 922 in a popular
uprising against an anti-religious tyrant who had seized power by
force and murder.
   A statue of the good king presides over Prague's historic
gathering place, Wenceslas Square, where 10 days of huge protest
marches culminated Nov. l7 in the overthrow of another dictatorship
and the choice of another leader named Wenceslas.
   That is the Latinized form of the Czech name ``Vaclav,'' which
is the first name of Vaclav Havel, the repeatedly imprisoned
playwright and straight-talking dissenter against authoritarianism,
now the country's president.
   Plainly surprised, even awestruck at the spontaneous rise of the
populace against 40 years of Soviet-armed communist rule, Havel
called it one of those strangely true contradictions, ``the power
of the powerless.''
   This is the sort of paradox manifested in the Easter events, the
crucifixion of Jesus, his disciples scattered, in hiding, but then
his resurrection in glory.
   ``He was crucified in weakness, but lives by the power of God,''
Scripture says.
   On a temporal level, the sweeping overturn of communism across
Eastern Europe has brought another kind of rebirth, also astounding.
   ``It's a spiritual resurrection,'' said Olga Hruby, Czech-born
editor of the U.S. documentary journal, Religion in Communist
Dominated Areas. ``Freedom had been buried for a long time. Now
it's alive.
   ``People ... underwent terrible agonies and suffering. Now they
have been restored to citizenship and given back their spiritual
freedom. They've been resurrected.''
   In cobblestoned Wenceslas Square, a half-mile long and 200 feet
wide in the ``golden city'' of medieval towers and baroque domes,
Havel's Dec. 29 elevation to the presidency was greeted by
firecracker salutes, streamers and an embracing, singing throng.
   ``Your government, my people, has been returned to you,'' he
said in his first televised address to the nation Jan. l,
paraphrasing a 17th century Moravian religious reformer, John Amos
Comenius.
   ``Everywhere in the world, people were surprised at how these
malleable, humiliated, cynical citizens of Czechoslovakia ... found
the tremendous strength to cast off a totalitarian system in an
entirely peaceful and dignified manner within a few weeks,'' Havel
said.
   ``We ourselves were surprised at it.''
   Proclaiming amnesty for political prisoners and those convicted
of non-violent crimes, he urged people ``to help them in a
Christian spirit ... to find in themselves what our prisons could
not instill: repentance and a desire to lead a good life.''
   Havel, 53, who served five years in prison for criticizing
repressive rule, ascribed the new freedom to the suffering of
others who had struggled courageously in the Soviet Union, East
Germany, Hungary, Poland and elsewhere.
   Referring to the years of persecutions, with many dying in
prisons, many executed and thousands of lives destroyed, he said,
``It was these great sacrifices which wove ... the backdrop of our
newly charged freedom.
   ``All human suffering concerns each human being'' he said.
   This is a biblical principle, that humanity is interlinked and
that abuse of anyone, anywhere, imperils everyone, everywhere.
   Christianity holds that those who share the cross of Christ, in
bearing their own cross for others, share ultimately in his triumph
of resurrection.
   ``Upon him was the chastisement that made us whole,'' Scripture
says.
   Czechoslovakia's aging, once imprisoned Catholic Bishop
Frantisek Tomacek helped lay the groundwork for upheaval in 1985,
gathering 600,000 signatures on petitions demanding religious
freedom.
   When the November demonstrations prompted beatings and arrests,
Tomacek risked new arrest by recalling the previously ignored plea
and commending ``this huge protest against injustices committed
against us for decades.''
   All around, he said, countries ``have broken out of the prison
of totalitarian systems. We must not wait any longer. It is
necessary to act.''
   Such encouragement helped push crowds in Wenceslas Square to a
half million despite 20-degree weather. ``For the first time we
aren't scared anymore,'' exclaimed Martin Jestrik, a cinema student
and demonstration organizer.
   The undaunted marchers forced out the communist autocrat, Milos
Jakes, and the entire party resigned Dec. 3. It was replaced by a
provisional non-communist coalition, Civic Forum, whose initial
moderator and chief spokesman was he once imprisoned Catholic
priest Vaclav Maly.
   In the Prague demonstrations, he leaped to the platform and led
demonstrators in the Lord's prayer.
   Freely competing political parties were authorized and a new
cabinet was installed Dec. l0, involving several prominent
Christians. Among them were Jan Carnogursky, a Catholic lawyer
freed from prison in November, as deputy premier and Czech Brethren
theologian Josef Hromodka as vice president.
   Havel, seen making the sign of the cross at worship services in
St. Vitus Cathedral celebrating the downfall of communist rule,
told an interviewer:
   ``I have observed that our revolution, thanks to its heavenly
director, has several elements of classical drama and theater of
the absurd.''
   In customary black denims and sweater at his rather disarrayed
third-floor offices in Hradcany castle, he grinned, puzzling over
his ``curious passage from jail to the castle.''
   With mail piled on the floor and young assistants bustling
about, he occasionally called time out. ``Let's all laugh for a
minute.''
   A papal visit to Czechoslovakia is scheduled April 21-22, and
multiparty elections are set for June 8. Havel got the Soviets to
agree to remove their troops by July 31, 1991.
   Concurrent with Czechoslovakia's renewal, presistent
demonstrations in Bulgaria, initially crushed, forced out the
communist ruler of 35 years, Todor Zhivkov, on Nov. 10. He is in
prison charged with murder and other crimes.
   Subsequent demonstrations in December demanded greater
democracy. A score of opposition groups hopes to end communist
control in June elections, the first in 45 years.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III, visiting the
Bulgarian capital of Sofia on Feb. 10, told a cheering crowd, ``You
are the people who have brought Bulgaria to a new age of
democracy.''
   Havel, addressing Congress in Washington on Feb. 21, observed,
``It is all very extraordinary.'' He added:
   ``The only genuine backbone for all our actions, if they are to
be moral, is responsibility _ responsibility to something higher
than my family, my country, my firm, my success.''
   If ``this voice'' of conscience is put ahead of politics,
economics or whatever, he said, the new leadership ``can't go far
wrong.''
   A sign seen in Prague ticks off a timetable of the accelerating
democratic upsurges: ``Poland l0 years, Hungary l0 months, East
Germany l0 weeks, Czechoslovakia, 10 days, Romania, 10 hours.''
   ``The bows of the mighty are broken,'' records the prophet
Samuel, ``but the feeble gird on strength.''

<TEXT>
   Margaret Thatcher is not the only grocer's
daughter to disturb the old order. Lady Shirley Porter is trying to
dust the cobwebs off Westminster, which includes Buckingham Palace
and Westminster Abbey.
   As leader of Westminster City Council since 1983, Lady Porter
has struggled to make one of Britain's richest municipalities run
as efficiently as her father's supermarket chain.
   The sprawling metropolis of London has no citywide government or
mayor. Each of the 32 boroughs elects its own council, which in
turn picks a leader. Westminster's 60 councilors are up for
election in May.
   Lady Porter, wholeheartedly embracing Prime Minister Thatcher's
free- market revolution, has sold the borough's garbage collection
and recreation facilities to private contractors.
   Since she became head of the council, more than 9,000
council-owned apartments have been sold to their occupants as part
of a national effort to turn tenants of public housing into
property owners.
   She is an international expert on litter and often is seen
walking around her bailiwick, picking it up. Lady Porter entered
politics in 1974 specifically to tackle trash, and lists her
recreations in Who's Who as ``cleaning up London'' and
``waste-hunting.''
   Her animated brand of radical conservatism invites frequent
comparisons with Mrs. Thatcher, who grew up above her father's
grocery store.
   Sir Jack Cohen, Lady Porter's father, parlayed an East London
vegetable stall into the Tesco supermarket chain and imbued his
younger daughter with his motto: ``You can't do business sitting on
your armchair.''
   Lady Porter became head of Westminster Council as a free-market
Conservative determined to eradicate the socialist structures that
had long dominated local government in Britain.
   Her strong-willed, sometimes autocratic style has inspired
allegations of financial mismanagement, most notably after
Westminster sold three old cemeteries for the equivalent of 8 cents
each. Critics claimed it was a case of desecrating the dead to cut
costs.
   In addition to councils, some boroughs have ceremonial Lord
Mayors. Westminster's handles the extensive ritual associated with
a 400-year-old district in the heart of a pageantry-loving country.
   An American-style mayor is more to Lady Porter's taste, and she
would like to be one. She said it's the best way to ``cut through
the bickering and the red tape and serve the interests of the
people.''
   She sees her goal as saving Westminster from becoming home to
only the very rich and very poor. Lady Porter says she wants to
give Westminster back to the middle classes, ``to encourage them to
stay so that we don't finish up like New York.''
   A recent survey by the magazine Harpers and Queen said Lady
Porter was the 20th richest woman in Europe, with an estimated
personal fortune of 50 million pounds ($84.5 million). Her title
derives from the knighthood of her husband, Sir Leslie Porter.
   Lady Porter's family background was reflected in her comment
recently to a meeting of foreign journalists: ``We believe in
services to the customer. We are a service-oriented council. It's
in my blood that people should be treated as customers.''
   Her 170,000 customers are Westminster's permanent residents.
They include the members of the royal family, who live at and
around Buckingham Palace, and the prime minister, currently Mrs.
Thatcher, who lives down the road at 10 Downing Street.
   Every day, the population is swollen to more than 1 million by
tourists, shoppers and workers who throng the Oxford Street
shopping district, West End theaters, Hyde Park, Victoria Station,
the Houses of Parliament, the government offices of Whitehall, and
the local church, Westminster Abbey.
   They leave enough litter to fill Trafalgar Square to the height
of Admiral Nelson's column five times a year.
   Westminster claims no council has done more than Lady Porter's
to fight rubbish. Prince Philip, who once accompanied her on
garbage inspection detail, has taken to greeting her at social
functions by calling across the room: ``How are the litter bins?''
   Businesses pay for the upkeep of 500 garbage cans, and 31
uniformed wardens can fine litterers of 10 pounds ($17) on the
spot. A telephone hotline is planned for residents to report
litterers, noise and curb-fouling dogs.
   Permanent residents get discounts on tourist attractions.
Residents can deal with officials by telephone or fax and
``one-stop services'' mean the availability at one counter of
everything from election registration to parking permits.
   Westminster is among the first British boroughs to introduce
glass recycling bins.
   The National and Local Government Officers' Association said 70
ranking officials had quit the Westminster government since Lady
Porter took over. One was Chief Executive Rodney Brooke, who left
last year with a retirement package said to be worth 1 million
pounds ($1.7 million).
   Brooke's retirement deal enhanced a controversy already swirling
around the sale in 1987 of the three rundown and unused cemeteries.
   The council said it wanted to save 450,000 pounds ($760,000) in
annual maintenance. The cemeteries, on prime development land, have
been resold several times.
   Scotland Yard's fraud squad found no criminal wrongdoing after a
year of investigation, but the district auditor's report concluded
the council had no authority to dispose of the cemeteries.
Westminster Council is suing the lawyers who advised it on the sale.
   Opposition Labor Party councilors also have attacked the council
for building Britain's most expensive parking lot _ 100 spaces in
Soho that cost 4 million pounds ($6.76 million) _ and for giving
grants to private landlords to repair luxury apartments.

<TEXT>
   When David Grossman got married, a distant aunt
turned up at the ceremony with a Band-Aid hiding the number
tattooed on her arm.
   It was as though being a concentration camp survivor was
something she should hide, something that brought shame and should
not surface at a happy celebration. ``It was awful,'' the Israeli
novelist recalls.
   Memories such as that permeate ``See Under: Love,'' the
36-year-old author's hugely ambitious attempt to portray the
Holocaust as it has filtered through to Israel's post-Holocaust
generation _ the sons and daughters who had no direct experience of
the horror, yet are profoundly influenced by its legacy.
   Published in the original Hebrew in 1986, the novel has just
appeared in English to rare acclaim from British critics.
   ``See Under: Love'' is a sprawling book, innovatively
constructed, bursting with literary magic, and in the end strangely
upbeat. The opening 86-page section alone is what George Steiner in
The Sunday Times called ``one of the great feats in modern
fiction.''
   It tells of Momik, a lonely, precocious 9-year-old growing up in
the Israel of 1959, among parents and neighbors who survived the
Holocaust. An ordinary kid would hunger to know the Facts of Life.
Momik searches for the facts of death: Why will nobody tell him
what exactly happened ``over there''? What is this thing they call
``the Nazi beast''? What are those tattooed numbers _ secret codes?
   ``Momik tried everything to wash Grandfather's arm, but the
number stayed fixed, which gave Momik an idea that maybe the number
wasn't written from the outside but from the inside, and that
convinced him more than ever that there was somebody there inside
Grandfather, and the others too maybe, which is how they call out
for help. ...''
   Someone tells him that ``the Nazi Beast could come out of any
kind of animal if it got the right care and nourishment,'' so he
keeps caged rodents in the cellar, trying to make the beast spring
from one of them and be tamed.
   In the second section, Momik is a young author trying to write
about the Holocaust. He is convinced that he has finally grasped
its meaning _ that he must be tough, unloving and pessimistic, to
be ready when it happens again.
   ``If I ever had a child,'' Momik tells his wife, ``the first
thing I would do in the morning would be to slap his face. Just
like that. So he'll know there's no justice in this world, only
strife.''
   Part 3 is about Momik's grandfather, Anshel Wasserman, once a
famous writer of children's stories who is now in a concentration
camp. Neigel, the Nazi commandant who grew up on Wasserman's books,
makes him tell him a story every night. Wasserman's cunningly woven
stories coax a spark of humanity out of Neigel that drives the Nazi
to suicide.
   This sequence leads into the final section in which Grossman
attempts to tie the threads together in an inventive, encyclopedic
format and deliver the book's ultimate message of love and hope.
   The book is full of allusions, double-meanings and magical
fantasies: of the Wandering Jew as a salmon forever swimming toward
its beginnings; of a Messiah whose gift is to relieve people of
their past; of the baby Kazik who lives an entire human life from
birth to death in 24 hours; of Anshel Wasserman himself, blessed,
or cursed, with a strange inability to be killed by gas or bullets.
   Comparisons to Guenther Grass, Salman Rushdie and Gabriel Garcia
Marquez are inevitable, and have been made by some critics.
   Writing about the Holocaust is not easy. One of the finest
survivor-authors, the Israeli novelist Aharon Appelfeld, has made
his mark in Holocaust literature by writing not about the
atrocities, but around them, believing that ``the Holocaust is a
flame too hot to be touched.''
   ``That's perhaps because he went through the fire,'' Grossman
said in an interview during a visit to London. ``My feeling was
that my own life would go up in flames if I didn't put my hand in
the fire, because there was a fire there all the time, and I knew I
wouldn't understand it until I put my hand in it.''
   Grossman and his parents did not go through the Holocaust. But
like Momik, he grew up ``with these silences always around me.''
The Israel of his youth was not yet ready to delve into the horror.
It was too busy absorbing immigrants, building an army, making the
desert bloom. Its role model was the fighting Israeli, not the Jew
being led to the gas chamber.
   Incidents such as the one involving the aunt and the Band-Aid
were typical, he says, of how ``the survivors themselves
collaborated with this denial. They felt themselves to be the
symbol of the weak Jew ... in this new, advanced, slightly
arrogant, militaristic Israel.''
   At school, he says, ``I learned more about the French Revolution
than I did about the Holocaust.'' But the complexes rubbed off all
the same.
   ``I know how much I have to fight against things in myself,''
says the bespectacled, slightly built Israeli. ``I also feel the
footprints of this fear of annihilation, this suspicion toward
everyone. I have to invest so much energy to NOT distrust people,
to take them on faith, to enjoy life, just to live.''
   Clearly, he succeeded. His other well-known book, ``The Yellow
Wind,'' was an agonizing account of Palestinian life under Israeli
occupation, and he has campaigned hard for Israel to talk to the
Palestinians. He was sacked from his job at Israel Radio over an
order forbidding the broadcast of PLO voices, and reinstated after
a public outcry. Government censors briefly barred school-age
audiences from viewing a play based on ``The Yellow Wind.''
   ``We survived (the Holocaust) in order to live, and now we live
in order to survive,'' he says. ``To live, you have to be flexible
_ to accept changes and turn them to your advantage. The survivor
can't accept changes ... to open up, to take a risk _ these are
abilities that have atrophied among us.''

<HEAD>Taiwanese Demand Policy Changes Because of Pollution</HEAD>
<HEAD>By ANNIE HUANG</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents alarmed by pollution are
demanding the government change policies that helped create an
economic miracle, but also led to environmental disaster.
   ``Taipei residents inhale so much dirty air they have almost
become vacuum cleaners,'' said Lin Pi-yao, a chemistry professor at
Tunghai University.
   Blockades of factories, protest rallies and marches have become
ordinary events in Taiwan.
   Demonstrations have forced some businesses to close and others
to consider moving overseas. The government has promised billions
of dollars will be spent to clean up the mess.
   ``We shall no longer allow certain people to make a fortune by
having others sacrifice their right to a better environment,'' said
Eugene Chien, head of the government's Environmental Protection
Administration.
   ``Most of our factories have begun to enforce better pollution
control, but people want to see the results quickly. They don't
trust any commitments.''
   Such comments are new from a government that has gone all out to
build a prosperous export-oriented economy while doing little to
force pollution control on industries.
   Policies that helped take this densely populated island of 20
million to the rank of 13th in trading volume also made Taiwan
arguably one of the world's filthiest places.
   Official reports say 34 percent of the rivers are polluted and
little clean water is found outside the remote highlands of central
Taiwan.
   ``Most villagers ... have virtually given up protecting the
rivers, which have become drainage ditches for factories,'' said
Shih Hsin-min, professor of chemical engineering at National Taiwan
University.
   A perpetual haze envelops Taipei, the capital, caused by
pollutants that include exhaust from 1 million cars and motorcycles
used by the city's 3 million people.
   Cases of pollution by individual factories have attracted wide
attention.
   Chinese Petroleum Corp., a state-owned concern, hooked 20,000
nearby residents to a piped water system because their well water
was so polluted by oil that it became flammable.
   A survey by a doctor at National Taiwan University Hospital
found symptoms of lead poisoning in half the 64 workers at a
battery recovery factory in Keelung port on the north coast.
Thirteen of 32 children at a nearby kindergarten suffered mental
retardation the doctor attributed to pollution from the plant.
   A chorus of protest began in 1987, when the lifting of martial
law after 38 years made demonstrations legal and allowed greater
freedom of expression.
   Many of the 7,500 demonstrations held since martial law ended
have had anti-pollution themes. Protesters have conducted hunger
strikes and dumped dead fish at the doors of government offices.
   Villagers have held lengthy sit-in blockades of several
factories accused of polluting the environment, forcing some plants
to close and others to pay compensation. Construction projects have
been delayed or halted because of the outcry, including important
petrochemical plants and power stations.
   Taiwan's largest conglomerate, Formosa Plastics Group, responded
to protests at the proposed site of an ethylene plant by saying it
might move some manufacturing facilties to mainland China.
   Officials say they fear hundreds of textile and plastic firms
that rely on the conglomerate's products might follow. The
government has announced plans to clean up state-run factories, but
there is concern that modernizing equipment at the aging plants may
not help much.
   The 10 major state-run companies, involved in oil refining,
power generation and steel and fertilizer production, have
announced plans to spened the equivalent of $3.4 billion on
pollution-control equipment in the next four years, nearly double
the figure for the previous four.
   Some private companies have other solutions. The China Gulf
Plastic Corp. in Miaoli, a northern city, has provided residents
with gas masks in case of a large chlorine emission.
   Environmentalists are not impressed with official efforts to
clean up.
   ``The government still gives top priority to economic
development,'' said Lin, the chemistry professor, who also heads
the Taiwan Environmental Protection Union.
   Critics of the government claim factories rarely are closed for
violating anti-pollution laws and are allowed to pay fines instead,
which are much cheaper than buying equipment to reduce pollution.
   Some environmentalists want the government to phase out
industries that cause the worst pollution. They say it might cause
a brief economic slowdown, but would boost the cleaner,
high-technology ventures officials view as a key to future
development.
   ``Environmental protection can go hand in hand with economic
development,'' said Shih, the National Taiwan University professor.
``They don't have to contradict each other.''

  In the nine o authorial voice. There's no narrator. ``In the
musical, Sondheim's lyrics and music are a narrative voice,
particularly the title song which echoes throughout the evening,''
Wager says. ``What Sondheim's score really did was to internalize
the experience, the ironic, pathetic, dramatic experience of the
Kaufman and Hart play. He gave an emotional response to it.''
   Two full drafts were written before the Arena production went
into rehearsals. They were complicated by the fact that Wager
severely tore ligaments in his leg just before rehearsals started
in New York. He did much of the rehearsals from a wheelchair or
using crutches.
   What the trio tried for was a much cleaner and simpler story,
making the reasons Franklin sold out much clearer and more
believable. And they pretty much succeeded, according to the
critics. While the reviews were mixed, the version done at Arena's
Kreeger Theater is likely to be the one that will be done in the
future by colleges, other regional theaters, community theaters and
amateur groups.
   ``Steve and George have decided that this is the version they
would like to see published, that the musical has finally found its
right shape and form,'' Wager says. ``And to me that could be no
greater reward.''

<HEAD>Arnold Schwarzenegger makes Directorial Debut on Television</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arnold Schwarzenegger has the muscle, so to
speak, to direct one of his own movies, but he didn't want to make
his debut on such a major project.
   Instead, he directed a 30-minute episode of ``Tales From the
Crypt'' for Home Box Office, which will be seen Saturday as part of
a trilogy of the ghoulishly witty series taken from the 1950s comic
book.
   ``Although you have a chance to walk into a top spot of
directing, because of where you are in your career, I didn't feel
comfortable with that,'' Schwarzenegger said.
   ``I wanted to start at the bottom, as I did in body building and
in acting,'' he said. ``I wanted to learn. I didn't want to start
out with a big movie and fall on my face.''
   Schwarzenegger's episode, ``The Switch,'' stars William Hickey
as a very rich, very old man who keeps swapping body parts with a
younger man to get a beautiful young woman to marry him. It also
stars Rick Rossovich and Kelly Preston.
   Richard Tuggle and Michael Taav wrote the script from a story
originally published in the ``Tales From the Crypt'' comic book.
   HBO's ``Tales From the Crypt'' has made it a practice to attract
hot directors or high-profile people looking for a chance to direct.
   Its directors have included Walter Hill (``48 HRS,'' ``Johnny
Handsome''), Robert Zemeckis (``Back To the Future,'' ``Romancing
the Stone''), Richard Donner (``The Omen,'' ``Superman''), Howie
Deutch (``Pretty In Pink''), Christopher Walas (``The Fly II''),
Richard Greenberg (``Little Monsters'') and Peter Seaman and
Jeffrey Price (writers of ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit?'').
   Hill, Zemeckis and Donner are among the series' executive
producers.
   ``The people at `Tales From the Crypt' were all friends of mine
and people I had worked with before,'' Schwarzenegger said. ``They
knew I was interested in directing. I'd been mentioning it for the
last two years.''
   Next, he said, he'd like to try his hand at directing a
television movie.
   His only previous experience with a TV movie _ and only dramatic
appearance on television _ was a role as Mickey Hargitay in the
1980 movie ``The Jayne Mansfield Story.''
   As for directing himself in a movie, Schwarzenegger smiled and
said, ``I don't know if I could handle directing myself. I'd have
to have some serious educational talks first with people who've
done it, like Clint Eastwood and Warren Beatty and Sylvester
Stallone.''
   The opportunity to direct came after he had completed ``Total
Recall,'' a $40 million-plus futuristic thriller filmed in Mexico
City, due out this summer.
   Schwarzenegger spoke in his office in a converted warehouse near
the beach in Venice. Behind his desk is one of seven identical
paintings of his wife, NBC newscaster Maria Shriver, done by Andy
Warhol. Pictures and mementos from such movies as ``Conan the
Barbarian,'' ``Red Heat,'' ``The Terminator,'' ``Commando,''
``Predator'' and ``Twins'' are everywhere.
   There also are pictures of President Bush with Schwarzenegger,
an active Republican supporter despite his marriage into the
Kennedy family. He also is chairman of the President's Council on
Physical Fitness and Sports.
   Did directing have any surprises for him?
   ``The biggest surprise was how tired I was at the end of the
day,'' Schwarzenegger said. ``My feet were almost falling off. I
was on my feet 15 hours a day, directing and choreographing scenes,
running to wardrobe, checking with special effects and working on
every aspect of the picture.
   ``After I saw it all put together I was surprised at how
important casting was. Each actor pulled off his part so well
because he was perfect for the role,'' he said.
   Schwarzenegger directed the episode in eight days with no
problems. But he had to call in help for the editing.
   ``I got it down to 31 minutes, but it had to be 26 minutes,'' he
said. ``You work so hard on those scenes you can't brutally cut
them. You have to step back and let someone who isn't as
emotionally involved come in and cut it. It made it a better show.''
   His next project is another comedy, ``Kindergarten Cop,'' with
Ivan Reitman, who directed ``Twins,'' at the helm.
   ``I've been wanting to do something with kids. I'm very good
with kids,'' said Schwarzenegger, who recently became a father with
the birth of Katherine Eunice. ``I play a tough cop who goes
undercover as a kindergarten teacher and finds that his iron
discipline doesn't work on the kids.''
   Despite the fact that he'll do ``Terminator II'' in the fall,
Schwarzenegger said his film roles have changed in recent years.
   ``It's a reflection of where my career started and where it's
going,'' he said. ``When you're struggling to get started, there
are only certain things the studios think you're capable of doing.
And only certain directors are willing to work with you.
   ``But when you successfully pull off certain roles, it gets more
interesting. You get offered better scripts and more creative
directors want to work with you. I don't have to pull off my shirt
and flex my muscles.''

<HEAD>Flag Burners, Flag Wavers Need Each Other</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Now that everybody has played out the
preliminary roles, the well-rehearsed political furor over flag
burning is headed into reruns. The first reprise is in the Supreme
Court, to be followed, depending on the script there, by another in
Congress.
   Everybody includes the flag burners themselves, a handful of
showoffs without whom the whole production would have closed by
now. But that would have been at the cost of a safe, showy
Republican campaign issue.
   Neither side in the political flag parade, wavers or burners,
could operate without the other.
   The next question to be settled is the constitutionality of a
law Congress passed last fall, making it a federal crime to burn
the American flag. The Supreme Court is going to hear arguments on
the issue on May 14, in time to make its decision by July.
   If that decision matches the ruling that started the whole
business last June, overturning a Texas law against flag burning,
Congress will make the next move, and there is little doubt that it
will be to approve an amendment to the Constitution to ban
desecration of the flag.
   That will take two-thirds votes in the House and Senate, then
three-quarters of the states to ratify the amendment. Those steps
would be a foregone conclusion, even in the judgment of opponents
who argue that the First Amendment should protect expressions of
dissent, no matter how offensive.
   The issue is too incendiary politically for many elected
officeholders, in either party, to vote in favor of leaving it
alone. So it has become an argument over how to ban flag burning.
   President Bush wanted a constitutional amendment in the first
place, saying he doubted there was any other way to ban flag
burning. Democratic congressional leaders said it could be done by
law, without constitutional tinkering, and they passed one,
including a provision for swift review by the Supreme Court. Bush
let it become law without his signature.
   On cue, the flag burning types reappeared, there being a reason
for somebody to pay attention to them again. They courted arrest by
burning flags at a federal building in Seattle and on the Capitol
steps in Washington. That provided the test cases they sought, and
federal judges in both cities held the law unconstitutional.
   That, in turn, led straight to the situation Bush and the
Republicans had forecast last summer, and revived the issue in time
for the 1990 election campaign.
   The interdependence of burners and banners is not the only irony
in the flag situation. The Justice Department is now making the
case for a law the administration argued against, on grounds that
it would not pass constitutional muster when it got back to the
Supreme Court. Lawyers for the Democrat-dominated Congress are on
the same side, urging the court to uphold the statute.
   Each side suspects the other of ulterior motives. The
administration sought and got speedy court review. Some Democrats
suspect that what the Republicans are looking for is a decision
that will overturn the law, reviving the issue for another Fourth
of July. Republicans accused the Democrats of trying to get the
whole thing delayed until fall, so that there wouldn't be a
decision before the November elections.
   Those suspicions boiled into debate late last month when lawyers
for the House told the court it should give the case priority in
the fall term, beginning next October. Republicans protested
bitterly, noting that the law passed last year, and asked the court
to expedite the review ``to the greatest extent possible.''
   The Democrats insisted that their lawyers had not tried to
shelve the issue but wanted ample time for full argument and
consideration because, according to Rep. Richard A. Gephardt, the
majority leader, ``we want the best possible chance of getting the
court to uphold this statute.''
   Republicans said it was a political dodge. ``You will not
deceive the American public,'' said Rep. Thomas J. Bliley Jr.,
R-Va. ``They know better and they will remember in November.''
   The court made those arguments moot when it decided to hear the
flag cases next month. But the House dispute, and the three roll
call votes that ended it, show the political power of the flag
issue.
   Republicans hoisted a resolution to withdraw the House brief
that suggested the court case wait until fall, and Democrats
deserted their own leaders on what became another series of flag
votes. The final vote was 309 to 101 to order withdrawal of the
legal brief the Democratic leadership had endorsed.

<HEAD>Volkswagon's Eye-Catching Corrado</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto, Graphic</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Think small, think fast and think agile when you think about the
1990 Volkswagen Corrado.
   This is a car that's small on the outside, surprisingly quick,
and an eye-catcher to boot.
   The Corrado marks something of a departure for Volkswagen, the
No. 1 carmaker in Europe. The car is designed, as Bill Young, vice
president in charge of VW-United States, put it, to change the way
you think about Volkswagen.
   Forget about the no-frills VWs of old. The Corrado is the first
to offer, at its initial debut in the market, a host of standard
features that would normally be optional on VW's: power windows,
air conditioning and heated outside mirrors. It's also the first VW
to have a tilt steering wheel.
   That's not all. The Corrado has a body by the same master
European coachbuilders who brought us the cute little Karmann Ghia
years ago _ plus a dashboard readout that details average fuel
economy, distance traveled and average speed just like the one you
would find in many luxury cars.
   Most impressively, the Corrado also is the quickest Volkswagen
ever, thanks to a special supercharger under the hood that spurs
the little four-cylinder engine up to 158 horsepower.
   Helping the performance, both in speed and fuel economy, is a
unique rear spoiler that rises automatically at 45 mph to help
ensure the car's speedy movement through air with a minimum of
rear-end lift. The spoiler begins to retract when speeds decline to
12 mph.
   The Corrado's sporty performance and well-packaged amenities
come at a base price of $17,900. Competitors include the Ford Probe
GT, which has a base price of $14,726; the Mitsubishi Eclipse GS
Turbo at $14,169, and the Toyota Celica GT-S at $16,268.
   One difference between the Corrado and many other competitors in
this segment, however, is the rear-seat room. VW says the Corrado's
rear seating area is a bit larger than most other, similar cars.
   Indeed, despite the test car's compact size _ a bit over 13 feet
long _ seating in back wasn't as bad as I feared. Though my view
was well-blocked by the front bucket seats and headrests and my
head brushed the ceiling, I found the sculpted seats to be very
comfortable, and legroom was OK with the front seat moved up a
ways. Legroom was at a minimum when the front seat was pushed all
the way back, although my knees still weren't touching the rear of
the front seats _ perhaps because the backs of the front bucket
seats were designed to slant inward.
   The rear seats are split one-third and two-thirds so they can be
folded down for more cargo space. But first, the rear center
armrest must be raised and set between the two front seats. Watch
when you replace the armrest in back so that you don't cover the
seat belt connectors.
   The Corrado also has a nice storage shelf that covers the hatch
area, if needed.
   The test car was fun to zip around in, and the power is
surprising. The car is rated at a quick 7.5 seconds for its 0-60
mph performance. Top speed is 140 mph.
   Yet the Corrado got good mileage, more than 24 mpg in mixed city
and highway driving during the test. The gearshift for the
five-speed manual transmission felt notchy but the transmission
worked well with the four-cylinder engine.
   The hatchback requires lifting items up and over the high rear
body of the car, and the storage space is raised slightly in the
middle, above the hidden spare tire compartment.
   The Corrado does not have airbags, but front-seat passengers do
get lap belts that automatically come across the body when the
ignition is activated.
   My complaints were minor: Having to use a large knob to recline
the bucket seats; a high-pitched squeak that seemed to come from
the lap belt connector on the driver side as I drove; no light in
the glovebox, and brake lights that stayed on for nearly a block as
I drove with a cold engine.
   VW has sold more than 2,000 of the cars since last fall's
introduction and hopes to sell 10,000 a year.
   Volkswagen looks to attract both younger and older single men
with this car. One target group has median age of 30 and median
household income of $40,000 a year, spokesman Val Brown said. The
second group has median age of 45 and household income of $75,000 a
year.
   In both groups, men are expected to predominate, with 75 percent
of buyers likely to be male, Brown said. Thirty-five percent will
be married, 70 percent will be college graduates and 65 percent
will be in upper white collar jobs.
   Because the Corrado is a new model, Consumer Reports magazine
does not list owner reports of trouble.

<HEAD>U.S. Farm Export Dream Still Includes China Despite Turmoil</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chinese market for American farm products
has been huge at times and doubtful at others. Right now, it may be
both.
   The Agriculture Department says China has been an erratic
customer. In the 1987-88 marketing year, for example, China bought
3.9 million metric tons of U.S. wheat. The following year's sales
jumped to a record 8.1 million tons, making China the biggest
foreign market for U.S. wheat.
   But sales dropped back to 5.7 million tons so far in 1989-90.
The wheat marketing year will end on May 31.
   Analyst Frederick Crook of the department's Economic Research
Service says agricultural reform for 10 years was the force behind
China's expanding economy. Now it's stalled.
   The student demonstrations in Tiananmen Square and the
government's bloody crackdown last June 4 prompted leadership
changes and political turmoil that have commanded Beijing's full
attention.
   ``Until the leadership question is resolved, very few further
changes will be made'' in China's rural policies, Crook said. Those
policies could have much to do with future U.S. commodity sales to
China and its 1.1 billion people.
   Last week Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin was named as new
chairman of the state Central Military Commission, replacing senior
leader Deng Xiaoping. Earlier, China's parliament _ the National
People's Congress _ accepted Deng's resignation from his last
official government post.
   Jiang, 63, is Deng's hand-picked successor, and in November
succeeded him as head of the party's Central Military Commission, a
key policy-making body with nearly the same membership as the state
group.
   Deng, 85, is still regarded as China's most powerful man and has
declared that Jiang is the ``core'' of next-generation leaders.
   Crook said in a recent issue of Farmline magazine that ``right
now, the country seems to be preoccupied with problems of the
transfer'' of power.
   China's economic reform began about 10 years ago under Deng,
with agriculture as its first phase. Crook said agricultural reform
was less complicated than in the urban sector because land
ownership was collective, the Communist Party constituency was not
as strong, and there were fewer opposing interests.
   The first phase of the reform shattered the commune system,
Crook said. There was little change in party organization, but
township governments, village committees elected by the people, and
economic cooperatives were organized.
   As the old communes were broken up, farmers were free to make
investments in new rural enterprises, including orchards, livestock
production, mining, milling and transportation.
   Crook said that as a result tens of millions of farmers found
work off the land. Since 1978, he said, an average of more than 1
million acres of cultivated land in China has been taken from
production each year and used for factories, housing, fish farms,
roads and railroads.
   The boom in rural housing has been immense, Crook said. On a
recent trip to China, he saw roads ``clogged with wagons full of
sand, lime and bricks.''
   Estimates show that between 1980 and 1988 rural people built
more than 500 million square yards of floor space annually, Crook
said. Rural housing space per capita doubled from 87 square feet in
1978 to 179 in 1988.
   ``At present, China's economy is stuck in neutral,'' he said.
``The partially reformed rural sector can't be developed further
until the urban economy is reformed.''
   But Crook added that since the Communist Party's main power base
is in the cities, urban reforms could threaten powerful economic
and political interests.
   Part of the urban reform agenda includes the decontrol of
marketing. And when this was undertaken with pork, eggs, vegetable
and fruit, consumer prices rose.
   Staples such as grain, vegetable oil and sugar remain under
Beijing's purchase-and-supply system, and retail prices have not
changed since the mid-1960s, he said. However, the government is
paying much more to buy these commodities, with costs rising to $7
billion in 1986 from $3.3 billion in 1978.
   Crook said government leaders are unhappy about the large food
subsidies for city people but are reluctant to make changes.
   Another major problem is price reform, he said. Often farmers
receive low prices for their products but must pay relatively high
prices for fertilizer, diesel fuel and consumer goods.
   Crook said he thinks future growth in China will be industrial
and that rural areas will see increases in processing and packaging
of farm products.
   China harvested a record 407.9 million tons of grain last year,
according to Beijing's estimates. That eclipsed the old high of
407.3 million tons in 1984, which was followed by four
disappointing harvests.
   But even with growth, China's grain production cannot keep up
with increases in population and per capita income. As families
prosper, consumer demand for meat increases. And China doesn't have
enough cropland for corn to feed expanded hog production.
   The government, in turn, is reluctant to spend scarce foreign
exchange to buy corn, Crook said. The United States is the world's
leading supplier of corn.
   ``It is difficult to foresee who will emerge as the powerful
leaders in this decade, and it is also difficult to forecast what
attitudes the new leadership will have regarding reforms,'' he said.

<DATELINE>SOUTH SAKKARA, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 4,200 years ago, Pharaoh
Pepy I heard one of his queens was plotting against him. He sent
Weni the Scribe to find out.
   Weni did. History didn't.
   Guilty or innocent? Cunning or faithful?
   Pepy's hapless queens have been suspects ever since.
   Now a French-Egyptian archaeological team, digging and recording
a queenly pyramid field 20 miles south of Cairo, is on its way to
unraveling one of ancient Egypt's most tantalizing intrigues.
   ``We have mention of three Pepy queens'' in ancient texts, ``and
now we have three burials,'' said Vassil Dobrev, a Bulgarian-born
Egyptologist on the team led by French historian Jean Leclant. ``As
we search on, we'll find the answers.''
   Which was the queen in question, and did she do it?
   Weni went to his grave with the secret, leaving a record of his
investigation that ended: ``I know the truth.''
   The scribe's silence did not enhance the pharaoh's reputation.
Pepy I, who died in 2255 B.C. after a 34-year reign, is remembered
for two things: an ability to keep Egypt's far-flung, troublesome
colonies in line and an inability to do the same with his queens.
   Early grave robbers, peasants revolting against the pharaohs and
generations of stone thieves left few clues to the alleged
conspiracy intact. The pyramids of Pepy's queens were so completely
ransacked that restorers work alongside archaeologists to minimize
the danger of falling walls.
   Generations of sycophantic tomb artists depicted ancient
Egyptian queens as perfect mates: beautiful, submissive, adoring.
   Egyptologist Zahi Hawass said the story of Pepy and his queen
shows that some ancient royal marriages were less than ideal,
especially since pharaohs had to deal with multiple wives and had
both major and minor queens.
   A pharaoh's chief queen, as consort of a god, received special
privileges, including the title ``great royal wife.'' Because of
the numerous other royal offspring, a young pharaoh-to-be often
married his sister to enhance his right to the throne.
   A few queens even managed to rule Egypt.
   ``We can understand the queens' importance by their tombs,''
said Hawass, who directs the pharaonic cemeteries of Giza and
Sakkara to the south. ``The largest was the pharaoh's tomb. After
all, he ruled Egypt. His tomb had to show that power.
   ``But directly after his tomb in size came the queens', then the
princes', then the nobles' and officials'; a cemetery easily shows
their ranks in life.''
   Allegations of a palace plot by a main queen was taken so
seriously that Weni was allowed inside the forbidden harem to
investigate the rumors. Hawass said Weni left no record of the
queen's name, referring to her only as a ``main consort'' of the
pharaoh.
   Until this dig, the only Pepy wives whose names were known were
Ankh-nes-meryre I and Ankn-nes-meryre II. Both were recorded by an
official named Khui, who said the king married two of his family
members. It is unlikely either sister would have been the main
queen because their blood wasn't royal enough.
   So who was the alleged plotter? Dobrev and his colleagues, who
are at the end of the dig for the season, hope the answer lies in
the third pyramid.
   The French-Egyptian expedition first came to South Sakkara, site
of the pyramids of Pepy I and his pharaoh sons Merenre and Pepy II,
in 1965.
   Its task was to record the last of the Old Kingdom's great
pyramid complexes on the edge of a 3-square-mile stretch of desert
graves spanning 3,000 years.
   Pepy I's pyramid proved particularly important because of
intricately carved texts of spells, rituals and myths designed to
help propel the soul of the dead pharaoh into the afterlife.
   For two decades, archaeologists were too busy to look for his
queens, but by 1988 high technology was available to help. Experts
combed 50 acres of rubble-strewn dunes adjacent to Pepy's pyramid
with ultrasound equipment developed in France.
   Soundings monitored by French technicians pinpointed two good
possibilities. The team started digging, and found two queens'
pyramids.
   A portion of a third pyramid was discovered last year, wedged
between the first two and roughly the same size, about 66 feet tall.
   Three pyramids. Three queens.
   Diggers began excavating the new pyramid early this year,
uncovering pottery shards, a chapel, a passageway and a burial
chamber.
   By the time digging ended March 28, there were two important
clues that could help solve the mystery of the accused queen.
   One was the name Nub-Unet on wall reliefs. The queen was unknown
to Egyptologists and may have been the royal wife Weni described.
She was buried in the eastern pyramid.
   The second clue was an empty basalt sarcophagus, its lid buried
beneath two massive boulders that once closed the burial chamber of
the middle pyramid.
   Dobrev hopes the lid, when uncovered, will bear the name of the
queen and something about her, but that is next season's work.
   Hawass thinks he knows what Weni the Scribe left unsaid about
Pepy's queen.
   ``Weni bragged that he alone investigated and he alone knew the
truth,'' the cemetery director said. ``He had solved the problem.
That's where the tale ends.
   ``I think Weni told Pepy his queen was not guilty, because Pepy
would never have allowed her to be buried next to him if she had
done something so evil.''

<HEAD>New Treatment Frees Bubble Children from Isolated Lives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUDIE GLAVE</BYLINE>

   Each night Shirley Dawson went to bed, unsure if
this would be the night the rare disease that had crippled her
sons' immune systems would take their lives.
   ``I was on guard 24 hours a day. If they would even cough at
night, I would jump up,'' she says. ``It was fear. We were always
living in fear.''
   The boys _ Dwayne, 15, and Leroy Jr., 12 _ are victims of severe
combined immunodeficiency disease, better known as ``boy in the
bubble'' disease after a SCID child who survived by living in a
sterile plastic bubble.
   Only 40 SCID children survive around the world; 13 of them live
in the United States; two of them live in the South Bronx, in the
Dawson household.
   But thanks to a new drug treatment that essentially replaces a
missing enzyme needed to fight common infections, the Dawsons sleep
easier, the years of worry relegated to painful memories.
   The boys' early years were marked by infections of every kind.
They received weekly blood transfusions and were stuck five, six,
seven times with needles. The prospect of each hospital visit made
them sick.
   They went to school, but were out more than they were in.
   ``Every night I went to bed not knowing _ would I find them
alive the next morning,'' Mrs. Dawson recalls. The emotional toll
was enormous.
   ``I felt trapped. I couldn't go anywhere. I couldn't dare think
of a family vacation, which was sorely needed,'' she said.
   Her husband, Leroy Sr., remembers working all day and spending
all night at the hospital, watching his children grow amid IV
tubes, oxygen lines and monitors.
   ``It was rough; trying to hold a job, worrying about the kids at
the same time,'' says Dawson, an electrician.
   Dwayne was diagnosed as having the disease when he was 18 months
old. ``He always had fevers, infections, they would just never go
away,'' Mrs. Dawson said. ``I knew something was terribly wrong.''
   Dwayne once spent nearly 10 months in isolation at a hospital.
He was released a week before Leroy Jr. was born, and lightning _
in the form of SCID _ struck twice.
   The Dawsons were prepared for that news. Amniocentesis, a
pernatal genetics test, had revealed the worst.
   When the results came back, in Mrs. Dawson's fifth month of
pregnancy, ``I thought I was gonna die. I could have, you know,
terminated it. But I didn't want that. I felt we would just deal
with it,'' she said.
   For nine years, they did. But then Enzon Inc., a small, South
Plainfield, N.J.-based biopharmaceutical company, developed what
its president jokingly refers to as ``our hairy enzyme.''
   Researchers believe SCID is caused by a lack of adenosine
deaminase, or ADA, an enzyme needed to stave off infection. The
enzyme is killed out of SCID patients in about a half hour.
   The treatment developed by Enzon, PEG-ADA, is basically an
enzyme with a hair-like protein attached which allows it to stay in
the bloodstream for up to a week.
   PEG-ADA, used experimentally since 1985, was approved by the
Food and Drug Administration on March 23. There are no known side
effects to the treatment, which costs about $60,000 yearly. The
Dawsons long ago exhausted their insurance, and Medicaid is paying
for the boys' treatments.
   PEG-ADA was developed with a $160,000 grant from the federal
``orphan'' drug program, which encourages companies to research
diseases afflicting fewer than 200,000 patients.
   Most SCID patients don't live in circumstances as extreme as the
boy in the bubble, but their immune systems cannot fight infections
as common as pneumonia and chicken pox; most have died before they
turned 2.
   To date, the only cure was bone-marrow transplants. Those who
could not find a suitable match had to be isolated.
   Abbey Myers, executive director of the National Organization for
Rare Disorders, applauds Enzon for researching a disease that
affects so few.
   ``These children can look forward to happy and healthy lives now
because Enzon took a risk,'' she says.
   A teaspoon of the clear enzyme, injected weekly into each of the
Dawson boys, has transformed their lives and the lives of their
parents.
   ``I feel like a whole different person,'' says Dwayne, who began
getting injections four years ago. ``I play more, can go out more
... I'm happier.'' His brother shyly adds, ``I just feel better.''
   Mrs. Dawson says she began seeing results ``almost
immediately.'' Researchers hope that some day, gene replacement
will cure SCID.
   But Mrs. Dawson says, ``I'll settle for this right now. The
torment is over.''

<HEAD>Authors Urge Would-be Environmentalists To Take First Step</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATTY REINERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TAKOMA PARK, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Relax, America. You can change your oil,
read the Sunday paper, wash your clothes and eat fast food _
without further endangering planet Earth.
   But beware. A trip to the supermarket may be more challenging
than ever.
   ``Every time you open your wallet, you're casting a vote for or
against the environment,'' said Joel Makower, a Washington-based
author who adapted the British edition of ``The Green Consumer''
for the U.S. market.
   ``The bad news is that so many things we do have a negative
effect on the environment,'' he said. ``The good news is that it
doesn't take a drastic change in lifestyle to help solve the
problem.''
   For would-be environmentalists, there is no shortage of
self-help guides, all of which have been released in time for the
20th anniversary of Earth Day, April 22. One is Diane MacEachern's
``Save Our Planet: 750 Everyday Ways You Can Help Clean Up The
Earth.''
   This year's theme is ``Who says you can't save the world?''
   ``I really believe that one person makes a difference,'' said
MacEachern, 37, of Takoma Park. ``I want this book to be a point of
departure for everyone sitting there saying `Global warming is
horrible, but where do I start?'''
   Makower's brand-specific guide explains how to look for
``green'' _ or environment-friendly _ groceries, gardening
supplies, home appliances and cars.
   ``Twenty years ago, the idea of green consumerism was a
contradiction in terms. It meant you couldn't buy anything,''
Makower said. ``But now so many companies have spent millions of
dollars in an effort to appeal to consumers who are willing to take
environmental matters into their own hands.
   ``The products are out there,'' he said. ``You just have to know
what to look for.''
   For example, ``The Green Consumer'' recommends checking boxes of
cereal, cake mix and laundry detergent to see if they are made of
recycled cardboard.
   Makower also suggests buying in bulk, choosing glass over
plastic, avoiding over-packaged foods and putting fruits and
vegetables directly in the shopping cart rather than in plastic
bags.
   And at the check-out counter, the question, ``Paper or plastic''
should be answered, ``Neither.'' Even paper takes up precious
landfill space before it biodegrades, and most grocery bags are
made of virgin paper, rather than recycled paper, for added
strength.
   The green consumer shops for groceries with a reusable cloth bag.
   Makower predicts that the ``E-factor'' soon will be as important
a consideration as price, quality and convenience in today's
environmentally conscious marketplace.
   According to a 1989 survey by the Michael Peters Group, a New
York-based marketing firm, 89 percent of the 1,000 adults
questioned said they are concerned about the environmental effects
of products they buy. Seventy-eight percent said they would pay
more for items in recyclable packages and 53 percent said they had
boycotted products for environmental reasons.
   ``People are starting to realize that we can't wait for industry
or government or technology to do it for us,'' Makower said. ``We
helped cause these problems and we have to help solve them.''
   MacEachern says novice environmentalists can start just about
anywhere.
   ``The public sometimes doesn't understand the chain reaction _
the interconnectedness of everything,'' she said. ``But they start
doing one thing _ like conserving energy by shutting off their
lights when they don't need them. And when they see that their
utility bills have gone down, then they say, `Why don't I try to
save water?' ... and pretty soon it's just automatic.''
   Among MacEachern's suggestions:
   _Weatherize your home. As much energy leaks through American
windows every year as flows through the Alaskan pipeline.
   _Plant trees. The American Forestry Association says that one or
two trees shading a central air conditioning unit can increase
efficiency by 10 percent.
   _Eat at home. If you eat at fast-food restaurants, refuse the
Styrofoam packaging. It is made with chlorofluorocarbons, which
destroy the earth's protective ozone layer.
   _Plant an organic garden and avoid pesticides.
   _Refuse to buy products harmful to the environment, recycle what
you do buy and reuse what you can't recycle. Each year, Americans
throw away 18 billion disposable diapers, 1.7 billion pens, 2
billion razors and 220 million tires.

<HEAD>Researcher Says Children of Smoking Mothers Have Greater Cancer
Risk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SHARP</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fetal hamsters exposed indirectly to a
carcinogen show a high rate of cancer in middle age, according to
research findings that imply a similar risk for the children of
mothers who smoke cigarettes.
   The findings of Dr. Hildegard M. Schuller apparently are the
first to show the development of cancer in hamster offspring whose
mothers are injected with a carcinogen known by the abbreviation
NNK.
   The hamsters are not born with cancer, Schuller said.
   ``When born they are completely normal in weight and size, and
their development is normal. But when they're 1 year old a very
high percentage have developed tumors in various organs,'' said
Schuller, professor of pathobiology and chief of the experimental
oncology lab at the University of Tennessee's College of Veterinary
Medicine.
   Depending upon the dose of NNK, one of a family of chemicals
known jointly as nitrosamines, up to 70 percent of the fetuses
developed cancerous tumors. A hamster a year old is roughly
equivalent to a person 40 to 45 years old, she said.
   Schuller has spent three years researching the transmission of
carcinogens through the placenta of hamsters to their fetuses. A
report on her findings has been accepted for publication later this
year in the journal of the American Association for Cancer Research.
   Pelayo Correa, a professor of pathology at Louisiana State
University, said previous studies have shown NNK can be transferred
through the placenta to a fetus.
   But, ``if (Schuller) is finding these animals develop more
cancer than others, that is a new finding,'' said Correa, who has
done statistical research on the incidence of cancer in children
based on whether their parents smoke.
   ``There was a suspicion that might happen, but nobody had found
it before,'' he said.
   NNK, Schuller said, is formed in the tobacco curing process and
is found in all cigarettes. It is structurally similar to nicotine,
she said.
   No tumors were found in a control group of hamsters not
receiving NNK injections. She said hamsters were used in the
research because their organs and tissues closely resemble those of
humans.
   The tumors occurred in the lungs and upper respiratory tract,
nasal cavity, adrenal glands, pancreas and liver.
   ``Even with one single injection we still have a highly
significant instance of cancer developing in the offspring,''
Schuller said. But, she said, ``it's close to impossible to show''
whether NNK specifically causes cancer in humans.
   The National Institutes of Health recently awarded Schuller a
three-year, $371,675 grant to continue her research.
   She said she now will vary the dosages and delivery of NNK into
pregnant animals.
   ``We're trying to see whether there is such a thing as a safe
dose,'' she said. ``The lowest dose levels we're tested in the last
three years translate into sombody smoking 10 to 15 packs of
cigarettes a day. That is very high, I realize.''
   She said the doses are large because the gestation period of a
hamster is just 60 days, so researchers use high doses to simulate
what a human fetus might be exposed to over nine months when the
mother smoked every day.
   Schuller said she also is pursuing how cancer-causing chemicals
penetrate the placenta and get into fetal tissue, the nature of the
chemical changes that make the cancer-causig chemicals and how the
process can be prevented, and how ethanol, the alcohol found in
wine, liquor and beer, affects the process.

<HEAD>Easter Egg Decorating Should Be Done with an Eye to Safety</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY MacVEAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fears of salmonella and cholesterol needn't
scramble Easter egg decorating plans, if eggs are handled properly
and eaten sparingly.
   The Blue Bird Circle, a Texas organization that has sold
hand-painted Easter eggs for 66 years, is taking no chances. It
canceled this year's sale on the advice of its lawyers, who worried
children would eat spoiled eggs and get sick.
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends that eggs hidden
for an egg hunt be prepared carefully to make sure that there are
no cracks in the shells and that they are protected from dirt, pets
and other sources of bacteria.
   Hard-cooked eggs eventually will spoil, and should not be left
at room temperature for more than two hours if they are to be
eaten, USDA said.
   If possible, buy eggs a week or so before hard cooking them. In
very fresh hard-cooked eggs, the white may stick to the membrane
lining the shell, making them all but impossible to peel.
   Much of the recent worry has concerned raw eggs, in such dishes
as caesar salad, or lightly cooked eggs. Blowing raw eggs for
decorating could pose a slight risk because of the possibility of
ingesting bacteria. If you don't plan to eat the eggs, wash the
shell.
   If a raw egg shell is cracked, bacteria on the shell could enter
the egg.
   Scientists also suspect that certain salmonella bacteria can be
transmitted from an infected hen directly to the egg interior.
While the extent of the problem is not known, the risk of illness
remains small, according to the USDA.
   In February, the agency announced a $6.8 million program to help
curb the spread of salmonella enteritidis by testing and certifying
breeding flocks that produce table-egg layers and tracing and
testing flocks if they are implicated in human cases of salmonella
enteritidis.
   The problem in the nation's $3.2 billion egg industry emerged in
the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states, but has spread to the
Midwest and Northwest.
   The bacteria can cause cramps, diarrhea, fever, nausea and
vomiting. The elderly and those with compromised immune systems
could suffer serious and life-threatening effects.
   Last year, salmonella poisoning struck more than 1,600 people
and killed 13, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control said.
Contaminated food was implicated in 64 percent of the outbreaks,
and 73 percent of those involved eggs.
   Gourmet and Food &amp; Wine magazines have stopped publishing
recipes using raw or slightly cooked eggs.
   ``We thought it more judicious because so many people entertain
from our magazines and it would be terrible if someone were to
become ill,'' said Zanne Zakroff, food editor at Gourmet, where the
new policy should be completely in effect by the August issue.
   As for cholesterol, a large egg has an average of 213
milligrams. The American Heart Association recommends 300
milligrams or less per day over several days, or about three or
four egg yolks, which contains the cholesterol, a week.
   From the USDA:
   _ Buy eggs from a refrigerated display case, and only those with
clean uncracked shells. Check the expiration date. Don't use eggs
with cracked or stained shells.
   _ Store eggs in the refrigerator at home. Temperatures below 40
degrees help slow the loss of moisture from the eggs and inhibit
the growth of most bacteria that cause food-borne illness.
   _ Don't wash eggs. Most eggs sold commercially have been washed
and sprayed with oil. Washing them can remove the protective oil
and enable bacteria to penetrate the porous shell.
   _ Raw eggs will keep in the refrigerator about three weeks
without significant loss of quality. Separated whites and yolks
should be stored in covered containers and used within four days.
Hard-cooked eggs should be eaten within a week.
   _ Wash hands, cooking surfaces and all equipment that come in
contact with eggs to prevent cross-contamination. Even if
contamination in an egg is counteracted in cooking, the bacteria
could be spread by the hands, for example.
   _ Thoroughly cook eggs and egg-rich dishes. Eggs generally are
sufficiently cooked if the yolks and whites are not runny or if
they are used in a baked food. Most harmful bacteria grow at
temperatures of 40 to 140 degrees. Most are destroyed at 160
degrees or higher, the USDA said.

<HEAD>Tests Show Gulf Dolphins May Have Been Hit by Pneumonia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASCAGOULA, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tests suggest pneumonia may have played
a part in the recent deaths of hundreds of dolphins in the Gulf, a
marine biologist said.
   Gerald Regan, a marine biologist at Spring Hill College in
Mobile, Ala., received test results on the first four bottlenose
dolphins found dead in Alabama, and pneumonia was found in three of
the samples.
   The fourth sample was too decomposed, Regan said recently.
   Regan said this is the first sign of a cause of death among more
than 200 dolphins that have washed up on beaches along the Gulf of
Mexico.
   Regan said he noticed irregularities in the dead dolphins'
lungs, and sent them off to be tested. He said the tests do not
tell if the pneumonia was viral or bacterial, or if it actually
caused death.
   ``We don't know what all of this means. The conclusions are far
from clear,'' Regan said.
   Because of the high number of deaths, the federal government
ordered a temporary halt to the capture of dolphins in the Gulf.
Dolphins are often captured for research.
   Theories on the deaths have ranged from excessive cold in late
December to the presence of algal bloom or red tides.

<HEAD>Asthma Drug Restricted</HEAD>

   The Oregon Board of Pharmacy has voted to
restrict sales of an asthma medication because of concerns it was
being used as a stimulant and as a methamphetamine ingredient.
   The 5-0 vote means ephedrine tablets and capsules will be
available in Oregon only by prescription beginning as early as this
month.
   The board's action last month also means increased costs for at
least some of the estimated 130,000 to 260,000 Oregonians who have
asthma. Those who buy ephedrine will have to bear the higher costs
for handling by a pharmacist.
   Drug investigators told the board the tablets were being used in
methamphetamine labs.
   Police Detective Jim Bellah said officers found 19,000 ephedrine
tablets at a methamphetamine lab in Vancouver, Wash.
   The state of Washington previously restricted ephedrine sales so
that tablets and capsules are available by prescription only, and
Idaho, Arizona and California are considering similar controls,
according to board President George Gerding.

   U.S. and Japanese negotiators, weary after
three days of marathon talks, struggled to clear up differences on
an unprecedented agreement attacking the huge trade imbalance
between the two economic superpowers.
   Both sides insisted Wednesday that good progress was being made
in the negotiations, but U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said
Japan must make further concessions or risk a backlash in this
country.

   Trustees of New York City and California pension
funds said Exxon Corp.'s chairman wouldn't immediately agree to
their suggestions for preventing environmental accidents but
planned to respond to them in coming weeks.
   Officials of the funds, which are some of Exxon's biggest

about the impact on the company's earnings from accidents like last
year's disastrous Alaska oil spill.

   The recent turmoil in Japan's financial markets
has left its mark on U.S. mutual fund investors.
   A tally of the best- and worst-performing mutual funds released
Wednesday by Lipper Analytical Services Inc. said eight of the 10
biggest losers during the first quarter were invested heavily in
Japanese companies.
   The big winners were investments in science and high technology.
Several specialty funds also did well.
   But overall, stock and bond funds posted negative performances
during the first three months of 1990, according to Lipper. The
average total return of general equity funds was a negative 2.31
percent, following a 1.21 percent drop the previous quarter.
Fixed-income fund performance was a negative 1.40 percent in the
first quarter.
   By comparison, the Dow Jones industrial average of 30 blue-chip
stocks was down 0.69 percent and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index
lost 3.01 percent in the first quarter, assuming reinvestment of
dividends.
   A. Michael Lipper, the firm's president, called the decline
``comforting rather than frightening,'' and said general stock
funds in particular had far exceeded the typical 10 percent annual
growth rate of recent years. From late 1974 to the end of the first
quarter these funds grew by an average 16.5 percent, he said.
   ``We take great comfort in that the short-term declines are
bringing intermediate-term rates of gain back down to historic
trends,'' Lipper said.
   The same may not be true for Japan-oriented funds, which
historically have produced a number of money-making standouts in
tandem with Japan's strong economic growth, according to the Lipper
tally. These funds, classified primarily as Pacific region funds,
lost an average 13.18 percent in the first quarter, according to
Lipper.
   The Nikko Japan Tilt Fund showed the worst performance, down
29.90 percent, followed by SLH Investment: Pacific, off 21.43
percent. Another big loser, GT Global Growth: Japan, which declined
13.67 percent, had been the fourth best performer in 1989, gaining
60.73 percent.
   The losses in these funds coincide with a nearly 25 percent
plunge in Japan's stock market during the first quarter, due partly
to rising Japanese interest rates, and with a nearly 8 percent
decline by the yen against the dollar.
   The other big mutual fund losers were gold-oriented funds, which
fell 6.93 percent and financial services, off 5.46 percent.
   Performance figures in Lipper's rankings of 1,747 continuing
funds for the quarter assume that investors reinvest all dividends
and capital gains distributions paid by the funds.
   Funds investing primarily in science and high-technology
companies were up 2.6 percent. Those funds and European region
funds, up 0.82 percent, were the only categories showing growth in
the first quarter, according to Lipper.
   Lipper said the high-tech funds rebounded from a weak
performance in 1989, when technology companies suffered from
overcapacity and weak prices for their products.
   The top high-tech fund was Fidelity Select Electronics, which
gained 17.03 percent.
   The biggest comeback was the Strategic Gold-Minerals fund, which
was the top performing fund in the first quarter with a 19.15
percent gain. That fund was the worst performer for all of 1989,
declining 17.75 percent.
   Lipper attributed the turnaround to a sharp rise in the stock
price of Akiko-Lori, a Canadian gold mineral company in which the
fund is heavily invested.
   At the same time, Strategic Investments _ the third-best
performer for all of 1989 with a 61.25 percent rate of return _ was
the third biggest loser in the first quarter, down 21.10 percent.

<HEAD>Bonwit Teller Name to Live on _ Though Most Existing Stores Won't</HEAD>

   The Bonwit Teller name, one of the oldest in
U.S. retailing, will survive but most department stores in the
existing chain are going out of business.
   A big Northeast shopping mall developer intends to rebuild and
expand the chain starting with the purchase of Bonwit Teller stores
in Boston and Buffalo, N.Y., from the current owner, which is in
bankruptcy proceedings.
   Under agreements announced in bankruptcy court Wednesday, Bonwit
Teller's parent L.J. Hooker Corp. will break up the chain and sell
portions of it piecemeal. L.J. Hooker already liquidated its B.
Altman &amp; Co. retail chain as part of its reorganization.
   Judge Tina Brozman, who has been overseeing Hooker's Chapter 11
bankruptcy proceedings, indicated she will endorse the agreements.
   L.J. Hooker attorney Sheldon Hirshon said at a hearing that the
company would have liked to sell as much of the Bonwit chain as
possible as a going concern, but a potential bid for 13 of the 16
stores failed to materialize in time.
   Hirshon told the court that Hooker accepted a $22 million bid
from a consortium of investors, including an entity controlled by
real estate developer Donald Trump, for 5 stores in Boston,
Buffalo, New York City, Manhasset, N.Y., and Short Hills, N.J.
   The group will close Bonwit's flagship store in Manhattan's
Trump Tower as well as the Manhasset and Short Hills branches.
   Consortium member Pyramid Cos., a shopping mall developer and
owner based in Syracuse, N.Y., will run the Boston and Buffalo
stores under the Bonwit Teller name. Also, Pyramid affiliate Bontel
Corp. will have rights to the Bonwit Teller name and plans to open
additional stores in the future.
   Robert J. Congel, Pyramid's managing partner, said the company
would open a new flagship store in Manhattan as part of a plan to
rebuild the chain. He said Pyramid is seeking a prime location on
Fifth Avenue.
   ``We look forward with great anticipation to rebuilding and
revitalizing Bonwit Teller,'' he said.
   Over the next three to five years, Pyramid plans to open Bonwit
Tellers in its retail complexes in Providence, R.I., Rockland
County, N.Y., Harrisburg, Pa., and Albany, N.Y. The first new
Bonwit Teller will be opened in October in Carousel Center, a
complex Pyramid is building in Syracuse.
   Other members of the consortium are Trump Equitable Fifth Ave.
Corp., owner of the commercial space in Trump Tower; Pilevsky
Group, a New York property owner, and Prutaub, a venture that
operates the Mall At Short Hills.
   The other Bonwit Teller stores that will continue operating are
in Cincinnati and Columbia, S.C. Hooker intends to keep those
running because they are located in Hooker-owned malls and closing
them could hurt mall business.
   Hooker accepted four separate bids to buy the leases for the
Bonwit Tellers in Chicago, Oak Brook, Ill., Palm Beach, Fla., and
Troy, Mich. All those stores will be closed.
   There were no acceptable bids for leases on the stores in Bal
Harbour, Fla., Kansas City, Mo., Philadelphia, Jenkintown, Pa., and
Scarsdale, N.Y.
   At a May 18 hearing, Hooker will try to dispose of the rest of
the Bonwit Teller estate including the remaining store leases, the
corporate offices in New York and the distribution center in
Totowa, N.J.
   Hirshon, the Hooker attorney, said the company promised to
vacate all Bonwit premises by June 30.
   Bonwit Teller's roots go back to the 1880s when Paul J. Bonwit
formed a partnership with Edmund D. Teller. The New York-based
retailer they began built a reputation over the years as an upscale
store specializing in women's fashions.
   But in recent years the chain has run into trouble, partly
because of stiff competition from smaller specialty apparel stores
and a generally sluggish retail environment. The company has
struggled financially since its acquisition by Atlanta-based L.J.
Hooker in 1987.
   Bonwit Teller lost $2 million on revenue of $149 million in 1988
and lost $6 million on revenue of $158 million in 1989. For the
year ended Jan. 31, Bonwit Teller appears to have lost about $21
million on $168 million in revenue, according to preliminary
figures from L.J. Hooker.
   The company's corporate parent, Hooker Corp., is based in
Australia. This past summer it went into ``provisional
liquidation,'' an Australian legal proceeding similar to
bankruptcy. L.J. Hooker filed for protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Act in August.

   The Bonwit Teller retail chain, owned by L.J.
Hooker Corp., operates 16 specialty department stores in 10 states.
   Under terms of agreements announced Wednesday in bankruptcy
court in New York, a dozen of the existing stores will go out of
business. The dates of liquidation sales have not been determined.
   Pyramid Cos., a Syracuse, N.Y., real estate development and
investment company, is part of a consortium which was awarded five
stores.
   Pyramid plans to continue operating the Bonwit Tellers in Boston
and Buffalo, N.Y., and rebuild the chain at new sites, mainly
within retail complexes it owns or plans to develop. The consortium
will close the other three existing Bonwit Tellers.
   Among consortium members are Trump Equitable Fifth Avenue Corp.,
the entity that owns the commercial space in Manhattan's Trump
Tower and is controlled by tycoon Donald Trump; Pilevsky Group, a
New York real estate owner; and Prutaub, a venture that operates
the Mall at Short Hills in New Jersey.
   L.J. Hooker also accepted several bids for the leases on various
other stores plus the liquidation value of the inventory. Those
stores will not continue operating as Bonwit Tellers.
   Here is a list of all 16 existing Bonwit Teller stores, their
locations, and whether they will stay in business or close:
   _Flagship store in Trump Tower, New York. This store was one of
five bought by the investment consortium, which plans to close it.
   _Bal Harbour, Fla., store in The Fashion Center, will be closed.
   _Boston store on Boylston Street, included in the package bought
by the consortium. It will be run by Pyramid.
   _Buffalo store in suburban Walden Galleria Shopping Center,
included in the package bought by the consortium. It will be run by
Pyramid.
   _Chicago store on North Michigan Avenue will be closed.
   _Cincinnati store in Forest Fair Mall, which is owned by Hooker,
will continue operating.
   _Columbia, S.C. store in Richland Fashion Mall, which is owned
by Hooker, will continue operating.
   _Jenkintown, Pa., store in Foxcroft Square Pavillon will be
closed.
   _Kansas City, Mo., store in Country Club Plaza will be closed.
   _Manhasset, N.Y. store in the Miracle Mile, included in the
consortium's package, will be closed.
   _Oak Brook, Ill., store in Oakbrook Center will be closed.
   _Palm Beach, Fla., store on Worth Avenue will be closed. The
site will be used by the company that bought the lease on the
Bonwit Teller property, Frances Brewster Inc., an upscale Florida
men's and women's retailer.
   _Philadelphia store on Chestnut Street will be closed.
   _Scarsdale, N.Y., store in the Vernon Hills Shopping Center will
be closed.
   _Short Hills, N.J., store in the Mall at Short Hills, included
in the consortium package, will be closed.

   Sales of North American-made vehicles rose 2.9
percent in late March as better sales at General Motors Corp.
offset declines at Ford and Chrysler while Japanese automakers made
strong gains.
   GM's vehicle sales during the period rose 6.1 percent while
sales for Ford Motor Co. declined 3.8 percent and Chrysler Corp.'s
fell 16.6 percent.
   Combined car and truck sales for the nine major U.S. automakers
rose to a daily average of 43,688 in late March, compared with an
average of 42,451 during the same period last year, the companies
said Wednesday.
   Car sales were up 2.7 percent and light-truck sales rose 3.2
percent.
   Sales in the year-earlier period were relatively soft.
Nevertheless, GM's increase was significant because it followed a
prolonged period of declining market share, said auto analyst Scott
Merlis of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. of New York.
   ``The real story here, as we end the first quarter, is that a
new trend has developed and GM is a market-share gainer,'' he said.
   GM's share of the domestic car market in late March stood at
45.1 percent, up from 44.6 percent during the same period last
year. Ford's share dropped to 26.5 percent from 29.6 percent and
Chrysler tumbled to 9.7 percent from 13 percent.
   GM's gains were modest, though, alongside those made by
Japanese-owned plants in the U.S. The so-called transplants took
18.7 percent of the domestic market in late March, up from 12.8
percent a year earlier.
   GM's car sales rose 3.9 percent in late March, and much of the
overall gain came from a 10.9 percent increase in light truck
sales, including the company's new minivans.
   On March 22, GM began offering $1,000 rebates on the company's
trio of new minivans _ the Chevrolet APV, Pontiac Trans Sport and
Oldsmobile Silhouette. GM's share of the domestic light truck
market in late March rose to 40.5 percent from 37.7 percent while
Ford's and Chrysler's shares dropped to 33.8 percent and 20.3
percent, respectively.
   In January, Chrysler offered a similar rebate on its minivans,
the most popular in the industry, and sales soared. But since that
incentive expired Jan. 31, sales have dropped off.
   Despite the apparent incentive-spurred boost in GM's truck
sales, underlying consumer demand appears to be strengthening,
Merlis said.
   ``There's some real underlying consumer demand there,'' he said.
   If he's right, the demand is just beginning to show up. Car and
truck sales for all of March and for the first quarter of 1990 are
lagging behind last year's pace.
   Combined domestic and imported car and truck sales of 1,271,465
vehicles last month was 3.1 percent lower than in March 1989. For
the first quarter of 1990, sales were 1.8 percent behind last
year's pace.
   Drawing firm conclusions about trends in vehicle sales based on
one 10-day reporting period can be misleading since a variety of
factors, including incentives and even weather, can affect sales.
   But, Merlis said, there's reason to wonder whether the sales
slump that began in October as the 1990 model year got under way is
at an end.
   ``If sales can continue at this rate next month, that would be
very encouraging from a consumer standpoint and in terms of a
general recovery,'' he said.
   Robert Rewey, Ford's vice president for sales, took a similar
view.
   ``We expect the second half (of the year) to be somewhat
stronger than the first, assuming a pickup in economic growth from
its present sluggish pace,'' he said.

   Here are sales results for the nine major U.S.
automakers for the third period of March 1990.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals.
There were 10 selling days in the period this year and 10 selling
days last year.
   For the month, there were 27 selling days this year and 27
selling days last year, and for the year so far, 77 selling days
this year and 76 selling days last year.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota, Mazda, Subaru and Mitsubishi are counted as domestic and
appear in this table. Subaru began producing cars in September at a
joint venture plant in Lafayette, Ind.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and
Chrysler names are counted as foreign.

<HEAD>Restructuring Seen As Strengthening Baxter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Baxter International Inc. will emerge a stronger
player in the medical supply business after paring its workforce by
10 percent and shedding a fifth of its plants, according to
industry analysts.
   Baxter announced those cuts Wednesday as part of a restructuring
that also includes the sale of several marginal businesses and
creation of a separate division for diagnostic products, part of
which it may sell to the public.
   Industry analysts said the cost-cutting measures were long
overdue following years of belt-tightening in the medical industry
as providers have striven to contain health-care costs.
   ``Hospitals have been pushed up against the wall in terms of the
cost cuts they've had to make and that's affecting the suppliers to
the hospitals as well,'' said Jerry Fuller of Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. in
Chicago.
   Analyst Joseph Francis of Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. said
the austerity measures, while unexpectedly severe, were ``very
positive'' for Baxter's future.
   ``What will emerge is a much leaner company in a very
competitive market,'' Francis said. ``This should dramatically
improve their earnings power.''
   Baxter said that over the next three years it plans to lay off
about 6,400 of its 64,300 employees and close or sell 21 of its
approximately 100 manufacturing plants in 24 countries, including
46 in the United States.
   Spokesman Geoffrey Fenton would not identify the plants slated
for closure but said Baxter already has begun to notify those that
will be affected.
   ``These decisions are in the best long-term interests of all of
our constituencies,'' Chairman Vernon R. Loucks Jr. said in a
statement.
   ``Baxter must keep evolving to help its customers meet their
objective of providing high-quality health care while controlling
costs,'' Loucks said.
   The company also said it planned to raise prices on many
products and channel more money into research and development.
   Baxter, based in the Chicago suburb of Deerfield, said it would
post a first-quarter net loss of $375 million to $400 million, or
$1.50 to $1.60 a share, after taking a pre-tax charge of $566
million for the restructuring.
   The company said the changes will generate annual pre-tax
savings of up to $275 million by 1993 and help Baxter achieve
annual growth of 15 to 18 percent in operating income over the next
several years.
   Baxter boosted profits by 15 percent last year to $446 million
on sales of $7.4 billion.
   The company's common stock fell 25 cents Wednesday to $24.37{ a
share on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Fenton said the layoffs included 500 people already cut from the
corporate headquarters staff.
   He declined to identify the manufacturing businesses that Baxter
intends to sell, saying arrangements had not been completed. He
said Baxter may continue to distribute products of those businesses
even if it no longer owns them.
   Baxter said the businesses to be sold had total sales of about
$140 million last year.
   The company said it will establish a separate subsidiary for its
diagnostics-products business and is considering selling a minority
interest in the subsidiary to the public. Diagnostics accounted for
$1.4 billion of Baxter's sales last year.
   The company said it was committed to diagnostics products and to
in-home health care, a growing market that Baxter latched onto via
its 1987 acquisition of Caremark Inc.
   Caremark was heralded last year for innovation as the sole
distributor of clozapine, a schizophrenia drug that the company
delivers to patients' homes weekly. The company also monitors the
patients for potentially toxic side effects of the drugs.
   Despite such innovations, Baxter's core business remains the
manufacture of basic hospital supplies _ gowns, intravenous
solutions and surgical supplies _ and the distribution of
healthcare products manufactured by others, said James Fenger, an
analyst who follows the company for Kemper Financial Services Inc.
   Baxter said its latest moves were consistent with the strategic
plan it has been pursuing since it acquired the American Hospital
Supply Corp. in 1985 and Caremark.

<HEAD>Bank Says It Will Cut 5,600 Jobs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bank of New England Corp. is cutting 5,600 workers
and slashing $300 million in costs, but the troubled company admits
that even with the cuts its future is in doubt.
   The bank, operating under government orders for more than a
month, announced the cost-cutting plan Wednesday. But the
institution also filed federal documents this week saying it
expects to see an increase in troubled loans.
   Furthermore, the bank acknowledged its future may hinge on
whether the slumping New England economy continues to decline.
   ``Continued deterioration in the New England economy and the
real estate market could adversely impact the corporation's
recovery efforts,'' the bank said.
   The job reductions, which will lower the workforce by about
one-third, will come through a combination of layoffs, attrition
and asset sales. The bank also has frozen hiring, eliminated
financial bonuses and suspended raises for bank officers.
   Analysts said that although the moves should strengthen the
bank, its footing remains extremely shaky.
   The bank gave a similar assessment in documents filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission this week.
   ``If the corporation is unsuccessful in addressing the
corporation's current difficulties, it is likely that external
assistance from third parties and@or regulatory authorities will be
required,'' the bank said.
   Bank of New England lost more than $1 billion last year, due
largely to bad real estate loans.
   The bank said that in addition to $2.2 billion in non-performing
assets reported at the end of 1989, it had $1 billion in loans that
were still performing but where borrowers were experiencing some
financial difficulty.
   The bank said it expects non-performing assets will increase in
the first quarter.
   That could be a sign that problems could be spreading outside
the bank's real estate portfolio into other business loans, said
Gerard Cassidy, an analyst with Tucker Anthony Inc.
   ``The key is the economy,'' he said. ``The New England economy
is not cooperating.''
   The bank said it would lay off about 1,700 employees and would
notify them over the next several days.
   ``These decisions were difficult and they are painful for all of
us,'' bank Chairman Lawrence K. Fish said in a letter to employees.
   ``But difficult as these steps are, it is essential that we take
them now to assure our future viability and our ability to rebuild
as a stronger, though smaller, Bank of New England,'' he said.
   ``At the same time, our primary concern as we rebuild is
customer service and maintenance of the highest possible credit
quality,'' Fish said.
   An earlier staff reduction plan was canceled by Fish after he
was named chairman on March 9. At the time, he ordered a thorough
review of the organization's direction, structure, and personnel
needs.
   Personnel cuts, asset sales and other measures are expected to
reduce annual operating expenses by approximately $300 million, the
bank said.
   Bank officials said the action was being taken as part of a
strategic plan outlining new directions for the corporation.
Details of the plan are expected next week.
   The bank last month announced it had signed federal orders that
set tight guidelines for lending practices and other operations.
   James Moynihan, senior vice president of Advest Inc. in Boston,
predicted the bank eventually will sell off all its subsidiaries in
Connecticut, Maine and Rhode Island.
   ``In order to survive, they will have to become a
Massachusetts-only bank,'' he said. The results, if successful,
would be a ``very competitive bank'' with assets below $20 billion,
compared with a $32 billion level last year.
   The bank said its new strategic plan will try to concentrate on
primary banking and lending businesses.
   Other operations will be eliminated, including processing
services, large corporate banking outside of New England, leasing
and discount brokerage services.
   The bank also disclosed that it was being sued in federal court
in Pennsylvania by the Penn Mutual Life Insurance Co., which has a
$10 million, 14 percent Bank of New England bank note due in 1996.
   Penn Mutual maintains the bank's asset sales breached covenants
in the note. The insurance company asked the court to order the
bank to speed up its principal payments.
   The bank also faces a lawsuit from shareholders who claim
company executives misrepresented the bank's financial status by
not disclosing the mounting troubles sooner last year.

<HEAD>Bill Would Merge Wall Street, LaSalle Street Watchdogs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Proposed legislation to end the turf battle
between the federal agencies that oversee stock and futures markets
would create a single Markets and Trading Commission.
   A bill to merge the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission was introduced Wednesday but
even supporters concede it faces rough going.
   Meanwhile, the chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees
the SEC proposed a bill to curb abuses in the low cost, high risk
``penny stock'' market.
   The CFTC, which regulates the futures exchanges, and the SEC,
which oversees the securities industry, have been squabbling over
which agency has authority to regulate so-called ``hybrid''
products, such as stock index futures.
   The proposed new agency would be phased in over a two-year
period and one division would still deal exclusively with physical
commodities such as metals, oil and farm products like wheat, pork
bellies and soybeans.
   Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., who co-sponsored the bill with Rep.
Dennis E. Eckart, D-Ohio, said the legislation does not seek ``to
create a super SEC or a super CFTC. It is not a takeover of one
agency by the other.''
   Glickman is a member of the House Agriculture Committee, which
oversees the CFTC, and Eckart sits on the Energy and Commerce
Committee that keeps tabs on the SEC. They said committees in both
ther Senate and House with jurisdiction over each agency would
retain their oversight authority _ despite the merger.
   Congressional oversight has been a stumbling block to previous
merger efforts and may remain so.
   ``It moves around the furniture and puts them all in one room
but I'm not sure if it gets you any benefits,'' said Rep. Glenn
English, D-Okla., chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees
the CFTC.
   ``I think its unnecessary. It's a kick in the face of the
commodities industry to suggest that they will lose their identity
and lose their uniqueness,'' said Rep. E. Thomas Coleman, R-Mo.,
the ranking minority member of the subcommittee.
   The CFTC-SEC rivalry heated up after a federal appeals court
ruled last year that CFTC has authority over a financial product
with any aspect of a futures contract _ including stock index
futures.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady has proposed stripping the
CFTC of some or all of its authority over financial futures.
   And SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden has said that at the very
least, the SEC should have authority over stock index futures.
   Glickman and Eckart said their bill ``is a wholesale
reorganization of how the government oversees these markets.''
   But a spokesman for the CFTC, David Gary, said ``we see no no
need to combine the agencies.''
   The penny stock reform bill proposed by Rep. Edward Markey,
D-Mass., would require that all penny stocks be traded through an
automated quotation system.
   Penny stocks, inexpensive but highly risky securities that
usually aren't listed on stock exchanges, are legal, but they are
usually issued by new companies with untested or uneven track
records.
   That makes them risky _ and often prone to fraud _ because
information about their earnings history is hard to come by or
confirm.
   State-level securities regulators have said penny stock fraud
costs U.S. investors $2 billion a year.
   The proposed legislation would ban ``blank check'' stock
offerings and ``blind pool'' penny stocks, which offer stock to the
public in companies that plan to engage in mergers and acquisitions
_ but without clearly stating their business goals.

<HEAD>Say Icahn Resurfaces as Possible Buyer of Eastern</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trans World Airlines owner Carl Icahn has
resurfaced as a possible buyer of Eastern Airlines, whose unsecured
creditors have stepped up pressure for a sale, sources said.
   Icahn and associates held informal discussions recently with
representatives of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., financial advisers to the
committee of Eastern's unsecured creditors, said the sources, who
spoke Wednesday on condition they not be identified.
   The talks have been preliminary and the notion of an Icahn bid
for Eastern has not yet ``ripened,'' one source said.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell declined to comment on the
matter. Icahn was said by his office to be unavailable for comment,
and aides at Goldman, Sachs didn't return phone calls.
   Goldman, Sachs is said to have told the committee recently that
TWA wasn't interested in bidding for Eastern, but a source close to
the company said there is some interest.
   The creditors' committee, exasperated by Eastern's mounting
losses, voted Tuesday to reject the airline's latest reorganization
proposal and seek the appointment of a special trustee to sell
Eastern. The creditors have been soliciting possible buyers behind
the scenes in recent weeks, sources say.
   Icahn, a corporate investor who took TWA private in October
1988, appears to have emerged as the leading potential buyer, the
sources said. They suggested he might bid for Eastern in concert
with other investors.
   Icahn's interest in Miami-based Eastern goes back at least to
September 1988, when members of Eastern's Machinists union met with
him about a possible bid.
   After Eastern's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing on March 9, 1989,
and the subsequent collapse of an attempted buyout led by
ex-baseball commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth, Icahn was the unions'
favorite to buy the airline.
   Machinists, pilots and flight attendants struck Eastern on March
4, 1989.
   Icahn was TWA's ``white knight'' in 1986, buying the airline in
a $440 million deal to thwart an attempted takeover by Frank
Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp.
   Industry analysts have noted a potential compatibility between
Eastern and TWA. Easter operates mainly between the Northeast and
Florida and Atlanta, while TWA is strongest in trans-Atlantic
operations.
   But Icahn backed off from Eastern last May. TWA said then it
needed more time to discuss with its unions the feasibility of
integrating the TWA and Eastern workforces and was not prepared to
submit a formal bid.
   Eastern, battered by the strike, continues to report losses and
is having difficulty attracting passengers.
   The airline has sold more than $800 million in assets with the
approval of a U.S. Bankruptcy Court, and would now be valued at far
less than the $464 million offered by the Ueberroth group.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland has approved Eastern's
agreement to sell its valuable Latin American routes to American
Airlines for $349 million. The transaction still must be approved
by the Transportation Department, which is expected to decide by
Friday.
   TWA has problems of its own, including a steep rise in operating
expenses. It recently reported a net loss of $298.5 million in
1989, compared with a profit of $249.7 million the previous year.
   Icahn has been pushing in recent months for wage concessions,
seeking $80 million in wage and benefit cuts from pilots, for
example.
   Some believe Icahn wants to leave the airline business
altogether. He is the largest stockholder of USX Corp., and
recently asked the shareholders for a non-binding vote on a
proposal to spin off the steel division. There has been speculation
that he could move to take over all of USX.

<HEAD>Pension Fund Trustees Disappointed After Exxon Meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trustees of New York City and California pension
funds who want Exxon Corp. to act now to prevent future
environmental accidents like the Alaskan oil spill didn't hear what
they wanted from the company's chairman.
   ``We did not get any concrete commitments'' other than a promise
of a future meeting, said Elizabeth Holtzman, the New York City
comptroller.
   But she called Wednesday's session with Chairman Lawrence G.
Rawl ``useful, the beginning of a dialogue.''
   Officials of the funds, which are some of Exxon's biggest
shareholders, requested the meeting because of concern about the
impact on the company's earnings _ and ultimately the price of
their stock holdings _ from accidents like last year's disastrous
Alaska oil spill.
   California Comptroller Gray Davis said he was disappointed Rawl
did not agree to follow any of several suggestions made by the
pension fund officials.
   ``We did not come away with any specific promises,'' said Davis.
``However, I know we got his attention.''
   The officials said they asked Exxon to take several steps,
including annual environmental audits. They asked the oil company
to examine its operations, identify high-risk procedures and show
what actions are being taken to reduce those risks.
   They also asked for creation of special response teams to deal
with environmental accidents and asked Rawl to send letters to
Exxon employees urging them to confidentially report any
environmental problems at company facilities.
   Davis also asked Rawl to go to Alaska to inspect the damage
caused by the Exxon Valdez spill in Prince William Sound, which
killed wildlife and fouled miles of coastline.
   The meeting also was attended by Paul Quirk, executive director
of Massachusetts' pension fund board.
   The pension funds of California, Massachusetts and New York City
hold a combined 14 million Exxon shares, or slightly more than 1
percent of the company's outstanding stock.
   Pension funds and other institutional investors with big
stockholdings have become more active shareholders in recent years
on environmental issues, corporate takeovers and other matters.
   ``Exxon has to get off the dime, has to make a clear commitment
to environmental safety. Otherwise our beneficiaries will get the
short end of the stick,'' Davis said.
   Exxon issued a statement after the meeting, saying Rawl had
noted that ``shareholder returns have been excellent in the recent
past despite 1989.''
   Holtzman and Davis said Rawl told them he would respond to their
suggestions before the company's April 25 annual meeting.
   But the pension fund executives said they were concerned about
the future.
   ``Exxon has many different kinds of operations, and unless they
identify other areas of environmental risk and correct them
beforehand, it could cause other disasters and could affect the
company and our shares,'' Holtzman said in a telephone interview.
   Davis, also interviewed by telephone, said, ``By setting aside
revenue every time there's an accident, Exxon can't compete with
the rest of the industry.''
   Exxon's stock has been largely flat in the year since the Alaska
spill. It traded in the $45 range at the time of the accident. The
stock was down 62{ cents to $46.50 a share in late New York Stock
Exchange trading Wednesday.
   The cleanup of the Exxon Valdez spill so far has cost the
company nearly $3 billion. Exxon set aside $1.3 billion last year,
but the company still faces more than 170 civil suits brought by
fishermen and others who claim they suffered losses because of the
Alaska spill.
   Exxon also has been indicted by the federal government on
charges related to the spill. That likely will increase the
company's legal bills and could result in fines against Exxon.
   Suits also are pending from the Jan. 1 heating oil spill in the
Arthur Kill waterway between New York City and New Jersey.

<HEAD>Stocks Regain After Early Plunge; Dollar Down</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index plunged more
than 1,000 points this morning on rumors some small brokerages
faced bankruptcy, then regained most of its losses as large
securities firms moved to support the market, traders said.
   The dollar ended sharply lower against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average closed at 28,249.06, down
193.88 points, or 0.68 percent. It dropped to 27,354.00 at the end
of morning session _ 1,088.94 points, or 3.83 percent, below
Wednesday's close.
   The Nikkei index fell 316.78 points on Wednesday.
   Katsumi Nishikido, a trader with Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru
Securities Co., attributed the index's afternoon rebound to active
buying by major securities firms to support the falling market.
   He said that in early trading, a lack of buy orders meant no
prices could be put on about 100 stocks that have been the target
of speculation or manipulation.
   Yasumasa Shinagawa, a trader with Yamaichi Securities Co.,
attributed this morning's plunge to reports of ``a collapse of
speculator groups'' that were said to be in financial trouble.
   Local news reports, confirmed by a broker who refused to be
named, said more than 30 minor brokerages had been left with
massive losses by speculators who were unable or unwilling to pay
for their buy orders. The broker said his firm had been informed of
the problem by stock exchange authorities.
   Some speculative issues inched up in the afternoon as other
issues were bought back, Nishikido said, ``but speculative issues
have not hit bottom yet.''
   He said about 200 such speculative issues are listed on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, and about 70 are among the 225 issues in the
Nikkei index.
   Speculative issues can be easily identified by wild price
movements unrelated to market trends, Nishikido added.
   ``Those speculative issues started plunging late in February,
and now they are doing terribly,'' he said.
   The price of Kagoshima Bank shares, identified as one such
issue, ended at 860 points today, down from almost 3,000 points in
early March.
   A broker, who requested anonymity, said Kagoshima Bank shares
had been manipulated by a Tokyo hotel owner.
   Generally, speculators remain behind the scenes in the market,
and some are generally thought to have close links to organized
crime.
   Tokyo Stock Exchange executive Kazuhiro Nagakawa told reporters
in a hastily called news conference after the morning session, ``I
would like to ask investors not to panic because of a series of
speculations flying around the market.''
   An offiicial in the stock exchange's investigative arm said it
had been watching the price fluctuations of such issues.
   ``We have cautioned our member securities houses about this
problem, among other things,'' he said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   But he said ``the issue is basically a problem between
securities firms and their customers. We are trying not to make a
big fuss about it. ... If we did, it might make the market
performance even worse.''
   While major securities firms generally avoid speculators, small
securities firms are more likely to become involved with risky
investors in order to increase their business.
   Takaaki Okada, spokesman for the Securities Dealers' Association
of Japan, said he had heard of the reports but that the association
had not confirmed any bankruptcies among securities houses.
   ``We think the situation has not been serious enough to warrant
any official measures or public announcement,'' he said.
   Okada ruled out the possibility of bankruptcies of accredited
Japanese financial institutions because ``the Finance Ministry will
offer take some actions by the time a company gets into trouble.''
   An official at the ministry also denied reports about
bankruptcies, and said it will take preventative measures to
protect securities firms and banks.
   Masahiro Umemori, an analyst with Nomura Securities, said the
market, already in a pessimistic mood, overreacted to the news
reports.
   Meanwhile, on the foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at
157.90 yen, down 1.00 yen from Wednesday's close of 158.90 yen. It
opened at 158.32 yen and ranged between 157.45 yen and 158.35 yen.
   Dealers attributed the yen's recovery to growing sentiment that
a correction is under way after the dollar's surge to the 160-yen
level, and to position adjustments before the weekend meeting of
finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrialized nations in
Paris.
   Benchmark No. 119 Japanese government bonds ended trading at
86.55 points, up from Wednesday's close of 86.45. Their yield was
7.240 percent, down from the previous day's 7.260 percent.
   Analysts said stability in the bond market was a positive sign.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge has approved the sale of the
beleaguered MiniScribe Corp. to a California computer disk drive
manufacturer for $46 million despite a higher offer from another
firm.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Charles Matheson late Wednesday issued a
court order approving the sale to Maxtor Corp. of San Jose, Calif.,
following his receipt of Maxtor's outline of the financial and
management details for MiniScribe.
   Richard Rifenburgh, president of the Longmont, Colo.-based
MiniScribe, said Maxtor's operations provided the best complement
to MiniScribe of all the companies that expressed interest.
   ``It's the best possible situation for MiniScribe employees,''
he said.
   Maxtor's bid to buy the firm included a commitment to retain
MiniScribe's operations in Longmont, which was one reason its
proposal was favored over an estimated $51 million bid from Wearnes
Technology Ltd., which is based in Singapore.
   MiniScribe filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code Jan. 1 after failing to settle numerous lawsuits
that alleged the company's past management committed fraud. Its
debts total about $110 million.
   Last month, company officials told Matheson they were running
out of money to keep plants operating and asked for the stepped-up
court-ordered auction.
   Attorneys worked through the night on negotiations with Maxtor,
Wearnes and Standard Chartered Bank of Hong Kong, MiniScribe's lead
lender.
   Before a courtroom packed with more than two dozen MiniScribe
employees and numerous lawyers, attorney Patrick A. Murphy detailed
Maxtor's original $40 million bid, consisting of $20 million in
cash and $20 million in common stock.
   The proposal covers substantially all of the assets of
MiniScribe, including its subsidiaries in Hong Kong and Singapore.
Maxtor also planned to send managers to Longmont's MiniScribe's
office and put up $30 million in working capital between now and
the proposed closing date July 1.
   But Murphy asked for a recess after hearing the terms of
Wearnes' bid, which included $46.5 million in cash, plus about $4.5
million in accounts receivable and cash in the two Far East
subsidiaries. Wearnes' proposed a closing date in May.
   Maxtor returned with a $41.5 million offer, plus the accounts
receivables and cash in the Far East subsidiaries.
   Gerald Munitz, attorney for Standard Chartered Bank, said the
creditor supported Maxtor's bid because there was a greater
certainty for employment in the Longmont area.
   George Scalise, Maxtor's president and chief executive officer,
said the proposal was based on the premise that MiniScribe would
remain open for business.
   No decision has been made yet on whether there would be layoffs
at the firm, or whether Maxtor would change MiniScribe's name, he
said. In the interim, MiniScribe would be operated as a subsidiary.
   ``For the most part, it will remain a stand-alone operation,''
he said. ``This is such a tough task to take on. If the doors had
been closed, we would have had to reassess it.''
   Attorney Glen Keller said MiniScribe received at least 111
inquiries from companies interested in purchasing the disk drive
manufacturer.
   Commenting on the unusual court-ordered auction process,
Matheson said he approved the step because it was clear that
MiniScribe would not have been able to continue operations without
an infusion of cash.
   Richard Yen, president of Wearnes' operations in the United
States, said he was disappointed with the outcome, but wouldn't
challenge the court's decision.

   Labor lawyer T. Timothy Ryan Jr. is preparing
to tackle what many consider the toughest financial job in the
country: regulator of the nation's 2,500 savings and loans.
   With Senate confirmation by an unexpectedly lopsided 62-37 vote
Wednesday, Ryan takes over as director of the Treasury Department's
Office of Thrift Supervision. Seventeen Democrats joined all 45
Republican senators in voting for him.
   His five-year term likely will be the critical period in
determining whether thrift associations survive as a separate
industry. They lost a record $19 billion last year.
   After he is sworn in, probably on Monday, Ryan will be
responsible for administering toughened financial standards enacted
last August as part of President Bush's savings and loan bailout.
He will decide which institutions stay in business and which are
seized by the government.
   Democrats opposed to his nomination said the 44-year-old
attorney, who has specialized in pension and employee benefit law,
is ill-prepared for the task because he lacks banking experience.
   Ryan was chief attorney for the Labor Department early in the
Reagan administration and worked in the presidential campaigns of
Bush and Gerald R. Ford.
   ``He's an outstanding lawyer as far as I know and an outstanding
person,'' said Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D.. ``That's not the question.
This man has no experience in the financial services industry and
this job is the biggest financial services job in the world.''
   Ryan's admission that he tried marijuana and cocaine 17 years
ago as a law student figured little in the debate. Only Ryan
supporters raised the subject during the six-hour debate.
   White House lobbyist Tom Korologos said the vote marked a
turning point in the political treatment of youthful drug
experimentation by government appointees.
   ``It's going to be difficult to make it an issue from now on,''
he said.
   After the vote, several legislators took to the Senate floor to
condemn the leak of Ryan's confidential FBI report. Sen. John C.
Danforth, R-Mo., called on the Senate Ethics Committee to
investigate.
   The administration lobbied hard for Ryan, with Treasury
Secretary Nicholas F. Brady making daily calls. The administration
portrayed him as an experienced manager who had authority over 600
lawyers at the Labor Department and helped clean up irregularities
in the Teamsters union's Central States Pension Fund.
   ``I don't think you have to be a thrift insider ... to take the
job of overseeing the savings and loan industry,'' said Senate
Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas. ``Let's face it. It's the
insiders ... who got us where we are today, drowning in a cesspool
of unbridled greed and fiscal irresponsibility.''
   The victory margin was wider than both Democrats and Republicans
predicted.
   ``The White House has an awful lot of clout and they certainly
used it,'' said Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, who opposed
Ryan. ``The secretary of the treasury was working the halls of
Congress and working them well.''
   Ryan, in a statement released after the vote, thanked Brady and
said, ``I look forward to working closely with the Congress in
addressing the problems of the thrift industry.''
   The appointment removes a constitutional challenge to the
administration's S&amp;L bailout. A federal judge ruled two weeks ago
that the agency's officials lacked authority to seize failed
institutions. The decision was delayed by an appeals court, but
only until April 11.
   In case Ryan was defeated, Riegle had prepared legislation that
would remove the basis of the legal challenge and allow President
Bush to appoint an acting director without challenge.

   There is an $18 light bulb that lasts seven
years and uses only one-fourth of the energy. And a solar powered
car. And don't forget Mr. R.E. Cycle, a dummy made of recycled
plastic bottles and bags.
   In two large tents stretching more than a block in the Capitol's
shadow, corporate America is showing off its best environmental
face in a five-day technology fair.
   Some environmentalists were hardly impressed as the fair opened
Wednesday on the national Mall. Several members of Greenpeace
handcuffed themselves to a support pole near the Du Pont Chemical
Co. exhibit. They were among 19 Greenpeace members who were
arrested for demonstrating without a permit, according to the U.S.
Park Police.
   ``Corporate America has begun a campaign to paint themselves
green,'' said Peter Bahouth, executive director of Greenpeace USA.
A Greenpeace banner proclaimed: ``Don't Be Fooled _ Industry
Greenwash.''
   Bahouth complained that while some of the exhibits by more than
100 companies and trade associations might be environmentally
beneficial, many of the same companies are guilty of pollution and
environmental neglect in other aspects of their businesses.
   But organizers of the fair _ dubbed Earth Tech _ maintained that
many of the exhibits demonstrate business' interest in making
environmental improvements.
   ``I don't think that you can make anything these days without
using energy or polluting the environment. The question is how
much,'' said Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., co-chairman of the fair's
organizing committee.
   The Earth Tech program was said by organizers to have cost about
$1 million, mostly paid by exhibitors.
   The participants included Fortune 500 companies such as Du Pont
and AT&amp;T but also some lesser knowns such as Oil Stop Inc., which
says it has invented a new type of boom to capture oil spills _ the
``self-energizing oil containment system.''
   It's so compact, said company official Richard Lazes, that a
5,000-foot spool could be put on a tanker and unwound within
minutes. That much boom would have surrounded the Exxon Valdez, he
said.
   While several oil companies ``are excited about it, they've made
no commitment yet,'' he added.
   Producers of solar, thermal and wind-generated energy were
prominent, as were companies in the rapidly growing industry of
waste management and disposal _ and, of course, recycling.
   Some exhibits approached the exotic: a solar-powered car that
had traveled across the country; a model of a ``wind plant'' to
show that wind power already is generating millions of kilowatts of
power in parts of California; and the $18 electric bulb that lasts
seven years, won't break and uses one-fourth of the energy than a
conventional bulb.
   ``That's equivalent to not burning 400 pounds of coal over the
life of the bulb,'' said Steve Waxman of Philips Lighting Co. The
``Earth Light'' isn't available in hardware stores yet but may soon
be, he said.
   At the Du Pont exhibit, displays touted the company's efforts to
push for plastic recycling.
   That's where visitors could find Mr. R.E. Cycle _ his limbs made
of beverage and detergent bottles, a torso of a recycled plastic
bag and his head a milk bottle, also of recycled plastic. He sat on
a wood-like bench made of plastic waste.
   At another booth, the American Wood Preservatives Institute and
the National Timber Piling Council passed out saplings wrapped in
paper and ready for planting. The industry over the years has been
criticized by environmentalists for polluting in its production of
chemically treated lumber products.
   But they too had a good environmental story to tell, noting the
longevity of treated lumber. ``Treated Wood Saves Trees,'' read the
white and green buttons next to the rows of saplings.

<TEXT>
   Two top executives of the collapsed Flushing
Federal Savings and Loan Association were convicted of conspiring
with four others to drain the thrift of nearly $8 million.
   Flushing Federal's collapse in 1985 from bad loans represented
one of the largest S&amp;L failures in the Northeast, with losses of
$100 million, and was a precursor of the widespread insolvency in
the nation's thrift industry.
   A federal jury in Brooklyn on Wednesday convicted Carl
Cardascia, Flushing Federal's president, and Ronald J. Martorelli,
an assistant vice president and chief loan officer, of misapplying
funds in knowingly granting bad loans.
   The jury deliberated 3{ days following the nearly
three-month-long trial.
   Prosecutors had charged in a 64-count indictment that in
exchange for kickbacks, stock and other favors the bankers approved
millions of dollars in loans in 1984 to an admitted con man,
Michael Rapp, and three of his associates, including Jilly Rizzo, a
longtime friend of Frank Sinatra.
   Rizzo was one of four borrowers convicted in the scam.
   The defendants face up to five years on each of the numerous
charges when they're sentenced June 20 by U.S. District Judge Jack
B. Weinstein.
   ``The fraud was born when Michael Rapp and Carl Cardascia struck
a deal. Six months and 21 lines of credit later, Flushing Federal
was out $7,730,000,'' said the prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney
Steven M. Gold.
   Gold described Cardascia, 51, as a man willing to violate
virtually any banking regulation, ``if you can fill up his jacket
pocket fast enough.''
   Cardascia's lawyer, Joseph Ryan, told the jury that his client
was a victim, not a co-conspirator.
   ``He's a bad, bad banker,'' Ryan said of Cardascia, who started
out as a teller at Flushing Federal. ``Mr. Cardascia is guilty of
his own ineptitude.''
   Cardascia was convicted of scheming with Rapp, a career criminal
and master con artist who boasted of his illegal stock-market
exploits in the 1970s in his book ``The Wall Street Swindler.''
   Rapp, who testified for the prosecution, pleaded guilty to
defrauding Flushing Federal and a Florida bank and is serving a
15-year prison term.

<HEAD>Judge Grants Preliminary Injunction Against Railway Workers Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EASTON, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ordered a union to cancel
strike plans against Conrail, saying a walkout would greatly hurt
the public and other railroads.
   In granting a preliminary injunction Wednesday to Conrail, U.S.
District Judge Franklin S. Van Antwerpen said a strike by the
Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees would ``harm the public
good.''
   ``Because of the inter-connected nature of the railroad
business, any stoppage on Conrail inevitably affects other
carriers, including Amtrak and the commuter rail operators,'' Van
Antwerpen wrote.
   Conrail provides freight service, but its rails are used by the
other railroad companies in the District of Columbia, Canada and 15
northeastern states.
   In some states, the judge wrote, Conrail is the largest freight
carrier. If the strike were to occur Friday as planned, he wrote,
``the effect on the public good would be so great, and so obvious,
that it needs no further elaboration.''
   He added that ``Conrail will suffer substantial and irreparable
injury'' if the strike occurred.
   The union represents about 500 employees in eastern
Pennsylvania, northern New Jersey and New York state. It has been
negotiating with Philadelphia-based Conrail since 1988.
   ``We're disappointed with the decision,'' said Jed Todd, the
union's general chairman for Pennsylvania. ``This has been going on
since June 1, 1988. That's why we're a little aggravated.''
   He added that the union was still evaluating the judge's ruling
to determine the next step.
   Conrail spokeswoman Pat Linskey said the railroad company had no
comment on the decision.
   The dispute centers on wages, hours, benefits, safety and job
security. The union, represented by attorney John Clarke Jr.,
argued that Conrail has been bargaining in bad faith.
   But the judge wrote Wednesday that both sides appeared to be
negotiating properly under the existing collective bargaining
agreement.

   Eastern Airlines said it asked a bankruptcy judge
to impose a new long-term contract on its pilots union because of
an impasse in negotiations and cost reductions needed to emerge
from bankruptcy.
   The filing Wednesday will at least provide a chance to air the
union's dispute with Miami-based Eastern in court, said E.J. Breen,
spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association.
   ``At least, it isn't a slam, dunk,'' Breen said of the airline's
contract request. ``We go in and argue our case.''
   But the pilots union feared its members could end up with no
contract at all, he said. The pilots have charged that Frank
Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp., is out to
break the union.
   In announcing the filing, Eastern said it was frustrated that
negotiations with the pilots' union since the last permanent
contract expired in July 1988 had not led to a new agreement
despite federal mediation.
   ``We are reluctantly forced to resort to the established
bankruptcy process to resolve an otherwise intractable problem,''
said Thomas J. Matthews, senior vice president of human resources
and the company's chief labor negotiator.
   The request came after the pilots union last weekend approved a
four-month interim contract that included 25 percent pay cuts for
working union pilots.
   The interim contract, retroactive to March 1, does not affect
the salaries of pilots hired after Eastern's machinists, pilots and
flight attendants began their strike on March 4, 1989. The jobs of
the newly hired pilots are under court challenge from the pilots
union.
   The striking pilots and flight attendants ended their walkout in
sympathy with the machinists in November. Eastern currently has
some 1,800 pilots.
   Matthews said the interim pact ``falls woefully short'' and
claimed the carrier's proposed contract is needed to pull Eastern
out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
   ``It's a total package that would offer savings in excess of $50
million a year,'' said Eastern spokesman Robin Matell. ``It covers
wages, benefits, working conditions and an emphasis on increased
productivity.
   ``The negotiations have been dragging out, not going on,''
Matell said. ``This way, by going through the bankrupcty court, it
will be resolved in one way or another.''
   A sticking point in negotiations is the union's efforts to have
union pilots hired back by Eastern. But the airlines has said it
has no openings.
   Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the court has up to 21 days to
schedule a hearing and another 30 days to rule on Eastern's
application.
   Eastern's proposed long-term contract calls for 20 percent pay
reductions for all pilots for the first six months of the
agreement, Matell said. The company would restore half the cuts in
the following six months, he said.
   The pact also includes some temporary pension plan concessions
and boosts pilots' monthly flight hours from 52{ to about 60.

   Stock prices advanced slightly today after a
rumored financial storm in Tokyo failed to materialize.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up 2.25 to
2,721.62 in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 558 up, 363 down and
518 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 21.32 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Prices of U.S. stocks pulled back on Tuesday amid talk that the
battered Japanese market might be hit with a fresh wave of selling
overnight.
   As it turned out, Tokyo stock prices did decline sharply in
early trading, but then recovered most of their losses.
   Analysts said that calmed whatever fears had been stirring that
pressure on stocks in Japan might soon start to exert an increasing
influence in other markets around the world.
   At the same time, brokers said, traders in this country were
proceeding carefully in advance of Friday's monthly report on the
employment situation.
   Among Japanese issues traded on U.S. exchanges, Matsushita
Electrical climbed 8&rsqb; to 145; Kyocera 3} to 100, and Honda Motor 1&rsqb;
to 23\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .26 to 187.57. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was off .07 at 361.05.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 17.34 to
2,719.37.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 8 to 5 on the
NYSE, with 586 up, 915 down and 472 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 159.54 million shares, against 154.31

<TEXT>
   Japan must redouble its efforts to meet the
objectives of a 1986 agreement on increasing the foreign share of
Japan's semiconductor market, U.S. trade officials said Thursday.
   ``We're disappointed. We think the progress thus far has been
unsatisfactory,'' a U.S. trade official told reporters. Under rules
of the briefing none of the officials may be identified.
   ``The heat is on,'' said another U.S. official. ``We're looking
for results across the board under the original agreement.''
   With 16 months left before the 1986 bilateral semiconductor
agreement expires, U.S. officials say they want Japan to increase
efforts to help foreign chip producers boost their current 12.9
percent share of the market to 20 percent by 1991. The United
States contends this was agreed to in the pact.
   Japanese officials have said the 20 percent figure was merely a
goal.
   Foreign chips, which are mostly American, held 8.6 percent of
the Japanese market at the time of the agreement.
   The two countries completed a regular review of the pact
Wednesday.
   The officials said most major Japanese semiconductor users have
adopted plans to increase their foreign share of chips, a step they
found encouraging. But foreign manufacturers supply only 3 percent
of the chips used in Japanese consumer electronics products and 3
percent to 5 percent of those used in Japanese cars.
   By contrast, U.S. producers supply 70 percent of the chips used
in European autos, the officials said.
   They added that Japan's Ministry of International Trade and
Industry is ``candidly and sincerely'' working to put the agreement
into practice.
   Under the agreement, Japan also pledged to stop unfair pricing
of computer chips overseas, called dumping. U.S. officials say
Japan has kept that promise.
   During a regular review of the agreement, which is held two or
three times a year, Japan told the United States its efforts to buy
more foreign semiconductors will suffer if Washington charges that
chips face trade barriers in Japan under the ``Super 301'' clause
of the U.S. Omnibus Trade Act.
   The clause requires U.S. trade officials to prepare an annual
``hit list'' of trade barriers faced by U.S. products, together
with a deadline for a negotiated resolution aimed at getting the
barriers eliminated. That priority list is due April 30. If
negotiations fail, the United States can impose penalties.
   The U.S. government is considering placing semiconductors on the
list, in response to requests from American chip makers, the U.S.
officials confirmed.
   U.S. semiconductor industry groups say their limited sales
success in Japan shows that restrictions exist against foreign
chips, while Japanese companies have called for U.S. suppliers to
make greater sales and quality-control efforts.
   A Japanese official said Japanese companies were making serious
efforts to buy more U.S. semiconductors, particularly for
automobiles and electronic products.

   House negotiators worked on details of new
clean air legislation today as the latest government air quality
survey showed 121 million Americans living in pollution exceeding
federal health standards.
   The Environmental Protection Agency also said in its annual
assessment of air quality that the urban smog problem became 15
percent worse in 1988 compared to the year before, partly because
of an exceedingly hot summer. That year is the latest for which
data is available.
   The survey showed 121 million people lived in areas in which air
pollution exceeded the health standards for various pollutants,
including smog.
   The agency statistics, some of which had been reported
previously as preliminary data, showed emissions of sulfur dioxide
and nitrogen dioxide both increased slightly while levels of carbon
dioxide and dust or dirt declined somewhat.
   The emissions are largely the product of automobile travel,
industrial releases or the burning of fossil fuels by electric
power plants.
   The report shows that over the past decade pollution levels have
declined considerably, but it also ``shows the magnitude of the air
pollution problem still remaining,'' said EPA Administrator William
K. Reilly.
   The EPA released the annual report two days after the Senate
approved a comprehensive air pollution control bill and as members
of the House Energy and Commerce Committee continued closed-door
negotiations on clean air legislation. The House talks lasted late
into the evening Wednesday.
   Some participants in the bargaining, speaking privately, said
the matter was close to being resolved, possibly today.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the committee, has said
he wants a final committee vote on the complex, expensive and
controversial clean air bill by the end of the week when Congress
goes on Easter recess.
   After the Senate approved a sweeping air pollution control bill
on Tuesday, the focus shifted to the House where the bill
languished in Dingell's committee for months.
   Committee members have worked out compromise agreements on
several provisions dealing with controls on urban smog. But the
thorny issue of acid rain controls was kept for last.
   Many Midwest congressmen contend that a ``cost sharing''
arrangement must be worked out to help utilities in the region cut
sulfur dioxide emissions from some of the country's dirtiest
coal-fired electric plant.
   According to committee sources, Rep. Philip Sharp, D-Ind., who
has led the cost-sharing fight, floated a revised proposal
Wednesday calling for a complex allocation of ``pollution
allowances'' to help the Midwest and utilities in other areas where
there is fear that new pollution controls might inhibit future
expansion.
   Both the House and Senate bill call for broad-ranging emission
controls on automobiles, factories and electric power plants in an
attempt to reduce pollution from acid rain, urban smog and toxic
industrial chemicals. Utilities would have to cut annual sulfur
dioxide emissions nearly in half, or by about 10 million tons, by
the year 2000.
   Neither industry nor environmentalists have been happy about the
Senate legislation, approved 89-11 on Tuesday, and each side has
hoped to push for changes in the House bill.
   The environmentalists have called for stronger smog controls
than provided by the Senate bill, while industry has complained
that requirements dealing with toxic chemical releases and acid
rain are too tough.

   Progress is being made in talks aimed at
crafting an unprecedented deal to reform the basic economies of
Japan and the United States, according to negotiators who hope to
wrap up the four days of discussion today.
   A leading congressional trade expert, Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont.,
told reporters that he understood the delay was caused by the
complexity and number of details being reviewed and questions over
the wording of the proposal.
   Baucus said he understood the discussions were close to ending
with release of an interim report reviewing the progress so far.
   Both sides insisted that progress was still being made even
though the discussions seeking to correct broad based structural
barriers to trade have lasted two more days than originally planned.
   Baucus praised the Japanese for being willing to make
concessions, but he said the real test of the agreement would be in
its ability to actually reduce America's huge trade deficit with
Japan.
   President Bush had words of praise for the Japanese as well,
marking a turnabout for the administration, which until recently
had been blasting Japan for its intransigence on the trade issue.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said the length of the
discussions did not indicate any unexpected roadblocks, but she did
sound a warning Wednesday about what could happen if the
discussions did not succeed.
   ``If the Japanese do not open their second largest market in the
world, there will be enormous political pressure to restrict those
(trade) opportunities that have given them so much,'' she told an
audience of American manufacturers. ``It will kill the goose that
laid their golden egg.''
   The talks are unprecedented in their scope because they aim not
at boosting sales of specific products but at correcting broad
barriers to trade in both countries.
   The effort has prompted Japanese critics to charge that the
United States was trying to remake their nation and scrap centuries
of tradition.
   However, the Bush administration, which began the discussions
last July, has maintained that its proposals would benefit Japanese
consumers by increasing competition and thus lowering retail
prices, currently among the highest in the industrial world.
   Bush met Wednesday with Nubuo Matsunaga, a special emissary from
Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, and afterward the White
House issued a statement praising Kaifu's role in bringing about a
new spirit of cooperation.
   In the past 10 days, U.S. and Japanese negotiators have settled
disputes involving sales of American-made telecommunications
equipment, satellites and supercomputers.
   Baucus, chairman of the Senate trade subcommittee, told
reporters Wednesday he was impressed by Japan's efforts.
   ``I am willing to bury the hatchet with Japan if Japan is
willing to open its markets,'' he said. ``Congress is quite hopeful
about the new attention given in Japan to resolving trade issues.''
   The administration is facing a congressionally imposed deadline
of April 30 to decide which countries to target under a second
round of negotiations aimed at removing trade barriers.
   The trade committee of the National Association of Manufacturers
urged the administration Wednesday to put Japan on the trade ``hit
list'' again, regardless of the outcome of the current talks, to
keep pressure on Kaifu's government.
   ``The Japanese have out-negotiated us in the past by making
promises where there is no follow-up,'' said NAM President Jerry
Jasinowski.
   Negotiators involved in this week's discussions were preparing
an interim progress report outlining reforms each side is willing
to make, with a final report scheduled for early July.
   Among the changes expected to be offered on the Japanese side
were proposals to increase enforcement of antitrust laws, boost
spending for public works projects and relax restrictions on the
establishment of large retail stores in Japan.
   On the U.S. side, the administration was not likely to agree to
Japan's suggestions to boost U.S. competitiveness by restricting
Americans' use of credit cards, hiking the gasoline tax and
eliminating tax deductions for home mortgage payments.
   However, the administration was expected to point to efforts to
provide expanded tax credits for personal savings, improve the U.S.
education system and balance the federal budget.

   The Senate Agriculture Committee voted today
to substantially change the government's foreign food aid programs
to better help the world's hungriest people and encourage emerging
democracies.
   The legislation, approved on voice vote, would provide food
grants to the poorest countries, reorganize the food aid
bureaucracy and allow the president more leeway in giving food to
nations whose governments he wants to bolster.
   The bill will be the agricultural trade portion, or title, of
the 1990 farm bill that will go the Senate floor. The House
Agriculture Committee has not acted on foreign trade.
   ``This title makes the most dramatic change in American foreign
food policy in a quarter of a century,'' said committee Chairman
Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who coauthored the measure with Sen. Richard
Lugar of Indiana, the panel's ranking Republican.
   Ann Veneman, deputy undersecretary for international affairs and
commodity programs, said the committee's staff worked with the Bush
administration to write the bill.
   ``There are areas where we did not agree, but nothing so major
it can't be worked out,'' she said after the committe voted.
   The programs provided for in the bill would cost an estimated
$1.5 billion annually, which would be paid directly from the budget
and by money received from repayment of debts on previous food
loans. The amount is comparable to previous years.
   Leahy said the bill would make the government's international
food aid system ``more reflective of the realities of today.''
   ``It also gives the United States powerful new weapons in
providing critical food aid to emerging democracies in Eastern
Europe, Central America and worldwide,'' he said.
   The legislation would establish a ``food for freedom'' program
under which the president could donate food to countries trying to
set up democracies, and spend up to $100 million for agricultural
necessities such as fertilizers and transportation.
   Poor countries least able to produce their own food would be
eligible for food grants and forgiveness of debts incurred through
previous food loans.
   Currently, food is sold to poor countries at reduced interest
rates over a 40-year term, but that only makes a bad debt situation
worse for those countries, Leahy and Lugar said.
   About $12 billion is owed to the United States through
agricultural programs, Lugar said. ``We think we have an interest
in part of that debt and would like in the case of the most
desperate countries to offer some relief,'' he said.
   Leahy said the debt forgiveness proposal is aimed at the
drought-stricken countries of sub-Saharan Africa.
   Sen. Chrstopher Bond, R-Mo., said some parts of Latin America
also should be included in the grant and debt forgiveness plan, but
Leahy responded: ``There's only so much debt forgiveness we can do.
Countries you are talking about have the ability to raise food.''
   The legislation makes food grants part of an ongoing policy for
the first time. Previously, food has been given away on an ad hoc
basis or in emergencies, said an aide to the Senate committee.
   Leahy said the bill also would clean up mismanagement and
bureaucratic red tape that frustrates the aid programs.
   Five agencies _ the Agriculture, State and Treasury departments,
the Office of Management and Budget and the Agency for
International Development _ all now have a say in how food aid is
distributed.
   The bill would put AID in charge of the grant program and make
USDA responsible for the sales program aimed at developing new
markets.
   The Agriculture Committee accepted an amendment by Sen. Bob
Kerrey, D-Neb., requiring the Agriculture Department to spend at
least $900 million in fiscal 1991 on the Export Enhancement Program
and removing the ceiling that has existed on the program.
   Kerrey said the administration needed the provision to use in
international trade talks against countries that heavily subsidize
their own exports to the detriment of the free market.
   Under the program, exporters are given bonuses that bring down
the cost of U.S. products to foreign countries. USDA decides which
countries qualify for those sales.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade with wheat giving
up some of the strong gains posted in the three previous sessions.
   Wheat futures surged Wednesday amid fears of a weekend freeze in
the U.S. winter wheat region and concerns about tight deliverable
supplies.
   The freeze fears have lessened somewhat but tight-supply
concerns persist following a Wall Street Journal report that
Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs owns about half the wheat
available for delivery against the May futures contract.
   Jacobs told the Journal he no longer holds any futures contracts
on wheat and is not trying to squeeze the wheat market.
   Jerry Zusel, manager of Balfour Maclaine Corp.'s floor
operations at the Board of Trade, said wheat traders are more
worried about the possibility of frost damage to the newly sprouted
winter wheat crop in the central and southern Plains.
   Stronger export demand supported the corn market while higher
soybean meal prices helped to boost the beans.
   In early trading, wheat futures were } cent to 1} cents lower
with May at $3.69 a bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to \ cent higher
with May at $2.68\ a bushel; oats were { cent lower across the
board with May at $1.51} a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 1{
cents higher with May at $5.92{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly higher while pork futures were mostly
lower in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .12 cent higher with April at
78.67 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .23 cent
higher with April at 82.50 cents a pound; live hogs were .25 cent
lower to .08 cent higher with April at 54.82 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .05 cent to .17 cent lower with May at 54.90
cents a pound.
   Cattle futures moved lower on Wednesday while pork futures were

   Eastman Kodak Co. was fined $1 million
today after pleading guilty to two misdemeanor violations of state
environmental laws.
   Kodak was charged with illegally disposing of contaminated soil
in 1986 and of failing to report a leak of a toxic solvent for five
days in 1987.
   City Judge Herman J. Walz accepted the plea agreement, but said
he questioned the wisdom of granting Kodak officials and directors
immunity from prosecution.
   The agreement lets ``people who have participated in criminal
acts go unpunished,'' Walz said. ``It is the opinion of the court
that (corporate) officers and employees should also be prosecuted.''
   Kodak was fined $997,500 for its illegal handling of the
contaminated soil. Assistant Attorney General Paul McCarthy said
Kodak hired an unauthorized company to haul away nearly 50,000
pounds of soil contaminated with silver.
   The incident was one of a series of violations by Kodak,
McCarthy said.
   Kodak was fined the maximum penalty of $2,500 for failing to
report a spill of 5,100 gallons of methylene chloride until five
days after it had been discovered.The chemical is considered a
probable human carcinogen by the Environmental Protection Agency.
   State officials were expected to announce later today an
agreement that will require Kodak to pay another $1 million to
settle civil charges brought by the state Department of
Environmental Conservation.
   The Rochester Democrat and Chronicle reported that state
officials also will announce a legally binding consent order
requiring independent experts to conduct an environmental audit of
Kodak's chemical operations.
   Sources familiar with the terms of the order said Kodak will pay
for the study, the newspaper reported. The sources said the state
environmental agency will insist the audit be performed by a
consultant group with no close ties to Kodak or the state.
   The attorney general's office has been investigating Kodak's
contamination of ground water at its Kodak Park manufacturing
facility for nearly two years.
   A special grand jury has been looking into Kodak's possible
environmental violations since January. It has subpoenaed more than
80,000 documents from the company.

<HEAD>Fewer Companies Plan To Increase Capital Spending, Study Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fewer U.S. companies plan to increase their
capital spending budgets this year compared with 1989, according to
a national survey released Thursday.
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp. said 41 percent of the 5,000 companies it
polled plan to spend more on capital projects in 1990, down from 46
percent that planned bigger budgets last year.
   Despite the decline, Dun &amp; Bradstreet economist and chief
statistician Joseph Duncan said capital spending remains at
relatively high levels.
   ``While U.S. firms are less ambitious, they continue to increase
investments to replace plant and equipment,'' he said.
   The survey, which was conducted in December and January, showed
that 25 percent of the companies planned to cut capital spending
this year while 35 percent said they would maintain spending at
1989 levels.
   Among industries, the service sector and the construction
industry were particularly bullish about increasing spending.
Forty-five percent of the companies in both categories said they
planned to spend more money this year than last.
   Larger companies are more likely to increase their capital
spending annually. According to the survey, 50 percent of the
companies with over 10,000 employees will spend more, while 37
percent of those with fewer than 500 employees were planning
increases.
   ``Smaller businesses are more sensitive to fluctuations in the
business cycle, particularly with respect to higher interest
rates,'' Duncan said.
   The survey was based on a sample of 5,000 companies drawn from
Dun &amp; Bradstreet's database, which includes information on more
than 9 million U.S. companies and was statistically representative
of companies of all sizes in all industries.

<HEAD>Two Former Wall Streeters Form Alternative Employment Firm</HEAD>

   As a single mother balancing a high-pressure job
on Wall Street, Suzanne Rinfret Moore remembers working 12-hour
days and organizing her son's birthday party from a hotel phone
while out of town on business.
   The pressure selling government bonds to institutions was so
intense that Moore ``felt like I had to write a detailed memo about
why I needed to leave for three hours'' to attend a school play.
   After years of juggling, Moore quit her job at J.P. Morgan
Securities Co., where she rose to vice president, to form her own
business. She now works fewer and more flexible hours trying to
help other Wall Streeters strike a similar balance between their
roles as professionals and parents.
   Moore teamed with college chum Karen Strauss Cook, both 37, to
form Alterna-track Inc., a specialized search firm that matches top
professionals in the financial services industry with part-time or
temporary work.
   Working out of a midtown Manhattan office, it's a kind of
sophisticated Kelly Girl service for Harvard MBAs, takeover lawyers
and corporate accountants. Nearly 90 percent of Alterna-track's
candidates are women.
   Moore and Cook, a mother of two who, for a six-year stretch was
the only woman equity block trader at Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., had
plenty of contacts to tap.
   To confirm their hunch that women are hungry to cut back on
grueling hours but are afraid to admit it to hard-driving
employers, Moore and Cook sent hundreds of questionnaires to
high-level women in financial services companies.
   The response was even more resounding than they anticipated.
Within a few months they amassed a pool of more than 300 resumes,
mostly from women interested in everything from flexible time to
job-sharing to contract work.
   Their research paralleled a wealth of data already available.
   For example, a poll of 1,000 men and women conducted last year
by the executive search firm Robert Half International Inc. showed
78 percent would sacrifice rapid career advancement if it meant
spending more time with their families.
   The demand for the type of talent Alterna-track offers also
partly reflects the increased role women are playing in the
American labor pool. Many employers are finding that to hire and
retain the most talented, they must offer flexibility.
   Labor Department statistics show 57.6 percent of women age 20
and older are in the workforce. By the year 2000, 47.5 percent of
the workforce will be female, vs. 42.5 percent in 1980 and 38.1
percent in 1970, says the Hudson Institute, a research group that
has studied American labor trends.
   Moore and Cook launched a crusade to get employers to, in Cook's
words, ``retain the person during a critical few years'' when
childrearing is at its most intensive.
   ``If an intelligent employer could hold their hand, they'll be
back on track again,'' Cook said. The retention of valued employees
is worth more than a little inconvenience.
   For example, Moore and Cook said it costs about 150 percent of
an employee's annual salary to replace that employee.
   Besides the cost, employees have been ``groomed ... they know
the company vertically,'' Moore said, and companies should realize
that knowledge could take years to replace.
   In addition to assembling a rich resume pool, Moore and Cook are
targeting corporations, banks and financial firms from the Fortune
500 level on down. So far, however, 60 percent of Alterna-track's
business clients have called the firm unsolicited, asking for a
presentation of services and job candidates.
   ``One major company we've talked to said it is losing three
times as many women as men in the 30-35 age category,'' gutting its
middle management ranks, Moore said.
   But Moore and Cook aren't robbing Merrill Lynch to pay Shearson.
On the contrary, most of the women they place come from large firms
but are teamed up with much smaller firms that need top talent but
can't pay top salaries on a full-time basis.
   One recent match put Cynthia McClintock, a former associate in
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s corporate finance department, at
Ampton BCS Investments L.P., a merchant bank with fewer than a
dozen employees.
   ``The problem with a small service business like this is that
you kill yourself by adding expensive staff,'' said partner
Laurence Strenger, who selected McClintock from five Alterna-track
candidates.
   ``It would be imprudent if we started adding people at
multi-hundred-thousand-dollar salaries,'' he said. ``Here we have
someone with a Harvard MBA on a piece-work basis. It's marvelous.''
   Strenger has called McClintock to work on three more projects.
For McClintock, whose first child is due in June, it meant getting
a head start on ``part-time work that will make sense later on.''
   For their efforts, Moore and Cook receive 30 percent of a placed
applicant's annual compensation. It may not sound like much, but
the average woman in their pool is earning about $150,000 a year.
   That average candidate is about 35 years old, has been on her
job for about eight years and has between one and two children.
   Cook noted that it's usually after the second child that women
just give up on their jobs. Cook resigned from Goldman Sachs just
before the market crash of 1987 when her youngest was 2 with a
feeling of ``guilt that I was not giving as much to the firm and
also not having enough time with my kids.''
   Moore and Cook aren't sure how the recession at major investment
houses will affect their business. They know, however, that ``the
pressures have multiplied five-fold on Wall Street,'' Moore said,
stressing working mothers even more.
   This year they have placed five professionals and expect to
place another five in the next few weeks, three of whom will cover
for women taking maternity leave from a major consumer products
company. When those women return, Alterna-track's candidates are
likely to share jobs with them.
   By midyear, Moore said she expects to have placed up to 30
professionals. To keep pace, Alterna-track has hired a director and
will open a Los Angeles office in June. Other sites under
consideration are London and Chicago, but Moore said there's no
reason the company can't go nationwide.
   Despite the expansion, Moore says she'll still have time to take
an afternoon off to go play tennis with her 9-year-old son, and
Cook and can still go ice skating in Manhattan's Central Park with
her boys.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Share prices finished slightly higher Thursday
after a lackluster session on London's Stock Exchange.
   Investors were content to sit on the sidelines, waiting for a
new trading account to begin Friday afternoon, traders said. The
exchange divides trading into two-week and three-week periods for
accounting purposes.
   Traders said investors still were considering the ramifications
of the Tokyo market's gyrations.
   ``Players haven't got a clear picture of what's happening in
Tokyo, so they're saying they'd rather not risk the money,'' said a
chief dealer.
   Wall Street offered the London market little leadership, with
the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials up just a few points as
London trading came to a close.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 7.9
points, or 0.4 percent, at 2,239.5 at the close, its best level for
the session and well above its low of 2,222.0.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was up 6.6 points at 1,756.3
at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 3.51 points
to close at 1,209.28.
   Volume was a moderate 499.5 million shares, down from 505.4
million on Wednesday.

<HEAD>Survey: U.S. CEOs More Concerned About Domestic Competition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than three-quarters of chief executive
officers of U.S. companies contacted in a survey said their
greatest competitive threat comes from other domestic companies,
not foreign businesses.
   About 70 percent of the more than 1,100 CEOs polled on behalf of
Continental Bank of Chicago also said their companies'
competitiveness is most strongly influenced by factors within their
control.
   About 51 percent of the executives said U.S. business is at
least as competitive, if not more so, with foreign business as it
was 10 years ago. Looking ahead, seven of 10 CEOs said they
believed U.S. business will maintain or improve its competitive
position with foreign business over the next 10 years.
   About 75 percent of those surveyed believe U.S. companies are as
good as or better than foreign competition in terms of marketing
expertise and management quality. Two-thirds said U.S. product
quality is superior, while the American work force was seen as
stronger than foreign counterparts by 60 percent of executives.
   Foreign companies were judged better than or equal to U.S.
businesses only in terms of operating costs, by 66 percent of CEOs,
and product price, by 65 percent.
   Fewer than one-third of the executives said they believed their
companies were likely to establish joint marketing or distribution
agreements with foreign companies within the next five years. About
23 percent already have such agreements.
   Sixty percent of the CEOs said foreign investment in the United
States has helped improve U.S. competitiveness.
   Nearly all the executives said a low level of worker training
and education is the most serious obstacle to building the United
States' competitive strength, followed by a short-term focus on
earnings by companies.
   The survey of 1,136 CEOs of companies with sales of under $10
million to more than $5 billion was conducted during 1989's fourth
quarter by Beta Research Corp. of Syosset, N.Y. The survey has a
statistical margin of error of plus or minus 1.35 percentage points.

   Stock prices struggled to a small gain today
after a rumored financial storm in Tokyo failed to materialize.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.86 to 2,725.23 by
3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers slightly outnumbered losers in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 712 up, 701 down and 553
unchanged.
   Prices of U.S. stocks pulled back on Tuesday amid talk that the
battered Japanese market might be hit with a fresh wave of selling
overnight.
   As it turned out, Tokyo stock prices did decline sharply in
early trading, but then recovered most of their losses.
   Analysts said that calmed whatever fears had been stirring that
pressure on stocks in Japan might soon start to exert an increasing
influence in other markets around the world.
   At the same time, brokers said, traders in this country were
proceeding carefully in advance of Friday's monthly report on the
employment situation.
   Among Japanese issues traded on U.S. exchanges, Matsushita
Electrical climbed 7~ to 144{; Kyocera 3} to 100, and Honda Motor
1\ to 23&lsqb;.
   Tandem Computers led the active list, down 4&lsqb; at 23&lsqb;. The
company said revenues for the fiscal quarter that ended last
weekend fell short of its target.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, up } at
41\; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up { at 41}; General Electric,
up &rsqb; at 64|, and International Paper, up &rsqb; at 51\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Gain On Export Strength; Grains Close Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures closed slightly higher Thursday
on the Chicago Board of Trade amid export speculation, while grain
futures finished mixed in a relatively quiet session.
   Soybean exports from Brazil to Europe have been slowed by
confusion over economic reforms launched last month in the South
American country, prompting speculation that importers may turn to
the United States to meet their needs.
   In other export developments, analysts said the Soviet Union is
rumored to have bought recently as much as 1 million metric tons of
corn.
   They said some of those purchases may have been reflected in
Agriculture Department announcements this week of a total of
220,000 metric tons of U.S. corn sold to unknown destinations.
   By law, the USDA must report export sales of at least 100,000
tons of grain.
   Joel Karlin, a grain-market analyst with Research Department
Inc. in Chicago, said the Soviets may have made other purchases in
amounts smaller than 100,000 tons.
   Wheat futures fell slightly after three days of strong gains
linked to fears of a weekend freeze in the U.S. winter wheat region
and concerns about tight deliverable supplies.
   At the close of trading, wheat futures were } cent to 2{ cents
lower with the contract for delivery in May at $3.69 a bushel; corn
was 1 cent lower to } cent higher with May at $2.69 a bushel; oats
were \ cent to 1 cent lower with May at $1.52 a bushel; soybeans
were unchanged to 3 cents higher with May at $5.94 a bushel.

<HEAD>Stock Speculators, Manipulators Hurt Badly by Falling Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARI YAMAGUCHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Asssociated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock speculators, long a shadow force in the Tokyo
Stock Exchange, have been hurt badly by the market's recent heavy
plunges, traders said Thursday.
   Rumors that financially strapped speculators have in turn pushed
small brokerages close to bankruptcy caused a temporary plunge of
more than 1,000 points Thursday in the exchange's chief index.
   One broker said more than 30 minor brokerages had been left with
massive losses _ $190 million according to news reports _ by stock
manipulators who were unable or unwilling to pay for their buy
orders. The broker, who refused to be named, said his firm had been
informed of the problem by stock exchange authorities.
   Traders said the rumor sparked Thursday morning's selloff in
which the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average plunge more than 3.83
percent from Wednesday's close.
   Exchange officials later denied the bankruptcy rumor in an
unusual quickly called news conference. Aided by support from large
securities and investment trust firms, the Nikkei rebounded to
finish the day down 193.88 points, or 0.68 percent, at 28,249.06.
   Speculators in the Tokyo Stock Exchange generally remain behind
the scenes, buying up shares of targeted companies to push up the
price _ sometimes with the use of false rumors _ and then dumping
them to make profits. The number of such investors is unknown.
   Some of these speculators are believed to have close links with
gangsters. The Daily Yomiuri newspaper said Thursday that Japanese
gangster syndicates have raked in huge profits by investing in
stocks.
   Traders said many of the speculators were going broke because
they had bought stocks using borrowed money repayable at high rates
of interest.
   Some speculators have begun using a tactic called ``teppo,'' or
gun _ the placement of false buy orders for their own shares in an
attempt to get rid of plunging stocks that nobody else wants to
buy. The speculators never intend to pay for the shares, dealers
say.
   ``Some securities companies have lost money by buying shares for
imaginary figures without cash payment,'' said Hisao Yasuda, a
trader with Nikko Securities Co. ``This could be the end of the
speculators.''
   Yasumasa Shinagawa, a trader with Yamaichi Securities Co.,
called the Nikkei's early plunge Thursday a sign that speculator
groups were collapsing because of financial trouble stemming from
the market's nearly 27 percent drop so far this year.
   At the end of Thursday's trading, about 24 percent of the
approximately 1,160 issues on the stock exchange's first section
still had no price quotations, indicating that no trades had
occurred during the day, said Nikko's Yasuda.
   He said many of the untraded issues had been manipulated by
speculator groups.
   Issues that are the focus of speculators can be easily
identified by wild price movements unrelated to market trends, said
Katsumi Nishikido, a dealer with Nippon Kangyo Kakuaru Securities
Co.
   Traders say speculators have targeted about 200 issues listed on
the first section of the exchange, about 70 of which are among the
Nikkei's 225 issues.
   The price of Kagoshima Bank shares, identified as one such
issue, ended at 860 points Thursday, down from almost 3,000 points
in early March.
   Under Japanese rules, payment for stock orders is not due for
four days. As a result, brokerages are vulnerable to losses from
speculative excesses.
   ``Everybody remembers the Black Monday stock crash. They all
expected the market to rebound like it did then,'' said one broker.
As a result, the market rapidly became overbought, he said.
   Ordinarily, clients are given thorough initial credit checks,
but follow-ups are rare, the broker said.
   Traders said smaller, unlicensed securities firms could go broke
in the current market because they are more likely to be involved
with risky investors, whereas major securities firms generally
avoid speculators.
   A Nomura Securities official said major brokerage houses don't
process buy orders from speculator groups unless they receive cash
payment.
   The ``big four'' securities companies _Nomura, Yamaichi, Daiwa
and Nikko _ are believed to control about 60 percent of the shares
traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   Of 272 securities firms with licenses from the Finance Ministry,
124, including 22 foreign firms, are members of the exchange.
   An official in the exchange's investigative arm said, ``The
issue is basically a problem between securities firms and their
customers. We are trying not to make a big fuss about it. ...If we
did, it might make the market performance even worse.''
   Takaaki Okada, spokesman for the Securities Dealers' Association
of Japan, ruled out the possibility of bankruptcies of accredited
Japanese financial institutions because ``the Finance Ministry will
offer to take some actions by the time a company gets into
trouble.''

   Many in Japan's financial markets are not expecting
much help for the falling yen from Saturday's meeting in Paris of
the finance chiefs of seven advanced industrial nations.
   In the past, Japan's trading partners have worried about a cheap
yen, which makes Japanese goods less expensive and more competitive
abroad, contributing to this nation's huge trade surpluses.
   Now, Japan is concerned that the weaker yen is raising dangers
of domestic inflation by making its imported fuel and raw materials
cost more.
   But analysts say Japan's partners in the Group of Seven are
likely to do little more than state a general commitment to stable
exchange rates.
   While a lower dollar tends to make U.S. goods more competitive
against Japanese products, they add, the United States has been
concentrating recently on other approaches to narrowing its $49
billion deficit in trade with Japan. To help fight its own
inflation dangers, they say, the United States is happy with a
strong dollar.
   ``Nobody except Japan is worried about the weak yen,'' said
Minori Takeuchi of Chemical Bank.
   ``West Germany would prefer a strong mark ahead of currency
union'' with East Germany, she added.
   In addition to Japan, the United States and West Germany, the
others in the group are Britain, France, Italy and Canada.
   Just in case the meeting does decide on action to shore up the
yen, which has fallen about 10 percent this year, Tokyo market
players have been reducing their dollar holdings in the last three
days.
   The dollar closed Thursday at 157.90 yen, down more than two yen
from its closing of 159.95 yen on Monday, its highest in more than
three years.
   ``Market players began to reduce their dollar holdings just in
case the G-7 meeting comes up with something they had not
predicted, although nothing special is expected at the moment,''
Mamoru Tabata, a dealer with Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank, said Wednesday.
   On the other hand, there has been speculation that the United
States was declining to support the yen as part of attempts to
pressure Japan into making concessions in this week's trade talks
in Washington.
   In those talks, Ms. Takeuchi said, the United States is pressing
the Japanese government to spend more on public works, figuring
that ``if the government spends more, the United States can export
more'' here.
   Japan's central bank has been using interest rate increases to
try to head off inflation and support the yen. Higher interest
rates tend to make a nation's currency more attractive, although
they also tend to discourage stock investment - a problem for Japan
amid a stock market plunge of more than 25 percent so far this year.
   In its latest move, on March 20, the central bank raised its
charge for loans to commercial banks by one percentage point to
5.25 percent.
   Citing a possible reason for the Group of Seven to support the
yen, Yoichi Itoh, chief corporate service officer at Sumitomo Trust
and Banking, said, ``I think the United States might judge that
higher Japanese interest rates might force U.S. interest rates up,
and that some kind of currency stability will be necessary to stop
Japanese interest rates from rising further.''
   At the end of March, the dollar rose 6.43 yen in nine trading
days. Foreign exchange traders said the Tokyo market was
disappointed that Japanese Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's
meeting with U.S. Treasury Nicholas Brady on March 23 had produced
no tangible new measure to support the yen.
   At a news briefing on Tuesday, Hashimoto said the dramatic
changes in Europe, rather than exchange rates, would be the main
focus of the Group of Seven meeting. He said the meeting was not
being held to draft policies to deal with the recent instability in
Japanese markets.
   At a news conference last week, Yasushi Mieno, governor of the
Bank of Japan, said it was hard to understand why the yen was
falling when Japanese interest rates, adjusted for inflation, were
higher than U.S. interest rates and Japan still was running large
trade surpluses.
   He suggested that tensions in the Soviet Union and developments
in Europe were boosting the dollar, considered a safe haven
currency.

   The Treasury Department sold $9.8 billion of the bills at an
average discount rate of 7.72 percent, down from 7.76 percent at
the last comparable auction on March 8.
   The rates were the lowest since Feb. 13, when the one-year bills

   Stock prices hovered in a narrow range today
after a rumored financial storm in Tokyo failed to materialize.
   Prices of U.S. stocks pulled back on Tuesday amid talk that the
battered Japanese market might be hit with a fresh wave of selling
overnight.
   As it turned out, Tokyo stock prices did decline sharply in
early trading, but then recovered most of their losses.
   Analysts said that calmed whatever fears had been stirring that
pressure on stocks in Japan might start to exert an increasing
influence in other markets around the world.
   But at the same time, brokers said, traders in this country were
proceeding carefully in advance of Friday's monthly report on the
employment situation.

<HEAD>Upjohn Gets OK to Sell Anti-Baldness Drug for Women in Britain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KALAMAZOO, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Upjohn Co. has received approval
from the British government to begin pitching its anti-baldness
drug to women, company officials said Wednesday.
   Studies show that Regaine, sold as Rogaine in the United States
and Canada, is at least as effective in treating hair loss in women
as in men, Upjohn officials said.
   The 2 percent minoxidil solution is sold by prescription for men
in 63 countries; about 20 of them also have approved it for women.
   Upjohn is awaiting approval from the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration to sell Rogaine for women in the United States.
   Company spokeswoman Laura Harwin said the solution and
application are the same for men and women. The approval, received
Tuesday, just allows the company to broaden its marketing.
   In the United States, an estimated 30 million men and 20 million
women experience hereditary hair loss. The cause of hair thinning
in men and women is often the same: age, heredity and the presence
of the hormone testosterone, Harwin said.
   The results differ, however. While many men eventually are left
with a horseshoe-shaped fringe of hair, women usually see a general
thinning over the top of the head.
   Marketing experts at Upjohn estimate about 34 percent of women
between the ages of 20 and 60 experience at least mild hair
thinning.
   Though Upjohn does not release sales figures for individual
products, analysts say the drug has been slow to catch on among men
in the United States, partly because of its mixed results. It has
been shown in testing to grow hair in about 39 percent of young men
who are in the early stages of balding.

<HEAD>US Saves Little, Some Others Even Less</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans often are accused of having lost the
Yankee love of thrift, but the International Monetary Fund says
people in some other countries are saving even less _ notably in
prosperous northern Europe.
   It predicted that the trend will continue as the world's
population ages. Older people have less to save for.
   ``The negative trend in national saving rates experienced by all
the major industrial countries since the early to mid-1970s has
raised serious concerns about the prospects for strong and
sustainable growth in the world economy,'' said the latest issue of
the ``IMF Survey,'' dated March 19. It appears every two weeks.
   The warning is based on a report by a team under Bijan B.
Aghelvi, senior advisor in the fund's research department at its
headquarters in Washington.
   When people put money into their bank accounts, the banks relend
it to industry for building the factories that will produce more
goods and jobs in the future. If savings are too small, industry
has to borrow from other countries.
   Governments also save _ or, more often, ``dis-save'' by going
further into debt. When a government spends more than it collects
in taxes, it has to borrow from the savings of its citizens or from
other countries. Its taxpayers then have to pay interest on the
debt.
   The United States is a prime example on both counts. Americans
of the future will have to pay interest to other countries on the
billions being borrowed by Americans today.
   The most recent figures come from the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) in Paris.
   In 1988 the average American household saved only $4.40 out of
every $100 left after it paid taxes. But Americans were not the
greatest spendthrifts. The average Swedish household did not save
at all: it drew on past savings or went into debt at the rate of
$3.60 for every $100 it earned. ``Dis-savings'' of $1.20 per $100
were also reported from average Norwegian families and $1.40 from
those in Finland.
   Dutch households saved only $2 of every $100.
   Of the major industrial countries the Japanese were the top
savers: $15.20 out of $100. Even the thrifty Japanese have loosened
up: in 1976 their figure was $23.20.
   The average West German family saved $15.10 of every $100 in
1975 and only $12.60 in 1988.
   Another study sponsored by the fund warns that a country's
capital will be consumed unless money is set aside to replace it,
and more must be put aside as the population grows.

<HEAD>Publisher: Loss of Features Caused Circulation Drop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA TOLLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The publisher of the Dallas Times Herald
testified Wednesday that the paper lost thousands of readers and
advertising strength when the rival Dallas Morning News struck a
deal for 26 syndicated columns and comics that had appeared in the
Times Herald for years.
   Publisher John Buzzetta was the first witness in the Times
Herald's $33 million antitrust suit against The Dallas Morning News
over transfer of the Universal Press Syndicate columns.
   After The Morning News' parent company, A.H. Belo Corp. formed a
joint venture with the Kansas City-based syndicate last year, UPS
canceled the Times Herald's contract for the features.
   ``I was shocked,'' Buzzetta testified, referring to the
cancelation notice. ``I'd never seen something like this happen.
   ``Here, in one fell swoop, I was going to lose some of the best
features this newspaper had published for years and years. I
thought I was going to have some serious losses.''
   Buzzetta tallied the circulation losses at 9,000 to 10,000 daily
readers and more than 15,000 on Sunday.
   The Times Herald had been posting increases in circulation
before Universal Press canceled the features, said Buzzetta, who
bought the paper in 1988.
   But afterward the paper began to lose ``loyal readers'' faithful
to such features as Dear Abby, Erma Bombeck and Doonesbury, which
were moved to The Morning News.
   ``If you lose features, it means you lose some really loyal
readers, and circulation goes down,'' he said.
   If circulation declines, advertising follows, he said. The
newspaper gets 90 percent of its revenue from advertising sales and
10 percent from newspaper sales, he said.
   Court documents indicate The Morning News attracts 60 percent of
the circulation and newspaper advertising in Dallas.
   Buzzetta said a newspaper economist hired by the Times Herald
quantified the damage of losing the features at $33 million.
   The Times Herald also is seeking unspecified punitive damages
from Belo and The Morning News.
   In opening statements, Morning News attorneys maintained the
Times Herald has made circulation gains since losing the features.
   Buzzetta said some of the circulation losses were recouped
through special promotions, particularly a lottery. But he said the
promotions have been expensive _ costing $1.5 million so far _ and
do not have the same lasting power to attract and keep ``loyal
readers'' that features have.
   The Times Herald attorneys said they will try to prove The
Morning News conspired to lure the features from the Times Herald
in hopes of destroying newspaper competition in the Dallas market.
   Morning News lawyers, however, maintain it was just fair
competition to purchase rights to the comics and columns.
   The joint venture, called Universal-Belo, also is developing
television shows based on syndicate comic characters.
   The Times Herald has challenged that agreement in a pending
request for the Federal Communications Commission to revoke the
license of Belo's WFAA-TV, the top-rated station in Dallas.

   Assets of the nation's 507 money market mutual
funds fell $293.6 million in the latest week to $390.49 billion,
the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The decline in the seven-day period ended Wednesday, followed a
$1.36 billion drop to $390.78 billion the previous week. That total
originally was reported as $391.62 billion but the Washington-based
mutual fund trade group subsequently revised it down further to
reflect asset adjustments in newly reporting funds.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 246 general purpose funds rose $226.0 million to $133.23
billion, assets of 102 broker-dealer funds dropped $570.1 million
to $165.79 billion, and assets of 159 institutional funds rose
$50.5 million to $91.47 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.67 percent from 7.69 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 7.67 percent from 7.66 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
45 days, unchanged from last week, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan associations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts remained
unchanged at 6.25 percent as of Wednesday compared with a week
earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, also was unchanged, at 5.05 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.88
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 7.89 the
previous week. Yields were 8.03 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 8.02
percent; 8.05 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 8.04 percent; and
8.09 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.08 percent.

   The energy futures market lost more ground
Thursday as concerns about overproduction by OPEC depressed prices
of crude oil and other petroleum products.
   Gasoline was the biggest loser. The contract for May delivery of
unleaded gasoline settled 1.57 cents lower at 63.29 cents a gallon
on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after falling 1.02 cents
Wednesday. Other contract months also lost more than a penny a
gallon.
   Another refined petroleum product traded on the Merc, May home
heating oil, slipped 0.71 cent to 53.31 cents a gallon. The
contract tumbled 1.48 cents on Wednesday.
   The May contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude, settled at $19.43 per 42-gallon barrel, after
losing 52 cents in Wednesday's session.
   Meanwhile, natural gas for June delivery closed at $1.615 per
million British thermal units, down from $1.620 Wednesday. The
contract began trading on the Merc earlier this week.
   Bob Baker, a senior energy analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., attributed the drop in prices to reports that the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was producing as much
as 24 million barrels of oil a day, far above its 22-million-barrel
daily quota.
   ``We're not going to see $20 oil with this level of
production,'' he said.

   The dollar finished mixed Thursday in dull
trading on world currency markets.
   Gold prices fell in the United States after rising overseas. On
the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $374.80 a troy ounce, down $2.30 from late
Wednesday. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for
gold of $375 an ounce, down $2.75.
   The dollar's only significant move came against the Japanese
yen. The dollar lost one yen against the Japanese currency in Asian
trading and fell further as trading shifted to Europe and later to
the United States.
   Dealers stressed that trading was quiet overall. Investors
remained on the sidelines while awaiting the weekend meeting of the
Group of Seven industrial nations and Friday's release of U.S.
unemployment figures for March.
   Finance officials from the United States, Japan, West Germany,
Britain, France, Italy and Canada were planning to meet in Paris to
review international exchange rates.
   ``There was a feeling earlier in the week that there would be no
new policy initiatives (coming out of the meeting), but now the
market's getting a little more nervous,'' said Ron Holzer, a vice
president at Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank in Chicago.
   Dealers said they had expected the dollar's decline against the
yen following speculation that monetary authorities might take
action to prop up the sagging Japanese currency.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 157.90 yen, down 1 yen from
Wednesday. Later in London, the dollar was quoted lower at 157.74
yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 157.50 yen, down from 158.88
yen on Wednesday.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.6427 from $1.6416 late
Wednesday. In New York, one pound cost $1.6420, more expensive than
Wednesday's $1.6406.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.6997 West German marks, up from
1.6995; 1.5015 Swiss francs, down from 1.5040; 5.7150 French
francs, up from 5.7095; 1,249.50 Italian lire, up from 1,249.00;
and 1.1684 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1673.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.6997 West German marks, down from
1.6999; 1.5010 Swiss francs, down from 1.5060; 5.7155 French
francs, up from 5.7120; 1.9123 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9115;
1,250.50 Italian lire, up from 1,249.50; and 1.1685 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.1672.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $377 a troy ounce, up
from $374.50 late Wednesday. In Zurich, Switzerland, the metal rose
to a closing bid of $376.50 an ounce from $374.50 late Wednesday.
   Gold was not traded in Hong Kong, where all financial
institutions were closed Thursday for the Chinese Ching Ming, or
Remembrance of Ancestors Day, holiday. They will reopen Friday.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery finished at $5.141 a troy ounce, down from
$5.160 on Wednesday. But in London, the metal rose to a late bid
price of $5.18 an ounce from $5.02.

   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended March 26, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,273.4 billion from $3,268.3 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,070.3 billion from $4,067.1 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $804.8 billion from $802.5 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 6.2 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 is 2.9 percent, which is within the
Fed's target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The Fed has not
set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,248.2 billion, a 6.4
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,057.1 billion, up 3.1 percent, while M1
rose 5 percent to an average of $799.8 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks fell $1.75 billion.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $244 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from
$140 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves averaged $928
million in the two weeks ended Wednesday, up from $575 million in
the previous two-week period.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $302 billion in the two-week period ended April
4, down from $304.2 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Broker Association Rule Out for Comment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal futures regulators on Thursday took
another step toward regulating groups of traders known as ``broker
associations,'' to prevent possible trading abuses like those
uncovered in Chicago last year.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission voted unanimously, 5-0,
to submit for public comment, a proposed rule that would provide a
legal definition of broker associations and require them to
register with the exchange at which they do business.
   Broker associations have been loosely defined as formal or
informal groups of futures traders formed to provide more capital
to finance trades and more people to handle them.
   But the CFTC's Division of Trading and Markets concluded in a
study disclosed last January that broker associations ``may
increase the potential for certain types of trading abuses.''
   The study was an outgrowth of an undercover investigation of
trading at the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange _ the nation's two largest futures exchanges _ which
resulted in the indictment of more than 40 traders.
   Only five of the 13 futures exchanges have rules defining broker
associations, and of those, only three: the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange; the Commodity Exchange or COMEX and the Coffee, Sugar &amp;
Cocoa Exchange, require broker associations to register.
   CFTC staffers believe, and commission members agreed, that
keeping tabs on broker associations will help them deter abuses in
the trading pits.
   ``I believe very strongly that we identify and register these
groups and I also agree that it gives a big assist and augmentation
to our surveillance program to have this information,'' said
Commissioner Kalo A. Hineman.
   In other matters, the CFTC, which oversees the futures markets,
voted to seek public comment on a clarified commission
interpretation of what types of ``hybrid'' financial products are
exempt from CFTC regulations.
   Hybrids contain elements of both futures contracts and
securities. The interpretation, issued last year, specifies what
types of institutions and products are exempt from CFTC regulation.
   As defined in the CFTC's proposed rule, ``broker association''
refers to two or more exchange members who share: responsibility
for executing customer orders, profits or losses from trading
activities or access to each other's unfilled customer orders.
   The rule would bar participation in the trading activities of a
broker association unless the association is registered with the
market or exchange.
   Interested parties would have 60 days to comment on the proposed
rule before the CFTC takes a final vote on implementing it.

<HEAD>Avon Miffed by New Chartwell Stock Purchases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Avon Products Inc., which late last month
reached a truce with the investor group Chartwell Associates L.P.,
said Thursday that Chartwell's recent additional purchases of its
stock were inappropriate.
   The Avon board responded to Chartwell's stock purchases by
voting Thursday to amend the cosmetics company's share rights
anti-takeover plan. The change essentially is meant to discourage
Chartwell from buying more Avon stock.
   The amendment lowers the threshold at which an element of the
rights plan becomes effective. It will apply when anyone acquires
more than 12.5 percent of Avon's outstanding voting stock, rather
than 20 percent.
   Chartwell had said earlier in a filing to the Securities and
Exchange Commission that it raised its stake in Avon's common stock
to 16 percent. Its holding of Avon's voting stock expanded to about
12 percent.
   The group, which includes affiliates of Mary Kay Corp., oil heir
Gordon Getty and the Fisher real estate family of New York, said it
bought more than 3.45 million shares of Avon common stock between
March 27 and April 4, increasing its total holding to 9.05 million.
The partnership said it has spent more than $312 million from
working capital to acquire its Avon interest.
   Avon said in a letter to Chartwell that the purchases could
interfere with an agreement under which Avon plans to nominate two
Chartwell candidates to its board at its annual meeting May 3. In
return for the board seats, Chartwell had agreed to drop its proxy
fight to win four seats on Avon's board of directors.
   Under the settlement, the Avon directors are establishing a
committee to consider ways of boosting value for Avon stockholders.
Members of the special panel will be James E. Preston, Avon's
chairman and chief executive officer, three incumbent members of
the Avon board and the two Chartwell nominees.
   The panel will examine alternatives to maximize value, such as a
recapitalization, asset sales, an outright sale of Avon or a
leveraged buyout.
   Preston said in the letter that the board is concerned
Chartwell's new purchases will ``prejudice the ability of the
special committee to consider all the alternatives'' in carrying
out its assigned task.
   ``In addition, the board believes that such purchases will have
adverse consequences on our operating businesses and could be
unfair to other shareholders,'' Preston said.
   The letter was sent to Richard Fisher, a member of Chartwell. It
was released by Avon's headquarters in New York.

<HEAD>Computer Company Drops CFC Chemical in Cleaning Process</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GLENN ADAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Digital Equipment Corp. announced Thursday
it has developed a new process to clean computer circuit boards
that does not use chemicals believed to damage the Earth's ozone
layer.
   Company officials making the announcement at Digital's Augusta
plant, where the process was developed, said Digital is making the
technology available to other companies as a gesture of Digital's
environmental commitment. The Maynard, Mass.-based company the
nation's second-largest computer maker after International Business
Machines Corp.
   Even before Thursday's announcement, some companies expressed
interest in the new process, Augusta plant manager Bob Jackson told
reporters and business representatives.
   In the past, Digital, like many computer makers, used solvents
containing chlorofluorocarbons to remove dirt and residues left by
the manufacturing process from printed circuit boards. The debris
was removed through chemical reactions with the solvent, but CFC's
were released into the air when the solvent evaporated.
   Digital has developed a process in which minute droplets of
water are sprayed on the circuit boards from rotating arms. A key
to the technology is a nozzle reducing the size of the droplets,
which are able to clean underneath components.
   The circuit boards are washed with a light detergent, then
rinsed twice and blown dry.
   The process is ``exceptionally simple,'' said Dana Duncan, an
engineering supervisor and one of those who developed the
technology.
   Equipment for the process has been installed at Digital plants
in Augusta and Hong Kong, and plants in Singapore and Taiwan are
being retrofitted, said Mike Hasty, a process engineering manager
who also worked on the technique.
   Digital is providing information on the new technology through
the Industry Cooperative for Ozone Layer Protection, a joint
venture between the federal Environmental Protection Agency and
industry. The venture promotes worldwide reduction of
chlorofluorocarbons.
   Digital said it has been working on the CFC-reducing process for
two years.
   Reduction of CFCs, which are also used in refrigeration, foam
blowing and aerosols, will aid in efforts to counter global
warming, known as the ``greenhouse effect,'' scientists say. CFCs
are believed to break down the protective ozone layer surrounding
the Earth.

<HEAD>Two Investment Firms Buy Big Chunks of Northrop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   B-2 bomber builder Northrop Corp. says two
investment firms have purchased large amounts of its stock, which
has dropped from the $50-per-share level in the mid-1980s to $15.
   The firm Sanford C. Bernstein has acquired 8.1 percent of
Northrop's 47 million common shares and Delaware Management Co. 6.3
percent, according to proxy material mailed to shareholders in
advance of Northrop's annual meeting May 16.
   It was unclear whether Bernstein and Delaware Management were
holding shares in trust. Bernstein has sole voting power over only
half its 3.8 million shares and Delaware management over only 1.3
million shares of its 2.9 million shares, the proxy said.
   The aerospace company has been considered vulnerable to takeover
because of its depressed stock price, although analysts said a
buyout would be complicated because insiders hold large blocks of
stock.
   The holdings ``would make it very hard for any outsider to mount
an unfriendly takeover,'' said Wolfgang Demisch, the head of
research for UBS Securities in New York.
   Northrop finished at $15 a share Wednesday on the New York Stock
Exchange, unchanged from Tuesday's close.
   At that price, the 47 million common shares could be purchased
for $705 million _ a bit more than the $530 million pricetag for a
single radar-evading, bat-winged B-2 stealth bomber.

<HEAD>Oil Futures Sink, Reflecting Large Supplies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Petroleum futures prices fell sharply Thursday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, dropping for the third straight day amid
perceptions that gasoline and crude oil supplies are outstripping
demand.
   On other commodity markets, soybeans surged while grains were
mixed; copper futures fell; precious metals retreated; and
livestock and meat futures were mostly higher.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures settled 26 cents to 43
cents lower with the contract for delivery in May at $19.43 a
barrel; heating oil was .71 cent to 1.16 cents lower with May at
53.31 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.05 cents to 1.71
cents lower with May at 63.29 cents a gallon.
   Analysts said there was no change in supply-and-demand factors
Thursday to account for the selloff. But traders have turned
increasingly bearish amid signs of a rising crude oil production
and steady stockpiling of gasoline.
   Indications of apparently strong gasoline demand helped support
the petroleum markets last month, but some analysts now believe the
market misinterpreted the signals.
   ``It appears to me that some of the strong demand of the past
couple of weeks was simply some inventory building,'' said Jim
Ritterbusch, energy analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in Chicago.
   With many refineries now gearing up to increase gasoline
production for the summer driving season, he said, ``we could be
flooding the market with gasoline a month or two down the road.''
   Ritterbusch said OPEC crude oil production is approaching an
eight-year high, which is one of the factors that caused crude oil
for near-term delivery to slip below $20 a barrel Wednesday. Most
market experts foresee steady or falling crude prices through the
spring.
   Soybean futures surged into the close of trading on the Chicago
Board of Trade amid expectations for new export sales, while grain
futures finished mixed.
   Soybean exports from Brazil to Europe have been slowed by
confusion over economic reforms launched last month in the South
American country, prompting speculation that importers may turn to
the United States to meet their needs.
   In other export developments, analysts said the Soviet Union is
rumored to have bought as much as 1 million metric tons of corn
recently. They said some of those purchases may have been reflected
in Agriculture Department announcements this week of a total of
221,000 metric tons of U.S. corn sold to unknown destinations.
   Wheat futures settled } cent lower to \ cent higher with May at
$3.70 a bushel; corn was { cent lower to 2 cents higher with May at
$2.70\ a bushel; oats were \ cent lower to { cent higher with May
at $1.52} a bushel; soybeans were 3{ cents to 5{ cents higher with
May at $5.96{ a bushel.
   Copper futures extended their losses on New York's Commodity
Exchange despite reports from Peru indicating a 25-day-old strike
against the Southern Peru Copper Corp. had not been settled.
   News reports on Wednesday said the strike was over, but those
accounts were later denied by the government and the company, which
said it was still in the process of presenting a proposal to
workers.
   Copper futures finished 1.55 cents lower to .05 cent higher with
April at $1.2195 a pound.
   Gold and silver futures fell on the Commodity Exchange in
profit-taking after two days of gains.
   Gold settled $2.20 to $2.50 lower with April at $374.80 a troy
ounce; silver was 1.9 cents to 2.2 cents lower with April at $5.141
a troy ounce.
   Cattle futures rallied strongly late in the session on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange on reports of higher prices paid for
steers in western Kansas and light sales of fed cattle. Pork
futures finished mixed in lackluster trading.
   Live cattle were .25 cent to .62 cent higher with April at 78.95
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .67 cent higher with
April at 82.80 cents a pound; live hogs were .22 cent lower to .20
cent higher with April at 54.85 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were unchanged to .50 cent higher with May at 55.45 cents a pound.

   Stock prices drifted through a mixed session
Thursday after a rumored financial storm in Tokyo failed to
materialize.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had been down
17.34 points Wednesday, rose 1.80 to 2,721.17.
   Declining issues slightly outnumbered advances in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 703 up, 744
down and 540 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 144.17 million
shares, against 159.54 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 175.91 million shares.
   Prices of U.S. stocks pulled back on Wednesday amid talk that
the battered Japanese market might be hit with a fresh wave of
selling overnight.
   As it turned out, Tokyo stock prices did decline sharply in
early trading, but then recovered most of their losses.
   Analysts said that calmed some fears that pressure on stocks in
Japan might soon start to exert an increasing influence in other
markets around the world.
   But at the same time, brokers said, traders in this country were
proceeding carefully in advance of Friday's monthly report on the
employment situation.
   Estimates in the financial world call for an increase of perhaps
150,000 to 180,000 in nonfarm payroll employment for March, which
would be considerably smaller than the gains reported for January
and February.
   Among Japanese issues traded on U.S. exchanges, Matsushita
Electrical climbed 7~ to 144{; Kyocera 3} to 100; Hitachi 7\ to
104\, and Honda Motor 1\ to 23&lsqb;.
   Tandem Computers led the active list, down 4} at 22{. The
company said revenues for the fiscal quarter that ended last
weekend fell short of its target.
   Bank stocks were also notably weak, faced with what analysts
described as the prospect of a long and arduous review by
government regulators of lending practices in the industry.
   Bankamerica dropped 1\ to 26&rsqb;; First Chicago 1 to 29; Citizens &amp;

Coca-Cola, up &lsqb; at 77{; International Paper, up &rsqb; at 51\, and
General Electric, up &lsqb; at 63&rsqb;.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $4.37 billion, or 0.13
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped .16 to 187.15.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose .03 to 396.05, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was down .36 at 340.73.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market lost

General Board</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Thursday enjoined Torchmark Corp.
from soliciting proxies for a slate of nominees for the board of
American General Corp., a rival insurer.
   American General argued that Torchmark failed to comply with the
advance notice provisions of American General's bylaws and should
not be allowed to solicit proxies. American General contends the
nominations closed March 3.
   U.S. District Court Judge David Hittner granted the preliminary
injunction Thursday.
   Torchmark said Monday it would seek control of American
General's board after it withdrew a $6.4 billion bid to purchase
the Houston firm.
   ``American General said that its board would not consider our
proposal until after its annual meeting on May 2, so the annual
meeting has become a referendum on whether shareholders want the
board to seriously consider proposals like ours,'' Torchmark
President John T. Rotenstreich said Monday.
   American General had assets of $32.1 billion and common
shareholders' equity of $4.1 billion at the end of 1989. The
insurance and financial services organization has subsidiaries that
operate in 50 states and Canada.
   Birmingham, Ala.-based Torchmark reported assets at Dec. 31 of
$4.9 billion and common shareholders' equity of $795 million.

   Speculation mounted Thursday that UAL Corp.'s
board of directors was close to accepting an employee buyout offer
that reportedly had been sweetened to more than $200 a share .
   The board met Thursday in Chicago, UAL's headquarters city, amid
reports that the three United Airlines union groups seeking to buy
the carrier's parent company had raised their bid from an estimated
$185 a share, or about $4 billion, to an offer valued at $200 to
$210, or at least $4.36 billion.
   The board is believed to be seeking at least $200 a share. The
directors have been negotiating with unions representing United's
pilots, machinists and flight attendants in the two weeks since it
rejected their $185-a-share offer.
   The board was still meeting late Thursday night, according to a
source close to the meeting. No other details were immediately
available.
   The board met at least twice by telephone earlier this week.
   A Wall Street takeover speculator and a source close to the
union group cautioned Thursday that an agreement by the board to
accept the employee offer would not necessarily mean a deal would
be concluded quickly or even concluded at all.
   The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that the union
group had sweetened its offer by adding a proposed sale of United's
50 percent stake in its Covia-Apollo computerized reservation
system, valued at $500 million or more.
   UAL's stock fell $1 a share to $165.50 Thursday on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   The takeover speculator, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said demand for UAL's stock has been blunted by concerns about the
difficulty the union group may face in financing the deal and about
the time it would take to complete a deal even if the board accepts
the union offer.
   ``You have to be very concerned with the time frame,'' he said.
   The union group, which represents about two-third's of UAL's
employees, proposed on March 19 the $185-a-share buyout, which
would give UAL's entire workforce 75 percent ownership of the
country's second-largest airline.
   The bid is supported by UAL's largest shareholder, Coniston
Partners, which holds an 11.8 percent stake. Unless the board sells
to the union group, Coniston says it will wage a proxy fight to
oust UAL's board at the company's April 26 shareholders meeting.
   The bid is reportedly opposed strongly by UAL Chairman Stephen
Wolf, who likely would be dumped if the workers gain control of the
company.

   Share prices soared on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
Friday morning, encouraged by the dollar's retreat against the yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose 899.11
points, or 3.2 percent, to close the morning session at 29,148.17.
   The dollar started trading at 156.90 yen, down 1.00 yen from
Thursday's close of 157.90 yen. The U.S. currency finished at
157.50 yen in New York overnight, down from 158.88 yen Wednesday.
   ``The market is almost dominated by buying orders,'' said Akiya
Shimoda, an equity analyst with Yamaichi Securities. ``The yen's
advance against the dollar is an encouraging factor.''
   ``Many investors, including institutional investors, began
considering that the index has reached its bottom level,'' Shimoda
said.
   The index closed 193.88 points lower on Thursday after having
been down more than 1,100 points at one stage amid rumors that some
small brokerages might fail.
   As of Thursday, the index had fallen 27 percent so far this year.
   Shimoda said the general mood in the market had turned brighter
after Thursday's afternoon session, when major institutional
investors began buying actively to support the falling market.
   In currency dealings, the dollar was responding to ``position
adjustments'' by participants prior to the weekend meeting of the
Group of Seven industrialized nations in Paris.
   Akihiko Kagawa, a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, said some
participants expect ``there will be some policy initiative to
defend the yen'' from the meeting of monetary authorities from the
United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and
Canada.
   Kagawa said there was ``no significant effect'' on the exchange
market from Thursday's agreement between the United States and
Japan pledging to reduce trade frictions by making broad-based
reforms in the economies of both countries.
   The agreement, reached after four days of discussions in the
Structural Impediments Initiative, set forth a set of proposals
aimed at lowering the United States' $49 billion deficit with Japan
by correcting structural barriers to trade.
   The yen's strength boosted Japanese government bond prices,
lowering interest rates. The yield on the benchmark No. 119
government bond fell to 7.21 percent from 7.24 Thursday.

   The House Energy and Commerce Committee
overwhelmingly approved a far-ranging air pollution control bill
late Thursday after resolving a dispute on how to deal with Midwest
concerns over acid rain controls.
   The measure now goes to the House floor where it is likely to
come up for debate early next month.
   The committee cleared the legislation by a vote of 42-1. Rep.
William E. Dannemeyer, R-Calif., was the sole dissenter.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., the committee chairman, called the
bill ``significantly better'' in protecting the environment than a
version approved by the Senate earlier in the week.
   The committee moved swiftly to approve the legislation after
giving the nod to a compromise agreement aimed at easing concerns
from Midwest congressmen over the high cost of acid rain controls.
   The acid rain compromise, worked out during three days of
closed-door negotiations among committee members and staff, was
approved by a 39-4 vote, erasing the last major roadblock to
committee passage of the bill.
   ``The process has been rather curious,'' said Dingell, alluding
to the lengthy private negotiations that eased the committee
through several obstacles.
   ``We have negotiated rather than fought ... and it has worked,''
he said.
   The lopsided committee vote following Senate approval of its own
clean air bill by an 89-11 margin earlier in the week put clean air
legislation on track for congressional approval this year.
   Both bills call for sweeping emission controls on factories,
automobiles and electric power plants by the end of the decade. The
Bush administration has estimated the Senate legislation would cost
$21.5 billion to the economy yearly when all provisions go into
effect. The House bill has been said to be slightly cheaper.
   House Speaker Tom Foley, D-Wash., had indicated that he wanted
to begin floor action on the legislation in early May. Final
legislation would have to be worked out in a conference committee
because of differences between the House and Senate bills.
   ``This legislation is long overdue. ... It's a real victory for
our lakes, lungs and resources,'' said Rep. Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn.
   The acid rain issue had dominated the three days of closed-door
bargaining among members of Dingell's committee as members and
staff worked under a deadline to try to complete action on the
entire bill before Congress departs for its Easter recess Friday.
   Earlier the committee had reached a consensus on provisions
dealing with curbing urban smog and controlling toxic industrial
releases.
   ``A lot of blood was spilled in these debates,'' said Rep. Jim
Cooper, D-Tenn., who vigorously opposed a cost sharing provision to
help the Midwest.
   But the compromise received Cooper's support as well as that of
all but four of the committee members, all from Texas: Reps. Ralph
Hall and John Bryan, both Democrats, and Jack Fields and Joe
Barton, both Republicans.
   As a way to help Midwest states pay for cleaning up dirty
utility plants, the measure included a ``pollution allowance''
system and a 1-year extension for initial compliance under some
circumstances.
   ``It allows us to recoup some costs,'' said Rep. Michael Oxley,
R-Ohio.
   Nevertheless, Oxley said, ``This is a tough, tough bill for my
part of the country and we're going to feel it for a long time.''
Critics of the measure have said it would cause electric rates to
jump.
   More than 150 lobbyists representing everything from
environmental groups to the steel industry gathered outside the
House hearing room were the negotiations were being held, awaiting
word of an agreement.
   The clean air legislation is aimed at imposing steep pollution
controls on a broad range of industry, automobiles and coal-fired
electric power plants to curb emissions of acid rain, smog and
toxic chemicals.
   Earlier in the day, the Environmental Protection Agency released
a new annual report that showed, as had previous reports, that
federal air pollution laws are failing to ensure healthy air in
more than 100 cities across the country.
   According to the EPA survey, which reported results on six
pollutants during 1988, more than 121 million people lived in areas
where the air did not meet federal health standards.
   The EPA assessment said the urban smog problem became 15 percent
worse in 1988 compared with the year before, in part because of an
exceedingly hot summer, and levels of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen
dioxide increased slightly.
   Levels of carbon dioxide and dust or dirt declined somewhat.
   The emissions are largely the product of automobile travel,
industrial releases or the burning of fossil fuels by electric
power plants.
   The report ``shows the magnitude of the air pollution problem
still remaining,'' said EPA Administrator William K. Reilly, adding
that it reinforces the need for new, tougher air pollution controls.
   The Senate's approval of a clean air bill Tuesday was the first
time either the House or Senate has passed tighter air pollution
legislation since 1977.
   Emotional regional disputes have blocked progress on a bill for
years, usually because of the high cost of reducing sulfur dioxide
emissions from power plants.
   While most members of Congress, as well as the Bush
administration, agree on a required 10 million ton reduction in
annual sulfur dioxide emissions to curb acid rain, the dispute has
focused on how much of a burden should be carried by the Midwest,
where some of the dirtiest plants are located.
