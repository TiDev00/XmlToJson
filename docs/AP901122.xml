   There's nothing fancy and not much
modern at Goolrick's Modern Pharmacy, where the druggist still
delivers prescriptions and the soda fountain waitresses call
everyone ``baby.''
   Much of the store looks as it did 50 years ago, say employees
and patrons.
   ``They got real wild in 1950 and changed the outside some. Why
change something if it works?'' asks former owner and druggist
Charlie Rector.
   The new owner is already looking to replace a new Pepsi machine
with something that looks older because the regulars don't like it.
   At $2.25, an egg salad and bacon sandwich is the most expensive
itemon the menu at the pharmacy's lunch counter. Behind the
counter, cigarettes are stacked in wooden racks alongside tins of
snuff and Goody's headache powder.
   ``We get lots of tourists in here who say, `Look, an
old-fashioned drug store, you don't see them like that anymore.' I
say, `Yeah, and you know why? Because you wouldn't patronize them,'
'' Rector said.
   The drugstore has been in business on the same downtown corner
for 121 years - through a fire, floods, desegregation and the rise
of chain drug and convenience stores that put many independent
pharmacies out of business.
   Rector bristles at the suggestion the store is an anachronism.
``This is not a curiosity. This is what a drugstore is supposed to
look like.''
   When Rector took over the business from his father and uncle in
1953, he had four competitors within a two-block radius. When he
retired and sold Goolrick's this fall, it was the only drugstore in
the business district in this city between Washington and Richmond.
   Like many American cities, Fredericksburg's merchant district
hit hard times in the 1960s and 1970s, but shopkeepers have been
able to capitalize on local Revolutionary and Civil war sites and
the city's proximity to Washington.
   Now antique and gift shops thrive in buildings that once housed
supermarkets and a five-and-dime. Tourists and antique buyers swarm
the brick sidewalks on sunny weekends and fill up the stools at
Goolrick's.
   A group composed mostly of elderly city natives gathers weekday
mornings, each with an unofficial spot at the counter or at one of
a half-dozen tables.
   ``It's not just a drugstore, it's a way of life,'' Rector said.
   The store was founded in 1869 and remained in the Goolrick
family until Rector's father bought the business in 1933, Rector
said.
   As a boy, Rector chipped ice, swept floors and delivered
Coca-Colas and Camels to downtown beauty shops on Saturday
mornings, he said.
   The drugstore has prepared prescriptions for generations of city
residents and still delivers drugs at any hour. A few people who
got their first Goolrick's prescription before World War I are
still customers, Rector said.
   New owner Stephen May has pledged not to make any major changes,
although he does plan to add a few tourist trinkets to the
inventory.
   ``I think everyone was worried I was going to rip the fountain
out, or worse yet, fire all the help,'' said May, 39, a pharmacist
who plans to keep the store until retirement.
   Regulars are touchy about even the smallest changes. ``They
don't like the new Pepsi machine I put in here, so I'm going to try
to replace it with something that looks older,'' May said.
   ``People like it just the way it is ... I guess if you came in
here as a child with your mother and now you've got kids of your
own you want them to see it like you did,'' said waitress Viola
Newton.

<DATELINE>VATTMAN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Folks in and around Vattman don't even
consider eating Thanksgiving dinner at home or going off to visit
relatives. For most of this century it's been a day when they all
sit down together.
   ``The people here in this community, this is their home for that
day,'' said the Rev. Sean Noone, Irish-born pastor of the small
Roman Catholic church that rises out of Vattman's plowed fields.
   Thanksgiving has been the high point of the year in the sparsely
populated farming area since 1913, when the annual feast began in a
grove of mesquite trees. It was canceled only in 1943, due to food
and fuel rationing in World War II.
   And 1943 is the only time that Idella Strubhart, 71, has ever
eaten Thanksgiving dinner at home. She grew up in Riviera, an
unincorporated town of 500 or so eight miles west of Vattman, in
southern Texas southwest of Corpus Christi.
   She said a daughter in San Antonio invited her for Thaksgiving
this year, ``And I told her I just couldn't do it. Everybody has a
job to do here.''
   Mrs. Strubhart was supposed to work in the kitchen while her
husband, Fritz, 78, helped run the bingo game. They met at the 1932
Thanksgiving dance.
   What began as a small gathering has evolved into a major
production at the parish hall of Our Lady of Consolation Church,
about the only structure that identifies Vattman as a community in
southern Kleberg County. The Handbook of Texas describes Vattman as
``more a community center for nearby farming families than a
town.''
   The all-day party merely begins with the dinner. Bingo, target
shooting, ring toss and other games keep the picnic going until the
dance starts at 8 p.m.
   This year the parish of about 60 families expects to feed 1,500
people at its Thanksgiving Day Picnic. Some former residents travel
hundreds of miles. Old friends and strangers also show up.
   Farm and residential development began in 1908 on land the King
Ranch sold after the railroad came through. Predominantly German
settlers came to farm the land. Now nearly all of the residents of
northern European descent seem to be related either by blood or
marriage.
   They and their Hispanic neighbors keep a slow, rural pace and a
sense of community hard to find in modern, urban America. Weddings
and high school football provide about the only source of public
entertainment the rest of the year.
   ``We grew up in sort of a naive setting here,'' said 62-year-old
native Teddy Marie Wallace, one of this year's picnic organizers.
   Residents donate much time and effort, she said, because they
know they have something worth preserving.
   ``I think we're kind of sinfully proud of our accomplishment,''
she said. ``I'm sorry, but we are. We do a good job.''
   The Thanksgiving dinner, priced at $7 for adults and $4 for
children, also is the church's only fund-raising event. The picnic
attracts members of other denominations as well as people who
otherwise never set foot in a church.
   This year's plans called for parishioners to cook 56 turkeys at
home and take them to the church on Thanksgiving Day.
   Others prepared vegetables and desserts. Loretta Yaklin, the
mashed potato maven, remembers how the now-defunct Vattman
parochial school she attended used to put the students to work
preparing the parish hall the week of Thanksgiving.
   The pastor said picnic organizers will meet about a week after
Thanksgiving and start planning for next year.
   ``If we ever quit it, there would be a lot of people lost,''
Mrs. Yaklin said. ``What would we do?''

<HEAD>Revted, n.a.-not avision Could Pinch Small Savers While Cutting Coverage
for Rich</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Treasury Department is considering a
deposit insurance change that could pinch small depositors even
though it is aimed mainly at reducing coverage for the rich.
   The department asked the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. for its
opinion on whether to restrict each American to three federally
insured bank, savings institution or credit00-per-account insurance limit.
   Some use brokers to divide their money among a number of
institutions. Others use a combination of single, joint and trust
accounts to protect more than $100,000. Under existing rules, a
couple with one child, for instance, can protect up to $1.2 million
at a single bank.
   Seidman said Treasury's idea ``has some merits and ought to be
looked at,'' but a trade group, the Independent Bankers'
Association of America, is vigorously fighting it.
   It argues that many Americans of modest means maintain more than
three accounts. For instance, a depositor with six accounts -
$1,000 in checking, $5,000 in savings, $2,000 in a credit union,
$10,000 in an IRA retirement fund and two $1,000 certificates of
deposit - would be allowed to designate only three of them as
insured, even though the total - $20,000 - is far below the
$100,000 limit.
   ``I think tens of millions of people would be adversely affected
and their financial life rendered more uncertain at just the wrong
time,'' said Kenneth Guenther, executive vice president of the
independent bankers' group, which represents smaller, community
banks.
   ``A lot of CDs (certificates of deposit) would wind up not being
insured,'' he said.
   However, Seidman said most small depositors likely would
consolidate their accounts so that all of their money was
guaranteed.
   ``This is much more likely to cut back on the guy who has quite
a bit more money,'' he said.
   A senior Treasury official, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said the definition of an account, for insurance
purposes, could be changed so that savers could combine all of
their certificates of deposit into one savings account with varying
maturities.
   The official stressed that limiting the number of accounts was
``one of a number of proposals floating around'' and ``we are not
in any sense embracing it.''
   However, Guenther's group, citing unidentified ``top policy
officials,'' said a limit on multiple accounts is ``the reform
concept most alive and well in Treasury circles.''
   The independent bankers have been lobbying against any cutback
in deposit insurance. They argue that large banks, which regulators
believe must be kept from failing to protect the financial system,
would have an advantage in attracting deposits over smaller
institutions whose failure would not threaten the system.
   But many economists have cited the broad coverage of deposit
insurance as one of the causes of the savings and loan debacle.
Shaky institutions have no trouble attracting deposits because the
accounts are federally guaranteed, they say.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said in July that the
administration was considering ways to limit depositors to $100,000
coverage, but a letter from Guenther to members of his group was
the first indication the administration is considering restrictions
that could affect depositors with much less than $100,000.
   In an effort to kill the proposal, the trade group on Wednesday
sent member banks 250,000 protest postcards, to be filled out by
customers and mailed to President Bush.
   ``We hope by Monday there will be 100,000 postcards at the White
House,'' Guenther said.

<HEAD>Reduced Earnings Cut Into Gulf Crisis Profits, Government Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Big oil companies nearly doubled their profits
from petroleum production after the Middle East crisis erupted, but
most gains were offset by lower earnings from refining, marketing
and the chemical business, a government report says.
   The major oil companies' net earnings rose only 1.7 percent in
the third quarter, despite soaring prices for crude oil and
petroleum products, the Energy Information Administration said
Wednesday.
   ``There's no statistical evidence that profiteering took
place,'' said Calvin A. Kent, administrator of the Energy
Department agency, although he said he could not rule out the
possibility of some isolated cases of profiteering.
   A study of third-quarter earnings reports from the oil companies
showed that the jump in oil prices after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
on Aug. 2 ``did not result in runaway profits for U.S. companies,''
Kent said at a news conference.
   Some consumer groups that closely follow energy issues greeted
the report with skepticism.
   Edwin Rothschild, an energy analyst for Public Citizen, accused
the Energy Department of protecting the oil companies and said
Congress should examine the companies' financial reports
independently.
   He accused the companies of using ``all sorts of (accounting)
schemes to under-report profits.'' And he contended that,
especially in the weeks immediately after the Mideast crisis began,
oil companies benefited significantly from inventory profits -
selling cheap oil bought before the crisis at the higher rates.
   The report said most of the oil companies did not separately
report inventory profit gains and losses in their July-September
quarterly reports and that the issue would be examined further when
annual reports become available early next year.
   The report provided no figures for specific companies, but it
said that generally, companies with their own production capability
fared much better than those that had to buy most of their oil.
   Although overall profits for the major oil companies were given
at only 1.7 percent, the companies fared much better in their
petroleum business. The major companies reported that earnings
directly from petroleum activities increased 24 percent during the
three months.
   But most of these gains were offset by a 50 percent decline in
earnings from chemical subsidiaries that had higher costs partly
because of soaring oil prices.
   Noting that 80 percent of the world's oil production comes from
foreign countries, the report said ``the vast majority of the
benefit of higher (oil) prices went to foreign interests, primarily
foreign governments.''
   But production profits increased sharply for the major U.S. oil
companies as well. Eight U.S. oil companies, which provided
production profits separately, reported earnings of nearly $1.5
billion from production during the three months, a 90 percent
increase over the same period in 1989.
   It was unclear from the report to what extent those profits were
offset by losses in refining and marketing at specific companies.
Refinery profits increased at five of the companies by as much as
46 percent, while at six other companies they declined by up to 83
percent, the report said.
   Meanwhile, U.S. independent oil and gas producers, a relatively
small segment of the industry, took advantage of the soaring world
oil prices and earned $102 million during the three-month period, a
685 percent increase over the previous year. These producers
reported earnings of only $13 million in the third quarter of 1989.
   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait led to a United Nations embargo of
Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil and a shortfall of world oil supplies by 4.3
million barrels a day, prompting prices to jump even though Saudi
Arabia and several other nations quickly announced they would step
up production.
   Spot crude oil prices, which were about $21 a barrel before the
invasion, peaked at $41 a barrel in October before declining. The
price closed at about $30 Wednesday.

   Here is the text of President Bush's Thanksgiving
radio message to American troops around the world:
   ``As we gather together for Thanksgiving this year, America has
much to be truly grateful for. To those of you who are spending
this holiday away from your loved ones to defend our nation's
security and that of our allies, I am deeply grateful. To those of
you on duty in the Persian Gulf, I say a special thank you.
   ``Recent events prove the world is still a dangerous and
unstable place. Along with the triumph of freedom around the world
comes new challenges - especially in the Middle East. Once again,
you, the men and women of our Armed Forces, have responded to the
call of duty to protect freedom and stand firm against aggression.
   ``And once again, you have the full support of the American
people and the thanks of this president.
   ``You know, Barbara and I have spent a lot of Thanksgivings with
a family we're proud of. Well, this year is no different, as we
spend Thanksgiving in the Persian Gulf. And as Americans celebrate
this special day back home, know that you are in their hearts.
America is proud of you and the job you're doing.
   ``Almost two years ago, I began my inaugural address with a
prayer, seeking God's wisdom and guidance in all that we face.
Earlier this month, with American troops facing down aggression
overseas, I asked the nation to join me in prayer - a prayer for
the brave servicemen and women in whom we entrust the future of
this country - as well as for those Americans held hostage. Now,
this Thanksgiving, I hope that all Americans of all faiths and
walks of life will bow their heads in appreciation for God's power
to protect us and his wisdom to guide us.
   ``As member of our armed forces worldwide, your strength and
readiness allow the flames of freedom and democracy to glow
brightly. You represent America's best - the world's best hope for
the future. No matter where you are, I hope you're safe and well.
The entire Bush family wishes you and your family a happy
Thanksgiving. May God bless you - and bring you home safely and
soon.''

<HEAD>Dangerous Toys Still Sold, Consumer Group Says</HEAD>

   Toys that could choke or strangle young
children still are on store shelves this Christmas shopping season,
a consumer group says.
   Releasing a list of allegedly hazardous toys that its members
found in stores throughout the country, the U.S. Public Interest
Research Group said safety standards are too lax and inadequately
enforced.
   ``As the biggest shopping day of the year approaches, parents
should not assume that the toys they find on the shelves are
safe,'' Lucinda Sikes, attorney for U.S. PIRG, said at a news
conference Wednesday.
   Because of inadequate or misleading labeling, toys containing
small parts that fit easily into a small child's mouth are still
available to children under 3 despite regulations designed to
protect that age group, the consumer group contended.
   The federal Consumer Product Safety Commission sets the labeling
standard, saying that toys with small parts should be labeled as
not intended for use by children under 3.
   But in a report, ``Trouble in Toyland,'' U.S. PIRG said the
labeling, even when accurately reflecting the intended age group,
misleads parents by ignoring the safety rationale. The labeling
often is in very small type as well, it said.
   ``Many parents may regard age labeling as a suggestion based on
the developmental maturity of a child, not realizing that the toys
labeled for use by children over 3 are often potentially lethal for
children who still tend to put things in their mouths,'' Sikes
said.
   As examples, the consumer group displayed parts that were either
loose, as in puzzles, or could easily be broken off or pulled off,
such as wheels or other pieces of toy cars.
   The report pointed to some crib gyms as particularly hazardous
and said balloons can be life-threatening as well. The group,
basing its report on 21 toys it said researchers had found on sale
in 14 states, said industry standards for such products are being
skirted or violated.
   David A. Miller, president of the New York-based Toy
Manufacturers of America, accused the consumer group of trying to
``frighten parents about toys that are perfectly safe.''
   He accused the group of trying to become ``national nannies''
and said it ignored the role of parental supervision and common
sense.
   Glenn Bozarth of Mattell Inc., said the group ``speculated''
that a piece could break off the ``Mickeytown Ice Cream Playset''
despite thorough testing by the company showing the toy doesn't
break.
   He said the consumer group should have approached Mattell about
the complaint instead of going directly to the media.
   Shari Metzler of Gund Inc. in Edison, N.J., said the group
included on the list a toy Siamese cat that the company quit
selling two years ago.
   Allan Shook of Trisar Inc., of Anaheim, Calif., said the group
used an old package of balloons sold by the company. He said the
company changed its warning label in July to reflect that children
as old as 5 face choking hazards from balloons and will include
even stricter labeling next year.
   Sikes acknowledged that the product safety commission was
working on special labeling requirements for balloons, balls and
marbles. But she said the rulemaking could take years.
   She said she was encouraged, however, by a new law that gives
the commission authority to fine manufacturers who keep putting
unsafe products on the market.
   CPSC spokesman Dan Rumelt said the agency had not had time to
review the consumer group's list. The agency held its own
presentation earlier this week, urging parents and shoppers to
watch for similar hazards.
   The commission said it received reports of 33 deaths related to
toys from January 1989 to September 1990. In 20 of these cases, the
children choked on small objects.
   The consumer group said toy-related injuries have increased
steadily, rising to 148,000 in 1989.

   Some of the American hostages who are
spending a quiet but somber Thanksgiving in the Iraqi capital say
it could be worse - they could be among the ``human shields'' held
at potential military targets.
   ``Although we have it better than those at the sites ... we all
suffer the indignity of being a hostage,'' said Roland Bergheer,
among a handful of American men who planned a turkey dinner today
at the U.S. Embassy residence.
   About 100 Americans are among the 600 Westerners held at
strategic Iraqi installations to deter a feared U.S. attack.
   ``Everyone at the residence feels this is the greatest holiday
of the year, the most meaningful, but it will be somber and
quiet,'' said Bergheer, 62, a construction company executive who
grew up in Los Angeles and makes his home in Las Vegas.
   Joe Wilson, the charge d'affaires at the American embassy, said
he hoped to begin Thanksgiving with the latest of several protests
to the Iraqi Foreign Ministry about the plight of Americans
prevented from leaving Iraq.
   It is an issue that Wilson has raised at least twice a week with
officials at all levels and with President Saddam Hussein during
their only meeting on Aug. 6, four days after Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait.
   He said special appeals have been made for hostages with medical
problems and individuals who should be evacuated for humanitarian
reasons. Wilson said 75 people fall into those categories.
   The Iraqis have mostly ignored the appeals, even for one man
whose wife died while he was being held at a strategic site.
   ``I tell you it is terribly frustrating,'' Wilson said. ``I
don't even know if my condolence letter to the gentleman has
reached him.''
   He said the Iraqi response has been that the hostages are
``guests'' who will be released when Iraq receives assurances it
will not be attacked.
   Diplomats are not allowed to visit hostages at strategic sites.
   The embassy tries to send the hostages their mail through the
Foreign Ministry. The diplomats have set up a pen pal system in
hopes of sending those hostages more regular mail. They publish a
weekly newsletter with football scores and news items designed not
to attract the attention of an Iraqi censor.
   ``We try to give them something that will remind them of home
and let them know we are thinking about them,'' Wilson said.
   Over the months of captivity, the hostages in Baghdad have
developed close relationships among themselves and with the
diplomats.
   ``They (the hostages) are really tough people,'' Wilson said.
``They're good people. They understand the issues and know how big
the issues are. ... They want to be able to walk out of here with
their heads high and not as a result of some underhanded
negotiations or payoff.''
   The American hostages in Iraq on Wednesday addressed a
Thanksgiving message to those celebrating the national holiday in
the United States. The message said in part:
   ``The ingredients of this deeply meaningful dinner are very
special, and are not available everywhere. The two main ingredients
are freedom and justice for all. Freedom to be your very best, to
exceed your own expectations, to worship and follow your own God,
and to come and go as you please. Justice to guarantee your rights
and freedoms under our constitution until proven wrong.''

   ``On this most traditional of American holidays, we would like

   ``This is a meal that only an American can fully appreciate.
Unfortunately, we are not free to enjoy the full flavor of our

<HEAD>Report: Stolen Secrets May Have Helped China Build Neutron Bomb</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Information that helped China develop a
neutron bomb was stolen from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
through espionage, according to a published report.
   A lab official who spoke on the condition of anonymity told the
San Jose Mercury News that espionage sometime before 1987 gave the
Chinese information they needed to explode a neutron bomb on Sept.
29, 1988.
   The official said the information leak was a result of ``total,
complete lack of management oversight.''
   Details of how the information was passed remain classified.
   George Carver, a former deputy director of the CIA, said
publicly last month that the Chinese success was based on U.S.
nuclear research, the newspaper reported Wednesday.
   ``In 1988 ... the Chinese blossomed forth with the neutron bomb,
which was made from data stolen from U.S. research centers,'' he
said in a speech to Lawrence Livermore employees.
   ``That's what a number of people think, including my friends in
the bureau (FBI),'' Carter said in a telephone interview from his
office at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in
Washington, D.C.
   Ed Appel, the head of counterintelligence in the FBI's San
Francisco office, confirmed the bureau has investigated possible
espionage at the lab. No arrests have been made.
   ``You could make the logical assumption that there have been
successful espionage attempts against the lab since its
inception,'' Appel said.
   The General Accounting Office reported in 1988 that foreign
intelligence agents posing as visiting scientists had gained access
to Lawrence Livermore and America's other two nuclear weapons
design laboratories.
   The GAO said dozens of Chinese had visited Lawrence Livermore
without a required background check and some were later found to
have links to Chinese intelligence services.
   The Chinese likely lacked information on how to build parts for
a neutron bomb, said John Lewis, a Chinese affairs expert at
Stanford University.
   ``It's not a very difficult theoretical technology, it's an
engineering problem,'' said Lewis, who has written a book on the
Chinese nuclear weapons program.
   A neutron bomb is a weapon designed to kill with lethal doses of
radiation without the widespread damage caused by other nuclear
weapons.

   Here is a list of 21 toys named by the private
U.S. Public Interest Research Group as posing dangers to children
under age three.
   The list is not intended to be comprehensive, the group says.
Rather, it represents the types of hazards that can be posed by
available toys.
   The list:
   1. Spring N' Bounce cars. Hazard: small parts, improperly
labeled. The group says the Chinese-made items were distributed by
YDC of York, Pa. The company did not immediately respond to a
request from The Associated Press for comment.
   2. Jeep Jr. 4x4. Hazard: detachable small part (reflector);
improper labeling. Messages were left at the office and answering
machine of Frank Keppler, spokesman for the San Francisco-based
manufacturer, Kransco.
   3. Scoot Along Miss. Hazard: small parts, improper age label.
Call not returned by official, Richard Nugent, vice president for
operations at Empire of Carolina Inc. of Tarboro.
   4. Wooden cars made by CE Ets R. Lorge of France. Hazard: small
parts; labeled for 3 years or older although toy would appeal to
much younger child.
   5. Nashco Train Puzzle. Hazard: small parts; properly labeled
though attractive to children under age 3.
   6. Nashco Airplane Puzzle. Hazard: same as above.
   7. Nashco Farm Puzzle. Hazard: same.
   The director of marketing and sales for Nashco Products Inc. of
Scranton, Pa., did not return calls. The puzzles are imported from
China.
   8. Mickeytown Ice Cream Playset. Hazard: small part (counter
top). Mattel Inc. spokesman Glenn Bozarth called the safety
complaint ``speculation.''
   ``They're speculating that if it were to break it would become a
small part,'' he said. ``We subject all our products to testing to
make sure it doesn't happen.''
   He complained that the consumer group made no effort to contact
the company directly with the safety concern.
   9. Siamese Stuffed Cat. Hazard: small part (bell); no age
labeling.
   Gund Inc. spokeswoman Shari Meltzer in Edison, N.J., said the
product was discontinued two years ago, was never designed for
small children, and had such a label the last year it was sold.
   10. Unique Party Favors - 4x4 Jeeps (a package of small,
brightly colored, wooden jeeps). Hazard: small parts, improperly
labeled. Ray Daikeler, executive vice president of the distributor,
Unique Industries of Philadelphia, was not in his office. The items
are made in China.
   11. Mini Mite Car Transport. Hazard: small parts; labeled for
over age 3 though attractive to younger children. Made in Hong
Kong. Paul Warschaw, the president of the distributor, Henry Gordy
International Inc. of Plainfield, N.J., was not in his office
Wednesday afternoon.
   12. Toy Cowboy Hat. Hazard: small part, no age labeling. U.S.
manufacturer could not be located. ``This toy cowboy hat has a cord
with a plastic closure ring,'' the report says. ``The ring is
easily pulled off the cord and is a small part.''
   13. Friction Powered Mini Blender and Mixer. Hazard: small
parts; labeled for age 3 but with appeal to younger children. Same
distributor as item No. 1.
   14. Little Angel Doll. Hazard: small parts; labeled for children
over 3 but with appeal to younger children. U.S. distributor of
Chinese-made doll could not be found.
   15. Toys'n Action Twirl'A'Way Plane. Hazard: small parts,
labeled for over age 3 though having appeal to younger children.
Supposed U.S. distributor could not be located.
   16. Baby's First Birthday Balloons. Hazard: lack of warning of
specific choking hazard from popped or uninflated balloons. Package
says ``not recommended for children under 3.'' Group says ``these
balloons are obviously intended for use by 1-year-olds.''
   Vice President and part-owner Allan Shook of the distributor,
Trisar Inc. of Anaheim, Calif., said the package that was displayed
is an old one that does not reflect changes made in July to reflect
that the balloons can pose a hazard for children up to age 5. He
said new labels next year will tell parents to supervise the use of
balloons with children up to age 6.
   Shook added that the balloons are distributed through party
stores and card shops and never were intended to be viewed as toys.
   17. Party Favors - Six Balloon Whistles. Hazard: choking; no
warning label. The switchboard was closed at the alleged
distributor.
   18. Snoopy plush toy in tuxedo. Hazard: detachable small part
(bow tie); no age labeling.
   19. Baby Exerciser. Hazard: violates voluntary industry
standards for labeling and strap length. Distributor Battat Inc. of
Montreal was reached and copy of allegations sent by facsimile, but
with no response.
   20. Sesame Street Crib &amp; Play Ten Toy with Peek-a-Boo Mirror.
Hazard: no warning label, long straps. Message left with secretary
at Illco Toy Co. of New York.
   21. Baby Trainer. Hazard: crib gym that has no age labeling and
no warning label to remove the toy when the baby playing with it
can get up on his hands and knees. Straps said to be too long. No
U.S. distributor listed for Dutch-made toy.

<HEAD>U.S. Says Visits To Hostages Extremely Risky, Relatives Disagree</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Gulf-Bush Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department contends it is
``extremely risky'' for Americans to visit hostage relatives in
Iraq, but a member of a family delegation in Baghdad insists he and
others were bring treated ``almost like royalty.''
   In issuing the warning Wednesday, department spokesman Richard
Boucher cited a close call Tuesday involving James Stevenson, an
American hostage in Iraq, two of his brothers and a sister.
   According to Boucher's account, when the two brothers went to
the Mansour Melia Hotel in Baghdad, security officials there tried
to move them to the 10th floor where the detainees are held.
   A U.S. consular official, who was at the hotel trying to find
Americans, intervened. She notified the embassy, which protested
the incident. The two Americans were released.
   ``Had the consular officer not been there, who knows what the
fate of this family might have been,'' Boucher said. ``It's
incidents like these that force us to remind Americans that travel
to Iraq is extremely risky.
   ``For those who have decided to travel, we request that they
inform the State Department of their plans so we can alert our
embassy in Baghdad and offer assistance as needed and as
possible.''
   But Stevenson's sister, Mary Trundy, reported that the group has
not experienced any danger.
   ``They are being treated almost like royalty,'' said her husband
Dennis, who spoke to Mrs. Trundy on Wednesday afternoon from
Brockton, Mass.
   Boston television station WHDH quoted Mrs. Trundy as saying:
``We were not detained. They have treated us like a guest.''
   Trundy said his wife made no mention of Tuesday's incident and
he had nothing on the conditions of her brother's confinement. She
planned to have Thanksgiving dinner with her brother today, he
said.
   Trundy acknowledged he was concerned about the visit because of
uncertainty as to what the Iraqis might do.
   ``I left the decision up to her. I didn't want to sway her one
way or the other. I knew she was going,'' he said.
   Boucher said four families have visited relatives in Iraq and
four others have indicated an intention to visit.

<HEAD>Judge Sets Emergency Hearing on Democrats' Gulf Suit</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Gulf-Bush Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge plans a Dec. 4 hearing on a
lawsuit by 45 House Democrats seeking to bar President Bush from
ordering an attack on Iraq without congressional approval.
   U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene on Wednesday gave the
government until Monday to file its response to the lawsuit. The
judge said he would hear arguments Dec. 4 on the lawmakers' motion
for a preliminary injunction in the case.
   The lawmakers, led by Rep. Ronald V. Dellums, D-Calif., contend
in the lawsuit filed Tuesday that under the Constitution's war
powers clause Congress must debate and vote on a declaration of war
before American troops can be used to dislodge Iraqi forces from
Kuwait.
   ``We're talking about a really serious situation - an emergency
hearing on Dec. 4 to really determine whether the president can use
the offensive option,'' said Michael Ratner, an attorney for the
Center for Constitutional Rights, which represents the lawmakers.
   Greene, a liberal Democrat appointed by President Carter,
rejected the Justice Department's motion to transfer the case to
U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth, a former government attorney
appointed by Reagan. Lamberth is considering a separate challenge
to the president's war-making powers by Sgt. Michael R. Ange.
   Ange, a recently activated Army National Guard reservist, is
seeking a court order that he be returned to this country.
   Ange lost a bid for a temporary restraining order to bar his
deployment to the Middle East. But Lamberth scheduled a Dec. 10
hearing on his motion for a permanent injunction, saying the case
``poses a difficult legal question.''
   In rejecting the Justice Department's transfer motion, Greene
said ``the only two factors which the two actions have in common
are some of the Department of Justice's apparent defenses, and the
fact that there is an overlap among counsel.''
   The New York City-based Center for Constitutional Rights
represents both Ange and the lawmakers. The same section of the
Justice Department's civil division is handling both cases.

   Moments before he was sentenced to 10 years in
prison, convicted Wall Street financier Michael Milken sat in his
chair crying.
   When U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood pronounced the sentence
Wednesday, Milken stood quietly. It was the stiffest penalty
delivered in cases arising from Wall Street insider-trading
scandals.
   Milken's distress was evident from the moment he walked into the
standing-room-only courtroom with his wife, Lori, on his arm.
   He seemed tense as he alternately fidgeted in his seat at the
defense table or sat with his hands clenched in his lap.
   About 10 minutes into the hearing, Milken started sobbing as his
lawyer, Arthur Liman, read a letter from a woman who wrote of
Milken's help for her brain-damaged daughter.
   ``This is a man whose concerns about his friends or people in
trouble always came first,'' Liman said.
   Milken's outburst lasted a few minutes, although he appeared to
cry or be close to tears at several other points of Liman's nearly
hour-long presentation.
   Mrs. Milken sat in the front row with family members and friends
and blinked back tears as Liman described Milken as an
``extraordinary husband and father.''
   Milken spoke briefly.
   ``I did not only violate the law but all of my values and
principles. I deeply regret it and will for the rest of my life.
I'm truly sorry,'' he said before slumping back in his seat.
   After the judge left the bench, Mrs. Milken rushed to her
husband's side and hugged him. She then grabbed him by the arm and
led him from the courtroom through a rear door.

   WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) - Three Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles took
a gnarly spill during filming of their sequel, and the dude playing
hero-on-the-half-shell Donatello broke his ankle.
   Stuntman-actor Steven Ho required surgery and a cast after the
accident Wednesday. He and two other players were hurt when a net
holding them in the air gave way.
   ``A steel cable holding the net snapped and the turtles fell six
feet onto the sand-covered stage at Carolco Film Studios,'' said
Michael Casey, publicist for ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The
Secret of the Ooze.''
   Nick Palma, who plays Michaelangelo, and Larry Lam, who plays
Leonardo, were treated for minor injuries and released. The fourth
Ninja Turtle, Raphael, was not in the scene.

   SARATOGA, Wyo. (AP) - Christopher Reeve didn't remember the name
of this tiny Wyoming town after a brief summer visit, but locals
remember him.
   Reeve, star of the ``Superman'' films, has been invited to reign
as Kingfish at the annual Ice Fishing Derby in January.
   Reeve visited Saratoga during a solo cross-country flight this
past summer. He talked about the town during a television
interview, but couldn't remember its name.
   ``For this reason, we are happy to have named him Kingfish of
our 1991 Ice Fishing Derby to thank him for the kind words and also
to remind him of our name, Saratoga,'' said derby chairman Shawn
McBride.
   As Kingfish, Reeve would pass out awards, and ``generally just
get honored,'' said Carol Sherrod of the local chamber of commerce.
   If Reeve doesn't accept, he'll be in good company, she said.
Britain's Prince Charles and his wife, Diana, and late night talk
show host Johnny Carson have declined the same invitation in past
years.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Soul-funk singer Rick James suffered bumps
and bruises when he tumbled from the stage during a benefit concert
at a Hollywood nightclub, officials said.
   James, best known for the 1981 hit ``Super Freak,'' fell Tuesday
night while singing M.C. Hammer's ``You Can't Touch This,'' said
Joe D'Ambrosio, a spokesman for the China Club.
   James was performing atop a floor speaker next to the stage when
he tried to step back to the stage and lost his footing, D'Ambrosio
said Wednesday.
   He was treated and released at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
``He's got a sore back and sore neck, but thank God he's fine,''
D'Ambrosio said.

   BURBANK, Calif. (AP) - The husband and wife team of Neal Marlens

an exclusive four-year deal.
   The couple will handle a wide variety of projects, Disney
announced Tuesday.
   The agreement's financial terms weren't released. Reports
earlier this fall estimated that Disney would pay them at least $15
million.
   The couple also co-produced the movie ``Soul Man'' for New World
Entertainment, and wrote and produced the TV show ``Growing

   Friends of Michael Milken viewed the
convicted financier's 10-year prison sentence for securities and
tax fraud as unduly harsh compared to penalties imposed on other
Wall street miscreants.
   They said they had hoped the former Drexel Burnham Lambert
executive would be required only to perform community service.
   Now they are hoping that after Milken cooperates with
investigators, as he has indicated he will do, his sentence will be
reduced.
   ``It's like they hit me over the head with a sledgehammer. What
a waste talent,'' said Richard Riordan, a prominent lawyer and
philanthropist who has been an ally of Milken in many business and
charitable activities.
   Riordan noted that U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood, who sentenced
Milken in Manhattan, said she would consider reducing his
punishment if he cooperates with investigators.
   ``And Mike will cooperate,'' Riordan said. ``He'll tell the
truth.''
   Riordan said he and Milken spent much of Sunday discussing
charitable projects on which they have worked around the country,
many for inner city children.
   Melba F. Coleman, a beneficiary of one of those projects, said
she, too, was devastated by the news of the 10-year sentence.
Milken had seemed hopeful earlier in the week that he might get
only community service, she said.
   ``I am just devastated. I talked with him on Monday. His spirits
were up,'' said Mrs. Coleman, the principal of the 102nd Street
School in Watts.
   Milken had set up a math club for children at the school, showed
up to tutor them himself, once brought along pop star Michael
Jackson, and gave the children T-shirts, calculators and circus
tickets.
   That personal involvement in the heavily minority area had won
him the loyalty of Mrs. Coleman and others, who wore ``I Love
Michael Milken'' buttons.
   ``I was optimistic he would get community service,'' Mrs.
Coleman said. ``And he was optimistic too - he told me, `I hope to
see you in a few weeks.'''
   In arguing that Milken's sentence was too severe, Riordan
pointed to Ivan Boesky, the speculator in takeover stocks whose
confessions to insider trading led investigators to Milken in 1986.
   Boesky, who served two years of a three-year term, committed
more serious crimes, but ``Mike was king of the mountain, and they
used Boesky to get Mike,'' Riordan said.
   He said that while Milken broke laws, his actions ``were not
evil,'' whereas ``(Boesky) took inside information, he bribed
people and he used it to make money.''
   Milken's charitable contributions, particularly to minorities,
are well known and were the topic of a host of pro-Milken letters
written to Wood before he was sentenced.
   Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Richard A. Adler, for example,
wrote an unsolicited letter to Wood on Milken's behalf. Adler,
whose son received math lessons from Milken, noted the philanthropy
began years before Milken was in trouble with the law.

<HEAD>Pentagon Said To Postpone Discharges, Retirements and Transfers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army has decided to halt retirements and
discharges, as well as transfers unrelated to the Persian Gulf
crisis, according to news reports.
   The Washington Post said in today's editions that the Army had
decided to use the authority to hold personnel in the service,
which was granted by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney under a
little-noticed presidential order issued in August.
   Normally, 5 percent to 7 percent of the 760,000 soldiers in the
Army would leave each month.
   The Post said details of the plans were being worked out, and
that some exemptions would be given for hardship cases, such as
family illness. The plan could keep in place most of the Army
personnel who may be seeking to return to the United States from
overseas bases or move from one base to another, the paper said.
   The Post quoted unnamed officials as interpreting the decision
as move to keep officers and enlisted personnel with specific
skills in place, implying that it might not be applied
across-the-board.
   The New York Times quoted officials as saying the Army has
decided to use the authority to halt about 1,500 retirements and
discharges a month, but that no decision had been made by the Navy,
Air Force or Marine Corps.
   The Times quoted Navy officials as saying they were considering
using the authority to retain dentists, doctors and medical
technicians.
   The initial report on the Pentagon decision came from CBS News.
   Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Stuart Wagner said he had no
information on the subject.
   Meanwhile, the Army announced Wednesday that National Guard
combat brigades from Georgia, Louisiana and Mississippi will be put
on active duty in about a week for possible deployment to the
Persian Gulf.
   They will be augmented by National Guard combat units from
Alabama, South Carolina and Texas to create a combined fighting
force of about 15,100 soldiers, the Army said.
   Separately, the Air Force said it was sending an unspecified
number of OA-10 low-level observation aircraft to the Arabian
Peninsula for Operation Desert Shield, and the Navy ordered to
active duty 875 reservists from 13 states and the District of
Columbia.
   The Air Force OA-10 planes, which are used to direct air and
ground fire at enemy armored vehicles, are deploying Saturday from
Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Ariz.
   More than 77,000 reservists from all military services already
have been called up for Desert Shield. It is the largest reserve
activation since the 1961 Berlin crisis.
   Included in the Army statement was the first official mention
that two active divisions - the 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized)
of Fort Carson, Colo., and the 5th Infantry Division (Mechanized)
of Fort Polk., La. - may be sent to the gulf as further
reinforcements beyond the deployments already announced.
   The Guard brigade from Mississippi will be assigned to the 4th
Infantry Division and the unit from Louisiana will be made part of
the 5th Infantry Division, bringing both of those heavy units to
full three-brigade strength, the Army said.
   The Army said the divisions, with their National Guard brigades,
could be used as additions to the force now in Saudi Arabia or as
rotation forces to replace units that have been there since early
in the crisis sparked by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.

   Moscow plans to pull 200,000 troops

same.
   ``It's time to reduce the remnants of the Cold War in the

President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   His comments to Korean businessmen came on the heels of this
week's summit in Paris, where officials formally declared the Cold
War over in Europe.
   Medvedev, a member of the Soviet president's council of
advisers, proposed that leaders in Asia meet for military
consultations to speed up talks on arms control, the scaleback of
forces and reduce tensions.
   ``We are firmly convinced that it is impossible to realize
progress in the Pacific region without the essential removal of
military confrontation,'' he said. ``Building on nuclear missiles
has been continuing as before and naval exercises have not been
reduced.''
   Medvedev said that by 1992 Soviet soldiers stationed in Mongolia
will be pulled out and the Soviet presence in Cam Ranh Bay,
Vietnam, substantially reduced. He said the Soviet naval fleet in
the Pacific will be ``drastically reduced.
   ``It is important for the Soviet Union and the United States to
be recognized as partners by ceasing to be military adversaries in
the region,'' he said. ``Despite positive developments, there have
been virtually no changes in the military field.''
   Medvedev said the Soviet Union supports a North Korean proposal
for the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea and backs
the north's demands that the divided peninsula be made into a
nuclear-free zone.
   About 43,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea to help
deter communist aggression. North Korea has demanded the troops be
withdrawn and nuclear weapons it claims are stored in South Korea
be removed.
   A planned December visit to Moscow by South Korean President Roh
Tae-woo is seen as a milestone in Soviet-Korean relations that may
lead to reduced tensions in Korea, Medvedev said.
   The two nations established full diplomatic relations in
September.
   Medvedev said Moscow wants to establish relations ``of a new
quality'' with Japan and expects Gorbachev's visit to Tokyo next
spring to be a turning point.

<HEAD>American U. Board Rethinking $1 Million Buyout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American University's Board of Trustees plans
to hold a special meeting Dec. 6 to rethink its reported offer of a
$1 million severance package to former President Richard Berendzen
that has caused a campus furor.
   The board scheduled the meeting this week in response to
protests over the proposed payout to Berendzen, who resigned last
spring while under police investigation for making obscene
telephone calls from his office.
   The trustees authorized the settlement at a closed meeting three
weeks ago, on the condition that Berendzen relinquish his remaining
affiliation as a tenured physics professor, The Washington Post
reported today.
   Earlier this week, the university's acting president, Milton
Greenberg, urged the board to discuss the settlement with campus
groups and reconsider it in order to allay ``serious rifts''
between the trustees and the rest of the school.
   ``During my entire career, including more than 20 years as a
senior academic administrator, never have I seen another
campus-based issue evoke this degree of anguish,'' Greenberg wrote.
``Never have I seen so many speak with a single voice.''
   Students, faculty members and deans have complained that the
board voted to approve the settlement, which is not final, without
consulting anyone on campus.
   They are particularly concerned that the trustees acted on a
tenure question, which traditionally is the responsibility of a
university's faculty.
   Some also contend the package is too expensive for a university
with a relatively small endowment and high costs for students.
   Berendzen's status at AU has been ambiguous since his
resignation last April. Technically, he holds a job as a physics
professor, but he has not worked on campus and has not followed the
necessary steps to get a sabbatical or a leave.
   Berendzen pleaded guilty in May to two charges of making obscene
phone calls. He received two 30-day prison sentences, which were
suspended on condition that he remain in outpatient psychiatric
treatment.
   Berendzen's attorney, Richard Marks, said neither he nor his
client would comment.

<HEAD>Blind Man Gives Thanks After Making 2,167-Mile Appalachian Trail
Hike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILLINOCKET, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blind hiker Bill Irwin said today will
be the best Thanksgiving he's ever had after becoming the first
sightless man to walk the entire 2,167-mile Appalachian Trail.
   ``It's just an indescribable feeling of gratitude,'' Irwin said.
``I feel like I did the best I could at the time, and hopefully the
Lord feels the same way.''
   On Wednesday, a crowd of about 70 people fell silent as Irwin
reached out and touched a sign marking the campground where he
completed the eight-month trek.
   After the 50-year-old hiker prayed silently, the crowd broke
into cheers, said David McCasland, a free-lance writer who traveled
with Irwin during the final two weeks of the hike.
   Dozens of friends, reporters and other hikers who joined Irwin
for the final 2.4-mile leg Wednesday backed away and let him walk
the last tenth of a mile alone.
   Eighteen fellow members of the People's Memorial Christian
Church in Irwin's hometown who were on hand to see their friend
finish his trek sang ``Amazing Grace'' as he approached the sign
marking the end of the epic hike.
   Irwin was given a commemorative sculpture and his guide dog
Orient received a new harness and a leash.
   Irwin, who set out from the southern end of the trail at
Springer Mountain, Ga., during September floods, arrived late
Wednesday morning on a snow-covered trail at the remote Katahdin
Stream campground.
   Along the way, the broad-shouldered Irwin's worst injury was a
broken rib sustained when he slipped on a stone and his 50-pound
pack swung over his head, slamming him onto a rock.
   In Maine, Irwin was swept off his feet while crossing the West
Branch of the Piscataquis River and was carried nearly 20 yards
down the icy stream, McCasland said.
   He also was delayed for three days in Maine by a snowstorm that
left 28 inches on the ground. The sun shone brightly Wednesday.
   A recovering alcoholic, Irwin lost his sight nearly two years
ago to a disease that destroys the retina.
   The Burlington, N.C., resident decided nearly a year ago to
attempt the feat as an affirmation of his faith in God. Sponsors
have helped pay his expenses. Irwin was with only his dog for much
of the time.
   He couldn't see the magnificent vistas or trailside sunsets
during his trek, but Irwin said the sounds and smells of the
wilderness provided more than enough beauty.

   Rebel army troops tried to
seize power Thursday in the nominally independent black homeland of
Transkei and clashed with loyalist forces, according to South
African reports.
   Military ruler Maj. Gen. Bantu Holomisa issued a statement
saying he was still in control and the coup had failed. He said the
coup was headed by several whites and involved a tiny group of
dissident soldiers.
   Holomisa identified the coup leader as a white army captain,
Craig Duli, who had been a senior official in the government. He
said the coup involved six whites and a handful of black troops.
   Holomisa and the army seized power in Transkei in 1987 and set
up a government that had close ties with the African National
Congress, the main black opposition group in South Africa.
   In recent days, he had charged that the South African government
or other elements were plotting a coup against his government.
   South African diplomats in the homeland capital of Umtata said
fighting broke out in the city around dawn Thursday when the rebels
attempted to seize key government buildings. Shots had been heard
and roadblocks erected, but the diplomats had no details on how
serious the fighting was.
   ``Early this morning, there were shots that were heard in parts
of Umtata,'' said South African diplomat Gert Terblanche, reached
by telephone in Umtata.
   The independent South African Press Association said ``a large
number'' of soldiers had reportedly been wounded in the fighting.
   It appeared fighting broke out at an army base on the outskirts
of Umtata and the rebels later attempted to seize government
buildings in the city, the news agency said.
   Transkei, with about 2.75 million people, consists of three
discontiguous areas in the southeast of South Africa.
   It is one of four nominally independent black homelands set up
by the South African government in the 1970s and 1980s as part of a
plan to create separate states for blacks under the apartheid
system of racial separation.
   No country other than South Africa recognizes the independent
homelands, most of which have been pressing for reintegration into
South Africa.

<HEAD>Junk Bond `King' Gets 10-Year Prison Term, Maybe Less if He Sings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Junk bond ``king'' Michael Milken, credited with
fueling Wall Street's corporate takeover boom of the 1980s, now
personifies America's change in fortunes with his 10-year sentence
for securities fraud.
   It was the toughest penalty imposed in cases arising from the
the Wall Street scandals that followed the boom.
   The sentence U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood levied Wednesday
could be reduced if Milken cooperates fully with prosecutors, but
the stiff term undercut criticism from Milken supporters who
claimed his crimes were merely technical violations.
   Milken had pleaded guilty to six federal felony counts and
previously paid $600 million in fines and restitution.
   Milken, 44, stood expressionless as the judge read the sentence.
His wife, Lori, was among about 200 spectators crowding the court.
   Lawyers, scholars and law enforcement officials agreed the term
was longer than expected and concluded that Wood wanted to send a
strong message that financial crime doesn't pay.
   ``The sentence is entirely justified in light of the severity of
the crimes Milken committed, and the risks he created for the
broader U.S. financial market,'' Securities and Exchange Commission
Chairman Richard Breeden said.
   The lengthy sentence also provides a measure of vindication for
the government, which had been criticized for its zealous
prosecution of Milken.
   They were accused of hitting Milken with an excessive 98-count
indictment that included charges against his brother, Lowell, in an
effort to extract a guilty plea.
   ``It's an indication from an impartial source that the
government was right in bringing this case and prosecuting it as
hard as it did, and in bringing him to justice,'' said Bruce Baird,
who was head of securities fraud in the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's
Office during the early stages of the Milken prosecution.
   ``It's stiffer than I would have guessed but every day of it
richly deserved,'' he said.
   Milken is the former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. financier whose
pioneering use of high-yield junk bonds raised billions of dollars
in capital, much of it used to finance the hostile corporate
takeovers that characterized an era.
   He faced a maximum 28 years in prison. He already has agreed to
pay $200 million in fines and place $400 million in a fund to
compensate investors.
   Milken was ordered to report to federal custody on March 4,
1991. He will be eligible for parole after serving at least
one-third of his term, meaning he could not be released until 1994.
A prison was not designated.
   Milken also must perform 1,800 hours of community service during
each of three years' probation. That equals nearly 35 hours a week.
   Wood said she would consider reducing the prison term if the
government made such a request based on Milken's future
cooperation, which is required under the plea agreement.
   The government has said it is continuing its investigation into
lawbreaking on Wall Street, including transactions involving Milken
and Drexel.
   Linked to scandal by former speculator Ivan Boesky in late 1986,
Milken had steadfastly denied any wrongdoing and pledged to fight
his March 1989 indictment.
   He changed his mind in April after months of negotiations. At
sentencing, Wood indicated that his initial refusal to cooperate
worked against him.
   ``Milken rode to the top in success in financial wealth and now
he's hit the bottom,'' said attorney Arthur Mathews, whose client
Paul Bilzerian received a four-year term, until Wednesday the
longest such penalty in the Wall Street trading scandals.
   Defense attorney Arthur Liman asked the judge for community
service only, saying Milken's crimes were ``deviations from an
otherwise admirable life.''
   Liman cited Milken's $360 million in charitable contributions
beginning before the federal investigation, and other endeavors.
   ``I'm not a psychologist. I can't offer your honor an
explanation as to how Michael slipped,'' Liman said. ``I can just
attest to those values that come out constantly.''
   But Wood said Milken's crimes were not merely technical
violations brought on by Milken's overzealous desire to help
clients, as the defense maintained. She said Milken obstructed the
government's investigation and balked at early efforts to win his
cooperation.
   Milken pleaded guilty to conspiracy, securities and mail fraud,
violating federal securities reporting requirements, filing false
information with regulators and aiding the filing of a false tax
return.

<HEAD>Energy Department Lax In Overseeing Nuclear Weapons Security,
Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional investigators say the Energy
Department failed to take prompt action after inspections showed
some guards at nuclear weapons facilities could not shoot straight
and did not know how to handcuff intruders.
   The General Accounting Office, an investigating arm of Congress,
said Wednesday that some shortcomings uncovered in 1985 inspections
at the department's Los Alamos, Argonne, Sandia and Savannah River
sites went uncorrected for five years.
   The GAO report was requested by the House energy subcommittee on
oversight and investigation and by Sens. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., and
Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., after a 10-week strike by the contract
security force at the Los Alamos National Laboratory last year.
   The congressional investigators said many guards hired as
replacements during the strike did not have the required skills.
   They also said an unannounced exercise conducted in April showed
that 75 percent of the regular security force failed at one or more
of the skills required.
   ``For example, when the participants encountered an adversarial
situation, many failed to stay behind cover and assess the
situation,'' the report said. ``Instead, they left their cover and
walked up to the potential adversaries to ask what they were
doing.''
   Consequently, it said, many of the adversaries were able to take
out a visible weapon, theoretically kill the guard and make off
with classified documents.
   It said 24 participants and hostages were ``killed'' during the
test.
   The Energy Department referred inquiries about the report to Los
Alamos, where Anna Bachicha, a public affairs officer, said the
``report was just released today and we just received a copy of it
this afternoon and have not had time to fully assess it.''

<HEAD>Study Says Deposit Law Would Help Environment</HEAD>

   A new government report says imposing a
deposit on beverage cans and bottles would reduce pollution and
conserve energy.
   The study released Wednesday by the General Accounting Office,
the congressional investigative agency, improves prospects for
passing deposit legislation next year, said Rep. Paul Henry,
R-Mich.
   ``It addresses all of the industry concerns,'' said Henry, who
this year unsuccessfully sponsored a bill to charge a five-cent
refundable deposit on soft-drink, beer and mineral water
containers. Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., pushed similar legislation.
   ``There is no correlation between a bottle bill and a dropoff in
beverage consumption,'' Henry said. ``There is no direct tie
between loss of container manufacturing jobs and a bottle bill.''
   William L. Ball III, president of the National Soft Drink
Association, said a national deposit law ``would be an unwanted
albatross around the neck of those who are serious about recycling
and the environment.''

<HEAD>Nearly Quarter Million Texans, New Mexicans Live In Colonias</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly a quarter million people in Texas and
New Mexico live in impoverished communities along the border that
lack sewer systems or adequate water supplies, congressional
investigators say.
   A General Accounting Office study of six Texas counties along
the Rio Grande found 198,000 people are living in 842 colonias -
unincorporated, rural subdivisions with frequently substandard
housing, inadequate roads, a lack of running water or adequate
sewage systems.
   Sixty percent of the colonias surveyed have water supplies but
less than 1 percent - or a total of three - have a public sewage
disposal system, said GAO, the investigative arm of Congress.
   ``I'm very concerned that the lack of proper waste systems for
these colonias poses a growing health risk to residents and their
children. It's also contributing to environmental problems along
the border,'' said Rep. Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, who requested
the study.
   De la Garza, chairman of the House Agriculture Committee,
released the study Wednesday and said it ``substantiates the need
to continue and strengthen our efforts to bring adequate water and
sewer facilities to the hundreds of thousands of colonia residents
along the Texas-Mexico border.''

<HEAD>Medflies Found In California After Infestation Declared Over</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UPLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Medflies were found in California just
two weeks after the state said it had wiped out an infestation that
lasted nearly 16 months and cost $52 million to fight, agriculture
officials announced.
   ``This is a revolting development,'' E. Leon Spaugy, Los Angeles
County agricultural commissioner, said Wednesday. ``I had hoped we
could get through winter without finding any.''
   Spaugy said the latest outbreak could have been caused by
residents bringing illegal fruit from outside the country.
   The unmated female Mediterranean fruit flies were trapped in
residential neighborhoods in Upland and nearby Rancho Cucamonga on
Nov. 15.
   Fly trapping will intensify around the sites where the two were
found, said Don Schreiber, San Bernardino County deputy
agricultural commissioner.
   Two weeks ago, officials declared victory in a nearly 16-month,
$52 million battle against the crop-destroying pest.
   ``There's no question in my mind now that they never eradicated
them from this area,'' said Richard Rice, a University of
California, Davis entomologist. ``We had better stay pretty light
on our feet.''
   Rice said it took a week for authorities to identify the flies
as wild and that delay is unacceptable because the Medfly
reproduces so quickly.
   ``That's a serious flaw in their strategy right there,'' he
said. ``It's just unforgivable. You can't give Medflies that window
of opportunity.''

   The dollar fell against the yen Thursday, while
share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rebounded.
   The yen closed at 127.13 yen, down 0.55 yen from Wednesday's
finish of 127.68 yen. After opening at 126.93 yen, the currency
ranged between 126.70 yen and 127.14 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 583.29
points, or 2.56 percent, closing at 23,400.28. The index shed
388.49 points Wednesday.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds rose to 85.94, up from Wednesday's close
of 85.56. Their yield fell to 7.500 percent from 7.585 percent.
   Many economists expect the U.S. Federal Reserve Board will move
to lower interest rates further soon. Lower interest rates tend to
make a nation's currency less attractive to investors.
   Yuichi Sugiura, a dealer at Sanwa Bank, said the dollar was also
weakened by easing tensions in the Middle East.
   Though market players still feel uncertain about the Persian
Gulf crisis, ``they lean more to the view there will be a peaceful
settlement,'' Sugiura said.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index started higher on
small-lot buying in a favorable reaction to the yen's appreciation
against the dollar as well as higher bond prices, securities
dealers said.
   ``Share prices are rising in a broad front,'' said a dealer at
Nikko Securities Co. who spoke on condition of anonymity.

   J. Seward Johnson, whose statues are so
lifelike a security guard once shot one, envisions a down-to-earth
rendering of Abraham Lincoln for the town where the 16th president
delivered his most famous speech.
   Johnson's Lincoln will be near the town square, but on the
sidewalk instead of a pedestal - and aside a likeness of a 20th
century tourist. The tourist, dressed in slacks and a cable-knit
sweater, holds a copy of the Gettysburg Address as he listens to
the president.
   The artist, who lives near Princeton, N.J., has been
commissioned to create the statue for this rural Pennsylvania town
where Lincoln delivered the famed Civil War speech 127 years ago.
   Johnson, perched on an antique chair in the office of Civil War
scholar Gabor Boritt, said the statute is designed ``to celebrate
Lincoln's humanity, bring him off a pedestal, celebrate the
greatness of him as a human being.''
   Another purpose is ``to show that the Gettysburg Address was
still a meaningful document today.''
   The 268-word address, whose opening, ``Four score and seven
years ago,'' is familiar to millions, is regarded by scholars as
one of the most forceful and elegant speeches ever made.
   Lincoln delivered the address at a dedication of the national
military cemetery in Gettysburg on Nov. 19, 1863.
   In Johnson's artwork, Lincoln is saying something to the tourist
as he points to the nearby Wills House, where he stayed the night
before the speech.
   ``He might have been saying how uncomfortable the bed was,''
Johnson said with a laugh as he flexed his long, thick fingers.
``Whatever it is, the fellow is a little bit in awe of him.''
   Johnson hopes to have the artwork completed in time for next
November's annual Gettysburg celebration.
   A model has been on display around town for several weeks, and
the reception has been positive, Johnson said. He resisted
suggestions that he replace the tourist's sweater with a jacket,
but agreed to some minor changes.
   ``On something like this, I feel an artist has to be very
sensitive to the people who have to live with it,'' he said.
   He was commissioned for the work by the Lincoln Fellowship of
Pennsylvania, which sponsors the annual ceremony marking the
speech. The group has sought a statue honoring Lincoln for nearly
50 years.
   ``The hope has been here for a long, long time and finally we
are doing it,'' said Boritt, a professor of history at Gettysburg
College. He said the Lincoln Fellowship is trying to raise $100,000
to pay for the statue and provide a maintenance fund.
   ``We are willing to accept a dollar and we will accept
$10,000,'' Boritt said.
   The figures will be cast in bronze, but they will wear real
clothes coated with a plastic-like resin.
   Johnson's lifelike sculptures are displayed in 26 states, the
District of Columbia and several foreign countries.
   He tells countless tales of drivers who try to pick up an
umbrella-toting statue in the classic cab-hailing pose or of people
who try to strike up conversations with figures on a park bench.
   But one of his favorite stories involves the statue that was
shot by a security guard answering a silent alarm at a house in Los
Angeles. No intruder was found.
   ``It frightened the guard so much that he shot the sculpture,''
Johnson said. ``The more you can fool them, the better it is.''

   Five-year-old Nicolette Folsom sat in the
grass by the graves of her parents and baby sister in the hillside
cemetery near her home and showed off an awards certificate she won
at school.
   She spoke quietly, holding the certificate skyward.
   ``I brought this home and we put it on the refrigerator. But I
wanted you to see it,'' she said. ``I'm doing real good in school
and I'm happy in school.''
   June Kenney, Nicolette's grandmother and legal guardian,
recounted the scene Wednesday. Thanksgiving, the first holiday
since AIDS and suicide claimed all but one member of the Folsom
family, will be difficult, she said.
   Nicolette's mother, 29-year-old Jennifer, and her 3-year-old
sister, Angela, died of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome
earlier this fall.
   Her father, Doug, fatally shot himself in June after watching
his family struggle for two years with the killer virus.
   Jennifer said this summer she believed she contracted the
disease through a blood transfusion during an emergency
appendectomy in a Massachusetts hospital in 1979, before blood
supplies were tested for the AIDS virus.
   Angie, she said, contracted the virus during the pregnancy or
later from breast feeding. Nicolette has routinely tested negative
for the virus. She will be tested again in five years, Mrs. Kenney
said.
   ``Her concept is they all have gone to some other place ... that
Doug is fishing, her mother is knitting, and Angie is playing,''
she said. ``That's her concept of heaven. She thinks they'll all be
together.
   Nicolette sees an art therapist weekly to help her cope with the
loss.
   ``We try to tell her that everybody doesn't die young,'' her
grandmother said.
   Mrs. Kenney said Nicolette has ``little worry people and little
worry stones'' that she talks to at night. ``She talks to her
mother ... once in a while she does get emotional,'' she said.
   ``Everybody is still trying to get through it. It's not over
yet, for sure,'' said Fred Kenney, Jennifer's brother.
   ``Each person handles it differently. For some of us, it's been
a tough time because we haven't had time to mourn yet. Now we have
time to sit back and reflect,'' he said.
   For June and Don Kenney, the tragedy has been extra difficult.
They have once again assumed the role of parents to a young child.
   Mrs. Kenney has also begun speaking to community organizations
and support groups for the families of AIDS victims. She also is
using notes kept by Jennifer over the course of her illness to
write a childrens' book on coping with the death of a parent from
AIDS.
   The family is also sending out about 600 cards of thanks to
people across the country who sent messages of support, as well as
gifts and money, after Jennifer spoke publicly of her family's
struggle.
   Jennifer said at that time that she wanted people to know that
AIDS is not only a big-city problem. ``Vermont does have AIDS. The
children of this generation need to be taught now because we don't
know if there is going to be a cure,'' she said.
   ``One of the things we're thankful for is the fact that she
didn't die fruitlessly,'' Mrs. Kenney said Wednesday. ``But we all
have our moments, each and every one of us. There are times when
the sky is blue and sunny, and we think of things we used to do
with Jenny, and she's not there.''

<HEAD>Study Questions Finding that Rival Heart Attack Drugs are Equal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The surprise finding earlier this year that a $76
heart attack drug is just as good as one costing 29 times more has
been called into question by new research released today.
   The latest report bolsters the widespread skepticism among U.S.
physicians that greeted the release of a major Italian study
finding that the two clot-dissolving medicines are equally
effective.
   Both drugs are intended to break up clots that plug that hearts'
arteries during heart attacks. If these clots are removed within
four hours or so, victims may escape permanent damage to their
hearts.
   The chief rivals for this lucrative market are TPA, which costs
$2,200 per treatment, and streptokinase, which costs $76. Early
U.S. studies suggested that TPA worked better, and the medicine
quickly gained about two-thirds of the U.S. market share.
   ``The real issue around the world is whether streptokinase is
comparable to TPA,'' said Dr. Judith Hsia, principal author of the
latest report. ``It's much cheaper, and many countries, including
the United States, would prefer to give it if it is just as good.''
   Some thought that issue was settled last March when an Italian
study of 12,490 men found that the two drugs ``appear equally
effective and safe for use in routine conditions of care.'' It
found that about 23 percent of patients died or suffered serious
heart damage, no matter which medicine they received.
   However, that study made little use of a blood thinner called
heparin, which is routinely given with TPA by U.S. doctors. The new
study shows that heparin is essential for TPA to work properly.
   The latest study, called the Heparin-Aspirin Reperfusion Trial,
or HART, was directd by Dr. Allan M. Ross of George Washington
University and published in today's New England Journal of
Medicine.
   ``If you use TPA in a fashion that doesn't allow those opened
arteries to stay open, then the gain will presumably be lost.
That's the implication of HART,'' said Ross.
   Dr. Lawrence Cohen of Yale University agreed that the latest
work casts doubt on the Italian team's conclusion.
   ``I think there is a distinct possibility that the survival rate
might have been better in the TPA group had adjuvant therapy
(heparin) been given in an optimal fashion,'' Cohen said.
   A new study called GUSTO - for global utilization of
streptokinase and TPA - recently began on 33,000 people to settle
whether TPA and heparin together save more lives than
streptokinase.
   Answers to these questions are important financially as well as
medically, since the market for clot-dissolving drugs is huge. An
estimated 1.5 million Americans suffer heart attacks each year.
   TPA is a genetically engineered human protein that is made by
Genentech. Streptokinase, produced from bacteria, is made by
Hoechst AG of Germany. A new entrant in the field is the
genetically engineered Eminase, which is made by SmithKline Beecham
and costs $1,700.
   TPA acts quickly in the blood stream to break up clots, but the
medicine almost immediately disappears when it is withdrawn.
Streptokinase works more slowly but continues to linger in the body
for hours after the treatment.
   In the latest study, researchers randomly assigned 205 heart
attack victims to receive TPA either with or without heparin.
Eighteen hours later, the once-clogged arteries were flowing freely
in 82 percent of those who got heparin and in 52 percent of those
who did not. This suggests that without heparin, new clots
frequently formed again in their arteries.

<HEAD>Atlantis Back in Hangar, Little Damage Found</HEAD>

   Space shuttle Atlantis sustained
hardly any damage during a secret Pentagon mission that began with
an unusual nighttime launch and ended with a rare Florida
touchdown.
   ``It's probably one of the cleanest birds I've ever seen come
back after a mission,'' James Harrington, NASA's director of
shuttle operations, said Wednesday.
   Atlantis and its five astronauts landed Tuesday at Kennedy Space
Center after five days in space. The shuttle was diverted to
Florida because of bad weather at the main touchdown site in
California.
   As of Wednesday afternoon, Atlantis' brakes had not been removed
for inspection but were thought to be in good shape, Harrington
said. The only wheel damage was scuffed rims.
   During the Pentagon mission, which had to be extended a day
because of bad weather for landing at Edwards Air Force Base,
Calif., the crew deployed a spy satellite. Sources said the
satellite will eavesdrop on Iraqi communications in the Persian
Gulf.
   It was the sixth shuttle landing at Kennedy and the first in
five years. Discovery, the last spaceship to land in Florida, blew
a tire and sustained brake damage in 1985.
   Only three of the 28,000 heat-resistant tiles covering the
shuttle will need to be replaced, Harrington said. The three tiles
have ``good-sized nicks,'' he said.
   Usually the shuttle's tail surface is peppered with dirt kicked
up from the natural runways at Edwards, Harrington said.
   ``We had a good, clean mission, a good, clean landing and very
little tile damage overall,'' Harrington said.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration will save
about $1 million and a week in processing time because Atlantis
landed at Kennedy and thus avoided a cross-country trip. Atlantis'
next scheduled flight is in April.
   The Florida landing was especially gratifying for Kennedy
workers, who had been frustrated for months by hydrogen leaks that
grounded Atlantis and Columbia.
   ``You could light up a Christmas tree with all the smiles on the
troops around here,'' Harrington said.
   Next up is Columbia, which is expected to lift off around Dec. 2
with an astronomical observatory. NASA officials are expected to
set a launch date after a review Tuesday.
   The mission has been on hold since hydrogen leaks grounded the
shuttle in May.

   An ancient statue fragment on display at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art was stolen and smuggled out of Turkey,
according to published reports.
   The other half is in a museum at Antalya, near Perga, Turkey,
where the statue was excavated in pieces in 1980, according to a
New York Times report today based on an article in the December
edition of the magazine Connoisseur.
   The marble piece is thought to be the top half of a statue of
the mythical hero Hercules.
   The Turkish government has hired the New York law firm of
Herrick, Feinstein to investigate allegations it was stolen, the
Times said.
   Cornelius C. Vermeule III, curator of classical art at the
Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, told the Times the work was one of
many copies of a bronze original identified with the sculptor
Lysippos of Sicyon, and likely made around 330 B.C.
   It was bought from a western European dealer ``with all the
proper papers and credentials,'' Vermeule said.
   He said relicas of the Lysippos sculpture were ``in every
shrine, bath, gymnasium from Gaul to Mesopotamia.''
   The fragment is owned jointly by the Boston museum and
collectors Leon Levy and Shelby White.

   In another signal that the Cold War is over, the
remains of Polish pianist, composer and statesman Ignace Jan
Paderewski are to be returned to his homeland nearly 50 years after
his death.
   The remains will be honored with a state burial in Poland, The
New York Times reported today.
   Paderewski, who died in 1941 at age 80, declared in his will
that although his heart was to remain permanently in the United
States, his body should be returned to his native Poland - but not
until the nation was free and independent.
   The transfer of his remains has been authorized by the Polish
government and is expected to be approved by the U.S. government,
according to the report. Paderewski, a world-renowned pianist, held
the posts of prime minister and minister of foreign affairs in a
post-World War I coalition Polish government.
   At the time of his death, when Poland was occupied by Nazi
Germany and the Soviet Union, Paderewski was president of the
Polish Parliament in Exile.
   When he died, President Franklin D. Roosevelt authorized the
placement of his remains in a crypt on the battleship Maine
memorial at the Arlington National Cemetery ``until such time as
Poland is again free.''
   His heart was placed in a crypt in the Cypress Hills Cemetery in
Brooklyn. In 1986, it was moved by the Paderewski Memorial
Committee to a bronze crypt in the National Shrine of Our Lady of
Czestochowa, in Doylestown, Pa.

<HEAD>Growth Boom Brings Big-City Problems to Once-Quiet California Town</HEAD>
<HEAD>By NOEL K. WILSON</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRESNO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Californians seeking cheap housing have
helped turn this once-quiet far town into one of the nation's
fastest-growing cities, but growth has brought big-city problems
like crime, drugs and crowded schools.
   ``Fresno, unfortunately, is growing up,'' said nurse Tom
Stoeckel at Valley Medical Center, which has treated
cocaine-addicted babies in its obstetrics ward and where one or two
gunshot victims routinely arrive each day.
   ``Fresno is developing a Los-Angeles type situation - we now
have drive-by shootings,'' Stoeckel said.
   The city of more than 350,000 also has crowded schools, street
gangs and an inversion layer that makes it one of the worst smog
basins in the nation. But city officials say the growth didn't
catch them by surprise and, with an abundance of open land
remaining, they don't expect it to ebb anytime soon.
   ``We were forecasting this kind of growth in 1981 and 1982,''
said Al Solis, the city's development director.
   In 1980, Fresno had 218,202 residents. Preliminary 1990 census
figures increased the total to 350,794 - a 61 percent growth rate
that boosted Fresno from the nation's 65th-largest city to 47th. It
also made Fresno the fastest-growing of the nation's 50 largest
cities.
   Officials say growth was spurred by cheap housing, an aggressive
annexation program that vastly expanded the central California
city's borders and an influx of Asian immigrants.
   An average Fresno home costs about $100,000, compared to
$250,000 in San Francisco to the north or Los Angeles to the south.
   Among those who flocked to the area in search of cheap housing
were thousands of Southeast Asian refugees, mostly Hmong. In 1979,
officials say, there were about 30 Hmong in Fresno, compared to
about 48,000 today.
   As the growth boom took place, Fresno rapidly expanded its
borders, annexing 21,951 acres of adjacent county land, a move that
brought 38,000 former county residents into the city.
   Highlighting the problems was a Labor Day rampage in which one
person was killed and eight wounded. Police say four teen-agers
associated with one of about 20 active street gangs went on a
four-hour shooting and robbery spree, attacking people at random.
   Growth has also caused crowding in some schools, and school
officials have switched many campuses to year-round programs to
accomodate added students.
   Solis said environmental problems, including water shortages,
could eventually slow Fresno's population boom.
   Several wells drilled in north Fresno produced water polluted by
years of agricultural pesticide use, he said.
   Officials say the city's location in central California's San
Joaquin Valley, with its natural inversion layer, also gives it the
potential for serious smog problems.
   But despite the problems, Solis predicted growth will continue
for several years to come.
   ``We don't have the limitations that other cities in California
have,'' he said. ``As long as the demand is there, and the supply,
we'll grow.''

   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rebounded
sharply in relatively thin trading today, while the dollar fell
against the yen for the fourth consecutive day.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which had lost
388.49 points Wednesday, gained 583.29 points, or 2.56 percent,
closing at 23,400.28.
   A total of 360 million shares were traded on the first section,
up from 260 million shares Wednesday.
   Japan's markets will be closed Friday, the nation's Labor
Thangsgiving holiday.
   Securities dealers said the index was pushed up by brisk
index-linked buying and arbitrage buying, in which investors seek
to profit from price gaps between the spot and futures markets.
   The declining trend of Japanese interest rates was encouraging
investors, they said.
   ``Long-term interest rates already have shown a downward trend
and short-term ones seem likely to follow suit,'' said an analyst
with Nomura Securities Co., speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Higher interest rates tend to support a currency but discourage
stock investment.
   The dollar closed at 127.13 yen, down 0.55 yen from Wednesday's
finish of 127.68 yen. It opened at 126.93 yen and ranged between
126.70 yen and 127.14 yen.
   The dollar has fallen 2.60 yen in four days.
   Some $9.95 billion changed hands in today's spot trading, down
from $15.28 billion Wednesday.
   Shigeto Yanase, a dealer with Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, said
expectations of further declines in U.S. interest rates helped push
the dollar lower.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds rose to 86.11 as of 4 p.m. (2 a.m. EST)
from the previous day's 85.56-point finish. Their yield fell to
7.464 percent from 7.585 percent.

   Two earthquakes about an hour apart
rattled the Anchorage area shortly after another quake hit the
Aleutian Island area more than 1,000 miles away. There were no
reports of injuries or damage.
   The first of the Anchorage quakes, measuring 3.4 on the Richter
scale, struck at 9:16 p.m. local time. It was centered about 20
miles north of the city, said scientists at the National Earthquake
Information Center at Golden, Colo.
   The second quake, measuring 4.1, hit at 10:19 p.m. and was
centered about 40 miles southwest of Anchorage, authorities said.
   A magnitude 5.3 quake struck the tip of the Aleutian Islands,
about 1,100 miles to the southwest, at 8:14 p.m. Anchorage time,
officials said. The quake was felt by people at the Adak Naval
Station about 50 miles away.
   A 5.6-magnitude temblor also struck the central Aleutians
Tuesday afternoon.
   Seismologists said they didn't know if any of the quakes were
related.
   Quakes measuring above 5 on the Richter scale are capable of
causing significant damage if they hit heavily populated areas.
   The 1964 Alaska quake that killed more than 100 people measured
8.4 on the Richter scale, while the San Francisco quake of 1906 was
estimated to register 8.3. The October 1989 quake that hit Northern
California measured 7.1.

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It looks like a deep-sea Thanksgiving is in
store for a humpback whale after it spent the past few days
exploring New Jersey's polluted waterways.
   The 30-foot to 35-foot-long whale, which was spotted in the
Hackensack River and Newark Bay, was escorted through New York
Harbor Wednesday and out into the open ocean by New Jersey State
Police boats, with the help of a marine mammal expert.
   The same whale has been spotted in rivers around New Jersey
before, said Bob Schoelkopf, director of the Marine Mammal
Stranding Center, which is based in Brigantine, N.J.
   ``We immediately recognized it as a humpback whale that was
originally spotted in New Jersey two years ago,'' Schoelkopf said.
He said it appeared in the Delaware River two years ago and last
year in both the Shark River and the Raritan River.
   ``So it does know its way around and for some reason prefers to
come in and then head out again,'' Schoelkopf said. He said he
recognized the animal by a distinctive notch in its dorsal fin.
   Humpback whales are common in the Atlantic Ocean off the
northeastern United States, he said.
   Workers at a Public Service Electric &amp; Gas Co. plant were the
first to see the whale on its latest visit, as it swam past the
generating station late Tuesday afternoon.
   The whale was swimming up river ``as though it wanted to look
and see what was going on, and when the tide switched it switched
direction,'' Schoelkopf said.
   ``We essentially herded it by staying behind it and on either
side so it would only go in one direction,'' Schoelkopf said,
adding that the whale might come back.
   ``This may not be the end of the story. He may end up taking a
turn and going somewhere else,'' he said. ``It's hard to predict
these animals.''

<HEAD>Lyme Disease May Cause Lasting Nerve Damage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Years after the tick bite that triggers Lyme
disease, people with lingering infections may suffer memory loss,
shooting pains and other signs of nerve damage, the doctor who
discovered the disease reported today.
   Antibiotics usually relieve the lingering symptoms, although
recovery is seldom complete.
   ``This is similar to syphilis,'' said Dr. Allen C. Steere.
``Although the neurological symptoms and consequences are
different, in both diseases there are long periods of latent
infection in the brain followed by a variety of neurological
disorders.''
   Lyme disease is a bacterial infection transmitted by tiny ticks
that are usually carried by deer and mice. It is common throughout
the Northeast, Midwest and California.
   Usually the first sign of Lyme disease is a red circular rash
around the tick bite. It is often accompanied by fever, fatigue,
aches and other flu-like miseries. In more advanced stages, the
disease can cause arthritis as well as the neurological problems.
   Steere, who first recognized the disease in Old Lyme, Conn.
about 15 years ago, was senior author of the latest report, written
with two colleagues at New England Medical Center in Boston. It was
published in today's New England Journal of Medicine.
   The doctors studied 27 patients with chronic neurological
symptoms that typically began a year or two after the start of
their infections.
   All but three of them had signs of mild brain disease, or
encephalopathy. These included memory problems, such as forgetting
names, missing appointments and misplacing objects. Others felt
very sleepy during the day or were troubled by extreme
irritability, growing angry over what would ordinarily be minor
annoyances.
   Some also showed subtle language difficulties and trouble
finding words. Most were able to keep working, but three quit their
jobs, three cut back their hours and two retired early.
   The other major category of disorder was polyneuropathy, a
disorder of the nerves outside the brain. People often had back
aches with shooting pains, tingling sensations and lack of feeling
in their hands and feet.
   The researchers found that a two-week course of antibiotic
injections significantly improved the way the patients felt. But
six months later, more than one-third had either relapsed or were
no better.
   The doctors speculated that the treatment failed because it did
not wipe out the bacteria completely or because the patients'
nervous systems were irreversibly damaged.

<TEXT>
   A private agency founded by a general who led
a CIA-backed anti-communist army in Laos during the Vietnam War has
been extorting money from Laotian refugees to keep up the
resistance, a state agency charges.
   State social services officials say Lao Family Community coerced
contributions from ethnic Hmong refugees on behalf of the United
Lao National Liberation Front, also known as the Neo Hom.
   Lao Family Community funnels government aid to many of the
approximately 100,000 Hmong who live in California, and also
provides English classes, job training programs and counseling to
Hmong residents.
   Some people who refused to pay were threatened with violence and
some refugee families who refused to deal with the Lao Family
Community lost thousands of dollars in welfare benefits, said
Alicia Martinez, director of the state Department of Social
Services' Civil Rights Bureau.
   Martinez said her own life has been threatened since her agency
began its investigation 18 months ago.
   The two groups were founded by former Lao Army Gen. Vang Pao, a
Hmong who led a CIA-backed insurgency after the communist Pathet
Lao gained control of the country.
   Vang Pao and other officials from the Neo Hom and Lao Family
deny any wrongdoing.
   ``Yes, there are some people working in Lao Family who have been
donating money for the front, but I think that is within their
right,'' said Lao Family Director Gayle Morrison.
   The Civil Rights Bureau has recommended that public agencies
suspend Lao Family's contracts, worth about $5 million in fiscal
1989.
   As a result of the Civil Rights Bureau report, the six counties
that deal with Lao Family have suspended contracts pending a
review, Martinez said.
   The state attorney general's office is also investigating the
groups, but no criminal charges have been filed, said Deputy
Attorney General James Dutton.
   The Neo Hom, with 9,000 to 10,000 members in the United States,
is the largest of several Lao resistance groups. From its Santa Ana
headquarters, about 30 miles southeast of Los Angeles, it has
legally solicited money for years to finance a guerrilla war
against Laos' communist government.
   A reclusive hill people from northern Laos, many Hmongs had
little contact with the outside world before joining a
U.S.-supported campaign against communist insurgents in the early
1970s. When Laos' pro-U.S. government fell, thousands of Hmongs
fled to the United States.
   About a dozen families told investigators Lao Family officials
threatened that they would not receive benefits unless they
contributed to the Neo Hom, Martinez said.
   Figures on how much money was allegedly extorted were not
immediately available, but victims were reportedly ordered to make
initial contributions of up to $100 each and then pay monthly
amounts of as much as $5.
   Officials learned of the alleged extorition from two people who
refused to deal with Lao Family.
   Song Moua, spokesman for the National Liberation Front, said the
group has not tried to extort money. All donations go to resistance
fighters and refugees still in Asia, he said.
   Martinez said she believed many Hmong gave in to the alleged
extortion demands because they became used to corruption in their
homeland.
   ``I think a lot of people took it as part of the system,'' she
said. ``They experienced it there and they were experiencing it
here.''

such dedicated support.' ''

   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) - Secretary of State James A. Baker III
arrived in Yemen today to seek its support for a United Nations
resolution authorizing military force to drive Iraq out of Kuwait.
   Baker has traveled the globe in recent weeks on an intense
lobbying effort to obtain the approval of the 15 U.N. Security
Council nations for such a resolution.
   The United States holds the rotating presidency of the council
until the end of this month and had initially wanted to propose the
resolution before it ceded the chair to Yemen in December.
   ``If this is going to happen,'' Baker said Wednesday, ``that is
a process that must begin at some time. This is the 22nd of
November, and November has 30 days.''
   Baker was to present the U.S. case to the country's president,
Gen. Ali Abdullah Saleh, and Foreign Minister Abdul-Karim
al-Iryani. Yemen's government has publicly sided with Iraq in the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   The secretary of state, who had accompanied President Bush to
Saudi Arabia, split off from the president's Thanksgiving visit to
military forces in the Saudi desert. He is the first high-ranking
U.S. official to visit to the Red Sea state since Bush stopped here
in 1986 as vice president.
   Bush met Wednesday in Jiddah with the exiled emir of Kuwait,
Jabber al-Ahmed al-Sabah. The president said afterward that fresh
steps should be taken this month in the United Nations to free
Kuwait.
   Yemen, located on the southwest corner of the Arabian peninsula,
is the only Arab nation on the Security Council. It has in the past
shown some sympathy toward Iraq and has criticized the military
buildup of U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein sent his foreign minister, Tariq
Aziz, to Yemen on Tuesday to deliver a message on the gulf
situation, according to the official Yemeni news agency.
   Officials said Baker would return to Jiddah tonight and might
meet Friday with Malaysian officials. Malaysia, located on the
southeastern tip of Asia, also is a member of the Security Council.
   Since last weekend, Baker has met with the foreign ministers of
eight nations on the council. Next weekend, he pays a visit to
Colombia where he will confer with President Cesar Gaviria.
   Baker said Wednesday the United States and the Soviet Union had
``unanimity of opinion with regard to the problems in the gulf.''
Baker held lengthy meetings with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze in Paris this week during the 34-nation summit of the
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
   Shevardnadze had said in Paris that the Security Council should
``take stock of things'' and, if need be, adopt new resolutions.
However, neither he nor Gorbachev endorsed the idea of a resolution
to authorize use of force.
   The Security Council has approved 10 resolutions against Iraq
since its Aug. 2 invasion of its oil-rich neighbor. They impose an
economic boycott on Iraq and occupied Kuwait, call for Iraq's
unconditional withdrawal and insist upon restoration of Kuwait's
previous government.
   Yemen has abstained from voting on half of those, according to a
State Department count.
   None of the resolutions authorizes military action, but they
leave the door open to other measures if Iraq fails to respond to
the steps.

<HEAD>An Iron Lady Who Transformed Britain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>With PM-Britain-Thatcher
^By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Margaret Thatcher has been every bit the Iron Lady
- durable, rigid, formidable in battle.
   Since taking power in 1979 as Britain's first woman prime
minister, Mrs. Thatcher has often been unpopular, often a minority
- in Britain's alliances, and even in her own Cabinet - and never
in doubt.
   But on Thursday she announced her resignation amid a strong
leadership challenge from her former defense minister, Michael
Heseltine.
   Only Winston Churchill rivaled Mrs. Thatcher's commanding
profile in 20th century Britain, and no one approached her record
of three straight general election victories.
   In 1980, when others shirked from the radical free-market cures
of Thatcherism, Mrs. Thatcher scolded her fellow Conservatives:
``You turn if you want to; the lady's not for turning.''
   She dismantled Britain's version of socialism, crushed
obstructive labor unions, led a military victory against Argentina
in the Falkland Islands and preached military readiness to the
Western alliance.
   Asked what she had changed in her country, her answer was
simple: ``Everything.''
   ``We have raised Britain in the respect of the world from what
it was - broke, bankrupt, unwilling to defend itself properly,''
she said in 1987. ``We have, I think, transformed Britain.''
   In the 1980s then-President Ronald Reagan was her friend and
ideological soulmate, but she was one of the first Western leaders
to recognize Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev as ``someone we
can do business with.''
   Even before she became prime minister, the Soviet press had
tagged her as ``the Iron Lady,'' a title she wore proudly.
   A political outsider, Mrs. Thatcher was proud of imposing the
values she had learned from her father, a small-town grocer, on a
political establishment grounded in wealth and privilege.
   She led the Conservative Party to election victories without
ever winning the affection of most of her people. Throughout her
career, she was fortunate in her opponents.
   She was elected party leader on May 4, 1975, ousting Edward
Heath after he had lost two national elections in a row.
   In 1979, her election was insured by popular disgust with high
inflation and labor unrest under the Labor Party government.
   When her own popularity ebbed in 1982, Argentina invaded the
Falklands. The surge of national pride that followed the reconquest
carried her triumphantly through the 1983 election.
   She was also helped by the split in the Labor Party, which
produced a new party of the center, so that the Conservatives won
elections without winning majorities of the popular vote.
   After the collapse of the Iron Curtain, when her gospel of
military preparedness began to appear passe, Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. Once again, she was the best
friend of an American president, backing up tough talk with ships,
tanks and troops.
   The political left loathed her and had good reason to fear her.
Liberals accused her of exacerbating divisions between rich and
poor and of undermining free speech.
   Peter Jenkins, a leading liberal columnist, said after a decade
of Thatcherism that she had overthrown ``the existing order,
changed the political map and put her country on its feet again.''
   ``She did all this with ruthlessness and much injustice and at a
high cost in human misery, but she did it,'' commented Jenkins.
   For the majority who had jobs, she raised living standards
dramatically - average earnings were up by nearly one-third and
more Britons owned their homes.
   Thatcherism was all about free markets and private enterprise.
She sold much of the industry the Labor government had
nationalized, turning such money-losers as steel and British
Airways into profitable enterprises.
   Her success deeply affected the Labor Party, which moved sharply
to the center in hope of regaining power.
   To her admirers, battling Maggie was a national savior who ended
Britain's postwar cycle of confrontation and decline. To her
detractors, she was an anti-union bull set free in a china shop,
destroying revered institutions.
   In 1981, after she began implementing her rigorous policies and
unemployment soared to a record 3 million, Mrs. Thatcher was rated
the most unpopular prime minister since opinion polls began.
   Even when she had become a sort of national institution, polls
regularly indicated two-thirds of Britons disliked her personally.
Similar majorities also said they respected her, and courage was
one of the qualities they admired.
   She survived unscathed from an Irish Republican Army bomb that
killed five people at the 1984 party convention in Brighton.
   ``You have to cope with it,'' she said ``Because if you didn't
and they intimidated you out of doing the work you have been
elected to do, it would be the end of democracy.''
   In foreign policy, Britain under Mrs. Thatcher was unequivocally
pro-American.
   In 1986, she was alone among the allies in associating herself
with the U.S. bombing of Libya, allowing the bombers to fly from
British bases.
   When the Iron Curtain crumbled in 1989 and a united Germany
emerged as Europe's new superpower, Mrs. Thatcher appeared
sidelined.
   But she reemerged as the leader most willing to rush to
America's side with troops in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Mrs. Thatcher fought mighty battles with fellow European
Community leaders, resisting attempts to turn the community into a
sort of United States of Europe.
   Born Oct. 13, 1925, Margaret Hilda Roberts learned her values of
thrift, discipline and industry from her father, a grocer in the
small town of Grantham in central England.
   She became involved in politics at Oxford University, where she
won a chemistry degree in 1947.
   Her electoral career began in the traditional way, slogging
through hopeless campaigns in 1950 and 1951 in districts where the
Conservatives had no hope.
   She married wealth businessman Denis Thatcher in 1951, and their
twins, Carol and Mark, came two years later.
   Mrs. Thatcher was elected to Parliament in 1958 for Finchley, a
middle-class north London district. She was minister of pensions
and national insurance from 1961-63 under prime ministers Harold
Macmillan and Lord Home. Edward Heath made her education secretary
in his Cabinet of 1970-74.
   Against formidable odds, including her social origins and her
sex, she won a contest for the party leadership in 1975. W
   hile more prominent Conservatives held back from a challenge,
Mrs. Thatcher plunged in, winning so many votes in the first round
that Heath resigned.
   The 1975 party election was the start of what biographer Hugo
Young, called ``an era in which an ordinary politician, laboring
under many disadvantages, grew into an international figure who did
some extraordinary things to her country.''

<DATELINE>IN EASTERN SAUDI ARABIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. troops greeted
commander-in-chief George Bush on Thanksgiving Day with an
overriding message: Let's do something now or go home.
   Because of security precautions, Bush's whirlwind seven-hour
visit to U.S. and allied forces in eastern Saudi Arabia was so
shrouded in secrecy that troops didn't know who should be putting
on the spit and polish.
   The president's itinerary included a meeting with about 2,000
U.S. and allied personnel at an air base, turkey dinner with about
1,200 soldiers in the desert, a Thanksgiving service on a U.S. Navy
ship with about 1,500 sailors, and an address to about 1,500
Marines, Seabees and British troops in a speech broadcast by Armed
Forces Radio.
   Bush and wife Barbara got a rousing welcome from a sun-baked
crowd of several thousand troops at the main U.S. air base in
Dhahran, where he spoke from an airport platform in front of parked
warplanes. Bush, wearing khaki pants and a blue shirt, waded into a
sea of military personnel dressed in desert camouflage uniforms to
shake hands and pose for pictures.
   Although the troops cheered Bush, they were largely silent when
he said he would not keep Americans in the gulf ``a single day
longer than necessary.''
   In a front-page commentary Wednesday, the English-language Saudi
Gazette called the president's visit a milestone in Saudi-American
relations.
   The newspaper said Bush won Saudi hearts by sending troops to
defend the country and will win Saudi minds if he affirms that the
United States will not let any Mideast country terrorize its
neighbors with weapons of mass destruction.
   Many servicemen welcomed the president's visit as a
morale-booster. Some said it showed America was standing tough.
   But a few said it was no big deal, appearing more interested in
the turkey and trimmings laid on for them, and in listening to a
live broadcast of the Detroit Lions vs. Denver Broncos football
game from Pontiac, Mich.
   ``I think it's exciting. I wish ... he'd come and eat with us,''
said Mrs. Law, who works full-time for the Alabama National Guard.
``I'd tell him we're ready to do something. We're ready to get it
over with so we can go home.''
   Sgt. 1st Class Mickey Kershaw, 37, of West Islip, N.Y., said if
he had the chance he'd tell Bush: ``I'd rather do it now than do it
five years from now when this guy (Saddam Hussein) nukes me - and
the family I intend to have.''
   Staff Sgt. Mike Lytle of Langley Air Force Base, Va., said
``nobody wants bloodshed'' but Americans are impatient ``and nobody
wants to sit here six months ... and wait for sanctions to take
full effect.''
   Sgt. Daniel Ralph, 27, of Philadelphia, an Army food inspector
who was checking out turkeys in a large warehouse, said Bush's
visit ``is bound to help morale.''
   But Army Reserve Spec. Bobby Lampkin, 34, of Eastman, Ga., said:
``It's no biggie. There's nothing he could tell me to justify us
being here.''
   Chief Warrant Officer Wes Wolf, 42, of Monterey, Calif., the
military food czar, said ``99.9 percent'' of the gulf forces were
dining on fresh turkey, ham and roast beef, with a shrimp cocktail
appetizer, lots of fruit and vegetables, sweet or mashed potatoes,
and a choice of five kinds of pie for dessert.
   That works out to 60,000 pounds of rolled turkey, 2,000 whole
turkeys, 70,000 pounds of roast beef, 45,000 pounds of ham, 45,000
pies and tens of thousands of pounds of other trimmings, he said.
   The Saudi government paid for half the dinner and the main Saudi
food contractor, Arab Supplies and Trading, has donated 230,000
candy bars.
   Only one or two military units were eating pre-packaged TV-style
turkey dinners known as T-rations, Wolf said. But just in case,
there were 600,000 stashed in a warehouse.
   No matter what kind of dinner they ate, most soldiers said
they'd still rather be home.
   ``It's really hard for me three years in a row being away from
my family,'' said Anibal Cabezas, 23, of New York, who is with the
82nd Aviation Brigade. ``It seems every time the holidays come we
have to go on a mission. But it's a job we have to get done. That's
what we're here for.''

<HEAD>Shevardnadze To Meet Chinese Counterpart on Gulf Crisis
^With PM-Gulf Rdp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze will meet Friday near the
Chinese-Soviet border, apparently to discuss the Persian Gulf
crisis, a Soviet Embassy spokesman said today.
   Press attache Yuri Lyssenko said he had no further details about
the talks, to be held in Urumqi in China's far western Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region.
   Asked if the meeting would focus on developments in the gulf and
related diplomatic efforts, Lyssenko replied: ``I suppose so. It
may be since Mr. Qian has just returned from that region.''
   Qian returned Nov. 13 from a Middle East diplomatic mission that
took him to Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. During his stop
in Cairo, Qian met with Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing reiterated China's
position on the gulf crisis during the weekly news briefing today,
but he did not mention the planned Chinese-Soviet talks.
   ``As long as there is still a gleam of hope for a peaceful
settlement, unremitting efforts should be continued toward this,''
Li said.
   Lyssenko said he did not know if Qian and Shevardnadze would
discuss a possible U.N. Security Council resolution sanctioning an
attack on Iraqi forces to dislodge them from Kuwait. The United
States has sought support from Security Council members for such a
resolution.
   During the news briefing, Li called the possible use of military
force in the gulf ``a very serious and complicated issue which
would have a major impact ... So it must be handled with great care
and should not be hurried through.'' The Urumqi meeting will be the
second set of talks held on short notice between Shevardnadze and
Qian since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   They met Sept. 1 in the northeastern city of Harbin with the
gulf situation as the major topic.
   Such meetings reflect the new, deepening cooperation between the
two countries since they normalized relations in 1989, ending a
three-decade split. The Soviet Union and China, as permanent
Security Council members, have veto power over resolutions. In
addition to the United States, the other permanent members are
Britain and France.
   Chinese officials have stressed that all efforts to find a
peaceful settlement to the gulf crisis must be exhausted before
considering the use of military force.
   China has supported all Security Council resolutions aimed at
forcing Iraq from Kuwait. But Chinese officials have refused to say
how the China would vote if a measure seeking authorization for
military force comes before the council.

   Michigan and Ohio residents awakened to a rainy Thanksgiving
Day, with the precipitation expected to spread as far south as
Texas, while most of the West and Midwest basked in clear but
cooler weather.
   The rain, spreading from the Great Lakes region, along the
inland edges of several East Coast states and into the South, was
caused by an unusually cold front of air from the north colliding
with a warm front moving up from the South.
   The conditions also brought rain to Kentucky early today and
cloudy or foggy skies to Massachusetts, New York, the Carolinas,
Florida, Georgia and Oklahoma.
   Clear skies blanketed most of the rest of the country, but a
winter storm watch was in effect in the Pacific Northwest. Strong
winds were reported in parts of Oregon and snow was expected
tonight in Washington and Idaho.
   Highs were in the 40s and 50s across the Northeast and Great
Lakes region, dipping into the 30s along parts of the Canadian
border. Highs were in the 60s and 70s in the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic
and most Western states, with highs in the 70s and 80s in the
South.

   The pound jumped today on the news of Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's resignation.
   The dollar moved down. Gold was up.
   Foreign exchange dealers said investors were relieved that Mrs.
Thatcher's decision had left the way clear for a new candidate who
can unify the Conservative Party and put it back on course for
another election victory over the Labor Party.
   The British pound jumped to $1.9744 in London from $1.9680 late

   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.55 yen to a closing 127.13 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 127.10 yen.
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of

<HEAD>Kohl Ties Israeli, Lebanon Questions Into Resolution Of Gulf
Crisis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl called today for a
peaceful resolution of the Persian Gulf crisis, and said ``the time
is ripe'' to solve the Arab-Israeli tensions and the Lebanon
conflict as well.
   So far, most Western leaders have resisted tying efforts to
peacefully resolve the Persian Gulf crisis in with the search for a
solution to the Palestinian conflict and Lebanon's crisis.
   In a speech to Parliament, the chancellor also repeated his
support for the creation of a United States of Europe.
   Kohl's government has been put on the spot by Iraq's
announcement on Tuesday that it would free all German hostages,
apparently in an attempt to drive a wedge into the Western alliance
that is trying to force Saddam Hussein to relinquish Kuwait.
   The chancellor said that at the Paris summit that ended on
Wednesday he found a unanimous wish ``to seek a peaceful solution''
to the crisis Saddam precipitated with Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait.
   ``None of us wants war,'' the chancellor said, stressing the
unified front against Iraq.
   Kohl said the leaders in Paris also agreed that ``the time is
ripe'' for the other conflicts in the Middle East to be solved by
negotiations.
   ``There won't be any lasting peace and security in the Middle
East and Near East until the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Lebanon
conflict are settled by negotiations,'' Kohl told the lawmakers,
drawing a round of applause.

   More than 100 European hostages, mainly
Britons and Swiss nationals, flew out of Baghdad in two chartered
planes today after Iraqi authorities freed them in response to
appeals by French and Swiss delegations.
   One group of 83 left with right-wing French politician

   The group comprised 35 Britons, 15 Italians, 15 Germans, six

Portuguese and Greek, officials with Le Pen said.
   The other group of 36 Europeans left earlier aboard a chartered

   That group consisted of 16 Swiss, four Irish nationals, four
Swedes, four Germans, four Dutch citizens, two Belgians and two
Britons, Swiss officials reported.

   President Bush, on a Thanksgiving
visit with American combat forces, said today that Iraq's efforts
to build a nuclear-weapons arsenal gives ``a real sense of
urgency'' to the U.S. military showdown with Baghdad.
   Bush and key congressional leaders hopscotched between desert
sites where 230,000 soldiers were deployed in the hot, grim work of
enforcing U.S. policy against Iraq. Bush explained the purpose of
their sacrifice thusly:
   ``We're here to protect freedom, we're here to protect our
future, we're here to protect innocent life,'' he said of the U.S.
opposition to Iraq's August invasion of Kuwait. He said, ``There
could hardly be a prouder moment than sharing Thanksgiving with
this family, this American family out here.''
   Earlier, he told a cheering crowd at the big U.S. air command
center in Dhahran: ``What we're confronting is a classic bully who
thinks he can get away with kicking sand in the face of the
world.''
   Bush won a rousing reception when he told an Army group: ``We
are not hear on some exercise... We are not walking away until our
mission is done.''
   His voice rising, Bush declared in a message to Saddam Hussein:
``Free the hostages, all the hostages and free them today or you're
going to pay the price.'' He was referring to the nearly one
thousand Americans believed to be still in Iraq and Kuwait, most of
them either in detention or not allowed to leave.
   Yet the troops were largely silent when Bush said he would not
keep Americans in the gulf ``a single day longer than necessary.''
   ``That means awhile,'' one soldier commented. ``Let's do it,''
another called out. ``Let's go get 'em today so we can go home,'
said Spec. 4 Gwendolyn Page of the 988th Supply Co. from Athens,
Ga.

<HEAD>500-Day Plan Architect Quits Russian Parliament</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN IAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Russian Parliament today accepted the
resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Grigory Yavlinsky, co-author
of a radical 500-day plan for transition to a market economy, the
official Tass news agency said.
   Yavlinsky formally offered his resignation to the Russian
lawmakers on Oct. 17, after President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
presented an alternative plan that had no time limit. Lawmakers
delayed a vote on Yavlinsky's resignation to give him time to
reconsider.
   Tass said Yavlinsky offered his resignation because the
Gorbachev plan was virtually under way nationwide and ``realization
of the 500-day program, as Yavlinsky put it, was unrealistic.''
   Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin, Gorbachev's chief rival, has
moved ahead with the 500-day plan in Russia, by far the largest of
the Soviet Union's 15 republics.
   Today, Russian Prime Minister Ivan Silayev urged the republic's
lawmakers to accept Yavlinsky's resignation. ``I do this with
regret, but Yavlinsky wants to work in another capacity,'' Tass
quoted Silayev as saying.
   Deputies voted 164 to 17 to accept the resignation, the
independent news agency Interfax reported.
   Yavlinsky's resignation came a day after Yeltsin declared that
Soviet republics could no longer wait for a union treaty to be
approved. He said they were proceeding on their own to create a new
economic union.
   Yeltsin on Wednesday signed a treaty with the republic of
Kazakstan, the fourth bilateral treaty with another republic.
   The treaty with the Central Asian republic would set up direct
economic, politial and cultural ties. Yeltsin signed a treaty with
the Ukraine on Monday and earlier concluded pacts with Moldavia and
Georgia.
   The move by Yeltsin, Gorbachev's main political rival, indicated
he was moving to consolidate support among the republics. The two
leaders have been locked in a power struggle over their divergent
plans for rescuing the economy and holding the country together,
resulting in a paralysis of power.
   ``These bilateral treaties could constitute a major, solid
foundation for the future signing of a new Union Treaty,'' Yeltsin
said at a news conference after the signing. At the same time, he
said, they would help prevent economic chaos until such a treaty
could be signed.
   Since Nov. 1, Yeltsin and his government have gone ahead with
their own 500-day transition program, drafted by a group of
economists headed by Yavlinsky and economist Stanislav Shatalin.
   But, legislators in the country's largest republic have been
stymied because they do not have clear control of prices, currency,
interest rates, land and real estate.
   The national legislature, the Supreme Soviet, agreed Oct. 19 on
a compromise economic plan endorsed by Gorbachev that is a slower
and less radical step away from central planning to a market
economy.

   Later, when Bush visited an Army encampment, Capt. Michael
Stevens of Miami said morale was generally high. ``It's great that
he came. It gives us all a sign that he cares.''
   Bush then traveled toward the front lines of the Persian Gulf
crisis for an appearance carried live in the United States on
breakfast-time TV.
   For security reasons, the White House forbid publication of the
president's precise location, but Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf,
commander of U.S. forces, said Bush and his wife Barbara would be
within 80 miles of the border with Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. The
president called it ``an unforgettable visit,'' and left with ``a
prayer in our hearts, a prayer on our lips.''
   ``God bless you all, God bless our faithful allies,'' Bush said.
   Bush was the first president to visit with U.S. troops in the
field since then-President Richard M. Nixon's July 1969 visit to
South Vietnam.
   From his first stop in Dhahran, Bush boarded a helicopter to
visit troops at remote locations and to share Thanksgiving dinner.
The military arranged to serve a holiday meal - shrimp cocktail,
turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes and cranberry sauce - to all the
American forces stationed around the gulf.
   The Bushes got a rousing welcome from a sun-baked crowd of
several thousand troops at Dhahran, where he spoke from an airport
platform in front of parked warplanes. Bush, wearing khaki pants
and an open-collar blue shirt, waded into a sea of military
personnel dressed in desert camouflage uniforms to shake hands and
pose for pictures.
   In a brief speech, Bush said the United States has acted with
restraint, ``as is our way,'' against Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein. ``But Saddam is making the mistake of his life if he
confuses an abundance of restraint and patience with a lack of
resolve,'' he said.
   ``And every day that passes brings Saddam Hussein one step
closer to realizing his goal of a nuclear weapons arsenal,'' Bush
said. ``And, frankly, that's another reason why more, and more, our
mission is marked by a real sense of urgency.''
   It was a theme he struck again in his speech near the front.
   American and Israeli experts believe Iraq is at least five to 10
years away from building nuclear weapons, but Bush said no one
should be certain of such a timetable.
   ``No one knows precisely when this dictator may acquire atomic
weapons or exactly who they may be aimed at down the road. But we
do know this for sure: he's never possessed a weapon he didn't
use,'' Bush said.
   Today was the first time Bush has cited Iraq's nuclear program
as a major reason for confronting Saddam. The president had said
Wednesday he planned to tell U.S. troops they were not in Saudi
Arabia on some ``mission impossible.''

   Brent Scowcrowft, in an interview, said Bush was stressing the
nuclear aspect as a message to those who urge longer waits to see
if economic sanctions work and ``people who say, wait a year, two
years...''
   ``If we had to use force after he had nuclear weapons, it would
be a whole different operation,'' Scowcroft said.
   Bush told the troops:
   ``No president - none at all - is quick to order American troops
abroad. ``But there are times when all nations that value freedom
must confront aggression.
   ``Sometimes it's a question of some pain - some pain now to
avoid even worse pain later,'' he said.
   He met with members of the Army's 197th Infantary brigate,
located in Fort Benning, Ga. and other assorted troops brought in.
Sand was everywhere in the air, and huge clouds billowed as Bush's
helicopter landed.
   The president and his wife waited in a chow line to get the food
in a tent covered with camouflage netting, then joined the troops,
eating at tables that were no more than slabs of plywood placed
atop sandbags. Soldiers leaned their M-16 rifles up against their
tables as they ate.
   Bush gave the troops a set of horsehoes, which he said could be
won in a drawing. He said he and his sons would challenge the
winner to play with them back at the White House horsehoe pits.
``My boys and I can whup you,'' he cautioned the yet-unknown
winner.
   Bush also choppered to the USS Nassau, a helicopter carrier in
the gulf. The final stop was at a forward-based Marine command post
where Marines, Navy Seabees and British ``Desert Rat'' armored
forces were assembled.
   The president was flying late in the day to Cairo and meetings
with President Hosni Mubarak. He will fly to Geneva Friday to meet
with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III accompanied the president
to Saudi Arabia, but split off to fly to Yemen today to seek
support for a United Nations resolution authorizing military force
to drive Iraq out of Kuwait.

   ``Today'' newscaster Faith Daniels is getting a
new NBC News daytime series that will examine social issues while
CBS is putting Nell Carter in a new Saturday night comedy, the
networks announced.
   NBC, trying to bolster its third-place daytime schedule, said
Wednesday that Daniels' midday series, ``A Closer Look,'' will
replace the soap opera ``Generations,'' which had drawn low
ratings.
   Daniels will continue with ``Today.'' ``A Closer Look'' debuts
Jan. 28.
   Seven other possible news-information series are in development,
NBC said, including ``Women's Diaries'' with former NBC News star
Linda Ellerbee.
   Although ``Generations'' has trailed in its time period, various
black groups had campaigned to save the soap opera, which broke new
ground when it premiered in March 1989 by focusing on a black
family as well as a white family.
   Carter's new series, ``You Take the Kids,'' is set to debut Dec.
15 on CBS. She and Roger E. Mosley star as parents of a blue-collar
family in Pittsburgh. Carter previously starred in ``Gimme a
Break,'' while Mosley was in ``Magnum P.I.''
   ``Lenny,'' which was pulled from its Wednesday night slot on CBS
because of low ratings, will also move to Saturdays on Dec. 15, the
network said.
   To make room, CBS is dropping ``The Hogan Family'' and ``The
Family Man.'' The network said it is canceling ``The Hogan
Family,'' which was picked up after NBC dropped it last season. It
said it will bring ``The Family Man'' back to the air next spring.

<HEAD>Shock, Delight, or Flowers: Reaction to Thatcher's Resignation
Varies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conservative Party colleagues of Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher expressed shock and amazement at her decision
Thursday to resign, although some said she had done the right
thing.
   The opposition Labor Party members said they were delighted.
   Conservative lawmaker Peter Thurnham turned up at Mrs.
Thatcher's 10 Downing Street office with two dozen red roses for
her.
   ``In condolence?'' a reporter asked.
   ``Yes,'' Thurnham replied bluntly.
   More flowers turned up throughout the day from admirers around
the country. They included lilies, seen as a symbol of a passing
era. Mrs. Thatcher said she will step down as prime minister when a
new party leader was chosen.
   ``Thank you for all you have done for our country,'' said a
message attached to one bunch.
   Kenneth Baker, Conservative Party chairman, said: ``I am very
saddened indeed that our greatest peacetime prime minister has left
government. She is an outstanding leader not only of our country
and the world and I do not believe we will see her like again.''
   Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock was cheerful following Mrs'
Thatcher's announcement, calling it, ``Good, very good indeed.''
   ``I cannot pretend otherwise. Let's have a general election
now,'' said Kinnock, whose party has led recent public opinion
polls.
   Paddy Ashdown, leader of the smaller opposition Liberal
Democrats, said: ``The prime minister has taken the right decision
for her own reputation, for the unity of her party, and for the
good of Britain.''
   ``I just can't believe it has happened,'' said James Spicer,
Conservative vice chairman and a close friend of Mrs. Thatcher.
   He added, in a reference to politicians who were dismissed or
resigned from Mrs. Thatcher's government: ``I don't know quite what
the reaction will be worldwide. I am sure it will be shock and
amazement that someone of her caliber can have ended her career
like this - pulled down by a mixture of envy and dislike borne of
being cast aside.''
   Sir John Stokes, Conservative Party lawmaker, said the party had
thrown out its greatest leader.
   ``The age of chivalry has gone and disloyalty has triumphed.''
   Conservative lawmaker John Hannam thought Mrs. Thatcher had had
a ``very good chance'' of winning the next round of voting in the
party's process of choosing their leader.
   But he conceded Mrs. Thatcher had to consider whether she could
carry on without the full backing of the party's 372 legislators.
   Fellow Conservative Neville Trotter said: ``I think she has done
the right thing. She has put the interests of the party first.''
   Trotter said the leadership election would take place in a
``calmer, cooler atmosphere'' now that Mrs. Thatcher had resigned.
   ``She will always be remembered as one of the greatest political
leaders in our history,'' said Sir Geoffrey Howe, a close colleague
of Mrs. Thatcher for 15 years.
   But it was Howe's resignation as deputy prime minister on Nov. 1
in protest at what he saw as Mrs. Thatcher's negative attitudes to
European integration that was crucial in forcing the leadership
contest.
   On Nov. 14, former Defense Minister Michael Heseltine announced
a formal challenge to Mrs. Thatcher's leadership. He gathered
enough votes Tuesday to force Mrs. Thatcher to a second ballot -
and he appeared to be picking up strength, leading to Mrs.
Thatcher's decision to resign.
   A tribute to Mrs. Thatcher had been written in the Cabinet
record for Thursday.
   It read in part: ``We thank you most warmly for your leadership
and we extend to both you and your husband (retired oil executive
Denis Thatcher) who has supported you so marvelously, all our best
wishes for the future. Your place in our country's history is
already assured.''

   The giant balloon heroes of the Macy's parade
drew oohs and ahs in New York City, while across the nation
millions of Thanksgiving feasts were being prepared today for
soldiers, the homeless and others.
   The television bad boy and a dozen other big balloons rolled
down Manhattan streets today as the 64th annual Macy's Thanksgiving
Day parade got under way shortly after 9 a.m.
   The weather was just about perfect for a parade: sunny with
temperatures in the low 40s, a welcome change from last year's five
inches of snow.
   The celebration began early as parents brought their children to
Central Park on Wednesday night to see balloons being prepared.
   The nationally televised parade, with ``Today'' show celebrities
Deborah Norville and Willard Scott as hosts, included a cartoon
celebrity lineup that featured spike-haired underachiever Bart
Simpson, making his first appearance, and Kermit the Frog,
returning after a three-year absence.
   The poignancy of Kermit's return was not missed by Paul Oppold,
27, of New York, who stopped smiling as he peered at the giant frog
whose creator, Jim Henson, died earlier this year.
   ``Kermit makes me sad,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, at military bases around the nation, turkey with all
the trimmings was being prepared for families of servicemen
spending Thanksgiving in the Persian Gulf and for soldiers expected
to ship out after the holiday.
   ``We expect a big turnout,'' said Richard Olson, a spokesman at
Fort Stewart in Hinesville, Ga., where post officials planned to
feed about 5,500 people. ``Wives are getting together decorations.
There is a big push to get the families to come in and eat in the
dining facilities.''
   In Jacksonville, N.C., the town surrounding the Camp Lejeune
Marine Corps Base, more than 300 civilians held a candlelight
Thanksgiving service Wednesday. Some 30,000 base Marines are
awaiting word on deployment orders that will take them to the
Persian Gulf.
   ``We are thankful that our nation has the moral courage and
physical strength to resist the aggression of a mad man,'' Brig.
Gen. Charles Krulak, commanding general of the 2nd Marine Fourth
Service Support Group at Camp Lejeune, told the service.
   Also around the nation, volunteers were preparing holiday
dinners for thousands of poor and homeless people.
   In Los Angeles, such celebrities as actors Jeff and Lloyd
Bridges, Ed Asner, Leonard Nimoy, Cesar Romero, Earl Holliman and
Heather Locklear and her husband, Motley Crue drummer Tommy Lee,
served holiday dinners a day early Wednesday to some 30,000
homeless people.
   The annual feast at the Los Angeles Mission was offered early to
allow poor people to take advantage of meals planned by other
relief agencies today, said the Rev. Mark Holsinger, the mission's
director.

   Prime Minister Poul Schlueter today
called early elections for Dec. 12 after his minority government
failed to gain support in parliament for its economic program.
   Talks broke down late Wednesday between Schlueter's center-right
coalition and the main opposition Social Democrats on an economic
package that included tax reform.
   Denmark's personal income taxes average around 52 percent and
climb progressively to 68 percent, the second-highest in Europe
after Sweden.
   Despite agreement on the need to cut taxes, the political
factions differ about how to fill the gap in state revenues left by
a proposed tax break while staying within the government's tight
1991 draft budget.
   A total of 13 parties will be contesting seats in the 179-seat
legislature, where Schlueter commands only 67 votes. The Social
Democrats have 55 seats.
   Since his Conservative-led government could not muster a
majority in the Folketing, or parliament, for its draft budget,
Schlueter announced the election without the traditional debate.
   Some commentators questioned whether the ballot was really
necessary. A regular election is already scheduled for next year.
   But Schleuter said elections were needed now to give the
government the authority to carry out tax reforms without further
delay.
   ``It is necessary to get it over with as quickly as possible,''
he said in a short statement.
   Economy Minister Niels Helveg Petersen, leader of the
Social-Liberal Party, the junior coalition partner, said he
regretted the election call at a time when the two sides had
narrowed their differences.
   ``The coalition parties will campaign singly and together to
gain the extra backing needed to carry out its economic package,''
said Petersen.
   Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the foreign minister and leader of the
Liberal Party -the senior coalition partner - welcomed the poll.
   He said there were major differences in principle between the
government and the Social Democrats on taxes and economic policy.
The government would continue to work for tax relief,
Ellemann-Jensen said.
   Social Democratic leader Svend Auken said the party would run on
a platform of fuller employment, environmental protection and tax
breaks for middle income groups. The jobless rate stands at 9.8
percent.
   Auken criticized Schlueter for wanting to give tax relief to the
affluent while running up a $5.3 billion budget deficit.
   The coalition parties - Conservatives, Liberals and Social
Liberals - had agreed with the Social Democrats on lowering income
taxes at the top of the scale to bring them more into line with
those of Denmark's European Community partners.

   Emperor Akihito today began the most controversial
ceremony in his accession to the Chrysanthemum Throne, a communion
with the mythical sun goddess from whom legend says the imperial
line descended.
   The Shinto rite has been performed by most of Japan's monarchs
since at least the seventh century, and in the past was believed to
give monarchs their status as living gods.
   But protests were held across the country against the
state-funded rite, which has been criticized by many Japanese as
violating the constitution's separation of church and state.
   Hundreds of scholars in the north and labor unionists in the
west held peaceful demontrations, while hundreds of Christians
nationwide fasted.
   About 30,000 police were assigned to security in Tokyo alone
because of the threat of violence by ultra-leftist radicals who
want to abolish the monarchy.
   As the ceremony began this evening, radicals fired six metal
projectiles from homemade mortar-like launchers at an imperial
villa in Kyoto, western Japan, police said.
   Radicals were believed responsible for a fire that destroyed a
Shinto shrine in southern Japan today, police said. On Wednesday,
anti-monarchy radicals shoveled human waste from a truck near the
Imperial Palace.
   Akihito, 56, is the first Japanese emperor to be enthroned not
as a god-king but as a symbol of his people's sovereignty. But that
has not diminished the pomp and ceremony of his multimillion-dollar
coronation.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, dressed in a swallow-tailed coat,
arrived at the palace this evening to attend the communion, one of
the final events surrounding the enthronement. Nearly 900 Japanese
dignitaries were expected to attend.
   Unlike Akihito's formal state enthronement ceremony Nov. 12 that
was viewed by foreign dignitaries representing 158 countries, no
foreigners were invited to the communion, which is to end before
dawn Friday.
   During the rite, called the Daijosai or Great Food Offering
Ritual, Akihito offers rice, wine and other foods from around the
country to the sun goddess Amaterasu, from whom legend says the
imperial line descended.
   Only two female attendants, clad in white and red kimono and
with their hair tied in pony tails nearly 6{ feet long, witness the
Daijosai. The ceremony is held in the torch-lit inner sanctuary of
a specially built hall on the palace grounds. The rite is performed
only once by each emperor.
   Akihito, wearing his most holy white silk robes for the rite and
surrounded by court chamberlains, slowly proceeded to the
sanctuary, led by two attendants lighting the way with torches.
   Other attendants carried a large parasol over Akihito's head, or
unrolled a rush mat before him. Yet another rolled up the mat
behind the emperor after each deliberate step.
   Inside the sanctuary, out of view of the 733 Japanese guests
seated in large tents nearby, the offerings were to be made to an
altar placed beside a stylized bed, from which the goddess is
summoned.
   Scholars before World War II theorized that at one time the
ceremony might have involved the emperor symbolically having sex
with the sun goddess, representing a union with the divine. Palace
officials, however, deny that theory and said the emperor would not
touch the bed.
   After the first communion this evening, the ceremony was to be
repeated after midnight in an identical hall located just yards
away from the first one. Haunting court music was to be played
throughout.
   Akihito, like his father, the late Emperor Hirohito, performs
dozens of religious ceremonies at the palace each year, carrying on
the priest-king role that has been handed down from ancient times.
   That role, however, has periodically come under fire since the
end of World War II, and opposition political parties, Christian
organizations and other groups claim the government is violation
the constitutional separation of church and state by spending an
estimated $17 million on the coronation rites.
   Hirohito, who died in January 1989 at age 87, renounced the
concept of imperial divinity on New Year's Day 1946, at the urging
of the U.S.-led occupation forces. The country's post-war
constitution specifies that the emperor is a national symbol, and
not a god-king as tradition had had it.
   Critics say repeating the Shinto rites for Akihito's
enthronement could encourage a return to the feverish
emperor-worship that helped lead the nation into war.

   President Bush,
learning of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's decision to
resign while he was visiting American troops deep in the Saudi
desert, praised the British leader as ``an outstanding ally of the
United States.''
   ``You always know where she was and what she believed,'' Bush
told reporters at a Marine outpost not far from the Kuwaiti border.
``She has always been an outstanding ally of the United States.''
   The president learned of Mrs. Thatcher's decision from his press
secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, during his tour of military
encampments in the Saudi Desert. That tour included a visit to a
group of British ``Desert Rats'' soldiers.
   ``You know of my high regard for Prime Minister Thatcher,'' Bush
said. ``We obviously will work with the next prime minister and I
expect they will stay right on course with us.''
   ``In a personal sense, I would send my best to her,'' Bush said.
``I will miss her.''
   At one point during his tour, a Marine was overheard telling the
president he was surprised Mrs. Thatcher had resigned. ``I thought
she'd duke it out,'' the Marine said. ``So did I,'' the president
replied.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the ``Iron
Lady'' to the end, announced her resignation today after 11{ years
of power - and then ordered more British troops to the Persian
Gulf.
   The startling news that Britain's first woman prime minister
would call it quits came only one day after she had vowed: ``I
fight on, I fight to win.''
   The seemingly indomitable Mrs. Thatcher, Europe's
longest-serving leader, was driven out by a rebellion in the ranks
of her Conservative party, which now faces a three-man race to
succeed her.
   The troop deployment was decided at the same Cabinet meeting in
which the prime minister was warned that she would lose to Michael
Heseltine in the second round of the Conservative Party leadership
election. Under Britain's parliamentary system, the leader of the
majority party is the prime minister.
   The prime minister had been sinking in the polls amid
dissatisfaction over tax policies and high inflation.
   Mrs. Thatcher had failed on Tuesday to decisively fend off a
challenge by the popular Michael Heseltine, who resigned as her
defense minister in 1986, in the first round of voting by
Conservative members of Parliament.
   ``I have concluded the unity of the party and prospects of
victory in a general election would be better served if I stood
down to enable Cabinet colleagues to enter the ballot for the
leadership,'' Mrs. Thatcher said in a statement released by her
office.
   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and treasury chief John Major,
released from the obligations of loyalty, both jumped into the
race, saying they were joining in ``a friendly contest.''
   Wearing a royal blue suit and pearls as she faced a packed House
of Commons on Thursday, Mrs. Thatcher appeared calm and in command.
Fielding a friendly question, she said: ``Yes ... I do look back
with some pride and some satisfaction at our achievements for our
country over the last 11{ years.''
   Conservative lawmaker Anthony Marlow told her it was a time of
sadness and happiness.
   ``Sadness for her, from the great well of affection that exists
for here in the house. Happiness in celebration of what has been,
is and will remain, the greatest peacetime political reign of this
century,'' Marlow said.
   When opposition Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock pressed his
demand for a national election, Mrs. Thatcher said that was no more
in the cards than it was when Labor Prime Minister Harold Wilson
resigned in 1976 and was succeeded by James Callaghan.
   Speaking in the House of Commons, Defense Secretary Tom King
said the new deployment in the Persian Gulf would involve 14,000
troops, bringing the total number of British soldiers in Saudi
Arabia to more than 30,000.
   That would make the British troop commmitment to the
multinational forces arrayed against Iraq in the gulf the
second-largest behind the United States, which has deployed 250,000
soldiers and promised another 100,000.
   Earlier, Mrs. Thatcher smiled but said nothing to reporters as
she left her office to go to Buckingham Palace to inform Queen
Elizabeth II of her decision. Her office said her resignation would
take effect as soon as her party has a new leader.
   The announcement that Mrs. Thatcher would resign came barely 2{
hours before the deadline for nominations. In next Tuesday's second
round of voting, only a simple majority will be needed to win.
   Mrs. Thatcher has been assailed for imposing a new per capita
tax on local services that makes princes pay the same as paupers.
The dissatisfaction hit new heights several weeks ago when she
resisted backing monetary union for the European Community at a
meeting of its leaders.
   Heseltine, 57, has promised a more ``caring capitalism,'' a
review of the local services tax and closer ties to the 12-nation
European Community.
   Labor had been leading the Conservatives in the polls for 16
months, but several recent surveys showed the Conservatives leading
if Heseltine were the leader.
   Heseltine won enough votes in the first round of balloting among
the 372 Conservative members of 650-seat House of Commons to deny
Mrs. Thatcher an outright victory, and many observers saw that
failure as tantamount to defeat.
   Labor leader Neil Kinnock hailed the news of his nemesis'
departure.
   ``Good. Very good indeed. I cannot pretend otherwise,'' Kinnock
said.
   Whoever becomes prime minister must call new parliamentary
elections by mid-1992.
   Mrs. Thatcher, struggling to stay in power, had rushed back on
Wednesday from a European summit in Paris, changed campaign
managers and tried to hustle votes in the Commons tearoom.
   Shares on the London Stock Exchange shot higher following the
news Mrs. Thatcher was withdrawing from the leadership challenge.

   Here is a transcript of President
Bush's remarks at a U.S. Marine outpost Thursday.
   Q: (Off mike) - disproportionate share of the burden. Our troops
outnumber the other forces here something like four to one.
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Well, we're by far the largest country and also
when you're the leader in the world for peace and for freedom, you
bear a disproportionate responsibility and we're prepared to do
that. I'm pleased that 23 countries are involved. I'm pleased that
other forces are moving in. I saw the ... Desert Rats here today
and I'm very proud once again we're shoulder to shoulder with the
Brits, for example. We have Arab forces here. But we're the United
States of America, and we have a disproportionate responsibility to
lead and to stand for something and that's what we're doing. And
that's -
   Q: Speaking of the Brits, what is your reaction to Margaret
Thatcher's decision to resign?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Well, of course, you know of my high regard for
Prime Minister Thatcher and I - we will obviously work with the
next prim minister and I expect that knowing the fiber there that
they'll stay right on course with us. But on a very personal sense,
I would express my - my - send my best to her at this difficult
time. She's been a staunch friend and ally. She's a woman of
principle. She stood for what she believes. You always know where
she was and what she believed. And I think everybody in America
would agree that Margaret Thatcher has been an outstanding ally for
the United States. And I, you know, am certain that this will
continue with the United Kingdom. But on a personal basis, I'll
miss her because I value her counsel. I value her long experience,
that - the wisdom that comes from her long experience. And she has
been an outstanding prime minister for the United Kingdom and an
outstanding friend of the United States.
   Q: Mr. President ... what did you learn by walking in the same
footsteps as the soldiers you sent -
   PRESIDENT BUSH: I learned a lot about the kids just from looking
them in the eye. And I learned once again something I already knew,
how lucky we are to have this all volunteer force as strong, as
well trained and as highly motivated as they are. And I they're
just like my own kids. Probably wish they were home. It's
Thanksgiving Day in the United States. And I learned that they're
willing to be apart from their own loved ones, because they feel it
is their duty and their obligation.
   Q: Had you -
   PRESIDENT BUSH: And they're strong and they're tough, and
they're - I - I've been very moved by today, I'll tell you.
   Q: Had you been concerned about the morale, sir, given the fact
that it's almost four months now, and they've had no - nothing to
fight?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Well, I think the waiting is a difficult -
difficult part of this, but I think they, like their president,
would prefer a peaceful solution. But like their president, I sense
a certain resolve on their part that if they have to do something
they're prepared to do it. And they want to do it and do it fast.
And they want to do it and get it over. And I can understand that.
I was in their shape forty-some years ago today - forty-six. And -
so I - I - I've been very moved and motivated myself by this. And
I'll go the extra mile for peace. We've been doing it. We've been
showing patience and restraint. But I also know that this Saddam
Hussein is cruel and he's brutal, and he's violating the rights of
individuals. And I don't believe there's a Marine out here, or an
Army person, or a Navy person, or an Air Force man or woman, or a
British rat, or our Arab allies, that are not as upset as I am
about the way innocent civilians are being treated. And I'll damn
sure tell you I'm upset about it. And we'll try the peaceful route.
We're trying it. But there will be no compromise with this kind of
aggression. We're not going to compromise.
   Q: Sir, you talked -
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Thank you all.
   Q: - evasively today about a nuclear - Saddam's nuclear
capability.
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Yes, I'm concerned about that.
   Q: What's behind this? Is -
   PRESIDENT BUSH: There's nothing behind it. It's just the fact
that I think the longer it goes one, why, I'm concerned about it.
That's what's behind it.
   Q: You have new information that it's closer than you thought
before?
   Q: Just - I would just stay with what I said here today. And I -
when I said that he is - remember that he's used every weapon he's
had, I'm thinking primarily of the brutality of those chemical
weapons that he did use on his own people. And I hope the American
people understand this more clearly now. But I darn sure get the
feeling that the people out here understand it. Thank you all.
   Q: President Bush, this is an emotional day for you, sir, wasn't
it?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: It was a very emotional day for me, and I - I'm
- I think we are very fortunate to have this kind of dedicated
young man and young woman in the sands of Saudi Arabia today. And
it's only the United States that can lead like this. It's only the
United States of America. And we have others with us, but these are
the ones that are doing the heavy lifting. And God bless them all.

   A Prince William County police officer and
an unidentified gunman were killed early today in a shootout
outside a Dale City home.
   Officer Philip Michael Pennington was a member of the Prince
William police SWAT team sent to the home to investigate the
wounding of an Arlington County deputy earlier Thursday, a Prince
William County police spokesman said.
   SWAT team members and Arlington police converged on the house
about 6:30 a.m., spokesman Sgt. Barry Bernard said.
   ``At that time there was an exchange of gunfire. As a result of
that we had one Prince William County police officer who is dead.
We also have an unidentified male dead at the scene,'' Bernard
said.
   Arlington County police spokesman Tom Bell said the officers
were trying to serve an arrest warrant for the shooting of
Arlington County Sheriff's Capt. Daryl Laclair.
   Laclair, 36 and a 10-year veteran, was shot in the face and left
elbow as he approached a car on a busy county highway shortly after
midnight Thursday, Bell said.
   ``A motorist pulled beside him in the left lane and motioned for
him to stop. After pulling over, he was proceeding toward the car
and the motorist got out and fired three shots,'' Bell said.
   The wounded Laclair shot out the rear window of the motorists'
gold Buick as the car sped away, Bell said. Laclair was admitted to
Arlington Hospital, where he was listed in satisfactory condition.
   A witness reported the Buick's license number to police, who
traced it to the Dale City home, Bell said.

<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with Britain to send more troops to
gulf, some American hostages brought to Baghdad for Thanksgiving
dinner</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush gave thanks with U.S. troops in the Saudi desert
today, and Britain announced it was almost doubling the number of
military personnel it has deployed in the Persian Gulf.
   Saddam Hussein, meanwhile, released more than 100 European
hostages today, but American captives in Iraq marked a Thanksgiving
full of fear and uncertainty.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III was in Yemen seeking
support for a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing force
against Iraq.
   Bush became the first U.S. president to visit front-line troops
since President Richard M. Nixon made a 1969 trip to South Vietnam.
   ``What we're confronting is a classic bully who thinks he can
get away with kicking sand in the face of the world,'' he told
soldiers and airmen at an Air Force command center in Dhahran.
   Britain's Defense Secretary Tom King said the new deployment in
the Persian Gulf would involve 14,000 troops, bringing the total
number of British military personnel in Saudi Arabia to more than
30,000.
   That would make the British troop commmitment to the
multinational forces arrayed against Iraq in the gulf the
second-largest behind the United States, which has deployed 250,000
soldiers and promised another 100,000.
   The European hostages, mainly Britons and Swiss, left Baghdad
today aboard two chartered planes. Saddam had freed them in reponse
to appeals by French and Swiss delegations.
   One group of 83 left with right-wing French politician
Jean-Marie Le Pen for Strasbourg, France aboard an Iraqi Airways
jetliner. Another 36 Europeans left earlier aboard a chartered
Swissair jet for Zurich with a five-member Swiss parliamentary
delegation.
   Hundreds of Americans are still held in Iraq, some of them
detained as ``human shields'' at key installations. Twelve American
captives were brought to a swank Baghdad country club by Iraqi
authorities for a Thanksgiving meal of turkey.
   One of the hostages, Donald Whitely, 49, of Shreveport, La.,
said he hoped he would be freed soon because his father was
seriously ill and ``I want to see him before he dies.''
   Some of the catives were reunited with members of their
families who had flown to Baghdad to see them against U.S.
government advice.
   In Germany, Chancellor Helmut Kohl called today for a peaceful
resolution of the Persian Gulf crisis, and said ``the time is
ripe'' to solve the Arab-Israeli tensions and the Lebanon conflict
as well.
   So far, most Western leaders have resisted linking efforts to
peacefully resolve the crisis with the search for a solution to the
Palestinian question and Lebanon's more than 15-year-old civil war.
   The U.S. buildup in the gulf region has led to a manpower
squeeze in the military, and there were reports today that the Army
has decided to halt retirements and discharges for the duration of
the crisis.
   The alliance that has gathered armies, navies and air forces in
the region in response to Iraq's seizure of Kuwait is enforcing a
U.N.-ordered trade embargo that aims to drive the Iraqis out of
Kuwait.
   But the embargo is widely thought by allied leaders to be slow
in squeezing the Iraqis. Bush lobbied hard during this week's
European security summit in Paris for support for a U.N. resolution
authorizing military action to drive Iraq out of Kuwait.
   In Paris, Both Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and French
President Francois Mitterrand on Wednesday called for a U.N.
Security Council meeting to determine what further action should be
taken against Iraq.
   Baker has also pursued a resolution on the use of force in
meetings over the past week with the foreign ministers of eight of
the U.N. Security Council's 15 members. Today, he traveled to
Yemen, which is the only Arab member of the Security Council.
   Yemen has abstained in voting on about half of the 10 Security
Council resolutions condemning Iraq for grabbing Kuwait.
   U.N. officials say the Bush administration wants a vote on the
military strike resolution next week because it holds the Security
Council's rotating presidency this month and must cede it to Yemen
in December.
   In eastern Saudi Arabia, Bush and his wife Barbara got a rousing
welcome from several thousand troops.
   He told the troops the United States has acted with restraint
against Iraq so far, but warned: ``Saddam is making the mistake of
his life if he confuses an abundance of restraint and patience with
a lack of resolve.''
   In his speech, Bush for the first time cited Iraq's nuclear
program as a major reason for confronting Saddam.
   American and Israeli experts believe Iraq is five to 10 years
away from building nuclear weapons. Even so, the president said,
``every day that passes brings Saddam Hussein one step closer to
realizing his goal of a nuclear weapons arsenal.''

<HEAD>With PM-Britain-Thatcher, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Reagan today called the
resignation of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher a selfless
act, and praised her as a bold and visionary ally during his own
years of power.
   ``As she has done throughout her career in public service,
Margaret Thatcher has made a selfless and courageous decision in
what she believes is the best interests of her country,'' Reagan
said in a statement.
   ``I could always count on her wise counsel, her firm support,
and her loyal friendship,'' he said. ``Margaret Thatcher is truly a
world statesman.''
   Thatcher failed Tuesday to decisively fend off a challenge by
the popular Michael Heseltine, who resigned as her defense minister
in 1986, in the first round of voting by Conservative members of
Parliament. She at first vowed to fight to win in a second round of
voting set for next week. But today, Thatcher announced her
resignation, saying it was for the good of the party.
   During her 11{ years in power, Britain's first female prime
minister found a close ally in Reagan, who shared many of her
political philosophies.
   Thatcher, unequivocally pro-American in foreign policy, was a
champion of free markets and private enterprise, as was Reagan.
   While the 1980s era of Reaganomics saw the United States become
more and more deeply mired in debt, the British economy thrived on
the Iron Lady's radical policies.
   ``Through her bold and visionary policies, Margaret Thatcher
restored Great Britain to prosperity and improved the quality of
life for all her people,'' Reagan said.

<HEAD>Dessert Dilemma: What to Do With 1,000 Pounds of Raspberry Goo?</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   What do you do with 1,000 pounds of
raspberry goo? If you're smart, you'll put it in a tart, and not
down a storm drain, hoping it'll be washed away by a good rain.
   Evan D. Hansen was fined $500 for dumping the dessert, raspberry
gelatin and whipped cream, down a storm drain, violating the
state's Water Pollution Control Act.
   Hansen was faced with the dessert dilemma following a Sept. 5
contest in which participants attempted to perform the most
outrageous stunts to win $5,000 from a local radio station.
   Hansen won by cutting the roof from a station wagon, filling it
with raspberry gelatin and topping it with whipped cream. He then
dressed in a white tuxedo, jumped in the gelatin and drove the car
across the parking lot.
   Problems occurred when he tried to get rid of the goo. Hansen
said he hired a waste disposal company to remove the gelatin from
his car but their pump clogged. So he dumped it into a storm drain,
which empties into Big Cottonwood Creek.
   ``I knew t was biodegradable and figured the rain would take
care of it,'' said Hansen. ``I'm sure there was absolutely no
damage.''
   Kent Miner, director of water quality and hazardous waste for
the Salt Lake City-County Health Department, said the environmental
consequences of the illegal discharge were minor, but the law
mandates a fine for the unauthorized release of wastes into a
stream.

   Guerrillas set off a mortar
barrage in the capital before dawn Thursday, awakening residents
and rattling windows but causing only minor damage, authorities
said.
   In the provincial capital of San Miguel, 75 miles east of San
Salvador, military sources said five soldiers were killed in an
overnight guerrilla mortar attack on the headquarters of the 3rd
army brigade. The sources said four other soldiers were wounded in
the attack, during which five rebel projectiles fell inside the
compound.
   The attacks were the latest in a guerrilla operation begun
Tuesday with battles in seven of El Salvador's 14 provinces. The
leftist guerrillas have been fighting a succession of U.S-backed
conservative governments for a decade, and more than 72,000 people
have been killed.
   Elsewhere, military sources reported combat between government
troops and leftist insurgents early Thursday in San Jose Guayabal,
11 miles northeast of San Salvador, and Mercedes Umana, 50 miles
east of the capital.
   The sources said guerrillas and soldiers also battled in
Jucuapa, 60 miles east of San Salvador, and in Torola, near the
Honduran border in the northeastern province of Morazan.
   No casualties apart from those in San Miguel were immediately
reported from the renewed fighting, part of a rebel offensive that
began Tuesday and has killed about 80 people wounded nearly 270.
   In San Salvador, powerful rebel-launched homemade mortars
damaged a metal high-tension wire tower just outside the San
Antonio Abad power station on the city's northwestern edge before
dawn, officials said.
   Two of the seven or eight projectiles launched at the station
landed about 150 yards from the utility and damaged two private
homes.
   Shortly after the barrage, two air force helicopters strafed and
rocketed the slopes of the San Salvador volcano looming above the
power station. Several hundred guerrillas are believed to be based
on the mountain.

<TEXT>
   As proud family members watched, 154 new
prison guards graduated from the state Correctional Academy - but
then they were promptly told by their boss that they're being laid
off.
   ``The hard part is six weeks ago these guys gave up jobs to work
for me ... and now they're on the street,'' state Corrections
Commissioner Thomas Coughlin said Wednesday after the ceremony.
   Coughlin told the new guards, who come from across New York,
that they'll lose their jobs the day after Christmas. That's when
they will have completed their four weeks of on-the-job training at
various state prisons.
   Under state contracts with their employees, it is required that
the newest employees are laid off first.
   The layoffs, from the $21,000-a-year rookie guard jobs, are part
of Gov. Mario Cuomo's plan to reduce a potential $1 billion budget
deficit this year with 2,000 state agency firings.
   In all, Coughlin has to lay off about 300 guards and 400
teachers and other civilian prison employees as part of the Cuomo
plan.
   ``These poor folks, through no fault of their own, got caught up
... in the cuts,'' Coughlin said. ``They had to go.''
   About 400 people, including family members of the new guards,
listened silently to the commissioner's comments at the start of
the ceremony, said Coughlin.
   ``There was so much anxiety in the room,'' Coughlin said of the
fact that last Saturday it was announced that 300 guards would be
laid off. ``They probably saw the handwriting on the wall.''
   There's a good chance the fired guards will be rehired as other
guards quit or retire and the state opens new prisons, Coughlin
said.

   Two Americans were among 38 people who
died in the crash of a Thai plane carrying foreign vacationers to a
resort island, the U.S. Embassy said Thursday.
   The Bangkok Airways plane slammed into coconut trees in heavy
rain and gusty wind late Wednesday as it prepared to land on Koh
Samui, police said. Witnesses said it exploded and then crashed
about six miles from the airport.
   Everyone aboard the plane, a de Havilland turbo-prop, was
killed, including the five crew members and 33 mostly foreign
passengers, officials said.
   The airport, with no radar or advanced ground control equipment,
opened only last year to draw more foreign tourists to the pristine
island in the Gulf of Thailand, 300 miles south of Bangkok.
   Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan ordered an investigation
into the crash and an inspection of safety conditions at Koh
Samui's airport, his spokesman Suvit Yodmani said.
   The flight recorder containing the conversation between the
plane and the aircraft was found Wednesday but not yet analyzed,
police said.
   The Bangkok Airways plane was on a 50-minute flight from Bangkok
when it crashed.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman James Williams said at least two
Americans were aboard - Edward G. Lincoln and Miss Kathleen
Lincoln. Williams said he had no other immediate information.
   The passengers also included four or five Japanese, two
Australians, and one German, said Nanthika Niyomrerk of the public
relations department of Bangkok Airways. There also may have been
Swedes and Finns aboard, she said.
   No other information on nationalities of victims was immediately
available.
   Passanee Thongsuk, a hotel receptionist, said she saw the plane
crash and explode about 6:20 p.m. Ms. Passanee said she was
watching the sky because her hotel was expecting some of the
tourists aboard the plane to check in.
   ``I saw the plane slowly heading down,'' she said. ``A few
seconds later, I saw a big fire and smoke ... There was a loud
explosion.''
   ``It came down between some houses nearthe main road,'' she
said. ``The people living there were very lucky to escape.''
   Dr. Suvit Nantapanich, the director of Samui Hospital, said the
bodies would be flown to Bangkok on Thursday.
   The plane was flying from Bangkok on the scenic 50-minute run to
the island.
   The aircraft was a de Havilland Dash 8 Series 100 plane, one of
two delivered to Bangkok Airways last year, said an aviation source
in Seattle, who is familiar with de Havilland operations.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the planes
are built in Toronto by de Havilland Canada, a Boeing subsidiary.
Boeing has its headquarters in Seattle.

<HEAD>New Clean Air Law May Provide Feast for Environmental Companies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   For five years David Sundstrom has tried to
sell utilities on a system that turns coal into cleaner-burning gas
and produces electricity with less pollution.
   Usually they would listen, he says, and ``then sit on their
hands.''
   No more.
   Utility executives now are seeking out Sundstrom's company,
Destec Energy Inc., and trekking in steady numbers to the Dow
Chemical Co. subsidiary's coal gasification demonstration plant in
Louisiana to learn more.
   ``There is now a line outside the door. There will be plenty of
business for Destec,'' says Charles Goff, the company's president.
Its one-man sales force is being expanded.
   The smiles at Destec - and at hundreds of environmental services
companies like it nationwide - stem from the 1990 Clean Air Act
signed into law by President Bush on Nov. 15, marking a new era in
air pollution controls.
   The tougher clean air requirements that will be phased in over
the next dozen years are expected to cost polluters - and their
customers - as much as $11 billion a year within five years and
more than $25 billion a year by the 2005. That's money that will be
going into someone else's pocketbook.
   Destec hopes to capture a large chunk of the money.
   So do low-sulfur coal producers, manufactures of auto emissions
equipment, builders of $100 million ``scrubbers'' for power plants,
designers of pollution monitoring gear, brokers in pollution
allowances and droves of lawyers and consultants needed to make
sense of the dozens of new government regulations yet to come.
   The Environmental Protection Agency also is hiring people to
help develop and implement the regulations.
   ``There are going to be an awful lot of people that will be big
winners,'' says Bruce Braine, a vice president of ICF Resources
Inc., an environmental consulting firm in Fairfax, Va.
   The new clean air law will require tougher emissions controls on
automobiles, force factories and thousands of businesses to install
new pollution control equipment, and require that electric
utilities cut in half releases of sulfur dioxide that cause acid
rain.
   Electric rate payers will see higher bills, especially in parts
of the Midwest; car prices likely will go up, as will gasoline and
possibly other products.
   The acid rain requirements will force utilities to buy expensive
pollution control equipment or shift away from high-sulfur coal.
   That has people smiling at the A.T. Massey Coal Co. in Richmond,
Va., the biggest producer of low-sulfur coal in the East, where
T-shirts have begun to sprout declaring: ``Massey Lite Coal: High
in BTUs, Low in Sulfur.''
   ``We're trying to give Massey an identity,'' says Jerry Eyster,
vice president for corporate development. He predicts competition
will still be keen with western low-sulfur coal producers.
   That's fine with the Burlington Northern Railroad, one of the
major shippers of low-sulfur coal out of Wyoming's Powder River
Basin. The railroad has begun test runs of coal shipments farther
East than normal and anticipates that the clean air requirements
will boost volume by 10 percent.
   A key and innovative part of the new law will allow utilities to
trade pollution allowances to ease the cost of compliance. That has
telephones ringing in the Washington office of AERX, a company that
specializes in such trades.
   ``Clearly we're going to be a winner,'' says John Palmisano,
president and founder of the firm. ``We're hiring. We look at 1991
as a good year and 1992 as a very good year.''
   The natural gas industry also sees dollar signs. Industrial
plants and electric utilities will eye the cleaner fuel, as will
fleet vehicle operators in the nation's smog-clogged cities.
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. in California hopes to capitalize with
plans to develop a network of outlets dispensing natural gas for
fleet vehicles and eventually private cars.
   At Tecogen Inc. in Waltham, Mass., the clean air bill means a
major marketing boost for a new engine that uses compressed natural
gas. The company already has an agreement to supply 10 of the
engines for school buses as part of a pilot program in California,
but now expects interest to jump.
   Ravinder Sakhuja, Tecogen's president, said the company is
expected to triple its revenue from the current $20 million a year
within four or five years because of new business.
   Companies like Allied-Signal Automotive Catalyst Co. in Tulsa,
Okla., also expect business to prosper as automakers will demand
more sophisticated emissions control equipment. ``The R&amp;D people,
the engineering people, those people are winners,'' said Jim Hiera,
the company's director of marketing.
   The required sale of cleaner-burning gasoline in cities with the
worst smog will increase gasoline costs in 1995. Some of the money
will go to Archer-Daniel-Midland Co., which produces ethanol, a
corn-based additive, as well as to farmers.
   NaTec Resources Inc. in Houston is pushing a process in which
baking soda would be used to chemically transform sulfur dioxide at
coal-burning power plants into sodium sulfate that can be used in
laundry detergent.
   Paul Portney, vice president of Resources for the Future, a
Washington-based environmental research group, says tens of
billions of dollars will be spent on cleaning up the nation's air
over the next 10 years to 15 years.
   ``There's no way to spend a dollar without it going to
somebody,'' he says.

<HEAD>Growing Opposition to Plan to Eject 7,000 Romanians From Austria</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite growing opposition to the plan,
this country that has traditionally sheltered East bloc refugees is
preparing to send home 7,000 Romanians in its largest forced
repatriation in decades.
   ``I cannot keep ... everyone happy,'' Interior Minister Franz
Loeschnak said Wednesday of the burgeoning criticism from
newspapers, politicians and the Roman Catholic Church.
   On Thursday, Protestant church leaders also announced their
opposition. About 80 people gathered this afternoon near an
anti-fascist memorial to peacefully protest the government plan.
   More than 11,000 Romanians have fled their troubled homeland
this year alone, by far the largest nationality among more than
18,000 asylum-seekers who have arrived in Austria in 1990.
   The government has refused to say when the first Romanians would
be ejected. But a source, who asked not to be more closely
identified, said the process was tentatively scheduled to begin
this month.
   About 60 Romanians who have been convicted of crimes in Austria
will be the first to go home, he said. Romanians whose asylum
requests had been refused and those without jobs or permanent
residence will also be forced to leave, Loeschnak told Austrian
radio.
   Loeschnak said that about 1,200 Romanian refugees had already
been singled out, and aides confirmed plans to send about 7,000
back once all the paperwork is completed.
   Most have been living in government-funded refugee camps or
rooms.
   Historians say the ejections would be the country's largest
since thousands of refugees were forcibly relocated after World War
II by the four victorious powers who occupied Austria until 1955.
   With the toppling of communist regimes in Eastern Europe, the
refugee issue has grown in importance in Austria, which offered
haven for decades to the politically persecuted from the other side
of the Iron Curtain.
   Hundreds of thousands of Hungarians were welcomed in 1956 after
Soviet tanks crushed their uprising; more than 100,000
Czechoslovaks gained free entry in 1968 following the Warsaw Pact
invasion of their country.
   No one was sent back against his will during the four decades of
communism in Eastern Europe.
   But sentiment has changed in the past year, as East Europeans
flood through newly opened borders - most to visit, some to stay.
   Romanians have been the target of most of the enmity. While most
other East Europeans appear content to visit and return home,
Romanians have continued to flee economic malaise and political
uncertainty unmatched in most of the other former Soviet bloc
nations.
   Of the 18,603 people who sought asylum up to September, 11,038
were Romanian, according to Interior Ministry figures. Turks were
the next largest group at 1,478.
   The influx has overwhelmed many Austrians used to a more quiet
life. Many now say that with the repressive communist regimes just
a memory, most of those seeking to stay in Austria only want a
higher standard of living.
   ``I'm afraid to go shopping on Mariahilferstrasse nowadays,''
said Jo Mestitz, an 84-year old widow who lives near the broad
shopping street in Vienna's sixth district. ``You're likely to get
overrun by Poles, and all you hear spoken is Czech or Hungarian.''
   Originally, only refugee aid organizations objected to the
government's plan. But by Wednesday, criticism had grown to include
political figures from the partners in the governing coalition and
Roman Catholic bishops, who have the ear of more than 80 percent of
the nation's 7.6 million people.
   ``Mass deportations of people have never been justified, because
each individual's fate is different from someone else's,'' said
Bishop Florian Kuntner, president of the Bishops' Commission for
Justice and Peace.
   State-owned Austrian Airlines announced it would not fly any
Romanian back home against his will, and it urged the Interior
Ministry to reconsider. Austrian radio said negotiations had been
started with Lauda Air, the nation's private international airline.
   Many newspapers denounced the plan in stinging editorials.
   ``It is bad that a minister of an Austrian government has
received such a task, and it is bad that he accepts it without
regard to human rights and humanity,'' said the Neue Zeit
newspaper.
   It indirectly compared the plan to the deportations of Jews to
the Auschwitz death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland during World War
II.
   But Interior Ministry spokesman Rainer Mayerhofer said most
Austrians supported the move.

<TEXT>
   A 13-year-old boy and his 11-year-old
brother decided to ask jurors in a federal trial how they thought
things were going for their dad, the defendant. The perplexed judge
was forced to declare a mistrial.
   The defense was about to begin its side Wednesday when the sons
of defendant Gunther Russbacher quizzed jurors entering the
courtroom, said Public Defender Mark Coleman.
   ``They didn't know any better,'' Coleman said. ``Adults
generally know better than to talk to the jury, but the boys
didn't.''
   Russbacher is accused of impersonating a Navy captain and a U.S.
attorney.
   Prosecutor Jon Conklin, who had completed his case, found the
forced mistrial a ``disappointment, very frustrating.''
   A juror told a court clerk about the boys' questions, and he
notified Judge Edward Dean Price. He told the attorneys he had no
choice but to declare a mistrial.
   A new trial will be scheduled later for Russbacher. He is
accused of requisitioning a government jet while pretending to be a
federal attorney, then flying to Seattle to get his girlfriend and
on to Reno where they were married. When arrested July 31,
Russbacher and his wife were staying at Castle Air Force Base where
he allegedly was pretending to be a Navy captain.

<HEAD>European Parliament Calls For Gladio Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STRASBOURG, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Parliament on Thursday
called for an investigation into the activities of secret
anti-communist organizations set up in the 1950s to counter a
possible Soviet invasion of Western Europe.
   In a resolution passed by a vote of 65-41 with 13 abstentions,
the Parliament Ealso asked the 12 EC governments to look into
possible links between the network of secret groups and right-wing
terrorism in Europe over the last two decades.
   The resolution urged the governments to undertake a ``full
investigation into the nature, structure, aims and all other
aspects of these clandestine organizations.''
   The network was organized by West European intelligence agencies
to carry out sabotage and surveillance in case of a Soviet
invasion.
   It involved hundreds of operatives with access to extensive
caches of weapons, according to recent disclosures by West European
officials.
   Some officials have suggested that the organization, called
``Gladio'' after its Italian code name, was involved in right-wing
terrorism during the 1970s, especially in Italy.
   The Parliament, the European Community's assembly, condemned the
network, which it said had ``escaped all democratic control.'' Some
government leaders said they knew nothing about the clandestine
groups in their countries.
   The Parliament called on EC governments to dismantle any
remaining ``clandestine military and paramilitary networks.''
   The assembly urged EC governments to examine the network's
``composition and modus operandi and to clarify any action they may
have taken to destabilize the democratic structures of the (EC)
member states.''
   The resolution singled out the United States for special
criticism, protesting ``vigorously'' against the efforts of U.S.
officials ``to encourage the establishment in Europe'' of such a
network.
   Some Christian Democrats in the Parliament voted against the
resolution to avoid criticizing members of their party in power in
many West European countries when such networks were set up.

   A 21-month-old boy died in his father's
arms after falling under a wheel of a tractor being driven by his
6-year-old sister, who regularly helped out on the family farm,
authorities reported.
   Matthew Dragt apparently was trying to get into the driver's
seat when he fell Wednesday, said his father, William Dragt, 32.
   ``He'd try once in a while to drive,'' he said. ``Apparently, he
decided he wanted to really drive, but he ended up on the ground
and it rolled over him.''
   Dragt told Tulare County sheriff's deputies that his daughter,
Rachel, often drove the tractor while he stood on a trailer tossing
hay to their cows.
   Dragt said he often had his three children - Matthew, Rachel and
4-year-old Daniel - with him while he did the chores on their dairy
farm 150 miles north of Los Angeles.
   ``They loved to be with me when I fed the cows; that was one of
their greatest things,'' Dragt said. ``My oldest girl usually
drives for me. She goes real slow.''

<TEXT>
   For almost a decade, Margaret Thatcher was
regarded at the White House as America's best friend, the trusted
ally whose strong views reinforced the conservative tone of
administration policies.
   Among Western allies, she was alone at Ronald Reagan's side in
1986 in supporting the U.S. bombing of Libya. In the Persian Gulf
crisis, she boldly joined with George Bush in sending troops to the
Middle East.
   ``You always know where she was and what she believed,'' Bush
said upon hearing of her decision to resign. ``She has always been
an outstanding ally of the United States,'' he said. ``I will miss
her.''
   There were many doubters around the world when Reagan arrived in
Washington with an economic program of free-market capitalism that
seemed out of step with the times. Mrs. Thatcher wasn't one of the
skeptics; she was advocating a similar program at home.
   They shared rocky relations with organized labor. Reagan
successfully fired the nation's air traffic controllers, dealing a
devastating blow to labor. She, too, smashed restive unions.
   On foreign policy, she frequently was more right wing than
Reagan - certainly more so than Bush.
   Reagan never made any secret of his special affection for the
British prime minister. They were ideological soulmates and called
each other Ronnie and Margaret. At international gatherings, they
usually were side by side.
   Two years ago as they met for the final time before Reagan left
office, the president said he was leaving the White House with
``considerable satisfaction in the knowledge that Margaret Thatcher
will still reside at No. 10 Downing Street.''
   She later wrote him a ``Dear Ron'' letter in which she praised
him as ``a great president, one of the greatest.''
   Like Reagan, she was deeply suspicious of the Soviet Union.
Together they advocated a hard line toward Moscow and championed
military readiness - even though she was the first to recognize
Mikhail S. Gorbachev as a leader she could do business with.
   Mrs. Thatcher encouraged the huge Pentagon buildup that Reagan
nurtured under the theme of peace through strength. She was a big
backer of U.S. efforts to install medium-range missiles in Europe
and always seemed cautious - perhaps reluctant - when it came to
disarmament.
   When Argentina and Britain clashed militarily over the Falkland
Islands, the United States was forced to make a painful choice
between two allies. Ronnie sided with Margaret.
   Washington's special relationship with London seemed to slip
when Reagan left power. Bush and Mrs. Thatcher disagreed publicly
last year over her government's decision to deport Vietnamese and
Cambodian ``boat people'' who were fleeing their countries to Hong
Kong.
   Bush, a veteran of world politics, knew many leaders around the
globe. Mrs. Thatcher suddenly seemed to be just one of the gang.
   The Berlin Wall was collapsing and it appeared as if Bush found
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl more interesting than Mrs. Thatcher.
She was merely one in a parade of foreign dignitaries who got the
prized invitation to visit Bush at Camp David this year.
   Nevertheless, Bush said he expected the ``special relationship''
between the United States and Great Britain to remain on a ``steady
keel.''
   Mrs. Thatcher did her part, demonstrating her loyalty. For
awhile she and Bush were seemingly alone in their suspicions of
Gorbachev's unilateral cutbacks in troops and arms in Europe, and
appeared uncertain how to respond.
   Under intense pressure from Congress, Bush began to warm to the
Soviet leader. Now they seem almost best of friends.
   On the Persian Gulf, Bush said he would not rule out possible
military force, and ordered a huge buildup of troops to make his
threat credible. Mrs. Thatcher, characteristically, was tougher.
   She said that unless Saddam Hussein got out of Kuwait soon, the
West would have to use military force to dislodge him.
   She called Saddam ``a loser,'' and the state-controlled Iraqi
news agency replied that she was an ``old hag.''
   Now, she is leaving. No one suspects that Britain's new
leadership - whoever it is - will take a soft line toward Iraq.
Yet, if the going gets tough, it might have been comforting for
Bush to be able to hear the tough old line from Thatcher.

   On the streets of central London, Britons were
suprised and even shocked at Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
abrupt resignation Thursday.
   Some people cheered and some were saddened.
   But young or old, male or female, white collar or blue, nearly
everyone expressed surprise that the woman who is as much a British
institution as the corner pub was suddenly gone.
   ``It was quite a shock, I suppose. I didn't think she would
quit. All I could think when I saw the newswoman announcing it on
TV this morning was that this was truly a historic day,'' said
Christine Scott, 49, a school administrator on her way to lunch on
Fleet Street.
   The prime minister's resignation filled radio and TV airwaves
throughout the day, but many people first heard the news on their
way to work.
   ``I was on the elevator in the Hampstead tube station when a
woman came dashing on and said, `That's it, Maggie's gone, she
resigned,' and everyone cheered. They also read an announcement on
the loudspeaker in the underground,'' said Elizabeth Gore, acting
head of the language department at the City Literary University in
Bolton Court.
   Bus company inspectors hopped on the city's red double-decker
buses to announce the resignation. The pilot of a British Airways
flight from Paris to London relayed the news from the control tower
at Heathrow Airport to passengers.
   ``I'm very sad,'' said Sonya Davis, a manager at British
Telecom, waiting for a friend outside the Temple tube station. ``At
least she knew what she was doing. ... I thought she'd stay for a
fight. It's a bit daunting to know she has given up.''
   Some people worried that without Mrs. Thatcher no one was
guiding the ship of state through the turbulent waters of the
Persian Gulf.
   ``The only person happy today is Saddam Hussein,'' said Charles
Lord, a 60-year-old clerk at the Bank of England.
   Behind the Old Bailey, several young lawyers said they were more
than ready for a change.
   ``I'm very pleased. It's great, somebody else will now have a
chance and that's very good for the country,'' said Angus Charlton,
a 25-year-old lawyer in a Savile Row suit. ``Now the Tories have to
reunify, to paper over the cracks that this leadership fight has
created.''
   Many of those happy to see her go, expressed a tinge of regret.
   ``It's a shame really, because she did lots of good things,''
said Michael Davies, a 27-year-old taxi driver. ``But in the last
couple of years she has just gone too far.''
   Davies, like many other people, listed the poll tax as a major
cause of Mrs. Thatcher's decline in popular support.
   ``There's no way to alienate a person faster than taking money
out of his pocket,'' Davies said. ``There's the poll tax, that's
what will kill the Tories. She also dismantled the national health
so I now have to buy private health insurance.
   ``Between one thing and another, she has cost me a couple of
thousand quid (pounds) this year and that's a lot of money for a
working person.''
   The poll tax replaces a tax on property owners and is paid by
every adult.
   Davies said he liked Michael Heseltine, the former defense
minister who challenged Mrs. Thatcher for the party leadership and
garnered enough support on Tuesday to precipitate her resignation.
   None of the dozen people interviewed expressed much liking for
the two men who entered the race after Mrs. Thatcher resigned -
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd or Chancellor of the Exchequer John
Major.
   ``One of the things I liked about Maggie was that you felt she
could cope with anyone and anything in the world. She could stand
up to anybody,'' said Mrs. Scott.
   ``I don't feel that way about any of the others. Now that she's
gone, where do we find a leader?''
   Claude Musselwhite, a retired businessman walking near
Westminster Abbey, said that while he felt sad, ``it was probably
time. Still, there has never been anyone like her and there may
never be again.''

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House of Deputies has approved issuance of
a new currency to replace the ``inti'' introduced almost six years
ago.
   The bill approving the creation of the ``nuevo sol'' will now be
presented before the Senate, which is expected to approve the
project. One nuevo sol will equal one million intis.
   The new currency is expected to be issued in January. It takes
its name from the ``sol,'' the currency in circulation at the time
the inti was first issued.
   At present, about 440,000 intis are needed to buy a dollar. When
first introduced, it took about 6 intis to purchase a dollar.
   Since taking office July 28, President Alberto Fujimori has
imposed harsh measures aimed at eliminating hyperinflation, which
has run at nearly 10,000 percent over the past 12 months.
   Monthly inflation in October fell below 10 percent.

   The State Department cautioned U.S. citizens
on Thursday to postpone non-essential travel to Sudan, where large
demonstrations against the United States and in favor of Iraq have
taken place.
   ``Although these demonstrations were orderly and kept under
control by government security forces, the situation could change
quickly,'' the department said.
   The department said it has authorized voluntary departure of
dependents of U.S. government personnel in Khartoum, the Sudanese
capital.
   ``Private citizens whose presence is not essential should
consider leaving as well,'' the department said.

   A total of 279 Iraqi prisoners of war
released by Iran arrived in Baghdad on Thursday, the official Iraqi
News Agency reported.
   Their arrival followed the release by Iraq and return to Tehran
the previous day of 238 Iranian POWs.
   This was the first exchange between the two countries in nearly
two months.
   The exchanges started in mid-August after Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein abruptly agreed to all Iran's conditions for a peace treaty
to formally end the 1980-88 war between them.
   He was apparently seeking peace on his eastern border while
trying to consolidate his hold on the oil-rich Arab emirate of
Kuwait, which he invaded on Aug. 2.
   The prisoner exchanges were suspended by Iraq without
explanation Sept. 20, after 37,000 men had been repatriated. The
International Committee of the Red Cross said 25,000 men remained
interned, without giving a breakdown.
   The exchange started again following last week's visit to
Baghdad by Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati. He was the
highest Iranian official to visit Iraq since Iran's 1979 Islamic
revolution.

<HEAD>Iraq Determined To Be Nuclear Power - Question Is When</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq is on a crash program to become the first
Arab state to have nuclear weapons, but experts differ on how close
the Iraqi arsenal is to being ready.
   President Bush told U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia Thursday their
mission was marked by ``a real sense of urgency'' because of
President Saddam Hussein's progress in acquiring nuclear arms. But,
he added, ``No one knows precisely'' how near Iraq is to becoming a
nuclear power.
   Some analysts in Israel, which tracks the Iraqi program very
closely, estimate Saddam is two to five years away from producing
atomic warheads for his extensive missile stockpiles or building a
nuclear bomb he can drop from a fighter jet.
   Other experts put the timetable at 10 years away, especially if
the program has been set back because of the international trade
embargo against Iraq.
   ``Iraq could have a nuclear weapons production capability within
10 years,'' said Mike Eisenstadt, author of a report on Iraq's
nuclear, chemical and biological capabilities issued recently by
the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
   ``If it receives help from abroad ... it could be producing
nuclear weapons within as little as five years,'' said Eisenstadt,
who also serves as a civilian analyst for U.S. Army Intelligence.
   The Iraqi program got its start with help from France, which
sold two nuclear reactors to Baghdad in 1976 for the production of
electricity.
   But Israel, citing intelligence information, said Iraq was using
the reactors to produce nuclear weapons with the help of 150 pounds
of enriched uranium supplied by France.
   The substance is essential for exploding nuclear weapons, and
Israel has reportedly obtained sufficient amounts to produce its
own nuclear arsenal.
   In 1981, Israeli fighter planes bombed the Iraqi nuclear
facility outside Baghdad. Israel drew international condemnation,
but the Iraqi program was brought to a standstill.
   The enriched uranium that was left over from the French shipment
- estimated at about 27 pounds - was placed under the safeguards
program of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of which Iraq is a
signatory.
   That means inspectors from the Vienna-based International Atomic
Energy Agency periodically inspect the material to make sure Iraq
isn't diverting it for weapons production.
   The next inspection is scheduled next week, and although the
results generally remain classified, U.S. experts have said Iraq's
willingness to allow the inspection indicates it has not diverted
the material.
   Nonetheless, State Department officials say Iraq could have
acquired other uranium which is not under the inspection program.
   In the late 1970s and early 1980s, according to Eisenstadt's
report, Iraq acquired 250 tons of uranium ore concentrate from
Brazil, Portugal and Niger. This material is not weapons-grade but
could have been used to extract plutonium - another essential
component in a nuclear weapon, said Eisenstadt.
   In 1987, Iraq revived its nuclear program, experts say.
   Rather than rebuilding the bombed reactor, Iraq decided to
acquire a gas centrifuge device for enriching uranium, according to
experts and press reports. Brazil and Pakistan, both burgeoning
nuclear powers, have reportedly used this method successfully but
it took each of them about a decade to have operational
centrifuges.
   Iraq could use the uranium ore concentrate, which is not subject
to IAEA inspection, to power the centrifuge which produces enriched
uranium, experts say.
   Work on the Iraqi project is reportedly being conducted at the
Saad 16 facility near the city of Mosul, at another site in a
mountain near Irbil, and at the Tuwaitha nuclear center outside
Baghdad.
   West German firms, taking advantage of their country's formerly
loose export restriction laws, were instrumental in helping Iraq's
gas centrifuge project. So were China, Pakistan, and -
inadvertently - several American and British firms.
   Last year, U.S. customs agents seized vacuum pumps bound for
Iraq from a Rochester, N.Y. company, saying the Iraqis could have
used them in their nuclear program.
   British customs agents, acting on a tip from U.S. officials,
earlier this year seized a shipment of krytons to Iraq. Krytons are
used to detonate nuclear weapons.
   After the seizure, Saddam announced his country could produce
the devices on its own.
   In addition to the concentrate uranium, known as yellowcake,
Iraq may also be trying to extract the metal from a mine in the
northern part of the country.
   Recent Soviet satellite pictures have found an industrial
operation, including new roads and two excavation sites, in the
Gara mountains, 40 miles south of the Turkish border, according to
the respected Jane's Defense Weekly.

<TEXT>
   Christmas tree growers are trying to
capitalize on America's newfound environmental awareness, touting
their evergreens as the responsible alternative to plastic
``petrochemical trees.''
   ``Real trees are recyclable; they're biodegradable,'' said
Jeanne Weiss, assistant director of public relations for the
National Christmas Tree Association in Milwaukee.
   Plastic trees ``are made out of oil byproducts,'' Weiss said
Tuesday.
   On the other hand, some environmentalists point out that
chemicals often are used on real trees, and that plastic trees at
least are reusable.
   Artificial trees for several years have held a steady 50 percent
share of the holiday market. Even so, Weiss forecasts shoppers will
buy 36 million cut Christmas trees this season - a $341 million
business for wholesalers.
   Michigan, the nation's largest commercial tree producer, will
cut about 7 million trees this year.
   In 1988, the national Christmas tree growers group put $1
million into a television advertising campaign playing on the
nostalgic charm of cut trees. This year, Weiss said, ``with all
that publicity about Earth Day, we thought that should carry over
to Christmas.''
   The environmental tactic is part defense. Weiss said she often
sees comments such as: ``buy an artificial tree and save a real
tree.''
   ``That is not what we want to see,'' said Weiss.
   The association has an armory of Christmas tree trivia for its
campaign:
   -For every tree cut, three are planted, most on land where other
crops fail.
   -Most trees sold in the United States are grown here while
artificial trees come from places like Hong Kong or Taiwan.
   -The nation's approximately 1 million acres of Christmas trees
supply enough oxygen for 18 million people. Those trees also absorb
carbon dioxide, one of the gases warming the Earth through the
``greenhouse effect.''
   But a real Christmas tree doesn't necessarily mean an
environmentally safe tree, said Jane Elder, Midwest representative
for the Sierra Club in Madison, Wis.
   She said Christmas tree buyers should be aware that most live
trees are sprayed with a variety of chemicals, even paint.
   ``There are questions they should ask: Was it grown with
herbicides or pesticides or sprayed with dyes or other chemical
additives that will add to the pollution stream? ... You get into
the question of is it worth it for a tree that is just slightly
more emerald green,'' she said.
   Buyers should also consider how they'll dispose of the tree,
Elder said.
   ``If you are going to buy a petrochemical Christmas tree and
keep it for your lifetime and pass it down to your grandchildren,
then I suppose that, too, is environmentally sound,'' she said.
   Pesticides and other chemicals are as much a part of the
Christmas tree industry as other agricultural products, said
Michael Gabrione, general manager of M. Walter Christmas Trees,
Inc., in Chicago. The company has Christmas tree farms from
Michigan to Nova Scotia and ships trees across the country.
   ``If we have to have totally organic Christmas trees, everybody
in the Christmas tree industry is going to be in big trouble,''
Gabrione said. ``People aren't going to get the same kind of
product they are used to.''
   Walter Christmas Trees follows industry practice and paints its
Scotch pines green. Otherwise, the trees would have a yellowish
cast and, Gabrione said, ``people expect a Christmas-tree green
color.''
   The paint also helps the tree retain moisture after it's cut.
   Weiss couldn't say what chemicals are commonly used by Christmas
tree growers. Neither could Laurie Dornbush, executive director of
the Michigan Christmas Tree Association.
   ``It's something we want to look at,'' Dornbush said Tuesday
from her office in Okemos.
   She's interested in finding out what kind of chemical residues
are left on trees by the time they wind up in living rooms or as
garden mulch.

   Suspected Sikh gunmen on Thursday
ambushed three buses, killing at least 16 people in the attacks
outside the capital of Punjab state, news agencies reported.
   United News of India said the attacks took place near Paroll
village outside Chandigarh, 150 miles north of New Delhi.
   The United News of India said state police chief K.P.S. Gill
confirmed 16 deaths. Several people were injured, Gill was quoted
as saying.
   Another news agency, Press Trust of India, quoted unnamed police
sources as saying that 25 people were killed. PTI said militants
forced passengers ``of a particular community'' to get off the
buses and killed them. The phrasing indicated the victims were
Hindus.
   Indian news media do not identify the religion of the victims in
such attacks believing that it will exacerbate communal tensions.
   The reports said Gill had rushed to the site and details were
not immediately available.
   Thursday's attack was the latest in a series of mass killings by
Sikh extremists who are fighting to set up an independent nation in
the northern state, a rich farming area bordering Pakistan.
   In the last major attack, Sikh gunmen killed 13 people Tuesday
evening in a crowded market in Amritsar, the holy Sikh city and the
center of the separatist campaign.
   At least 170 people have died in Punjab in the last 10 days in
militant attacks. Victims have included bus passengers, people
doing morning exercise, farmers and members of security forces.
   United News of India said 11 other people were killed by Sikh
extremists in the state Thursday in separate incidents. It did not
give details.
   More than 2,900 people have been killed in Punjab this year by
the militants who have been waging the insurrection since 1982,
complaining their community is disriminated against by the
Hindu-dominated government.
   Sikhs are in a slight majority in Punjab but nationwide form
only 2 percent of India's 880 million people. Hindus comprise 82
percent.

<TEXT>
   A band of white and black
rebel army troops mounted a failed coup attempt today in the black
homeland of Transkei and 17 people died in the fighting with
loyalist forces, reports said.
   Military ruler Maj. Gen. Bantu Holomisa told a rally late
Thursday in Transkei's capital, Umtata, that the coup attempt had
been put down, the independent South African Press Association
reported. Holomisa said the leader of the uprising, former Holomisa
aide Craig Duli, was dead, the agency said.
   There was no independent confirmation of the report. Telephone
lines to Transkei were cut later in the afternoon and there was no
answer at the Transkei Embassy in Pretoria.
   Holomisa said the coup attempt was headed by Duli, a former
member of the military council, and involved about six whites and a
handful of black troops. Duli is black and had been Holomisa's
chief of military intelligence.
   Holomisa, whose government has ties with the anti-apartheid
African National Congress, said earlier that he suspected the South
African government might have been involved in the coup attempt.
   South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha denied any South
African effort to topple the government in the homeland of 2.75
million people, which covers three areas scattered in southeastern
South Africa.
   Homomisa said in addition to Duli, 11 co-conspirators died in
battles with government soldiers who surrounded the building in
Umtata where the rebels had taken refuge. The press agency said
five government soldiers were also killed.
   Earlier, South African diplomats in Umtata said fighting broke
out about dawn when the rebels tried to seize key government
buildings in the city. Umtata is about 370 miles south of
Johannesburg.
   The Press Association said it appeared fighting began at an army
base on the outskirts of Umtata and the rebels later attempted to
seize government buildings in the city.
   ``Early this morning, there were shots that were heard in parts
of Umtata,'' said South African diplomat Gert Terblanche, reached
by telephone in Umtata. Diplomats said roadblocks were put up
across the city.
   Local journalists said there was scattered gunfire and a number
of government soldiers were taken to hospitals.
   South African press reports said the airport at Umtata came
under heavy mortar fire. Terrified civilians tried to leave parts
of Umtata to escape fighting, according to reports from Transkei.
   Holomisa and the army seized power in Transkei in 1987 and set
up a government that has ties with the ANC, the main black
opposition group in South Africa.
   Duli helped Holomisa seized power, but the two had a falling out
later and Duli had been imprisoned until recently on charges of
possessing weapons. The Transkei military had a few white officers
when it was set up.
   It is one of four nominally independent black homelands set up
by the South Afican government in the 1970s and 1980s as part of a
plan to create separate states for blacks under the apartheid
system of racial separation.
   No country other than South Africa recognizes the independent
homelands, most of which have been pressing for reintegration into
South Africa.

<TEXT>
   The Hollywood High School marching band, once
so bad the chamber of commerce banned it from playing in the
Hollywood Christmas Parade, returns this year with snappy new
uniforms and renewed spirit.
   On Sunday, the band will join other bands, floats and performers
in the 1990 parade after an eight-year absence.
   It has been a long road back to respectability for the band,
which at one point lacked enough members to form the ``H'' in
Hollywood.
   ``This is going to be our crowning glory,'' said band director
Joe Montgomery. ``Two years ago, we had seven people.''
   The band now boasts 99 members, although only 50 will
participate in the parade. For all its progress, the band has only
enough red-white-and-silver uniforms to outfit half of its members.
   The band has not played in the parade since 1982. The Hollywood
Chamber of Commerce, which sponsors the event, said the band failed
to measure up to parade standards.
   The school's exclusion from the parade had been a source of
embarrassment. For decades, the band traditionally led the parade.
   Eighty percent of Hollywood High's 2,000 students are immigrants
who struggle with English and work after school to help support
their families.
   ``They had so many ethnic groups, no one wanted to play an
instrument. ... All they wanted to do was study,'' said parade
chairman John Golden.
   Montgomery was undaunted by the diversity and language barriers
when he took over as director three years ago. He quickly began
recruiting musicians.
   Among those marching in the parade Sunday will be a Chinese
trumpet player, a Vietnamese drummer, a Hungarian drum majorette,
an Armenian bell player and a Salvadoran saxophonist.
   Montgomery said the band has no intention of resting on its
laurels.
   ``Next year,'' he said, ``we would like to lead the parade.''

<HEAD>Official Says Food For Soviets Available But Shouldn't Be Needed

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There is no evidence of widespread hunger in
the Soviet Union, one of the world's biggest grain growers, and a
food aid program shouldn't be necessary this year, U.S. officials
say.
   ``They produce an awful lot of meat and potatoes,'' one analyst
said.
   Germany already has pledged food aid to the Soviets, and
President Bush said in Paris this week he ``would want to try to
help...if there's a real need there.'' Canada, Italy and Spain all
have extended bank credits and in some cases pledges of other
assistance to help the beleaguered Gorbachev government.
   The United States and other Western countries may join forces to
feed the Soviet people if starvation appears imminent, but U.S.
specialists in Soviet agriculture, economic and political affairs
said in interviews this week there is no evidence at this point of
genuine need.
   ``Food aid shouldn't be necessary this year,'' said one highly
placed State Department official, who discussed the situation on
condition he not be identified. ``The countryside appears to have
food. The agricultural regions of the Soviet Union and the cities
in those regions appear to have food. Moscow and Leningrad, while
obviously not an overflowing cornucopia, have food.''
   The grain harvest was exceptionally good this year, milk
production is at record levels and meat could exceed last year's
levels. Potato output is down, but not to a critical point.
   ``There is a problem for those on fixed incomes who cannot
supplement their diets by shopping every so often at the rinok,''
or private farmers' market, the official said. ``But basically,
even those people are getting along. We don't have any evidence of
significant or widespread hunger, imminent starvation or anything
like that.''
   John Hardt, a Soviet affairs analyst with the Library of
Congress, said the key to any assistance program should be setting
conditions and imposing discipline to ensure that the Soviets
implement the transition to a market system that Gorbachev has
promised.
   Experts say the Soviet Union alone can solve the main problem, a
distribution system unable to deliver food to those in need.
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher likened a Soviet aid
program to pouring money down a hole.
   ``Clearly, it's mostly a political consideration, not a
nutritional or an economic consideration,'' one U.S. source said.
``The Germans offering food aid put some pressure on the rest of us
to show the same kind of concern, but it's exasperating because
it's their (the Soviets') problem to solve, and they're not taking
the necessary steps.''
   The U.S. administration's political concerns were evident in
Bush's remarks in Paris, where he joined Gorbachev and the leaders
of 32 other nations to formally put an end to the Cold War.
   ``We would always be open-minded on humanitarian aid if there's
a real need there,'' the American president said, adding: ``We want
to try to help with the evolution of market systems and the
evolution - the change that's taking place. And you also want to
help new friends when you find them, if they're in jeopardy.''
   U.S. officials expect critical shortages to show up first in
heavily industrialized cities in the Urals, where food production
was actively discouraged for decades, and in the Far North, where
farming is limited by the frigid climate. Those areas, as well as
the largest and once-privileged cities of Moscow and Leningrad, are
most dependent on a distribution system that, notoriously wasteful
in the best of times, is now collapsing.
   Collective and state farms and authorities in agricultural
regions simply refuse to honor state-imposed contracts that require
them to sell a certain amount of their products to the All-Union
Fund for distribution to other parts of the country.
   The Soviets did increase wholesale food prices in September and
October in an attempt to restock the All-Union Fund and provide
commodities for the cities. U.S. observers say the move had some
impact but was offset by the precipitous decline in the value of
the ruble and the determination of farms and local officials to
horde products for themselves or trade them directly for consumer
goods.
   As a result, Moscow, which under the old system always enjoyed
the best of what was available because it was the center of
political power and influence, is now in worse shape than many
other areas.
   But an experienced State Department official said, ``I
personally find it difficult to believe the American taxpayer would
support substantial amounts of food assistance to a country that
just had the greatest bumper crop in history and which exports food
to other countries unless there's really starvation.''
   The Soviet Union not only sells some food abroad, the official
noted, but gives food relief aid to Ethiopia.
   Asked if a relief program would serve the secondary goal of
shoring up the Gorbachev government, the official said, ``If it
comes to providing U.S. assistance, it will be when things have
reached a dire state of affairs, and in that situation, it's
difficult to believe there will still be much of a Soviet
government left to worry about.''
   In 1921, when famine and civil war swept the fledgling communist
state, the United States launched an ambitious program to relieve
the disaster that eventually killed an estimated 3 million people.
   ``We ran soup kitchens, we had an elaborate distribution scheme,
we took food in trucks, in donkey carts, in horse-drawn carts, dog
sleds, whatever it took to reach starving people,'' the official
said. ``We might not do something that elaborate this time, but we
should take steps to make sure the food gets to the people who
really need it.''

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III was
rebuffed Thursday in efforts to get Yemen, the only Arab nation on
the U.N. Security Council, to support a resolution authorizing the
use of force to oust Iraq from Kuwait.
   Yemen's president, Gen. Ali Abdullah Saleh, standing next to
Baker, criticized the military buildup in the region and called for
an Arab solution to the crisis.
   ``Of course, we don't support the presence of foreign forces in
the region,'' he said at the end of two hours of talks with Baker
at his residence in the Yemeni capital of San'a.
   Saleh said the foreign troops have ``complicated the problem,
rather than solved it.''
   Baker was the highest ranking American official to visit Yemen
since President Bush made a trip in 1986 when he was vice
president.
   He flew to San'a from Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, where Bush was
spending Thanksgiving with some of the 230,000 American servicemen
in the region.
   Yemen, a poor country on the southwestern tip of the Arabian
peninsula, has gained prominence in the gulf crisis because of its
current seat on the U.N. Security Council.
   In December, it will assume the council's presidency, now held
by the United States.
   Any resolution giving advance authority to use military force
against Iraq would have to be approved by the 15-nation Security
Council.
   Saleh, when asked whether he would support such a statement, was
interrupted by his foreign minister, Abdul-Karim al-Iryani, who
said, ``There is no resolution.''
   A State Department official, asked later about the Yemeni
position, replied, ``They didn't say no.''
   Yemen has abstained from voting on five of the 10 resolutions
passed by the Security Council against Iraq since its Aug. 2
invasion of neighboring Kuwait.
   Baker said both governments prefer a peaceful end to the crisis.
But, he said, ``we find some differences of opinion as to what the
best method of achieving a peaceful political solution ( would
be).''
   Later, the State Department official, demanding anonymity, said
Baker was ``not disappointed or discouraged by the visit.''
   `We knew it was going to be a very tough nut,'' the official
said.
   Baker, in response to questions from local reporters, said the
United States wanted to bring its troops home as soon as possible.
   But, he said, Saddam was a brutal dictator who wanted to develop
a nuclear weapons capability. ``This man must be stopped.''
   The State Department official also said Baker has raised with
Saudi officials concerns about the recent expulsion of hundreds of
thousands of Yemeni workers from the kingdom.
   Saudi Arabia, apparently angered by Yemen's sympathy for Iraq,
has cancelled special privileges for Yemeni workers and traders,
forcing them to have a Saudi sponsor to do business in the country.
No such requirement previously existed.
   Before starting his talks, Baker took an hour-long stroll
through the Old City of San'a, a tangle of narrow streets dating
back 2,500 years. Hundreds of Yemenis, many wearing a traditional
dagger strapped to their waists, pushed in the crowded market area
to get a glimpse of him.
   Friendly merchants offered Baker a taste of the raisins, nuts,
coffee and other food displayed for buyers.
   Baker, who was escorted by Iryani, even rubbed his fingers on
the green leaves of qat, a mild narcotic that local residents
sometimes chew to induce euphoria.
   After his talks, Baker returned to Jiddah where he was to meet
with Saudi officials on Friday.
   Efforts to arrange a meeting with Malaysian officials while in
the region fell through. Malaysia also is a member of the Security
Council.
   He will travel next to Bogota, Colombia, to meet with President
Cesar Gaviria. Colombia is another council member.

   Mongolia's Communist Party on Thursday elected a
new slate of leaders for the third time in less than a year,
reflecting fast-paced political changes in the Soviet-bloc nation.
   The party also reaffirmed Mongolia's close ties to the Soviet
Union and warned that anti-Soviet sentiment, now openly and widely
expressed, is not in Mongolia's own best interests, China's
official Xinhua News Agency reported.
   ``Mistakes in the past should not be exploited as excuses for
opposing good-neighborly relations with the great neighbor (and)
publishing various slanders against the Soviet Union,'' Xinhua
paraphrased the Mongolian party as saying in a statement.
   Xinhua filed its dispatch from the Mongolian capital of Ulan
Bator, where the Mongolian party's Central Committee has been
meeting. The party's formal name is the Mongolian People's
Revolutionary Party.
   Mongolia is sandwiched between the Soviet Union and China.
   Xinhua said the Central Committee appointed five new members to
the party's six-seat top body, the Presidium. It first removed
three Presidium members for unspecified work-related reasons, while
a fourth, N. Michigdorg, already had resigned to become ambassador
to Moscow.
   Xinhua did not mention the two other members of the old
Presidium, party chairman Gombojavyn Ochirbat and L. Tudev,
director of the party newspaper Unen. They apparently retained
their seats, pushing the Presidium size to seven members.
   The Presidium, formerly known as the Politburo, sets basic
policy for the party, which has ruled Mongolia for nearly seven
decades.
   It ruled by terror for much of that time, but allowed multiparty
elections in July for the first time ever and won a majority in the
legislature. New opposition parties also made a strong showing and
now fill several key government posts.
   Mongolia's dramatic changes began in March, when the party bowed
to months of popular demonstrations. It appointed a new party
leadership, headed by Ochirbat, and renounced its monopoly on
power. A second shuffle was made a month later, when the party
replaced most of its Central Committee with younger, pro-reform
members.
   The new appointments continue the trend. The oldest of the five
is Budragchagyn Dashyonden, 44, the party secretary for Ulan Bator
city.
   Earlier in the party Central Committee session, Ochirbat
acknowledged that Mongolia's economic situation is worsening,
Xinhua reported. Production has dropped while prices and
unemployment have risen, it said.
   One reason for Mongolia's economic woes is a sharp reduction in
Soviet financial aid and trade as Moscow tries to grapple with its
own serious economic problems.
   Many Mongolians blame Moscow in part for the economy's basic
weaknesses, including a weak manufacturing base. For decades,
Mongolia exported raw materials to the Soviet Union in return for
finished products.
   The example of Soviet glasnost helped accelerate Mongolia's
movement toward democracy, and ironically made it possible for the
first time for Mongolians to openly express their resentment of
Soviet economic, military, political and cultural dominance.

   A small dent was discovered in the
trans-Alaska pipeline during an investigation of allegedly shoddy
inspection work, officials said.
   But the reinspection of pipeline sections originally tested for
corrosion and cracking by Thorpe Technical Service has turned up
nothing that implicates Thorpe, said Alyeska Pipeline Service Co.
spokeswoman Marnie Isaacs on Wednesday.
   Alyeska officials, not Thorpe workers, were responsible for
making visual inspections of the pipe for flaws like the dent,
Isaacs said.
   Fired Thorpe employee Edward Thompson prompted the investigation
more than a month ago by alleging that he and other workers were
untrained and pipeline flaws were covered up. Plans to boost the
pipeline's flow have been put off until the investigation is
complete.
   The dent, less than an inch across, will be repaired next week,
Alyeska officials said.

   A woman reservist broke into
tears saying grace at Thanksgiving dinner and recalling loved ones
at home. A tough sergeant said the holiday meant nothing without
his family.
   A truck-load of soldiers, spotting reporters at an air base just
after President Bush left, shouted: ``Why are we over here? This
ain't our war. Send us home.''
   In the desert of Saudi Arabia, there was a serious American
malady this Thanksgiving: homesickness.
   There were no complaints about the turkey, stuffing, sweet
potatoes or pie but it wasn't mom's or grandma's, and it had to be
chowed down in about 30 minutes maximum so another of the 230,000
American troops in the Persian Gulf could get a seat at the table.
   ``I'm very homesick right now,'' said Pfc. Tracey Jackman, 19,
of Corry, Pa., as she helped put up orange Thanksgiving decorations
and remembered wintery holidays past with her parents. Minutes
later, she burst into tears.
   ``Get this meal over with - I'll feel a lot better!'' shouted
Sgt. Donald W. Engelhardt, 31, of Ft. Bragg, N.C., an Army cook
with the 25th Signals Battalion who was carrying whole turkeys from
the kitchen to the dining room to be used for decoration.
   ``Thanksgiving don't mean nothing to me because I don't have my
loved ones with me,'' he said. ``If you weren't putting out so much
for a meal, you wouldn't feel so bad. I'm very homesick.''
   Sgt. Donna Hogg, 32, of Beverly Hills, Calif., who was the nanny
for television personality Ed McMahon when her National Guard unit
got called up, broke down as she said grace at a table with five
fellow reservists.
   ``We miss our families. We wish we could be with them,'' she
said, her voice cracking with emotion, ``...and we hope that they
are as blessed as we are today.''
   Her unit, the 1113th Transportation Co., from Sacramento,
California, had all spent a near-sleepless week getting the
ingredients for Thanksgiving dinner to military kitchens across the
country.
   ``It's a lot more work - that's about it,'' said Spec. Clint
Myers, 19, of Duncan, Oklahoma, who was chopping lettuce for
Thanksgiving salad in a tent at a desert field kitchen, and
thinking about happier holidays watching football games with his
grandfather.
   The soldiers in the truck who shouted at reporters near the base
that they wanted to go home were voicing the widespread sentiment
of many troops who missed seeing Bush during his seven-hour
whirlwind visit.
   ``He sent us all over here,'' said Sgt. Engelhardt. ``If we're
going to go to war, let's go to war. If we're going to go home,
let's go home.''
   Sgt. Hogg said: ``We shouldn't be here. I figured we agreed to
defend our country, not to go defend oil and all that stuff. That's
ridiculous.''
   Army Sgt. Cedric D. Clay, 32, a food service officer with the
Army's 80th Ordinance Division, whose wife in Tacoma, Wash., is
expecting their first child any day now, said he hoped the
confrontation with Iraq could be settled without bloodshed.
   ``There's too many gung-hos out there,'' he said. ``A life is
something very precious. I just hope this thing gets settled really
fast because this is a dangerous situation.''
   The U.S. military got high marks for trying to bring
Thanksgiving to the desert, and make servicemen feel close to home,
even if they didn't always succeed.
   Sgt. Lacey Santee, 25, of Sacramento, Calif., said the troops
should look at every holiday as special, no matter where they are.
   ``You've just got to think your family is going to be with you
no matter where you're at. That's how I think of it,'' she said.
``I figure if I'm eating this now, they're eating at the same time,
or somewhere around there, they're having a turkey dinner, so it's
like I'm almost with them. So that makes it a lot better.''

   U.S. Marines sang ``America'' and
bowed their hatless heads in silent prayer Thursday before tasting
their Thanksgiving turkey among the lengthening shadows in the
Saudi desert.
   Clusters of men from Headquarters and Service Co. of the 1st
Battalion, 5th Infantry Regiment, stacked their weapons and ate
their supper sitting in the sand shaded by their HUMVEE trucks and
military vehicles.
   They consumed their special meal without presidential fanfare,
without football and without the company of loved ones thousands of
miles away. But they gave thanks just the same.
   ``We got to be thankful we haven't gone to war yet, and we pray
there's a peaceful solution to all this,'' said Lance Cpl. Steve
Soukup of Coeburn, Virginia.
   Just before the Marines queued up in chow line for their turkey
treats, more than a few of these desert-hardened troops choked back
tears when Chaplain Paschal Dawson led them in a chorus of
``America'' and offered a prayer.
   ``One of the things we have to be thankful for is we live in
America,'' said Dawson, a native of Homer, Louisiana. ``Although
we're here, it's not the end of the world. We're here to do what we
got to do.''
   Because it was a holiday, most of the Marines had light duties
and took advantage of their free time to play volleyball, pitch
softballs, wrestle in the sand and write letters home.
Coincidentally, it was the unit's 100th day in the desert.
   ``It's a small price to pay when you're one of the world's
finest,'' said Lance Cpl. Eddie Simpson of Sligo, Pennsylvania, who
was showing off his pet scorpion named ``Taz.''
   ``Marines are funny,'' said 2nd Lt. Tim Nichols of Sterling,
Virginia. ``They bitch a lot. It's hot. The scorpions stink. The
wild dogs come around in the morning. But we'll stay out here as
long as we're needed.''
   The dinner came from a field kitchen of the 1st Marine
Expeditionary Force, probably the largest field kitchen in the
Marine Corps since World War II.
   Cooks got up at 3 a.m. to begin preparing 12,000 fresh turkey
dinners. About 3,000 troops deployed closest to the Kuwaiti border
had to settle for the military version of turkey TV dinners.
   They cooked 2,500 pounds of turkey, a ton of ham, 34 cases of
shrimp, 34 cases of potatoes and handed out over 1,800 pies. They
also distributed 2,000 cases of soda pop, enough for each Marine to
get two cans.
   One of the dinners cooked here was delivered to President George
Bush, who dined with another unit.
   They didn't hear Bush's speech and they couldn't watch football
because the vast majority have no TVs. There were no parades and no
liquor, but there were plenty of flies and desert heat.
   ``You can't be mad because you're away from home,'' said
Corpsman Donnie Henderson, 23, of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. ``Besides,
the Marine Corps is our family.''
   Out in the field, 1st Sgt. Alonzo Sledge of Memphis, Tennessee,
was able to phone his family back in the states and attend
battalion church services. He was also standing by his horseshoe
pit if the president had decided to come by and toss a few ringers.
   ``Everyone should be thankful we're alive to see this day. And
we're free,'' said Sledge, a 20-year veteran of the Corps. ``Lots
of people take things for granted that Marines feel are special.''
   If there were regrets at being away, they were balanced by duty.
   ``People would be fools not to want to be home for Thanksgiving
and Christmas. But we got a job to do,'' said Cpl. Ed Walsh, 21, of
Las Vegas, Nevada.
   ``I'd rather be with the Marines. It's where I belong. They
don't care if you eat your salad with the wrong fork,'' Walsh said.
   But he had a tug from home because his mother sent him a
cassette tape this week that said: ``Thanksgiving's going to be
rough because I won't have you to taste the stuffing to see that
it's just right.''

<HEAD>Britain to Send 14,000 More Troops to Persian Gulf</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Gulf Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Britain announced Thursday it was nearly doubling
its troops deployed in the Persian Gulf, sending 14,000 more
soldiers to join the 16,000 already in the region.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher moved to send more troops to
the gulf on Thursday, at the same Cabinet meeting at which she was
warned she would lose her bid for the party leadership and thus
leadership of the country. She later announced her resignation.
   Mrs. Thatcher has been an implacable opponent of Iraq's takeover
of Kuwait, and her party indicated her policies in the gulf would
be continued.
   Former Defense Minister Michael Heseltine, who challenged Mrs.
Thatcher for the party leadership and prompted her resignation,
expressed his firm support for the new deployment.
   ``It was essential that the military capablity of (the British)
force have total credibilty,'' he said. ``The announcement you have
made this afternoon carries the wholehearted and unanimous
support'' of all Conservatives.
   The new deployments would make the British troop commitment to
the multinational forces in the region the second-largest behind
the United States, which has sent 250,000 and promised another
100,000.
   Defense Secretary Tom King went before the House of Commons to
explain the deployment.
   ``It remains the government's firm objective to resolve this
crisis as soon as possible and by peaceful means,'' he told
lawmakers. ``To do this, it is essential to establish a credible
offensive military option.
   ``Saddam Hussein must be made to realize that he is faced with a
military force that will otherwise compel him to withdraw,'' King
said.
   At least 26 nations have contributed troops to the multinational
effort to force Iraq out of Kuwait, which Saddam Hussein invaded
Aug. 2 in a dispute over land, oil and money.
   The additional troops bring the strength of the 1st Army
Division to 25,000 and total British forces committed to the Gulf
to 30,000, King said.
   The 4th Brigade, currently stationed in Germany, division
headquarters and supporting arms will join the 9,500-strong 7th
Armored Brigade to form the 1st Armored Division, he said.
   The additional brigade will include an armored regiment of
Challenger Tanks, two armored infantry battions with Warrior
fighting vehicles, an armored reconnaissance squadron, a Royal
Artillery field regiment, engineers and other supporting services.
   The government is sending anti-tank Lynx helicopters and the
army's most potent artillery system, the Multiple Launch Rocket
system, King said.
   The system is capable of rapid fire over long range and will be
able to counter Iraq's G5 howitzers.
   King said he discussed the new troop deployment in meetings last
week with Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, who welcomed the news and
offered to help provide food, fuel, trnsport and accomodations.
   The announcement coincided with the resignation of Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, who sat behind King as he addressed the
House of Commons. There was concern that Britain's domestic
political problems not damage the effort to drive Iraqi occupation
forces from Kuwait.

<TEXT>
   A Soviet jetliner overshot an airport runway in
Siberia, breaking both wings and seriously damaging its landing
gear, but none of the 176 passengers was injured, Soviet media
reported Thursday.
   The accident occurred late Wednesday as the Ilyushin-62 flying
from Moscow tried to land at Yakutsk, the government newspaper
Izvestia said.
   First reports from Soviet television Wednesday night said 176
people were killed when the Aeroflot plane crashed at the airport,
2,600 miles east of Moscow. It gave no source for its information.
   But Izvestia said the plane landed in a ravine about one-half
mile beyond the runway. It said the passengers were taken to the
airport terminal, and 20 suffered bruises. One woman was treated in
hospital for unspecified injuries, it said.
   Radio Moscow and other media reported Thursday that the airplane
lost both wings in the crash as well as parts of its undercarriage.
Most media reports said 176 people were aboard but did not say how
many crew were on the plane.
   Valentin Popov, an inspector at the airport, said there were 174
passengers aboard and a crew of 10.
   Marina Potapova, a shift supervisor at the Magan Airport in
Yakutsk, also said 174 passeners were aboard and that nobody was
killed in the accident.
   Ms. Potapova said by telephone that many of the passengers
continued on to their destinations. She did not know whether there
were any foreigners on board. She also said that the plane was in
one piece.
   The independent Postfactum news agency also reported the crash
and said there were no injuries. It said the aircraft collided with
ground installations and was seriously damaged.
   Both Popov and Ms. Potapova said the plane had been diverted to
Magan, the city's second airport, because of poor visibility at the
main Yakutsk airport.

<HEAD>Christian Science Couple Asks Court For Sentence Reduction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Christian Scientist couple convicted of
manslaughter in the death of their 2-year-old son have has asked
for a sentence reduction, charging that their probation is
disruptive and unconstitutional.
   Lawyers for David and Ginger Twitchell filed a memorandum
Wednesday in Suffolk Superior Court seeking to reduce the couple's
10-year probation to five years and to eliminate regular medical
checkups for their children.
   The Twitchells were convicted July 4 of involuntary manslaughter
for relying on spiritual healing to treat their son Robyn, who died
of a bowel obstruction on April 8, 1986. The Twitchells have
appealed the verdict.
   Judge Sandra Hamlin had ordered the Twitchells, who now live in
Brentwood, N.Y., to take their three remaining children for
periodic checkups by a physician and get them immediate medical
attention if they showed signs of serious illness.
   Hamlin also ordered maximum probation supervision. New York
officials believe that means the Twitchells must meet twice a week
with a probation representative, Twitchell attorney Stephen Lyons
told the Boston Herald.
   ``I don't think Judge Hamlin intended the probation to be that
intrusive,'' Lyons said.
   In an affidavit filed with the court, Mrs. Twitchell, 34, said
her two youngest children have had medical checkups and the oldest
has an appointment this week.
   ``Our life as a family would be less disrupted and more calm if
the number of probation visits were reduced and if such visits were
at our home only or if we could have the conversations regarding
medical care by telephone,'' she said.
   The Twitchell children range in age from 1 to 9 years old.

<HEAD>More Troops Sent To Armenia-Azerbaijan Border To Stop Fighting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union on Thursday sent troops to beef
up border posts along the troubled border between the southern
republics of Azerbaijan and Armenia after four days of
ethnic-inspired shootings, Tass reported.
   The official Soviet news agency said Armenian gunmen armed with
heavy-caliber machine guns, trench mortars and flame-throwers
stolen from Soviet army depots have fired on border posts and
several villages inside Azerbaijan.
   A total of two Azerbaijanis and five Armenians have been
reportedly killed.
   Armenians and Azerbaijanis have been clashing for nearly three
years over control of Nagorno-Karabakh, a mainly Armenian region
inside of Azerbaijan. More than 220 people have been killed.
   Soviet Interior Ministry troops have repeatedly been dispatched
to restore order.
   Tass did not say how many troops were sent Thursday, but it
reported that 20 additional soldiers were dispatched Wednesday. As
many as 29,000 troops have been stationed in the area.
   ``The concentration of (government) forces on a small section of
border between the two Transcaucasian republics was necessary to
stop Armenian gunmen,'' Vyacheslav Ponomarev, deputy commander of
the Interior Ministry troops, told Tass.
   He said the gunmen fired for four days on several villages in
the Lachin district of Nagorno-Karabakh and on border posts in the
mountainous Goris district of Armenia.
   ``The border posts are located in the most dangerous areas of
the terrorists' activities,'' Ponomarev was quoted as saying. ``We
believe that this terrorist action had been thoroughly planned.''
   Tass quoted Viktor Polyanichko, second secretary of the
Communist Party of Azerbaijan, as saying that Armenian gunmen ``are
destabilizing the situation in the region. Therefore it is
necessary to act resolutely, efficiently and consistently in
combating them.''
   Polyanichko said 53 people, including children, have been killed
in Lachin since the ethnic violence broke out in February 1988.
   In an attempt to end this dispute, and other ethnic violence,
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev issued a decree in July ordering all
outlawed guerrilla groups to turn in their weapons and disband, The
decree was largely ignored.
   Despite strict laws prohibiting gun ownership, the use of
illegal weapons is a growing problem in the Soviet Union. Many
weapons are stolen from police stations and military bases or sold
by Afghan veterans.

   Israel indicated Thursday it was troubled by
President Bush's plans to meet Syrian President Hafez Assad and
unhappy that Israel was not a stop on the president's Middle East
visit.
   Syria has long been one of Israel's most intractable enemies. It
has one of the biggest Arab armies and sponsors guerrilla groups
that engage pro-Israeli forces in battle in southern Lebanon.
   The new concern surfaced amid strains in U.S.-Israeli ties over
Israel's policies in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``I think to the extent that questions arise in Israel over the
meeting between President Bush and Hafez Assad, they are about the
fact that for the past few months ... senior Americans are visiting
the region,'' but not Israel, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said.
   ``We aren't offended by this,'' Arens said in a speech at Tel
Aviv University, but added pointedly: ``One can easily see that
misunderstandings could arise of the fact that President Bush
travels to Arab countries in the region...but prefers not to visit
Israel.''
   Arens also said there was ``a gap in perception between us and
the United States'' regarding Syria.
   ``In Israel we don't feel such a big difference'' between Assad
and Iraq's Saddam Hussein, he said.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir was more circumspect in expressing
concern.
   ``We only hope this meeting between Assad and the president of
the United States will not encourage an aggressive policy by Syria
toward Israel,'' he said.
   But Shamir also suggested Israel understood Bush's need to
reinforce an Arab coalition against Iraq.
   ``We must look at the meeting tomorrow with Assad on this
background,'' he said in an interview with state television and
radio.
   Shamir is also facing some difficulties in arranging a White
House meeting on his upcoming visit to Washington, Israeli reports
said. They suggested the United States was anxious to avoid
offending its Arab allies in the anti-Iraq coalition.
   Some Israeli editorial writers were also critical of the United
States.
   ``The American disregard for Israel ... is infuriating and
insulting. It creates a deception for the Arabs that after the
Persian Gulf crisis is over the new coalition will be able to march
together toward Jerusalem,'' said the daily Hadashot.

<TEXT>
   An earthquake rocked the Pacific coastline
north of Lima on Thursday, the Geophysical Institute said. No
serious injuries or major damage were reported.
   The temblor, measuring 4.9 on the Richter scale, was centered
170 miles north of Lima, the institute said.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground
motion is 10 times greater. A quake of magnitude 5 can cause
considerable damage in populated areas.
   On May 29, an earthquake registering 6.3 on the Richter scale
killed 135 people in the jungles of northern Peru. Quakes are a
frequent occurrence in the region.

<TEXT>
   Egyptian security agents sealed off parts of
an eastern suburb Thursday as President Bush began an 18-hour visit
in Cairo. The measures were the tightest in memory for a visiting
head of state.
   Hours before the president and Mrs. Bush arrived, rangers armed
with automatic rifles conducted anti-terrorist drills at Cairo
International Airport where the president's Air Force One was to
park.
   Police with dogs patrolled the airport.
   Other security agents warned residents along the six-mile
motorcade route to the palace where the Bushes were staying to
shutter their windows, close their curtains and stay indoors as the
official motorcade passed by.
   Hundreds of uniformed and plainclothed policemen lined the
motorcade route, and four helicopters clattered overhead.
   A security helicopter hovered near the airport terminal where
President Hosni Mubarak and his wife welcomed the Bushes.
   About 50 cars trailed the two presidential limousines as the
motorcade set out for the Kubbah presidential guest palace. All
roads leading to the palace had been sealed off by security forces
two hours earlier.
   The palace, the residence of Egypt's last monarch, King Farouk,
is in a 70-acre garden surrounded by thick concrete walls 13 feet
tall with watch towers at the corners.
   Not all the security arrangements proved effective.
   Residents living along the motorcade route said they largely
ignored the orders to stay indoors, opening windows and standing on
balconies to watch the procession.
   Two hours before the Bushes arrived, army rangers with automatic
rifles and wearing fatigues carried out an anti-terrorist drill on
the tarmac where Air Force One was to land.
   About 20 rangers repeatedly rushed toward a man apparently
representing Bush, surrounding him and facing outward to protect
him from imaginary terrorists.

   Rain fell from Texas to New York in advance of a strong cold
front Thursday, and the soaked Northwest got more rain and snow.
   At midday, the cold front extended across north-central Ohio,
south-central Indiana, southeastern Missouri and south-central
Oklahoma to central Texas.
   Ahead of the cold front, rain extended from western New York
state across western Pennsylvania, western West Virginia, Ohio,
southeastern Indiana, Kentucky, western and central Tennessee,
northwestern Mississippi, and central Arkansas.
   Rain and occasional thunderstorms reached across southern
Arkansas, northern Louisiana, southeastern Oklahoma and from
northeastern Texas to the Texas Big Bend region.
   Flood warnings were posted for sections of eastern Texas after
locally heavy rain overnight that included 5.5 inches at Wills
Point, the National Weather Service said.
   Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., reached 56 degrees just after midnight,
tying the city's high temperature record for November, but then the
cold front moved through and the temperature dropped to 40 degrees
by 5 a.m. Traverse City, Mich., warmed to 63 during the early

   In the Northwest, rain fell over western Montana, the Idaho
Panhandle, Washington and northwestern Oregon, with snow at higher
elevations. Snow also fell in the mountains of west-central
Wyoming.
   Washington's Snoqualmie Pass got 2.5 inches of rain from 3 a.m.
Wednesday to 3 a.m. Thursday, enough to melt snow on the road over
the pass. Warm rain also melted 3 inches of snow cover at Mullan,
Idaho, during the morning.
   Flood warnings were posted for sections of rivers in western
Washington.
   High wind blew across the Northwest and northern Rockies, with

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's international
admirers praised her courage and achievements Thursday after she
announced she would resign. Even her foes tempered scorn with
praise for a formidable adversary.
   Said President Bush, ``I will miss her.''
   He called her ``an outstanding ally of the United States,''
adding, ``You always knew where she was and what she believed.''
   Vitaly Ignatenko, spokesman for Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev, told the independent Interfax news agency: ``Political,
economic and cultural ties between our countries have become of
greater importance'' in the Thatcher era. ``Our relations ... were
marked by constructivism and dialogue.''
   The reluctance Mrs. Thatcher showed toward increasing European
unity was the source of most criticism. But in a joyful and
unambiguous response, Iraq saw the Persian Gulf crisis as cause of
her downfall.
   Bitterness was undisguised in the comment from Argentina's
Nicanor Costa Mendez, foreign minister during his country's 1982
Falklands War with Britain.
   ``I can't say that it makes me sad,'' he said. ``I believe that
the extreme positions - unnecessarily extreme, unjustifiably
extreme - of the prime minister were one of the causes of the war,
and one of the biggest impediments to achieve agreement after.''
   Socialist President Mario Soares of Portugal singled out ``her
systematic opposition to the advances of the European Community.''
   ``During her long mandate,'' he said, ``the preoccupations of
social justice receded many times before purely development
objectives, causing a climate of discontent in British public
opinion to which Mrs. Thatcher appeared insensitive.''
   But Soares also lauded the British prime minister as a
``determined politician (who) took courageous positions on critical
occasions in international life and without doubt marked an era in
the contemporary history of her country.''
   German Finance Minister Theo Waigel noted, ``Despite her
critical position on some questions of European integration, she
accomplished a great deal for European politics.''
   A neutral letter from Socialist President Francois Mitterrand of
France told Mrs. Thatcher she had ``marked an important moment in
the history of your country and that of Europe.''
   Iraqi government spokesman Naji al-Hadithi said growing
opposition to her hard line against Iraq over its invasion of
Kuwait ``buried Mrs. Thatcher'' just as the 1956 crisis over
Britain's attack on the Suez Canal ruined former Prime Minister
Anthony Eden.
   Britain stepped in after Egypt nationalized the canal.
   On Thursday, Britain announced it was nearly doubling its troops
deployed in the gulf as part of the multinational force arrayed
against Iraq, sending 14,000 more soldiers to join the 16,000
already in the region.
   South African President F.W. de Klerk praised Mrs. Thatcher, who
opposed sanctions on South Africa, for standing up to world
pressure and standing by Pretoria.
   ``She had faith in South Africa's ability to solve its problems
in a democratic way ... She had the courage of her convictions,''
he said.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel saidafter hearing of
her resignation that Israel ``feels a moment of sorrow because we
all know this special personality, Mrs. Thatcher, who did many
things and was an outstanding leader.''
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan said the British prime
minister ``is a rare leader of firm convictions who was invigorated
the United Kingdom and I feel great regret that she has withdrawn
from the front line.''
   Belgium's prime minister, Wilfried Martens, applauded ``the
determining role she played during more than 10 years in her own
country and on the international scene.''
   Said Prime Minister Bob Hawke of Australia, ``Even those like
myself who have been at odds with Margaret Thatcher on particular
issues have admired her courage and tenacity of purpose.
   ``Whatever the forces arrayed against her, she was always
prepared to pursue with the utmost vigor those positions in which
she believed.''
   Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers said, ``In the many years that
she placed such an important stamp on the policies of the United
Kingdom, Mrs. Thatcher has shown that she does not avoid making
difficult decisions that she deems to be in the nation's interest.
This, too, is such a decision which deserves respect.''
   Former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, now a
legislator in the European Parliament, said Mrs. Thatcher's
decision to quit was ``dignified and courageous.''
   ``Margaret Thatcher will be seen with Winston Churchill as the
greatest British prime minister of the last 50 years. The curtain
has fallen on the Iron Lady. She deserves our congratulations.''
   Even European Commission President Jacques Delors, Mrs.
Thatcher's archenemy in Europe, spoke of his ``high esteem'' for
her, despite their differences.
   Alfred Dregger, parliamentary leader of Germany's governing
Christian Democratic Union, said Mrs. Thatcher played a major role
in securing Western solidarity in the ``historical conflict for
freedom and democracy. We thank her for that.''
   Former President Reagan spoke with great warmth of his closest
foreign ally.
   ``Margaret Thatcher's resoluteness played a key role in ending
the Cold War,'' he said. ``She stood up to the Soviets and let them
know she meant business. Her deep and abiding dedication to the
principles of liberty and democracy served as an inspiration to
oppressed peoples everywhere who knew that Margaret Thatcher would
never waver in her belief that all men and women are entitled to
live in freedom.''

<TEXT>
   Attorney General Alfonso Gomez resigned
Thursday following public criticism for his punishment of an army
general involved in fighting leftist rebels.
   In an angry letter to President Cesar Gaviria, Gomez objected to
criticisms of officials who battle to maintain democracy.
   Gomez came under fire this month after ordering the removal of
Gen. Jesus Armando Arias, who led the army in a bloody battle
against the leftist guerrilla group M-19.
   M-19 rebels took over Bogota's Palace of Justice in 1985, and
subsequent fighting with the army claimed about 100 lives,
including half the justices on Colombia's Supreme Court.
   The attorney general's office said Arias's troops unnecessarily
killed dozens of civilians in routing the rebels.
   It said Arias failed to protect the lives of hostages held by
the M-19.
   Although Gomez had talked of resigning since August, the Arias
controversy appeared to expedite his exit.
   Army officers and right-wing politicians criticized the attorney
general for ``punishing a defender of society.'' They said former
subversives were being unjustly praised.
   In the years since the Palace of Justice clash, the M-19 has
renounced armed struggle and become a legitimate political party.
   Opinion polls indicate the M-19 will receive more votes than any
other party for seats in an upcoming assembly to reform Colombia's
constitution.
   In his resignation letter, Gomez said politicians are using the
Arias case for their own electoral ends.
   M-19's leader, Antonio Navarro, called the decision to punish
Arias inopportune because it revived past controversy at a time his
group needs support for the constitutional assembly.
   Members of congress rejected the decision to sanction Arias, who
retired from active duty four months ago.
   After the decision, they voted him a symbolic promotion.

   Toy AK-47 assault rifles have been
withdrawn from sale at two major shopping chains in New Zealand in
the wake of the Aramoana massacre that left 14 people dead.
   The Cargo King stores have removed their stock of about 2,000
toy rifle replicas from shelves, saying it would be insensitive to
offer them for sale.
   Cargo King managing director Wally Brewer said the store had
offered the plastic AK-47 replicas the past three or four Christmas
seasons and they had been a big seller. The recalled stock was
likely to be ``thrown away,'' he said.
   Woolworths, with 52 outlets, has also withdrawn the toy rifles.
   Last week, David Gray used a Chinese-made AK-47 rifle and other
weapons during a rampage in the village of Aramoana on New
Zealand's South Island, killing 13, including three children,
before being fatally shot by police.

<HEAD>Christian Militia Agrees to Withdraw from Beirut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Lebanese Forces Christian militia
agreed Thursday to withdraw from east Beirut to allow the
government to create a militia-free capital and reunite Beirut
after 15 years of civil war.
   Druse and Shiite Moslem militias already have pulled out of
districts they controlled in the combat-scarred city of 700,000
people.
   Samir Geagea, commander of the 6,000-strong Christian force,
said he set no deadline for the evacuation to allow the government
to decide how soon it will be able to fill the security vacuum
created by withdrawal.
   ``We have agreed to withdraw,'' Geagea said in an interview
broadcast by his TV station, the Lebanese Broadcasting Corp.
   ``We will pull out at a moment's notice once the government
readies the army force that will take over from us to avert a
security vacuum.''
   ``The government will have to set the deadline,'' Geagea said.
   Defense Minister Albert Mansour said earlier Thursday,
``Implementation of the greater Beirut plan will start today.
   ``It will be an Independence Day gift for the Lebanese people.''
   Mansour spoke to reporters after a modest military parade in
Moslem west Beirut to mark 47 years of independence from France for
this nation of roughly 3.5 million people.
   The decision marked a change in attitude by the Lebanese Forces,
the Christians' main fighting machine in the civil war against
Moslems. The militia had defied a government order to withdraw by
last Monday, Nov. 19.
   Geagea explained that the government ``has given us solid
guarantees to prevent any reprisals in east Beirut after we pull
out.''
   He had demanded assurance that his Christian rival, Elie
Hobeika, would not move into east Beirut once the Lebanese Forces
leave.
   Hobeika's militiamen and Syrian-backed irregulars moved into the
eastern suburbs after Lebanese army units backed by a Syrian army
contingent crushed an 11-month rebellion by Gen. Michel Aoun in an
eight-hour battle on Oct. 13.
   A Lebanese Forces official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the retreat to the hinterland several miles north and
northeast of Beirut ``could be completed in a day or two.'' He
would not speculate on when it might begin.
   Greater Beirut stretches along a 15-mile coastal strip from the
Dog River in the north to the Damour River in the south.
   President Elias Hrawi told the nation over television Wednesday
that ``greater Beirut is coming and no one will be able to prevent
its emergence.''

<HEAD>Vatican Denies Its Bank Held Shares in Drug Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Vatican on Thursday denied a German
television report that its bank once held shares in a drug company
producing birth control pills.
   However, a spokesman at the Geneva headquarters of the
pharmaceutical company Serono, named in the report, said the
Vatican did have shares in its Rome subsidiary in the 1960s and
possibly early 1970s. The spokesman, Cristophe Lamps, however,
denied the company made birth control pills.
   ``We're just the opposite. We are the leader in fertility''
treatment, Lamps said in a telephone interview.
   The Vatican vigorously prohibits its faithful to use any form of
artificial birth control. The pope recently urged Roman Catholic
pharmacists not to sell drugs that directly or indirectly hurt
life.
   The German television report Wednesday night on private station
RTL Plus alleged that the church received financial gain from the
sale of birth control pills while the Vatican bank held a majority
of shares in Serono.
   The report alleged that Serono began producing birth control
pills in 1968, the year the Roman Catholic Church staunchly laid
out its opposition to artificial contraceptive methods in Pope Paul
VI's encyclical ``Humanae Vita.''
   The report said the Vatican bank, formally called the Institute
for Religious Works (IOR), sold its shares in Serono in 1970 to a
Milan-based bank, in which it held a 20 percent stake.
   ``The IOR never possessed shares in the cited pharmaceutical
company (Serono), something that would be without a doubt be
contrary to the aims of the Institute,'' Vatican spokesman Joaquin
Navarro said in a written statement.
   When told the Vatican had denied its bank had held shares, Lamps
said he didn't know which specific agency of the Vatican held the
shares.
   Lamps said he could not say whether the Vatican holdings in
Serono had constituted a majority.
   Navarro could not be reached for further comment.
   Lamps said similar reports linking the Vatican and Serono have
surfaced in the past.

   A commercial laundry worker was killed when he was
apparently knocked into a huge dryer by 100 pounds of wet clothing.
   Alfredo Castro, 31, was preparing to clean the dryer Wednesday
night when a pile of wet laundry came down a shuttle belt and
somehow knocked him inside the machine, police said.
   Castro was trapped inside the dryer at the H &amp; L Association for
its six-minute cycle and ejected when it was completed, police
said.
   Co-workers heard a loud thumping noise coming from the machine,
then spotted bloodstained clothing and eventually Castro's body
being ejected. He was pronounced dead at Boston City Hospital.
   William Day, controller for the association, said he did not

   ``Oh, God, this is a tragedy,'' he said.
   Police said they believe the death was an accident.

<TEXT>
   Advisors to Mikhail S. Gorbachev indicated
Thursday that economic and political problems at home may prevent
the Soviet president from collecting his Nobel Peace Prize in
person, Norwegian television reported.
   NRK television correspondent Hans-Wilhelm Steinfeld reported
from Moscow that Gorbachev's staff had discussed Thursday whether
the president should travel to Oslo, Norway, on Dec. 10 to collect
the prize.
   Steinfeld said an adviser to Gorbachev told him that ``if
Gorbachev does not come it is because of the troubles at home.'' He
did not identify the adviser or give other details.
   Previous reports have suggested Gorbachev might not stay the
usual three days in Norway that peace prize winners normally spend
to attend a banquet and give a speech. But Gorbachev did say, when
he was awarded the prize last month, that he would come to Oslo to
receive it.
   Norwegian Foreign Department spokesman Bjoern Blokhus said there
had been ``no word or indication'' from Moscow that Gorbachev was
reversing his plans to come to the prize ceremony.
   The Soviet embassy in Oslo has gotten no word from the Kremlin,
said an official who declined to give his name.
   Gorbachev said during his visit to the Conference on Cooperation
and Security meeting held in Paris this week that his schedule for
early December was not yet set.
   Blokhus said Norway's foreign minister, Thorvald Stoltenberg,
had raised the issue of Gorbachev's schedule with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze during the summit in Paris.
   Norwegian security officials, preparing the most extensive
safety measures they have ever contemplated, have said it is
difficult to plan if they don't know when Gorbachev is coming, how
long he is staying and which events he will attend.
   ``Shevardnadze said Norway would be informed about the extension
of the visit within a few days,'' Blokhus said.

   Margaret Thatcher's resignation improved her

   But the Tories still trail the Socialist Labor Party at the
bookmakers.
   The next election must be held by mid-1992.
   Betting giant William Hill offered odds on a Tory victory of
11-10.
   On Wednesday the odds had been slightly longer at 5-4.
   The Labor Party has led the Tories in opinion polls for more
than a year.
   Bookmakers Ladbrokes said one London bettor lost $39,400 that he
placed on Mrs. Thatcher to win the Conservative Party leadership
struggle.

   Thanksgiving 1990 was a day for some to run a grueling marathon
while most of us sat down and ate too much. Many wolfed down turkey
but a few fed the birds a treat. Restaurants fed the homeless for
free. And Bart Simpson barged down Broadway.
   And in the midst of the good times and celebration, it was a day
of tears for some whose loved ones were in the Middle East.
   Television gave most of the country an armchair view of the 64th
Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York with its marching bands,
floats and helium-filled cartoon character balloons.
   More than 1 million people lined the streets to watch the parade
with many of the youngsters cheering a huge figure of underachiever
Bart Simpson.
   Things didn't go quite so smoothly in Detroit, where a
30-foot-long, $15,000 helium balloon of ``Chilly Willy'' the
penguin broke away late Wednesday and floated away.
   At parade time Thursday, a pilot spotted the flightless bird at
an altitude of about 5,000 feet over Detroit, said Bill Robertson,
control tower manager at Windsor Airport, across the Detroit River
in Ontario.
   The Coast Guard recovered it later in Lake St. Clair, 45 miles
north.
   Thousands of people also lined downtown streets in Philadelphia
to watch bands, floats, giant balloons and more than 5,000 marchers
under a warm, clear sky. ``There's a lot of good spirit here, plus
it's a perfect dy for a parade,'' said Bill McColgan, 32, of
Levittown, Pa.
   Kermit the Frog returned to the New York parade in honor of
Muppets creator Jim Henson, who died this year. ``Kermit makes me
sad,'' said New Yorker Paul Oppold, 27, who lost his smile when the
green frog was tugged into view.
   At the end of the parade, about 20 AIDS activists unfurled
banners that read: ``4,752 AIDS Deaths 'till Christmas'' and ``Ask
Santa Claus for National Health Care.''
   While people stood on the curb to watch in New York, and others
put their feet up in front of the tube, about 30,000 people donned
sweatsuits and thundered off on the Atlanta Track Club's annual
26.2-mile marathon. The route they followed is the one recommended
for marathon events when Atlanta is host to the 1996 Summer
Olympics.
   Thanksgiving was a little sadder in coastal Georgia, where
families of soldiers sent to the Persian Gulf with the 24th
Infantry Division kept each other company.
   ``My husband called last night. It was fantastic,'' said Brenda
Mustoe of Savannah, whose husband, Victor, is a chief warrant
officer with the division. However, ``This is all I've been doing
today - crying,'' she said.
   ``This is the worst thing in the world,'' said Judy Rachell, of
Belleville, Ill.; two of her three children are in Saudi Arabia.
Mrs. Rachell said she at first didn't want to prepare a
Thanksgiving dinner but her husband insisted nothing be different.
``So I'm preparing the meal and I plan to set places for my sons.''
   A 77-year tradition continued in the hamlet of Vattman, Texas,
where Thanksgiving is a community rather than family event and
locals and outsiders turn out for a picnic and games and dancing.
``I'm so elated. It's so grand. I couldn't ask for anything
nicer,'' said Teddy Marie Wallace during a brief lull in serving
the midday dinner crowd.
   In Seattle's Occidental Park, Mayor Norm Rice and the Strand
Helpers served a noontime turkey meal to more than 200 homeless
people.
   Denver restaurateur ``Daddy'' Bruce Randolph cooked for 100,000
in his 29th annual Thanksgiving free feast for the needy.
   Randolph said he had plenty of food. ``There are no cutoffs in
the number of people who can come to dinner,'' he said.
   At Al's Place in Tulsa, Okla., proprietor Al Beck provided free
breakfast for about 500 people.
   ``I got just a little bit tired of these people coming by here
hungry all the time,'' said Beck. ``I saw 'em eating out of the
Dumpster. You've know you have some problems when that happens.''
   Some Arkansas residents benefited from the work of an Oklahoma
City program. About 75,000 pounds of turkey, chicken, canned
vegetables and cookies were distributed to 2,000 people in the
towns of Dumas, Wright and Eudora by the Feed the Children program
of the Larry Jones Ministries.
   ``Whoever had something to do with it, they done something good
for Eudora because we have a hard time here,'' said Eudora resident
Indiana Birt, who is in her 80s. She had expected her Thanksgiving
meal to consist of sweetbread and leftover chicken wings.
   In Florida, volunteers at the Miami Rescue Mission prepared 1
ton of turkey meat, 1,000 pounds of dressing, 45 cases of potatoes
and 40 cases of string beans for the homeless and needy.
   Turkey wasn't the main attraction everywhere.
   About 25 turkeys had the table all to themselves at the Farm
Sanctuary, a 175-acre refuge in Watkins Glen, N.Y., where unwanted
farm animals can live out their lives.
   A turkey's table manners are strictly for the birds, said
Blanche Kent, the farm's shelter manager. ``They peck at each
other's plates,'' Kent said. ``They're excited by all the colors,
especially the red in the cranberries. And they love pumpkin pie.''

   Officials said Thursday that as many as
200,000 sheep may have been killed after a series of bush fires
that also destroyed 395,000 acres of valuable grazing land.
   The Department of Agriculture in New South Wales said the fire
in the southwest area of the state known as the Riverina affected
20 major property owners.
   The blaze, which began Wednesday morning, was contained by late
Thursday after firefighters from neighboring communities and
volunteers from Sydney assisted in the fighting the fire.
   In early December, killing of surplus sheep - approximately 10
percent, or 20 million - of Australia's stock, is scheduled to
begin. The slaughter will involve mostly old stock in an attempt to
cut down on an oversupply of sheep brought on by lower wool prices,
high interest rates and poor mutton sales.
   The 200,000 sheep killed in the fire were considered prime stock
and would not have been considered for the slaughter, officials
said.

   A police officer and gunman were killed in
a shootout Thursday when a SWAT team stormed a house to arrest a
man wanted for wounding another officer earlier in the day.
   The shootout erupted when Prince William County Police SWAT team
members arrived Thursday morning at the home of Mark Francis Arban,
sought in the shooting of a sheriff's captain during a traffic stop
about six hours earlier.
   When Arban refused to open the door, police broke it down with a
battering ram, said Prince William police Sgt. Barry Bernard.
   A shot was fired as police entered the house, but Bernard said
it was not known who fired it.
   ``Several minutes passed - I'm not certain how long - then there
was another exchange of gunfire,'' he said.
   Arban, 31, and Philip Michael Pennington, 35, an 11-year veteran
of the Prince William force, were fatally wounded, said Bernard.
   Arban died inside the house, where he lived alone in this city
about 20 miles south of Arlington. Pennington died in a hospital
emergency room.
   Police were trying to determine how many shots had been fired,
Bernard said. Police carried what appeared to be semiautomatic
rifle out of the house, witnesses said.
   Arlington County Sheriff's Capt. Daryl Laclair, 36, was shot in
the face and left elbow shortly after midnight as he approached a
car on a busy county highway, said authorities. The motorist had
motioned for the captain to pull over.
   Laclair was hospitalized in satisfactory condition Thursday, a
hospital official said.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher called it quits
Thursday, leaving her nation transformed by 11{ years of
Thatcherism and her party torn by a bitter and potentially
destructive struggle for succession.
   The ``Iron Lady'' informed her Cabinet of her decision to resign
the morning after she declared she would ``fight on'' to a second
round of the leadership election against former Defense Minister
Michael Heseltine.
   ``She told us of her decision and then got on with business,''
said Transport Secretary Cecil Parkinson. At the same Cabinet
meeting, she decided to commit 14,000 more British troops to the
Persian Gulf.
   As flowers and tributes poured into the official residence at 10
Downing Street, she passionately defended her government against a
motion of no-confidence introduced by Labor Party leader Neil
Kinnock.
   ``I'm enjoying this! I'm enjoying this!'' she shouted in the
House of Commons, full to overflowing for a sometimes rude,
sometimes sentimental debate. A tired-looking Mrs. Thatcher was
sometimes hoarse and frequently coughed.
   The motion of censure, which could have brought down the
government, was resoundingly defeated by a 120-vote majority in the
650-seat House late Thursday, with no Tory defectors.
   No longer shackled by loyalty, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd
and treasury chief John Major earlier Thursday quickly jumped into
the leadership contest, which will be settled next week. Thursday
was the deadline for nominations.
   After succeeding Laborite James Callaghan as prime minister in
1979, Mrs. Thatcher relentlessly promoted capitalism in Britain.
She sold many nationalized industries to private shareholders,
including British Steel and British Airways; crushed the power of
labor unions and cut tax rates.
   By directing a risky but successful war against Argentina in the
Falklands in 1982 and through her close relationship with President
Ronald Reagan, she was widely credited with restoring Britain's
self-image as a world power.
   At home, the party rebellion had been building for years, but
news that Margaret Thatcher walked away from a fight surprised the
world.
   ``I thought she'd duke it out,'' a U.S. Marine in Saudi Arabia
remarked to President Bush. ``So did I,'' the president said.
   Mrs. Thatcher, 65, was Europe's longest-serving prime minister
in this century, the only one to win three consecutive elections,
for 15 years the unchallenged leader of the Conservative Party.
   The ``Iron Lady'' tag was an unintended tribute from Moscow,
from the days in the 1970s when she was opposition leader and an
enthusiastic Cold Warrior.
   She decided to resign two days after joining 33 other world
leaders in signing the Charter of Paris, marking the formal end of
the Cold War.
   Mrs. Thatcher had chosen to play the world stage rather than
stay home to campaign in Tuesday's first-round battle with
Heseltine for the party leadership. She hustled back Wednesday,
replaced her campaign manager and personally lobbied for votes in
the House tearoom, but it was too late.
   Until the Conservatives choose their new leader, Mrs. Thatcher
is still prime minister - and a fighting one at that. She also
retains her seat as a member of Parliament from Finchley in north
London.
   ``I do look back with some pride and some satisfaction at our
achievements for our country over the last 11{ years,'' she said.
   Conservative lawmakers accepted her departure with sadness and
relief, praising her courage in putting the party before herself.
   The Labor Party lauded the grocer's daughter, but didn't hide
its glee. The news, Kinnock said, was ``very good indeed. I cannot
pretend otherwise.''
   Mrs. Thatcher released a statement through her office saying:
``I have concluded the unity of the party and prospects of victory
in a general election would be better served if I stood down to
enable Cabinet colleagues to enter the ballot for the leadership.''
   Kinnock, redirecting his fire to the leader to come, told Mrs.
Thatcher, ``You showed that you amount to more than those who have
turned on you in recent days.''
   He pressed his demand for a national election, which Mrs.
Thatcher said was no more possible than when Labor Prime Minister
Harold Wilson resigned in 1976 and was succeeded by Callaghan.
   Hurd and Major, who issued a joint statement pledging a
``friendly'' campaign, sat together in the House; Heseltine sat
further away.
   Though Mrs. Thatcher finished 52 votes ahead of Heseltine in the
leadership ballot Tuesday, it wasn't enough to win and some Cabinet
members warned her that support was eroding.
   On Tuesday, a simple majority of 187 of the 372 Tory lawmakers
will be sufficient to win. If necessary, a third and final ballot
will be held on Thursday.
   The Conservatives have trailed Labor for 16 months in opinion
polls following a rash of unpopular measures including a per-capita
tax to replace the property tax.
   Anxiety over their chances in a general election, which must be
held by mid-1992, fomented the Conservative Party rebellion that
led to Mrs. Thatcher's downfall.
   Her daughter, Carol, said the prime minister was the victim of
``a gutless act of treachery.''
   The morning Cabinet meeting was solemn and quiet, ministers
said. ``There was a general air of sadness,'' said Education
Secretary Kenneth Clarke. Press Association, the domestic news
agency, quoted ministers as saying Mrs. Thatcher was close to
tears.
   Later, Mrs. Thatcher smiled as she emerged from her office to be
driven to Buckingham Palace to inform Queen Elizabeth II of her
decision. Hundreds of people stood quietly at the barricades to
watch her pass.
   Heseltine, who heard the news while planting an acorn at the
London Zoo, called her rule ``by any standards ... remarkable.''
   ``Nothing I am going to say today is going to diminish or blur
the very high regard people wish to express for what she has
achieved,'' said Heseltine, who resigned as defense secretary in
1986 in a dispute with the prime minister.
   Nigel Lawson, who quit as Mrs. Thatcher's treasury chief last
year told British Broadcasting Corp. radio: ``Margaret Thatcher,
who has never lacked courage, had the courage to resign.''
   ``She has done the right thing for the party and the country,''
he said.

   President Bush shared turkey and trimmings Thursday with
front-line U.S. forces he called ``this American family out here''
in the Saudi desert. In nearby Kuwait, Saddam Hussein reviewed
Iraqi troops he said were prepared to battle ``evil basphemers.''
   An American hostage in Iraq said his Thanksgiving wish was to be
home with his family because ``this is what the day is for.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, meanwhile, sought the
support of Yemen, the only Arab state on the U.N. Security Council,
for a resolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq. Yemen,
which has tilted toward Iraq in the past, did not promise any
backing, but reportedly suggested it might not oppose the measure.
   The anti-Iraq coalition got a boost Thursday with Britain's
announcement it would nearly double its forces in the Persian Gulf,
to 30,000 troops. It could be Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
final act of defiance at the Iraqi president. Mrs. Thatcher said
Thursday she would step down amid disagreements in the ruling party
over her leadership.
   Bush arrived late Thursday in Cairo, Egypt, where he is expected
to meet Friday with President Hosni Mubarak. The Egyptian leader
has led Arab opposition to the Iraqi invasion.
   Later Friday, Bush is scheduled to fly to Geneva, his last stop
on an eight-day overseas trip, to confer with Syrian President
Hafez Assad, a bitter foe of Saddam.
   As the gulf crisis dragged on toward the four-month mark, Saddam
made angry new threats against the U.S.-led lliance trying to
force him to relinquish Kuwait, the oil-rich emirate his troops
overran Aug. 2.
   ``We are not seeking war, but if war is imposed on us we will
fight in a manner that will please friends and incense the evil
blasphemers,'' he told officers in Kuwait, according to the
official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus.
   Saddam's visit to Kuwait was his second since the invasion. He
also toured troop positions in southern Iraq.
   ``We want to tell Bush ... we will destroy you no matter how
heavily your teeth are filled with poison,'' Saddam said Wednesday,
the news agency reported.
   Iraq has an estimated 430,000 troops in Kuwait and southern
Iraq.
   On Thursday, more than 100 European hostages, mainly British and
Swiss nationals, flew out of Baghdad in two chartered planes. Iraq
freed them in response to appeals by French and Swiss delegations.
   Hundreds of U.S. hostages are still being held in Iraq, some of
them detained at key installations as ``human shields'' against
attack. Iraqi authorities brought a dozen of them American captives
to a posh Baghdad country club for a Thanksgiving dinner.
   While glad of a break in the monotony of their months-long
detention, some of the ``guests,'' as Iraq calls them, said they'd
had enough of Iraqi hospitality.
   ``On Thanksgiving Day we should be reunited with our families.
This is what the day is for,'' said Billy Rodebush, 53, of
McAlester, Okla. ``Nobody should be detained against his will.''
   Some Americans who came to Iraq against the advice of the U.S.
government were allowed to visit with family members being held
hostage.
   Bush's one-day visit with soldiers in the Saudi desert marked
the first presidential visit in more than two decades to U.S.
combat troops in the field. The last such trip was President
Nixon's visit to American soldiers in South Vietnam in 1969.
   Bush and his wife, Barbara, clad in camouflage gear, waited in a
chow line with troops deployed at a desolate desert outpost 65
miles from the Kuwait border. Alongside the soldiers, they hunkered
down at makeshift tables made of plywood and sandbags for a turkey
dinner amid the blowing sand.
   ``There could hardly be a prouder moment than sharing
Thanksgiving with this family, this American family out here,'' the
president said.
   U.S. officials said the troops in and around the gulf had a
Thanksgiving meal was the closest the military could come to home
cooking - fresh turkey, ham and roast beef, fruit and vegetables,
sweet or mashed potatoes, and a choice of five kinds of pie for
dessert.
   Some soldiers were also able to listen to a broadcast of the
Detroit Lions- Denver Broncos football game from Pontiac, Mich.
   Still, many were homesick. One soldier - 23-year-old Anibal
Cabezas of New York, with the 82nd Aviation Brigade - said it was
hard to be so far away at the holidays, but added: ``It's a job we
have to get done. That's what we're here for.''
   U.S. officials, meanwhile, are weighing ways to make more troops
available for service in the gulf if needed.
   Pentagon officials said Thursday the Army is considering
freezing the release of officers and enlisted personnel from units
in the United States. That would expand a policy that has been in
effect since August, curtailing release of active-duty troops in
the gulf region and of personnel in some specialties who have not
gone overseas.
   Bush recently ordered the U.S. troop strength in the area nearly
doubled, to more than 400,000, to provide the ability to mount an
offensive if needed.
   Baker, who has been on an international lobbying drive to win
support for a U.N. resolution authorizing force against Iraq, held
talks Thursday with Yemen's president, Gen. Ali Abdullah Saleh.
Afterward, Saleh said foreign forces have ``complicated the
problem, rather than solved it.''
   But a State Department official, asked later about the Yemeni
position on the use-of-force measure, replied: ``They didn't say
no.''
   Any resolution giving advance authority to use military force to
drive Iraq out of Kuwait would have to be approved by the 15-nation
Security Council. Also, Yemen will take over the rotating
presidency of the council from the United States in December.
   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Thursday ``the time is ripe''
to settle the Arab-Israeli tensions and the Lebanese conflict, in
addition to the gulf crisis.
   So far, most Western leaders have resisted linking various
Middle East disputes with the standoff caused by Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait.

<HEAD>Russia Can't Transform Economy Alone, Prime Minister Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Russian republic's 500-day economic reform
plan cannot be fully implemented without the national government's
help, the prime minister of the largest and richest republic said
Thursday.
   Ivan Silayev's comments to the Russian Federation parliament
were a tacit acknowledgment that Russia lacks clear control over
key economic catalysts such as prices, currency, interest rates and
land.
   Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin moved ahead with the 500-day
program to move to a free market economy on Nov. 1, after the
national government adopted a slower, less radical blueprint
favored by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Yeltsin's
political rival.
   The national and Russian governments have issued conflicting
orders that have effectively torpedoed both plans.
   ``A considerable part of the 500-days program can and will be
implemented,'' but it is not a ``totally autonomous republican''
plan and hinges on decisions by the national government, the
official Tass news agency quoted Silayav as saying. Silayav did not
elaborate on his comment, Tass said.
   Russia has half the Soviet Union's 285 million people,
three-quarters of its land mass and the bulk of its natural
resources.
   Earlier Thursday, the Russian parliament accepted the
resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Grigory Yavlinsky, co-author
of a 500-day plan designed to be implemented by the entire Soviet
Union.
   Yavlinsky formally offered his resignation Oct. 17 after
Gorbachev came out in favor of the less radical plan.
   Lawmakers postponed the vote on Yavlinsky's resignation to give
him time to reconsider, but Silayev urged them Thursday to accept
it. Deputies voted 164-17 to accept the resignation, the
independent news agency Interfax reported.
   ``I do this with regret, but Yavlinsky wants to work in another
capacity,'' Tass quoted Silayev as saying.
   A government spokesman said Yavlinsky has been offered the job
as chairman of Yeltsin's council of economic advisers.
   Yavlinsky's resignation came a day after Yeltsin declared the 15
Soviet republics could no longer wait for a new union treaty and
were proceeding on their own to create a new economic union.
   Yeltsin on Wednesday signed a treaty with the Central Asian
republic of Kazakhstan. It was Russia's fourth bilateral treaty
with another republic. The treaties, which bypass the Kremlin,
cover direct economic, political and cultural ties.
   Yeltsin signed a similar treaty with the Ukraine on Monday, and
earlier concluded pacts with Moldavia and Georgia.
   On Thursday, he met Latvian President Anatoly Gorbunov and Prime
Minister Ivars Godmanis to continue negotiating a treaty with the
Baltic republic.
   The Ukrainian treaty was approved by the republic's lawmakers on
Thursday, and parliamentary president Leonid Kravchuk praised it
because ``our desires and actions were not imposed upon us by
anybody.''

   New prime ministers Chandra Shekhar of
India and Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan agreed Thursday to talk out
their differences but refused to budge on the issue that nearly
brought them to war last spring.
   They will resume talks on reducing tensions in Kashmir province
and on two minor border issues, said a joint statement.
   Their meeting on a sandy, tropical Indian Ocean island was the
first in two years by leaders of the two rival nations and the
first foreign policy encounter for both men, who took office less
than three weeks ago.
   It was held during a three-day summit of the seven-nation South
Asia Association for Regional Cooperation.
   Chandra Shekhar told Indian reporters ``I felt right at home''
at his meeting with Sharif. ``It was just like a family gathering.
I found him to be very cooperative. We are both eager to have the
best of relations.''
   India and Pakistan mobilized their armies for war after India
cracked down on pro-Pakistani Moslem insurgents in Jammu-Kashmir,
the only state in Hindu-dominated India with a Moslem majority.
Fighting was averted largely through U.S. diplomatic efforts.
   ``The two prime ministers decided that all differences between
the two countries should be resolved peacefully and through
dialogue,'' said the statement read by Pakistan's foreign
secretary, Shaharyar Khan.
   He said Sharif raised the Kashmir issue and outlined Pakistan's
position. Chandra Shekhar restated India's stand ``on interference
in India's internal matters.''
   Pakistan says Kashmir's future should be determined by a
plebiscite, as called for in United Nations resolutions. India says
Kashmir is its sovereign territory and cannot be severed.
   The issue has simmered since 1947, when colonial India won
independence from Britain and was divided into India and Pakistan
on religious lines. Kashmir, then an independent princely state
ruled by a Hindu king, had the option of joining either country.
The king chose India. Pakistan objected, saying the people of
Kashmir should have had a say.
   Chandra Shekhar said the hostilities were deflecting energy from
the main task of improving the lot of the desperately poor South
Asian countries.
   ``Poverty is the enemy. If we fight each other we won't be able
to fight poverty,'' he said.
   He and Sharif set Dec. 18 as the date for their foreign
secretaries to resume talks on confidence-building measures along
their frontier.

   A fishing boat believed to have four men aboard
was missing Thursday after a British submarine collided with vessel
off Scotland's Isle of Arran, the Royal Navy said.
   Naval helicopters, a frigate and a minesweeper searched for the
fishing boat, Antares, which was reported overdue at its home port
of Carradale, Kintyre.
   A navy spokesman said the boat normally carries a crew of four,
but it was not known how many were on board.
   The spokesman said the sub surfaced after the 2 a.m. collision
and sighted two fishing boats in no apparent difficulties. It
submerged and left after trying unsuccessfully to make contact with
the fishing boats, but reported the incident to the Coast Guard,
the spokesman said, declining to be identified.
   The sub apparently struck the vessel's underwater gear but no
further details were available.
   The spokesman said searchers near Arran in the Firth of Clyde
off the west coast of Scotland later spotted some debris but it was
not ``positively identified as coming from the Antares.''

<TEXT>
   Emperor Akihito on Friday completed a centuries-old
ceremony signifying his accession to the world's oldest hereditary
throne while protests were held against the monarchy and the high
cost of the rite.
   The Shinto ceremony, symbolizing communion with the sun goddess,
has been performed by most of Japan's emperors since at least the
7th century, and in the past was believed to give monarchs their
status as living god.
   But demonstrators across the country criticized the ritual as a
violation of the Japanese constitution's separation of church and
state and questioned the use of nearly $17 million in tax money on
the ceremony.
   Other critics of the Daijosai, or Great Food Offering Ritual,
also believe holding it indicates a desire within Japan's
conservative government to bring back the emperor worship of prewar
days.
   The rite, witnessed by only two female attendants, was held
Thursday night and then repeated before dawn Friday.
   Anti-monarchy radicals marked the beginning of the ceremony by
launching six mortar-like projectiles at an imperial villa in
Kyoto, in western Japan, police said.
   Radicals were also believed to have set fires at three Shinto
shrines and four train stations outside of the capital of Tokyo
just after midnight. No injuries were reported.
   Separate peaceful protests were staged by scholars and labor
unionists, and 1,000 Christians fasted to protest the funding of
the rite.
   Akihito, 56, is the first Japanese emperor to be enthroned since
his father, the late Emperor Hirohito, assumed the Chrysanthemum
Throne 62 years ago.
   He is also the first to assume the throne under Japan's postwar
constitution, which calls him not a god-king but a symbol of his
people's sovereignty.
   Akihito's formal state enthronement ceremony Nov. 12 was viewed
by foreign dignitaries representing 158 countries, but no
foreigners were invited to the communion.
   During the rite, Akihito offered rice, wine and other foods from
around the country to the sun goddess Amaterasu, from whom legend
says the imperial line descended.
   The two women attendants are clad in white and red kimono and
with their hair tied in pony tails nearly 6{ feet long. The
ceremony is held in the torch-lit inner sanctuary of a specially
built hall on the palace grounds.
   The rite is performed only once by each emperor.
   Inside the sanctuary, out of view of the 733 Japanese guests
seated in large tents nearby, the offerings were made to an altar
placed beside a stylized bed, from which the goddess is summoned.
   Scholars before World War II theorized that at one time the
ceremony might have involved the emperor symbolically having sex
with the sun goddess, representing a union with the divine. Palace
officials, however, deny that theory and said the emperor would not
touch the bed.
   The second ceremony was repeated after midnight in an identical
hall yards from the first one.
   Akihito performs dozens of religious ceremonies at the palace
each year, carrying on the priest-king role that has been handed
down from ancient times.
   That role, however, has periodically come under fire since the
end of World War II.
   Hirohito, who died in 1989 at age 87, renounced the concept of
imperial divinity in 1946 at the urging of the U.S.-led occupation
forces. The country's post-war constitution specifies that the
emperor is a national symbol, and not a god-king.

   Hundreds of people spent part of Thanksgiving day
remembering President Kennedy with a visit to the downtown building
where investigators say Lee Harvey Oswald fired the shots that
killed him 27 years ago.
   By the end of the day, more than 700 people visite the Texas

exhibit director Bob Hays.
   The exhibit is open every day of the year except Christmas.
   The exhibit opened on President's Day, 1989, on the sixth floor
of the building where investigators say Oswald perched on boxes and
ate his lunch on Nov. 22, 1963, waiting for the presidential
motorcade to pass by.
   The exhibit features more than 400 photographs and a narrative
detailing Kennedy's life and death. It mentions controversies over
the accuracy of official reports on the assassination and
speculation about whether Oswald had conspirators.

   The body of Rachel Charles was discovered near a hotel close to

   Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble
said Thursday he will remain bound to a wheelchair for some time
after being wounded in an assassination attempt Oct. 12, but hoped
to resume his duties soon.
   Schaeuble, 48, spoke to reporters at a rehabilitation clinic in
southern Germany in his first public appearance since being shot
twice during a campaign appearance. One bullet hit his jaw and the
second struck his spinal cord, paralyzing his legs.
   Authorities said the gunman, Dieter Kaufmann, had a history of
mental disorders and drug addiction.
   Schaeuble said he hoped to resume some duties around Germany's
national elections on Dec. 2.
   ``It is certain that for the foreseeable future, I will have to
live in a wheelchair,'' he said.
   Schaeuble played a major role in readying the treaty on German
unification. He was one of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's closest aides
and was seen as a possible successor to Kohl as leader of the
conservative Christian Democratic Union.
   He said Thursday he viewed the assassination attempt as an
``accident.''

<HEAD>Report: 4,000 Ethiopian Jews Expected in Israel by Next Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 4,000 Ethiopian Jews are expected in
Israel by the end of next month following an agreement in Addis
Ababa to let them emigrate, news reports said Thursday.
   The renewed emigration appears to be the culmination of a
four-month hiatus triggered by tensions between the Ethiopian
government and Israel, Israeli television said.
   Ethiopian leaders accused Israel of failing to honor agreements
reached when the countries renewed diplomatic ties in October 1989,
the report said.
   It said tensions between Jerusalem and Addis Ababa had been
eased but didn't elaborate. Two official Israeli delegations have
visited the Ethiopian capital to discuss the issue the past month.
   Uri Gordon, chairman of the Jewish Agency's Immigration
Department, said 2,822 Jews have come to Israel from Ethiopia since
January, the national Itim news agency reported. Another 1,000 are
expected in the next five weeks, the television report said.
   According to the television report, about 20,000 Jews remain
crowded in difficult conditions in the Ethiopian capital awaiting
permits to emigrate.
   Television showed dozens of an immigrant group of 150 Ethiopians
arriving at Ben Gurion Airport outside Tel Aviv before dawn
Thursday. Most of the adults wore long white embroidered robes and
turbans.
   ``For me today it is like the sunrise,'' newcomer Andshe
Vorbaneh said.
   An Israeli Parliament member visiting Addis Ababa charged
Thursday that Israeli Embassy officials had arbitrarily denied some
Ethiopian Jews visas, claiming they provided inadequate proof of
Jewishness.
   ``Some people who had the right to demand the Law of Return had
the right taken away from them,'' Shimon Shetreet said on Israel
radio.
   The 1950 law guarantees all Jews the right to immigrate to
Israel.
   The Foreign Ministry denied Shetreet's charge, pointing out the
``very strict criteria for those who are entitled to enjoy the Law
of Return and those that cannot.''
   Jewish identity is passed maternally, and Israeli officials say
spotty Ethiopian birth records make it difficult to prove Jewish
backrounds.

<HEAD>Indian Chief: Brazilian Miners Invading Amazon Reserves</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of gold prospectors expelled
from Yanomami Indian lands have invaded other Amazon reserves and
spread malaria among the tribes, an Indian chief said Thursday.
   The claims were made as representatives from 12 indigenous
groups of the far-western Amazon state of Roraima came to the
capital in search of medical aid. The Indian chiefs also want the
government to demarcate their lands and expel the miners.
   Makuxi chief Jaci said Thursday that about 8,000 gold miners
were spreading malaria among his 12,000-member tribe. The Makuxis,
mostly farmers, inhabit a large reserve near the Venezuelan border.
   The Indian leader said 154 of 990 Makuxi in four villages had
been infected the last three months. Five of those had died,
including his own wife.
   In addition, he said 122 ranchers had also occupied large tracts
of the Makuxi reserve, taking advantage of the lack of reserve
markings.
   Last January, the government ordered the miners off the reserve
of the Yanomamis, the world's largest primitive tribe. But since
then the prospectors have poured into a region near the Guyana
border in search of gold and diamonds, Jaci said.
   Neither the National Indian Foundation nor the Justice Ministry
would meet with the Indian chiefs on Thursday, Jaci said.
   The government has said it lacks the money needed to demarcate
the tribes' lands and remove the miners by force.
   ``All the medical attention is given to the Yanomamis. The
government has forgotten the rest of us,'' Jaci complained.
   The Yanomamis are also being decimated by diseases from about
40,000 gold prospectors who have flooded into the mineral-rich
region the last three years.
   Brazil's Indian Missionary Council, sponsored by the Roman
Catholic Church, estimates that 1,500 of the remaining 9,000
Yanomamis have died in three years, most from malaria and sexual
diseases brought by miners. Some have died in conflicts with the
miners, the Council says.
   The Indians' medical situation has improved recently, according
to government officials, because of an emergency health campaign
that it says has cut the incidence of malaria in Indian villages
from 90 percent to 18 percent.
   Federal police have also begun ``Operation Free Yanomami
Jungle,'' to force the miners off the Indian lands. About 140
troops are dynamiting 120 clandestine landing strips cut in the
jungle and used to supply mining sites by air.
   Brazil's Indians have steadily dwindled in number since 1987,
when the clandestine rush to the Amazon began after government
studies indicated a wealth of gold, diamonds, tin and bauxite
there.
   Prospectors and landless peasants have leveled rain forests,
chased off fish and game, polluted rivers with mercury used in gold
panning, and spread diseases previously unknown to the tribes.
   There are about 215,000 native Indians left in Brazil, down from
an estimated 5 million when the Portuguese landed here in 1500.

   Socialist deputies carried Prime Minister
Andrei Lukanov's austerity budget through Parliament early Friday,
but main opposition parties boycotted the secret ballot and moved
for a vote of no-confidence.
   Approval of the budget - 186 votes for, 10 against, seven
abstentions and one invalid ballot - ended weeks of parliamentary
squabbling.
   Lukanov had pinned his fate and that of his government on budget
approval.
   The Union of Democratic Forces boycotted the vote and demanded a
separate vote of no-confidence in the 400-seat Grand National
Assembly.
   Socialist deputies agreed to meet the challenge, but only when
Parliament reconvened later Friday.
   Lukanov's foes decided to shun the budget vote after losing,
197-160, on a vote to decide the issue by secret ballot instead of
the regular show of hands.
   The Socialists, formerly the Communists, ousted hard-line leader
Todor Zhivkov on Nov. 10, 1989, won free elections in June and
named Lukanov premier.
   His popularity has waned because of political stalemate,
rationing and shortages of food and consumer goods. His foes claim
they would win new elections.
   The opposition rejects Lukanov's invitation to join a broad,
Socialist-led coalition government, insisting instead on choosing
the premier and holding key ministries.
   However, one prominent UDF leader, Rumen Vodenicharov, on
Thursday assailed the opposition leadership for boycotting the vote
and charged it with ``being blinded by the desire to get into
power.'' He said he was quitting the coalition's parliamentary
group and would continue in Parliament as an independent.
   He told deputies he supported the budget measures, which include
privatization and price rises of 200 to 500 percent on some basic
consumer goods, including some foods, to offset a budget deficit.
   Vodenicharov said the opposition promoted ``obstructive
politics, that are only delaying the start of economic reform.''
   Lukanov has faced increasing public pressure to resign, as
disgruntled Bulgarians have taken to the streets protesting their
economic straits.
   Up to 50,000 supporters and opponents of the governing
Socialists had massed outside the Grand National Assembly to wait
for the results of the parliamentary session Thursday.
   Opposition supporters formed a human chain around the building
but were kept at bay by police, some in riot gear.
   Only a few hundred remained outside in the wintry weather by the
time the result was announced.
   Inside, a brief scuffle broke out at the rostrum at one point
and microphones were overturned in a dispute over whether the
budget vote or a no-confidence vote should come first. Order was
quickly restored.
   Lukanov's Socialist Party has a majority of 210 seats, against
144 seats for the opposition Union after Vodenicharov's defection.
The Agrarians have 16 seats and the ethnic Turkish Movement for
Rights and Freedoms hold 23. Small parties and independents hold
the remainder.
   The Socialists have been unable to halt economic decline and
improve food supplies, but rejected calls to hand power to the
opposition.
   The resulting deadlock has fueled street protests and pressure
on the Lukanov government to resign because of ``inaction.''
   The opposition Podkrepa trade union called a general strike
starting Monday if Lukanov did not step down Thursday.

<HEAD>Romanian Spy Chief Wants Securitate Files to Stay Shut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN PETREANU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief of Romania's new
intelligence service told lawmakers Thursday the files of the late
Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu's Securitate secret police
should stay closed indefinitely.
   Virgil Margureanu, boss of the newly created Romanian
Intelligence Service, addressed Parliament before deputies debated
a planned law regulating the service's operations.
   He said opening Securitate files to the public could cause
instability and fan suspicion.
   Many government opponents insist the Securitate has not been
disbanded and still taps phones, intercepts mail and employs other
methods used under Ceausescu to control Romanian society. That
belief is shared by many Romanians.
   Last month, Margureanu told reporters that authorities would
reveal the names of former Securitate agents. He backed away from
that position Thursday.
   He said keeping Securitate files sealed ``would be a natural
solution for consolidating a climate of stability ... and
eliminating the sources of suspicion.''
   Margureanu said the Securitate had employed 14,259 military and
984 civilian personnel. Last month, he acknowledged that the new
intelligence service had rehired some former Securitate agents.
   Margureanu appealed for swift passage of the law, saying it
would help his agency deal with a ``fascist'' menace and hundreds
of terrorist threats he claimed were received by Romanian
politicians.
   Since the Communist dictatorship was ousted and Ceausescu was
executed last December, many officials have warned of a resurgence
of fascism by former members of the Legionnaires' movement that
supported Nazi Germany.
   They are said to have been active outside the country during
Romania's 45 years of Communist rule.
   Opposition figures say the government is trying to whip up a
fear of renewed fascism to divert attention from the deteriorating
economy and other issues.
   Margureanu insisted his service was not tapping phones or
intercepting mail.
   Anti-government protests continued in Bucharest Thursday. About
2,000 protesters marched downtown shouting slogans against
President Ion Iliescu and Premier Petre Roman, whose National
Salvation Front took power in the revolution and won elections in
May.
   In Sibiu, thousands ook part in an anti-government rally
Thursday organized by the opposition National Peasant Party, the
Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania, and several unions.
   Tension rose in Romania after the government on Nov. 1 ordered
price increases that doubled and tripled the cost of many items.
Most essential foods, energy and rents remain subsidized for now.

   The national newspaper Tempo announced
Thursday it will close next week, making it the ninth major victim
in Portugal's collapsing press market.
   On Wednesday, the Lisbon evening paper Diario de Lisboa said it
will fold Nov. 30.
   They will bring to nine the number of major daily and weekly
papers to shut down since the end of a press boom in the late
1980s, when a crop of new publications hit the stands. Investors
had hoped for advertising revenue in one of Europe's fastest
growing economies.
   But the market was unable to sustain the increasing number of
papers in a country where almost 20 percent of the 10.3 million
people are illiterate.
   The weekly Tempo was founded in 1975 as a conservative voice
while much of the media swung to the left following a 1974
revolution that overthrew Portugal's 48-year rightist dictatorship.
   The paper's editorial line was often marked by a strong
opposition to leftist movements in Portugal's former African
colonies.
   The paper, which had a circulation of 71,000 in 1978, currently
sells about 17,000 copies.
   The center-right government is hoping to boost the press
industry by privatizing state-owned papers.
   Several papers have been sold and the last remaining state-owned
paper, Diario de Noticias, is scheduled for privatization next
year.

<TEXT>
   Members of the Medellin cocaine cartel
offered Thursday to turn themselves in if the government protects
their security and promises not to send them to the United States.
   A statement from the cartel said from 200 to 300 of its members
would be willing to congregate in a special, army-protected
compound.
   Such a surrender ``implies the end of all activities related to
drug trafficking or narcoterrorism,'' it said.
   It did not indicate if the surrender offer included Pablo
Escobar, the Medellin cartel's leader.
   The statement was given to the presidency, which distributed it
to news media.
   In response, Justice Minister Jaime Giraldo outlined legal
guarantees drug traffickers would enjoy upon surrendering.
   In September, President Cesar Gaviria offered to bar
extraditions and cut jail sentences of drug traffickers who gave up
and confessed their crimes.
   The traffickers on Thursday apparently accepted - with
conditions.
   They asked not to be required to confess, saying this would
constitute self-incrimination, ``prohibited even in the United
States.''
   Giraldo said, ``A confession of all crimes committed is not
required, just some of them.''
   He said traffickers who surrender ``can be sure they will not be
extradited.''
   The traffickers said they would expect special army protection
and oversight by world human rights organizations.
   The cartel has been blamed for killing about 550 Colombians
since the government and drug traffickers declared war on each
other after a political assassination in August 1989.
   Traffickers have kidnapped nine journalists. Drug bosses said
the abductions were a response to human rights abuses by police in
Medellin, the cartel's home city.
   The drug smugglers also apparently are trying to pressure
authorities to grant them a pardon.
   On Thursday, the drug lords said they should not be treated like
common criminals.

   President Bush says he is in a hurry to sign
a free-trade pact with Mexico.
   ``We have made a commitment to a free-trade agreement with
Mexico. We want to do it as soon as possible,'' Bush told the
Mexican government news agency Notimex in an interview made public
Thursday.
   The interview, published in Spanish, was conducted in
Washington, and released four days before Bush is scheduled to meet
with Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari in the northern
state of Nuevo Leon.
   The free-trade agreement is expected to be one of the main
topics of discussion at the two-day summit beginning Monday.
   Bush said he looks favorably on including Canada in talks for a
three-way free-trade agreement, but only if that doesn't slow the
process.
   ``If the effort to broaden the process is not viable because it
produces unacceptable delays, we will proceed bilaterally with
Mexico,'' Notimex quoted Bush as saying.
   Canadian finance and labor representatives have warned Mexico to
proceed with caution in signing such an agreement. Canada and the
United States signed a bilateral trade agreement in 1988; the pact
began in part this year.
   Bush said he was grateful for Mexico's continued supply of
petroleum exports, especially in the wake of the embargo on Middle
Eastern oil imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Notimex
reported.
   The president also expressed interest in U.S. investment in
Mexico's nationalized oil industry.
   ``We recognize that petroleum frequently has been an area of
special sensitivity for Mexico, particularly in its relations with
the United States. However ... I am convinced that there are
important areas in which we can work together and which can be
mutually beneficial for increased investment and exploration of
petroleum and natural gas,'' the agency quoted Bush as saying.
   The Mexican government nationalized the oil industry in 1939,
ousting foreign corporations. Salinas' 2-year-old administration
has returned many nationalized industries, including
petrochemicals, to the private sector.
   But Salinas has maintained that primary petroleum production
will remain in the hands of the state.

<HEAD>Report: Albania Rejects Foreign Pressures for Reforms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Albania, the last hard-line Communist
country in Europe, said Thursday it wants to take part in European
integration but it rejected the idea that foreign pressure could
set the pace for reforms there.
   An editorial in Albania's official Zeri i Popullit newspaper
also indicated that the Tirana leadership is still opposed to the
type of radical changes that swept Communists from power in Eastern
Europe.
   Albanian officials attended this week's 34-nation European
summit in Paris as observers.
   According to excerpts of the editorial carried by the state-run
news agency ATA, monitored in Vienna, democratization is under way
in politics, the economy and human rights.
   But the report said it was ``not normal'' that Albania does not
receive credit in Europe for the changes.
   The editorial quoted President Ramiz Alia, who is also the party
leader, as saying some European leaders ``are using their consensus
regarding Albania as a pressure to dictate different political
recipes and conditions to our country.''
   It did not mention specific European leaders, according to the
ATA report, Alia reportedly told a recent party meeting that
Albania will do nothing under foreign ``dictate'' and added, ``The
Albanian people have never put on auction their freedom,
independence and national sovereignty.''
   Following the Eastern European revolutions, Albania has moved
slowly to open up to the outside world, increasing contacts and
trade with foreign governments and allowing visits by foreign news
media. But the changes have not gone as far as multiparty
elections.
   Albania ``will continue to march in the spirit of European
developments and will render its modest contribution to the whole
process'' of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe,
the editorial said.

   Michael R. Milken, who revolutionized American
finance in the booming 1980s but became a symbol of its excesses,
was sentenced to 10 years in prison for his role in the biggest
scandal in Wall Street history.
   U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood's sentence was by far the
stiffest in the insider trading probe that focused on Milken after
speculator Ivan Boesky confessed to rampant lawbreaking in late
1986.
   Milken, 44, sobbed during Wednesday's proceeding but stood
expressionless as Wood announced the punishment. The judge called
Milken ``a man of talent and industry'' but said his crimes merited
lengthy incarceration.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Treasury Department is considering
restricting each American to three federally insured bank, savings
institution or credit union accounts - no matter how little money
is in each.
   The department asked the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to
estimate how much the proposal would save and to describe potential
problems in administering it, FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said
Wednesday.
   The Independent Bankers Association of America is vigorously
opposed.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Laventhol &amp; Horwath, the nation's
seventh-largest accounting firm, filed for bankruptcy court
protection, but said its partners would continue to service clients
so the firm could pay its debts.
   Philadelphia-based Laventhol, which said earlier this week it
would be forced to make the Chapter 11 filing, was prompted in part
by the cost of settling or defending itself against more than 100
lawsuits seeking tens of millions of dollars in damages.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - A congressional report supports a charge that
lenders are miscalculating rate changes on adjustable-rate
mortgages.
   The General Accounting Office, in a letter to Sen. Richard
Lugar, R-Ind., said its research supported whistleblower John M.
Geddes' ``basic observation that some ... adjustment mistakes are
taking place.''
   However, most people interviewed by the congressional watchdog
agency said they believe Geddes overstated the extent of the
problem. He estimated 35 percent of all adjustable-rate mortgages
have been misadjusted and that borrowers were overcharged $8
billion from 1979 to 1989.

   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - A suburban Philadelphia woman faces charges
she tried to sell a secret SmithKline Beecham marketing plan to one
of the drug maker's main competitors, the FBI said.
   Rebecca J. Lindquester, 42, of Newtown Square, was arrested
after exchanging photocopies of the marketing plan with a
representative of a competing drug company, which had notified the
authorities, FBI Special Agent Wayne R. Gilbert said Wednesday.
   The competing drug company, Glaxo Inc. of Raleigh, N.C.,
produces Zantac, an ulcer drug that competes with the SmithKline
Beecham product Tagamet.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Earnings soared for major oil-producing
countries but U.S. oil companies showed only a modest increase in
profits as a result of the price jump caused by the Persian Gulf
crisis, the government said.
   A report released Wednesday by the Energy Information
Administration said while the big oil companies nearly doubled
their earnings from petroleum production in the third quarter, most
of those gains were offset by reduced earnings from refining,
marketing and chemical business.

   TOKYO (AP) - A four-year boom that brought a new era of
affluence to Japan appears to be subsiding as a labor shortage,
higher interest rates and the Persian Gulf crisis take their toll

   But demand for domestic goods and strong corporate investment
will insulate the economy from the worst of the U.S. economic
downturn and ensure that land prices fall gradually rather than

   A four-year boom that brought a new era of
affluence to Japan appears to be subsiding as a labor shortage,
higher interest rates and the Persian Gulf crisis take their toll
on the economy.
   Demand for domestic goods and strong corporate investment will
insulate the economy from the worst of the U.S. economic downturn
and ensure that land prices fall gradually rather than plummet,
said Russell Jones, an economist at UBS Phillips and Drew
International Ltd.
   But growing corporate bankruptcies and lackluster mid-year
corporate profits are signs that the economy is shifting into lower
gear after four years of annual growth of 5 percent or more,
analysts say.
   ``The economy's beginning to slow, but it's a slow slowdown. The
deceleration is not that pronounced - it's not a collapse,'' Jones
said.
   Most economists cite higher interest rates - introduced to cool
inflation - as a key constraint, especially for smaller firms that
borrow for investment.
   The Bank of Japan has raised the official rate it charges
commercial banks five times since May 1989, from 2.5 percent to 6
percent. That has ended the source of cheap capital that helped
fuel the boom that began in December 1986.
   Partly because of higher interest rates, corporate bankruptcies
in Japan increased in October for the first time in 70 months,
climbing 9.7 percent from the year before to 645 cases, Teikoku
Data Bank reported.
   Hardest hit were real estate firms, weakened by flattening land
prices, and small- and medium-size manufacturers suffering from a
severe labor shortage, the private credit research agency said.
   At the same time, companies found their financial cushions of
stock assets flattened by lower share prices.
   The Nikkei Stock Average, the Tokyo market's key indicator, has
dropped more than 40 percent this year. The return on financial
assets has plummeted, and cheap equity financing has become
difficult, said Masahide Tsuru of the Long Term Credit Bank's
economics division.
   ``The bankruptcies indicate the impact of the labor shortage and
interest rates at the operating level. ... At the recurring level,
declines in the equity and bond markets are compounding
everything,'' said Peter Morgan, chief economist at Barclays de
Zoete Wedd Securities Japan.
   A survey by Wako Research Institute of Economics showed that
profits of major corporations for the six-month period ending in
September climbed only 0.03 percent from the same period in 1989.
During the previous six months, profits climbed 14.4 percent from a
year earlier.
   The survey excluded banks and securities firms, whose profits
have fallen sharply with the Nikkei's plunge.
   Manufacturers, meanwhile, are facing lower demand from importers
in the United States, which is undergoing a more pronounced
downturn. Japanese semiconductor manufacturers have already
announced they will slash computer chip output because of lower
demand from U.S. importers.
   Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for about 60 percent
of gross national product, has begun to slow, partly because of the
bearish financial markets.
   Higher interest rates also have made credit purchases of major
items such as cars and homes much more costly, said Johsen
Takahashi, director of the private think-tank Mitsubishi Research
Institute.
   Consumption, which grew steadily by 2 percent to 3 percent until
May, began to slow in July. It rose only 0.6 percent in September
from a year earlier, marking the slowest growth this year, the
Management and Coordination Agency said in a report released
Wednesday.
   Not all the economic news is bad for Japan, though. Lower U.S.
interest rates have tended to weaken the dollar, making the yen
relatively stronger, noted Barclays de Zoete Wedd's Peter Morgan.
   That means Japanese products are more expensive abroad, but
imports of fuel and other goods are cheaper. That's become
increasingly important with surging oil prices caused by the Middle
East crisis.
   Barring a major cut in oil supplies, economists expect Japan's
economy to continue chugging along, although at a slower pace. Most
expect economic growth to remain at a robust 5 percent to 6 percent
in 1990 and to level off over the next several years to around 4
percent.
   ``This isn't going to be a recession. There won't be a huge fall
in the standard of living,'' said Lawrence S. Prager, chief analyst
and strategist at Nikko Securites Co. ``It's just a slowdown.''

<HEAD>Government Seeks $10 Billion from Electricity Sale</HEAD>

   The government said Wednesday it hopes to raise
$10.2 billion in the first stage of its electricity industry
sell-off, its biggest and most complex privatization in the last 10
years.
   Twenty percent of the 2.16 billion shares being sold will be
offered to foreign investors. The shares will sell for for 240
pence ($4.73) each, or a total 5.18 billion pounds, the government
said.
   The offering caps Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's huge
privatization program, which already has raised $65 billion, or 33
billion pounds, through the sales of Britain's telephone, gas and
water utilities and such companies as British Airways PLC.
   The sales are intended to create efficient, competitive
companies and encourage wider ownership of those companies.
   There has been some nervousness about how successful the recent
privatizations will be, with a nervous stock market, the continuing
Middle East crisis and the current struggle for leadership within
Britain's governing Conservative Party.
   Investors also remember the sale of the government's one-third
stake in British Petroleum Co. PLC, which flopped because it
coincided with the October 1987 stock market crash.
   But Energy Secretary John Wakeham said 7.3 million people have
registered an interest in buying the electric utility shares,
second only to the record 7.5 million registrations for British Gas
PLC.
   ``I don't see any signs of any serious effects on the stock
market or sterling as a result of the election for leadership,''
Wakeham said, referring to Thatcher's failure this week to defeat
Michael Heseltine for the leadership of the Conservative Party.
Another vote will be held next week.
   The government also has calmed jitters about the offering by
announcing it would scrap the sale if war broke out in the Persian
Gulf.
   ``There is no major risk. I think in today's market conditions
the offer will be a success,'' said Chris Rowland, an electricity
analyst with the London investment firm Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd.
   The government on Wednesday signaled its confidence by going
ahead and selling 100 percent of each of the 12 regional
electricity companies of England and Wales. It had been considering
scaling the offer back to 60 percent if market conditions were
poor.
   ``This is the first step in meeting the government's objective
of privatizing the electricity industry within the lifetime of this
parliament,'' Wakeham said.
   The government plans to sell its two electricity generating
companies and the Scottish electricity industry next year. The
shares are expected to fetch a 20 percent premium when trading
starts Dec. 11. The application deadline is Dec. 5.
   Shareholders are to receive an average 8.4 percent dividend
return in the first year, Wakeham said.
   The government has sought to enhance the sale with an
installment payment plan of nearly two years, the longest ever, and
with bonus shares and discounts on electricity bills, types of
perks it has offered in the past.
   Rowland described the price as ``attractive,'' but opposition
lawmaker Frank Dobson, the Labor party's spokesman on energy
matters, attacked the price as overly cheap. He accused the
government of selling 16 billion pounds ($32 billion) of assets for
$5 billion pounds ($10 billion).
   The government said at least 34 percent of the shares will be
reserved for the general public in Britain, and the remaining 46
percent will go to British institutional investors.
   If there is heavy British demand for the shares, the 20 percent
offering to foreign investors will be scaled back, the government
said.

<HEAD>Proposed Courtroom Channels Plan to Merge</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The backers of two proposed cable television
channels devoted to covering the legal system have decided to
cooperate on a single courtroom network, avoiding what could have
been a costly competition.
   The Courtroom Television Network is expected to be launched next
summer.
   Time Warner Inc., which hoped to launch its own courtroom
network next year, and National Broadcasting Co. and the
programming division of Cablevision Systems Corp., which were
developing a similar service, said Wednesday they agreed to form a
partnership to create a channel devoted exclusively to coverage of
the courts and legal issues.
   Terms were not disclosed. The deal is subject to approval by
their respective boards.
   The plan calls for Time Warner to manage the new service through
its affiliate American Lawyer Media LP, which publishes 11 legal
titles including the monthly American Lawyer magazine. American
Lawyer president and chief executive, Steven Brill, will be chief
executive of the joint cable venture.
   The Courtroom Television Network will provide continuous live
and taped coverage of trials, legal reports and commentary from
legal experts.
   Its backers say there is a big audience for television that
focuses on legal issues.
   But planners of the competing services found many cable TV
systems simply didn't have extra channel space for two legal
networks and were slow in picking between them. A tight capital
market, meanwhile, has made it more difficult for operators to
raise money for expansion of channel capacity.
   ``The operators are, as a result, prudent and cautious in adding
new services,'' said Sharon Patrick, president of Cablevision's
Rainbow Programming Holdings Inc. ``But we feel that combining the
distribution, the capital and the talent of the two of them creates
the strongest new service in cable.''
   Time Warner owns cable operations with an estimated 6.4 million
household subscribers, while Cablevision Systems has about 1.6
million subscribers.
   Discussions are underway with other cable systems about taking
the courtroom channel.
   Cablevision Systems had originally planned to have its courtroom
cable network, called In Court, in operation this fall. It hired
Arthur Miller, the Harvard law professor, as its chief legal
analyst and a staff of about 15 to 20 other people, Ms. Patrick
said.
   Time Warner has never disclosed a proposed launch date for its
courtroom service, which was tentatively called The American
Courtroom Network.
   It hired Fred Graham, formerly the Supreme Court reporter for
the New York Times and CBS News, as its chief anchor.
   Graham will take that role on the proposed network and Miller,
Floyd Abrams, F. Lee Bailey, David Boies, Robert Bork, Arthur Liman
and Barry Slotnick will serves as commentators. The network will
also draw on work from American Lawyer's more than 200 legal
journalists.
   Larry Gerbrandt, who follows the cable industry for Paul Kagan
Associates in Carmel, Calif., said the combination of the two
proposed legal channels makes it more likely that a courtroom
channel will succeed.
   ``This is not an environment where either Time Warner or
Cablevision wants to sustain long-term losses. Combined, this
network has a chance to launch much faster, be larger and be more
profitable more quickly,'' he said.
   He noted that two cable comedy channels, for instance, were
launched in the past year but neither has approached the 25 million
subscribers he says are needed to attract advertisers and generate
sufficient licensing fees to cover overhead costs. About 54 million
U.S. households get cable TV.
   Time Warner's Comedy Channel, launched in November 1989, is on
systems with 7.5 million subscribers while Viacom Inc.'s Ha!
channel has 6.5 million.
   Talks about merging those services broke off earlier this year.
   ``The comedy wars have been plenty expensive,'' Gerbrandt said.
   He agreed there may be an appetite for a legal channel.
   ``It's America's ultimate ongoing theater,'' he said.

<HEAD>Nation's Seventh-Largest Accounting Firm Files For Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawsuits seeking tens of millions of dollars in
damages and challenging Laventhol &amp; Horwath's audits have put the
nation's seventh-largest accounting firm in bankruptcy court.
   Laventhol Wednesday filed under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy
laws, which allows a company to continue operating while it
reorganizes and pays creditors. But the Philadelphia-based
accounting firm said its name was so tarnished by the filing that
it cannot keep operating on its own.
   Instead, many of Laventhol's 318 partners plan to open
independent offices in cities where the firm operated. These
offices would attempt to retain Laventhol clients and funnel income
to the parent company, allowing it to pay its debts, according to
the filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.
   In addition, Laventhol partners that find work at other firms
would continue to service Laventhol accounts under the plan.
   Laventhol, which said earlier this week it would be forced to
take the step, said the bankruptcy filing was prompted in part by
the cost of settling or defending itself against more than 100
lawsuits seeking tens of millions of dollars in damages.
   The suits primarily were initiated by clients challenging
Laventhol audits or by shareholders of client companies claiming
Laventhol provided faulty financial information.
   Michael Crames, a New York-based lawyer for Laventhol, said the
plan was novel and that it provides the best chance for creditors
to be repaid.
   Laventhol said the court must suspend the lawsuits it faces in
order for the plan to work. Laventhol received a temporary
injunction Wednesday halting the suits and plans to seek a
permanent bar at a Dec. 4 hearing before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Cornelius Blackshear, Crames said.
   During the bankruptcy case, Laventhol will attempt to determine
its total liaiblities, including claims made in lawsuits, he said.
Crames said he could not estimate what those liabilities would be.
   In its bankruptcy filing, Laventhol said it owed $146 million to
various creditors. Its two largest are Chase Manhattan Bank and
Fidelity Bank, which are owed $85 million, Crames said. But its
actual liabilities will be much higher, he said.
   Laventhol, which had 50 offices nationwide, said most of its
annual income came in the tax season of January-April. These banks
provided credit that helped Laventhol meet its cash needs the rest
of the year.
   Laventhol also faces a lawsuit over its auditing of Jim Bakker's
PTL ministry. That case is on trial in Charlotte, N.C.
   Since Laventhol is a partnership, not a corporation, its current
and even retired partners could end up paying out of their own
pockets to settle claims if Laventhol can't come up with enough
money.
   ``Partners may find themselves on the hook'' for work that the
firm did while they were employed there, Crames said.
   Laventhol said it thinned its payroll as it entered its credit
crunch, leaving about 3,200 employees in addition to the partners
and principals as of this month. It had domestic revenue of $350
million last year.
   Laventhol also said it sought to merge with several other major
accounting firms but had no offers.

<HEAD>Economic Factors Prove To Be Thatcher's Downfall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Economic factors contributed to Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's downfall, though reforming the economy was one
of the hallmarks of more than 11 years of Thatcherism.
   During her tenure at 10 Downing St., Mrs. Thatcher relentlessly
promoted capitalism to defeat socialism in Britain.
   She took over from the previous, Labor government a troubled
economy that was suffering from 17 percent interest rates and moved
deep into recession while inflation climbed to 18 percent.
   Mrs. Thatcher tamed militant labor unions, reformed taxes and
cut many inefficiencies out of British industry. Her efforts helped
produce an eight-year economic boom - the longest in Britain since
World War II - during which interest rates fell to 7.5 percent,
inflation got down to 3.3 percent and unemployment went from 11.3
percent to 5.5 percent.
   But her hostility toward European economic and monetary union,
her unpopular per-capita community charge or ``poll-tax,'' and the
downturn in the economy made her vulnerable to the attack on her
leadership of the Conservative Party.
   To guard British sovereignty, she said she wouldn't abolish the
pound to make way for a single European currency, or relinquish
monetary control to a European central bank. But other
Conservatives and many Britons worried about being left behind in
the European economic revolution.
   The poll tax, which went into effect earlier this year, was
unpopular enough to also divide her party and spark riots.
   The tax was intended to make local government authorities
accountable for their spending, but it condemned for having no
relationship to the taxpayer's ability to pay.
   The economic downturn has been accompanied by 14 percent
interest rates, 10.9 percent inflation, and huge trade deficits.
Unemployment, at 6 percent, has been climbing.
   The government had pushed interest rates higher, leaving them at
15 percent for a year, to fight the resurgent inflation by cooling
demand.
   Demand had overheated because of loose monetary policy designed
to improve the Conservatives' electoral prospects in 1987 and to
avoid a recession following the stock market crash in October of
that year.
   High interest rates have hurt industry and profits, and Britain
is suffering record business failures. The rates also have squeezed
Britain's new homeowners, who generally hold adjustable rate
mortgages.
   The persistent bear market on the stock exchange, meanwhile, has
hurt some 9 million Britons who have become new shareholders.
   Asked about Mrs. Thatcher's accomplishments, economist Kevin
Darlington of the London investment firm UBS Phillips and Drew
said, ``The true test will be whether the underlying economy is
strong enough to cope with the current recession.''
   Mrs. Thatcher said in the House of Commons Thursday that her
government had improved the standard of living in Britain.
   This past week she said that one of her main achievements was
creating a culture of enterprise that oversaw the restructuring of
Britain's overmanned, inefficient industry into a leaner, more
competitive one.
   ``The major accomplishment, I think, must be the enormous surge
in British productivity, the change in management attitudes - she
got rid of slack management - and the weakening of union power,''
said John Barnes, who teaches government at the London School of
Economics.
   ``At least part of the 11 12 years in office she succeeded in
beating inflation,'' Barnes said. The generation of small business
was also a Thatcher accomplishment, he said.
   Through large-scale privatization that has been copied around
the world, Mrs. Thatcher deregulated utilities, turned nationalized
companies such as British Airways into world-class competitors, and
more than tripled British share ownership.
   Britain's financial markets also were deregulated under the
so-called Big Bang, which opened securities trading to banks and
foreign traders in 1986.
   She tamed Britain's militant unions with legislation that
required them to ballot workers before they go on strike, and union
membership has declined substantially, to 8.4 million from 12
million in 1979.
   Mrs. Thatcher also promoted home ownership by selling public
housing to its tenants.
   She cut and simplified taxes. Over the years she brought the
basic income tax rate to 25 percent from 33 percent, and nearly
halved the top rate to 40 percent from 83 percent.
   She put a tight grip on public spending, and tried to break a
British dependence on welfare. Thus she turned the budget deficits
into the surpluses.
   The prime minister also encouraged entrepreneurship, trying to
turn Britain from a class-divided society into a meritocracy. Some
400,000 new businesses have been created since 1979, she said.

   The dollar closed lower Thursday on European
currency exchanges that were dominated by news that British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher had resigned.
   Gold prices were higher.
   Currency dealers said the British pound fell briefly, but
quickly rebounded after the announcement to close above Wednesday's
rate. U.S. markets were closed for the Thanksgiving holiday.
   At the close in London, the pound stood at $1.970 dollars, up
from Wednesday's close of $1.968.
   Dealers said the pound was strengthened by the feeling that
whoever succeeds Mrs. Thatcher will unify the business-oriented
Conservative Party in time to win the next general election, which
must be called by mid 1992.
   Other late European dollar rates, compared with late Wednesday's
rates, were: 1.4785 German marks, down from 1.4815; 1.2490 Swiss
francs, down from 1.2505; 4.9890 French francs, down from 5.0000;
1.6670 Dutch guilders, down from 1.6717; 1,109.50 Italian lire,
down from 1,112.75; and 1.1602 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1587.
   In earlier Tokyo trading, the dollar eased to 127.13 Japanese
yen, down from 127.68. In London late Thursday the dollar traded
higher at 127.25 yen.
   Gold closed in London at a bid of $380.00 a troy ounce, up from
Wednesday's closing $378.25. The late bid price in Zurich was
$380.50, up from $378.50.
   Traders said there was little movement in the gold price because
of a lack of buying interest.
   Earlier in Hong Kong gold had closed at $380.44 bid, up from
$372.13.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid of $4.13 a troy
ounce, up from $4.11.

   The Stock Exchange closed slightly higher Thursday
after a session that stayed erratic following news of Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's resignation.
   The initial announcement pushed the main index up more than 34
points on optimism that Mrs. Thatcher's departure would improve the
Conservative Party's electoral chances.
   But shares prices fell back after more than one new contender
emerged.
   Traders said the market was still more assured that the
Conservatives would be able to unite and win the next general
election, which must be called by mid-1992.
   However, the overriding sentiment was that there was little
point investing in the market when the leadership of the government
remained undecided.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed up 1.6
points, or 0.08 percent, at 2,127.9.
   The session high of 2,160.7, a gain of 34.4 points, came
immediately after the news of Mrs. Thatcher's resignation.
   The Financial Times 30-share index finished at 1,672.2, down 3.8
points. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 1.56 points to
close at 1,124.29.
   Volume was 498.2 million shares, up slightly from 444.5 million

<HEAD>Thatcher's Resignation Is Bittersweet News For British Business</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's resignation
Thursday was bittersweet news for Britain's business community and
financial markets.
   They were sorry to see Mrs. Thatcher go because her staunch
free-market policies have transformed British industry during her
11{ years in power.
   But they were relieved that she stepped aside to improve the
capitalist Conservative Party's chances of defeating the socialist
Laborites in the next election, which must be called by mid-1992.
   They were dismayed that more than one new leadership contender
stepped forward, raising doubts about the Conservative election
changes, and fueling fears that the leadership battle would be
prolonged.
   Some traders were cheered that Chancellor of the Exchequer John
Major was one of two new candidates, believing the Treasury's top
official could help turn Britain's ailing economy turn around.
   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd also said he would challenge
Michael Hesletine, the former defense minister who won enough votes
last Tuesday to force a second ballot next Tuesday and prompt Mrs.
Thatcher to step down.
   Traders said Mrs. Thatcher's announcement caught the financial
community, like most everyone else, off-guard, especially after her
determined statement Wednesday that she would fight on.
   But Kevin Darlington, a British economist with the London
investment firm UBS Phillips and Drew, said: ``There was not the
kind of fallout in the stock market or sterling that might have
been expected because the worst already has been anticipated.''
   The pound and share prices soared when news of her resignation
broke in the morning, then fell back after Hurd and Major emerged
before the noon deadline for nominations.
   ``The market is going mad in relief,'' said Peter Furlong,
senior British equities dealer at Daiwa Securities.
   One buoyant factor during the day was widespread speculation
that the Conservative government would launch the new post-Thatcher
regime with a quick, half-point cut in Britain's 14 percent
interest rates.
   The strong pound would allow an interest rate cut without
risking sterling's position in the European exchange rate
mechanism, which links European currencies and limits exchange rate
swings.
   ``The decision to cut base rates has almost certainly been taken
already,'' said Steven Bell, senior economist at Morgan Grenfell
and Co.
   The pound finished the day at $1.9695, after rising as high as
$1.98. It closed at $1.9680 Wednesday.
   The British currency also finished at 2.9118 German marks after
rocketing to 2.9315 marks. The Wednesday late rate was 2.9122
marks.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished 1.6
points, or 0.08 percent, higher at 2,127.9. The session high, which
came right after the resignation news, was 2,160.7, a gain of 34.4
points.
   Andrew Ellott, a corporate dealer with Chase Manhattan Bank in
London, said ``The market was optimistic about the next election
when Thatcher resigned.
   ``Then we had two new people come into the election who in my
view are Mrs. Thatcher's proteges. I think that will very much
split the vote with Heseltine.''
   Darlington said: ``There will be enormous uncertainty over the
next week. It looks increasingly likely that it (the leadership
battle) will go to a third ballot next Thursday.
   ``One would expect a kind of paralysis to take hold'' in the
markets, he said.
   Some equities and foreign exchange traders predicted that the
financial markets' bullish reaction would be short-lived because
the markets longer-term wouldn't be able to ignore Britain's
underlying economic troubles.
   One analyst said ``the economic facts are still the same: the
economy isn't running smoothly, inflation is too high.''
   Inflation is running at 10.9 percent, although the economy is
shrinking.
   But the business community was quick to express its regrets at
Mrs. Thatcher's departure.
   Sir Brian Corby, president of the Confederation of British
Industry, said: ``British business today is unrecognizable in the
quality of its management, the revival of its investment in the
future and in its ability to compete in the toughest markets
throughout the world.
   ``Much of the credit for that historic turnaround belongs to the
prime minister,'' Corby said.
   British Midland Airways Chairman Michael Bishop said he was
extremely sorry about the resignation. Mrs. Thatcher had been ``the
catalyst'' which had helped his company expand, he said.

<TEXT>
   New owners of the exercise equipment
firm Nautilus are trying to muscle their way back from bankruptcy
court with a pitch to older folks that they can benefit from
pumping iron.
   ``We're going to go at the competition from a position of
strength and with a lot of new products,'' said Nautilus President
Dan Baldwin. Baldwin has returned to the company he helped founder
Arthur Jones build from 1974 to 1986.
   Travis Ward of Dallas bought the company in 198 for $38 million
and filed for bankruptcy protection in February after four years of
management turnovers and increasing debt and overhead.
   Retail sales of nearly $60 million in 1985 plummeted and the
work force of 600 that year dropped to 250 in 1990, Baldwin said.
   Baldwin, while not giving the exact amount, said sales of
Nautilus exercise machines have tripled since August, when he and a
group of well-financed investors bought the company in bankruptcy
court for $15 million.
   The company is designing weight machines for the elderly that
will be lighter and easier to get into and out of. And it is
expanding its focus to people over 45 whose concern is shifting
from their grown children to their own bodies.
   ``If we can just get the message across to these people. They
need more exercise than anyone else,'' said Baldwin, gray-haired
but trim at 57. ``Ronald Reagan is a good example of what
weightlifting can do.''
   Reagan used Nautilus equipment in the White House when he was
rehabilitating from his gunshot wound.
   Baldwin, who can still yank bank an entire stack on the curl
machine, personifies the push to beat the lull in the economy by
expanding the market base to middle-aged and elderly people.
   The privately held firm is negotiating to buy a company that
makes aerobic equipment such as treadmills, exercise bikes and
rowing machines, or enter a joint venture with one, Baldwin said.
   Industry experts credit Nautilus' second wind to its name
recognition and its reputation. They said the company helped
pioneer the movement that brought physical fitness out of the
locker room and into health clubs, hotels and office buildings.
   ``They are a symbol for the industry,'' Club Industry Magazine
publisher Marc Onigman said.
   Nautilus is trying to capitalize on its brand name by licensing
it for bottled water, sports apparel and a soft drink being
test-marketed by Dr Pepper.
   To help sell the new ideas, Baldwin has hired one of the world's
largest advertising agencies, Saatchi and Saatchi, and a Madison
Avenue public relations firm.
   ``Most companies come out of Chapter 11 very conservative,''
John Saunders, the vice president for sales and marketing said.
``This company is stronger today and better capitalized and better
managed than at any point in history.''
   The new line of weight machines with unique shielding to cover
moving parts was shown last week at a national trade show in
Chicago.
   ``People were pleasantly surprised by the presence Nautilus had
at the show,'' Onigman said. ``The message was clear: they're
coming back with a vengeance.''
   But Baldwin conceded that it has been more difficult than he
anticipated to rehabilitate the company, which listed a debt of
$38.6 million and assets of $27.3 million when it filed for
reorganization in bankruptcy court.
   Baldwin declined to say what the company's debt and assets are
now.
   A New York market research firm, FIND-SVP, puts industry sales
at about $250 million this year. In 1988, the research firm
estimated that Universal Gym was the industry leader with sales of
$30 million and Nautilus was second at $20 million.
   Onigman said the fitness industry, leery of the recession, is
watching closely to see if Nautilus can regain its former strength.
   ``There are a lot of disciples of Nautilus out there,'' he said.
``Nobody likes to see a hero fall, even people that compete with
Nautilus.''

<HEAD>Ski Industry Brings Out New Technology To Avoid Economic Ruts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Barren slopes in Europe and slowing traffic at
U.S. resorts have put a chill in ski equipment sales, and
manufacturers face another potential rut in the soggy economy,
industry officials say.
   ``I think everybody is concerned,'' said David Ingemie,
president of United Ski Industries Association, a group
representing resorts and manufacturers. ``In the past, the ski
industry has been recession resistant, but you're never sure.''
   Even before this year's season opened, ski makers saw an inside
threat, as industry giant Salomon S.A. - a powerful force in
bindings and boots - edged into the market with a new line of skis.
   Combined with the slower business, it helped fuel a stir in the
ski industry, which is offering all sorts of bargains and high-tech
equipment to bring more people into the port.
   Figures compiled by the ski association reflect the sluggish
times facing the industry. In the 1989-90 season, U.S. resorts
recorded 50 million skier visits, a 6 percent drop from the year
before. Prior to then, skier traffic had been flat for a couple of
years.
   Officials say the situation has been more bleak in Europe, which
has been plagued by little snowfall.
   Also, the drop off at ski lift lines has had a ripple effect in
the equipment industry.
   ``If fewer people are going out skiing, they will tend to
purchase less equipment,'' said Marvin Kottke, a retired University
of Connecticut economist who conducts annual studies of the ski
industry.
   U.S. equipment sales increased last season by 2 percent to $675
million, but industry experts say that was explained by higher
prices. The number of skis sold, for example, declined by 3 percent
to 1.1 million pairs.
   This year, the equipment industry is bracing for another threat
in the sagging U.S. economy. The economic troubles have hit
particularly hard in New England, home to many major resorts.
Still, ski area operators are optimistic, saying their biggest
concern is not the economy but the weather.
   At the retail level, die-hard skiers will still buy new
equipment, which can cost up to several hundred dollars, said Chris
Leake, vice president of merchandising for Ski Market Ltd., which
operates a chain of stores in the Northeast.
   ``But most people are saying, `I think I'll make my boots last
another year. I'll make my skis work another season,''' he said.
   ``I think it would be crazy to think the lack of confidence in
the economy has no impact on the ski business,'' said Stuart
Rempel, a marketing and communications executive for Salomon's U.S.
headquarters in Georgetown, which is about 30 miles from Boston.
   Nonetheless, Salomon, based in France, has introduced a ski this
year that the company spent five years and $40 million to develop.
Rempel said the ski has a unique design that gives skiers more
control and more speed.
   The new line is targeted for top-level skiers, and the company
is making no concessions to what might be a tight market. Each pair
of its skis will cost a whopping $595.
   That high price could cause some problems, given the current
economic slump, Leake said.
   ``Potentially, Salomon's timing is poor,'' he said, but added:
``They've made a major commitment. Salomon isn't making skis for
one year.''
   In fact, Salomon plans to introduce a lower level of
recreational skis next year, Rempel said. ``Our intention is to be
a major force in skis,'' he said.
   This strategy is not lost on other ski makers. Salomon already
dominates the world market in bindings, with a 45 percent share,
according to Rempel's estimates, and is vying for the top spot in
boots.
   ``If I was a competitor, I'd be nervous,'' said Ingemie at the
ski industries association.
   Rossignol S.A., a world leader in the ski market, has come out
with its own new skis this year, which also incorporate significant
technological improvements to make turning easier, said
Jeanne-Marie Gand, a company spokeswoman.
   ``You can't sit back on your laurels,'' she said, adding that
the French company next year will introduce another ``incredible''
line of skis.
   Still, she said companies are working harder to make skiing a
``viable activity'' for people facing tight budgets. Some resorts
are offering special family rates and free skiing for beginners to
attract more people.
   Rossignol is working with some resorts and retailers to offer
customers free lift tickets if they buy a pair of skis.
   ``We see much more of that this year,'' she said.

   Avon has come calling with a Chinese-style sales
approach for its beauty supplies.
   Instead of knocking on doors in the American tradition, Avon
salespeople in China will use the time-hallowed Chinese custom of
working through personal contacts.
   The first selling job Avon faced in China was with Chinese
officials, according to John Novosad, vice president for the
Asia-Pacific region of Avon Products Inc.
   ``The first thing we heard was, `What's direct selling?'''
Novosad said Wednesday in a telephone interview from his Hong Kong
office. ``They had great difficulty understanding why we thought
this was a good idea. But we convinced them.''
   Avon, through a joint venture with the Guangzhou Cosmetics
Factory, then began selling beauty products this month in the
southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, also known as Canton. The
company has 25 sales supervisors, all Chinese, who have recruited
about 800 people to sell the beauty supplies on a commission basis,
Novosad said.
   ``We expected to have to spend a lot of time teaching these
people about profit incentive and the selling methods,'' Novosad
said. ``You're talking about a country that we all believe doesn't
know about these things. Well, it wasn't that way. The first
question we heard was, `How much commission do I get?'''
   Avon, which already sells its products in more than 100
countries, is selling skin-care supplies, perfumes, cosmetics and
personal hygiene items in China. They will be made in China with
imported ingredients.
   The company's traditional image in the United States is of an
``Avon lady'' ringing doorbells and spending leisurely afternoons
with her customers.
   ``Here, we're telling the representatives to build networks,
talk to their sisters, talk to those they work with and so on.
There are no limits, so it can be done door-to-door if they feel
comfortable, or it can be done by taking brochures to work. It
depends on the ingenuity.''
   Novosad said Avon will test the method in Guangzhou before
trying other parts of China.
   Avon supervisors receive a base salary, but also get a 2 percent
to 6 percent commission on the sales of the representatives they
recruit, Novosad said. The salespeople will receive a 25 percent
commission on their sales, he said.
   ``We think it will work here and let us develop a base for all
of China. China, once it gets economically going, will be a
fabulous market of tremendous proportions,'' Novosad said. ``We
don't expect to make millions at first.''
   Prices for the Avon products sold in Guangzhou average about $3.
That's one-tenth the average monthly income of a Chinese worker,
but Guangzhou workers are generally better off than those elsewhere
in the country. Customers are most likely to be single young women,
who tend to have relatively high disposable incomes.

   Kevin Paxton has worked at the Teledyne CAE
plant for more than 10 years. He says he was a company man who took
pride in his work as a tool and die maker.
   But when the 35-year-old father of two thinks of Teledyne these
days, he feels mostly anger and bitterness over a 10-month strike
that has cast a pall over the holiday season.
   ``You do a good job for the company and you want to continue on,
but they seem like they just don't care. That hurts. I mean I feel
like my legs have been kicked out from under me,'' Paxton said
Wednesday.
   A local grocery store gave away more than 100 turkeys this week
to the striking employees to help them through Thanksgiving.
   Local 12, which also represents workers at the Toledo Jeep
plants, has started a program called ``Adopt a Teledyne Family.''
Union members are being encouraged to give presents and other help
to Teledyne families with children.
   Paxton said most of the 130 members of United Auto Workers Local
12 who went on strike in February feel that the walkout has gone on
for too long. Teledyne hourly employees walked off the job after
working eight months without a contract at the manufacturer of
engines that power military missiles.
   A federal mediator is involved, but no new talks have been
scheduled and the company has hired some replacement workers.
   A telephone message that a reporter left at the company's
offices was not immediately returned.
   Workers at four other Teledyne plants in the United States also
are on strike.
   David Bosworth, president of the union's Teledyne unit, said the
union wants the company to continue paying health insurance to
employees after they retire.
   In addition, Teledyne wants to cap cost of living increases for
workers, who earn $13.50 an hour. It also is seeking job
description changes that would allow some positions to be combined.
   Union members receive $100 a week in strike pay. Some members
have wives who work; others have had to dip into their savings to
support their families.
   ``I know of families that are hurting real bad. Members of this
unit never expected to be on strike this long. I thought we'd have
it over by now,'' Bosworth said.
   The mood was somber at a meeting Wednesday, where workers
listened to the latest news about the strike and picked up food
donated by other unions.
   ``I wish I had some good news, but I don't have any,'' Bosworth
told more than 100 workers.

<HEAD>U.S., Europe, Japan Agree on Advanced Manufacturing Technology
Project</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan, the United States and Europe have laid the
groundwork for a joint development of ``intelligent'' future
manufacturing technologies, negotiators said.
   ``This is the first time that this many countries have been
represented ... in discussions about advanced manufacturing and how
they can collaborate,'' a U.S. negotiator said. ``We're very
pleased with the amount of progress we made.''
   As proposed by Japan, the project would develop and set
standards for future technologies such as computer-controlled
flexible factories that could shift products with a simple change
in software programs.
   A lack of standards in such technologies would make competition
among suppliers difficult and complicate procurement for
manufacturers, especially at overseas plants.
   The three sides agreed in talks this week in Tokyo on basic
principles for the project, called the Intelligent Manufacturing
System, but did not set any concrete plans, the officials said.
   U.S. officials said they now will explain the outcome of the
talks to American industry and seek its consensus on how to
proceed.
   ``If it is the feeling of industry to go ahead, the next step
would be to actually negotiate an agreement for the first phase''
of the program, said a member of the U.S. delegation, who briefed
reporters on condition of anonymity.
   Japan originated the project, and offered to fund about 60
percent of its cost, partly in response to charges that it has used
foreign technology but contributed too little to world scientific
knowledge. More than 80 Japanese companies and a number of American
firms have expressed interest in the program.
   But at a meeting in May, U.S. and European officials balked at
adopting Japan's plan and demanded that preparation and control of
the project be shared. Some U.S. business and government officials
also accused Japan of planning to use the project to acquire U.S.
technology and dominate future global manufacturing.
   ``The degree of skepticism has been reduced as a result of the
dialogue,'' the U.S. official said. He said most U.S. proposals
were accepted by Japan and the European Community during the
two-day discussions, which ended Tuesday.
   ``The United States, Europe and Japan each have different
strengths. If we select themes that will be of benefit to each of
the participants, the result can be satisfactory to all,'' said
Katsujiro Kida, director of the Industrial Machinery Division of
Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
   ``By advancing manufacturing technology, this will create a body
of knowledge that will profit all humankind,'' he said.
   The U.S. official said it was unfortunate that American industry
waited until Japan took the initiative in calling for research in
manufacturing technologies, ``but we should take advantage of this
opportunity.''
   U.S. negotiators said they see the project as a broad umbrella
under which many groups of researchers can work on a variety of
projects.
   Although research topics have not been selected, Japanese
officials envision standardized technologies that would allow
factory computers and robots to communicate much more extensively.
Factory machines would be linked directly with sales offices, parts
suppliers and accounting departments.
   An order entered in an auto dealer's computer, for example,
could automatically instruct computers at parts suppliers and
