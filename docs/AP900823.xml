   Nine inmates were hospitalized briefly and
more than 100 became ill after lunch Wednesday at John Lilley
Correctional Center, state Corrections department officials said.
   ``We suspect the chicken salad,'' state Corrections spokesman
Jerry Massie said.
   All inmates were back in their quarters by Wednesday night.
   At the height of the outbreak, 114 inmates were being treated.
Prison officials sent some to the hospital infirmary, and set up a
temporary infirmary to handle the patient overflow.
   ``They were obviously ill. It was obvious they were real sick,''
warden's aide Linda Parrish said.
   ``There wasn't any panic,'' Ms. Parrish said. `They were just
reporting to medical with symptoms of nausea and vomiting, and some
with diarrhea.''
   The most seriously ill inmates were taken to the emergency room
of the Creek Nation Hospital in Okemah.
   Prison officials called in off-duty staff to help out. Security
wasn't threatened, Ms. Parrish said.
   Results of tests conducted on the prison's food should be out by
early next week, said health department worker Ron Spencer.
   Lunch featured the chicken salad, vegetable soup and chocolate
cake.
   That the chicken salad was to blame was only a guess on prison
officials' part, Ms. Parrish said: ``You always think, oh, it's the
mayonnaise.''

<TEXT>
   Mills College, which made headlines in
the spring with a determined fight to keep its undergraduate ranks
all female, has reopened with the largest enrollment in years.
   By the time registration is completed in three weeks, the
138-year-old school expects to have at least 814 undergraduate
students, up from 777 last year.
   Administrators said it will take 1,000 undergraduates a year to
cure the institution's money problems, which prompted school
officials to consider admitting men. Mills allows males in its
graduate program.
   A new event was added to the opening day routine on Tuesday. A
videotape was shown of the student strike three months ago that
ultimately convinced administrators to reverse their vote and agree
to keep men out.
   ``We're going to show this every year,'' said senior Anna
Stravato, a spokeswoman during the strike. ``We wanted to create a
timeless memento for each incoming class. We need to communicate to
them what it takes to be a Mills woman.''

   Glass debris in Columbia's fuel line
contributed to the shuttle's hydrogen leak, but the plumbing was
flushed out and the craft is on track for liftoff Sept. 1, NASA
says.
   The leak had frustrated NASA for months and kept the shuttle
grounded along with its $150 million Astro observatory.
   About 100 to 200 glass beads as fine as sand were found along
with metal chips when the seals in a 17-inch-diameter valve were
taken apart, William Lenoir, head of NASA's space flight program,
said Wednesday.
   The valve connects the orbiter and its big external fuel tank.
   ``There's not much question in our minds that that's implicated
in why did the ... seals leak,'' Lenoir said.
   However, he said officials haven't pinned down the precise cause
of the leak. The seals might also have been improperly installed,
he said.
   NASA officials said they do not know how the debris got there.
   Parker Hannifin Corp., which makes the plumbing connections, was
using the beads for other projects in the building where it was
making the shuttle parts, Lenoir said. The beads are used for
polishing and other tasks, he said.
   NASA plans no action against the company and will adopt more
rigorous test procedures to prevent similar problems, Lenoir said.
   The plumbing was flushed out with helium, he said. ``We've
looked for contamination. We don't see any,'' Lenoir said.
   Workers on Wednesday replaced part of a faulty valve on one of
Columbia's three main engines, a problem not related to the fuel
leak, Lenoir said.
   ``We're comfortable with the hardware we have on the pad,''
Lenoir said.
   NASA scrubbed its attempt to launch Columbia on May 30 when
hydrogen leaks were detected during fueling. Atlantis also was
found to have a hydrogen leak, but in a different spot, and the
entire shuttle fleet was briefly grounded.
   During the nine- to 10-day mission, Columbia's seven-member crew
will operate the Astro observatory from the shuttle, studying
ultraviolet light and X-rays from stars, supernovas and other
celestial bodies.

<HEAD>Study: House-Dust Mites Cause Childhood Asthma</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidly built houses that hold in heat may raise
the risk of childhood asthma by increasing exposure to dust mites,
a study today concludes.
   ``Has the modern world gone wrong about house design somewhere
so we are doing something to make houses more of a risk to
children?'' asked Dr. Thomas A.E. Platts-Mills.
   His research found that house-dust mites appear to be an
important contributor to asthma in places with humid year-round
climates. In a survey in England's soggy south, doctors discovered
that babies who lived in homes with high levels of the bugs had an
especially high risk of asthma as they grew older.
   In house construction, Platts-Mills said, ``the critical
offenses are carpets, central heating and tight housing. If you put
these three together, you raise the temperature. And if you
increases the tightness of the house without dehumidification, you
raise humidity and create ideal conditions for microbes.''
   The work supports the growing belief that a variety of proteins
from common household creatures, especially cats and cockroaches,
can trigger asthma.
   Platts-Mills, a researcher at the University of Virginia, is a
co-author of the study published in the New England Journal of
Medicine.
   He said that between 4 percent and 8 percent of Americans
youngsters have asthma. The problem tends to go away as people get
older, but it can remain a lifelong problem.
   His study was based on a survey of 67 children in Poole,
England. Researchers check for house-dust mites by testing samples
of dust from their homes.
   By age 11, 17 children had asthma. All but one had been exposed
to high levels of house-dust mites at age 1.
   The tiny mites are an unseen but common inhabitants of houses
everywhere. They are especially common in places with humid
year-round climates. Platts-Mills said that places in the United
States where they are likely to be a problem include such areas as
Florida, Seattle and Galveston, Texas.
   In the study, children ran a higher risk of asthma if the house
dust in their homes contained 500 or more mites per gram. However,
houses can have high levels of mites and still look perfectly clean.
   Children whose asthma is triggered by house-dust mites are
allergic to a protein found in the mites' gastrointestinal tracts
and droppings.
   Wall-to-wall carpeting is an especially cozy breeding ground for
mites, Platts-Milles said. Vacuuming fails to pick up the bugs and
their droppings. Shampooing the rugs aggravates the problem by
increasing dampness.
   He offered these tips for holding down levels of the creatures:
   _Wash blankets and pillows every 10 days.
   _Use hot water in washing. Avoid cold-water detergents, which
fail to kill the mites.
   _Use air conditioning and dehumidifiers to keep humidity below
50 percent.
   _Don't vacuum rugs when children are in the room, because this
stirs up the mites.

<TEXT>
   A man who videotaped his violent sexual encounter
with a woman at his apartment was convicted Wednesday of aggravated
sexual assault.
   Timothy Kehoe faces a possible sentence of life in prison and a
fine of up to $10,000. But defense attorneys have asked for a
minimum prison sentence of 15 years, saying that Kehoe can be
punished and rehabilitated at the same time.
   Jurors in State District Judge Larry Baraka's court on Tuesday
cringed as they watched a 72-minute videotape of Kehoe beating the
25-year-old woman into submission and forcing her to perform
various sex acts.
   The woman told police that she met Kehoe April 28 at a bar and
agreed to accompany him to his North Dallas apartment.
   The woman told police that Kehoe ordered her to take ``an
unknown white pill.'' He then set up a videotape camera in the
bedroom, the woman testified.
   When the woman tried to run, Kehoe punched her several times in
the face, she told police, then repeatedly raped her. She said she
finally escaped when another man knocked at the front door and
Kehoe went to answer it.
   The jury was scheduled to continue deliberating on the sentence
Thursday.

<HEAD>A Look at U.S. Military Reserves</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Gulf-Bush, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are some questions and answers about the military reserves:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>What Are the Reserves?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The reserves are made up of the Army Reserve, the Naval Reserve,
the Air Force Reserve, the Marine Corps Reserve, the Army National
Guard and the Air Force National Guard.
   National Guard units have a dual role. Guard troops serve as a
state militia under the command of governors, but come under
federal jurisdiction if called up by the president.
   Members of the Guard and Reserves attend regular meetings in
their home communities and spend two weeks on active duty each
year. Most guard units are trained for combat; Reserve units
general serve in such support roles as supply, maintenance,
communications and medicine.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>How Many People Are in the Reserves?
   Budget documents estimate the size of the Army Reserve at
309,200 troops; the Naval Reserve, 153,400; the Air Force Reserve,
89,400; the Marine Corps Reserve, 44,000; the Army National Guard,
447,300; and the Air National Guard, 116,200.
   Short of declaring a national emergency, the president can
mobilize up to 200,000 reservists for as long as 180 days.
   </HEAD>
<HEAD>What Is the Role of the Reserves?
   More than half of the Army's combat forces and two-thirds of its
combat support and service support manpower are in the Army
National Guard and Army Reserve. Two-thirds of the Army's medical
capacity and three-fourths of its medical evacuation capacity are
provided by reservists.
   The Navy Reserve maintains 93 percent of naval cargo handling
battalions, and the Air Force relies on reserves to man 92 percent
of strategic interceptor aircraft in the continental United States
and two-thirds of its medical evacuation crews.
   </HEAD>
<HEAD>Are Their Civilian Jobs Protected?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Under federal law, reservists called out of civilian jobs must
be treated as any worker on an unpaid leave of absence. When they
return, their employers must give them back their jobs _ or jobs of
equal stature _ with full seniority. But a reservist's job can be
eliminated while he or she is away if the employer can show that
the cut would have been made anyway.
   Reservists receive military pay while on active duty. When they
return to their civilian jobs, they are due any increase in pay or
benefits that other workers received while they were gone.
   Though employers aren't required to provide medical benefits,
many allow reservists to continue coverage if they pay their own
premiums. Reservists who serve more than 30 days are covered by the
military's medical plan.

   Creditors seized their 7-foot grizzly bear, their
performing lions and horses. They were kicked out of motels and
forced to live on charity. Their two-year U.S. tour was canceled
after just 12 performances.
   After a 4{-month struggle, the Great Circus Bim Bom is bowing
out.
   The last 35 members of the Soviet troupe were flying home to
Leningrad this afternoon, their fares paid for by a promoter of the
rival Moscow Circus.
   Atlanta residents who opened up their homes and checkbooks to
the stranded performers gathered to bid them farewell on their
departure for New York Wednesday night from Atlanta's airport.
   The troupers, showing both bitterness and resignation, said they
hated to leave their circus in ruins but had little choice.
   ``All of our dreams are broken,'' said music director Boris
Rivchun. ``We have nothing.''
   Originally 115 members strong, the circus named for two
turn-of-the-century Russian clowns came to the United States in
March and signed a contract with International Showbusiness Inc., a
newly formed company in Clearwater, Fla.
   Organizers said the venture starting losing money because of
poor publicity. The circus moved to Atlanta, where its trucking
company is based, to regroup, only to be kicked out of a series of
motels for not paying bills. Finally, the tour was canceled May 9.
   The circus' 54 animals were seized by creditors and are being
held in New York.
   Steven E. Leber, a New York businessman who promotes the Moscow
Circus, said he paid about $50,000 to fly home the circus members
and take care of some of their financial problems. On July 6, the
circus filed for protection from its creditors under U.S.
bankruptcy laws.
   Leber said the troupers came to him in desperation.
   ``They were starving. Basically, they were out of money. They
were at the end of their rope,'' Leber said.
   ``My gesture of good will be misinterpreted ... that I'm trying
to get rid of my competition,'' he said. ``My competition is
Ringling Bros., successful circuses. This is a rundown circus.''
   Leber said he previously helped 27 other members of Bim Bom who
had gone to Las Vegas to return to the Soviet Union. Other Bim Bom
members are believed to have left the troupe to seek work in the
United States or Canada.

   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has triggered
an astonishing shift in the Arab world, none more so than the
Syrian alliance with the United States, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
   Before the Iraqis conquered Kuwait on Aug. 2, it was
inconceivable that Syrian President Hafez Assad would be seen
cooperating so openly with the United States, Israel's main ally.
   To be sure, Assad has been locked in an ideological feud with
Iraq's leader, Saddam Hussein, for more than a decade, and he
backed Iran in its eight-year war against Iraq.
   But for two decades, Assad has been one of the Arab world's
leading hard-liners, an anti-Western campaigner and an implacable
opponent of Israel.
   Since seizing power in 1970, Assad has repeatedly confronted the
United States on its peace initiatives in the Middle East.
   U.S. forces shelled Syrian positions in Lebanon in 1983 during
the American intervention in Beirut, and the Syrians were a major
factor in forcing the United States' withdrawal from that country.
   By sending troops to Saudi Arabia to join an Arab expeditionary
force confronting Iraq, Assad has come in from the cold.
   On Tuesday, Syria said it was sending troops to Saudi Arabia
because ``the (Persian) Gulf region should not be left to the
foreigners and ... Arab troops should replace the foreign forces
there.''
   Officials in Damascus said the Syrian contingent was not going
to Saudi Arabia to fight with the United States against Iraq, but
would act as a buffer between the two sides.
   Syria's realignment with Arab moderates has lent credibility to
the campaign led by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to cut Saddam
down to size.
   ``The presence ... of a Syrian contingent alongside the American
forces in Saudi Arabia must be counted as one of the strongest
cards in the hand of the Saudi-U.S.-Egyptian axis _ and as one of
the more outlandish spectacles to result from Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait,'' analyst Charles Snow wrote in the Middle East Economic
Survey.
   Syria is still on the U.S. list of countries that support
terrorism and Ahmed Jibril, leader of the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine-General Command is headquartered in
Damascus, the Syrian capital.
   That group is believed responsible for the December 1988 bombing
of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland in which 290 people were killed.
   The British, who have sent forces to Saudi Arabia, have also
been at odds with Assad. They broke off diplomatic relations in
1986 claiming Syria was involved in an abortive attempt to smuggle
a bomb aboard an Israeli jetliner at London.
   Assad's motives for joining the confrontation against Saddam may
be opportunistic as much as ideologlical.
   Apart from the prospect of helping humble his main Arab rival,
Assad is likely to demand a price for allying himself with the
United States and the conservative Saudi Arabian monarchy.
   The United States, aware of how much Assad's backing would
strengthen the Arab moderates, began courting Assad in early August.
   President Bush spoke with Assad by telephone on Aug. 12.
   Syria has also been inching back into the Arab mainstream over
the last year, propelled in part by superpower detente that has
seriously undercut the massive military support it once received
from Moscow.
   It is unclear what Assad's will demand in return for his support.
   It would be surprising if he did not try to exact a commitment
from Bush to press Israel to withdraw from the Golan Heights,
captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed several
years later.
   With Syria's economy in poor condition, Assad is also likely to
expect the United States and Saudi Arabia to reward him with hefty
amounts of financial aid.
   He would also like to see U.S. and Saudi backing for his
policies in Lebanon. Syria maintains 40,000 troops in Lebanon and
has declared that country vital to its defenses against against
Israel.

<HEAD>NEA Creating Special Panel to Investigate Obscenity Complaints</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Endowment for the Arts is
creating a special watchdog panel to investigate complaints from
``any reliable source'' that grant recipients are violating the law
by using federal funds to produce obscene art.
   Plans for the panel were disclosed in a letter from NEA general
counsel Julianne Ross Davis to the lawyer for the American Poetry
Review, a Philadelphia-based literary magazine that subsequently
rejected a $10,000 endowment grant over the obscenity issue.
   The three editors of the 24,000-circulation publication said
they found the NEA's obscenity guidelines ``restraining and
damaging to the process of selecting material for the magazine, as
well as to poets and writers.''
   Ms. Davis told the magazine in late July that the panel would
include herself, a deputy NEA chairman and program specialists in
theater, literature and other arts disciplines. The panel will
``make initial determinations with respect to allegations of
obscenity'' based on ``a complaint from any reliable source,'' she
said.
   Ms. Davis was unavailable for comment Wednesday, but NEA
spokeswoman Virginia Falck said the term ``reliable source''
referred primarily to members of Congress, the major source of
obscenity complaints. She said it might also include individuals as
well as such conservative NEA critics as the Rev. Pat Robertson and
the American Family Association.
   Since the obscenity ban was enacted last October, Ms. Falck
said, the endowment has fielded several dozen inquiries from
members of Congress about possible violations, but none has
resulted in withdrawal of grant awards.
   Ms. Davis said that if the panel determines there is a
``substantial basis'' for the allegations, the grant recipient will
be asked to respond. If the recipient persists in violating a
congressional ban on use of federal funds for obscene art, the NEA
says it will demand return of grant funds.
   Ms. Falck said the committee, patterned after a similar panel in
the Federal Communications Commission, would be established soon.
She stressed that its primary function would be to investigate
complaints and not to engage in an anti-obscenity witch hunt.
   ``This is not an attempt to roust out all obscenity,'' she said.
``It's not Big Brother coming in.''
   In a related development, NEA chairman John E. Frohnmayer served
notice that he will continue to require grant recipients to sign a
controversial anti-obscenity pledge until a New York federal judge
rules on a lawsuit charging that the pledge violates the
Constitution's free speech guarantees.
   Frohnmayer instituted the pledge last fall after Congress voted
to prohibit federal support for works that ``may be considered
obscene, including but not limited to depictions of sadomasochism,
homoeroticism, the sexual exploitation of children or individuals
engaged in sex acts and which, when taken as a whole, do not have
serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.''
   The obscenity ban was tacked onto the NEA's current $171 million
appropriation after Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and other
conservative lawmakers complained that some images in
endowment-supported exhibitions of works by photographer Robert
Mapplethorpe and artist Andres Serrano were pornographic and
sacrilegious.
   At a tumultuous meeting in early August, the National Council on
the Arts, the presidentially appointed advisory body to the
endowment, urged Frohnmayer to eliminate the pledge, which has
prompted widespread protests in the arts community.
   Frohnmayer wrote council members on Friday that he will delay a
decision on dropping the pledge until the federal court rules _
possibly within the next month _ on the suit filed against the NEA
by the New School for Social Research in New York.
   Frohnmayer said ``significant constitutional interpretation may
be involved'' in the New York ruling. A similar lawsuit has been
filed by the Bella Lewitzky dance company in Los Angeles.
   The American Poetry Review is the seventh artist or arts
organization to reject an NEA grant over the obscenity issue. The
magazine's editors said they acted after several months of
discussions with NEA officials about how obscenity allegations
would be handled.
   Co-editor David Bonanno said in a telephone interview from
Philadelphia that Ms. Davis' letter of July 23 was ``the final
straw.'' He said the plan for a watchdog panel ``seemed to be one
more unworkable aspect of all this,'' and prompted the Review's
decision on July 30 to reject its $10,000 endowment grant.

<HEAD>Study: Dilantin Ineffective For Head Injury After a Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dilantin, an epilepsy drug routinely prescribed
for up to three years after a head injury to prevent seizures,
works well for a week but is ineffective after that, a study today
concludes.
   The year-long study of Dilantin, known generically as phenytoin,
was prompted by doubts over its long-term effectiveness.
   The study of 404 patients found that 4 percent of those on
Dilantin suffered seizures in the first week after injury, compared
with 14 percent of those who got placebos. Thus, Dilantin reduced
the risk of seizures 73 percent.
   However, over the next two years there was no significant
difference in the two groups.
   The study, directed by Dr. Nancy R. Temkin at the University of
Washington in Seattle, was published in the New England Journal of
Medicine. It was financed in part by Warner-Lambert-Parke Davis,
which makes Dilantin.
   An estimated 500,000 Americans suffer head trauma that results
in brain injury each year. About 2 percent suffer recurring
seizures as a result.

   Charles V. Harrelson may owe his life to the
United States Supreme Court. Hired to kill U.S. District Judge John
H. Wood Jr. in 1979, Harrelson was convicted of murder but never
had to face the death penalty.
   Seven years before he shot Wood, the Supreme Court overturned
death penalty statutes throughout the United States because they
didn't safeguard defendants.
   While three dozen states have passed new laws enabling them to
resume executions, there still is no death penalty for most
civilian federal crimes.
   ``If the death penalty had been there, I would have sought it,''
said Assistant U.S. Attorney Ray Jahn, who prosecuted Harrelson in
San Antonio, Texas. ``Clearly he would have been entitled to death
penalty treatment had there been a federal death penalty.''
   This year, the full Senate and the House Judiciary Committee
have passed bills that would reinstate the death penalty for some
federal crimes, something President Bush sought last year.
   The Senate version covers 34 crimes _ including killing any
federal employee from the president to an egg inspector, or
committing murder to aid racketeering.
   The House committee's version is more limited. If that version
is approved by the full House, differences with the Senate bill
would be resolved in conference committee.
   Just two years ago, the death penalty was reinstated for very
specific drug-related murders, but no one has been executed.
   Even if the federal death penalty is reinstated more broadly,
it's not clear how often it would be used.
   The last federal execution was March 15, 1963, nine years before
the Supreme Court decision, when 28-year-old convicted kidnapper
Victor H. Feguer was hanged at Iowa State Penitentiary.
   From 1927 through 1963, there were 34 federal executions,
including six people electrocuted in 1942 for World War II-related
sabotage and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, electrocuted in 1953 for
espionage.
   Far more people are executed by states: Texas alone has executed
37 people since it resumed capital punishment in 1982. That's
because most people who are executed are convicted killers and most
murder cases are prosecuted under state laws.
   There are exceptions, of course. States cannot prosecute crimes
that occur on federal property _ an inmate who kills a guard at a
federal prison, for example.
   On Oct. 22, 1983, two inmates killed two guards in separate
incidents at the federal prison at Marion, Ill., which houses the
most violent federal inmates.
   Since the guards were killed on federal property, the state of
Illinois, which has a death penalty, had no jurisdiction, said
Bureau of Prisons spokesman Greg Bogdan. The inmates remain at
Marion.
   ``Marion is basically the end of the line,'' Bogdan said.
``There's nowhere else to go beyond there because there is no death
penalty for killing a guard. ... There is no deterrent at that
point to keep them from doing this again. A popular phrase we hear
is, `What are you going to do, lock me up?'''
   The pending Senate bill would reinstate the death penalty for
crimes that were on the books before the Supreme Court decision _
mail bombing; aircraft hijacking; bank robbery; treason; espionage;
presidential assassination; murder of a federal witness, federal
official or relative of a federal official to influence the
official; murder of a member of Congress, Cabinet or Supreme Court;
and murder of a series of Agriculture Department inspectors.
   Capital punishment could be imposed for treason and espionage
even when no death occurs and for attempted presidential
assassination if serious injury is inflicted, the bill says.
   The Senate bill also would increase the maximum penalty from
life imprisonment to death for six crimes when death occurs: murder
for hire, hostage taking, murder in aid of racketeering,
kidnapping, murder of a foreign official and genocide.
   Additionally, it would create five new death penalty offenses:
murder by a federal inmate serving a life sentence; drug kingpins
in a continuing criminal enterprise even if no murders occur; drug
kingpins who try to kill to obstruct justice; drug felons who
unintentionally kill with aggravated recklessness; and people who
kill with a firearm during a violent or drug-trafficking crime.
   The House committee version is more restrictive. For example, it
would not allow capital punishment for such offenses as mail
bombing, bank robbery, murder in aid of racketeering, murder by a
federal inmate serving a life term or murder of a federal
official's relative.
   The House panel also dropped from the list the killing of horse,
meat, poultry and egg products inspectors.
   Some of the estimated 10,000 federal agriculture inspectors do
face danger, said Tony Imhof, USDA's assistant general counsel for
legislation.
   Though he recalled no recent killings, he said inspectors
sometimes are assaulted. Meat production and packing operations are
``a very tough business,'' Imhof said. ``It's not conducted by
Ph.D.s.''

<HEAD>Gingrich Blames Democrats for Economic Woes, Wants Tax Cuts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Republicans should press for tax cuts to head
off a recession that Democrats are helping to cause, GOP budget
negotiator Rep. Newt Gingrich says.
   Parting with President Bush over the need for new taxes but
supporting the president's push for a cut in the capital gains
rate, Gingrich said Wednesday his tax cut package would cost $10
billion to $15 billion.
   ``It will be clearly, dramatically less expensive than a
recession,'' said Gingrich, R-Ga., the No. 2 House Republican.
   Gingrich's call for tax cuts contrasts with Bush's concession in
June that higher taxes would be needed to reduce the massive
federal deficit. Details emerged earlier this month of an
administration package that included more than $20 billion in new
taxes, among them higher levies on alcohol and a limit on the
deductions allowed for state and local income taxes.
   Gingrich said his proposal may include reducing the capital
gains tax rate, providing tax breaks for first-time home buyers,
and dramatically boosting the personal exemption allowed on income
tax.
   He also is considering proposing a cut in the Social Security
payroll tax, setting up new Individual Retirement Accounts and
providing more tax breaks for manufacturers, he said.
   Gingrich stressed that his differences lie with Democrats. He
singled out Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, a
stalwart opponent of cutting the capital gains tax rate.
   The country faces a recession ``which frankly I believe Senator
Mitchell has frankly been planning for and which I think his
behavior has clearly helped lead to,'' Gingrich said.
   A spokeswoman for Mitchell would not comment.
   Gingrich said he believed there is a ``real danger'' of a
recession, especially since the Persian Gulf crisis has boosted
petroleum prices and sent other ripples through the U.S. economy.
He said tax cuts are the only way to avert such an economic
downturn.
   ``I believe the number one goal of the Republican Party should
be to help the country avoid a recession, despite the Democratic
leadership of Congress,'' he said.
   He also criticized Democrats for not offering a
deficit-reduction plan at this year's budget talks between
congressional leaders and the administration.
   ``They're following a strategy of taking the risk that Americans
will be put out of work for the political advantage of the
Democratic Party,'' said Gingrich.
   The budget talks, which began in May, have produced no
breakthroughs and are in recess during Congress' August break.
Bargainers have been looking for $50 billion in new taxes and
spending cuts for fiscal 1991 _ which starts Oct. 1 _ and $500
billion over five years.
   Bargainers plan to resume their sessions next month with private
sessions at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, just outside the
capital. Participants say they believe the secluded location will
help them work out a deal more quickly.

   Three earthquakes hit Tokyo and the surrounding
area in a three-hour period today, interrupting rail service,
officials said. Police said there were no immediate reports of
damage or casualties.
   The first and largest of the quakes and had a preliminary
measurement of 5.2 on the Richter scale, the Central Meteorological
Agency said. An earthquake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable
damage.
   The meteorological agency said it was followed by a weaker
second quake and a third tremor with a preliminary 5.1 reading on
the Richter scale.
   The tremors all were centered in the central part of Chiba
Prefecture (state), 21 miles east of Tokyo.
   Because of the quakes, a total of 20 scheduled northbound
high-speed bullet train runs were canceled and another 20 runs were
delayed up to about two hours, affecting some 10,000 people,
railway officials said.
   Portions of three local railway lines in Chiba were temporarily
out of service for safety inspections. Inspectors found no
immediate visible damage, said a railway official on condition of
anonymity.
   An official of the agency's Seismic Division said the quakes had
little effect on land because the epicenters were relatively deep _
30 to 36 miles for the two largest ones.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded by
seismographs. Every increase of one means a tenfold increase in
magnitude. An earthquake of 5 on the Richter scale can cause
considerable damage.

<HEAD>Canada Ships Tainted Meat to US, Senator Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A member of the Senate Agriculture Committee
says Canadian companies are sending tainted meat to the United
States and should not be allowed to avoid inspection as the
administration proposed.
   Sen. Thomas Daschle, D-S.D., said Wednesday he has received
continued reports detailing Canadian abuses of the U.S. meat
inspection law.
   The Agriculture Department has proposed eliminating U.S.
inspection of Canadian meat and poultry imports and wants to
experiment with ending spot checks.
   But Daschle said U.S. Inspector William Lehman from Sweetgrass,
Mont., wrote him last week saying that 40,000 pounds of meat he had
inspected and rejected as ``sour and putrid'' on Aug. 10
reappeared, repackaged and partially frozen, at Pembina, N.D., on
Aug. 15.
   Lehman said in his letter to Daschle that the Canadian inspector
said she was not surprised ``as this was the second or third time
this load had been refused entry at the border.''
   U.S. law makes it a felony to return a product to the United
States that has been refused entry under any circumstances.
   ``How can we even think of opening the U.S.-Canada border with
no inspection of meat and poultry when Canadian companies are
admittedly sending bad meat from port to port hoping it will get by
some U.S. inspector. I just can't understand,'' said Daschle.
   He said many examples similar to that exposed by Inspector
Lehman have surfaced since he held a hearing in July on the
Agriculture Department proposal.
   At the request of Daschle and Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., USDA
has said it will extend the comment period on the proposal until
Sept. 5. The ``open border'' experiment could begin late this year
or early next year, if USDA decides to proceed.
   The General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm,
released a report critical of the proposal. The report recommended
that if inspection is stopped the department must find another way
to make sure consumers are protected.

   The United Nations-sponsored trade embargo
against Iraq could soon cause a critical food shortage for the
Persian Gulf nation, says the National Food Processors Association.
   Iraq, isolated because of its invasion of Kuwait, imports about
80 percent of its food, and stocks are running low, the association
says in its most recent newsletter.
   The food processors organization says Kuwait, which also is
subject to the embargo, has enough canned goods to feed its people
for several months. But since Kuwait imports about 96 percent of
its food, those supplies also will run out eventually.
   The food processors' newsletter quoted government statistics
showing that American food processors sent about $350 million worth
of processed foods and beverages to Iraq in 1989.
   They included:
   _$90 million in fats and oils (mainly soybean).
   _$16 million in butter and condensed and evaporated milk.
   _$9 million in great northern beans.
   _$5 million in cheddar cheese (in 1990).
   _$6 million in preparations for beverages.
   Iraq was the 10th largest customer for American food last year,
accounting for about $1 billion of the $37.2 billion in U.S.
agriculture exports. Wheat, rice and feed grains make up the
largest portion of the exports.

   Vegetable growers received an average 6
percent less at market during the first seven months of 1990
compared with last year at this time, the Agriculture Department
says.
   The report, released Wednesday, said the downturn occurred
despite a weather-induced 19 percent price increase in the first
quarter.
   ``The winter's freeze-reduced output gave way to
larger-than-normal spring vegetable supplies, particularly Florida
tomatoes,'' said the report.
   First quarter retail prices for tomatoes, peppers and cabbage
were especially high compared with a year earlier, but fell back
during the second quarter, USDA said.
   Processors contracted for more of the five principal processing
vegetables this year because of strong demand and low beginning
stocks.
   Tonnage of processing tomatoes, for example was projected at a
record 11.1 million tons this year.
   ``Given the increased processing tomato tonnage, an 8 percent
rise in green pea output, and the 3-year average yields for the
other crops, total tonnage for the five major processing vegetables
will likely range between 15 million and 16 million, up from 14.5
million in 1989,'' said the report.

   Americans with assets of at least $500,000
make up only 1.6 percent of the population but own nearly 28.5
percent of the nation's personal wealth, the Internal Revenue
Service says.
   The 3.3 million richest Americans had holdings in 1986 of $4.3
trillion, the IRS reported. Subtracting their $500 billion of debts
left a net worth of $3.8 trillion _ almost enough to finance the
entire federal budget for four years.
   In the same study, based on 1986 data, the IRS suggested the
United States now has well over 1 million millionaires. In 1976,
there were 180,000 people with a net worth of $1 million or more;
that grew to 475,000 in 1982 and 941,000 in 1986.
   The new report, drawing on information from estate-tax returns,
supports findings in other recent studies that rich people are
increasing their numbers and their wealth. The IRS study offers no
reason for the changes, but other researchers credit seven years of
growth in the economy and a major overhaul of tax laws.
   A similar IRS study found that in 1982, 2.2 million Americans
with assets of at least $500,000 held 23 percent of the personal
wealth. Their net worth totaled $2.1 trillion.
   The new study found that women held 43 percent of total assets
owned by the 3.3 million wealthiest but only 29 percent of the
debts. Thus, their average net worth of $1.17 million was better
than the $1.11 million of the rich men.
   Women were slightly more likely than men to favor real estate
investments over corporate stock, but among the wealthy in general,
the No. 1 investment choice was real estate. That was a departure
from the past, the IRS said.
   ``Considering the relative performance of the real estate and
stock markets between 1982 and 1986, this reversal was not
unexpected,'' wrote IRS analysts Marvin Schwartz and Barry Johnson.
They noted blue-chip stock values rose more than 103 percent from
1982 to 1986 while the average value of new one-family homes went
up only 14 percent.
   More than one-quarter of the richest adults were in California
(558,000) and New York (340,000). Texas, battered by declining oil
prices, dropped from second to third place with 250,000; Florida
had 238,000; Illinois, 148,500.
   Per capita, the IRS said, Connecticut had the largest
concentration of wealthy people, at 327 per 10,000 adults.
California had 299 per 10,000. The national average was 198 per
10,000.
   For statistical reasons, the IRS did not count the 25,100 people
with net worths of $10 million or more when estimating the wealthy
in each state, although they are included among the 3.3 million.
They were worth nearly $538 billion, an average of $21.4 million
each.
   Average net worth of the rich ranged from $473,510 in North
Dakota to $1.25 million in Oregon.
   Other findings, reported in the latest IRS ``Statistics of
Income Bulletin,'' include:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Over 1.17 million of the very wealthy were under age 50 and had
almost $1.1 trillion net worth. About the same number were between
50 and 64 but owed less and thus had a greater worth _ $1.38
trillion. Those 65 and over among the very rich number 959,000 and
were worth $1.3 trillion.
   _Debt declines with age. The under-50 wealthy owed an average
$266,000; the 50-64 group, $195,000; those 65 and older owed an
average $72,000.
   _2.4 million of the wealthiest had equity of almost $60 billion
in life insurance policies.
   _Almost all the 3.3 million super-rich had cash; it totaled $402
billion, an average of $123,740 per person.
   _2.7 million owned corporate stock with total value of $1.3
trillion, an average of $482,650 each.
   _More than 3 million owned real estate, with a total value of
$1.24 trillion, or an average $408,300 apiece.
   _About half the number _ 1.7 million _ held bonds worth $388
billion. U.S. Savings Bonds valued at $8.5 billion were held by
360,000, an average of $23,660.

   U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering on
Wednesday reported progress by the five permanent Security Council
members in drafting a resolution allowing military force to back up
U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III called Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze to urge Moscow to cooperate more fully
in isolating Iraq, a State Department official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The official said Baker sought Soviet endorsement for a Security
Council resolution sanctioning at least minimal use of military
force to stop Iraqi shipping.
   Shevardnadze asked Washington to go slow on seeking U.N.
blessing for any military action, but did not threaten to veto any
Security Council resolution to enforce a blockade, the official
said.
   Soviet U.N. Ambassador Valentin Lozinsky said, ``The main
obstacle is that force should be used very carefully, and at due
time.''
   Another U.S. official said privately in New York the talks
between Baker and Shevardnadze were another reason for hope the
Kremlin will side with Washington.
   No formal council meeting has been called to discuss a
resolution authorizing the use of military force.
   But an informal private session was called late Wednesday at the
request of Jordan and Bulgaria who wanted to discuss the hardships
they were suffering by honoring the trade embargo against Iraq.
   Both countries said they have the right under the U.N. charter
``to consult the Security Council with regard to a solution of
those problems.''
   The meeting ended just before midnight and decided to compensate
Jordan, however, diplomats said no particular figures were
discussed.
   Jordan has temporarily closed its border with Iraq because it
has been inundated with tens of thousands of foreigners since the
Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Iraq is a major trading partner
and supplies most of Jordan's oil. The Jordanian port of Aqaba has
been hard-hit by the cutoff in trade with Iraq.
   Jordan has been allowing some food shipments into Iraq on
``humanitarian'' grounds, which is allowed under the sanctions
resolution approved Aug. 6.
   ``We are applying for relief because Jordan, in applying
sanctions, will face enormous economic problems,'' said Jordanian
Ambassador Samir Naouri. ``They are so huge and difficult that we
will require assistance in overcoming them.''
   He said it was up to the council to decide whether Jordan should
be compensated for its losses or exempted from the embargo.
   Bulgarian representatives at the United Nations have said their
country is also feeling the pinch from the sanctions.
   Bulgaria is a major transshipment point between the Persian Gulf
and Eastern Europe, they said. While Bulgaria's total foreign debt
is $10.4 billion, Iraq owes $1.2 billion to Bulgaria and has been
supplying oil as payment.
   At a news conference in Kennebunkport, Maine, President Bush
praised the Soviets for their ``superb cooperation'' with
Washington in dealing with the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Bush described differences between U.S. and Soviet positions on
the proposed U.N. resolution as mere differences in timing.
   In Baghdad, senior U.N. officials Virendra Dayal and Kofi Annan
held long talks with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz on the fate
of the 2 million foreigners caught in Kuwait and Iraq by the
invasion.
   In four resolutions, the Security Council has denounced the
invasion, declared an international economic boycott of Iraq,
rejected Iraq's proclaimed annexation of Kuwait, and demanded all
foreigners be allowed to go home.
   But it has not yet approved a blockade of Iraqi shipping or
sanctioned use of force by the U.S.-led multinational force in the
gulf to stop ships.
   The Soviets the past week have wanted to revive the Military
Staff Committee before imposing a blockade. The committee consists
of military officers of the five permanent council members to
coordinate U.N. enforcement actions, but it has never had an active
role, even in the 1950-53 Korean War.
   The United States, Britain and France were supportive of a
unique resolution that would provide a U.N. umbrella, but not a
U.N. flag and command, for international warships enforcing the
embargo.
   Western diplomats say Moscow has been unwilling to increase U.N.
involvement unless ``clear and demonstrable failure'' of the
embargo is shown.
   China had dragged its feet for the same reason, but a Kuwaiti
official in Beijing said Wednesday that China promised not to block
such a move.
   The permanent Security Council members weighed a
precedent-setting proposal that would authorize foreign naval
vessels to use minimum force in policing the U.N. embargo, but
reached no agreement.
   The ambassadors of the United States, Britain and France met
privately Wednesday with the Soviet and Chinese envoys trying to
work out language for a Security Council endorsement of a blockade
on which all could agree.
   On his way into the meeting at the French Mission, Pickering was
asked if the Soviets were blocking progress. Pickering replied,
``Well, I don't put my finger on anybody, we'll wait and see.''
   The ambassadors broke off at midday, then resumed later.
   ``We're making progress,'' Pickering said.``We're going to
continue our consultations.''
   Under Article 42 of the U.N. Charter, the Security Council may
call for a blockade and enforcement of its embargo through military
force if sanctions have been violated. This article has never been
invoked.
   Iraq's President Saddam Hussein has said he will use the
thousands of U.S. and British citizens in Kuwait and Iraq as human
shields at Iraqi military sites and industries to ward off U.S.
attack.

   Connie Sellecca claims she was fired from the
starring role in ABC's upcoming comedy ``Baby Talk'' and is suing
for more than $1.5 million.
   The lawsuit, filed Tuesday, alleges that producer Ed Weinberger
``beat up on Sellecca emotionally'' and demanded that she submit
unconditionally to his authority.
   Sellecca, a former star of ABC's ``Hotel,'' claimed she was paid
only $25,000 for the pilot episode instead of a promised $45,000.
   Weinberger and Columbia Pictures Television declined to comment
Wednesday.
   ``Baby Talk,'' a spinoff of the hit film ``Look Who's Talking,''
has been beset by problems. Before the spat with Sellecca, ABC had
ordered the pilot redone.

   Spike Lee defended his film ``Mo' Better Blues''
against charges of anti-Semitism and advised his critics to examine
Hollywood history if they want to see real stereotyping.
   The director, who is black, has come under attack from Jewish
organizations for the movie characters Moe and Josh Flatbush.
   ``I challenge anyone to tell me why I can't portray two club
owners who happen to be Jewish and who exploit the black musicians
who work for them,'' Lee wrote Wednesday on The New York Times
opinion page. ``All Jewish club owners are not like this, that's
true, but these two are.''
   Lee accused his critics of applying a double standard.
   ``Not every black person is a pimp, murderer, prostitute,
convict, rapist or drug addict, but that hasn't stopped Hollywood
from writing these roles for African-Americans,'' Lee wrote.

   Wagoner, known for sequined stage outfits, was Dolly Parton's

   ``He was hurt by it,'' Kathie Lee Gifford, a TV talk show host,
told Parade magazine in its Aug. 26 issue. ``He couldn't understand
why Howard didn't just become an elder statesman of sportscasting.''
   Cosell, in his book ``I Never Played the Game,'' criticized his
partners in the ABC broadcast booth, Gifford and Don Meredith.
   Cosell said Gifford was a ``Teflon man'' because no matter what
mistakes he made, ``nothing sticks to him'' and TV critics treat
him well. He also said Meredith was rarely prepared for a broadcast.

schools and colleges this year, yet Education Secretary Lauro
Cavazos says ``money alone will not buy us superior schools.''
   Cavazos released the Department of Education's annual
``back-to-school'' statistical forecast for the 1990-91 school year
and noted the spending projection is a 6.9 percent jump from last
year's estimate of $359 billion. The total includes local, state
and federal spending, as well as dollars from private sources.
   The total consists of current expenditures by local state and
federal government, interest and capital outlays.
   This year, as in recent years, spending by educational
institutions at all levels will amount to about 6.9 percent of the
gross national product, the report said.
   ``We can take pride in our continuing investment in education,
but money alone will not buy us superior schools or the wisdom and
security that education can provide,'' said Cavazos, holding firm
to the administration's position that education funding should not
be increased.
   ``We must keep our attention focused on results,'' he added,
pointing to the national education goals adopted earlier this year
by President Bush and the nation's governors.
   The report said elementary and secondary schools will have the
largest spending increase, 7.2 percent over last year from $216
billion to $231 billion. Adjusting for inflation, this is a 34
percent increase since 1980-81.
   About 46.2 million young people will attend elementary and
secondary schools, more than 200,000 over last year's total, the
report projected.
   Spending for each student in kindergarten through 12th grade is
expected to reach a record $5,638 in 1990-91, $354 more per student
than last year. After adjusting for inflation, per-pupil spending
has risen about 33 percent over the last decade.
   The average salary of public elementary and secondary school
teachers is expected to rise to $33,300, up 6 percent over last
year's average of $31,304.
   Spending at public and private colleges and universities will
total an estimated $152.5 billion, 6.5 percent above last year. For
each full-time student, the spending is projected at $15,596, or
$833 more per student than a year ago.
   The report said 13.6 million students are expected to enroll in
public and private colleges and universities, an increase of more
than 100,000 from fall 1989.
   Other highlights of the report were:
   _Between 1980 and 1990, the states with the largest enrollment
increases _ as a percentage of total enrollment _ have been Alaska,
Utah, Nevada, Florida, Arizona, California and Texas. Since 1985,
New Mexico and New Hampshire also have had large enrollment
increases.
   _The high school graduating class of 1991 is expected to total
about 2.5 million, nearly 200,000 fewer students than in 1990,
reflecting a decline in the 17- and 18-year-old population.
   _This fall about 7.3 million people will be employed in the
nation's schools and colleges _ about 100,000 more than a year ago.
Nearly 2.8 million will be classroom teachers at the elementary and
secondary levels, an increase of about 50,000; 760,000 will teach
in colleges and universities; and 3.8 million will be employed in
other professional, administrative, and support positions.

   The horrific fighting between
rival black factions is part of a growing power struggle that
threatens South Africa's stability and hopes of building a
multiracial democracy.
   The fighting that has raged in black townships around
Johannesburg since Aug. 12 pits Zulu supporters of the conservative
Inkatha movement against Xhosas, most of them supporters of the
African National Congress.
   More than 500 blacks have been killed in savage battles with
guns, spears, knives and axes.
   While the struggle between Inkatha and the ANC centers around
ideological and leadership disputes, the fighting is increasingly
turning into a war between the country's two largest black tribes.
Some fear the fighting is the start of a war for control of the
country.
   ``Has the descent into a Beirut-style apocalypse begun?'' asked
the Sunday Times, the country's largest newspaper, in an Aug. 19
editorial.
   At a time when President F.W. de Klerk is moving to end
white-minority rule, many leaders fear black-on-black violence is
spinning out of control.
   ``A culture of violence'' is becoming part of South African
life, they say, undermining efforts to establish a peaceful,
democratic society.
   Many political leaders fear the recent fighting around
Johannesburg will be worse than the conflict between ANC and
Inkatha supporters in the eastern province of Natal, which has
claimed about 5,000 lives in the past five years.
   White and black leaders are increasingly concerned that black
violence could derail negotiations to end white rule. Many whites
are reluctant to accept a black government, saying it will usher in
more violence.
   ``The high incidence of unrest points to a revolutionary
climate, and that is dangerous at a time when restraint is
necessary in order to negotiate,'' said one official, who declined
to be named.
   The divisions between the ANC and Inkatha are varied and
complex. Tribal and leadership differences and a struggle for power
are at the heart of the rivalry.
   Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi is determined to play a
national role in South Africa if white-minority rule ends. Many ANC
leaders appear equally determined to exclude Buthelezi from any
future black majority government.
   ANC leader Nelson Mandela has rebuffed Buthelezi's calls for a
meeting to help end the violence. ANC leaders have rejected peace
talks, saying Inkatha is responsible for the violence.
   Inkatha's power base is in rural areas where tradition is
strong. Zulus, 7 million strong, were the dominant tribe before
white conquest in the last century and many still recall their
nation's power.
   The ANC draws much of its support from young, city dwellers
throughout the country, though many of its top leaders are Xhosas.
There are about 6 million Xhosas in the country.
   Inkatha and the ANC both oppose apartheid and were allies
briefly in the 1970s, but have become increasingly hostile toward
one another during the past decade.
   The two groups differ in their visions of a post-apartheid South
Africa. The ANC leans towards socialist remedies to solve black
poverty and wants to end tribal differences. Inkatha favors a free
market economy, traditional society and is largely based on Zulu
nationalism.
   Buthelezi participates in the homeland system created by the
white-minority government, saying blacks must run their own affairs
as an interim step on the road to black majority rule. The ANC says
Buthelezi has sold out to the apartheid system because he heads the
KwaZulu homeland in Natal.
   Fighting between the ANC and Inkatha in the black townships also
ignites random violence between other groups, drawing in criminal
gangs, looters and terrified people simply trying to stay alive.
   In the squalid black townships ringing South African cities,
violence has become a daily part of life for blacks competing
desperately for survival. Caught by hopelessness and poverty,
violence is one of the few ways for blacks to vent their anger.
   The causes of black violence are numerous and complex. Reasons
cited include apartheid, poverty, school boycotts and lack of
education, political and ideological rivalries, the collapse of
authority in black townships, gangs and corruption.

   Skeptics about the wisdom of President Bush's
decision to risk war in the Persian Gulf are beginning to speak out
_ and some of the sharpest criticism comes from conservatives who
usually are in Bush's corner.
   The critics argue that the potential risk is not worth the
potential gain, that the fight is over no higher principle than
cheap oil, that Bush is talking multinational response but acting
unilaterally, that the United States cannot afford this
confrontation.
   They argue that Bush's comparison of Iraq's Saddam Hussein with
Nazi Germany's Adolf Hitler is overdrawn and closes the door on
compromise. They says that Hitler threatened civilization itself,
while Saddam threatens only to raise the price of gasoline _ and
has replaced one autocratic regime in Kuwait, run by billionaire
oil emirs, with another autocratic regime, run by himself.
   Thus, while public opinion seems solidly behind the president,
Bush is being challenged by some who think the deployment can only
lead to long-lasting trouble.
   Military strategist Edward N. Luttwak, a Pentagon adviser and
senior fellow at the conservative Center for Strategic and
International Studies, for example, cites both moral and strategic
reasons in questioning Bush's decision to defend Saudi Arabia from
a possible Iraqi attack.
   Saudi Arabia, Luttwak said, ``is a regime whose members are
still gambling on the French Riviera, as Radio Baghdad says. ...
Once people in the United States find out what we're defending,
they will revolt against it.''
   But Iraq cannot be blockaded into submission, Luttwak said. Some
food will get through, and anyway, the Iraqi government ``can
increase the availability of food just by not supplying the Kurdish
areas.''
   Even such a stalwart hardliner as Jeanne Kirkpatrick, former
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, seems reserved in her
support.
   ``The burden we've assumed, the responsibility we've assumed,''
she told interviewers last week, ``is larger than our national
interest.''
   The president was lucky in one respect _ the crisis arose just
as Congress was leaving on a month's vacation. Lawmakers who might
harbor misgivings are apparently content to let home sentiment take
shape before they speak out.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, a reliable Bush ally, suggests
the broad support for the president's massive commitment of force
will soften if the troops stay for a long time.
   ``What will it be in 30 days or 60 days or 90 days?'' Dole asked
last week during a visit to Portland, Ore.
   A Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll conducted last weekend found
72-16 percent approval for Bush's handling of the crisis. But
respondents split almost evenly _ 43-42 percent _ on whether the
United States should take military action if Iraq refuses to
withdraw from Kuwait. One of Bush's stated goals is to force
Saddam's withdrawal.
   The Rev. William Sloane Coffin Jr., the former Yale University
chaplain who became nationally known for his leadership of the
anti-Vietnam war movement, thinks Bush moved too fast and too alone.
   ``I don't see why we have to have an enormous buildup,'' he
said. ``It is just asking for trouble. It is provocational.
   ``An invasion of Kuwait or Iraq itself would be moral folly,''
Coffin added. ``When one side has chemical weapons and the other
nuclear weapons as well, fighting fire with fire could leave only
ashes.''
   Bush's goal is too fuzzy to command the sacrifice of the
American people, says one critic with a chestful of battle ribbons
_ retired Rear Adm. Gene La Rocque.
   A veteran of World War II and Vietnam who has been active in the
peace movement for 18 years, La Rocque said his own son in the Navy
anticipates being sent to the Gulf region any day now.
   ``There is no clarity of purpose in our action,'' said La
Rocque, head of the Center for Defense Information. ``We don't know
if it's for the oil or we're trying to preserve world order or just
trying to punish Saddam Hussein. It's just as unclear in our
purpose as we were in Vietnam.''
   La Rocque joins those who fault Bush's comparison of Saddam to
Hitler. ``This is about oil,'' he said.
   ``By using the Hitler analogy,'' wrote newspaper columnist
Patrick J. Buchanan, who served in the Reagan White House, ``Mr.
Bush is virtually ruling out any negotiated settlement.''
   Conservative Tom Bethell, Washington editor of the American
Spectator, questions what principle is at stake.
   ``It is hard to understand why Americans are supposed to become
outraged _ and pay more at the pump _ because Kuwait's oil is now
controlled by a tyrant in a military uniform rather than by
oligarchs in traditional attire,'' Bethell wrote in the Los Angeles
Times.
   Luttwak added that American public opinion is not ``cynical and
materialistic'' enough to support a military operation driven by a
desire for cheap, abundant petroleum.
   Bush comes under criticism, too, on more pragmatic grounds _
that he has created a policy dilemma.
   Leon Hadar, an Israel-born American citizen and professor of
international relations at American University, worries about the
fallout.
   ``I think a military confrontation between the U.S. and Iraq
will lead to tremendous chaos, to the fall of King Hussein in
Jordan, to possible involvement of Syria and Israel in a war over
Jordan,'' Hadar said. ``I see major anti-American radicalization in
the Arab world that will lead to the fall of moderate regimes in
Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt _ and even Saudi Arabia.
   ``Are the American people really willing to have a permanent
force of 50,000 to 100,000 troops in the Persian Gulf to keep these
monarchies in power?'' he asked.
   ``Take the best case scenario: Saddam Hussein is overthrown,''
Hadar said. ``Who are you going to replace him with? The idea that
the United States is going to find some Thomas Jefferson in Iraq is
nonsense. And for an Iraqi Jefferson to stay in power, you'd need a
permanent American force to back him up.''

   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, whose call for
help against Iraq triggered the biggest U.S. military operation
since Vietnam, has weathered many a political storm during his
eight years in power.
   In asking the Americans to deploy troops in his kingdom, Fahd
has been widely seen as taking his biggest calculated risk _ but
with the odds largely in his favor.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, trying to deflect Arab
condemnation of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, criticized what
he called corrupt Arab leaders for opening the door to a U.S.
presence in Saudi Arabia, the site of Islam's holiest shrines.
   He urged the Arab world to overthrow the Saudi and other
moderate Arab royal families and to take back the holy cities of
Mecca and Medina.
   But Fahd's resistance to Saddam quickly gained the blessing not
only of most neighboring Arab governments but also of the
influential ulema, the learned Moslems of Saudi Arabia who have
helped keep the Al-Saud dynasty in power.
   The 67-year-old monarch with the spade-like beard is publicly
committed to Arab causes and a scrupulous promoter of the Islamic
faith.
   In 1986, he dropped ``His Majesty,'' insisting that his title be
``Custodian Of The Two Holy Shrines,'' the Kaaba in Mecca and the
tomb of Mohammed, the prophet of Islam, in Medina.
   ``Our king is amiable, extremely generous, but can be as angry
as a volcano in dealing with crimes against religion or attempts to
undermine the security of the kingdom,'' the king's half-brother,
Prince Sattam, told The Associated Press in a recent interview.
   Fahd, the head of the clan that includes 4,000 princes, has
disclosed little about his personal life. He is often listed as the
second-richest man in the world, with $18 billion, after the Sultan
of Brunei.
   Aides portray Fahd as a workaholic and builder who combines the
traits of bedouin chivalry, munificence and global political vision.
   But while friends portray Fahd as a desert ascetic, critics
speak more of a man who enjoys the good life. They point out he
owns a 3,600-ton yacht called The Atlantis, a private 747 jet, and
palatial mansions in Riyadh, Jiddah, Taif, Dammam, London,
Marbella, Geneva, outside Paris and in the Riviera.
   In his bid to talk his OPEC partners out of seeking higher oil
prices, Fahd said that ``oil prices are tied to the prices of food
and manufactured products imported by the oil-exporting countries.''
   The kingdom at the onset of Fahd's rule was exporting 9.3
million barrels of oil a day, which dropped in August 1985 to a
mere 1.4 million. Fahd accepted the burden of absorbing the drop in
revenues while other oil exporting countries were trying to outbid
each other by exceeding their production quotas and offering price
discounts.
   Fahd has harnessed oil resources to promote prosperity and build
modern highways, cities and armed forces.
   Fahd ascended to the throne shortly after the outbreak of the
Islamic revolution, the advent of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in
Iran. The Iranians tried to turn Mecca into a hotbed of political
action and terrorism during the annual hajj pilgrimage seasons.
   Fahd decided to break relations with Tehran in 1988.
   Arab diplomatic sources said Arab oil countries, mainly Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait, together poured an estimated $34 billion into
Iraq's coffers to defray Baghdad's war costs with Iran. No one
knows in precise terms the breakdown, but indications were the
Kuwaitis paid about $11 billion and Saudi Arabia about $18 billion.
   The Saudis on several occasions offered to help Iraq and Iran
with billions of dollars for reconstruction and development if they
halted their protracted war, which ended with a cease-fire in 1988.
But the offer went unheeded by both sides.
   Fahd is credited for his efforts to try to end 15-year-old
Lebanese civil war and for a 1982 plan for a comprehensive
Arab-Israeli peace.
   The plan envisaged a comprehensive peace treaty between Israel
and the Arabs based mainly on Israel's withdrawal from all Arab
territory seized during the 1967 Middle East war, in return for
secure and recognized borders for all countries of the region.
   It also called for an independent Palestinian state in the West
Bank of Jordan and the Gaza Strip with the Arab sector of Jerusalem
as its capital.
   Israel rejected the plan.

   Federal health officials want to know why
black Americans must wait nearly twice as long as whites for a
kidney transplant.
   ``It is clear that this is a problem that needs to be
confronted,'' Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan
said Wednesday in calling for an investigation following release of
an inspector general's report.
   The median waiting time for whites is 7.6 months, compared with
13.9 months for blacks, a disparity not accounted for by age, blood
type or immunological factors, the report said.
   ``We in government need to do what we can to assure that the
organ transplantation system works well for minority and
non-minority Americans alike,'' said Sullivan, who is black.
   The longer wait for blacks is particularly important because
they have higher rates of kidney failure, the report said. While
blacks account for 12 percent of the population, they make up 34
percent of dialysis patients.
   Blacks also are less likely than other groups to donate organs _
only 8 percent of kidneys transplanted in 1988 were from blacks,
the report noted. It suggested one reason for this may be that only
14 of an estimated 300 Organ Procurement Organization coordinators
across the country are black.
   Investigators from the Health and Human Services inspector
general's office analyzed the cases of 17,556 people who were
waiting for or received a first kidney transplant between Oct. 1,
1987, and March 31, 1989.
   They also visited organ procurement organizations in California,
Florida, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, interviewed transplant experts
and reviewed other reports and documents on the subject.
   Though they found no explanation for the racial disparity in
kidney transplants, investigators said other medical factors,
economic status and availability of social supports, none of which
were assessed in the study, might account for some of the gap.
   The report also suggested that racial prejudice might be a
factor.
   ``As the number of individuals awaiting a transplant increases,
this disparity becomes an increasingly serious matter warranting
national attention,'' the report said.
   The inquiry focused on kidney transplants because they account
for 75 percent of organ transplants. But, the report said, ``we
believe that most of the basic issues addressed in the report are
of equal significance to the distribution for transplantation of
hearts, livers and other organs.''
   The United Network for Organ Sharing, which runs the Organ
Procurement and Transplantation Network, established by Congress in
1984, is also investigating the disparity.
   ``We realize that there's a problem. We would like to understand
why there's a problem,'' said Wanda Bond, a spokeswoman for UNOS.
   The report recommended the system for allocating donor organs be
made more equitable with more coordination and cooperation among
the 250 transplant centers and 72 Organ Procurement Organizations
across the country.
   The current system is heavily controlled by the individual
transplant centers, which are allowed to retain nearly all the
organs they retrieve.
   As of April, 21,308 people in the United States were on waiting
lists for organ transplants.

<TEXT>
   The Venus-orbiting Magellan spacecraft,
back in radio contact with Earth after twice cutting off
communication, sent flight data home today to help engineers figure
out what went wrong.
   ``It's sitting there doing nothing but talking to us,'' said
Steve Wall, a Magellan scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory. ``We're looking for a root cause of the failures.''
   NASA engineers restored steady radio contact with Magellan on
Wednesday afternoon after a hair-raising 21{-hour struggle to
prevent the craft from becoming lost in space some 149 million
miles from Earth.
   ``This is a nervous Nellie, I'll tell you,'' lab spokesman Alan
Wood said.
   The successful conclusion of Magellan's latest crisis averted,
at least temporarily, another big setback for NASA. The agency
temporarily grounded its shuttle fleet this summer because of fuel
leaks, and also discovered the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope
had a flawed mirror that produced blurry images.
   Wall said he suspected there might be separate causes for
Magellan's latest radio cutoff, which started Tuesday night, and
for the first communications breakdown, which lasted 22 hours
beginning Aug. 16.
   But he said, ``We do not believe anything like a massive failure
occurred.''
   Wall said that evidence suggests a cosmic ray or high-energy
particle from the sun disrupted Magellan's electronics to cause
last week's problem, while the latest failure raises suspicion of
flaws in the ship's hardware or computer programs.
   Ed Sherry, a Magellan official, said programs in the backup
computer appeared to be ``corrupted'' and engineers will rewrite
them to try to solve at least part of the problem.
   Magellan's emergency systems also appeared to have
malfunctioned, complicating NASA's efforts to make Magellan call
home, so engineers sent computer commands to the spacecraft to
disable some of the systems.
   Just as they did last weekend, engineers also ordered Magellan
to unload its computer memory banks Wednesday night. The process
continued today.
   ``The patient is resting comfortably and is strong and healthy,
but needs an operation _ and we don't know which operation right
now,'' said Tommy Thompson, Magellan science manager.
   Wall said the start of Magellan's $744 million mission to make
the most detailed pictures and maps yet of Venus' misshapen
landscape will probably be postponed until the problem is solved.
Scientists had hoped to use Magellan's radar to peer through the
planet's thick clouds during the first week in September.
   The spacecraft was launched from the shuttle Atlantis 15 months
ago, then looped around the sun 1{ times, traveling 948 million
miles before it slid into orbit around Venus on Aug. 10.
   Long considered Earth's twin gone bad, Venus is similar to Earth
in size, mass and distance from the sun, but it was turned into a
hellish inferno with 900-degree surface temperatures because of an
out-of-control ``greenhouse effect.''
   Scientists want to know if the same geological forces that
shaped Earth also sculpted Venus.
   Magellan's first test pictures of Venus were released hours
before Tuesday's trouble. They show a landscape broken by quake
faults, giant solidified lava flows, volcanic cinder cones,
collapsed craters and long ridges and valleys.

<HEAD>Coffee Makers Recalled Because of Potential Fire Hazard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An estimated 800,000 Proctor-Silex automatic
drip coffee makers are being recalled because they pose a potential
fire hazard, the company and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety
Commission say.
   Proctor-Silex said it had received 181 reports of fire involving
the coffee maker, which was manufactured in 1985 and 1986 and sold
nationwide in thousands of commercial outlets, including Sears and
J.C. Penney.
   Owners should unplug the coffee makers and stop using them, the
company and safety agency said in a news release. The coffee makers
are not repairable, the release said.
   The company, which will issue a new coffee maker for each
recalled appliance, said thermostats and fuses may fail, causing
the coffee maker to overheat and possibly cause a fire.
   Some of the fires reported to the company caused property
damage. One owner received a minor burn when picking up an
overheated unit, the release said.
   The recall includes Proctor-Silex coffee makers with model
numbers that begin with A4 or A5 and series numbers that end with
the numbers 58 or 68.
   Recalled Sears Counter Craft and Sears Kenmore coffee makers are
models 360.480293 and 360.480272.

<HEAD>FBI Names Black Field Agent To Investigate Discrimination Claims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two weeks after the FBI settled a racial
harassment case brought by black agent Donald Rochon, the agency is
naming its top-ranking black field agent to investigate allegations
brought by Rochon, the FBI says.
   As part of the settlement of the Rochon case, the agency agreed
to conduct a full investigation of Rochon's claims and make the
findings public by next April, said Rochon's attorney, David Kairys
of Philadelphia.
   ``We are confirming that Paul Phillip will be heading an
investigation looking into the allegations made by Mr. Rochon,''
FBI spokesman Carlos Fernandez said Wednesday.
   Phillip, 43, currently heads the field office in San Juan,
Puerto Rico. He is the only black agent in charge of a bureau field
office.
   The appointment by FBI Director William S. Sessions was made
``very, very recently,'' Fernandez said, but it had not been
announced because, ``We have investigations all the time being
headed by special agents. We don't make announcements about that.''
   The New York Times reported Wednesday on the appointment.
   Rochon had charged in civil lawsuits that he was racially
harassed by white agents when he worked in the FBI's Chicago
office. Among other things, he claimed his family received
threatening telephone calls and letters, including one that
contained a photograph of the dismembered body of a black man.
Another contained a bull's eye superimposed with a picture of a
black man.
   Attorneys for the 40-year-old Rochon and the FBI signed an
agreement the week of Aug. 5 that settled the 3-year-old legal
battle. The settlement brought Rochon full pay and pension
benefits, possibly worth a total of more than $1 million, Kairys
said.

<HEAD>Bush Administration Proposes Aid for Haitian Army</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration wants to supply $1.2
million worth of training and equipment for the Haitian Army to
provide security at the Nov. 4 election, the State Department says.
   ``We believe the Haitian Army, which has supported the electoral
process and the provisional government of Mrs. (President Ertha
Pascal) Trouillot, must guarantee security on election day,''
department press officer David Denny said Wednesday.
   He said Congress has been notified of the administration's
proposal for a $1.2 million package of non-lethal aid, but no
further action has yet been taken.
   The U.S. aim is ``to foster free and fair elections in Haiti and
the establishment of a democratically elected government that has
the support of its people,'' Denny said. ``Our desire is to prevent
violence at the thousands of polling places where Haitians will
cast their votes,'' he added.
   The proposal is considered controversial because the Haitian
army was blamed for bloodshed at the November, 1987, election that
prompted the United States to halt aid to the Caribbean island
nation.
   A department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the proposed $1.2 million package would come from funds not
requiring appropriation by Congress, but serious opposition from
lawmakers might prompt abandonment of the proposal.

<HEAD>California Moves Toward an Earlier Primary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG WILLIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation to give California a major
role in the 1992 presidential race by moving up its primary to the
week after New Hampshire's has won a key vote in the Legislature.
   A conference committee Wednesday decided 5-0 to send the
proposal to the floor of the Senate and Assembly for a vote before
the Legislature adjourns Aug. 31.
   The proposal would move the presidential primary, now on the
Tuesday after the first Monday of June, up to the first Tuesday in
March. Supporters say that could transform it from an afterthought
into the nation's dominant early primary.
   ``We're trying to become a stronger player in national
politics,'' said Sen. Ken Maddy, Republican minority leader.
   Maddy declined to speculate on whether the measure would pass,
and Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, a Democrat, said no such
legislation would be approved without first getting support from
all party leaders of both houses.
   The proposal would leave all non-presidential primaries in June.
But many Republicans want to move those primaries to September.
   Because its June primary follows those of other states,
California hasn't had a role in choosing either party's
presidential nominee since 1964 in the Republican race and 1972 in
the Democratic race.
   That is the case even though the state has the nation's largest
primary and picks more than 20 percent of the delegates needed for
either party's nomination.In 1988, the California primary had 368
delegates at stake for Democrats and 175 for Republicans.
   Supporters of the bill say that because of the state's late
primary, presidential hopefuls ignore California except for brief
visits to raise money for their races in New Hampshire, Iowa and
other early primary and caucus states. New Hampshire has the first
primary of the season.
   Opponents argued that it would stack the political odds even
more against lesser-known candidates. They said California is so
big that the only way to compaign successfully is through expensive
TV advertising, meaning candidates who can raise early campaign
contributions have an edge.
   The other political ramifications of an early California primary
are subject to debate. California voters tend to be more liberal
than those in New Hampshire, but the state is much closer to the
national average than its image suggests.
   A big early Western primary could also focus more attention in
presidential races on Western issues such as trade relations with
the Far East and offshore oil drilling and other environmental
issues.
   The last time the state proved crucial in the primaries was
1972, when George McGovern's California victory over Hubert
Humphrey gave him his narrow margin of victory for the Democratic
nomination.
   Barry Goldwater's victory over Nelson Rockefeller in
California's 1964 primary was the last time the state played a role
in picking the GOP nominee.

<HEAD>Former Strongman Fights To Run For President</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALFONSO ANZUETO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GUATEMALA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former military ruler is challenging a
decision barring him from running for president this fall, saying
he will use all legal means to get on the ballot.
   Efrain Rios Montt, a retired general, said the ruling Wednesday
by the national election board is ``a decision by a group of
citizens who are unaware of what the true rule of law is.''
   Speaking to a news conference shortly after the ruling, he said
the conservative three-party coalition fielding him will appeal.
   By law, Rios Montt has three days to appeal through the courts.
His coalition of the Democratic Institutional Party, National Unity
Front and Guatemalan Republican Front has until Sept. 12 _ the
deadline _ to get him registered.
   A born-again Christian, Rios Montt was one of a long line of
rightist military strongmen who ruled Guatemala for more than three
decades until Vinicio Cerezo, a civilian Christian Democrat, was
elected for a five-year term in January 1986.
   Rios Montt succeeded Fernando Romeo Lucas Garcia, another army
general, in a March 1982 military coup until the army replaced him
with Gen. Oscar Humberto Mejia in August 1983.
   Election board officials, at a heavily guarded news conference,
announced the decision to ban the candidacy of Rios Montt. Board
chairman Felix Castillo Milla said the ruling was based on
provisions in the Guatemalan Constitution.
   Castillo Milla cited legislation stipulating that ``neither the
head and leaders of a coup, armed revolution or similar movement
that has altered the constitutional order, nor those who have
assumed the head of government as a result, can run for president
or vice-president of the republic.''
   In a non-binding opinion asked by Congress last year, the
Supreme Court held that Rios Montt is barred from serving as
president or vice president because of the constitutional ban.
   In his 17 months as president, Rios Montt cracked down hard on
leftist guerrillas and common criminals, and executed more than a
dozen leftists by firing squad.
   Among these were five, shot during a visit by Pope John Paul II
to Guatemala, despite a plea by the pontiff that he spare their
lives.
   In his bid for a comeback, Rios Montt has been waging a tough
law-and-order campaign.
   This has given him a strong good showing in opinion polls among
voters fed up with Guatemala rising crime rate, but has activists
worried that he might win and his eye-for-an-eye brand of justice
could lead to further abuses in a country already plagued with them.
   Guatemala City's mayor, Alvaro Arizu Irigoyen of the National
Advance Party, is the only candidate the board has approved so far.
It still has to rule on applications by Jorge Carpio Nicolle and at
least six other candidates.
   Carpio Nicolle, a journalist running for a coalition of the
National Center Union and the National Authentic Central Party,
lost to Cerezo four years ago.
   If no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast in the Nov. 11
balloting, the election will be decided by a runoff Jan. 6.

<TEXT>
   President Bush says he has no
intentions of giving up vacation jaunts on his power boat, but he
does want Americans to conserve energy _ and enjoy their summer
vacations.
   Bush said during a news conference at his vacation home on
Wednesday that there is no reason to expect an oil shortage,
despite a reduction in world oil supplies cause by Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait and a subsequent international embargo on Iraqi trade.
   ``I'm going to keep using my boat, and I hope the rest of
America will prudently recreate,'' said Bush, who has taken
excursions on his boat fidelity during his vacation.
   ``I don't think we've reached the point where I want to call on
everybody in the recreation industry to shut it down or everybody
that's taking a vacation in America to shut it down,'' the
president said.
   Persian Gulf tensions have meant a 4.2 million-barrel daily
reduction in oil on the world market. But there had been a supply
glut, and other oil producing nations are expected to make up much
of the shortfall.
   Before Iraq invaded Kuwait, the United States was importing
between 600,000 and 700,000 barrels per day from the two nations,
about 4 percent of total U.S. oil consumption. There are 42 gallons
of oil in a barrel.
   Bush declined to say what conservation measures he favors. Last
week Energy Secretary James D. Watkins proposed boosting U.S. oil
production, while asking drivers to trim their gasoline use by
keeping tires properly inflated and obeying speed limits.
   ``We're doing everything we can to guarantee that we don't panic
Americans and that there will be an adequate supply of
hydrocarbons,'' the president said.
   ``I think it is a good time to conserve, so I'm glad you
reminded me of that and I would call upon Americans to conserve,''
Bush said in response to a question. ``That doesn't mean that life
screeches to a halt.''

<HEAD>Envoy Says King Hussein Lacks Credibility for Mediation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kuwait's ambassador to the United States is
accusing Jordan of collaborating with the Iraqis, even offering to
help them take airliners captured in his occupied nation.
   ``I don't think that the credibility of His Majesty King Hussein
is any longer of any value,'' Sheikh Saud Nasir Al-Sabah told a
Washington news conference on Wednesday, hours after the monarch
announced in Amman he would embark on a new round of talks with
Arab leaders to defuse the crisis.
   ``It's quite evident to us now that he (Hussein) is condoning
... the occupation of Kuwait by Iraq, he is condoning the taking of
hostages by the Iraqi regime,'' the envoy added.
   Sheikh Saud said King Hussein apparently fears ``that the Iraqis
will come out before the whole world and expose what I would term
... a regional conspiracy'' between Iraq and Jordan.
   The envoy promised more details of this in the future. But as an
example of ``the collaboration of the Jordanian regime with Iraq,''
he said only Tuesday Jordan volunteered to send pilots to Kuwait to
ferry Kuwait's fleet of Airbus airliners to Iraq.
   ``The Iraqis don't have pilots so experienced in Airbuses and
the Jordanians have volunteered to come and fly and take the loot
out and take them to Baghdad,'' he said.

<HEAD>U.N. Shakes Off Cold War Paralysis to Act with Resolve in Gulf
Crisis</HEAD>
<HEAD>AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Nations has emerged from
decades of Cold-War paralysis to act with resolve in the Persian
Gulf crisis, fulfilling the mission envisioned by its founders:
keeping the peace.
   The 15-member Security Council, which has the primary
responsibility for preserving peace, has acted with unprecedented
decisiveness in taking action to counter the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait, largely as a result of the recent U.S.-Soviet
rapprochement, diplomats say.
   Although the Soviet Union counsels caution and the United States
urges swift approval of a resolution allowing military force to
back up U.N. sanctions against Iraq, the superpowers have largely
acted in concert during the crisis.
   Since Iraqi troops moved into Kuwait on Aug. 2, the Security
Council had adopted four resolutions with near unanimity.
   The council has denounced the invasion, declared an
international economic boycott of Iraq, rejected Iraq's proclaimed
annexation of Kuwait, and demanded that all foreigners in Iraq and
Kuwait be allowed to go home.
   Spearheaded by its five permanent members _ the United States,
the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France _ the council also met
abruptly Monday night for informal consultations and successfully
put pressure on Yemen, the council's only Arab member, to refuse to
allow an Iraqi tanker to unload.
   ``We are seeing unprecedented cooperation within the Security
Council,'' U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering said recently. ``And
we want to preserve consensus.''
   For the first time since the United Nations was created 45 years
ago, the moribund Military Staff Committee of the Security Council
is showing signs of life. The committee consists of military
officers of the five permanent council members to coordinate U.N.
enforcement actions, but it has never had an active role, even in
the 1950-53 Korean War.
   The ``Big Five'' council members are exchanging information
about the naval situation in the Gulf.
   The Soviets have said in recent discussions that Soviet forces
would be engaged in the Gulf only in the context of an
authorization from the United Nations. They want the Military Staff
Committee to play a role in overseeing any military action.
   The United States has been less enthusiastic about this
proposal, preferring that U.S. forces preserve their prerogative
for independent military action.
   The United States, Britain and France were supportive of a
unique resolution that would provide a U.N. umbrella, but not a
U.N. flag and command, for international warships enforcing the
embargo.
   China has joined the Soviets in urging that enforcement go
slowly, and that any actions are taken in accordance with the U.N.
Charter.
   For nearly four years, the Big Five have been meeting informally
at least twice a month in what has been called a ``tea party'' _ a
behind-the-scenes get together to shape the formal, public council
meetings.
   In the current crisis, the permanent members have been meeting
almost daily, and sometimes twice a day, to coordinate strategy and
resolve their differences.
   With the easing of tensions between the superpowers, the
Security Council has found it easier to reach a consensus regarding
other regional conflicts _the Iran-Iraq war, Namibia, Central
America, Cambodia and the Western Sahara.
   The move toward consensus first became apparent in July 1987
when the Security Council adopted Resolution 598 demanding a
cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war. But back then the five permanent
members still found themselves divided over how to enforce the
resolution and unable to move beyond rhetoric.
   The Soviet Union was selling arms to Iraq, China was selling
arms to Iran and Iraq, and both were unwilling to stop.
   Iran finally agreed to the U.N. cease-fire and peace plan
because it was exhausted by the war, not because of Security
Council enforcement, analysts say.
   The first time the council acted with unanimity was in 1951 in
Korea, when the council authorized the United States to command an
international force after North Korean forces invaded South Korea.
   However, the Soviet Union was absent from the council meeting
that approved the U.S.-led force.
   In the Cold War years, the United States and Soviet Union both
used their vetos in the Security Council to block resolutions
considered detrimental to their interests, and the United Nations'
role in peacekeeping became less effective.

<HEAD>Barry Jury Divided, Questioning Evidence Uncontested in Court,
Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jurors deliberating 14 drug and perjury
charges against Mayor Marion Barry were so divided on a possible
verdict that they even argued over points not contested by either
side, a published report says.
   Examining evidence in the trial that resulted in Barry being
convicted on one misdemeanor cocaine possession count, acquitted on
another and in a mistrial on the other 12 counts, the jury divided
into a strong pro-conviction camp and an equally strong
pro-acquittal camp, The Washington Post reported in today's
editions.
   In the third day of deliberations, the jury argued over whether
the substance Barry was videotaped smoking from a pipe was really
crack cocaine, or whether it was baking soda or sugar, the
newspaper quoted jurors as saying.
   One bloc of five middle-aged and older black jurors voiced a
deep distrust of the government's case, agreeing with Barry's
claims that he was ``set up'' by white government officials out to
get black politicians.
   The other bloc believed the evidence against Barry was so
overwhelming it had no choice but to convict.
   During the debate over the white rocklike substance in an
evidence bag that even Barry's lawyer, Kenneth Mundy, did not
dispute was crack cocaine, one juror walked away in disgust, the
Post said.
   ``How do you change someone's mind when they look at an evidence
bag there's crack in, and they say it's not crack?'' said one juror.
   Although Barry's defense, as well as the pro-acquittal block of
jurors, believed the mayor was on trial because of his race, the
pro-conviction bloc of jurors included four black women, all 40 or
younger. The two whites voted predominantly for conviction, the
Post said.
   On the deadlocked counts, the closest the jurors came to
conviction was 10 to 2, the newspaper said. The closest they came
to acquittal was 9 to 3. The remaining undecided counts split 6 to
6 and 7 to 5.

<TEXT>
   Next month's Asian Games are expected to test
Iraq's ability to force international recognition of the Baghdad
government's claimed annexation of Kuwait.
   On Wednesday, Kuwait's foreign minister ruled out any
possibility of sending a joint Kuwait-Iraq team to the 11th Asian
Games, which open in Beijing on Sept. 22.
   That leaves open the chance that the government-in-exile will
send one team and the Iraqi-installed administration in Kuwait will
send another.
   The Kuwait Embassy in Beijing, which represents the
government-in-exile, said Kuwait's soccer team was training outside
Kuwait at the time of the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion and could attend
the games. The whereabouts of other Kuwaiti athletes, however,
remain unknown.
   According to the constitution of the Olympic Council of Asia,
all 38 member nations are entitled to send athletes to compete in
the Asian Games, the spokesman for the games organizing committee,
Wu Zhongyuan, said in an interview.
   But if two teams claiming to represent Kuwait show up, the
council _ not China _ would have to decide which team was
legitimate, Wu said.
   ``Whoever the OCA recognizes, we will recognize,'' he said,
adding that there has been no offical discussion of the issue yet.
The earliest a decision might be made would be Sept. 19, when the
council's 12-member bureau plans to hold a special meeting in
Beijing to select an acting president.
   The council's president, Sheik Fahad Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, was
killed Aug. 2 while defending the Kuwaiti royal residence from
invading Iraqi troops. The sheik, brother of Kuwait's ruler, was to
have presided over the Asian Games.
   The Chinese organizers so far are continuing to recognize the
exiled government. At a trial award ceremony a few days ago, the
Kuwait flag was raised and national anthem played, the embassy said.

<HEAD>Liberian Rebel Threats Keep West African Task Force in Harbor</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   West African leaders have failed to
arrange a truce in the Liberian civil war with rebel chief Charles
Taylor, whose threats have kept a West African military force from
intervening in the conflict.
   Taylor refused to attend the talks Wednesday in Banjul and
reportedly told journalists in rebel-held Liberian territory that
the peace plan was a ploy to keep President Samuel Doe in power in
Monrovia, the Liberian capital.
   Taylor's representative at the talks, Tom Woeiyou, vowed after
the negotiations broke down that the rebel faction would try to
repel ``with all the force we can muster'' a military unit
organized by the West African leaders to halt the 8-month-old war
that has claimed more than 5,000 lives.
   The intervention force has been waiting to set sail from
Freetown in Sierra Leone _ another West African country _ for
several days.
   Taylor threatens to attack any foreign troops who intervene in
the conflict. His forces invaded from Ivory Coast on Dec. 24 to
oust Doe, who they call corrupt.
   Sources close to the negotiations said Lt. Gen. Arnold Quianoo
of Ghana, commander of the West African task force, was deciding
whether his soldiers should fight their way into Monrovia, given
the casualties and damage that would result.
   President Joseph Momoh of Sierra Leone visited about 3,000
soldiers from Gambia, Ghana, Nigeria and Sierra Leone in Freetown
on Wednesday night. Official sources said the troops were due to
leave on troop transports from Freetown Wednesday night, but hours
later the ships remained at anchor.
   Other countries contributing troops to the West African force
are Guinea and Togo.
   Doe and Taylor's rebel rival, Prince Johnson, welcome the West
African intervention. They declared a cease-fire Monday that would
help the task force since Johnson's men control Monrovia's port
area.
   West African leaders decided to intervene Aug. 6. They said the
war was no longer an internal conflict because thousands of their
citizens were trapped in Monrovia and about 400,000 Liberian
refugees were burdening neighboring states.
   The sources spoke Wednesday on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Aoun Calls For Overthrow Of Hrawi Government After Constitutional
Changes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rebel Christian general fighting the
government has called for a coup after Parliament approved
constitutional changes that would give Christians and Moslems an
equal share of power.
   The reform backed by President Elias Hrawi's Syrian-backed
government is aimed at ending a 15-year-old civil war in which
Moslems have been demanding a greater share of power now that they
are in the majority.
   ``There is an urgent need to overthrow the West Beirut
government,'' rebel Gen. Michel Aoun said Wednesday. ``The
parliamentary session yesterday was the last chapter of a
conspiracy against Lebanon,'' Aoun's Radio Lebanon quoted the him
as saying. It did not elaborate.
   The reform plan approved Tuesday was worked out by Lebanese
legislators under Arab League auspices in 23 days of deliberations
at the Saudi Arabian town of Taif in October.
   Aoun has rejected the Taif peace plan along with Hrawi's
election as president with strong Syrian backing Nov. 24.
   Hrawi, a Maronite Catholic like Aoun, was forced to set up
temporary residence in Moslem West Beirut because the maverick
general has refused to withdraw from the presidential palace, the
seat of Lebanese heads of state in the Christian suburb of Baabda
east of Beirut.
   The leader of a rival Christian militia, Samir Geagea, has
welcomed the peace plan and recognized Hrawi as head of state.
Geagea is also a Maronite.
   The Maronites, the largest Christian sect in Lebanon, have
traditionally dominated the nation since independence from France
in 1943, when the Christians were a majority.
   The Moslems, who say they now make up 55 percent of the nation's
4 million population, have been fighting for equal rights since a
civil war that broke out in 1975. More than 130,000 people have
died.

   U.S. District Judge Robert Aguilar risks
impeachment and up to 10 years in prison after being convicted of
leaking a wiretap to a former mobster and lying to the FBI.
   Aguilar, 59, on Wednesday became the third federal judge
convicted of a felony in the last decade.
   He was acquitted of three other charges, including the main one,
that he agreed to use his influence with a fellow judge on behalf
of a former Teamsters leader convicted of embezzlement.
   The federal jury deliberated more than four days. It was the
second time Aguilar was tried on the charges. At his first trial,
in March, a jury deadlocked on seven charges and acquitted him of
one.
   Aguilar, 59, who was appointed by President Carter in 1980,
could get five years in prison and a $250,000 on each offense at
sentencing Nov. 1.
   Aguilar also could be impeached and removed from office by
Congress unless the convictions are overturned on appeal.
   Defense lawyer Paul Meltzer said he expected to appeal. He
refused to say if Aguilar might resign to avoid impeachment.
   ``I think it ends a long and distinguished career,'' Meltzer
said of the verdict. ``I don't think we're going to see Judge
Aguilar continue as a federal judge after his sentencing, unless
something happens at a later date.''
   In 1984, U.S. District Judge Harry Claiborne of Nevada was
convicted of tax evasion, and in 1986, U.S. District Judge Walter
Nixon of Mississippi was convicted of perjury. Both were impeached
and removed by Congress, the only way a federal judge can be forced
out under the Constitution.
   U.S. District Judge Alcee Hastings of Florida was acquitted in
1983 of conspiring to solicit a bribe, but he was removed from
office based on a congressional finding of perjury.
   Aguilar was convicted of two cover-up charges:
   _ Disclosing to Abe Chapman, an ex-mobster and a former relative
of Aguilar by marriage, in 1988 that Chapman was the subject of a
wiretap in an investigation of former Teamsters leader Rudy Tham.
Aguilar denied intentionally disclosing wiretap information and
said he was only trying to warn Chapman to stay away from Tham.
   _ Attempting to obstruct a grand jury in 1988 by lying to FBI
agents who asked him about the wiretap and his involvement in
Tham's case.
   Aguilar was acquitted of charges that he disclosed wiretap
information to Chapman in 1987 and that he advised Tham's lawyer to
lie to the grand jury by denying he had discussed Tham's case with
Aguilar.
   Aguilar, of San Jose, one of 11 children of poor Mexican
immigrants, had established a reputation as a liberal judge. He
ruled against the government in restricting immigration sweeps on
factories and forbidding the exclusion of a homosexual from the
country.
   Aguilar was freed without bail and left the court without
speaking to reporters.

<HEAD>New Test Finds Abnormal Buildup of Fiber in Body</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists today reported finding a way to zero in
on abnormal buildups of fibrous deposits and said the procedure may
someday lead to a better test for Alzheimer's disease.
   Doctors in England used a natural blood protein joined with a
radioactive isotope to find the buildups, known as amyloid
deposits. The combination locked onto the fibers so they show up on
pictures taken with a camera that is sensitive to radioactivity.
   Initially, at least, the procedure will be used to diagnose
systemic amyloidosis. In this disorder, proteins fail to break down
properly and slowly accumulate in tissues, where they form damaging
fibers.
   Though the disease is believed to be rare, its incidence is not
precisely known because it is so difficult to identify. But
diagnosing the disease has become important because researchers
have developed treatments for it.
   The new test is the first safe method of locating and fully
diagnosing amyloid deposits without cutting the body, said Dr. Mark
B. Pepys of Hammersmith Hospital in London, a co-author of the
report in The New England Journal of Medicine.
   Until now, the only way to diagnose systemic amyloidosis was to
stick a needle into the body, draw out tissue and look at it under
a microscope. However, it is easy to miss the deposits, and the
biopsy does not reveal the extent of the disease throughout the
body.
   Alzheimer's disease, the leading cause of senility, is
associated with amyloid deposits in the brain and can be difficult
to diagnosis in its early stages.
   Pepys said that researchers have so far been unsuccessful in
using the new test to diagnose this disorder, probably because of
the difficulty of getting enough of the radioactive material
through the bloodstream into the brain.
   ``That is one of our objectives,'' Pepys said. ``I believe in
principle it could be successful. It is probably just a matter of
getting the technology right.''
   In the test, doctors bond a normal blood protein known as serum
amyloid P component with iodine-123. The blood protein, together
with its radioactive tag, bind to the fiber deposits throughout the
body.
   When the researchers tried the test on 50 people with systemic
amyloidosis, it appeared to identify the extent of the deposits in
all of them. However, it did not falsely suggest these deposits in
36 people without the disease.
   In an accompanying editorial in the journal, Drs. Alan S. Cohen
and Martha Skinner of Boston University School of Medicine said the
discovery appears to be ``a test of exquisite sensitivity.''
   While it probably will not replace biopsies, they said it will
be useful when biopsies turn up negative but doctors still suspect
amyloidosis. It also may be effective for checking the progress of
treatment.

<TEXT>
   A Lebanese man arrested as a suspect in the
1986 bombing of a West Berlin discotheque that led to U.S. air
raids on Libya has been released for lack of evidence, officials
said.
   The suspect, identified by authorities as Ali Mansur, was
arrested July 25 on a tip from a former East German secret police
source linking Mansur with the April 5, 1986 attack on the La Belle
disco.
   However, West Berlin officials issued a statement Wednesday
saying the tip from the former secret police was based on
third-hand information obtained from other sources.
   Under West German law, the information was insufficient to
justify the continued arrest of the suspect, the statement said.
   The United States blamed Libya for the bombing of the disco,
which killed two U.S. soldiers and a Turkish woman and injured 229
people.
   The United States retaliated 10 days later by sending warplanes
to bomb the Libyan cities of Tripoli and Benghazi. Western
diplomats say more than 100 people were killed in the air raids.
   According to West Berlin justice officials, at least five other
people are still being sought in the La Belle disco case.

<TEXT>
   A weed called feverfew causes itchy, runny
noses and watery eyes for millions, just like ragweed, a researcher
says. But unlike ragweed, the newly recognized allergy has no cure
yet.
   Worse, the feverfew allergy is often misdiagnosed as that of
ragweed, meaning many patients pay for treatments that do no good,
said Dr. H. James Wedner.
   Feverfew, also called the Santa Clara feverfew, is a ``basically
just ugly'' scrub plant that sprouts from cracks in pavement,
Wedner said.
   ``It grows in the same areas as ragweed, at the same time of
year, and the symptoms are basically the same _ very unpleasant,''
he said, estimating the plant's pollen causes problems for 2
million people in the Gulf Coast states.
   Wedner's findings were published recently in the Journal of
Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Wedner is a physician with the
division of allergy and immunology at the Washington University
School of Medicine in St. Louis.
   In the late summer and early fall, feverfew spreads misery from
southeastern Texas across the Gulf States to southern Florida,
doctors said. The plant has been found up to 300 miles inland.
   Wedner said it appears the plant originated in Mexico and spread
northward and eastward. The plant also has spread to Asia, Africa
and Australia, he said.
   The plant was identified as an allergen producer in the early
1900s, Wedner said, but the conventional wisdom then was that
feverfew pollen was too sticky and clumpy to become widely
scattered in the air.
   Either that assumption was wrong, or the plant is changing.
   ``There are plants, and feverfew may be one of them, that are
evolving,'' said Dr. Jean Chapman, co-chairman of the aerobiology
committee of the American Academy of Allergy and Immunology.
``Feverfew was thought to be insect-pollinated and now we know it
is airborne.''
   ``It's definitely a significant allergen,'' said Dr. Gary N.
Gross, an allergist with Baylor University in Dallas. ``It's
probably something that we just haven't paid enough attention to.''
   Wedner said it could take a couple years to produce a treatment.

<HEAD>They're Back: Parasites That Devastated Vineyards 100 Years Ago</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAPA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The wine bug phylloxera that devastated the
world's vineyards a century ago is back, and experts say California
vintners may have to spend about $500 million during the next
decade to thwart the pest.
   ``It's costly, but they will just have to bite the bullet,''
Jeffrey Grannett, an entomologist on the University of California's
Phylloxera Task Force, said Wednesday. ``It's the type of thing
that's going to be widely felt over many years.''
   Vintners in Sonoma and Napa counties, California's premium
wine-growing areas, are getting ready to replant vineyards with
vines resistant to phylloxera (pronounced fih-LOX-eh-rah), a
burrowing plant louse.
   The cost of the replanting over the next decade could reach $500
million, said Vic Motto of Motto, Kryla &amp; Fisher, a wine industry
accounting firm.
   Motto partner Mike Fisher estimated that more than 13,000 acres
of vineyard will be replanted in the Napa Valley alone.
   There have been 90 sightings of the pest in the valley and 12 in
Sonoma County, Fisher wrote recently in the trade publication Wine
Industry Update.
   ``Though the threat appears to be real, its effect to date had
been minimal, with approximately 100 acres removed,'' he said.
   Fisher said some growers have used an insecticide that slows the
spread of the pest but does not eliminate it. Replanting costs up
to $15,000 an acre and means three to five years of lost production
while the new vines reach maturity.
   The wine-growing regions of France and California were ruined by
phylloxera between 1870 and 1900. Vineyard acreage dropped from
20,000 to 3,000 in the fledging industry in Napa County.
   Fisher said that while the cost of replanting is high, it is
unlikely that phylloxera will devastate the industry as it did a
century ago.
   In the 1890s the use of phylloxera-resistant root stock was new
and the Napa Valley wine industry wasn't world-class, so many of
the vineyards were not replanted.

<HEAD>Report: European Hostage To Be Freed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The official Iranian news agency reported
today that a European hostage held in Lebanon would be freed in the
next few hours.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency, quoting an ``informed
source,'' said the hostage to be freed was likely to be Brian
Keenan, an Irish national held since April 1986.
   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, did not name the source but
correspondents in both its Beirut and Damascus office said the
report was accurate. They said they did not know specifically when
the release would take place.
   The news agency carried a similar report on an imminent release
in July, which proved false.
   In Beirut, a source close to the Syrian command, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the Syrian government was notified two
days ago of the decision to free a European hostage, probably
Keenan.
   He said arrangements have since been discussed on where, when
and how the release will take place.
   The source said he believes the hostage will be handed to the
Syrian authorities somewhere in Lebanon and he will be delivered by
the Foreign Ministry in Damascus to the Irish ambassador there.
   In Dublin, the Department of Foreign Affairs said, ``We are
aware of the report and would point to its speculative nature.''
   Gerben Meihuizen, the Dutch ambassador to Syria, said he had
``no confirmation'' of the report. The Netherlands handles Irish
interests in Damascus while their non-resident ambassador, Declan
Connolly, is based in Riyadh.
   A source at the ministry of information in Damascus said they
had no immediate information about the release.
   Keenan's family in Northern Ireland reacted cautiously to the
report.
   Keenan, 39, was kidnapped on April 11, 1986 in west Beirut while
walking to his job as an English teacher at the American University
in Beirut.
   Altogether 14 Westerners are believed held by extremist Moslem
groups in Lebanon. In addition to Keenan, they include six
Americans, four Britons, two West Germans and an Italian. The
longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of
The Associated Press, who was abducted March 16, 1985.
   Two Swiss Red Cross workers were released separately earlier
this month.

<HEAD>Atlantic Salmon Caught in Southeast Alaska Stirs Concern</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Biologists have documented the first catch
of an Atlantic salmon in Alaska waters, raising fears that escaped
fish from commercial farms will introduce diseases dangerous to the
state's valuable native species.
   A troller caught the Atlantic salmon July 20 near Cross Sound,
about 75 miles west of Juneau. Federal biologists confirmed the
identification this week.
   The biologists suspect the fish, an immature female of less than
3 pounds, escaped from a commercial salmon farm in British Columbia
or Washington state. They concluded the fish was probably raised in
a pen because of scale abrasions, a fin that may have been clipped,
and its scale growth pattern.
   ``The risk is based on how many of these fish have escaped and
how many happen to carry a disease not indigenous to the
Northwest,'' said biologist Ken Leon of the state Department of
Fish and Game. ``It's not a good situation if it happens in large
numbers.''
   Dale Kelley, executive director of the Alaska Trollers
Association, said commercial fishermen also are worried about the
possibility of disease. The group will wait to see whether more
Atlantic salmon turn up, she said.
   Biologist Bruce Wing of the National Marine Fisheries Service
said it's unlikely a significant population of Atlantic salmon
could become established in southeastern Alaska. Huge populations
of native salmon would have an overwhelming advantage, he said.
   Like their Pacific salmon cousins, Atlantic salmon are born in
fresh water, spend most of their lives in salt water, and then
return to fresh water to spawn. Unlike Pacific salmon, they don't
always die after spawning.
   Wing and Leon said they did not know if Atlantic salmon could
mate with Pacific salmon and produce viable offspring.
   The Legislature this year banned commercial salmon farming in
the state. Commercial pens are common in southern British Columbia.

   Rain was scattered today along the East Coast, and thunderstorms
rumbled through Georgia and North Dakota.
   Dry weather prevailed over much of the West and the nation's
midsection. Skies were mostly clear over the West, but cloud
formations built up over the Plains and the Midwest.
   A slow-moving front packing thunderstorms threatened to bring
fresh flooding to parts of West Virginia and Pennsylvania. The
unsettled weather was expected to remain over the region until
Friday, forecasters said.
   In western West Virginia Wednesday, flooding damaged roads and
houses and washed out a road bridge in Wayne County, authorities
said.
   Today's forecast called for rain along the Appalachians from
North Carolina and Tennessee into central Pennsyvania.
   Showers and thunderstorms in the Southeast are likely to cool
afternoon heat in the region.
   Sweltering temperatures were likely along the Texas-Louisiana
Gulf coast, and in the desert Southwest. Cool weather will again
prevail in the Northwest.
   The nation's high on Wednesday was 109 degrees at Borrego

   Tens of thousands of chanting Indian
immigrants greeted their militant political leader todaqy after
marauding gunmen opened fire on a similar gathering and killed at
least 28 people.
   Police said they arrested at least 16 people in Wednesday's
shooting spree, which injured at least 50 supporters preparing for
the return of their leader, Altaf Hussein.
   No one claimed responsibility for the attack. Authorities have
been careful not to place blame, fearing it could set off another
round of ethnic violence that has claimed more than 500 lives since
May.
   Hussein, 36, the leader of the militant Mohajir Qami Movement
(Refugee People's Movement), was in London undergoing treatment for
a kidney ailment during the last wave of violence.
   An estimated 40,000 supporters crowded into Karachi
International Airport and blocked the surrounding streets to greet
Hussein.
   All markets and businesses in Karachi, the country's financial
and industrial center, closed. Hundreds of police and army troops
in riot gear patrolled the streets.
   The Mohajir Qami Movment represents Indian immigrants to
Pakistan following the 1947 partition that ended British colonial
rule of the subcontinent. It is demanding recognition as Pakistan's
fifth nationality, along with the Pathans, Baluch, Punjabis and
Sindhis.
   A planned procession from the airport to Hussein's home was
canceled after Wednesday's shootings. Gunmen on motorcycles opened
fire on booths that were being set up across the city for Hussein's
arrival.
   ``Everybody knows who was behind it,'' Hussein told a news
conference. But he refused to name anyone.
   ``This was done to harass and destroy peace of the city that was
returning after the dismissal of (former Prime Minister) Benazir
Bhutto,'' he said. ``The MQM may be the target but all democratic
forces will suffer.''
   For years, this southern port city of 9 million people has been
an urban battlefield between rival ethnic and political groups.
Authorities estimate more than 2,000 people have been killed and
thousands more injured since 1985.
   President Ghulman Ishaq Khan dismissed Ms. Bhutto's governnment
on Aug. 6. One reason he cited was the inability to stop the
killings in Karachi, Ms. Bhutto's hometown.
   The MQM was once Ms. Bhutto's ally. But after citing a litnay of
alleged broken promises, the MQM withdrew its support and joined
her opposition.
   The MQM and Ms. Bhutto's left-of-center party clashed several
times, and the army was called out in May to restore peace.
Soldiers returned to their barracks Sunday.

<HEAD>Man's Dedication To Lover Sparks Dispute</HEAD>

   Michael Davies wanted to dedicate a song to
his companion Michael, but a Pittsburgh radio station balked over
inserting the words ``my lover.''
   In a complaint to the city's Human Relations Commission, Davies
accused WSHH-FM of violating a city code amended in March to ban
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.
   Davies called the station's phone-in line on July 19, asking
disc jockey Leah Klocko to air a song with the dedication, ``From
Michael to my lover Michael.''
   ``She was willing to honor my request if I agreed to disguise
the fact that it was for another man,'' Davies said. But to remove
the word ``lover'' would make it sound ``I was dedicating the song
to myself,'' he said.
   Ms. Klocko said she didn't care that the dedication was to
another man. She objected to the term ``lover.''
   ``I don't do any dedications with the word lover,'' she said.
``We want to keep the show romance, not sexual.''
   Asked why her show is called ``Wish for Lovers,'' Ms. Klocko
said, ``We can't very well say `Wish for boyfriends and
girlfriends.' It's just the way the title came out.''
   The commission examined the complaint Tuesday but made no
decision, giving the radio station a week to come up with a
settlement.
   ``We're more than happy to say this song goes out from Michael
to Michael,'' said Chris Ackerman, the station's general manager.
``We wouldn't say from Michael to his lover Michael any more than
we would say from Bill to his main squeeze Jane.''
   Ackerman said the station did not discriminate against Davies
and will state in writing that it will not discriminate on the
basis of sexual orientation.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge today struck down Guam's
virtual ban on abortion as unconstitutional. The measure was the
nation's most restrictive abortion law.
   U.S. District Judge Alex Munson declared that Roe vs. Wade, the
1973 Supreme Court decision establishing the right to an abortion,
``applied with equal force and effect to Guam.''
   The law, signed by Gov. Joseph Ada on March 19, banned abortions
except when the mother's life is in danger. But Munson on March 23
blocked its enforcement while he weighed a challenge to the law
from abortion-rights forces.
   The law carried a penalty of up to a year in jail and a $1,000
fine for obtaining an illegal abortion or soliciting a woman to
have an abortion. Performing an illegal abortion was punishable by
up to five years in prison.
   Two days after the law went into effect, an American Civil
Liberties Union lawyer, Janet Benshoof of New York, was charged
with violating the measure by publicly encouraging women to seek
abortions in Hawaii. The charges later were dropped; prosecutors
said the lawsuit challenging the law was a higher priority.
   The governor said he did not know whether he would appeal
today's ruling.
   ``I'm still very pro-life, and I believe that a fetus is a human
being and should be given life,'' said Ada, a Roman Catholic like
the vast majority of Guam's residents.
   The challenge to the law was brought by an unidentified pregnant
woman who wanted an abortion, the Guam Society of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists, the Guam Nurses Association, an Episcopal priest and
three doctors.
   Anita Arriola, a lawyer for the abortion-rights side, had argued
that the law _ introduced by her mother, territorial Sen. Elizabeth
Arriola _ was contrary to Roe vs. Wade and was passed to promote a
particular religious belief.
   Katherine A. Maraman, representing the government of this U.S.
possession in the Western Pacific, had argued that 99 percent of
all abortions on Guam were not necessary but were for the
convenience of the mother.
   In his ruling, Munson said sections of the law are vague and
that the provision against soliciting an abortion violates the
right to free speech.
   Arriola said the decision ``sends a very clear signal to
Governor Ada and the Guam Legislature and other legislatures around
the country.''
   ``This decision means that Roe vs. Wade is still the law of the
land,'' said Lou Leon Guerrero, president of People for Choice.
   Dawn C. Leon Guerrero, chairwoman of the Guam Pro-Life
Coalition, said she expected the ruling, ``because the judge has to
follow legal precedent.''
   ``We figured that it wouldn't be an easy climb,'' said Roland
Rivera, vice president of Guamanians United for Life. ``There is
just the next higher level to pursue.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The hotel industry is howling over a state
agency's request that its employees take unused soap and shampoo
from hotels and donate it to the homeless.
   The leader of an organization for the homeless also criticized
the plan, saying it doesn't seriously help the needy.
   A division of the state Department of Public Aid adopted a
policy asking its workers to contribute unused toiletries
voluntarily, and an agency-wide policy might be next, department
spokesman Dean Schott said Wednesday.
   The Hotel-Motel Association of Illinois objected.
   ``Where would you draw the line?'' asked Arnold Karr, the
group's executive director. ``The next thing that will be taken
will be the other amenities _ glasses, towels, bath mats, throw
rugs and furniture.''
   Karr said it might be better to ask hotels and motels for
contributions instead.
   Les Brown, executive director of the Chicago Coalition for the
Homeless, said other issues _ the need for jobs, affordable housing
and revitalized communities _ are more pressing.
   ``It's one thing to think about giving soap to the homeless
people, but where are they going to use it?'' Brown asked.
   Despite the criticism, the state agency _ which spends $7.1
million annually on programs for an estimated 80,000 homeless in
Illinois _ still may ask every employee to contribute the unused
toiletries, Schott said.
   ``The idea was to focus on those items that are complimentary
and free,'' Schott said. ``And I have to emphasize that it is on a
voluntary basis.''
   Schott said the soap would be distributed to homeless shelters
around the state.

<HEAD>Stocks Post Fourth-Worst Loss; Dollar Also Lower</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices nose-dived in Tokyo for the second day
in a row today as panicky investors dumped their holdings amid
increasing fears the Persian Gulf crisis will harm the economy. The
dollar also closed lower.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average closed at 23,737.63, falling
1,473.28 points, or 5.84 percent, in its fourth-largest loss. That
marked the lowest closing since Feb. 9, 1988, when the index was at
23,662.27.
   About 450 million shares changed hands on the first section
today in light trading.
   Today's decline followed Wednesday's 1,086.93-point loss and
placed the index 39 percent below its record 38,915.87-point close
Dec. 28, 1989. The drop has erased $1.4 trillion from the value of
Tokyo stocks.
   Meanwhile, the dollar closed at 145.88 yen, down 1.04 from
Wednesday's finish at 146.92 yen. The currency opened at 145.95 yen
and ranged between 145.80 and 146.40.
   Analysts and traders say the massive stock slide will shrink
company profits and individual consumption. They expect capital to
further flow from the stock market with rising interest rates and
investors' fear of inflation because of soaring oil prices.
   The stock decline today began in early morning as investors
heard reports that Saudi Arabia might stop September oil delivery
to Japan, traders said. Japan depends on imports from the Middle
East for about 70 percent of its oil needs.
   The index's decline also was linked to bond market weakness,
higher oil prices and Wall Street's performance, said Yoshiro
Inoue, an analyst with Nomura Securities Co.
   Brent crude for October delivery was valued at $30.70 to $30.90
a barrel at about 3 p.m. (2 a.m. EDT). This was higher than the
$30.25-a-barrel level seen late Wednesday in New York.
   The benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese government bond has gone
from 7.480 percent on Aug. 1 to 8.250 percent today. Increased
interest payments will slow down capital expenditures by businesses
and in turn slow down growth, analysts say.
   Pessimism over the effect of the Middle East crisis on the
Japanese economy prompted many institutional investors, who are
under pressure to minimize losses before their account settlement
in September, to liquidate their funds before they lose more, Nikko
Securities' Hashizume explained.
   Individual investors also dumped issues because the continuing
decline in stock prices forced them to make additional payments for
stocks bought on margin, Hashizume said.
   ``Investors have become so pessimistic,'' Shuji Mihara of Nomura
Securities said.
   Last week, four major securities firms asked the Finance
Ministry and Tokyo Stock Exchange to take measures to support the
market. But many traders and analysts believe technical adjustments
can have only limited effect on the market.
   They believe only montary action by the central bank to lower
interest rates could help boost prices immediately.
   Hashizume said the Bank of Japan today bought Japanese
government bonds, including the benchmark No. 119 10-year bonds, in
an attempt to stabilize their prices and lower yields.

   The dollar sank in European trading this morning
as investors turned to gold and to British and Swiss currencies as
safe havens.
   Gold prices retreated from overnight peaks as dealers reported
some drop in demand.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 145.88 yen, down 1.04 from
Wednesday's finish. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at
145.70 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.5418 West German marks, down from 1.5535
   _1.2550 Swiss francs, down from 1.2735
   _5.1900 French francs, down from 5.2260
   _1.7485 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7500
   _1,151.50 Italian lire, down from 1,159.00
   _1.1325 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1363
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound, and was
quoted at $1.9555, compared with $1.9275 late Wednesday.
   The pound, strengthened by rising prices for Britain's North Sea
oil, also gained against the West German mark, which is under
pressure because of the expected costs of unifying Germany.
   Paul Chertkow, chief currency strategist at Citibank, said the
pound was likely to break through its 1988 high of 3.2850 marks.
   Gold prices had risen to $416.70 in Far East trading but fell
back in London.
   However, Ted Arnold, a metals specialist at Merrill Lynch Pierce
Fenner &amp; Smith Ltd., said trading had slowed to a moderate level
but demand, especially from the Middle East, remained strong.
   Dealers said there was no sign of increased Japanese interest in
gold following the recent sharp declines in stock values.
   Arnold noted that a similar collapse in Taipei stock prices has
brought a rush of Taiwanese gold buying.
   In Europe, he said, some investment funds are also reported to
have switched to gold as a safe haven during the crisis in the
Middle East.
   London's major gold dealers fixed a recommended price of $415.70
this morning, from $410.25 late Wednesday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $415.50, from $410.25 late
Wednesday.
   Gold in Hong Kong rose $4.87 an ounce today, to close at $413.56.
   Silver traded in London at a bid price of $5.22 a troy ounce, up
from Wednesday's $5.15.

<HEAD>Football Star Stops Payments on House He Bought for His Parents</HEAD>

Wallace. A version also moving on sports wires.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   When Steve Wallace signed with the San
Francisco 49ers in 1986, he bought his parents a $179,000 home in a
picturesque Atlanta suburb.
   The football player's salary has quintupled to $465,000 this
season, but he's pulling tight on the purse strings.
   He's stopping the $1,426-a-month mortgage payment.
   ``Mother, father: Here is the notice from the (mortgage
company),'' he said in a notarized letter to his parents in May.
``The house will soon foreclose. Sorry. Take care. Steve Wallace.''
   Once Napoleon and Marion Wallace got over the shock, they filed
a lawsuit July 3 in an effort to keep the payments coming. Wallace
countersued, alleging his parents had harassed him and caused him
unnecessary expense.
   ``The countersuit was a tactic to make them know that I'm
serious,'' Wallace said.
   His parents, without much elaboration, traced the feud to their
son getting married in 1987. Wallace's wife, Vassar, didn't like
the house and wouldn't enter it after they married, the San
Francisco Chronicle reported Wednesday.
   ``We've been hurt pretty bad,'' Wallace's mother told the
newspaper. ``They will mess up our credit we worked for all our
lives. I'm getting older, and his father is getting older, and we
just can't let them foreclose on our house and let them mess up our
lives.''
   She said her son insisted on buying his parents the house in
Stone Mountain, Ga.
   Five months later, their son got married and moved from Georgia
to San Francisco, where real estate prices are far higher. He
bought a 1,600-square-foot condominium, less than half the size of
his parents' dream home.
   ``I didn't feel good about it,'' Wallace said. ``I felt I was
working more for my parents than for myself.''
   Napoleon Wallace is a 25-year employee of General Motors. His
wife said she has stopped working because of her health. They said
their son knew they could not afford the house or pay the mortgage.
   ``If they foreclose, my clients will be out on the street,''
said their attorney, Gary Harris.
   Wallace conceded the mortgage payments could fit into his budget.
   ``I don't think it will kill me ... because I love my parents
and I want to make the time we have on this earth enjoyable,''
Wallace said.
   But he added, ``The only thing I want is to let me live my life
and stop hanging on. Don't treat me like I'm some type of gold mine
that you dip into every now and then.''

<HEAD>State Department Advises Fleeing Americans to Plan Route Carefully</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts grafs 4-6, ABC News, with ABC report, Cheney quote.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The State Department is advising Americans in
Kuwait to ``plan their route carefully'' if they try to flee the
country overland despite orders to Iraqi forces to arrest anyone
identified as a U.S. citizen.
   Previously, the department had advised Americans not to try to
leave Kuwait without permission. About 500 Americans ignored the
advice and got out. The change in the advice was made over the
weekend and came to light in a statement released by the department
Wednesday.
   The statement, beamed into the Persian Gulf over the Voice of
America as such statements are daily, announced the
administration's decision to keep the U.S. embassy in Kuwait open,
but with a reduced staff. Iraq had demanded that foreign embassies
be closed by Friday.
   ABC News, citing Iraqi sources in Baghdad, said troops will
surround each open diplomatic mission in Kuwait when the deadline
expires. The unidentified sources said the troops may prevent food
from going into the buildings, which will be ``put under virtual
siege.''
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said on ABC's ``Good Morning
America'' that ``I don't have any way of knowing what they will do.
The president's made it very clear, as have many of the other world
leaders, that we would deem this an illegal act, that we have
legitimate representation with the government of Kuwait.''
   ``We don't recognize the Iraqi annexation of Kuwait and I think
most of us are determined to keep our embassies open. ...I think it
would be a mistake for Saddam Hussein to try to close down all
those embassies in Kuwait. But he's done foolish things before,''
Cheney said.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher, asked why the advice
to Americans in Kuwait was changed, said, ``The situation for
Americans has changed.''
   The broadcast announcement continued to caution Americans, as it
has before, that ``there can be no guarantee for the safety'' of
those attempting to cross the border. It noted that Iraqi forces
were under orders to stop people identified as American citizens.
   Boucher said the department had been in touch with 1,984
Americans in Kuwait since Iraq invaded the country Aug. 2. He said
the best estimate of the total is still about 2,500, with another
530 or so in Iraq.
   President Bush described them Monday as hostages and has
insisted _ unsuccessfully so far _ that they be permitted to get
out.
   Iraq had called for all foreign embassies in Kuwait to shift
their operations to Baghdad, the Iraqi capital, as of Friday.
   Bush, asked at a news conference in Kennebunkport, Maine,
Wednesday what would happen when the Iraqi deadline is reached,
said, ``We'll wait and see.''
   There are about 60 American diplomats and about 60 dependents,
including nearly 30 children, in Kuwait City. Boucher said they
would leave by road for Baghdad ``in the next day or two.''
   Boucher said Iraqi authorities had assured the United States the
diplomats and their families will be allowed to leave the country.
   The department said the rest of the embassy staff would remain
``for the express purpose of serving American citizens detained in
Kuwait.''
   Boucher said the reason the diplomats could be spared was that
their jobs involved dealing with the overthrown Kuwaiti government,
a function that no longer exists.
   Another eight Americans who worked for United Nations agencies
in Kuwait , along with their families, may have reached Jordan
Tuesday night, he said.
   Mohamed Sadiq al-Mashat, the Iraqi ambassador to Washington, was
called to the State Department on Wednesday to receive a special
appeal for the release of 12 Americans with what Boucher described
as ``urgent medical problems.''
   He gave a noncommittal reply and was expected to convey the
request to Baghdad, a U.S. official said afterward.

<TEXT>
   The mayor and governor signed an agreement to
provide housing and other services to 5,200 mentally ill homeless
people by June 1992, but the plan must overcome major obstacles
before it can be implemented.
   Tight finances and likely neighborhood opposition to the housing
could hinder the plan.
   ``This agreement creates a system to replace a revolving door,''
said Gov. Mario Cuomo on Wednesday. ``We believe that with a home
and some help, men and women can rebuild their lives.''
   Under the plan, new housing, enhanced with social services, will
be developed for 3,300 people. Other kinds of housing will be found
for another 1,900 people.
   ``Learning from the mistakes of the past, we must begin to
create housing and service programs that conform to the special
needs of these people,'' said Mayor David Dinkins.
   Emmanuel Lemakis, president of Friends and Advocates of the
Mentally Ill, issued a statement saying the plan does not go far
enough. ``The additional units announced today will barely make a
dent,'' he said.
   Peter P. Smith, president of the Partnership for the Homeless,
was more optimistic. ``We've seen similar, ambitious plans
announced before ... with precious few results,'' Smith said. ``All
the indications are that this new plan is different.''
   The agreement brought a formal end to years of infighting
between the city and the state over responsibility for the
thousands of mentally ill people who are shuttled between
psychiatric hospitals, shelters and the streets.
   Dr. Billy E. Jones, the city's commissioner of mental health,
mental retardation and alcoholism services, said the siting issue
is ``the biggest concern.''
   ``Everybody is going to say, `Yes, but not in my neighborhood,''
Jones said.
   Money may also be a concern: The $27 million in state funds that
the program will require this year was approved by the Legislature
in the spring, but only with difficulty, with the
Republican-controlled Senate proposing to eliminate at least $7
million from the package.
   Mental health officials say they will need about $30 million in
each of the next two fiscal years to finish construction and start
the program, which will cost about $50 million a year to operate
once it is in place.

<HEAD>Commercial Traffic Continues After Jordan Closes Border With Iraq</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Refugees continued to pour into Jordan
today despite a government order to close the border to foreigners
fleeing Iraq and Kuwait. Two-way commercial traffic also flowed, in
defiance of U.N. sanctions.
   Meanwhile, King Hussein flew to Yemen today on the first stop of
a round of regional visits aimed at settling the Persian Gulf
crisis, which began with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. That
prompted the U.S.-led military buildup in Saudi Arabia and United
Nations sanctions against Iraq.
   The Jordanian frontier was to have closed to foreigners at
midnight, but a senior security official said 11,000 refugees,
mostly Egyptians, passed through the Ruweishid border post early
today. The post, 240 miles northeast of Amman, is the only crossing
point from Iraq.
   The security official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
another 20,000 people, mostly Arabs or Asians, were waiting on the
Iraqi side at Rutbah, 75 miles east of Ruweishid, and said Jordan
would allow them in too.
   The security official said the refugees were being given a few
hours' grace, and indicated the border would be closed to them
later. He did not specifically say when.
   ``We will be breaking the Interior Ministry rules just this one
time and we will allow the crowd to cross into Jordan today,'' the
officer said.
   He said Jordan had notified Iraqi authorities of the closing of
the frontier to refugees, and Iraq had stopped granting exit
permits.
   The closing of the border to refugees came after King Hussein
complained at a news conference Wednesday that Jordan simply could
not cope with the human flood. On Wednesday, 42,000 evacuees,
mostly Arabs and Asians, arrived in Jordan, in the biggest one-day
border crossing since the crisis erupted.
   Meanwhile, commercial and oil trucks could be seen today,
crossing in either direction between Jordan and Iraq at a rate of
one every five minutes.
   That indicated Jordan has still not implemented the U.N.
sanctions imposed against Iraq.
   A senior official at the border post said the border closing
``does not apply to trade between the two countries, it only
applies to people coming in.'' The official spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Jordan has been under increasing pressure from its Arab and
Western allies, especially the United States, to abide by
international sanctions imposed against Iraq to force it to
relinquish Kuwait.
   In a visit to President Bush's vacation home in Maine last week,
King Hussein refused to promise he would close Jordan's Red Sea
port of Aqaba to Iraq-bound cargo to comply with the U.N. sanctions.
   The U.N. Security Council and Japanese government have agreed to
help Jordan cope with a loss of trade as a result of the U.N.
embargo on Iraq.
   Jordan says the embargo against Iraq will add to the kingdom's
economic woes because it depends heavily on trade with its neighbor.
   Iraq has been supplying 90 percent of Jordan's oil needs, but on
Wednesday, Saudi Oil Minister Thabet Al Taher said Saudi Arabia
would begin supplying Jordan with 33,000 barrels per day via a
defunct pipeline. Taher said it was not yet clear whether Jordan
would continue receiving oil from Iraq.
   Interior Minister Salem Msadeh indicated Wednesday that the
closure of the border to foreigners would only be temporary. But he
did not speculate on how long it would last. Msadeh said the border
was being shut because of ``concern for the health situation of the
arrivals and to ensure suitable arrangements for their stay in
Jordan.''
   At his news conference on Wednesday, King Hussein said 185,000
people have arrived in Jordan recently. Only 67,000 have gone on to
other destinations.
   ``We are encountering enormous difficulties in meeting the needs
of these people,'' he said. The refugees jam air terminals, the

   It was not immediately clear if Jordan also planned to stop
Iraqi Airways flights, ferrying daily between 300 and 400 people
from Baghdad.

   Kuwaitis who fled their nation are
forming a liberation army to lead any military effort to force out
Iraqi occupation forces, Kuwait's crown prince said today.
   ``We will be reorganizing, rearming, re-equipping with necessary
arms to take part as an advance team in liberating our country,''
Prince Saad Abdullah al Sabah said. ``We Kuwaitis will never submit
or surrender to threats or to aggression or to occupation.''
   Prince Abdullah, the No. 2 official in the ousted Kuwaiti
government, met with reporters at a hotel where he and other
Kuwaiti officials have set up temporary headquarters at this
mountain resort.
   Abdullah declared that ``the Kuwaiti government is alive and
well'' and implored world leaders to tighten the economic and
political sanctions against Iraq.
   ``We in Kuwait and our brothers in this vital part of the world,
are fully convinced that it is quite necessary that we should
cooperate together and to fight and to struggle, by all means
available to us to free Kuwait,'' he said.
   Abdullah said he was convinced Iraq was planning to launch an
attack on Saudi Arabia next in an effort to gain control of its oil
and other riches.
   ``The unjustified and unlawful aggression has shown to all the
world the real designs and the real expansionist ambitions of the
Iraqi regime,'' he said.
   Abdullah, flanked by other Kuwaiti officials, said some Kuwaitis
who fled have returned to their country to take part in a
resistance movement. Others, he said, were preparing to take up
arms in case a military assault is made to force the Iraqis out.
   ``We will fight and fight and fight until we drive out the
aggressors from our country,'' he said. ``We will do everything. We
are willing to sacrifice everything, not only our money and our
funds but also our blood to liberate our country.''
   The resistance movement, he said, ``is growing day by day. It
has been escalating and will continue to escalate.''
   Abdullah said two or three members of the al Sabah royal family
had been arrested in Kuwait. Other Kuwaiti officials said the emir
was in the hotel but would not meet with reporters.
   ``He is too formal,'' said Ali Jaber al Sabah, a member of the
royal family who serves as marketing director for the
government-owned Kuwait Petroleum Co.
   Jaber said the company is making arrangements to purchase about
250,000 barrels of Saudi crude on a daily basis so that it can
supply its gas stations in Europe. He said he also was negotiating
with other Persian Gulf oil producers. The oil operation is being
run out of London.
   Jaber said Kuwaitis still in their country have reported that
two palaces are being used as ``concentration camps'' for women and
children arrested at demonstrations.
   ``They are beating the hell out of them,'' he said.
   Jaber said recent reports indicate food is getting scarce in
Kuwait but that looting was not as common as in the days
immediately following the Aug. 2 invasion.
   ``Unarmed boys are walking the neighborhoods to deter looting,''
Jabr said.

<HEAD>Israelis Gearing Up For Possible Chemical Attack</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top Civil Defense officer went on national
radio today to urge Israelis to stock food, tape shut windows and
mix a homemade antidote to defend against a possible Iraqi chemical
attack.
   The announcement on state-owned army radio was the government's
first public response to Israeli fears that their country could be
a major target if the Persian Gulf crisis leads to war.
   Despite repeated threats by President Saddam Hussein of Iraq
that he would answer an American military strike with a chemical
attack on Israel, government leaders have put off a decision on
nationwide distribution of gas masks.
   Today's newspapers published advice on how to wear gas masks and
defend against a chemical attack. Stores reported Israelis were
rushing to buy tape to seal windows and baking soda, which can be
used in homemade gas masks.
   ``This is not a threat against our existence, but we need to
protect ourselves,'' Col. Dov Peled, head of the Civil Defense
division for protective gear, said in the radio broadcast.
   Outlining the precautions, he said: ``We advise that there be
enough food for the family for a week or two, that there be a first
aid kit, insulating tape for sealing windows.''
   ``The most important thing is to listen to the radio, and
therefore you need a transistor radio with extra batteries. And it
is important to explain to the kids what to do,'' he continued.
   Peled also told his listeners that even without gas masks, they
could protect themselves against a chemical attack.
   ``You can cover your face with a handkerchief or towel soaked in
baking soda mixed with a liter of water. This solution increases
protection. You also need to cover the exposed parts of your body.
Only use natural fibers,'' Peled advised.
   The government decision Wednesday not to hand out gas masks
apparently was made because of fears their distribution could cause
panic or be misinterpreted by the Iraqis as a signal that Israel is
preparing a preemptive strike.
   But many Israelis already have begun to buy gas masks rather
than wait for free ones from the government.
   Ezra Tzur, a private importer, sold out his stock of 1,000 masks
within hours Wednesday after placing a small ad in a newspaper, the
Yediot Ahronot daily wrote. The masks sold for the equivalent of
$149 apiece.
   Israeli worries about an attack were also evident in shopping
patterns.
   At the Supersol supermarket in downtown Jerusalem, baking soda
was sold out today and the next shipment was due Friday.
   ``We are selling four or five times more baking soda than
usual,'' said manager Rifka Yizhak. She said there was no run on
canned goods.
   At Houminer's hardware store in Jerusalem, manager Avraham Yosha
reported a 40 percent increase in the sale of insulating tape,
emergency lights, jerry cans for water, as well as portable toilets
and wash basins that can be used in shelters and sealed rooms.
   Today's Maariv daily carried two pages on how to seal a room,
use a gas mask and inject oneself with medication against nerve gas.
   But some Israelis, hardened by five wars, exhibited bravado or
indifference in the face of Iraqi threats.
   ``I'm not worried about an Iraqi attack. I haven't bought any
baking soda, and I'm not stocking food,'' said Yael, a 35-year-old
Jerusalem housewife who was shopping at the Supersol.
   Another shopper, 74-year-old Bunny Sachs, who came to Israel 11
years ago from Johannesburg, said: ``I've seen so much in my life
that I'm not going to get upset over this.''

   Pentagon officials say Rutgers University is
the first school to cut scholarships to ROTC students because of
the armed services' prohibition against homosexuals serving in the
military.
   Rutgers said Tuesday that it will stop handing out four merit
scholarships each year to ROTC students. Critics of the move said
it had the wrong target, because it could deny room and board to
needy students.
   ``The military's policy is as outmoded as their former policy on
women and blacks was,'' said David Burns, a Rutgers vice president.
``Our intent was not to deny the program to a certain group of
students, but to open it to all.''
   Maj. Doug Hart, a Defense Department spokesman, said Rutgers was
the first school he knew of that protested the policy by cutting
scholarships to ROTC students. Other schools have taken measures
that range from polite lobbying to kicking ROTC off campus.
   Rutgers' policy forbids discriminating against people because of
their sexual orientation. That clashes with a Defense Department
rule that ``homosexuality is incompatible with military service.''
   About 1,400 men and women are discharged from the services each
year for violating the rule, Pentagon officials said. In February,
the Supreme Court upheld the Pentagon policy by declining to hear
two cases opposing the law.
   An official at the American Council on Education, which
represents 1,600 colleges and universities, agreed with Rutgers'
ends but criticized the means as ``harsh on students.''
   ``What are they doing _ penalizing students for upholding the
policies of the United States which have been upheld in every court
case?'' said Sheldon Steinbach, general counsel for the ACE.
   Students are being used ``as hostages on a matter of principle
and ethics,'' said Steinbach, who argued for congressional or
presidential action instead.

<TEXT>
   East Germany's chaotic young democracy agreed
today to abolish the nation on Oct. 3 and turn the territory over
to its rich Western neighbor. Lawmakers from both sides will hold
their first joint parliamentary meeting shortly after unification.
   The decision on the unification date, following a lengthy
debate, was priased by leading West German politicians in Bonn.
   Volker Ruehe, general secretary of West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, called the decision ``an
historic event for Germany'' after more than four decades of
division.
   ``The decision most importantly gives the people of the GDR
(East Germany) grounds for confidence,'' Ruehe said.
   West German Finance Minister Theo Waigel called the decision a
``reasonable solution.'' Waigel said the chosen date also takes
into consideration the international political aspects of
unification, and leaves sufficient time for both Germanys to
prepare for the final step of unity.
   Otto Lambsdorff, the head of West Germany's centrist Free
Democrats, the junior coalition partner in Kohl's government, said:
``The decision on the date (of unity) gives the people in the GDR
hope.''
   Kohl was to address a special session of the West German
Parliament later today to give his assessment of the East German
Parliament's decision.
   After an 11-hour debate, lawmakers overcame a damaging political
feud and voted overwhelmingly to unify with West Germany on Oct. 3
_ nearly one breathtaking year after the hard-line Communist
government was toppled.
   The lawmakers also approved an election treaty with West Germany
that will allow Germans in both nations to elect a single
government on Dec. 2 for the first time in nearly 60 years.
   The rare moment of agreement in the East German Parliament has
resulted in a timetable for German unification that is all but
certain.
   Weary lawmakers burst into applause when Parliament President
Sabine Bergmann-Pohl announced the ``truly historic event'' at 2:50
a.m. They voted 294-62 to set Oct. 3 as the date the nation becomes
part of a single Germany. Seven abstained.
   The date falls just four days before East Germany would have
celebrated its 42nd anniversary. Following last year's anniversary,
massive strikes and demonstrations toppled Communist Party chief
Erich Honecker, leading to the opening of the Berlin Wall, the
country's first democratic elections and first non-Communist
government.
   The Oct. 3 unification date was a compromise between the major
factions in Parliament after a weeks of battling that tore apart
the broad coalition government of Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere.
   East Germany in effect has approved a clause in the West German
Constitution that allows former German lands to accede to the
Western nation. The agreement is a major psychological boost to a
troubled nation crushed by economic and political chaos during its
crash program to shift from communism to capitalism.
   De Maiziere urged the lawmakers to accept Oct. 3 as the day of
German unity and end the seemingly pointless squabbling over
whether unity should take place in August, September or October.
   ``Many people have gotten the impression discussions over a date
are more important to us than the solution of crucial problems,''
de Maiziere told Parliament.
   ``A binding commitment and an end to the discussion are long
overdue,'' he said.
   The weeks-long dispute was the result of a power struggle
between the Christian Democrats of de Maiziere and Kohl and the
left-leaning Social Democrats in both nations.
   The two parties are jockeying furiously for the best political
advantage heading into Dec. 2 elections.
   Many lawmakers acknowledged the convoluted wrangling that in
recent days has seemed to have lost relevance as average East
Germans struggle with rising joblessness and higher prices.
   ``I ask you, who even understands our desires?'' asked Gregor
Gysi, head of the reformed Communists, the third-largest party in
Parliament.
   The Social Democrats had said unity should take place no later
than Sept. 15 so West Germany can deal directly with East Germany's
serious economic problems.
   But the Social Democrats also were pressing for the early unity
so Kohl would be blamed at the polls for the high costs of bailing
out East Germany's woeful economy.
   De Maiziere had been pressing for Oct. 14, the date East Germans
will elect governments for the five states the nation will become
in a united Germany.
   Unemployment has been climbing since East Germany converted to a
free market on July 1. Factories have been unable to compete with
an invasion of Western products.
   West Germany says it is crucial that unity not occur before the
Oct. 1-2 meeting in New York of foreign ministers from the
35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
   The meeting will cap a series of negotiations between the two
Germanys and the four World War II Allies _ the United States, the
Soviet Union, Britain and France _ which together have hundreds of
thousands of troops stationed on German soil.
   In those negotiations, the Soviet Union dropped its opposition
to NATO membership for a united Germany in exchange for a promise
its troops in what is now East Germany can remain there for up to
four years. Also reached was an agreement that a united Germany
would not try to claim lands forfeited to Poland after Nazi
Germany's defeat in 1945.

   ``Paradise Central'' is the
nickname regulars have given the Dhahran International Hotel, a
modern, three-story, 200-bed facility that has become headquarters
for a growing band of foreigners in Saudi Arabia.
   The hotel is home to scores of Kuwaiti refugees, dozens of
foreign reporters, U.S. Air Force pilots, and press officers from
the American military and Saudi government.
   The Palm Court _ a sunken lounge with blue easy chairs and live
goldfish swimming in a rock pond _ teems with Arab men in their
floor-length white caftans and red-and-white checkered headdresses.
   They never socialize with the women, whose faces are covered
with black veils, sometimes with slits at their eyes.
   All day and late into the night, young Kuwaiti children,
sometimes holding baby sisters and brothers, giggle and play in the
hallways. They tumble down the stairways and push elevator buttons
as their dispossessed parents ponder the future.
   ``These kids; they're something,'' said Navy Lt. Cmdr. Greg
Hartung, one of the Pentagon spokesmen from Washington assigned to
help reporters cover the story.
   The central meeting place is the 24-hour Sand Coffee Shop which
serves a buffet with American and Saudi food for breakfast, lunch
and dinner. Its current patrons include the likes of NBC-TV
anchorman Tom Brokaw and ABC-TV's Sam Donaldson.
   The Dhahran International is much like an American hotel in the
comforts it offers.
   Yet there are differences, reflecting the Saudi culture.
   Men and women are forbidden, for instance, from using the large,
azure-blue swimming pool at the same time. Ladies' hours are from 9
a.m. to 1 p.m.
   There is also no bar because alcohol consumption is against the
law in this traditional Moslem society.
   For the hotel's general manager, Gunther K. Baehr, the Persian
Gulf crisis has been a boon.
   After some lean years in the 1980s, ``We're fully booked,'' he
said.

   Prince Fahd Bin Salman, the vice governor of Saudi Arabia's
eastern province, hosted a sumptuous buffet dinner at his palace
for foreigners visiting the region.
   Guests sat under an air-conditioned tent in a setting out of the
Arabian nights.
   The famed Saudi hospitality had a special meaning for Los
Angeles Times reporter Kim Murphy, who lost a contact lens.
   Upon hearing her plight, the American-educated prince, took
charge. He informed her that a car would fetch her at 8:30 a.m. the
next morning and take her to an eye doctor. Within an hour, Ms.
Murphy was fitted for a new lens.

   Every night at 7, expatriate businessmen at the Al Bustan
Compound gather in the recreation room to shoot pool, watch
television news and mull over their situation.
   The Al Bustan, like a number of other residential compounds for
foreigners, is a heavily guarded complex with townhouses,
apartments and recreation facilities.
   Usually, the place is teeming with children, but now it more
resembles a ghost town. Thousands of wives and children left after
Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.
   ``It's depressing,'' said Doug Watts, who sent his wife and
12-year-old daughter back home to Lubbock, Texas.
   These unfortunate temporary bachelors crowd around the
television set whenever President Bush's face appears on Bahrain
television, explaining the rationale for the military buildup.
   ``We don't know what is going to happen,'' one man said.

side-by-side with American fighters.
   Salman thinks the military buildup has gotten out of hand.

<TEXT>
   A 5-year-old girl who survived while
eight people died in Michigan's deadliest auto crash remained in
critical condition in a Lansing hospital today.
   Officers in rural central lower Michigan were investigating
whether alcohol was the cause.
   Sheriff's Deputy Jill Wicke said the car carrying Cara Cummings
and four others was struck broadside about 9:30 p.m. Tuesday at a
rural intersection when the second car apparently ran a stop sign.
   Victims in the car containing Cara were identified as Lisa Ann
Hayes, 24; Garrett W. Hayes, 28; Garrett W. Hayes Jr., 3; and Laura
Lynn Ostrander, 19. Authorities say they were returning home from a
slow-pitch softball tournament.
   Those killed in the other car were identified as James W.
Somers, 20; Tina Marie Kvalevog, 17; Terry L. Pouch, 25; and
Vanessa Marie Coon, 19. They were two young couples on a double
date, said Laurie Somers Ringle, Somers' aunt.
   Police found a whiskey bottle in the car carrying the four young
adults. Results from blood alcohol tests won't be available for
about two weeks.
   The impact turned both cars into twisted chunks of metal.
   ``We tried to look over as many people as we could,'' Joanne
Fornusek of Elsie Area Ambulance Service said Wednesday. ``We knew
we obviously couldn't help some, so we went on to others.
   ``It's been a tough night and a tough day. I don't think too
many of us slept last night.''

<TEXT>
   Two U.N. envoys checking on foreigner
hostages in Iraq and Kuwait were told their organization is ``a
tool'' of the U.S. government, the Iraqi News Agency said today.
   Iraq's Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, told them the world should
pressure the United States to withdraw its forces from the Persian
Gulf region because Saddam Hussein had tied the fate of the
foreigners to U.S. actions.
   Hours later, Iraq's health minister appealed to three
U.N.-affiliated organizations to pressure the United States and
other countries to drop the economic embargo imposed on Iraq after
it invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The minister, Salam M. Sa'eed, sent letters to the World Health
Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization and UNICEF
saying the embargo contradicted international law and threatened
all Iraqis with starvation, especially children and the elderly,
said INA.
   The economic sanctions would lead to the spread of disease,
effecting not just Iraq, but the whole world, Sa'eed said.
   The U.N. officials, Virendra Dayal and Kofi Annan, met Aziz in
Baghdad on Wednesday to discuss the future of an estimated 2
million foreigners in the two countries. Baghdad says Western
hostages are being placed around military installations to prevent
an attack by Western forces in the Persian Gulf.
   Still, Aziz assured the two envoys the foreigners were being
well treated. ``They are the guests of the Iraqi people,'' INA
quoted him as saying.
   ``Their situation is linked with the intentions of the U.S.
administration. The international community must put pressure on
the U.S. administration to stop the policy of war and aggression,
withdraw its forces from the region and leave regional affairs
alone to be tackled within the Arab context,'' he said.
   INA, monitored in Cyprus, quoted Aziz as telling the two that
the U.N. Security Council had become ``an American tool.'' He said,
``This marks the beginning of a dark period in the history of the
United Nations.''
   Aziz said the United Nations should be working for peace on the
basis of Saddam's proposal to free foreigners in exchange for the
withdrawal of the U.S.-led multinational force and the lifting of
the trade sanctions.
   Dayal, who is the top U.N. political officer, and Annan, the
head of personnel, were to wrap up their talks with Iraqi officials
today. U.N. spokeswoman Nadia Younes said they had a ``substantial
and detailed discussion'' with the Iraqi foreign minister.
   They are also seeking to discuss the fate of U.N. employees and
their families in the two countries. Seventy-five have left, but
the United Nations wants to evacuate the remaining 235.
   The United States has led efforts to impose mandatory sanctions
on Iraq to force it to pull its forces out of Kuwait.
   Iraq has already started housing the detainees around key
military and civilian targets, saying they would be a shield to
prevent an American attack.
   While most Asian and Arab workers have been permitted to leave
the country, up to 20,000 Westerners are barred from traveling. The
largest communities include 4,500 Britons and 3,000 Americans.
   Tens of thousands of Arabs and Asians and several hundred
Westerners have escaped into Saudi Arabia or across the border with
Jordan.
   But Jordan said Wednesday it was closing its border until those
already taxing the country's emergency services have left the
country.

<HEAD>Maryland-Based Arab Radio Station Reflects Divisions over Mideast
Crisis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   If President Bush had been listening Aug. 1 to
a southern Maryland radio station, he would have heard that Iraq
invaded Kuwait three hours earlier than he did, the station manager
says.
   However, the news was broadcast in Arabic.
   Atef Abdel Gawad, station manager of WNTL-AM in Waldorf, recalls
the 5:15 p.m. broadcast.
   ``I said, `The reports I am going to tell you now are yet to be
confirmed, but I have it from reliable sources that Iraqi troops
are crossing the Kuwaiti lines right now,' '' Gawad told The
(Baltimore) Sun.
   As the world increasingly turns its attention to the crisis in
the Middle East, the 50,000-watt station has become a leading
source of information for Arab-Americans in the Washington area.
   The station, located about 20 miles south of Washington, is the
only radio station in the country that broadcasts in Arabic seven
days a week. Its audience includes the 22 Arab embassies in
Washington and many of the 38,000 Arab-Americans in the area.
   Normally, the station's format includes Arabic music, soap
operas, religious services, live British Broadcasting Corp.
newscasts from London and a call-in show. That changed Aug. 1.
These days nearly all programming deals with the situation in the
Persian Gulf.
   ``There is nothing to talk about but the crisis right now,''
said Cairo-born Gawad, a former Voice of America reporter.
   The station, which used to get 70 calls a day, is fielding twice
as many, said Mohammed Al Bedrawl, the Saudi-born founder and
chairman of the Arab Network of America.
   The callers illustrate the sharp division among Arab-Americans,
with some deploring Iraq's actions and others lambasting Kuwait,
Saudi Arabia and the United States.

   In an apparent effort to influence Japan's response
to the Persian Gulf crisis, Iraq has moved Japanese nationals from
Kuwait to Baghdad and refused to allow them to depart for Jordan,
Japan said today.
   The move by Iraq came one day after an official in Tokyo said
the Japanese government is committed to giving aid to Arab
countries that support the economic boycott designed to punish Iraq
for invading Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The Iraqi ambassador was summoned to Japan's Foreign Ministry
and told that Baghdad should permit the Japanese to leave.
   The Foreign Ministry said 178 Japanese had moved in three groups
to Baghdad from the Japanese Embassy in Kuwait, where they had
taken refuge soon after the invasion. Another group of 62
reportedly was following.
   Eight of the 178 then traveled to Jordan, the ministry said. The
rest joined about 200 Japanese who are not permitted to leave Iraq.
   Japan has decided in principle to compensate Jordan for losses
if it joins the sanctions against Iraq, a Japanese official said
Wednesday on condition of anonymity. But the timing of the aid and
the amount have not been determined.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu rejected a suggestion by an
opposition leader that Japan directly negotiate with Iraq over the
hostages.
   Kaifu was quoted by Kyodo News Service today as saying the
United Nations is dealing with the thousands of Westerners detained
by the Iraqis, and ``it would be difficult for Japan to move by
itself.''
   Kaifu thus turned aside Baghdad's apparent attempt Wednesday to
divide the Western nations when it said some French and Japanese
citizens could be permitted to leave as a goodwill gesture.
   Only two Japanese diplomats were left as a skeleton staff at the
embassy in Kuwait. Iraq has demanded that all foreign missions in
Kuwait City close by Friday. The United States and other nations
have said they will not comply.
   The Japan government supports the U.N.-mandated economic
sanctions against Iraq, but it is in an extended debate over the
shape of its promised further steps against Iraq. Japan is limited
by a constitution that bans the use of force to settle
international disputes.
   Details of the proposed financial aid package for Arab countries
that have opposed the Iraqi invasion have yet to emerge.
   But it would require billions of dollars to help Jordan, Egypt
and Turkey recoup the loss of oil transit fees and income from
citizens working in Iraq.

   Armenia's Parliament overwhelmingly passed a
declaration of independence today, becoming the fifth of the 15
Soviet republics to move toward separation from the Kremlin.
   The decision increases pressure for the Soviet Union to split
into separate countries, even as President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
struggles to develop a new union treaty attractive enough to keep
his nation whole.
   But Armenia's path to independence may be complicated by its
bloody two-year conflict with the neighboring republic of
Azerbaijan in the southern Soviet Union over the disputed territory
of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   The Armenian ``Declaration of Independence'' was approved by a
vote of 183-2, legislator Samvel Shakhmuradyan said in a telephone
interview from Yerevan, the capital of the small republic bordering
with Turkey and Iran.
   The resolution ``declares the beginning of the process
establishing independent statehood,'' according to an English
translation sent to The Associated Press.
   Shakhmuradyan said he expects the republic to remain part of the
Soviet Union only during a transition period to complete
separation, but he did not specify how long that might take or what
other steps would be taken.
   The declaration says Armenia will have a multiparty political
system and freedom of expression, the press and religion, Tass
reported. The declaration calls for separation of legislative,
executive and judiciary powers.
   The resolution invalidates the Soviet Constitution in Armenia
and will itself become the basis for a new Armenian constitution.
The republic's current constitution will remain until a new one is
written, Shakhmuradyan said.
   The resolution grants citizenship to all residents of the
republic and to any Armenians living outside its borders.
   The resolution also called for creation of armed forces to
safeguard the Armenian border, which is often the scene of violent
conflict with Azerbaijanis. A nationalist opposition force
estimated to have at least 5,000 well-armed fighters has been
operating for some time in the republic, though it was unclear
whether they would make up the new force.
   When Lithuania declared independence in March, Gorbachev
rejected the move and started a 10-week war of nerves that included
intimidating troop movements and an economic blockade on all oil
and most natural gas shipments. In late June, however, Lithuania
agreed to freeze its declaration in return for negotiations on
independence, expected to begin soon.
   The neighboring Baltic republic of Estonia, which followed
Lithuania with a declaration of a transition period toward
independence, was expected to begin its formal negotiations with
the Kremlin today.
   Latvia is also expecting to begin talks in the next week.
Georgia has declared its intention of moving toward independence.
   Five other republics also have declared ``sovereignty'' or the
right to overturn Soviet laws on their territory. They are Russia,
the largest of the 15 republics, the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Moldavia
and Uzbekistan.
   Armenia's new nationalist president, Levon Ter-Petrosyan, said
the resolution was an historic decision allowing Armenia to set its
own ``relations with the world,'' including with neighboring
Azerbaijan and other Soviet republics, according to the independent
news agency Interfax.
   But the declaration is likely to further strain relations with
Azerbaijan because it includes a statement on Armenia's ``inherent
right of reunification with Nagorno-Karabakh,'' a largely Armenian
area in Azerbaijan.
   During the Armenian's three-day debate leading up to passage of
the declaration, the president of Azerbaijan criticized the
republic and called for Soviet sanctions against Armenia.
   The Armenian declaration also changes the republic's name from
the ``Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic'' to the ``Republic of
Armenia.''
   Earlier today, Tass reported that troops drove several hundred
Armenian guerrillas out of the Kazakh border region of Azerbaijan
after three days of battles and attacks on villages.
   Several local residents and troops were killed and wounded and
100 homes were destroyed by the Armenian shelling, the official
Soviet news agency said.
   The southern republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan have been
engaged in a bloody conflict since February 1988 over
Nagorno-Karabakh, a mainly Armenian enclave inside Azerbaijan's
borders.
   In an attempt to end the dispute and other ethnic violence in
his multiracial country, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev last month
ordered all outlawed guerrilla groups to turn in their weapons and
disband.
   The decree was largely ignored and the deadline was extended
into September after Armenia elected a new nationalist leader,
Ter-Petrosyan.
   He pledged that local militia would disarm the paramilitary
groups if the Kremlin held back federal troops.
   Maj. Gen. G. Malyushkin, deputy commandant of Nagorno-Karabakh
and adjoining Azerbaijan border regions, said the Armenian
guerrillas used modern weapons in their attack on the Azerbaijani
border region.
   Tass said they included missile and grenade launchers.
   Malyushkin said inadequate laws prevented his troops from
pursuing the bandits across the border and they escaped into
Armenia, Tass reported.
   Reinforcements from the army and Interior Ministry, KGB agents,
tanks and armored vehicles have been dispatched to the region, and
helicopters are searching overhead for Armenian paramilitary units,
Tass said.

<HEAD>Yemeni Port Authorities Told Not to Unload With Iraqi Tanker</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ADEN, Yemen (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has instructed port
authorities not to unload an Iraqi oil tanker, a port official said
today, an indication that Yemen is honoring the trade embargo
against Iraq.
   The port official, who identified himself only as Capt. Barakat,
said the port was told not to receive or deal with the tanker Ain
Zalah, anchored near the Aden oil terminal.
   The Red Sea country told the U.N. Security Council earlier this
week that it would adhere to the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq
after its invasion and annexation of Kuwait.
   Shipping sources said they did not know when the Ain Zalah
arrived at Aden, but a Western diplomat said he had been told it
was early Wednesday.
   The ship is one of four Iraqi tankers anchored near Aden.
Shipping sources said the empty products carrier Baba Gurgur and
the empty oil crude tankers Al-Fao and Al-Qadissiyah are also
anchored outside the oil terminal.
   The Baba Gurgur was one of two Iraqi tankers that refused to
stop Saturday when U.S. Navy frigates fired warning shots across
their bows. Iraq has said the Baba Gurgur sailed to Aden to pick up
a load of fuel oil.
   Shipping sources said it was shadowed by an unidentified
American warship until it reached Yemeni waters on Wednesday.
   The Al-Fao and Al-Qadissiyah came to Aden after they left their
anchorage in the Red Sea off Saudi Arabia last week when they were
unable to pick up a load of crude oil. A Western diplomat said the
two tankers may have sailed to Yemen to find a safe port or to keep
the pressure on the Yemeni government.
   Government officials have declined to discuss the Iraq tankers
at Aden, and the nation's newspapers, which has generally avoided
criticism of Iraq, have not reported the decision to honor the
embargo.
   Another Western diplomat said over the past two days there has
been a slight shift in pro-Iraqi focus of the Yemeni press toward a
more moderate position. The diplomat, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said there have not been any large pro-Iraqi or
anti-U.S., anti-Saudi demonstrations for two days.
   The country was gripped in the first days of the Persian Gulf
crisis by demonstrations, including rock-throwing assaults on the
American Embassy.
   Oil executives and Western diplomats say Yemen needs the revenue
from its Aden refinery and cannot afford to risk drawing
international sanctions for breaking the U.N. embargo.
   But Yemen can adhere to the sanctions without publicly siding
against Iraq by ignoring the tankers and refusing them permission
to load or unload. Saudi Arabia used a similar ploy to turn away
the empty Iraq crude oil tankers.

   The Persian Gulf crisis reached into homes, offices and
factories as President Bush announced he was calling up the
military reserves, and many reservists said they were ready for the
call.
   ``My bags have been packed for the last two weeks,'' said Kevin
Hermening of Mosinee, Wis., a sergeant in the Marine Reserve who at
20 was the youngest of the 52 Americans held hostage in the U.S.
Embassy in Iran a decade ago.
   Wednesday's call-up takes men and women from their homes and
jobs to serve on active duty for the first time since the Vietnam
War.
   About 40,000 Army, Navy and Air Force reservists are expected to
be activated to bolster the U.S. buildup in the gulf, which was
prompted by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait three weeks ago.
   ``People were so ready for peace, and then this turns around and
happens,'' said Jeffrey Smith, 29, a New York City accountant and
Army reservist since 1982. ``Everybody's shocked. The Cold War was
over and suddenly these brush fire wars flare up.
   ``Right now I'm a little nervous,'' Smith said. ``But I stand
ready to go as everyone else does.''
   ``I just listen to the news reports a little more carefully and
made sure my stuff is all together in one pile in the living room
and not all over the house,'' said reservist Sgt. Debora Probeck of
Deltona Beach, Fla.
   ``Any time you're in the reserves, in the back of your mind you
don't count out the possibility that you will go,'' said 1st Sgt.
David McIntosh, a Palm Bay resident whose reserve company is part
of the Army's 337th Military Intelligence Battalion.
   Joseph Bellavia, 43, a pharmaceuticals salesman from Reading,
Mass., said his eight children are scared and don't want him to go.
But he added, ``If you sign on the dotted line, you have to expect
to pay the piper.''
   Officials did not identify the units that would be activated or
say when they would be called. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
planned to meet with military officials today before deciding how
many reservists to call up.
   The Pentagon said some reservists will be shipped to Saudi
Arabia, while others will take the place of troops dispatched to
the Mideast.
   ``It's like being a volunteer fireman,'' Ray Martyniuk of New
Jersey's Department of Military and Veterans' Affairs, which
oversees the state's National Guard. ``You hope there's never a
fire, but if there is one, you know you're ready to deal with it.''
   ``I'm scared to death,'' said Sue Barry, an Air Force Reserve
nurse on staff at the University of Chicago Hospital. ``If they
need me, it's going to be because somebody's hurt. It's going to be
to pick up the pieces.''
   Similarly, Kathleen Brooks, a physician's assistant at Bassett
Hospital in upstate New York, stands at the ready. She's also chief
operations officer of the 139th Aero-medical Evacuation Flight.
   The Air Force has only one active duty aero-medical evacuation
unit to airlift the wounded from battlefields to hospitals; beyond
that, it must look to the Guard, Brooks said, adding:
   ``It's highly likely I'll go.''
   Brooks said her unit spent a week training at Pope Air Force
Base in North Carolina this summer and members were in high spirits.
   ``A lot of people think of those in the Guard as `weekend
warriors,' but those days are over,'' she said.
   Some employers were taking stock of their personnel to determine
the effect a call-up might have on their work forces. FHP Health
Care of Utah reported that as many as 45 of its employees could be
called to active duty.
   The call-up posed a hard choice for Al Beverly, a Republican
challenger to U.S. Rep. George ``Buddy'' Darden, D-Ga. ``I'm not
going to resign my candidacy,'' said the 36-year-old Army reserve
captain from Marietta, Ga. ``I have to figure where to draw the
line between being a captain and being a candidate.''
   Others were concerned about jobs and paying bills.
   ``I would prefer not to be called up, but I'm ready if I'm
needed,'' said dentist Jonathan Waldron, 46, a reservist for 20
years who has a 1,300-patient practice. ``The concern I have is not
for my well-being, but I've got four employees counting on a
paycheck.''
   Angela Adinolfi, 22, a reservist who works at Hanscom Air Force
Base, Mass., said she'd volunteer for active duty despite
objections at home. ``My dad just called me up and told me not to
volunteer to go anywhere,'' she said. ``If I can, I will. I think
it's the right thing to do.''

   The Zodiac Gunman was a no-show again.
   Police ended their fourth dragnet of the summer today without
catching the shooter who has killed one man and injured three
others since March 8 and has promised to strike again.
   ``Operation Watchdog was called off at 8 a.m.,'' said police
spokesman Hugh Barry. ``No Zodiac. Nothing.''
   The Zodiac task force went out Wednesday night anticipating a
possible pre-dawn attack by the astrology-obsessed gunman, who
apparently has not shot anyone since June 21.
   This morning was considered key because it was 63 days from the
gunman's last attack. The four shootings attributed to Zodiac
between March 8 and June 21 have been on Thursdays at intervals of
21 or 63 days.
   Also of possible significance: the astrological sign of Virgo
began today. The gunman has vowed in rambling letters to police and
the news media to shoot one person for each of the 12 signs of the
Zodiac. So far, his victims have been a Scorpio, a Taurus, a Gemini
and a Cancer.
   All of the victims were men. Police believe the gunman had
somehow learned his victims' birthdates.
   About 50 detectives are assigned to the Police Department's
Zodiac task force, and an unspecified number of officers worked
overtime to help them today.
   During previous dragnets for Zodiac, police posed as homeless or
disabled people to resemble the gunman's first four victims.
   Each of the three previous dragnets cost the city $25,000 in
overtime.
   Detectives on the task force have tracked nearly 2,000 leads and
eliminated about a dozen suspects since the case began.
   Investigators, frustrated by the Zodiac's lack of activity, even
have matched fingerprints from the city morgue against two partial
prints found on the gunman's letters in an effort to determine
whether the gunman died.
   ``I can almost say with certainty that if he died, his body
wasn't sent to the morgue,'' said Chief of Detectives Joseph
Borrelli.
   Some detectives have speculated that the gunman has not struck
because he is in jail on an unrelated charge or has been
hospitalized.
   Borrelli said if the gunman were not caught today, the task
force would probably be reduced to free up detectives to deal with
the city's rising crime rate.
   Since the June 21 attack, the gunman has not written any letters
to police or the news media. Calls to the Police Department's
24-hour hotline have trickled down to two or three a day, Borrelli
said.

   Greta Garbo's nephew is challenging her will,
which left nearly all of her multimillion-dollar estate to a niece,
alleging alcoholism muddied Garbo's mind when she wrote the
document.
   Sven Ake Fredriksson, 64, a retired seaman who lives in
Oxelosund, Sweden, and is the illegitimate son of Garbo's brother
Sven Alfred Gustafson, challenged Garbo's will in an attempt to get
part of his aunt's $50 million to $100 million estate.
   Garbo, who died at age 84 on April 15, left virtually everything
to her niece, Gray Gustafson Reisfield of Milltown, N.J.
   Fredriksson's lawyer, A. Joseph Waterman, said in an affidavit
that Garbo was so damaged by failed kidneys, clogged arteries and
alcohol abuse that she did not have a sound mind or body when she
wrote her will in March 1984.
   Waterman cited a published report that Garbo went through at
least one bottle of vodka and two bottles of scotch a week.
   Theodore Kurz, lawyer for the Garbo estate, reserved comment
until he saw Fredriksson's petition and other court papers.
   Manhattan Surrogate Court Judge Marie Lambert set Sept. 4 for a
hearing on Fredriksson's request, made public Wednesday, to break
the will.

   Hey, hey they're the monkeys! And the sneaky stray
simians are driving people bananas.
   Trappers have spotted wild monkey colonies for years in the
area, but a recent spate of trouble calls comes from a new crop of
monkeys escaping from unlicensed owners, said exotic-wildlife
trapper Todd Hardwick.
   ``Boy, we got monkeys coming out of our ears down here,''
Hardwick said Wednesday. ``Since January, I've handled probably 35
or 40 monkey calls just in Dade County.''
   The state issues monkey pet permits only to people who can prove
they have three years experience with simians, he said.
   Hardwick has caught a dozen stray monkeys in the Miami area this
year.
   ``I've apprehended capuchin monkeys, squirrel monkeys, spider
monkeys, macaque monkeys, marmoset monkeys and two green monkeys,''
he said, running out of breath. ``Monkeys, monkeys everywhere. I
don't know what's going on.''
   Neither does the state Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission.
   ``There's been a very marked increase,'' said commission Lt.
Kathleen Kelley. ``Catching them is one of our priorities.''
   But Hardwick said that can be difficult. One recent call took
him to a seventh-floor condominium.
   ``When I stepped on the balcony, he smacked me right on the
mouth,'' the private animal catcher said. ``The bottom line is I've
faced snakes 250 to 300 pounds. I'd rather do that than tangle with
a monkey.''
   The monkeys in Hardwick's experience, ranging in size from 4 to
40 pounds, are smart and can get violent if cornered.
   Many of the loose capuchins, a favorite of organ grinders, have
their long canine teeth intact and will bite to get away. Kelley
underwent a painful series of rabies shots after being bitten
earlier this year.
   ``Everybody else, they look at a monkey and say, `Oh, a cute
monkey,''' he said. ``I've had them throw my own traps down at me.
They'll pick avocados and mangoes and oranges and throw them at
me.''
   Hardwick said the subtropical climate is ideal for monkeys to
survive in the wild, and many people feed the monkeys because they
see them as cuddly creatures.

   Smokers angry over a cigarette shortage blocked a
street next to Red Square, pushing their summer-long nicotine
protest to the heart of Soviet power.
   The scores of protesters ended their blockade after several
hours Wednesday, but only after a truck delivered a dozen cases of
cigarettes to a nearby tobacco kiosk. A line of more than 230
people formed immediately.
   ``It's only a temporary success,'' said protester Sergei
Borinov, watching the truck driver unload the cigarettes. ``They
bring something, sell it in 10 minutes, and again there is nothing.
This is the way we live.''
   Protesters staged another brief blockade of a Moscow street
today, stopping traffic near the Bolshoi Theater. A nearby tobacco
kiosk later opened and sold cigarettes to dozens of people waiting
in a pouring rain.
   Long lines snaked from other tobacco kiosks, although many of
them displayed signs saying ``Cigarettes Nyet.''
   Deputy Mayor Sergei B. Stankevich said 22 of 24 cigarette
factories have closed for repairs in the Russian republic.
   The government newspaper Izvestia said the Soviet Union _ a
nation of 70 million smokers _ bought 5 billion fewer cigarettes
from Bulgaria, a principal supplier, this year because of a lack of
hard currency.
   Cigarettes usually cost about about 80 cents a pack but black
market prices have ranged from $3.20 to $4.80. Kosmos, a premium
brand, has cost up to $8.
   Severe shortages of even basic consumer goods have plagued the
Soviet economy despite limited market-oriented reform pushed by
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Smokers have staged strikes and other demonstrations over the
acute cigarette shortage that has lasted all summer.
   On Monday, 200 people blocked traffic in Leningrad, 300 staged a
similar protest in Gorky, and 3,000 people rallied at a plant in
Yaroslavl, the Interfax news service reported.
   In Wednesday's protest, held during a steady rain, about 120
soggy demonstrators formed a human chain across the wide street
from the Moscow Hotel to the Lenin Central Museum, stopping six
buses and turning back cars.
   Some passengers patiently waited aboard three of the buses, and
the driver of one of them opened his window, winked playfully at
the protesters and said: ``Give me a cigarette!''
   But the atmosphere was tense. At one point, 20 testy
demonstrators surrounded Deputy Mayor Stankevich, a radical
politician elected to the Moscow city council along with other
reformers this year.
   They peppered him with questions on when the cigarette shortage
would end.
   ``This has never happened before!'' a woman shouted at
Stankevich.
   ``Why was there a good supply of everything in Brezhnev's
time?'' a man yelled, referring to the more stable economy under
former leader Leonid I. Brezhnev.
   When one man suggested the Soviet Union use some of its gold
reserves, Stankevich snapped back: ``Gold reserves have nothing to
do with this!''
   ``You see, there is a choice for us _ either we spend money on
medicine or on cigarettes,'' he said. ``Now we have had to take the
money for medicine and buy cigarettes.
   ``Tomorrow, invalids will appear in the streets because they
will not be able to buy important medicine they need. Then we will
have to stop buying cigarettes and start buying medicine again,''
Stankevich said.
   He said he had met with Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov and they
decided to raid army storehouses of shag _ a coarse tobacco _ and
deliver it to key points in Moscow.
   ``As to cigarettes, the situation will improve. Several planes
are arriving in Moscow. They are already landing at the airport,''
he pledged.
   Stankevich said there were no plans to ration cigarettes, saying
it would be too difficult to print and distribute ration coupons.
Informally, however, rationing already exists. Moscow kiosks limit
customers to two packs _ out-of-towners to one.
   After enduring questions for more than 20 minutes, Stankevich,
who told his questioners he is a non-smoker, became sarcastic when
someone suggested starting a rebellion.
   ``Yes, this is the only thing we know how to do,'' he said, his
voice heavy with irony. ``Let's make a revolution. This is what
we're accustomed to. At least we'll have a good time.''
   One woman, her wet hair streaked down her face, sneered at
Stankevich: ``Why are you insulting the people?''
   Stankevich retorted: ``Don't speak on behalf of the whole
people!''

<HEAD>Returning Poles Say Americans Being Guarded In Iraqi Factories</HEAD>
<HEAD>CHANGES SLUG TO AVOID DUPLICATION WITH WASHINGTON-DATED STORY</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>

   Polish workers returning home from Iraq
said they saw Americans arriving at a chemical factory under guard,
a newspaper said today.
   That appeared to bear out Iraq's assertion that foreign
nationals would be used as human shields to prevent an attack on
key installations.
   The Polish workers' account was among the first eyewitness
reports on what was happening to Americans in Iraq once they were
rounded up by Iraq.
   The United States and other countries have repeatedly demanded
that their citizens be allowed to leave Iraq and Kuwait, but
thousands of Westerners are being held.
   Polish workers at Chemadex, which produces chemicals in Al-Qaim,
told the newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza that about 35 Americans were
brought to the factory on Friday, as the Poles were leaving. The
Americans were under guard, the newspaper quoted them as saying.
   Also, workers at a tool factory in Al-Kaiji, 35 miles from
Baghdad, told the newspaper that Iraqi soldiers were moved into the
ground floor of their building, and the soldiers told the workers
their duty was to guard Americans who were being brought to the
plant.
   Approximately 3,000 Americans were stranded in Iraq and Kuwait
after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of the emirate.
   At the onset of the Persian Gulf crisis, about 3,000 Polish
workers were in Iraq and another 1,000 in Kuwait. Most were
employed by Polish construction and engineering firms to build
roads and railways.
   Although Poland has joined in the United Nations trade embargo
against Iraq, Poles have so far not been blocked from leaving Iraq
or Kuwait, and several planeloads of evacuees have returned to
Warsaw.

   Black students stayed away from school
in rural Jefferson County for the second day today to protest the
hiring of a white teacher.
   Howard Middle School, which has 653 students, recorded 355
present today, up from 265 Wednesday, said Betty Messer, assistant
to Superintendent Bill McRae.
   The count included 106 black children today, up from 57
Wednesday.
   Some 1,200 black students stayed away when schools opened
Wednesday. Today's attendance figures were not immediately
available from the high school and the elementary school, Messer
said.
   ``I assume that it will be about the same ratio (as the middle
school),'' she said. She said no problems were reported in the
schools.
   Hours after the black student boycott began, the school board
voted to hire a black teacher for the next expected vacancy.
   A meeting Wednesday night organized by the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People produced a list of complaints
to present to school officials. The complaints were not disclosed.
   ``Once the superintendent works to resolve the issue, people
will readily send their children back to school,'' T.H. Poole Sr.,
the NAACP's top official in Florida, said after the meeting.
   ``It's been one of those situations that's been building and
building and building,'' Poole said earlier. ``They've got a
plantation mentality here.''
   The county had planned to hire four black teachers and four
white teachers for the new school year, but earlier this month one
of the blacks took another job in Georgia, said Superintendent Bill
McRae.
   The board hired a white teacher who had resigned at the end of
the last school year but wanted to return when the vacancy emerged.
   The black teacher will replace another teacher expected to take
maternity leave this fall and then another teacher who plans to
retire.
   McRae said school systems throughout Florida are having a hard
time finding qualified black teachers.
   ``I'd love to work with them to solve this problem. It's not in
anybody's best interest to let this continue,'' McRae said.
   About 36 percent of Jefferson's public school teachers are
black, McRae said.
   About 70 percent of the 2,100 students in Jefferson County's
elementary, middle and high schools are black, and most of them
stayed out of school Wednesday, Poole said.

   Mourners wound around the block today to say
farewell to singer Pearl Bailey.
   The Deliverance Evangelical Evangelistic Church opened its doors
at 10 a.m. for the viewing. The service and burial was set for
later today.
   ``I think they should have opened the doors last night,'' said
the Rev. Steven Parks, the West Oak Lane Church of God associate
pastor who was among the first inside.
   Miss Bailey was 72 when she died Friday at Thomas Jefferson
University Hospital after collapsing in her hotel room. The singer
was recuperating from knee surgery. A preliminary autopsy report
indicated she died of heart disease.
   She made her debut in Philadelphia at age 15 by singing ``Poor
Butterfly'' in an amateur contest. Among her best-known
performances was her lead role in the black version of the musical
``Hello, Dolly!'' in the late 1960s.
   ``Miss Bailey was one of the greatest recording artists and one
of the most talented people in the world,'' remarked James Brooks,
a Philadelphia native now living in Los Angeles, as he walked into
the church.
   Brooks said he had met the singer numerous times and made the
trip just for the funeral.
   Miss Bailey had been living in Arizona, but Philadelphia is
where she grew up and where members of her family still live, so
her husband decided it should be the funeral site, said E.B. Smith,
Miss Bailey's road manager.
   Miss Bailey and jazz drummer Louis Bellson Jr. had been married
38 years. He was with her when she collapsed in the hotel room.
   Smith issued an open invitation to the viewing and the funeral,
saying:
   ``Pearl . . . just loved everybody she met. She treated
everybody equally. Those in the orchestra were just as important to
her as those in the balconies. So, anyone who wants to come, let
them come.''
   Police offered no crowd estimate.

   About 40 people, including
African National Congress regional leaders, struggled with police
while being arrested during a demonstration today against human
rights violations.
   No injuries were reported in the four cities where marches were
held.
   However, factional fighting continued to rage in black townships
today. Four people were killed as police fired tear gas to separate
rival Xhosa and Zulu war bands that fought running clashes and
burned houses.
   The ANC and President F.W. de Klerk said the factions will meet
to try to halt violence that has killed more than 500 people, but
they gave no date.
   The human rights marches were held in Cape Town; Vereeniging,
near Johannesburg; Bloemfontein, to the south; and the Gazankulu
homeland in the northern Transvaal.
   In Cape Town, about 40 people marched on the South African
Transport Services' Culemborg building, which they claim is a
police torture center.
   Cheryl Carolus, a regional ANC leader and a South African
Communist Party leader, called Culemborg ``the one place where the
most consistent stories and allegations of torture of our people
have taken place.''
   Ms. Carolus and other protesters were shoved into a police van
outside the building. Also arrested was Trevor Manuel, regional
coordinator of the ANC, who struggled with police officers before
being forced into the van.
   The ANC-organized demonstration was to protest the continued
detention of ANC members under the Internal Security Act, which
permits indefinite detention with no access to lawyers in cases
involving state security.
   Organizers said they received City Council permission for the
march, but had not asked a magistrate for permission to hold the
demonstration.
   A police officer who declined to be named said those arrested
would be able to pay a fine and be released.
   Thousands of students from the Sebokeng black township also
marched in Vereeniging, calling for improved schools and education.
In Bloemfontein, thousands of ANC supporters marched to the
security police office to hand over a list of demands, including an
end to indefinite detentions and release of Mac Maharaj, an ANC
leader.
   Thousands of people stayed away from work and school in
Gazankulu to take part in separate marches in Giyani, the capital,
and Malamulele. The marchers called for the resignation of Chief
Minister Hudson Ntsanwisi and for de Klerk to end indefinite
detentions.
   In the factional fighting, Zulus faced off with Xhosas and
others this morning in Kagiso township, west of Johannesburg,
before being separated by police firing tear gas.
   A police spokeswoman, Lt. Henriette Bester, said four people
died, including a woman shot by police trying to stop a crowd from
damaging and looting houses.
   ``I don't care if I die. We just want to fight with the Zulus,''
screamed an enraged Xhosa armed with a butcher knife.
   Fighting between Zulus tied to the conservative Inkatha movement
and Xhosas, mostly ANC followers, has spread through black
townships around Johannesburg since erupting Aug. 12.
   Roaming gangs of Zulus with red headbands looted and burned
several deserted homes, while Xhosas burned houses belonging to
Zulu residents.
   ``There was shooting all night,'' said a local businessman who
would not give his name. ``We have had no sleep. It is an awful
situation.''
   A crowd of township residents pelted police with firebombs,
injuring one officer, Bester said. Police retaliated with tear gas
and birdshot, wounding several people and arrested four.
   Police said other townships were quiet except for scattered
incidents.
   At least 518 people have been killed in the black townships
around Johannesburg since Aug. 12, police said. The fighting, which
began in black townships east of Johannesburg, is considered the
most serious violence since nationwide unrest in the mid-1980s.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who cut short a visit to
Canada, toured parts of the Tokoza township Thursday where the
fighting began. Press reports say he has called for an
international peacekeeping force to halt the fighting.
   Press reports also said the planned talks between factional
leaders could lead to a meeting between ANC leader Nelson Mandela
and Zulu leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, but that no such meeting was
planned.
   The ANC has refused to meet with Buthelezi and blames Inkatha
for spreading the fighting from Natal Province to the black
townships near Johannesburg.

<HEAD>Church Official: Marino Stops Payments to Vicki Long</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Atlanta Archbishop Eugene Marino, who
resigned after having an affair with Vicki Long, has stopped
sending her money, a church spokesman said.
   ``It is my understanding that he has not sent her any money
after the end of July and he does not intend to send her any of his
own money in the future,'' the Rev. Peter Dora said Wednesday.
   Published reports said Ms. Long received $14,000 in money orders
from May through July from the New York town where Marino has been
secluded.
   As archbishop, Marino was paid $1,500 a month and receives the
same amount from a pension fund, Dora said. He emphasized that any
money sent to Ms. Long was Marino's personal money.
   ``There are no diocese funds going to her at this time, there
will be no money in the future and there will be no settlement on
any claims she might make against the archdiocese in this regard,''
Dora said.
   Marino, 56, was the highest ranking black Roman Catholic when he
resigned in July, citing health reasons. The church has since
confirmed that the relationship with Ms. Long, a 27-year-old
Riverdale woman, led to his resignation.
   Ms. Long, who has also said she had relationships with two other
priests and a nun, claims she and Marino were married in 1988.
   A four-member panel headed by Coca-Cola President Donald R.
Keough is investigating the church's financial records to determine
if church money was improperly paid to Ms. Long.
   Church officials have acknowledged paying about $15,000 in
medical bills for Ms. Long, whose attorneys have sought additional
financial compensation, claiming that she was sexually exploited by
the archbishop. No lawsuit has been filed, and the church said it
will pay no more money.

<TEXT>
   The United States will not bow to Iraqi
threats or abandon hostages caught up in the Middle East crisis,
Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
today.
   ``We know that it is better to obtain peace by standing up to
aggression early so you don't have to fight a war,''' Powell said
in a speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Baltimore.
   ``We will defend our interests,'' the general said in a text of
the speech released at the Pentagon. ``Don't try to scare or
threaten us. It won't work, never has _ and especially not threats
from Saddam Hussein.''
   Powell added that the United States ``has always come to the aid
of our friends and fellow citizens.
   ``We will not abandon them when they are hostages. And that's
what a guest is who isn't allowed to leave _ a hostage,'' he said.
   Powell, who has played a leading role with Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney in planning and executing Operation Desert Shield in
Saudi Arabia, said Saddam should not doubt American will.
   ``All any Iraqi leader needs to do is look at the history of
American valor and sacrifice in the 20th century. There lies all
the proof he needs of American will. There lies all the proof he
needs of the strength of our arms and our fighting ability.''
   Powell said the Iraqi people should wonder ``why their leaders
have squandered their wealth to invade their neighbors _ with
nothing to show for it but world condemnation and the deaths of
thousands of innocent people.
   ``Mr. Hussein, the solution to the crisis is simple. Leave
Kuwait. Let the legitimate government return. Use your wealth for
peace, not war,'' the four-star general said.
   Powell also put in a plug for Bush's fiscal 1991 military
budget, which seeks $307 billion. Both the House and the Senate
have attempted to cut back that figure.
   The general said the current crisis proves that the U.S.
military must remain strong and flexible in order to respond to any
crisis.
   ``Saddam Hussein will pass. America's need for strong armed
forces will not pass _ ever,'' Powell said.

   The Rev. Jesse Jackson today said Iraq has
granted him permission to visit as a television journalist.
   ``We have received a communique making the visit possible,''
Jackson said.
   He said Iraq's Foreign Ministry had granted the request from his
new media company, ``The Jesse Jackson Show.''
   ``We have not yet determined precisely the time, but just as
other news organizations have pursued the story, and interviews and
sources to get ground-level, first-hand information, we intend to
pursue that,'' said Jackson.
   Jackson said the State Department had not given him any special
guidance, nor had it discouraged him from the trip.
   ``The unclassified information that is available to all
journalists is available to us as well.''
   Jackson has stressed that he would be making the trip as a
journalist for his new television talk show, not as a diplomat.
Jackson traveled to Syria in 1984 to negotiate the release of a
Navy pilot shot down over that country.
   But Jackson said earlier this week that journalistic
communications could encourage a diplomatic solution to the Persian
Gulf crisis.
   ``The Jesse Jackson Show'' is scheduled to begin next month,
syndicated by Time-Warner Inc., which Jackson said would help
underwrite the trip.

   Saddam was shown sitting in a business suit, patting the Western
children on the head. He was surrounded by army officers and an
interviewer who provided some translation of the conversation.
   One of the officers also repeatedly stroked the head of one
child as Saddam spoke to the young boy. The boys were dresssed in
shorts and T-shirts. Saddam talked briefly with them about playing
sports.
   The Iraqi TV broadcast appeared to be an attempt to show that
the hostages were not being mistreated, and gave Saddam an unusual
forum to repeat the Iraqi position that the hostages were there to
prevent an American attack.

   Part of a Shell Oil Co. refinery burst
into flames this morning, injuring at least two people, officials
said.
   The fire was under control shortly after it broke out and there
were no evacuations, authorities said.
   The fire, fueled by naptha, was still burning at midmorning at
the Shell refinery and manufacturing complex east of Houston, said
plant spokesman Dave McKinney. Naptha is an oily liquid produced in
petroleum distillation.
   Thick smoke was visible for several miles.
   ``There apparently is one unit burning at the complex. We don't
have any indication that it is plantwide,'' said police Capt. W.R.
Koym.
   Shell spokesman Mark Singer said two people were injured.
   One was taken by helicopter to Hermann Hospital in Houston with
burns, Singer said.
   ``A second was sprayed with naptha. That employee was showered
at the complex, and I understand is still at the complex,'' Singer
said.
   ``There is no danger to the community and no apparent danger to
other units,'' he said. ``We do know that all the employees have
been accounted for.''
   The cause of the fire was under investigation, officials said.
   The area was sectioned off while firefighters doused it with
water, Singer said. Firefighters from Shell and other area
companies were fighting the fire along with Deer Park firefighters,
Koym said.

   Three protesters were arrested for an impromptu
protest of U.S. involvement in the Persian Gulf conflict, police
said.
   Sgt. Ralph Gonzales said about a half-dozen protesters who
lacked a parade permit chanted slogans and carried signs with
four-letter words through downtown Wednesday afternoon.
   Travis Morales, leader of the Communist Party's Houston chapter,
was arrested for disorderly conduct and obscene language. Two other
protesters who ran from police were arrested for attempting to
avoid arrest, Gonzales said.
   ``There were protesters there with signs that contained some
obscene language,'' Gonzales said. ``Some of them were also
spouting obscene language.''
   Protesters contend U.S. involvement in the Middle East serves
only to benefit big oil companies, police said.
   Some of the protesters were chanting, ``Hell no, we won't go.''
   Gonzales said officers asked to see a parade permit from the
group and a scuffle broke out, prompting the arrests.

<HEAD>Factory Orders Rebound But Still Indicate Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Factory orders for ``big-ticket'' durable
goods rebounded 2.9 percent in July, the government reported
Thursday. But analysts said the zig-zag performance this year
indicates a listless manufacturing economy that could worsen
because of the Middle East crisis.
   ``Orders have been bouncing up and down and the net effect is a
very weak upward trend,'' said economist Cynthia Latta of
DRI@McGraw-Hill, a Lexington, Mass., economic research firm. ``I
don't actually see the industrial sector in decline, but there's
not much stimulus for expansion there.''
   Economist Thomas Runiewicz of the WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd,
Pa., agreed, but added: ``Since the Middle Eastern crisis, we're in
a different ball game ... it makes things a little tougher than
what we were experiencing before and that was fairly flat.''
   The Commerce Department reported that orders for durable goods _
those expected to last more than three years _ totaled a seasonally
adjusted $128.3 billion after slumping 3.2 percent in June.
   In the first half of the year, orders rose during three months
and fell in the others, including a record 10.5 percent drop in
January. During that time, orders totaled $744.7 billion, a 1.5
percent decline from the same period of 1989.
   The sluggishness in the manufacturing economy has cost 350,000
factory jobs since that sector peaked in March 1989, including
another 7,000 in July, according to Labor Department figures. Drops
in orders normally result in production cutbacks and job layoffs.
   Ms. Latta noted that the July increase included a 5.0 percent
boost in transportation orders, to $34.9 billion, which she said
will not result in any immediate stimulus to the economy.
   ``A lot of that is aircraft and that's production three, four,
five years down the road given the big backlogs that aircraft
manufacturers have,'' she said.
   Excluding transportation, orders would have risen 2.2 percent.
   Defense orders slipped 3.1 percent to $7.6 billion after a 21.9
percent decline a month earlier, but Ms. Latta suggested this
category will pick up because of the Middle East crisis.
   ``There have been a lot of things shipped over to Saudi Arabia''
to support U.S. military forces there, she said. ``There are a lot
of stock piles that will have to be replenished.''
   Orders for non-defense capital goods jumped 10.7 percent to
$40.1 billion. This category often is a barometer of business
investment plans, but analysts were hesitant to read anything into
the July number because of the Mideast uncertainty.
   Orders in all major durable categories rose in July:
non-electrical machinery, up 2.7 percent to $22.4 billion;
electrical machinery, 1.9 percent to $20.4 billion, and primary
metals, 1.5 percent to $11.6 billion.
   Shipments of durable goods slipped 2.0 percent to $124.7 billion
following a 0.6 percent increase in June. Unfilled orders rose 0.7
percent to $501.6 billion, more than offsetting a 0.5 percent
decline a month earlier.

   Heavily armed KGB border troops rolled
tanks up to the Polish-Lithuanian border to prevent unauthorized
crossings Thursday, the 51st anniversary of the pact that allowed
Stalin to seize the Baltic republics.
   Independence activists from Lithuania had hoped to take control
of the border crossing from Soviet authorities in a one-day
demonstration of their desire to open Lithuania to the rest of
Europe.
   On a field about a mile inside the border, an estimated 30,000
rain-drenched Lithuanians took part in a Roman Catholic Mass as
part of the event dubbed ``One European Road.''
   ``They're closing before us the doors to Europe,'' said Petros
Rolofas, one of the organizers. ``Our defense is not tanks, it is
the truth. We want our struggle to be peaceful and not bloody,'' he
said.
   Lithuania and the two other Baltic republics, Latvia and
Estonia, were independent between the two World Wars but lost that
independence as a result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop non-agression
pact the Soviets signed with Nazi Germany in 1939.
   The agreement, signed by Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav
Molotov and Germany envoy Joachim von Ribbentrop, placed the
Baltics and eastern half of Poland in the Soviet sphere of
influence. About a week after it was signed, Germany invaded Poland
to begin World War II. The Soviet Union annexed the Baltics in 1940.
   While Soviet authorities Thursday refused to relinquish control
of the border station between Lithuania and Ogrodniki, Poland, they
did ease controls that normally hinder Poles from crossing the
frontier.
   Assisted by authorities on the Polish side, where there was no
show of force, 1,144 Poles streamed across the border on foot in
small groups during a three-hour period starting at mid-morning.
   They said they came to see Lithuania and seek out long-lost
relatives.
   In addition to Poles and Lithuanians, there were representatives
from the other Baltic republics and Czechoslovakia.
   The official Soviet press agency Tass denounced the
demonstration as an ``intentional, forceful violation'' of the
border.
   ``This extreme propaganda action has an illegitimate character.
It pursues primarily political aims and benefits those who are
interested in whipping up the already nervous situation in
Lithuania,'' Tass said.
   On the field, flags of the Baltic republics mixed with banners
of the Polish Solidarity movement, as well as at least one American
flag. A tent city formed on the field, ringed by dozens of buses.
   As the weather cleared, umbrellas were put away and a more
festive atmosphere took over. Sausages and soft drinks went on sale
and people strolled down to look at the guarded border.
   ``Even though Lithuania has decided on its independence and a
lot of other countries recognized it, at least informally, it's
obvious that the Soviet Union still has Lithuania under annexation
and occupation,'' said Rita Dapkus, a spokeswoman for the
Lithuanian parliament.
   Lithuania declared itself independent on March 11, triggering a
Kremlin economic embargo. Soviet authorities then closed the border
crossing between the republic and Poland.
   Lithuania agreed in June to suspend its declaration while the
Kremlin lifted the embargo and began negotiations on secession.
Those talks are expected to start soon.
   Organizers had hoped to be able to walk all the way to the
Polish border Thursday and welcome Poles coming across, but they
were prevented by the heavy cordon of tanks stationed along the
roadway and by KGB troops in camouflage uniforms with knives in
their belts. Police dogs also patrolled the border zone.
   Independence demonstrators Wednesday night read a declaration by
megaphone to Soviet border guards demanding control of the border.
But guards blared loud music through their speakers to drown them
out.

<HEAD>Britain to Send Second Fighter Squadron to Persian Gulf</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Gulf Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Britain will send a second squadron of Tornado
fighter-bombers to the Persian Gulf, Defense Secretary Tom King
said today. He said the warplanes will likely be based in Bahrain.
   ``We are going entirely for defensive purposes, to safeguard the
territorial integrity of Saudi Arabia,'' King told a news
conference.
   He stressed that Britain will continue to seek the restoration
of the Kuwaiti government, which was overthrown by an Iraqi
invasion on Aug. 2.
   He said Britain is relying on strict enforcement of the U.N.
economic sanctions to compel Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to
withdraw from Kuwait.
   ``We must be sure it is effective, and it is effective quickly.
We have no offensive plans,'' King said.
   He said the government is considering deploying additional
anti-aircraft Rapier missiles and other forces to defend the
Tornado squadron.
   King said the Tornado squadron would provide a round-the-clock
capability to strike against armored forces.
   Britain already has one squadron of 12 Tornados at Dhahran,
Saudia Arabia, and a squadron of Jaguar ground-attack aircraft in
Oman.
   A spokesman for the Royal Air Force said a squadron is ``usually
a dozen'' aircraft, but would give no further details.
   The Foreign Office, meanwhile, said it has accounted for all
British citizens detained in Kuwait and believes that none of them
are being held at military installations.
   The Foreign Office said today it believed that 135 Britons have
been detained in Kuwait, two fewer than the total announced on
Wednesday.
   ``We believe that those originally held at a military
installation may have been transferred to civilian establishments
in Kuwait City,'' said a Foreign Office official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   There was no evidence that any of the detainees had been
mistreated, the Foreign Office official said.
   A Foreign Office spokesman said the embassy in Kuwait estimates
that there are 3,000 British citizens in that country, about a
thousand fewer than previously estimated.
   A half-dozen staff members at the British Embassy left Kuwait
City this morning, the Foreign Office said, but four others will
remain in defiance of an Iraqi order that all embassies in Kuwait
be closed on Friday. Mrs. Thatcher has said Britain will maintain
an embassy in Kuwait as long as it is possible.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Afghan
President Najibullah met Thursday and discussed the problems their
nations face, the Soviet news agency Tass reported.
   They also discussed events in Iraq, but Tass provided few
details.
   Najibullah had been reported on vacation in the Soviet Union.
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze also joined the talks.
   Najibullah told Gorbachev and Shevardnadze his government is
trying to bring a peaceful end to his nation's civil war and said
Afghanistan was moving toward normalization and reconciliation,
Tass said.
   Najibullah has been locked in a struggle with rebels seeking to
oust his Soviet-backed government. The Soviet Union sent troops
into Afghanistan in 1979 to back Najibullah's troops. It withdrew
its troops last year.
   Gorbachev outlined some of the major problems in the Soviet
Union, which forced him to return to Moscow sooner than he had
planned, Tass said. He said everything would be done to take the
edge off the nation's social and economic problems.
   ``The decisions to be taken soon will strengthen the position of
the Soviet Union as one of the major players in international
politics,'' Gorbachev said.

<HEAD>White House Says Ambassador, Marines Won't Leave Embassy in Kuwait</HEAD>

   The United States is evacuating some
personnel from its embassy in Kuwait but will leave its ambassador
and a staff of Marines for protection, the White House said today.
   But White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater refused to discuss
whether the Marines would fight any intruding Iraqis.
   ``Their instructions are the same as they've always been. They
provide security for the embassy building itself and the staff that
remains in it. There's no change in that,'' Fitzwater told
reporters here.
   He turned aside several questions on whether the Marines' orders
could mean an outbreak of hostilities if the Iraqis forcibly try to
close down the embassy on Friday as they have ordered.
   ``We don't want to get into any kind of speculation that
complicates or invites trouble,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``Things are changing very rapidly. We are not trying to pin
down specific instructions or any kind of pronouncement that might
cause problems or constitute threats.''
   He said the non-essential embassy staff, reportedly numbering
more than half of the 120-member staff, were being transferred to
Baghdad in hopes of arranging transportation for them out of the
country from there.
   Iraq, in attempt to solidify its occupation of Kuwait in the
face of international opposition, ordered the Western embassies
closed by Friday, as tension in the region remains high.
   Fitzwater said Ambassador Nathaniel Howell will remain to assist
other Americans who want to leave the Iraqi-controlled nation.
There are an estimated 2,500 Americans in Kuwait.
   Fitzwater met with reporters a day after President Bush brought
the Persian Gulf crisis into thousands of American homes by
ordering the nation's military reserves to active duty.
   Officials say the order will take about 40,000 reserve
specialists from their civilian jobs and put them in military posts
to bolster the U.S. buildup.
   Bush also said he was undecided whether to wait for United
Nations backing before using force to sustain the trade embargo
against Iraq.
   The president, stressing the international condemnation of
Iraq's occupation of neighboring Kuwait, left open the question of
whether he would militarily enforce the trade embargo against Iraq
without United Nations approval.
   He told reporters his administration has ``all the authority we
need'' to intercept ships to enforce the U.N.-endorsed economic
embargo. But he left a doubt about whether he would take such
action.
   ``At this juncture I'm not prepared to say whether we're going
to insist on U.N. action before we go further. But I think the
signal must go out to the world that many countries are prepared to
fully enforce these sanctions,'' the president said.
   Bush spoke to reporters after he met at his seaside home with
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence
Eagleburger.
   Bush today continued his Kennebunkport vacation, and tonight
planned to attend a fund-raising event for Republican David Emery's
Maine congressional campaign and New Hampshire Gov. Judd Gregg's
bid for re-election.
   Bush's executive order calling up the reserves will result in
activation of prsonnel in specialized jobs including airlift, food
and water handling, surface transportation, cargo handling, medical
services, construction and intelligence, the White House said.
   Fitzwater said the call-up was not expected to involve the full
200,000 reservists Bush may activate without getting congressional
approval. However, the president did notify the leaders of the
House and Senate that he was activating the nation's reserve forces.
   Asked about reports that Jordan is letting goods be shipped into
Iraq, Bush said, ``I'm not sure I know the total facts.''
   Bush said Jordan's King Hussein, in a visit to Kennebunkport
last week, had assured him that he supported the economic embargo.
But the monarch left unclear whether his country would allow food
or humanitarian supplies to cross the border.
   Kuwait's ambassador to the United States accused Jordan on
Wednesday of collaborating with the Iraqis.
   ``I don't think that the credibility of His Majesty King Hussein
is any longer of any value,'' Sheikh Saud Nasir Al-Sabah told a
Washington news conference after the monarch announced he would
hold new talks with Arab leaders in an effort to defuse the crisis.
   Meanwhile, the State Department said it now is advising
Americans in Kuwait to ``plan their route carefully'' if they try
to flee the country overland despite orders to Iraqi forces to
arrest anyone identified as a U.S. citizen. Previously, the
department had advised Americans not to try to leave Kuwait without
permission. About 500 Americans ignored the advice and got out.
   Bush declined to answer when asked about a report that the
Soviet Union still had 193 military advisers in Iraq despite the
United Nations embargo Moscow has supported. ``At this point, I
would say we are getting superb cooperation from the Soviets,'' he
said.
   Bush said he would encourage energy conservation in light of the
Persian Gulf crisis. But he also said he would not give up rides in
his gas-guzzling speedboat Fidelity, and he said the oil supply
situation is not serious enough to keep people home from their
vacations.

   The United States and Iraq were on a collision course today over
Baghdad's bid to close embassies in occupied Kuwait. Iraq said
defying the order would be an ``act of aggression'' but Washington
warned enforcing it would be a mistake.
   One report quoted Iraqi sources as saying embassies that failed
to close by Friday as ordered would be surrounded by troops.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said that would be a ``mistake'' on
the Iraqis' part.
   Iraqi TV broadcast a tape of an unusual meeting between the
Iraqi president and a group of Western hostages, in which the
smiling Saddam Hussein talked with children and told them their
presence in Iraq was to prevent a war.
   The broadcast appeared to be an attempt to demonstrate that
those held in Iraq are not being mistreated and gave Saddam a
chance to repeat that Westerners were interned only to prevent an
American attack on Iraq.
   The tape showed a group of adults and children who were not
fully identified. Saddam chatted with them, smiled and patted
children on the head during the meeting. He said he was sorry they
were being held and that ``it will not be for too long.''
   Meanwhile, more foreigners _ Japanese, this time _ were reported
today to have been moved from the emirate to the Iraqi capital.
Thousands of foreigners, including about 3,000 Americans, are
trapped in Iraq and Kuwait, and Saddam has said they will serve as
human shields against attack.
   It appeared that strategy was being carried out. Polish workers
arriving home from Iraq told the Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza
today that last week, as they left the Iraqi chemical factory where
they had been working, about three dozen Americans arrived under
guard.
   Iraq also gave even stronger indications it would use the
trapped foreigners to try to chip away at international support for
sanctions against Iraq and the multinational force deployed in the
Persian Gulf region.
   Three weeks after Iraq's lightning takeover of Kuwait, tensions
were running high throughout the Mideast.
   An Israeli civil defense official today urged citizens to stock
up on food, tape their windows shut and mix a homemade antidote to
defend against a possible Iraqi chemical attack.
   Washington, which has deployed thousands of troops to the
region, called reserves to duty and sent minesweepers to the
Persian Gulf.
   Saddam, in what Iraqi media billed as an open letter to
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, today denounced Egypt for sending
troops to join U.S. and other forces in the defense of Saudi
Arabia, and said Arab leaders who failed to support Arab causes did
not deserve to rule. His statement was read by an announcer on
Iraqi television.
   The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council met
again today. The United States has been prodding Moscow to endorse
the use of force to back up the embargo against Iraq.
   A pair of United Nations envoys were wrapping up talks in Iraq
today, but reportedly received a cold reception. Iraqi Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz told the two that the U.N. Security Council had
become ``an American tool,'' the Iraqi News Agency reported.
   Jordan was still not complying with U.N. sanctions against Iraq.
At the Jordanian border today, heavy two-way commercial traffic
continued, reporters said.
   Jordan, overburdened by thousands of people fleeing Iraq and
Kuwait, had said it would close its border to foreigners today, but
it was allowing thousands of refugees to cross over. Nearly all are
Arabs.
   The crisis reverberated in financial markets. Share prices in
Tokyo dived nearly 1,500 points today, or a 5.8 percent drop _ the
fourth-largest daily drop in its history. Stock prices were down in
London as well, and Wall Street's Dow Jones average fell nearly 44
points on Wednesday.
   Crude oil prices topped $30 a barrel for the first time since
November 1985, closing at $31.22 a 42-gallon barrel Wednesday on
the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Sources close to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries said today some OPEC nations would gather this weekend to
consult informally about the skyrocketing oil prices. The sources,
who demanded anonymity, said oil ministers from at least three
nations _ Algeria, Indonesia and Nigeria _ were expected to hold
talks in Vienna.
   On the embassy shutdown order, Iraq's information minister today
warned foreign governments not to try to keep their missions open.
   ABC News, citing Iraqi sources in Baghdad, said troops would
surround each diplomatic mission in Kuwait that remained open after
the deadline. The unidentified sources said the troops may prevent
food from going into the buildings, which would be ``put under
virtual siege.''
   ``If they stay, they will be acting against our sovereignty.
That would be equivalent to an act of aggression,'' the Iraqi
official, Latif Nassif Jassem, told the French daily newspaper Le
Figaro.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said today the United States and
others have made it clear they would deem a shutdown of the
embassies ``an illegal act.''
   ``We don't recognize the Iraqi annexation of Kuwait, and I think
most of us are determined to keep our embassies open,'' he said
today on ABC. ``I think it would be a mistake for Saddam Hussein to
try to close down all those embassies in Kuwait.'' But, Cheney
added, ``He's done foolish things before.''
   The United States said it would cut embassy staff but pledged to
keep the outpost open. Britain, with 3,000 of its citizens stranded
in Iraq and Kuwait, and other nations announced similar plans
earlier.
   But Lebanon and India said today they would comply with the
shutdown order.
   The Iraqi information minister, also in the interview with Le
Figaro, linked the fate of French citizens in Iraq to their
government's stance on sanctions and participation in the
multinational force.
   ``If France distances itself from the polices of the United
States, we would take it into account concerning our decisions
about the free movement of its nationals and their right to
travel,'' Jassem said.
   Meanwhile, Japanese government said today that about 180
Japanese have been moved from Kuwait to a hotel in Baghdad and that
all but a handful have been denied permission to leave for Jordan.
   The move came after Japan indicated it planned to aid Jordan in
offsetting the loss of vital trade with Iraq as a result of U.N.
sanctions.
   The U.N. move on aid to Jordan came after an urgent U.N.
Security Council meeting late Wednesday night. Aid to other
countries affected by U.N. sanctions also was discussed, but
diplomats said no particular figures were discussed.
   Heavy trucks and other commercial traffic passed through the
Jordanian-Iraqi border today, indicating Jordan had not implemented
sanctions.
   Jordan's King Hussein had said he was closing the border at
midnight Wednesday because the flood of foreign refugees, mostly
Arabs, from Iraq and Iraqi-occupied Kuwait had strained the
resources of his small nation.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney today approved
plans to call as many as 49,703 military reservists to active duty
to bolster the American buildup of forces in Saudi Arabia, a
Pentagon spokesman announced.
   Some members of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Coast Guard
reserve forces could get the call as early as Friday, said Cheney's
press secretary, Pete Williams.
   ``We will call up only what we need, and only when we need it,''
Williams said.
   Cheney approved the reserve call-up plans presented at a
Pentagon meeting with the service chiefs. President Bush on
Wednesday authorized the first activation of U.S. reserve forces
since the Vietnam War.
   Williams said most reserves put on active duty will be sent to
the Persian Gulf area. Others would be placed in domestic posts
vacated by troops sent to Saudi Arabia, while some could go to
Europe if some U.S. forces from NATO countries are sent to the
Middle East.
   Williams said that by Aug. 31, the Army could call to active
duty as many as 4,912 members of the Army National Guard and the
Army Reserve; by Oct. 1 the figure could rise as high as 24,734.
   The Navy plans to call up 3,213 members of the Navy Reserve by
Aug. 31, and an additional 3,030 by Oct. 1, Williams said.
   The Air Force call-up of members of the Air National Guard and
the Air Force Reserve will be 1,002 by Aug. 31 and a total of
14,476 by Oct. 1.
   The Coast Guard plans to call as many as 700 members of the
Coast Guard Reserve by Aug. 31, and another 550 by Oct. 1.
   Williams said the Marine Corps asked for and received authority
from Cheney to call up as many as 3,000 members of the Marines
Corps Reserves by Oct. 1, but that the Marines did not expect to
actually call any of those to active duty.
   Williams also said Cheney gave the service chiefs the authority
to delay the planned retirements and departures from active duty of
those soldiers, sailors and airmen ``in selected critical areas''
deemed vital to the Saudi Arabian deployment.
   Williams said he could provide no figures on how many active
duty personnel would have their retirements or unit separations
delayed.
   Among the Army reserves to be put on active duty, about half
will perform jobs such as handling of fuel, food, water and
ammunition supplies, plus truck transport, Williams said. Most of
these tasks would be done in or around Saudi Arabia, he said.
   The Navy plans to call reservists with skills in dock handling
and medical services, while the Air Force needs pilots for
long-range supply flights to Saudi Arabia, Williams said.
   The call-up of reserves will be for an initial 90-day period,
Williams said. Bush has the authority to extend a call-up for
another 90 days without declaring a national emergency.
   Williams said he could not say whether more reserves would be
called up beyond the 49,703 that Cheney has authorized.
   ``I don't think anybody knows what's going to happen beyond Oct.
1,'' he said. ``If there's an act of aggression (by Iraq) perhaps
these numbers will have to be reviewed.''
   The shift toward greater reliance on reserves began with the end
of the draft in 1973 but has gone largely unnoticed outside the
military, private analysts said.
   ``This shifting of responsibility occurred with very little
fanfare or debate, and now everybody seems to be caught by surprise
that we're calling up the reserves in this instance,'' said Martin
Binkin, co-author of a 1989 study on the reserves.
   Short of declaring a national emergency, the president can
mobilize up to 200,000 of the nation's 1.2 million reservists for
up to 180 days. It is up to the Pentagon to determine how the total
number is divided among the services.
   The total active duty force is 2.1 million.
   The Transportation Department said 40 ships were called up from
the Ready Reserve Force, a fleet of old civilian cargo ships
maintained for quick deployment in emergencies. More ships were
expected to be activated, said Transportation Secretary Samuel
Skinner.
   After the draft was abolished, the Pentagon adopted a ``total
force'' concept that moved many key tasks, such as supply
transport, medical services and communications, away from the
professional soldiers to part-time civilian reservists.
   The change was designed to ensure that no sustained conflict
would be fought without the use of reserves. The idea was that
following the publicly unpopular Vietnam war, the White House would
be forced to measure national resolve early in any future military
crisis by bringing civilians into the fighting force.
   Taking thousands of men and women from their homes and civilian
jobs to serve on active duty means that towns across the country
will come to grips with the human dimension of the gulf crisis and
the personal sacrifice it is requiring.
   Van D. Hipp Jr., deputy assistant secretary of the Army for
reserve forces and mobilization, acknowledged the political
sensitivity of the reserve call-up decision.
   ``We realize the tremendous sacrifice that these reservists and
(National) Guardsmen are going to have to make, and their families
have to make,'' Hipp said in an interview Wednesday.

<HEAD>US Concerned About Soviets Giving Iraq Military Advice</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Inserts grafs 6-7, In Kennebunkport, with comment.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is concerned that the
Soviet Union is still providing military advisers to Iraq, but has
no evidence they are assisting directly in combat operations, U.S.
officials say.
   Even so, the administration officials are suspicious of Soviet
claims the advisers are kept at a distance and are engaged only in
training.
   The officials said the Soviets gave a similar account of their
advisers during Iraq's eight-year Persian Gulf war with Iran
although Soviet advisers were observed near battlefield sites.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
subject did not come up in Secretary of State James A. Baker III's
telephone conversation Wednesday with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   But they said the United States had registered its concern in
the past. The Soviets replied that the advisers had not assisted in
combat operations and the United States has no evidence they had
during the invasion of Kuwait, the officials said.
   In Kennebunkport, Maine, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said, ``The Soviets have continually worked to get their advisers
and citizens out of there.''
   ``Their position has been enormously helpful in terms of the
latitude that's been given for all the countries of the world to
pursue their opposition to this aggression,'' Fitzwater said.
   On Wednesday, Col. Valentin Ogurtsov said in Moscow that 193
unarmed military experts were finishing their ``contractual
obligations'' to show Iraqis how to use tanks, jet fighters and
missiles, and to maintain and repair the hardware.
   The Soviets joined the U.S. economic blockade of Iraq from the
outset following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   The United Nations Security Council voted 13-0 to approve the
economic embargo Aug. 6 and by unanimous vote on Aug. 9 declared
Iraq's annexation of the smaller Persian Gulf country to be void.
   The embargo includes a cutoff of arms shipments. But over the
years the Soviets have been a major arms supplier to Baghdad.
Another is France.
   Baker, who is on vacation in Wyoming, sought Shevardnadze's help
Wednesday in enforcing the economic embargo.
   The response from Moscow was a request for a slowdown at the
United Nations, where the United States is pushing for a military
blockade.
   But the officials said Shevardnadze did not threaten a Soviet
veto or any other effort to stop the U.S. campaign.
   In fact, the officials said, the Soviets are using their close
ties to Iraq to urge the release of Westerners, including
Americans, trapped in Iraq and Kuwait.
   In any event, the Bush administration asserts it already has
legal authority to enforce the embargo _ with or without a new U.N.
resolution.
   Baker went on his Wyoming vacation last week, leaving Deputy
Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger in charge at the State
Department. Baker also talks frequently to Bush by telephone as
well as to other senior officials, including Brent Scowcroft, the
president's national security adviser.
   Bush on Wednesday described Soviet cooperation with the economic
sanctions as ``superb.''
   Soviet support is critical. As a permanent member of the U.N.
Security Council the Soviets could block any resolution with a
veto. And Moscow has had a long and warm relationship with Iraq.
   The Soviets want to allow a certain period of time to pass
before adopting a resolution calling for a military blockade, the
officials said.
   One reason is the presence in Moscow of a senior Iraqi diplomat,
Deputy Prime Minister Sadun Hammadi. He has met with Shevardnadze,
Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov and Igor Belonsov, who is overseeing
the evacuation of Soviet citizens from the gulf.
   The Soviets would like to wait at least until Hammadi concludes
his visit before approving a military blockade, the officials said.
   ``I don't think we are in serious disagreement,'' a U.S.
official said. ``But the Soviets are hesitant to move as quickly as
we'd like to in enforcing the sanctions. They are not working
against us, but we are looking for their support, not just their
acquiescence.''

<TEXT>
   Oil prices shot over $32 a barrel today to a
seven-year high as traders worried that fighting in the Middle East
could knock out Saudi Arabian production.
   ``Again, it's the possibility of war and the probability of
damage to Saudi oilfields if a war did occur,'' Ann-Louise Hittle,
a senior oil analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., said
today. ``The focus is very much on concern that there might be an
escalation.''
   In early trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, light
sweet crude hit $32.10 per barrel for October delivery, up 93 cents
from the previous close. The last time the price broke $32 at the
Merc was on Aug. 16, 1983.
   On Wednesday, crude soared over $30 per barrel on the Merc,
breaking a threshold that had not been touched since November 1985.
   Unleaded gasoline futures, which hit their sixth straight record
close on Wednesday, moved up more than 3 cents per gallon to $1.075
on September contracts this morning.
   ``What the market is looking for at this point is a clear sign
that there will not be any military escalation,'' Hittle said.
``It's still nervous. Everybody is still buying. If there's a
change in the political or military situation, then we'll see a
change for sure, but I can't predict that.''
   Analysts said world supplies were starting to feel the crunch of
4 million barrels of crude lost each day through the boycott of
Iraq and Kuwait.
   Indications that Saudi Arabia and Venezuela want to increase
production have not materialized. Also, the Saudi Arabians
curtailed some previously arranged sales of jet fuel and other
products to accommodate the massive military buildup on their soil.
   Oil industry watchers said consumers will be paying even more
for gasoline at the pump, although analysts said there was no firm
way to translate the rise in futures prices to a predictable rise
in retail prices.
   One analyst said a 1-cent rise in unleaded futures can mean a
1-cent increase at the pump.
   Wall Street traders were generally surprised by the abrupt jump
of crude over the $30 per barrel mark.
   ``As long as this standoff continued, I had expected pretty
volatile markets in the $25 to $30 range,'' said Stephen Smith, an
oil analyst with Bear Stearns &amp; Co.
   Inventories of oil available to the world market have declined
by about 80 million barrels, from the 250 million barrel range,
since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, Smith said.
   In other products traded on the Merc this morning, home heating
oil for September delivery jumped up more than 4 cents per gallon
to a price of 96 cents, while natural gas was up from $1.56 to
$1.60 per 1,000 cubic feet for October contracts.

next Monday and Tuesday, the White House said Thursday.
   Mulroney and his wife, Mila, and their children also were guests
at Bush's seaside vacation home last August.
   The two leaders plan to discuss a number of world issues,
focusing primarily on the Persian Gulf crisis, White House Press
Secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters.
   The Mulroneys are scheduled to arrive Monday and leave Tuesday
after spending the night with the vacationing Bush and his wife

<HEAD>Nine Smugglers Arrested After Deputies Rescue 92 Illegal Aliens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LA PUENTE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deputies rescued 92 illegal immigrants
who were allegedly held captive inside a one-story house by nine
smugglers demanding ransom, authorities said.
   Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said dozens of people had
been locked inside a 8-by-20-foot room. Others were locked inside
three small bedrooms.
   ``It was a terrible place,'' said Deputy Rich Erickson.
   Acting on a tip, deputies Wednesday broke into the house in La
Puente, about 25 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, and discovered
the immigrants and nearly $19,000 in cash, sheriff's Sgt. Bob
Olmsted said.
   The nine alleged captors were taken to the sheriff's station in
Industry, Deputy Mariano Zamudio said Thursday. Their identities
were not immediately available.
   Investigators believed they were so-called ``coyotes,'' people
who make a clandestine business out of bringing immigrants
illegally across the border.
   Investigators said the smuggling ring likely had operated for
some time, although some immigrants said they had been in the house
for a few days.
   The 92 people from El Salvador and Mexico were in the custody of
Immigration and Naturalization Service officials.
   According to Zamudio, the sheriff's department and the INS were
to determine what, if any, charges would be filed against the
smugglers and to decide the fate of the illegal immigrants.
   Olmsted said the smugglers allegedly had demanded up to $1,000
from relatives of the captives for their release. Many of the
immigrants had already paid similar amounts to be transported to
Los Angeles, he said.
   Investigators raided the house after a relative of one of the
captives told officials she was being forced to pay an additional
$1,000 to free a nephew, Olmsted said.

<TEXT>
   ``Trump The Game'' may have
stumped some players.
   At least that's the explanation Donald Trump offered Thursday in
response to those who said the board game hasn't sold as well as
expected.
   It was unveiled last year with a personal visit from Trump and
glowing sales forecasts at East Longmeadow-based Milton Bradley Co.
   ``I don't think over-the-counter sales ever made it up to the
levels that Milton Bradley thought it would,'' said John G. Taylor,
an analyst with L.H. Alton &amp; Co. in San Francisco.
   Analysts said the personal downturn in the real estate tycoon's
fortunes probably had little effect on the game's sales.
   ``Were Mr. Trump still at the height of his power and prestige
the sales results of `Trump The Game' would not have fared any
better,'' said toy industry analyst David Leibowitz, senior vice
president of American Securities in New York.
   Milton Bradley officials, who had planned to produce 2 million
games, did not return repeated telephone calls Wednesday and
Thursday from The Associated Press. Company President George
Ditomassi was quoted in Wednesday's editions of the Union-News in
Springfield as saying the game was a disappointment.
   Trump, who is donating his proceeds of the game to charity, said
the game sold 800,000 copies, which were priced at $25 to $30 each,
and he believed his donations have amounted to $1 million.
   ``How many games sell 800,000?'' he asked. ``I think it was too
complicated a game. The word of mouth was that the complexity of
the game hurt it.''
   The game is a sophisticated battle in which players first bid
against each other for airlines, casinos, luxury hotels and other
Trump properties and then try to negotiate deals.
   Since the game's release, Trump has had to battle to save his
real-life empire. Wednesday, he completed signing documents related
to a bailout package and received the first installment of $65
million in new loans.
   The New Jersey Casino Control Commission on Tuesday approved
Trump's plan to put up his three Atlantic City casinos as
collateral for a $65 million bank loan he received to make a $43
million bond payment on the Trump Castle casino.
   Taylor termed the game's performance ``more sizzle than steak.''
   ``It was a timely introduction, it was consistent with some of
the things that were regularly in the press in those days, and yet
it seemed to be something that was more popular in the tabloid area
than the toy store,'' he said.

<HEAD>Prosecutor: Cult Leader Said He Helped Christ off Cross</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A cult leader charged with killing a
family of five said he had a vision that he had helped take Christ
off the cross, a prosecutor said Thursday.
   ``He claimed that he had visions,'' Lake County Prosecutor
Steven LaTourette told jurors in his opening statement for the
murder trial of Jeffrey Lundgren.
   ``He claimed that he was in Christ's head looking through
Christ's eyes as Christ died on the cross,'' LaTourette said. ``He
claimed to have a vision that he helped bring Christ from the
cross.''
   LaTourette said Lundgren manipulated his scriptural
interpretations to persuade his followers to help kill Dennis and
Cheryl Avery and their three young daughters, ages 7, 13 and 15.
The Averys were shot to death last year and buried on the Kirtland
farm where most of the cult members lived.
   ``This defendant conned these once-good people into supporting
him and his family,'' he said. ``The evidence will reflect that he
convinced them to participate with him in the deaths of five
people.''
   Authorities said the Averys may have been killed in a
soul-cleansing ritual for the other cult members before they moved
to wilderness campsites in West Virginia and Missouri. Prosecutors
also have said the Averys may have been targeted because Lundgren
felt they were not sufficiently loyal to the cult.
   Lundgren, 40, a defrocked lay minister of the Reorganized Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, is charged with five counts
each of aggravated murder and kidnapping and could face the death
penalty if convicted.
   His wife, Alice, 39, has been convicted of five counts each of
kidnapping, conspiracy and complicity in the April 17, 1989, deaths
and is to be sentenced next Wednesday.
   Lundgren's attorney, Charles Grieshammer, said in his opening
statement that the defense would not contest the allegation that
Lundgren killed the five.
   ``We are not going to dispute that,'' Grieshammer said.
   However, he said, ``There are a number of conclusions and a
number of inferences which we will dispute.''
   The jurors and alternates on Wednesday walked through knee-high
grass to tour the 15-acre farm where Lundgren led his cult, whose
members practiced paramilitary maneuvers and were preparing to meet
God.
   Lundgren declined to accompany the jury to the farm, about 30
miles northeast of Cleveland. His attorneys wouldn't comment on why
he waived the chance to visit the scene.
   Mrs. Lundgren visited the farm with the jury that later
convicted her of helping to mastermind the slayings. She showed
little emotion during her trial but wept at the farm.
   The Lundgrens' son, Damon, 19, and five other cult members are
awaiting trials and five others have pleaded guilty and await
sentencing.

   The republic of Armenia passed a declaration of
independence on Thursday and Estonia began formal negotiations with
the Kremlin on separation, bringing the Soviet Union closer to
fragmentation.
   The central Asian republic of Turkmenia, meanwhile, declared
itself sovereign with the right to overturn Soviet laws.
   Armenia, a republic of 3.3 million people on the border with
Turkey and Iran, is the fifth of the Soviet Union's 15 republics to
move toward complete independence from the Soviet Union.
   However, its path may be complicated by the bloody two-year
conflict with neighboring Azerbaijan over the disputed territory of
Nagorno-Karabakh.
   The declaration calls for creation of Armenia's own armed forces
to safeguard the border, which this week was again the scene of
violent conflict with Azerbaijanis. The declaration also calls for
Nagorno-Karabakh, a largely Armenian area of Azerbaijan, to become
part of Armenia.
   The Armenian resolution ``declares the beginning of the process
of establishing independent statehood,'' according to an English
translation sent to The Associated Press.
   Armenian legislator Samvel Shakhmuradyan said he expects the
republic to remain part of the Soviet Union only during an
undefined transition period to complete separation.
   Armenia's decision increases pressure on President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, who is struggling to develop a new union treaty
attractive enough to keep his nation whole. However, Gorbachev
seems to be bowing to Baltic demands for complete independence.
   Kremlin officials began formal negotiations with the Baltic
republic of Estonia on Thursday, the 51st anniversary of the
Nazi-Soviet pact that led to Soviet annexation of the Baltic
states. The two other Baltics, Latvia and Lithuania, are expected
to begin independence negotiations with Soviet representatives
soon. Georgia has also asked for talks with the Kremlin on
independence.
   The Estonian and Soviet delegations plan to meet weekly for two
months and present a final document to Gorbachev's Presidential
Council by the end of October, Tass said.
   Seven republics have declared sovereignty, or the right to
overturn Soviet laws on their territory. The republic of Turkmenia
passed such a declaration Thursday, joining Russia _ the largest
Soviet republic _ the Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Byelorussia, Moldavia
and Uzbekistan.
   Armenia's parliament rejected a radical proposal to declare
independence effective immediately, as well as a Communist Party
proposal to be ``independent but remain in the Soviet Union, said
Raffi Hovannisian, an Armenian-American who watched the debate.
   The resolution was approved by a vote of 183-2, Shakhmuradyan
said in a telephone interview from Yerevan, the capital of the
small republic. The resolution invalidates the Soviet Constitution
on Armenian territory and says that only the Armenian Constitution
is in effect, Shakhmuradyan said.
   It demands a share of the Soviet national wealth, including
gold, diamonds and foreign currency reserves. It calls for the
creation of Armenia's own currency, banking system and customs
duties.
   It also claims Armenia's right to conduct its own foreign policy
and to bar other nations' troops and bases from its territory, a
clear reference to the Soviet armed forces.
   However, the declaration also states that Armenia ``has its
share of the U.S.S.R. military,'' without explaining.
   The republic is already boycotting the Soviet military draft and
few of its youths appeared at recruiting centers this year.
   The declaration also changes the name of the ``Armenian Soviet
Socialist Republic'' to the ``Republic of Armenia.''
   It says Armenia will have a multiparty political system and
freedom of expression, press and religion, Tass reported. It calls
for separation of legislative, executive and judiciary powers,
grants citizenship to all residents of the republic, and offers it
to any Armenians living outside its borders.
   Armenia's president, Levon Ter-Petrosyan, said it was a historic
decision allowing the republic to set its own ``relations with the
world,'' including neighboring Azerbaijan, the independent news
agency Interfax reported.
   Ter-Petrosyan has said that taking control of its own affairs
should help Armenia solve its problems with Azerbaijan.
   However, Azerbaijani president Ayaz Mutalibov on Tuesday urged
Soviet sanctions against Armenia following Armenian debate on
creating its own armed forces. Mutalibov was angered because
Armenia has not yet disarmed paramilitary groups blamed for clashes
on the border with Azerbaijan.
   A three-day battle erupted this week along the republics'
border. Tass reported Thursday that Soviet troops backed by tanks
and helicopters drove out Armenian militants who had been shelling
the Kazakh region of Azerbaijan.
   Several local residents and troops were killed and wounded and
100 homes were destroyed in the shelling, Tass said.

   About 245 Japanese have been flown from Kuwait to
virtual house arrest in Baghdad, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
The move comes as Japan debates measures to help enforce the U.N.
embargo of Iraq.
   The Iraqis moved almost all the Japanese stranded in Kuwait
after the Iraqi invasion to Baghdad on Wednesday and Thursday,
Japanese officials said. Eight Japanese were sent on to safety in
Jordan, the officials said.
   The Japanese have been placed in a hotel under what amounts to
house arrest, according to the Foreign Ministry. The Japanese
ambassador, Kunio Katakura, was forcibly removed when he tried to
visit them, the official said.
   In Ankara, Turkey, Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama said in a
statement that Japanese diplomats had been unable to contact the
Japanese nationals.
   He said Iraq's action was ``a sheer violation of international
law and cannot be tolerated from a humanitarian standpoint.''
   Nakayama made the statement at the end of a trip to Saudi
Arabia, Oman, Jordan, Egypt and Turkey to determine the needs of
countries immediately affected by the crisis.
   U.S. Ambassador Michael H. Armacost told reporters Washington
hopes Japan will become more directly involved in the Middle East
crisis, giving financial support to the United States and Middle
Eastern countries and perhaps even sending military forces.
   This would violate Japan's constitution, which bars the use of
force in settling international disputes. The constitution was
written under U.S. supervision after World War II to prevent the
resurgence of Japanese militarism.
   Japan is considering extending financial aid to countries like
Jordan, Egypt and Turkey _ already Japanese aid clients _ whose
economies have suffered because of the crisis in the Middle East.
But the government says it intends to go beyond checkbook diplomacy
and is considering a physical presence in the Persian Gulf through
medical teams, logistics support, ships or perhaps even
minesweepers.
   Japan has said that in principle it is ready to help Jordan make
up its economic losses if Jordan agrees to abide by U.N. sanctions
against Iraq.
   On Thursday, the Foreign Ministry made a late-night announcement
that 178 Japanese had been moved to Baghdad from Kuwait, and 67
others were in transit.
   Japan is dependent on the Middle East for about 70 percent of
its oil, and received 11.2 percent of its oil needs from Iraq and
Kuwait before the crisis broke out.

<TEXT>
   The nation's top antitrust prosecutor said
Thursday he has summoned the major oil companies for talks to
determine whether they used illegal tactics to drive up gasoline
prices following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   ``I have called the major oil companies and requested that they
come in on a one-by-one basis to meet with the staff and on several
occasions with me,'' said Assistant Attorney General James Rill,
who heads the Justice Department's antitrust division.
   Already, representatives of three major oil companies and two
independent marketers have met with some of the 10 antitrust
officials working on the inquiry, Rill told reporters at the
Justice Department.
   The purpose of the meetings is to have the company
representatives explain the industry's price practices, ``the
circumstances of the sharp increases in detail and the reasons why
those increases have occurred,'' he said.
   ``We are getting cooperation from the major oil companies in
this phase of our inquiry,'' he said, noting that antitrust
officials also are meeting with independent refiners and marketers
of petroleum products.
   Rill declined to say which companies have been contacted and
which have been in for meetings thus far. Each company has been
promised confidentiality, Rill said. However, he would not say
whether they were put under oath or whether any have been granted
immunity from prosecution or other incentives to reveal information.
   ``They have been forthcoming,'' Rill said, adding that the
companies are aware that prosecutions may occur once the inquiry is
completed.
   Thus far, no subpoenas have been issued to compel cooperation,
but Rill said if any companies do refuse to cooperate, ``We'll know
how to deal with them.''
   Rill said he anticipates that the inquiry's general fact-finding
phase should be completed within the next four weeks and that
``will give us a good sense of the underlying events and the most
promising lines of inquiry that it would seem appropriate to pursue
after that.''
   The American Automobile Association says in its weekly survey
that the average price of gasoline at the pump has jumped about 18
percent since Iraq overran Kuwait on Aug. 2. The average pump price
of unleaded regular gasoline jumped from $1.050 on July 25 to
$1.237 on Monday, the AAA reported.
   ``Obviously, there was an event _ the invasion _ that had an
economic impact on crude oil and petroleum product prices in the
nation,'' he said. ``However, we are here to determine whether or
not there were other factors that contributed in the nature of any
collusive or any anti-competitive practices. And we are
aggressively pursuing the possibility that that kind of conduct
might have occurred.''
   Rill had announced Aug. 6 that he was launching such an inquiry.
   The announcement, he said Thursday, was inspired in part to
alert the industry that ``we were on the job and looking for
evidence of illegal conduct.'' In addition, the announcement was
intended to elicit information from potential whistle-blowers.
   In addition to the oil companies, Rill said he has sought the
assistance of state attorneys general for information at the ``pump
price level.''

   The Soviet Union waited until an Iraqi envoy left
town before disclosing Thursday it had urged Baghdad to end its
occupation of Kuwait and stop its ``inhumane'' treatment of
foreigners.
   Iraq's deputy prime minister, Saadoun Hammadi, left Moscow after
meeting Soviet leaders Monday and Tuesday. While he was in Moscow,
the Foreign Ministry issued only sketchy details of his talks.
   On Thursday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh said
Hammadi was told: ``Iraq should change drastically the policy which
it is pursuing now.''
   ``The attention of the Iraqi representative was drawn to the
need to take steps to reduce the tension caused by the
irresponsible actions of the Iraqi authorities,'' Gremitskikh told
a regular news briefing.
   ``We stressed that Baghdad has lost much, politically and
morally, in the eyes of world public opinion by its illegal and
inhumane actions against citizens of third countries.''
   Hundreds of thousands of foreigners were stranded when Iraq
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and subsequently annexed it. Many have not
been allowed to leave and some, including Americans, have
reportedly been moved to military installations throughout the
country.
   ``This is only exacerbating the situation,'' Gremitskikh quoted
Soviet officials as telling Hammadi.
   ``The decision to keep foreigners in the country by force has no
precedent in the history of international relations and cannot be
justified by any arguments, including references to national
security considerations.''
   Gremitskikh said Iraq's argument that it has a historical claim
to Kuwait was ``unconvincing.''
   After the invasion, the Soviet Union cut off arms supplies to
Iraq. Last week, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev accused Iraq of
treachery for invading Kuwait and using Soviet-built weapons to do
so.
   Gremitskikh gave no explanation for the Foreign Ministry's
decision to reveal its message to Hammadi.
   Earlier this week, U.S. officials suggested Hammadi's visit was
linked to Soviet delaying tactics over a U.N. resolution that would
sanction the use of military force to enforce the economic blockade
against Iraq. They said Moscow wanted to wait for Hammadi to leave
before approving the U.S.-sponsored resolution.
   Hammadi met with Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, Soviet
Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov and Deputy Foreign Minister
Alexander Belonogov, who has been handling the Gulf crisis on a
daily basis.
   Gremitskikh said Hammadi told them Iraq was willing to ``show
flexibility'' in the evacuation of foreign citizens ``if the other
sides are flexible as well.''

   Attorneys for Rodney Dangerfield want to bar
allegations the comedian was a chronic drug and alcohol abuser from
his trial against a Las Vegas resort.
   In motions filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court, attorneys for
Dangerfield said the allegations were untrue and without foundation.
   The motions ask that all evidence of alleged substance abuse be
excluded from Dangerfield's civil trial against Caesars Palace,
which was scheduled to begin Monday.
   Dangerfield's attorney, John Lusk, said Thursday the trial has
been postponed until Sept. 10.
   Caesars Palace attorneys filed court papers earlier in the week
claiming Dangerfield smokes marijuana regularly, drinks vodka
heavily and often uses cocaine.
   The claims by the resort were made to show that Dangerfield was
responsible for canceling a series of shows at Caesars in March
1988.
   Dangerfield sued Caesars for $225,000 in disputed contract money
and medical and legal bills, claiming his eyes were burned in a
steam bath accident at the resort.
   Dangerfield, who was then earning $45,000 per show as a Caesars
headliner, canceled several shows after the injury.
   His attorney said he has never seen his client use drugs. The
64-year-old Dangerfield also has denied any drug use.

   Jay Leno, a regular host on ``The Tonight
Show,'' once was rejected by Johnny Carson when he first auditioned
for the show _ but Leno says it was just the kick his comedy career
needed.
   Leno, in Sunday's Parade magazine, recounts how Carson came to
watch his act years ago at The Comedy Store in Los Angeles. When
the show was over, Leno says, his future boss provided this review:
``You seem like a very funny young man, but you're not right for
the show. You don't have enough jokes.''
   Although it was no laughing matter to Leno at the time, he later
appreciated Carson's comments.
   ``I was devastated,'' Leno said. ``I resented what Johnny said,
but I took it to heart and began honing the material _ adding more
jokes, better jokes.
   ``I've always been grateful to him for being so straight, for
giving me the real advice, hard as it seemed at the time.''

   Actor Sean Connery will receive a rare award from
the British Academy of Film and Television Arts for his
``outstanding contribution to world cinema,'' the academy announced
Thursday.
   Connery, who played James Bond in seven films until 1983 before
moving on to other roles, will be only the third recipient of the
academy's Tribute Award. The previous winners were Dirk Bogarde and
Julie Andrews.
   Princess Anne, the academy's president, will present the award
to Connery at a party in London in October.
   Connery, who was born in an Edinburgh tenement, turns 60
Saturday and remains one of the world's top box-office draws. He
won the 1988 Oscar for best supporting actor in ``The Untouchables''
   This year he has starred in three films: ``Family Business''
with Dustin Hoffman, ``Hunt For Red October'' and ``The Russia
House'' with Michelle Pfeiffer. He has just completed filming
``Highlander II'' in Buenos Aires.

   Prince Charles will get a bone graft to help
repair a painful fracture in his right arm, Buckingham Palace
announced Thursday.
   Charles, 41, broke his upper right arm in two places when he
fell during a polo match June 28. The upper fracture is mending
well but the lower fracture has shown no sign of healing, said a
palace spokesman.
   Bone from a hip joint would be packed around the fracture to
stimulate healing, the spokesman said. The surgery date was not
announced, but the spokesman said Charles was likely to be
hospitalized for a week to 10 days.
   An official visit to Brazil in October with Princess Diana was
postponed, said the spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Charles is vacationing in Scotland.
   ``It is impossible to predict at this stage whether he will play
polo again,'' the palace spokesman said.

   Gunmen shot to death two Mormon
missionaries in Peru, the church announced Thursday.
   The victims were identified by local church officials as
Peruvian nationals _ Manuel Antonio Hidalgo, 22, and Christian
Andreani Ugarte, 21.
   They were killed Wednesday on the outskirts of Huancayo, 120
miles east of Lima, as they were going to the home of church
members for lunch, according to a statement from the church's world
headquarters.
   An unspecified number of gunmen got out of a car and shot the
pair with pistols. The church said it had received its information
from Juan Angel Alvaradejo, president of the Peru Lima East Mission.
   It was the second time in 15 months that a pair of Mormon
missionaries has been killed in Latin America. On May 24, 1989, two
men were gunned down as they returned to their apartment in La Paz,
Bolivia.
   More than a dozen suspected acts of terrorism _ mostly bombings
_ have been committed against the church's chapels and missionaries
in recent years in Chile, Peru, Venezuela, Bolivia, the Dominican
Republic and Ecuador.
   ``They and their fellow missionaries are sent into the world
solely to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ and have no political
agenda or association of any kind,'' the statement said.
   Officials of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
said they were taking ``every precaution'' to ensure the safety of
other missionaries in the faith's five Peruvian missions. The
church has more than 40,000 full-time missionaries throughout the
world.
   Spokesman Don LeFevre said missionaries had been advised to
``stay in their quarters for a time until they determine if it's
safe to leave. That's just normal, if there's trouble in an area,
to tell them to stay off the streets.''

<HEAD>Gallup Poll: Race Important in Choosing School</HEAD>

   The racial and ethnic makeup of the student
body would be a key consideration for parents _ particularly
minority parents _ if they could choose which public school their
children would attend, according to a Gallup Poll released Thursday.
   The poll, conducted with the professional education fraternity
Phi Delta Kappa, also found a high level of support for a Bush
administration-backed plan to have parents choose where their
children attend public school.
   Forty-eight percent of the 1,594 adults interviewed in April and
May said student body's racial or ethnic composition would be
either a ``very'' or ``fairly important'' consideration in making a
decision. By race, 45 percent of the white parents and 67 percent
of the minority parents would consider those factors.
   Overall, 34 percent said race and ethnic composition were ``not
too important,'' 15 percent said they were ``not important at all''
and 3 percent didn't know.
   ``What this is saying is that race and ethnic makeup are
important factors,'' said Alec Gallup, co-chairman of The Gallup
Organization Inc.
   ``This whole thing is disturbing,'' he said. ``It's very hard to
interpret the non-white response. It's certainly a figure we want
to track.''
   In interpreting such data, the poll noted distinctions must be
made between public opinion and private sentiment _ in other words,
what people will tell pollsters publicly may differ from the
beliefs and biases they may be too embarrassed to disclose.
   ``It is possible that racial and ethnic considerations are much
more important factors in school choice than people admit to
pollsters,'' the study said.
   On the issue of allowing parents to choose where their children
attend public school, 62 percent of those polled favored parental
choice while 31 percent were opposed. By race, 72 percent of the
non-whites favored choice while 60 percent of the whites favored
the plan.
   Minnesota, Arkansas and Iowa have begun experiments with
parental choice, even though critics say it will mean a return to
schools segregated by race, nationality and social status.
   In other findings, the poll showed:
   _The percentage of the public believing that salaries for
teachers are too low increased from 33 percent to 50 percent in the
period between 1985 and 1990.
   _51 percent believe that raising teacher salaries would increase
the quality of education in schools either a great deal or a fair
amount.
   _16 percent place the blame for the problems confronting the
public schools on the performance of the schools, while 73 percent
place the blame on societal problems.
   This was the first year the poll asked what aspects of a public
school would be most influential in decision-making should parental
choice be adopted.
   At least three-fourths of those polled said teacher quality,
student discipline and the curriculum would influence parents'
choices the most.
   Class size, the track record of graduates in college or on the
job, school size and proximity to the student's home were highly
rated by large majorities _ ranging from 88 percent to 74 percent
for the different factors.
   The social and economic background of the student body would be
considered by 59 percent, the poll showed.
   The poll found that Americans rate the use of drugs as the
biggest problem facing the public schools and 81 percent assigned
the highest priority to freeing every school in America from drugs
and violence and offering a disciplined environment conducive to
learning.

<TEXT>
   Tuberculosis kills more than 2.5 million people
each year in developing countries, largely because they can't
afford treatment, U.S. health officials said Thursday.
   Applying TB rates and population figures, the Centers for
Disease Control estimated that 7.1 million new cases occur each
year in developing countries, including 5.1 million in East and
South Asia and 1.2 million in sub-Saharan Africa. West Asia, North
Africa and Central and South America account for 860,000.
   More than a third of those patients will die, largely because of
poor treatment or no treatment, the CDC said in its weekly report.
The estimated number of deaths from TB in the Third World is more
than 2.5 million, the Atlanta-based agency said.
   ``With the possible exception of measles, more persons in
developing countries die from TB each year than from any other
pathogen,'' the CDC said. ``Existing diagnostic technology and
chemotherapeutic agents can prevent ... TB in these countries.''
   Tuberculosis, a contagious bacterial infection of the lungs, can
be cured in most cases with antibiotic drug treatment.
   ``The most effective means of reducing transmission of
tuberculosis infection, and thus the number of TB cases, is to
treat and cure patients,'' the CDC said.
   But treatment often doesn't reach patients in poorer countries.
   ``It's a combination of things, but clearly, it's money and
resources,'' said Dr. Christopher Murray, lead researcher for the
CDC report and a research fellow at the Center for Population
Studies at the Harvard School of Public Health.
   ``The cost of treating everybody that's untreated has been
variously estimated at more than $700 million a year,'' he said.
The average cost of treatment is more than $300 per patient cured.
   While cases and deaths from TB have decreased in most developed
countries since the 1940s and the advent of antibiotics, ``TB
remains a major problem'' in developing countries, the CDC said.
   In sub-Saharan Africa, the average person stands a 2 percent
chance of getting TB in any given year. By comparison, the average
resident of the Netherlands runs a TB risk of 0.01 percent,
Thursday's report said.
   A similar but separate CDC study for the United States has
placed the U.S. risk at 0.009 percent, close to the Netherlands'
figure.
   Until recent years, ``there's been a great deal of pessimism
about the possibility of high cure rates'' for TB in poor
countries, Murray said. In most developing countries, fewer than
half the patients who started treatment were cured, in large part
because the treatment routine can take a year or so.
   But ``short-course'' drug treatment efforts in the 1980s have
achieved cure rates of 80-90 percent, he said.
   ``That's been a major gain,'' Murray said. ``With well-organized
programs with careful follow-up, primarily using short-course
chemotherapy, the time you need to maintain (patient) compliance is
less, and compliance is the basic issue.''
   Most people carrying TB infections will never become ill. In the
United States, CDC researchers estimate 10 million people are
infected, but only about 22,000 new cases are reported each year.
TB kills about 1,700 people a year in this country.

   Bill Cosby is wearing his competition on his
sleeve, a T-shirt to be exact, after posing for a magazine cover
wearing a shirt with Bart Simpson on it declaring, ``Yo, Bill!''
   TV's top pop was preparing to battle the smart-aleck Bart
Simpson after Fox TV moved its runaway hit, ``The Simpsons,'' from
Sunday nights to a Thursday night time slot, pitted against NBC's
``The Cosby Show.''
   Cosby said he's been changing ``The Cosby Show,'' re-energizing
it with nine new writers, as a matter of principle.
   ``I'm working harder and enjoying it more. And whether the
audience is there in the numbers or not, I am proud of what we've
done,'' Cosby said.
   ``All of the changes were made B.B. _ Before Bart,'' Cosby told
Entertainment Weekly in an interview being published next week. The
magazine cover features Cosby wearing the Bart T-shirt.
   ``We're hoping to establish a little bit of a foothold here,''
Fox Entertainment President Peter Cherin said recently.
   ``We're taking it as a very serious challenge,'' countered NBC
Entertainment Chairman Brandon Tartikoff.
   The shows were programmed head-to-head for the first time
Thursday night, although both were reruns. ``The Cosby Show''
starts its new shows in September, a full month before Fox will
have new offerings of ``The Simpsons.''
   Not surprisingly, Cosby was critical of his animated, bewildered
competitors.
   ``The mean-spirited and cruel think this is `the edge,' and
their excuse is, that's the way people are today. But why should we
be entertained by that?'' he asked.
   ``TV should be moving in a direction from the Huxtables forward,
not backward.''

<HEAD>Court: Beard Ban Not Discriminatory Against Orthodox Jews</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arizona's ban on prisoners wearing beards
does not discriminate against Orthodox Jews, a federal appeals
court ruled.
   In a 3-0 decision, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said
Wednesday the December 1988 grooming policy of the Arizona
Department of Corrections was a legitimate means of ``aiding rapid
and accurate identification.''
   The policy allowed mustaches but prohibited beards except for
medical reasons. It was challenged by two prisoners, Kenneth Andrew
Friedman and Arnold Naftiel, who said their religious beliefs
prohibited them from shaving their beards.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Broomfield ruled in the state's favor
and was upheld by the appeals court. The court cited testimony by
J.C. Kenney, then supervisor of Arizona's prisons, that the
no-beard policy helped identify prisoners in riots and escapes, as
well as day-to-day activities that required identification.
   The appeals court said Kenney's testimony established that the
policy served ``legitimate penological interests,'' which would be
harmed if the prisoners' rights were protected. That is the
standard the state must meet to justify taking away prisoners'
constitutional rights, under a 1987 Supreme Court ruling.
   The opinion by Judge Thomas Tang said the high court allows
prison officials to anticipate security problems, rather than
having to justify their policies with evidence from past incidents.
   Tang also said Friedman and Naftiel had testified that they
could practice their religion in other ways. For example, the
prison provided them with at least one kosher TV dinner a day.
   Friedman, 32, is serving a 15-year sentence for sexual assault.
Naftiel, 36, is serving 25 years for assault and kidnapping.

   The five permanent Security Council
members today reached a tentative agreement on a resolution
authorizing the use of ``minimum force'' to halt all maritime
commerce with Iraq, the U.S. ambassador said.
   ``We agreed on a text to send to capitals, and we will continue
our consultations this afternoon,'' said the ambassador, Thomas. R.
Pickering, who has been lobbying for the proposal for several days.
   He spoke after another informal meeting with envoys from the
Soviet Union, Britain, China and France. He has said he hoped for
an early Security Council meeting to vote on the draft, but there
were no immediate plans for a meeting.
   Western diplomats described the move as progress, but not a
breakthrough and said much depends on views of the envoys'
governments.
   Approval, or agreement not to veto the resolution, would be
required from the governments of the five permanent members before
the United States would call a meeting, diplomats said.
   The United States has been pressing for council approval for the
use of force to police and enforce the council's sweeping economic
embargo against Iraq. The embargo was imposed Aug. 6 to punish Iraq
for invading Kuwait.
   The Soviets and Chinese have been reluctant to let the Security
Council sanction the use of military force by the U.S.-led
multinational fleet assembling in the Persian Gulf to defend Saudi
Arabia.
   However, sources in the State Department say the Soviets have
not threatened to veto such a resolution. On Wednesday, a Kuwaiti
official visiting in Beijing said China gave assurances it would
not veto a blockade embargo.
   Meanwhile, two senior U.N. officials sent to Baghdad wrapped up
three days of meetings with top Iraqi officials on the plight of
the 2 million foreigners caught in Iraq and Kuwait by the Aug. 2
invasion of the emirate.
   Iraq's foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, assured Virendra Dayal and
Kofi Annan on Wednesday that foreigners were being well treated but
declined to give further information on the foreigners. Some
Americans and Britons have been taken to Iraqi installations to
serve as human shields to U.S. attack.
   ``They are the guests of the Iraqi people,'' the Iraqi News
Agency quoted Aziz as saying. However, Aziz also told the envoys
that the United Nations has become ``a tool'' of American policy in
the Persian Gulf crisis.
   In Tokyo, a Japanese official said his government has decided to
send aid to Jordan, whose economy is squeezed by the embargo as
well as a crush of tens of thousands of refugees from Iraq and
Kuwait.
   As the economic embargo that the Security Council imposed on
Iraq tightens, it is having unintended effects on some of Iraq's
major trade partners. Jordan and Bulgaria told the Security Council
the embargo is crushing their economies.
   Jordan, which has been inundated with more than 185,000 refugees
from neighboring Iraq since Iraqi President Saddam Hussein launched
the invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, won the sympathy of the Security
Council on Wednesday.
   The council held an urgent private meeting that concluded just
before midnight, and decided Jordan was ``a very important and
difficult case, and they had to have help,'' said the British
ambassador, Sir Crispin Tickell.
   Diplomats said no particular figures or goals were discussed.
The Security Council decided to begin drafting a resolution calling
on all U.N. members to give Jordan additional bilateral aid.
   Despite Jordan's policy of allowing food and supplies to be
trucked from its port of Aqaba to Baghdad, ``We all agreed that
Jordan was an exceptional case and they needed particular help, and
no voice was raised to say that would not be done,'' said Tickell.

<TEXT>
   Jurors who watched a 72-minute videotape of a
brutal sexual attack decided Thursday that the rapist should spend
life in prison.
   They handed down the sentence against 30-year-old Timothy Kehoe
after convicting him of aggravated sexual assault a day earlier. He
appeared to wipe away a tear when State District Judge Larry Baraka
affirmed the sentence.
   The victim said she felt vindicated by the life term.
   Jurors cringed Tuesday as they watched the videotape,
confiscated by police from Kehoe's North Dallas apartment. The tape
showed Kehoe beating the woman into submission and forcing her to
perform various sex acts. She pleaded with Kehoe 22 times to stop
the assault.
   Authorities said they believe it's the first time a Dallas
County jury has watched a videotape of a rape.
   ``He had the gall to videotape this event because it was a big
event in his life and he wanted to savor it,'' Assistant District
Attorney Janet Wright told jurors.
   She termed the defense's argument that the woman consented to
have sex with Kehoe ``ludicrous.''
   The woman told police that she met Kehoe April 28 at a bar and
agreed to accompany him to his apartment to see his motorcycle.
   The woman told police that Kehoe persuaded her to enter the
house then ordered her to take ``an unknown white pill.'' He then
set up a videotape camera in the bedroom, the woman testified.
   When she tried to run, Kehoe punched her several times in the
face, then repeatedly raped her. She said she finally escaped when
another man knocked at the front door and Kehoe went to answer it.
   The woman said she called police several hours later and gave
them Kehoe's address.
   During the punishment phase of his trial Wednesday, Kehoe
tearfully apologized to the woman.
   ``I wish I could take the pain away that I caused her,'' Kehoe
said.

   Food and Drug Administration scientists on
Thursday documented their belief that a synthetic hormone designed
to increase milk production in cows poses no health risk to
consumers.
   In an unprecedented move, the FDA released its review of more
than 120 studies to support its previous statements that milk and
meat from dairy cows treated with the hormone, which is still not
approved, are safe.
   ``We have concluded that the food products derived from treated
animals are safe for human consumption,'' said Richard Teske,
deputy director of the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine.
   Publication of the review in this week's edition of the journal
Science was ``a response to congressional and public interest''
over the safety of the hormone, bovine somatotropin or bST, said
FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit.
   Some consumer activists say long-term effects of the
genetically-engineered hormone are still not known, and farmers
worry that consumers might shy away from products from treated
cows. Farmers also are concerned that increased milk production
would lower prices.
   Earlier this week, the Journal of the American Medical
Association published the work of two researchers who concluded
that bST can boost milk production in dairy cows by 10 percent to
25 percent while causing no significant changes in composition of
the milk. Also, JAMA published an editorial by an independent
researcher backing the conclusions.
   The FDA has not approved bST for commercial use, but the agency
has allowed four companies to run limited farm tests of their
products and to sell the milk from the test cows.
   Also, the FDA is still reviewing studies on the health effects
of bST on cows, which must be shown before it can be approved.
   ``We don't anticipate that we'll even complete the review
process any earlier than the spring of 1991,'' Teske said.
   If approved, synthetic bST would become the first major
biotechnology product on the agriculture market.
   Two major milk-producing states _ Minnesota and Wisconsin _ have
imposed temporary bans on use of bST and other states are
considering similar action.
   Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Foundation on Economic Trends,
called the JAMA article ``shameful'' because the article's two
authors are consultants to Monsanto, one of the four companies
testing bST.
   The FDA article was ``irresponsible'' because the agency
scientists relied heavily on old studies that tested with natural
bST rather than the synthetic hormone, he said.
   ``There are a lot of unanswered questions,'' Rifkin said. ``The
FDA is trying to push this product through without doing their
homework.''
   The General Accounting Office, at the request of Sen. Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, is
reviewing the FDA's assessment of bST risks.
   His concern stems in part from a former FDA veterinarian who
said he was fired after he alleged that testing of bST was flawed.
   The FDA article _ written by Judith C. Juskevich, formerly with
the agency's Center for Veterinary Medicine and now an FDA
consultant, and C. Greg Guyer, a chemist in the center's Office of
New Animal Drug Evaluation _ says data from the studies show that
bST is harmless when consumed orally because it breaks down during
digestion.
   The agency's scientists also said the data show that 90 percent
of bST in milk is destroyed during pasteurization, and that milk
from treated cows would have synthetic bST residues within the
normal range of the naturally occurring bST.
   The public controversy over bST is unusual because the FDA does
not normally discuss the merits of products before they are
approved.
   In this case, however, the FDA got permission from the four
companies making the hormone _ Monsanto Agriculture Co., Eli Lilly
Co., Upjohn Co. and American Cyanamid _ to seek a third-party
review ``to make sure it (the FDA's review) was done properly,''
Teske said.
   As with all reports published in Science, the FDA report first
was reviewed by a panel of expert scientists.

<HEAD>Two Arrested in Bombings of Three Banks</HEAD>

   Two men have been charged in connection with
three bank bombings this summer in Riverside County that caused $3
million in damage.
   In each case, a bomb exploded in a night deposit box early on a
Monday morning. No one was injured.
   Lorenz Vilim Karlic, 33, of Hesperia, and Rodney Burl Smith, 34,
of Mentone, were ordered jailed without bail by U.S. Magistrate
George L. Martin, FBI spokesman Fred Reagan said Wednesday.
   Each was charged with one count of destroying a federally
insured bank with an explosive device, FBI special Agent Lawrence
G. Lawler said.
   The charge stems from a June 11 bombing and fire that leveled a
Security Pacific National Bank branch in Indio. FBI officials said
they expected to file additional charges in connection with two
earlier bombings.
   Karlic was arrested in Claremont on Aug. 19 after an officer saw
him acting suspiciously in a high crime area, Lawler said.
   Smith was arrested by FBI and Secret Service agents Wednesday in
San Bernardino.
   Lawler said authorities found counterfeit money and items
related to the bombings at the locations where the men were
arrested.
   The most recent bombing, on June 11, destroyed the Security
Pacific branch in Indio, about 130 miles southeast of Los Angeles.
   On May 21, a night deposit box was bombed in nearby Rancho
Mirage, causing extensive damage to the Provident Federal Savings
Bank branch, authorities said.
   On May 7, a small fire erupted after an explosion at a Bank of
America branch in Palm Springs. The explosion threw the deposit
box's door 500 feet and damaged the bank wall.

<HEAD>US Says Soviet Military Advisers in Iraq May Violate UN Sanctions</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Gulf-Bush, Bjt</HEAD>

   The Bush administration scolded the Soviet
Union on Thursday for keeping military advisers in Iraq and
suggested Moscow may be in violation of United Nations sanctions
against President Saddam Hussein.
   ``It is inappropriate to provide any form of military assistance
to Iraq,'' State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said. ``We
believe U.N. sanctions extend to the provision of services to
Iraq.''
   The statement jarred an otherwise smooth approach taken by
Washington and Moscow in the Persian Gulf crisis. Together the two
superpowers are trying to force Saddam to relinquish control of
Kuwait by denying Iraq all economic necessities.
   Through diplomatic channels, however, the State Department has
registered its concerns to Moscow about keeping military advisers
in Iraq, although U.S. officials told The Associated Press there
was no evidence the Soviets helped on the battlefield.
   The issue flared publicly Wednesday after a Soviet colonel told
reporters in Moscow that 193 military advisers were finishing their
``contractual obligations'' to the Soviets.
   U.S. officials said privately the figure may be even larger.
   ``Obviously we have differences with the Soviets when it comes
to advisers,'' an official said Thursday. ``Differences arise even
with the best of allies. In fact, the British and Canadians raised
questions about our trying to enforce the sanctions with a military
blockade.''
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
disagreement with the Soviets was one of interpreting the sanctions
imposed Aug. 6 by the United Nations Security Council with Soviet
support.
   ``We have a common concern with the Soviets about the safety of
foreign nationals in Iraq and Kuwait, and we are working together
on that,'' he said.
   The statement read by Boucher stopped short of declaring the
Soviets in violation of the sanctions. ``We lack sufficient
information about the precise basis under which Soviet advisers are
in Iraq to render a definitive judgment,'' he said.
   The Soviets, once a primary source of weapons for Iraq, agreed
to cut off shipments in compliance with the sanctions. Boucher said
there is no reason to suspect Moscow is still arming Iraq.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III spoke by telephone
Wednesday from his ranch in Wyoming with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze. U.S. officials said they discussed the
timing of moves in the United Nations to enforce the sanctions.
   The two superpowers exchanged messages on Thursday, but Boucher
declined to divulge the details.

   Thousands of foreigners poured through
this desert post Thursday after Jordanian authorities delayed
closing the border to cope with an exodus of refugees from Iraq and
Kuwait.
   A senior security official said 5,000 people, mostly Egyptians,
crossed into Jordan and 15,000 Arabs and Asians were expected to
pass through before the end of the day.
   ``I'm happy that I got out of Iraq and I'm safe in Jordan,''
said Mohammed Iismail, an Egyptian laborer who has lived in Iraq
for seven years. ```Despite all the pain that we went through
during this long journey, I feel fine and happy that I'm finally
going home to see my family.''
   The Interior Ministry said Wednesday it was closing the desert
crossing temporarily to ease congestion caused by the wave of
people that followed Iraq's Aug. 2 invastion of neighboring Kuwait.
   The security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the ministry rescinded the order Thursday ``to relieve the
congestion on the Iraqi side.'' Officials planned to close the
border Friday.
   ``This is a humanitarian situation and we're doing our utmost to
let these people cross in an orderly manner and without any
restrictions,'' he told The Associated Press.
   To reach the border, foreigners had to make their way in
suffocating heat across the desert from Baghdad, 590 miles to the
west.
   About 16,000 refugees allowed into Jordan on Wednesday were
stranded at the border, 204 miles northeast of Amman, Jordan's
capital. They camped in army tents and sought shade around
government offices as the temperature soared to 110 degrees.
   Border guards distributed food and water to the listless
refugees, slumped among their bundles. Officials crammed in small
rooms processed the endless stream of refugees.
   ``I had to cut my honeymoon short because of this,'' lamented
Sgt. Aahmad al-Aawamleh. ``I just got married last week.''
   The 23-year-old police officer was helping a group of Egyptians
carry their baggage to a tent, which sheltered people from the sun.
   The decision to close the border came after King Hussein
complained at a news conference Wednesday that Jordan simply could
not cope with the human flood. On Wednesday, 42,000 evacuees,
mostly Arabs and Asians, arrived in Jordan, the biggest one-day
border crossing since the crisis erupted.
   Interior Minister Salem Massadeh said the move was made because
of ``concern for the health situation of the arrivals and to ensure
suitable arrangements for their stay in Jordan.''
   Hussein said 185,000 foreigners, mostly Arabs, have poured into
Jordan since the crisis flared. Only 67,000 have left the country
for other destinations.
   Those who remained in Jordan, gripped by severe economic woes,
have put heavy strains on the country's transportation and social
services.
   ``We're encountering enormous difficulties in meeting the needs
of these people,'' the king said Wednesday.
   Authorities reported that 25,000 refugees, mainly Egyptians who
have been jamming Aqaba for days, were thinning out after Cairo
sent aircraft for the second day to ferry its nationals out.
   Egyptian Ambassador Mahab Muqbel said Thursday that in the past
24 hours, 20 airliners carried 4,368 Egyptians and 473 Sudanese out
of Aqaba, a Red Sea port city. Muqbel said that Cairo will send in
one plane an hour to the port to pick up the stranded Egyptians.
   In Amman, an Iraqi Airways jetliner landed Thursday morning at
Queen Alia International Airport carrying 163 people, including a
Briton, six Canadians and a Swede, officials reported.
   Airport officials said 144 passengers aboard the Iraqi plane
were of Arab origin, mostly Jordanians. Three were Czechoslovaks
and eight were Japanese.
   Officials said Iraqi Airways will continue one flight a day to
Amman since the Jordanian order to stem the flow of refugees did
not apply to air travel.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported that
48,000 refugees had crossed Iraq into Iran since Sunday. Most
crossed at the southern town of Shalamcheh, scene of fierce
fighting in the closing stages of the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. The
agency said eight Iranians had died from the heat on their way
across the desert. It gave no details.

   Threats from Saddam Hussein will not deter the
United States from defending its interests in the Middle East, the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said Thursday.
   ``Don't try to scare us or threaten us,'' Gen. Colin L. Powell
said in a speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars national
convention. ``It won't work, never has . . .
   ``We love peace. But we know that it is better to obtain peace
by standing up to aggression early so you don't have to fight a
war.''
   Powell said the United States will not abandon Americans being
held in Kuwait and Iraq.
   ``We will always come to the aid of our friends and our fellow
citizens. We will not abandon them when they are hostages,'' he
said. ``No Iraqi leader should think for a moment that we don't
have the will or the ability to accomplish what might be required
of us.''
   A look at 20th-century U.S. history will give any Iraqi leader
``all the proof he needs of the strength of our arms and our
fighting ability,'' he said.
   ``Mr. Hussein, the solution to the crisis is simple. Leave
Kuwait. Let the legitimate government return. Use your wealth for
peace, not war,'' he said.
   Powell called the invasion of Kuwait a forceful reminder of the
need for a strong America.
   ``In the past three weeks, we haven't heard much of perestroika
or glasnost or a reunified Germany or market economies in communist
countries,'' he said.
   The invasion of Kuwait proves that the world needs a strong
leader, and the United States is the only superpower that can fill
that role, Powell said.
   ``We cannot shrink from it,'' he said.
   Powell praised Soviet leaders for working with the U.S. to stem
the crisis in the Middle East.
   But he said the United States must not forget that the Soviet
Union remains ``a nuclear military superpower with the ability, if
not the intention, to destroy our way of life in 30 minutes.''

   David Burke, CBS News' fifth president in five
years, was out Thursday and Eric W. Ober in as his successor as the
once-troubled division was back in the headlines after two years of
relative calm.
   One CBS source characterized the reason for Burke's departure as
a ``leadership issue'' and not arguments over budget with the
cost-cutting president of CBS Inc., Laurence A. Tisch.
   Burke, 54, a former ABC News executive vice president who CBS
hired in August 1988, did not return phone calls. But he strongly
hinted in a statement that he'd been forced out.
   ``It is clear to me, following amicable discussions of with the
management of CBS, that they would be more comfortable about the
future of the news division under new leadership.
   ``They have the right to make that decision,'' he said, pledging
to help his 48-year-old successor, Ober. The latter has spent 24
years at CBS, including stints in CBS News. He currently heads CBS'
television stations division.
   ``I'm not walking in there with any mandate or any plans for a
change,'' Ober said in a brief interview. ``I've had no discussions
about cost-cutting or anything else. The priority over there (at
CBS headquarters) is to let them do their jobs.''
   Burke's hiring was preceded by six years of turmoil that
included Gen. William C. Westmoreland's $120 million libel suit
over a Vietnam documentary, and low morale caused by staff cuts,
the largest of them occuring in March 1987, when more than 200
employees were fired. Westmoreland dropped the lawsuit after weeks
of a costly trial for both sides.
   When Burke arrived, he clamped down on what had been a plethora
of leaks by staffers about the woes of CBS News.
   He also generally refused to grant interviews to reporters, even
about such controversies as his three-month suspension of ``60
Minutes'' humorist Andy Rooney.
   The suspension, announced in February, came after a gay magazine
quoted Rooney as making a racial slur that the humorist denied
saying. Burke ended the suspension three weeks later, but again
refused to talk to reporters about the matter.
   But since Burke's arrival, CBS News had stabilized. It scored
successes last year with its coverage of the student uprising in
China, and this summer with its coverage of the Persian Gulf crisis.
   And while the ``CBS This Morning'' remains a distant third in
ratings, Dan Rather's once-dominant ``CBS Evening News,'' after a
sharp ratings decline, at least had become a respectable second to
ABC's ``World News Tonight.''
   Still, said one CBS executive who spoke on condition of
anonymity, Burke's downfall was due in part to his reclusive
management style and tendency to stay cooped up his office.
   ``It was a broad question of leadership, a question of where CBS
News was going,'' the executive said. The news division ``has got
to be a collegial enterprise of very creative people, and it needs
a very open leader who involves people in decision-making and
consultation.''
   After reviewing Burke's way of doing things, he said, ``our
sense was that we're just not comfortable that that's the right way
to lead a news divsion.''
   Burke had two years to go on his contract when he left.
   CBS Broadcast Group president Howard Stringer, who preceded
Burke as president, declined to comment on what part Burke's
management style played in the change at the news division.
   Rooney of ``60 Minutes'' said he knew little about why Burke got
the gate, but ``I refuse to take any pleasure from it, because as
as far as I know he was doing a satisfactory job. ... I don't think
he handled my suspension well, but that's not reason enough to fire
him.''
   Since 1980, there have been six presidents at CBS News,
including two tours by Stringer's predecessor, Van Gordon Sauter,
now a TV producer in Los Angeles.
   Richard S. Salant, who earlier was twice president of CBS News
and held the job for a now-incredible total of 16 years, said he
liked Burke and didn't know what caused the departure.
   Salant left CBS in 1979 upon reaching the mandatory retirement
age of 65. He was philosophical about those now running the company:
   ``They can't seem to find a (news) president who will stay or
that they want to stay put.''

   Japanese leadership in semiconductor technology _
key to missile targeting _ helped promote the Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty talks between the United States and the Soviet
Union, a Japanese politician claims.
   ``There was more motivation to come to agreement when these
countries were no longer capable of making advances without the
help of a third country,'' Shintaro Ishihara said in an interview
in the October issue of Playboy magazine.
   ``And nothing can be sweeter revenge for us than this: the one
country that has been bombed by nuclear weapons is in a position of
having a great effect on the reduction of their availability and
maybe their use,'' Ishihara said. ``Isn't that the most
sophisticated kind of revenge?''
   Ishihara, 57, a film maker, prolific and award-winning writer
and an outspoken member of the Japanese parliament, said Japan is
five years ahead of the United States in semiconductor technology
``and the gap is widening.''
   He said chips with a capacity of 1 and 2 megabits, ``which are
key to targeting ICBMs _ are not made in America, at least not with
consistent quality,'' he said.
   Ishihara, who is considering running for prime minister of
Japan, has been a target of Pentagon and congressional scrutiny for
his contributions to the book ``The Japan That Can Say No.''
   The collection of speeches by Ishihara and by Sony Corp.
chairman Akio Morita has sold more than a million copies in Japan,
but has been attacked in this country as an example of
America-bashing.
   Ishihara told Playboy that a Pentagon translation of the book,
which has not been officially published in this country, contains
misinterpretations and distortions.
   ``I plan to publish an accurate, formal version, which is now
being prepared. At that time I plan to sue the Pentagon over the
illegal translation,'' he said.
   The book has also come to the attention of Chrysler Corp.
chairman Lee Iaccoca, who has said the Ishihara's and Morita's
``arrogance pours salt into an already open wound.'' Ishihara said
in the interview that Iaccoca used Japan as a scapegoat for his own
inadequacies as an industrialist.
   Ishihara said his basic message is that Japan has become the
second most powerful nation on earth, and the U.S.-Japanese
relationship needs readjustment.
   ``America has 10 times more kinds of basic research in
state-of-the-art technology than Japan does. That's not going to
change. What Japan has is the industrial dynamism it takes to make
useful, quality products. That ability has disappeared from
American industry,'' he said.
   ``So think about what each of us does best: America and Japan
could, working together, make a new civilization for the entire
world,'' he said.

   The U.S. Navy has boarded ``a handful'' of
ships in its week-old effort to halt Iraqi shipping, the Pentagon
said Thursday.
   Spokesman Pete Williams, asked to be more specific, said ``a
handful would have to be less than 10.'' He said he could not give
a definitive number nor say when or where the boardings occurred.
   In recent days, the United States has been urging swift approval
of a U.N. resolution allowing military force to support the
international body's sanctions against Iraq over its invasion of
Kuwait, but the Soviet Union has been counseling that caution be
used before military force is applied.
   At a Pentagon briefing, Williams said he was not aware of any
more shots having been fired, but said ``dozens'' of ships were
involved in the interdiction operations.
   ``We continue to monitor ships,'' Williams said.
   Ships belonging to the two aircraft carrier battle groups in the
Red Sea, one carrier battle group in the Gulf of Oman and the ships
of the Middle East Task Force in the Persian Gulf are involved in
the operation.
   Boarding parties have been issued shotguns, pistols and
specialized instructions on how to board and search vessels
suspected of carrying cargo bound to or from Iraq.
   The sailors carry plastic cards in French, Arabic and English
telling the ships' crews to remain calm and that no harm will come
to them if they cooperate with the U.S. boarding parties.
   Williams said there was a ``high degree of voluntary
compliance'' with the effort, and that ``many ships have turned
back.'' Again, he said he had no specific number.
   Williams said the two Iraqi tankers involved in Saturday's
shooting incident _ the first of the operation _ were ``still being
shadowed'' by U.S. Navy ships.
   The fast frigate USS Reid fired six warning shots across the bow
of the Iraqi-flagged vessel Khanaqin in the Gulf of Oman after it
refused repeated requests to halt. In a separate incident, the USS
Bradley fired three warning shots across the bow of another Iraqi
tanker.
   The Khanaqin unloaded ``a portion of its cargo'' in Aden, Yemen,
on Tuesday and has left port, Williams said.
   ``The Yemenis have assured the United Sates that the off-loading
stopped before it was completed,'' the spokesman said.
   Williams referred reporters to the State Department when they
asked whether it had been determined that the cargo involved items
that would break the U.N.-sanctioned embargo against Iraq.
   Asked whether any other ships had been challenged and had sailed
on, Williams replied: ``Not that I know of.''

   A teen-ager who said repeated viewings of the
violent film ``A Clockwork Orange'' led him to fatally stab and
strangle a friend was sentenced Thursday to life in prison without
chance of parole.
   Michale Anderson of Pittsburgh, who turned 18 Thursday, was
convicted June 21 of first-degree murder in the slaying of
17-year-old Karen Hurwitz. She died in her back yard Oct. 27, 1989,
after being strangled and stabbed six times in the chest with a
36-inch martial arts sword.
   Before sentencing Anderson, Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge
Robert E. Dauer told him that murder is the ``most horrendous of
crimes.''
   ``Your crime is even worse. You killed somebody you liked,
indeed, loved,'' he said.
   Anderson read a statement in which he apologized to the slain
girl's parents.
   ``I'm sorry for the sorrow I have wrought upon you,'' he said.
``I ask you to see me for what I am and not for what I have done.''
   Anderson said ``the whole truth'' has not come out about the
killing. He indicated lawyers and the news media have muddled the
facts, but did not elaborate.
   ``No matter what, you must know the truth,'' Anderson said. ``I
will tell you the truth, eventually, as it was recorded in my mind
forever.''
   In a confession to police, Anderson said he ``always did bad
things'' when he wore his black ``A Clockwork Orange'' T-shirt. He
was wearing the shirt when he stabbed Miss Hurwitz, a high school
senior.
   Anderson's attorney, Jon Botula, said during the two-day trial
that his client was incited to kill by repeated viewings of the
1971 film, which starred Malcolm McDowell as the leader of a group
of hooligans.
   The movie chronicled the marauders' ``ultraviolence'' _ similar
to recent ``wilding'' episodes in New York _ and a futuristic
society's efforts to control the youths.
   Botula showed jurors a 50-minute clip of the Stanley Kubrick
film, based on the Anthony Burgess novel of the same name.
   The murdered girl's mother, Linda Hurwitz, said after the
conviction that she recalled watching the movie while pregnant with
her daughter.
   ``I remember walking out afterwards so shaken, saying to myself,
`I hope I'm not bringing my child into a world with these kinds of
people, without any feeling or any emotion _ just plain brutality,'
'' she said.
   The prosecution rejected Anderson's contention that the movie
made him kill, and a specialist in media psychology suggested the
movie was used by Botula as a scapegoat.
   ``Every couple of years, you have a not-easily-verifiable,
mystical source that causes people to do strange things,'' said
Stuart Fischoff, a professor of psychology at California State
University at Los Angeles.
   ``The defense that, `The devil made me do it' _ the devil is
either records or movies or genetics _ is not new,'' he said.
``Television and film is today's contemporary devil.''
   Life in prison without parole is the minimum penalty for
first-degree murder in Pennsylvania. Prosecutors did not ask for
the death penalty because the required aggravating circumstances
were not present.

   The local newspaper, The Enterprise, says
it will continue to publish names of arrested prostitutes and their
customers in spite of the suicide of one customer.
   A 47-year-old man from a nearby town died Friday, apparently of
carbon monoxide poisoning in his car in his garage, after a report
linking him with a prostitute was published in the newspaper.
   Police said the man left a suicide note that did not mention he
had been arrested with a prostitute and had been convicted of
sexual misconduct for a fee and fined $155 three days earlier.
   The Enterprise held to its policy of not naming suicides who
kill themselves in private.
   The newspaper has always published names of anyone arrested in
the city, except for routine traffic infractions, Paul Salters,
night city editor at The Enterprise, said Thursday.
   ``Everyone who gets arrested, gets his name in the paper,''
Salters said.
   The problem of prostitution is particularly troubling, and
deserves attention, he said.
   ``The editors of this newspaper believe that the situation is
out of hand on the streets,'' Salters said. ``These people come out
like sea gulls at a town dump at night. It's just everywhere. It is
so bad, residents of the city try to avoid driving through the
downtown at night.''
   Executive editor Bruce Smith said the practice of publishing
names of customers started earlier this month after Police Chief
Robert J. DiCarli announced a crackdown and asked the newspaper to
help by listing the names and addresses of both prostitutes and
their customers.
   ``I don't think there has been any direct link between the fact
that his name was published and the suicide,'' he said.
   Detective Arthur McClaren said police and the newspaper were
``getting hassled'' on radio and television talk shows.
   ``People are saying, `His name was put in the paper. That's why
he committed suicide.' But the girls' names have always gone in.
Why not print the males' and the girls'?''
   Smith said he thinks The Enterprise is performing a public
service that has helped cut down on solicitation in the city of
about 97,000 residents.
   ``Other cities have the same problem, and they have
crackdowns,'' said George R. Cataldo, assistant to Mayor Carl
Pitaro.
   ``Here, business people were complaining. They felt prostitution
was taking business away from the downtown area. As far as putting
the names of johns and the girls in the paper, it's embarrassing in
one respect, but it has been a deterrent.''
   Louis Hodges, director of Society and the Professions, an ethics
program at Washington and Lee University, said the media should not
collaborate with police and the names should not be published.
   ``I don't think it is right for a newspaper to agree to publish
the names at the request of police,'' he said. ``You can get
yourself locked in in ways that are wrong.
   ``Secondly, newspapers have no business inflicting additional
harm. So the names ought not to be published at all, even upon
conviction.''
   William Kovach, curator of the Nieman Foundation at Harvard
University, said: ``The fact that the police requested that names
and addresses be published does not automatically make the
newspaper a part of the police apparatus. ...
   ``The first question the editor must address is whether or not
prostitution is so important in that community that people should
be exposed to the notoriety,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A hospital blocked by an appellate
ruling from ending the pregnancy of a psychotic patient sought
Thursday to have the woman declared incompetent so it can perform
the abortion.
   Denise Lefebvre, 28, has been strapped to a hospital bed to keep
her from hurting herself, according to court documents. On
occasions since her July 3 hospitalization she has threatened to
kill her baby, according to the records.
   She will spend the next sixth months _ the remainder of her
pregnancy _ under restraint if the court rules the pregnancy can
continue, said her father, Joseph Lefebvre.
   Last month, Broward Circuit Judge William Clayton Johnson
granted permission to hospital officials to perform an abortion on
Lefebvre, who is 13 weeks pregnant.
   The 4th District Court of Appeal overturned the ruling on
Thursday. Before the abortion can take place, the court said,
Lefebvre must be declared incompetent. Johnson will rule on her
competency.
   ``This woman is very lucid regarding her baby,'' said assistant
public defender Frank DeLatorre, who is representing the woman.
``Everyone wanted to give the woman an abortion except her.''
   Hospital officials sought the abortion because they feared the
fetus had been damaged by Lefebvre's use of lithium, an
anti-psychotic medication known to cause birth defects.
   DeLatorre said Lefebvre had stopped taking the drug after
learning she was pregnant, but the hospital maintains she is
dangerously psychotic when not on medication.
   Hospital workers testified last month that Lefebvre ate her
excrement and wrote satanic messages with it on the walls. She
attacked nurses and shouted obscenities, they said.
   ``Her voice goes really mean and she goes, `I'm going to kill my
baby and I'm going to kill you,''' nurse Sharon Stratton testified.
   Joseph Lefebvre said he would consent to an abortion.
   ``She's not capable of taking care of a child,'' he said. ``I
don't think my daughter knows what's going on.''
   William Scherer, an attorney for Broward General Medical Center,
said the hospital would ask that the competency proceedings be
handled on an emergency basis.
   Abortion is legal in Florida until the 16th week of pregnancy.
After that, abortions can only be performed to save the mother's
life.
   Officials have not located the father of Lefebvre's child. She
says he is a man named George, who is also mentally ill.

<HEAD>Experiment Produces World's Coldest Temperature</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   University of Colorado physicists have
produced what they claim to be the world's coldest temperature _
within 1.1 millionth of a degree Celsius of absolute zero.
   That translates to 459.67 degrees below zero Fahrenheit.
   Physicist Carl Wieman, who conducted the experiment with
graduate student Chris Monroe, said it shaved 1.4-millionth of a
degree Celsius from the previous record, recently achieved by
physicists at the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris.
   Absolute zero theoretically is the temperature at which
molecular motion stops. Temperatures in space drop to about 3
degrees Celsius above absolute zero, scientists said.
   Wieman said the achievement itself was not so important, but its
advancement of understanding about the basic nature of matter and
its potential practical applications are noteworthy.
   ``I'm absolutely convinced there will be an enormous number of
applications,'' he said.
   The scientists used $200 diode lasers _ the same kind used in
compact-disc players _ to trap atoms of the metallic element cesium
in one place.
   Restricting the atoms in a cage of laser beams caused the atoms
to slow down and cool, said Wieman.
   ``The whole setup has turned out to be a very inexpensive
apparatus that's giving spectacular results,'' Wieman said. ``We
have ideas on how to make this get much colder.''
   Wieman said one practical application of the technique would be
to improve the accuracy of atomic clocks by a factor of 100. Atomic
clocks, which count the oscillations of cesium atoms, already are
the world's most accurate timepieces.
   Cooling the cesium could reduce the atomic clock's margin of
error _ now about one second every 300,000 years, said Wieman.
   Wieman said the technique could lead to development of portable
atomic clocks that could be employed in submarines, spacecraft, and
other commercial applications.

   The Middle East crisis, highlighting America's
reliance on foreign oil, is spurring renewed calls for energy
conservation, including demands Thursday that automakers build more
fuel-efficient cars.
   A group of environmentalists and alternative fuel advocates
chastised President Bush for not producing specific programs aimed
at cutting energy use and for opposing legislation that would
toughen automobile fuel efficiency requirements.
   ``While the president finally used the words `energy
conservation' as U.S. troops were on their way to the Persian Gulf,
he has so far failed to propose any significant policies to reduce
dependence on oil,'' said Christopher Flavin, an energy expert at
Worldwatch Institute.
   Automobiles guzzle more oil than anything else and increasing
their fuel efficiency would be ``the single greatest step this
country can take to reduce our dependency on oil,'' said Nancy
Hirsh, director of the Energy Conservation Coalition.
   A Senate bill, sponsored by Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., which
would require automakers to increase fleet fuel efficiency to an
average 40 miles per gallon by the end of the decade, could save
2.8 million barrels of oil a day, the environmentalists maintained.
   Automobiles fleet-wide now average about 28 mpg with only
compact models reaching efficiency levels of more than 40 mpg.
Until the recent Middle East developments once again put the
spotlight on oil prices and the potential for shortages, the Bryan
bill has been touted primarily as a way to combat global warming by
reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
   Automakers have vigorously opposed the legislation, saying it
would force them to build only small cars and prompt some motorists
to keep less fuel efficient older models years longer.
   ``Congress should not be stampeded into taking potentially
harmful actions that could boomerang on the American public,'' said
Tom Hanna, president of the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association.
   Jerry terHorst, a spokesman for Ford Motor Co., called the bill
``a panicky proposal'' that would not affect current oil
disruptions anyway because it would take a dozen years before its
impact on fuel use would take effect.
   Even before the latest Middle East crisis, the Bryan legislation
was given an even chance of being approved by the Senate this year
or possibly next. Now there is an increasing likelihood it may pass
the Senate, some environmentalists and auto industry lobbyists
agree. Environmentalists are less optimistic in the House, where
automakers are relying on Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., to keep any
auto fuel efficiency legislation bottled up in his Energy and
Commerce Committee.
   The environmental groups at a news conference called on the
White House to push for the auto fuel efficiency bill, which the
administration so far has opposed, and outline other energy
conservation measures.
   President Bush, when asked during a Wednesday news confernce at
his vacation retreat in Maine about the need to conserve energy,
responded: ``I call upon Americans to conserve.'' He provided no
specifics, but said he intended to continue using his high-speed
motorboat.
   ``I don't think we've reached the point where I want to call on
everybody in the recreation industry to shut it down or everybody
that's taking a vacation in America to shut it down,'' the
president said.
   The Energy Department for more than a year has been working on a
long-term energy policy, including conservation measures. The
program is scheduled to be announced toward the end of the year.
   Recently the department said increased oil production and
conservation can make up for most of the U.S. oil imports lost
because of the Middle East turmoil. If Americans inflated their
automobile tires to the correct pressure they could save 100,000
barrels of oil a day, the department said.
   Meanwhile, Transportation Department officials met Thursday with
an aviation industry task force to look for ways to save fuel
consumed by airliners.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, in forming the group,
asked it to review the use of energy during takeoffs, landings and
movement of the planes on the ground. He suggested that airlines,
airports and government controllers might be able to adopt
procedures that use less fuel.

   Philadelphia's Independence Hall is plagued by
a leaky roof and an equally deficient budget that has allowed area
fountains and walkways to fall into disrepair, lawmakers said
Thursday.
   The park that is the site of Independence Hall and the Liberty
Bell is projecting a deficit of between $400,000 and $800,000, six
Philadelphia-area members of Congress said in a letter to National
Park Service Regional Director James W. Coleman.
   The shingles on Independence Hall ``can be crushed to sawdust in
your hands,'' the letter said.
   The budget shortfall ``is definitely making a difference in the
appearance of the park,'' park spokeswoman Kathy Dilonardo said in
a telephone interview.
   ``The roof leaks when the wind drives the rain in a certain
direction,'' she said of the building where the Declaration of
Independence was signed in 1776.
   The water drips into a second-floor gallery once used for
banquets by the Penns, Pennsylvania's founding family.
   The budget woes also have kept officials from repairing 11
fountains and fixing uneven brickwork on the park grounds,
Dilonardo said.
   The park closed six buildings last winter to save money.
   Among the casualties was Old City Hall, where the Supreme Court
met from 1791 to 1800. The building reopened April 1 for the peak
tourist period, but will close again for the season in October,
Dilonardo said.
   Rep. Thomas Foglietta, D-Pa., whose district includes the
buildings, said in a news release that the park budget has fallen
from $7.2 million in 1980 to $6.9 million this year, not counting
inflation.
   He organized the letter, which requests $100,000 for roof
repairs and $300,000 to fix a dilapidated section of park that
includes trees, walkways and fountains. The money would come from a
fund used for National Park Service maintenance projects in the
Mid-Atlantic region.
   More than 3 million people visit the park each year.
   Coleman, the regional Park Service official, was out of the
office Thursday and unavailable for comment.

   The military-backed caretaker
government on Thursday blamed partisans of ousted Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto for a two-day ethnic rampage in which 30 people died.
   Police arrested at least 32 suspects, officials said, and all
but three are members of Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party. But
the government admitted it had no proof of their guilt.
   ``Of course, we arrested them. If we didn't arrest them, how
could we be sure? Once we have a lead, we'll have an open-and-shut
case,'' Interior Minister Zahid Safraz told reporters in the
capital, Islamabad.
   The latest round of ethnic violence in Ms. Bhutto's hometown was
sparked by the return of Altaf Hussein, the militant leader of the
Mohajir Qami Movement, or Refugee People's Movement representing
Indian immigrants from the 1947 partition of the subcontinent.
   Snipers fired from rooftops into a crowd celebrating Hussein's
return Thursday, killing at least one person and injuring six,
police said.
   On Wednesday, marauding gunmen fired into a crowd preparing for
his return, killing at least 29 people and injuring 50, police said.
   No one claimed responsibility for either attack, the latest in a
resurging wave of gang warfare that has claimed at least 500 lives
since late May.
   Jam Saddiq Ali, the chief minister of Sindh Province, said 32
people had been arrested in Wednesday's attack and 28 belonged to
Ms. Bhutto's left-of-center People's Party.
   Jam said they launched the attacks to discredit the caretaker
government that replaced Ms. Bhutto two weeks ago after her
government was dismissed on charges of corruption and abuse of
power.
   About 40,000 slogan-chanting supporters crowded into Karachi
International Airport and blocked surrounding streets to greet
Hussein, 36, who had been in London since mid-May undergoing
treatment for a kidney ailment.
   About 250,000 people attended a rally Thursday evening for
Hussein. Police earlier said more than 1 million people were
expected. All markets and businesses closed throughout Karachi, a
city of 9 million residents that is the country's financial and
industrial center.
   The Movement, which overwhelmingly dominates Karachi and other
cities in Sindh Province, is demanding recognition as Pakistan's
fifth nationality, along with the Pathans, Baluch, Punjabis and
Sindhis.
   For years, Karachi has been an urban battlefield between rival
ethnic and political groups. Authorities estimate at least 2,000
people have been killed and thousands more injured since violence
began in 1985.
   President Ghulman Ishaq Khan dismissed Ms. Bhutto's governnment
Aug. 6, citing its inability to stop the killings as one reason.
   The Movement was once Ms. Bhutto's ally. But after complaining
of broken campaign promises, it joined her opposition in late
November.

   A run-amok computer on Magellan got a
partial memory transplant Thursday as engineers treated symptoms of
a mysterious ailment that twice made them lose touch with the
Venus-orbiting spaceship.
   The malfunctions ``have shaken the spacecraft, but the overall
spacecraft remains very healthy, and we're very optimistic we'll be
back to a fruitful mission soon,'' said Ed Sherry, technical
assistant to Magellan's project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Magellan is on a $744-million mission to use its radar to peer
through the clouds of Venus and make the most detailed pictures and
maps yet of the second planet from the sun. It went into orbit
around Venus on Aug. 10, about 15 months after it was launched from
the shuttle Atlantis. It now is about 149 million miles from Earth.
   Lab spokesman Jim Doyle said it isn't yet known how long
Magellan's troubles will delay the official start of its mapping
effort, which was to begin the first week of September.
   More pictures from Magellan's first radar test will be released
Friday, he said. The first pictures, released Tuesday, showed
numerous ``Venusquake'' faults, old lava flows, craters, cinder
cones, valleys and ridges on the planet.
   Engineers continued unloading Magellan's computer memory banks
Thursday to get flight data that will help them figure out why
Magellan broke off radio contact for more than 14 hours Aug. 16-17
and again for 17{ hours ending Wednesday afternoon.
   On both occasions, engineers sent computer commands to
Magellan's presumed position to get its safety systems to restore
radio contact.
   The ultimate problem that made Magellan lose contact on both
occasions remains unknown. But flight data show that Tuesday night,
the spacecraft's automatic safety systems were unable to maintain
radio contact as expected because part of the memory was
``corrupted'' in a backup computer that helps point Magellan,
Sherry said.
   So engineers replaced the faulty contents of that computer's
memory with a rewritten version that was radioed to the spacecraft
Thursday, he said.
   ``We don't know what triggered these events,'' he added. ``We're
fixing the symptoms. We're taking the steps to keep Magellan
running.''
   Engineers also reactivated Magellan's safety systems, some of
which were intentionally disabled Wednesday to prevent them from
again cutting off contact between the spacecraft and Earth.
   The spacecraft has four computers: a main computer and its
backup, and an ``attitude-control'' computer and backup that help
aim Magellan.
   Sherry said the backup pointing computer ``started to run amok''
Aug. 16 after an unknown problem triggered a chain of events that
made Magellan lose contact the first time. That's when four
computer ``words'' in its memory went bad, he added.
   When another yet-undiagnosed problem developed Tuesday night,
the main computer checked the condition of the backup pointing
computer, found ``something was not kosher'' in its memory and, as
a result, assumed Magellan was pointing in the wrong direction _
which it wasn't, Sherry said.
   That mistake prompted automatic safety systems to protect
Magellan by turning the spacecraft to make sure its solar panels
could draw power from the sun. When the spacecraft turned, contact
was lost because its secondary antenna no longer pointed at Earth.
   Doyle said the mixed message between the main computer and the
backup pointing computer was ``like someone wants to mail you
something, but the post office has your address messed up.''
   After contact was lost Tuesday night, some NASA officials feared
Magellan might be lost forever. But Sherry said that when contact
was restored, ``a lot of the engineers sat there smugly and said,
`We told you the spacecraft was a real honey and would do what it
was built to do.'''

   Government troops deployed on an
island across from the chief stronghold of ethnic Tamil rebels and
launched a broad offensive to lift the 10-week siege of a fort, the
deputy defense minister said Thursday.
   It appeared to be the largest military action since the Tamil
Tiger rebels broke a 13-month cease-fire in June and resumed their
war for independence against the Sinhalese-dominated government.
   Deputy Defense Minister Ranjan Wijeratne said the troops landed
Wednesday on Kayts Island across the lagoon from Jaffna Peninsula,
the chief rebel stronghold.
   Wijeratne gave no casualty figures and declined to say how many
troops had been deployed.
   A garrison of about 250 policemen and soldiers have been
surrounded since June 11 in Jaffna Fort, a 300-year-old fortress
which dominates Jaffna town.
   Wijeratne, who is directing the government's war effort, said
the government forces met little resistance on Kayts Island, which
faces the fort across 4 miles of water.
   The fort is the largest of several military camps which were cut
off in Jaffna Peninsula, a densely populated piece of land that
curves toward the southern coast of India.
   The star-shaped fort, whose massive walls were erected by
successive Portuguese, Dutch and British colonial rulers, is
besieged by Tiger guerrillas who are dug into reinforced bunkers.
   Military officials said at least 20 rebels were killed in aerial
bombing and strafing raids Wednesday, the first day of the
government's latest offensive. The officials, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said only seven soldiers were wounded.
   There was no confirmation of the reports. Communications with
the north has been disrupted since the latest round of fighting
broke out on June 11.
   Wijeratne Thursday withdrew an earlier offer to evacuate the
fort and turn it over to the International Committee of the Red
Cross.
   He said the Red Cross spent 10 days evaluating the proposal and
only agreed Wednesday when the offensive was underway.
   ``Now I don't have to evacuate the fort. Why should I?''
Wijeratne said. He said government forces expected to retake the
fort in two or three days.
   Government troops moved out of their military camps Wednesday,
recapturing some areas and expanding their perimeters, according to
military officials who cannot be identified under briefing rules.
   The Tigers rained mortars and fired rockets and small arms at a
military airstrip near Jaffna and two other camps, they added.
   The Jaffna Peninsula is 185 miles northeast of Colombo.
   Ethnic Tamil rebels took up arms in 1983, claiming that the
Tamil minority needed a separate state to preserve its language and
culture and to combat discrimination by Sri Lanka's Sinhalese
majority.
   Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of the country's 16 million
people, have controlled the government and military since the
Indian Ocean island became independent from Britain in 1949. The
Sinhalese are mostly Buddhists.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindu, comprise 18 percent of the
population but have an overwhelming majority in the north and a
hefty minority in the east.
   At least 14,000 people have died in the 7-year-old Tamil
insurrection. Government officials estimate the death toll since
June 11 at 5,000.

   Six ships carrying 3,000 West
African soldiers sailed Thursday to enforce a cease-fire in
Liberia, where a 10,000-strong rebel army threatens to fight them
to the last man.
   The West African Economic Community sent the soldiers and
emphasized its task force was on a peaceful mission to halt the
8-month-old civil war in which 5,000 people have died, mostly
civilians.
   Rebel chief Charles Taylor says the peace plan is a maneuver to
keep President Samuel Doe in power. Taylor's National Patriotic
Front of Liberia has the largest of the three armies in the West
African nation of 2.5 million residents.
   Rebel leader Prince Johnson, a rival of Taylor, and forces loyal
to Doe have accepted a truce. Johnson's men and Doe's forces
control the capital of Monrovia, including the port. Taylor's force
controls most of the rest of Liberia, but has been unable to fight
its way into complete control.
   The fleet could reach Monrovia early Friday. But it was unclear
whether the task force would enter or wait offshore for more
negotiations to bring about a truce. Its commander, Lt. Gen. Arnold
Quainoo of Ghana, has said he did not want to risk entering Liberia
until all sides agreed to stop fighting.
   Peace talks were to resume Monday, but Taylor has not said
whether he would send envoys.
   Troops from Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Gambia and Guinea have
been assembling for weeks. Togo said it would send troops, but did
not.
   Efforts to persuade Taylor to accept the force collapsed
Wednesday after his representatives and West African leaders
conferred for two days in Banjul, Gambia.
   A statement from the office of Gambian leader Sir Dawda Jawara,
chairman of the West African organization, blamed Taylor for the
talks' failure.
   It said the meeting agreed to meet Taylor's demands for an
initial 10-day truce, but Taylor's envoys backed off when they
heard Doe and Johnson agreed.
   Taylor has said he is concerned that hundreds of the soldiers
come from Nigeria and Guinea, whose leaders in the past have
supported Doe. He led his forces into Liberia from Ivory Coast on
Dec. 24, saying Doe's government was corrupt and he would oust it.
   Taylor has refused to allow thousands of Nigerians and Guineans
caught behind his lines on Monrovia's eastern outskirts to leave
the country.
   His spokesman, Tom Woewiyu, said Tuesday the rebels would
``fight to the last man'' against the West African soldiers.
   ``There are enough guns floating around in Liberia . . . for a
group of people to come to Liberia with even bigger guns is like
putting an explosive in a fire,'' he said.
   Taylor reportedly said this week the intervention would leave
him free to call on whomever he pleased for help. He has denied
charges by the United States and by Johnson, who used to be his
chief commander, that his rebels were trained and armed by Libya
and Burkina Faso.
   West African leaders decided to intervene Aug. 6. They said the
war was no longer an internal conflict because thousands of their
citizens were trapped in Liberia and about 400,000 Liberian
refugees were burdening neighboring countries.

   The Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith on
Thursday asked the Pentagon to look into reports that Jewish
soldiers headed for Saudi Arabia have been told to consider
concealing their religion and getting non-denominational dog tags.
   While offering soldiers the option not to display their
religious affiliation may be well-intentioned, ``it is unclear
exactly what procedure is being followed and upon whose orders,''
ADL National Director Abraham Foxman said in a letter to Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney.
   ``It is imperative that this issue be presented in a manner
which is not only consistent with military security but is also
sensitive to the concerns of all service personnel while not being
perceived as coercive,'' Foxman wrote.
   He suggested that, if such protections are needed, the Defense
Department should issue a directive to all American service
personnel outlining the options on religious affiliation.
   Foxman's letter came one day after Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan,
D-N.Y., said he had received complaints from the parents of a
Jewish soldier who was advised to get a ``non-Jewish identity''
before going to Saudi Arabia.
   In his letter to Cheney, Moynihan called the reported incident
``an apparent extension of our sorry policy of many years' standing
of turning a blind eye to Saudi policy of refusing visas to
Americans of the Jewish religion.''
   Cheney, on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' said Thursday that
the Saudis ``have accepted all forces as is, regardless of
religion.''
   ``I would speculate that some uninformed individual down the
chain of command in the organization may have told the soldiers
something based upon speculation. The fact is the Saudis have not
imposed such restrictions on us and we obviously would not agree to
that,'' Cheney said.
   The soldier's father, who spoke to The Associated Press on the
condition that his name not be used, said he was disturbed that his
son would be given such an option.
   ``I started to make some phone calls. I found out that no other
religion has to change their dog tags,'' he said. ``I know in World
War II, nobody had to change their dog tags, and we were fighting
Nazi Germany, who did a lot worse than what's happening over
there.''
   Maj. Nancy Burt, an Army spokeswoman, said the service has no
official policy on advising Jewish soldiers about changing their
religious identities before going to the Middle East.
   ``It's a personal matter, as far as we're concerned,'' she said.
``A soldier decides on his own.''
   However, she said, if such an incident occurred at a base, ``we
wouldn't know about it at this level.''
   There are approximately 7,700 Jews in the U.S. military,
including about 1,300 in the Army, according to the Pentagon.

   A series of explosions and a fire at chemical
plant in central Russia on Thursday injured 25 people and forced
the evacuation of a nearby village, the Soviet news agency Tass
reported.
   The accident, in the Bashkir capital of Ufa, began when a new
phenol-acetone factory blew up as it was being readied for
production, Tass said.
   The fire continued through the day, and may have spread to other
facilities producing hydrocarbons, Tass said. Most of those injured
suffered severe burns, and two were in serious condition.
   In addition, phenol spilled into at least two rivers, including
the source of drinking water for the city of 1 million people, Tass
said. Drinking water was later transported into the city.
   A village about nine miles away was evacuated because the wind
blew toxic smoke from the fire in its direction, Bashkir Health
Minister Aldzhet Turyanov said.

   The Pentagon on Thursday announced the first
deployment of American forces from European NATO bases to the
Middle East buildup against Iraq.
   Troops from the U.S. Army Europe's 7th Medical Command, based in
West Germany, are heading to the Persian Gulf area as part of
Operation Desert Shield, the effort to defend Saudi Arabia against
a possible Iraqi attack.
   The Pentagon, in line with its practice since the buildup began
Aug. 8, provided no details on the number of military personnel
deployed from the 7th Medical Command.
   Also, the U.S. Air Force is deploying C-130E ``Hercules''
transport aircraft of the 435th Tactical Airlift Wing to the gulf
area from a West German base, the Pentagon said. No details were
given.
   Separately, the Pentagon announced that elements of the Army's
3rd Corps Artillery at Fort Sill, Okla., are joining the U.S.
forces already in Saudi Arabia. The 3rd Corps, comprised of three
artillery brigades, is equipped with 105mm, 155mm and 8-inch
artillery guns as well as Lance short-range missiles.
   The Pentagon also announced that the West German government has
provided 10 ``Fox'' chemical monitoring vehicles for use by U.S.
forces participating in Desert Shield. These self-propelled
vehicles can fully monitor a battlefield environment for traces of
chemical agents while protecting the operating crew from exposure.
   U.S. military officials have expressed concern that the Iraqi
army might use chemical weapons in combat.
   The U.S. government had several of the West German vehicles on
order before the Iraqi crisis started. The Bonn government offered
to provide the 10 vehicles from its own inventory in order to help
the U.S. operation in Saudi Arabia, the Pentagon said.
   U.S. military personnel will train in the operation of the
vehicles at a West German facility in Sonthofen.

<HEAD>Guam Abortion Law Rescinded; May Set Stage for Supreme Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AGANA, Guam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge overturned the nation's most
restrictive abortion law on Thursday. Pro-choice activists said an
appeal of that ruling would threaten the Supreme Court's landmark
Roe vs. Wade decision.
   U.S. District Judge Alex Munson declared that Roe vs. Wade, the
1973 decision establishing the right to an abortion, ``applied with
equal force and effect to Guam.''
   Government attorneys and other defendants in the case argued the
law did not apply to Guam because of the island's status as an
unincorporated territory.
   The law, signed by Gov. Joseph Ada on March 19, banned abortions
except when the woman's life is in danger. But Munson on March 23
blocked its enforcement while he weighed a challenge to the law
from abortion-rights forces.
   ``The threat we live with is that the Supreme Court has
indicated a willingness to overturn Roe vs. Wade,'' Kate Michelman,
executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League,
said in a telephone interview from Washington.
   ``If the governor appeals (Munson's ruling) he will endanger the
rights of all women by providing the vehicle for the overturning of
Roe vs. Wade. Our goal is to keep these cases out of the courts,''
Michelman said.
   The governor said he did not know whether he would appeal.
   ``I'm still very pro-life, and I believe that a fetus is a human
being and should be given life,'' said Ada, a Roman Catholic like
the vast majority of Guam's residents.
   Abortion opponents say they were not surprised by the judge's
decision, adding the next step probably will be an appeal that
would send the case to the Supreme Court.
   ``We figured that it wouldn't be an easy climb,'' said Roland
Rivera, vice president of Guamanians United for Life. ``There is
just the next higher level to pursue.''
   ``Guam's strong law ... could not be upheld without overturning
Roe vs. Wade,'' said Rep. Woody Jenkins, D-La., lead author of an
anti-abortion bill approved by the Louisiana Legislature but vetoed
by Gov. Buddy Roemer.
   ``Although it's not surprising that a federal district judge
would follow the Roe decision and rule against the Guam law, it
must be remembered that this is just the first stage in the
process,'' Jenkins said.
   ``What is important is that this decision be appealed all the
way to the Supreme Court so that the highest court in the land is
given the chance to stop the killing of unborn babies,'' he said in
Baton Rouge.
   Munson's ruling said the law was unconstitutional because it
violated free speech and due process clauses of the Constitution.
   ``The ruling tells states they don't have the power to overturn
Roe vs. Wade,'' Simon Heller, an attorney with the Reproductive
Freedom Project of the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a
telephone interview from New York. ``But I doubt it will stop
legislatures from adopting similar laws. It's not like the Supreme
Court issued this ruling.''

   The U.S. Embassy in Kuwait is normally guarded
by just a few Marines who provide no-frills security for the
compound, a former U.S. ambassador said on Thursday.
   And removing them now ``makes sense,'' said Francois Dickman, a
retired Foreign Service officer who was ambassador to Kuwait from
1979 to 1983.
   ``They don't really serve as guards,'' Dickman said in a
telephone interview from his home in Laramie, Wyo. ``They man the
entrance to the chancery and in the evening they make sure that
things are locked up and provide elementary security.''
   Dickman said that when he was ambassador the Marines lived a
block away from the embassy compound, but he heard at one time
since that they were living within the enclosure.
   ``These Marines can't do anything,'' he said. ``There are only
six of them. It is possible the number has been increased, but
normally it's a contingent of six.''
   He said the unit consisted of one non-commissioned officer in
command and five enlisted Marines.

<TEXT>
   The Proctor-Silex Co. is setting aside
``several million dollars'' to provide free coffee makers to an
estimated 800,000 consumers who purchased a model mow declared a
fire hazard, company officials said Thursday.
   Arnold Dreyfus, the corporation's chairman, declined to say
exactly how much the recall would cost, remarking only that it
would depend on how many recalled coffee makers are turned in.
   Commenting in a telephone interview from Proctor-Silex
headquarters in Richmond, Va., Dreyfus said the recalled models
were made in 1985 and 1986 and have since been discontinued.
   ``This problem did not manifest itself until much later,'' he
said.
   Proctor-Silex says it believes the recalled coffee makers are
subject to potentially dangerous over heating because their
thermostats and thermal fuses may malfunction.
   Dreyfus said the company is trying to identify the vendors that
provided the allegedly ``bad fuses.''
   The company said more than 200 telephone operators are fielding
calls about Proctor-Silex automatic drip coffee makers and issuing
instructions on how to turn in recalled models and receive a free
appliance.
   Company officials acknowledged that the initial volume has been
so heavy that many consumers get repeated busy signals.
   The toll-free number set up by the company is 1-800-341-3333.
   Dreyfus said the company is pleased so many people are calling
the number because the calls will result in ``taking a product with
a part that doesn't function properly out of the kitchen.''
   Proctor-Silex and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission
announced the recall on Thursday.
   The company said it had received 181 reports of fire involving
the coffee maker. It was sold nationwide in thousands of commercial
outlets, including Sears and J.C. Penney.
   The company said owners of suspected models should unplug them
immediately.
   ``People were reporting heat, smoke and meltdown and that could
have led to a fire,'' Dreyfus said.
   Some of the fires reported to the company caused property
damage. One owner received a minor burn when picking up an
overheated unit, the company said.
   Dreyfus said a number of people have sued the company for
damages resulting from malfunctioning coffee makers but said he did
not know how many.
   The recall includes Proctor-Silex coffee makers with model
numbers that begin with A4 or A5 and series numbers that end with
the numbers 58 or 68.
   Recalled Sears Counter Craft and Sears Kenmore coffee makers are
models 360.480293 and 360.480272.
   The Consumer Products Safety Commission noted that the last
digit may vary.
   Recalled J.C. Penney coffee makers have the model number
784-2178H or G and a ``C'' number ending in 58 or 68.
   Coffee makers produced after 1985 and bearing model numbers
beginning with A6 are not being recalled.

   Kindergarten teacher Jean Smith says she
won't be seeing double, seeing double, seeing double despite having
three sets of twins in her classes this fall at Franklin Public
Schools.
   Melinda and Melissa Rasmussen, 6 and of Franklin, Madeline and
Spencer Turner, 5 and of Naponee, and Zackery and Karsen Zade, 5
and of Franklin, began school Tuesday as part of the Class of 2003.
   ``I just treat them like separate children,'' Smith said.
   ``I've never had that many twins in one class,'' she said.
``But, I'm grateful they are not identical.''
   Each set of twins are seated apart from each other, she said.
The Rasmussen twins and the Turner twins attend morning classes
while the Zade twins go to afternoon classes. Each class has 14
students.
   ``I think Mrs. Smith has my two separated for good reasons,''
said Deb Zade, mother of the Zade twins. ``They take turns being
aggressive and would probably boss each other around if they were
sitting together.''
   Sheri Rasmussen said her twin daughters were ready for school.
   ``They stayed at a day care and knew a lot of the kids before
school started,'' she said.
   Mrs. Turner said her twins spent most of their time entertaining
each other before school started because they live on a farm out in
the country.
   ``I think they liked getting together with the other kids,'' she
said. ``Riding the bus was a big thrill. It was the first time they
have ever gone on their own.''

   A referendum to protect the rights
of homosexuals in ``Anita Bryant country'' is building into a
confrontation reminiscent of the 1977 campaign led by the singer
and former citrus queen.
   Opponents of the proposed measure have even borrowed the ``Save
our Children'' slogan Bryant used to help win repeal of a gay
rights ordinance in Dade County, which includes Miami, more than a
decade ago.
   Eighty-eight counties, cities and municipalities, including Palo
Alto, Calif., Iowa City, Iowa, and Palm Beach County in Florida
have laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual
orientation. Massachusetts and Wisconsin have state
anti-discrimination laws.
   But the only other gay-rights referendum was in 1987, when
voters in Boulder, Colo., approved the measure.
   ``We are watching it closely in part because it's a popular vote
issue and because of where it is,'' Paul DiDonato, spokesman for
the National Gay Rights Advocates in San Francisco, said of the
Broward County referendum.
   The county, Dade's neighbor to the north, has a reputation for
spring breaks and tiny bikinis. But in March, it gained attention
when its sheriff banned 2 Live Crew's raunchy rap album from record
stores.
   Broward already prohibits discrimination on the basis of race,
color, religion, national origin, sex, age, marital status,
political affiliation or handicap.
   ``The only thing that the amendment does is to add sexual
orientation to that list,'' said Allan Terl, an attorney and gay
activist who helped prepare the measure for the Sept. 4 primary
ballot. ``Anybody who tells you it would do more than that is lying
to you.''
   Referendum opponents cast the measure in more alarming tones.
   ``They want to legitimize homosexuality. It's immoral. Anal sex
is not the community standard,'' said Maurice Baum, head of the
local branch of Christian Coalition, a group founded by
televangelist Pat Robertson.
   The measure would allow more homosexual teachers, he said, and
``these teachers would molest our children. These people would give
our children an incurable disease.''
   Activists worked for more than a year to get the measure on the
ballot. In recent weeks the campaign has become emotional, even
leading to claims of death threats from both sides.
   Miami's Archbishop Edward McCarthy sent a letter to Broward
County's 49 parishes calling the referendum ``morally
unacceptable'' and asking them to blast the proposed law from the
pulpit. That prompted advocates to picket the archdiocese.
   Baum said the Christian Coalition has the silent support of
Bryant. But the singer's manager, Paul Bartholomew, said she is not
involved.
   Bryant's singing career took a tumble after she led the 1977
Dade County campaign. The citrus industry fired her as its
spokeswoman, although in 1988 she was inducted into the Florida
Citrus Hall of Fame.
   ``We have simply put it behind us,'' Bartholomew said. ``She
spoke, she made her stand, and paid a very dear price.''
   Leaders of the gay community estimate that about 100,000 of the
county's 1.3 million residents are gay and will turn out in full
force.
   The proposed referendum asks the county's 627,000 registered
voters: ``Shall the Broward County Human Rights Act be amended to
include discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation as a
discriminatory classification?''
   It would allow the county's Human Rights Board to investigate
allegations of discrimination in job hiring, housing and all real
estate transactions.
   ``The Broward County referendum is definitely in the spotlight
around the country in the gay and lesbian community,'' said Robert
Bray of the National Gay &amp; Lesbian Task Force in Washington, D.C.
``If we can pass it there, in the heart of Anita Bryant country, we
can pass it anywhere.''

<HEAD>Banking Chairman Says Some S&amp;L Sales Were `Giveaways'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Banking Committee
predicted on Thursday that the Bush administration will have to
renegotiate many sales of savings and loans the government
completed at the end of 1988.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, said committee investigators
found that investors had received $78 in assets and
government-granted benefits for every $1 of capital they put up to
purchase the S&amp;Ls.
   ``Many of these resolutions went beyond sweetheart deals and
amounted to virtual giveaways,'' Gonzalez said in announcing that
his committee had scheduled a Sept. 14 hearing to examine the
controversial sales.
   Gonzalez said the committee would examine the results of a staff
investigation of 94 of the 1988 deals, focusing particularly on
sales of American Savings of California and two giant Texas S&amp;Ls,
First Gibraltar and Southwest Savings of Texas.
   The House Banking Committee investigation is only one of several
being conducted on the 1988 S&amp;L sales, which were completed by the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the now defunct agency which at the
time supervised the country's S&amp;L industry.
   The Resolution Trust Corp., the agency created last year by
Congress to clean up the S&amp;L mess, is scheduled to complete its own
study soon into whether the government would be better off by
exercising contract options allowing the government to get out of
some of the guarantees made in the 1988 deals.
   Gonzalez said that an effort to renegotiate some of the 1988
deals should be made even though he recognized that would involve
``monumental legal and financial problems.''
   ``It may be better for the government to buy out some of the
contracts _ at least the most onerous parts of the contracts _
rather than letting the costs mount under long-term guarantees,''
Gonzalez said.
   He said unless the Bush administration renegotiates some of the
1988 deals, it would further increase the price tag of the S&amp;L
bailout, already the costliest government bailout in history.
   The sales have been defended by former Bank Board Chairman M.
Danny Wall as a crash effort by the government to transfer into
private hands insolvent S&amp;Ls which were draining billions of
dollars out of the government's insurance fund.
   But critics have charged that in its headlong rush to complete
S&amp;L sales in 1988, the government entered into contracts that will
virtually assure S&amp;L purchasers of a profit from generous
government subsidies that will end up costing taxpayers more in the
long run.
   Earlier this month, a Senate Judiciary subcommittee chaired by
Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, raised questions about what is now
known as Bluebonnet Savings Bank of Dallas, which was sold to James
M. Fail, an Arizona insurance executive.
   Fail put up only $1,000 of his own money and borrowed another
$70 million to complete a transaction that investigators said
qualified him for at least $1.85 billion in government subsidies.

   The official Iranian news agency said
Thursday that a European hostage held in Lebanon would be released
soon.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency said the hostage to be freed
was likely to be Brian Keenan, an Irish national held since April
1986.
   The morning report from the agency's Beirut office quoted an
unidentified source as saying the release could come within hours.
   IRNA did not name the source. The news agency carried a similar
report on an imminent release in July that proved false.
   In Dublin, Ireland, the Department of Foreign Affairs said: ``We
are aware of the report and would point to its speculative nature.''
   In Beirut, a source close to the Syrian command, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the Syrian government was notified two
days ago of the decision to free a European hostage, probably
Keenan.
   He said arrangements had been discussed on where, when and how
the release would take place.
   But Nasser Kaddour, Syria's deputy foreign minister, said, ``I
have no information on the release of any hostage.''
   A source at the Ministry of Information in Damascus said they
had no immediate information about the possible release.
   Gerben Meihuizen, the Dutch ambassador to Syria, said he had
``no confirmation'' of the report. The Netherlands handles Irish
interests in Damascus.
   Keenan's family in Northern Ireland reacted cautiously to the
report.
   ``We've heard nothing about this and we won't get our hopes
built up after last month,'' said Keenan's sister, Elaine Spence of
Belfast, Northern Ireland. ``You can't live with getting your hopes
built up and brought down too often.''
   Keenan, 39, was kidnapped April 11, 1986 in west Beirut while
walking to his job as an English teacher at the American University
in Beirut.
   Two Swiss Red Cross workers were released separately earlier
this month after being held 10 months in Lebanon.
   Their release left 14 Westerners held hostage in Lebanon. Most
are believed held by extremist Moslem groups loyal to Iran. In
addition to Keenan, they include six Americans, four Britons, two
West Germans and an Italian.
   The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was abducted March 16,
1985.

   Thousands of people said goodbye to Pearl
Bailey, who was remembered at her funeral Thursday as an
extraordinary entertainer and a woman who loved life and everyone
she met.
   ``Pearl was love, pure and simple love,'' said jazz legend Cab
Calloway.
   ``I mean it from my heart and soul, that Pearl Bailey was
something you'll never see again,'' said Calloway, who was a
pallbearer and who co-starred with Miss Bailey in the all-black
production of ``Hello, Dolly'' that brought her a Tony award and
worldwide acclaim.
   About 2,000 people filled the Deliverance Evangelistic Church
while scores waited outside in cool, overcast weather for a glimpse
of the casket and the singer's body, which was dressed in blue and
adorned with a string of pearls. A single red rose was placed in
her hand.
   Flowers from Lena Horne and Ella Fitzgerald were among those
displayed in the church, but for the most part the mourners were
friends, family and ordinary people.
   Miss Bailey, who spent much of her childhood in Philadelphia,
died here Friday at age 72, apparently of a heart attack.
   The funeral service consisted of hymns, poetry and fond
recollections _ just as Pearl would have wanted it, friends said.
   ``If you knew Miss Bailey, she would like it to be plain and
simple, not a lot of fanfare,'' the Rev. Timothy Jones, assistant
pastor at the church, told the gathering.
   ``She loved everybody,'' said her husband of 38 years, jazz
drummer Louis Bellson Jr. ``I have a feeling if she knew we were
making all this fuss, she'd say, `Louie, What are you doing?'
   ``They will remember her as a great entertaineer,'' he said.
``She was a person of love. She believed `show business' was `show
love.' ''
   ``She was a trailblazer, a teacher for all of us. If you wanted
to learn to do it right, you watched Pearl Bailey,'' said singer
Tony Orlando.
   Rabbi Harold S. White, a lecturer at Georgetown University where
Miss Bailey earned a degree in theology, said she ``craved privacy
with her beloved Louie. She said of herself, `What you see is what
you get.' She chided name-droppers.''
   After the service, Miss Bailey was buried at Rolling Green
Memorial Park in nearby West Chester, where her mother and brother
are buried.
   Miss Bailey's older sister, Virgie Murray, is a member of
Deliverance Evangelistic Church.
   On Wednesday evening, a private memorial brought several people
to the church's door, where they stood in the rain, Bellson said.
   ``That's love. It's an outpouring of love,'' he said. ``That's
the way Pearl was.''
   Hundreds lined the street outside the church Thursday morning
before the service to view the singer's body.
   Miss Bailey, who lived in Lake Havasu City, Ariz., collapsed in
her hotel room, where she was recovering from knee surgery. A
definite cause of death will not be known for weeks, but doctors
said the surgery apparently wasn't a factor.
   Her show business career started in Philadelphia at age 15 when
she sang ``Poor Butterfly'' in an amateur contest. She went on to a
successful career as a jazz singer, star of stage and screen, and
best-selling author. She was best known for her role in ``Hello,
Dolly.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush will soon be flying
aboard a brand new jumbo jet specially equipped with private
quarters and sophisticated communications equipment, his spokesman
said Thursday.
   Nearly two years after its originally scheduled delivery, the
Boeing 747 was handed over Thursday to the Air Force in Wichita,
Kan. It then was sent on to Andrews Air Force Base outside
Washington, D.C., for systems checking and training flights, White
House Press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said.
   The new jet and a second aircraft due to be delivered in June
1991 will replace the two planes that now serve as Air Force One
when the president flies. The current ones are Boeing 707s that
were built in 1962 and 1972.
   In Kansas, reporters toured parts of the plane as Lt. Col.
Calvin Kissick pointed out couches that turn into beds, a
conference room that seats eight around a table and a press section
complete with typewriters. Kissick said the plane has 19 television
sets and more than 80 phones.
   Reporters were not allowed to look into a classified work area.
   The plane is ready to fly as soon as Bush decides he wants it,
Kissick said.
   The fixed-price contract with Boeing was set in July 1986 at
$266 million for the two new planes, said Fitzwater. With parts and
equipment and a special hanger at Andrews, the government is paying
a total of $410 million for the two aircraft.
   The jet delivered Thursday, Fitzwater said, cruises at 560 miles
an hour and can go 6,200 nautical miles without refueling.
   Built for 70 passengers and 23 crew members, the new jet has a
state-of the art communications system and self-contained baggage
loader and air stairs, so that mobile stairs to enter the plane are
not needed, Fitzwater said.
   It also can refuel in flight.
   ``The mission communications system provides worldwide clearance
secure voice and data communications,'' Fitzwater said.
   The first new jet was due for delivery in November 1988, but was
delayed by engineering and technical problems having to do with
aircraft wiring, Fitzwater said.

<HEAD>Pinochet: Won't Leave Army Command, Will Stay Out of Politics</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former military ruler Gen. Augusto
Pinochet said Thursday he will retain command of the army, a
position publicly opposed by President Patricio Aylwin, his elected
civilian successor.
   At the same time, however, the 74-year-old general made clear he
is now out of politics, and fully dedicated to military affairs.
   At a ceremony marking his 17th anniversary as head of the army,
Pinochet insisted the army is devoted to ``purely professional
matters.''
   He added, ``We must also cooperate in the establishment and
maintenance of a situation of normalcy that guarantees to all
Chileans their complete freedom. We must ensure respect to a
superior legal order.''
   Pinochet was appointed commander in chief on Aug. 23, 1973, by
then-President Salvador Allende, the elected socialist leader he
toppled 19 days later in a violent military coup.
   Allende died during the coup in his presidential palace as the
palace was in flames and under heavy air and ground attack. The
military said he committed suicide.
   After handing over power to Aylwin on March 11, Pinochet
remained as army commander, sheltered by a clause in the 1980
constitution written by his government before he left office.
   Aylwin, who is constitutionally prohibited from firing him, made
a public appeal for his resignation, but Pinochet refused.
   In a message to army personnel Thursday, Pinochet repeated his
``decision to continue to lead the destiny of this unbeaten army.''
   Later, during a ceremony at the military academy, Pinochet was
promised ``our unrestricted loyalty'' by the army's second in
command, Gen. Jorge Lucar.
   Lucar, speaking on behalf of the army, also supported Pinochet's
decision to remain commander in chief ``because of the security
that your authority and experience give us.''
   The ceremony was set up as a purely military occasion. Prominent
right-wing politicians, including aides to Pinochet while he was
president, gathered at his house in the morning to congratulate
him. But none were invited to the military academy.
   A small group of people, mostly women, gathered outside the
heavily guarded academy in an upper-class Santiago neighborhood to
cheer Pinochet.

<TEXT>
   The leaders of this all-male monastic
republic declared a state of emergency Thursday as a 10-day-old
forest fire raged out of control.
   The fire had burned over 2,250 acres of chestnut trees and thick
brush by Thursday night, according to fire brigade officials. At
one point it threatened three of the 20 Eastern Orthodox
monasteries on the forested peninsula that reaches into the Aegean
Sea.
   Premier Constantine Mitsotakis ordered the Defense Ministry to
dispatch more troops to help combat the fire. Under the state of
emergency, the military will coordinate firefighting efforts.
   Authorities said 1,300 soldiers were battling the fire with the
community's 1,400 monks, hundreds of civilian volunteers from
neighboring regions and the crew of 10 fire engines.
   Strong winds kept firefighting planes from the peninsula
Thursday. Two warships were anchored nearby in stormy seas, ready
to evacuate monks and priceless treasures from the monasteries if
needed.
   The fire brigade said it was difficult for land firefighting
forces because of the lack of roads and firebreaks on the densely
wooded, 30-square-mile peninsula.
   Cause of the fire was unknown.
   The Mount Athos religious comunity was founded in 963.
   It enjoyed administrative independence under the Byzantine and
Ottoman empires and was made a theocratic republic under Greek
suzerainty in 1927. It is governed by a civil administrator and a
council of monks.
   Women and female animals are barred.

   Rain was scattered across the South and up the East Coast on
Thursday, and locally heavy downpours pushed some streams out of
their banks in the Virginias.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms fell across southwestern
Texas and the Texas Gulf Coast, southern Louisiana, central
Mississippi, east-central Alabama, Florida, west-central and
eastern Georgia, southeastern South Carolina, eastern North
Carolina, Virginia, northern West Virginia, Maryland, Delaware,
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and the southern half of New
England.
   As much as 10 inches of rain has fallen in the past two days
over Northumberland and Westmoreland counties in western Virginia,
and there was local flooding in the area, the National Weather
Service reported.
   In West Virginia, Glenville in Gilmer County received 3.95
inches of rain in the 24 hours ending at dawn Thursday, Hico in
Fayette County received 3.75 inches and the East Lynn Dam in Wayne
County and Clarksburg each received 2.5 inches, the weather service
said.
   That rain caused the Little Kanawha River to rise 6 feet at
Grantsville in the six hours up to 10 a.m. Thursday, but that
remained well below flood stage, the weather service said.
   West Virginia Red Cross officials began work Thursday assessing
damage to Wayne County homes hit by floods. At least 14 homes in
East Lynn were damaged by flooding Wednesday, said Michael L.
Bennett, chief executive officer for the Red Cross in West Virginia.
   Elsewhere, showers and thunderstorms were scattered over eastern
Colorado into northwestern Kansas, and from east-central and
southeastern Minnesota into northwestern Wisconsin.
   The heaviest rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT was
.65 of an inch at Elizabeth City, N.C.
   Albuquerque, N.M., cooled to a record low for the date of 54
degrees during the morning.
   West Palm Beach, Fla., warmed to a record-tying 95.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 59
degrees at Everett and Tacoma, Wash., to 100 at Thermal, Calif.
   Thursday's low for the Lower 48 states was 34 degrees at
Gunnison, Colo.

   A spilled solvent burst into flame at a
Shell Oil Co. petrochemical complex, causing a fire that injured
two workers and damaged a crude oil refining unit, plant officials
said.
   The fire apparently was caused by a spill of the solvent naptha,
said Shell spokesman Mark Singer. The blaze was sealed off shortly
after it was reported at 9:15 a.m., but continued to burn for
nearly eight hours, he said.
   The 1,500-acre manufacturing complex in an industrial area near
the Houston Ship Channel employes about 2,400 people. About 15
people were working in the area where the fire began, Singer said.
   One of two refining units at the plant was damaged, he said. The
two units refine about 225,000 barrels of crude oil daily, making
gasoline, lubricants, heating oil, aviation fuel and other fuels.
   The explosion came one day after the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration had announced a vigorous inspection program
for petrochemical plants in 10 states. The OSHA investigation was
spurred by an explosion at a nearby Phillips Petroleum Co. plant
that killed 23 people last year.
   Larry Keepers, a 37-year-old pipefitter, was in good condition
Thursday with first- and second-degree burns over about a quarter
of his body, Singer said.
   A second worker, whose name was not released, was sprayed with
naptha, a light crude oil derivative used as a blending component
in gasoline and as a chemical feedstock. The worker was treated at
the plant.

   A federal judge on Thursday sentenced
four members of the family that controlled Champion Insurance Co.,
whose failure left $150 million in unpaid claims and led to
criminal investigations of state officials.
   U.S. District Judge Frank Polozola sentenced Patricia King
Eicher, the wife of Champion owner John Eicher Jr., and Tina
Eicher, the wife of Naaman Eicher, to six months in prison.
   John Eicher's daughters, Meredith and Ashley, received
five-month sentences. All four had pleaded guilty to two counts of
aiding and abetting mail fraud.
   The women also were fined $10,000 each and ordered to serve two
to three years probation after their release. They were told to
surrender to federal authorities by Sept. 17.
   Champion, the third largest insuror in the state, collapsed in
June 1989, leaving behind millions in unpaid auto claims. Its
owners distributed at least $250,000 to politicians during the 1987
election year, authorities have alleged.
   U.S. Attorney Raymond Lamonica said Thursday that criminal
charges would be filed against elected officials, but refused to
give names.
   Already, Insurance Commissioner Doug Green has pleaded innocent
to charges the Eichers illegally funded his 1987 campaign and then
conspired with him to cover up the company's precarious financial
situation.
   According to earlier testimony, payments also were made to state
Reps. Sherman Copelin, Joe Delpit and Melvin Irvin. Copelin and
Delpit have denied taking any money from the Eichers. Irvin has not
commented. No charges have been filed in connection with the
payments.
   John and Naaman Eicher were ordered earlier to begin serving
46-month prison sentences by Monday on pleas they made.
   An FBI agent testified during the sentencing hearing that the
Eichers gave money to then-Gov. Edwin Edwards in 1987. Edwards has
said he returned the money because he could not find a legal way of
using it for campaign purposes.
   Lamonica said the prosecution of the Eichers ``will not cure the
tragic state of the insurance industry in this state.'' Louisiana
has been wracked by insurance company insolvencies for the past
several years.

<HEAD>Kohl Asks All-Out Effort To Heal East Germany's Wounds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, on
the threshhold of becoming the first leader of all Germany since
1945, appealed Thursday for an all-out effort to heal East
Germany's wounds.
   Just 12 hours earlier, the East German Parliament chose Oct. 3
as the day that nation will cease to exist and will merge with West
Germany.
   That means Kohl will become chancellor of all Germany on Oct. 3
until joint German elections are held on Dec. 2.
   Kohl hopes to win those elections, but is facing a tough
challenge from Oskar Lafontaine, candidate from the opposition
Social Democrats.
   There has been no single leader of all Germany since the World
War II defeat of Adolf Hitler's Third Reich in 1945.
   Parliament on Thursday ratified a treaty with East Germany that
will make possible the first all-German elections since 1933.
Government coalition partners and the opposition passed the measure
easily, with a show of hands.
   East German lawmakers approved the same treaty the previous day.
   In a 40-minute speech to Parliament, Kohl praised his fellow
Germans for persisting in their hopes of ending the division of
their homeland.
   ``Today is a day of joy for all Germans,'' said Kohl.
   Oct. 3, he said, ``will be a great day in the history of our
people. We are fulfilling a dream which many people among us had
already abandoned.''
   But Kohl warned his countrymen that overcoming East Germany's
considerable problems won't be easy. Unemployment is skyrocketing
in East Germany, crime is rising, and many East Germans feel
demoralized.
   ``We have a heavy responsibility,'' Kohl said.
   ``Even though we have every right to rejoice we know we are
standing before an extraordinary challenge _ overcoming the old
economic and social order'' in what is now East Germany, he said.
   Kohl, clearly trying to bolster his standing among voters with
elections 3{ months away, had high praise for East Germans.
   ``With their courage, their levelheadedness and above all their
love for freedom, they have given an example of how dictators can
be peacefully overcome,'' said Kohl, referring to last fall's
peaceful revolution that toppled 40 years of Stalinist rule.
   Kohl has made no secret of his desire to be considered the
father of German unity.
   In his parliamentary speech, he evoked the name of a beloved
past leader, Konrad Adenauer, while reviewing his own contributions
to the unity process.
   Lafontaine had some rare praise for Kohl, pointing out an
agreement by Kohl and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on
German unity.
   In that agreement, Gorbachev dropped his objections to NATO
membership for a united Germany in exchange for promises Red Army
troops can stay in East Germany for up to four years.
   But Lafontaine said many factors paved the way for unity.
   ``Without Gorbachev's reform policies, renewal in Eastern Europe
and in the GDR (East Germany) would not have been possible,'' he
said.

   An impostor horse named Milagros didn't
pull off the miracle she was named after in a race that police are
investigating after the bettors got stung.
   The ``ringer,'' distantly related to a Kentucky Derby winner,
was substituted for another winless horse racing at long odds. But
the impostor came in second, meaning thousands of dollars in rigged
bets went bad.
   The real Milagros had finished no better than 10th in five
previous starts, including a dismal performance in a June 27 race
at Mountaineer Park in Chester, W.Va.
   On the Aug. 16 race, the horse entered as Milagros went off at
6-1 odds but finished second, paying $9.80 for place and $5.20 for
show.
   ``Those are good odds if your horse is a sure thing to win, but
those guys must have really got stung,'' said Massachusetts Racing
Commission steward Rene Riera Jr. ``And you know,'' he added,
``milagros in Spanish means `miracles.' ''
   State investigators believe the impostor horse had multiple wins
to its credit in more competitive events than the Marshfield Fair.
The impostor was a similar-looking but faster filly named Joshua's
Sunny. The horse had a record of numerous second- and third-place
finishes.
   Investigators discovered the actual identity of the horse last
weekend, a day before the filly was entered in another race at the
fair.
   State Police Trooper Anthony Bille, one of three officers
investigating the case, said the first indication something was
wrong came when authorities inspected the horse's foal papers,
which include lineage and distinguishing physical characteristics.
   The form was filled out in blue ink except for the ID number,
which was typed in black ink.
   ``When we held it up to the light, we saw it covered other
numbers,'' Bille said. For the racetrack and bettors, Bille said,
``this is the ultimate nightmare. But we've got some solid leads.''
   The impostor horse is now under 24-hour armed guard.

<HEAD>Mohawks Say Army Too Close, Cancel Peace Talks in Quebec</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OKA, Quebec (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mohawk negotiators suspended talks with the
Quebec government Thursday after armored personnel carriers moved
into position near a barricade the Mohawks erected six weeks ago in
their land dispute.
   ``It's clear to me this is an intimidation tactic,'' said Mohawk
negotiator Joe Deom, surrounded by masked, gun-toting members of
the Warriors Society milling about the army vehicles. ``They're
making it more and more difficult to stay at the table.''
   Maj. Richard Larouche, an army spokesman, said the soldiers
advanced their position because armed Warriors were spotted coming
in and out of a milewide area separating army and Mohawk lines. The
army said it would stay in its new position, about 35 feet from the
Mohawk barricade.
   Despite that, native spokesmen _ not identified _ said the
Mohawks were ready to return to the bargaining table.
   Larouche said the military closed the gap after sending armored
personnel carriers to accompany a busload of Mohawk negotiators.
   Tempers in the region, 18 miles west of Montreal, were high.
   Residents were frustrated and furious over commuting hardships
and loss of business revenue caused by the Mohawk blockade of
Mercier Bridge, linking several communities on the south side of
the St. Lawrence River with Montreal.
   Crowds have tried to stop medical supplies and food from
reaching the Mohawk community and to keep Indians from leaving.
   The goverment guarantees access to the reserve while
negotiations continue, under an agreement reached Aug. 12. Federal
troops are at Oka in response to a request by Quebec Premier Robert
Bourassa.
   As local police watched Wednesday, Mohawks and whites brawled
after a crowd halted three cars with Mohawk passengers at
Ste-Catherine. Soldiers intervened and arrested five Indians.
   About 50 whites carrying crowbars and baseball bats patrolled
another road from the reserve. Tires were slashed on two Mohawk
vehicles and a van was overturned before the Indians fled.
   A Montreal demonstrator said, ``The police have to let them
through with their food. We don't.''
   The dispute arose from Oka's plans to expand a golf course onto
land said to be ancestral. One officer was killed in a gun battle
on July 11 when Quebec police tried to remove a Mohawk barrier.
Blame in the death has not been fixed.
   The Mohawks put some demands in writing for the first time
Wednesday. It was expected the Mohawks will propose giving native
reserves in Ontario and Quebec sovereignty over economic
development.
   On Thursday, the Mohawks boarded a rented bus bound for
negotiations at Oka when they were met by armored personnel
carriers.
   ``The one in front lowered its machine gun at the bus and they
said they were here to escort us to the talks,'' said Mohawk
spokesman Peter Diome.
   Diome quoted the soldiers as explaining that death threats had
been made against Indian negotiators. But the Mohawks called off
Thursday's talks, branding the army movement an ``act of
aggression. ''
   On Wednesday, angry whites stopped an ambulance from the
Kahnawake reserve carrying a Mohawk woman who had just given birth.
She was being rushed to a Montreal hospital because of birth
complications.
   ``Two of the protesters insisted on looking into the back of the
ambulance to verify there were no weapons and it was a real
emergency,'' said Mireille Sigmen, head of communications for the
ambulance service. She said the service is filing a complaint with
provincial police.
   Emergency vehicles are supposed to have unrestricted passage
over Mercier Bridge.
   Quebec's public security minister said Wednesday the dispute has
cost the government at least $85 million (U.S.) in police costs and
compensation.

nullified an attempt by the Russian republic to wrest control over
its vast natural resources from the central Soviet government.
   Gorbachev also said he would meet soon with the president of
Russia, Boris N. Yeltsin, in an effort to coordinate plans to shift
the Soviet Union to a market economy.
   At the same time Gorbachev issued his presidential decree,
Russia, the largest of the 15 Soviet republics, backed down from
its order earlier this month that declared invalid contracts signed
by the Soviet government.
   Its action averted _ or postponed _ a critical battle between
the national Soviet government and the resource-rich republic over
both the acquisition of badly needed foreign currency and the
division of power.
   Russia's Aug. 10 declaration had thrown into question scores of
lucrative contracts, including the $5 billion diamond deal with De
Beers, the world's leading dealer in diamond exports.
   Russia had maintained it voided all contracts, signed without
its approval, to sell the republic's diamonds, metals, oil, gas,
uranium and even any manufactured product it considers strategic.
   But on Thursday, Russia's deputy prime minister, Gennady
Filshin, said the republic had now decided to honor all agreements,
even those forged without its consent, the independent news agency
Interfax reported.
   He specifically mentioned the diamond contract, which was
considered lucrative for both the republic and the Soviet Union,
Interfax said.
   Gorbachev said Russia's earlier declaration could ``cause
serious damage to the country's interests, by complicating
possibilities to buy goods and win credits, which are needed so
badly amid current economic difficulties.
   ``It is effectively directed at undermining the economic
sovereignty of other union republics since it usurps the right to
manage products belonging to the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics,'' he said.
   Gorbachev declared the Russian action ``null and void,''
according to remarks carried on the Soviet TV program Vremya and by
the official Tass news agency.
   In a second presidential decree, Gorbachev granted the National
Academy of Sciences broad autonomy, ending decades of tight state
control.
   Gorbachev, in a television interview, said he spent six hours
Wednesday with the panel he and Yeltsin set up to forge a path
toward a market economy in the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev praised the panel and said it had made good progress,
predicting there would soon be a unified program. The panel is to
present its findings to the Soviet parliament early next month.
   He said he agreed with the commission's proposal to first
stabilize the country's economy, a process he said would take a few
months. He said this would take an edge off the transition period
and would avoid sharp price increases. He said the switch to a
market system would take 18 months to two years.
   On Thursday, Gorbachev met with Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai
Ryzhkov, who leads a second panel that is exploring ways to switch
to a market system.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Seven political parties demanded on
Thursday that President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot resign and elections
be put off until Haiti's political crisis is resolved.
   A letter from seven of the 12 parties that make up the Unity
Assembly coalition said the political climate is not conducive to
holding free and fair elections, tentatively set for Nov. 4.
   Panic meanwhile spread through downtown Port-au-Prince on
Thursday afternoon after 10 men piled out of a vehicle and _
brandishing weapons and throwing stones _ ordered pedestrians off
the streets. No one was hurt and police made arrests, Radio
Haiti-Inter reported.
   Presidential candidate Hubert de Ronceray called it ``an attempt
to intimidate and dissuade the population from participating in
upcoming elections.''
   The Unity Assembly appointed Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot, a Supreme
Court judge, as transitional president after military ruler Lt.
Gen. Prosper Avril was forced to flee this poor Caribbean island
nation last March.
   She is to govern alongside a 19-member Council of State until
elections. But political violence, a rise in crime and the return
of figures associated with the brutal Duvalier dynasty that ruled
Haiti for 29 years has put in doubt the holding of credible
elections.
   The Council of State, a quasi-legislative body, broke relations
with Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot last week and called her an ``obstacle''
to elections.
   Fears focus on the army, which was accused of allowing the
massacre of 34 voters at the polls during aborted November 1987
elections.
   ``Our problems begin and end with the army. It has not yet
decided to promote the democratic process,'' said presidential
candidate Louis Dejoie Jr.
   Armed forces chief Lt. Gen. Herard Abraham has said he supports
democratic elections.
   ``The executive must resign,'' the political parties wrote in a
letter to Electoral Council president Jean-Robert Sabalat. ``We ask
you to suspend the electoral timetable until the government crisis
is completely resolved.''
   The seven parties range from far left to far right.
   Dejean Belizaire, whose center-right National Patriotic Movement
was one of the five parties that did not sign the letter, said,
``If the government falls, the army will take over.''
   Haiti, with a population of more than 5.3 million, has been
almost exclusively under authoritarian rule since it won
independence from France in 1804.

<TEXT>
   Only 130 cases of paralysis in the Americas last
year were confirmed as polio, an 86 percent drop from the year
before, U.S. health officials said Thursday.
   Polio, which the Pan American Health Organization has targeted
for eradication in the Americas this year, was detected last year
in 99 of 14,372 Latin American counties, the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control reported.
   In 1988, 340 cases were confirmed; in 1986, there were 930.
   Out of the 130 cases last year, 24 were confirmed wild polio,
and eight were related to vaccinations. The rest were considered
confirmed, in the absence of other causes, even though many
patients died or were lost to follow-up, and detailed viral
analysis was not possible.
   The Pan American Health Organization's technical advisory group
has recommended not counting polio cases in the future unless they
can be virally confirmed.
   Worldwide, about 250,000 cases of the paralyzing viral disease
were reported last year. Some 25,000 patients died.
   Polio was wiped out in the United States after the 1954
introduction of the vaccine to prevent it. The last U.S. cases were
reported in the late 1970s.

<TEXT>
   An investigative reporter angered by The New
York Times' review of his book on the alleged links between
organized crime and the National Football League filed a $10
million libel lawsuit against the paper Thursday.
   Dan E. Moldea filed suit in U.S. District Court in Washington
over the newspaper's Sept. 3, 1989 review of his book,
``Interference: How Organized Crime Influences Professional
Football.''
   The New York Times's top attorney expressed confidence that the
suit would be thrown out of court and said the review was based
``on accurate facts.''
   The review by Times sportswriter Gerald Eskenazi said, in part,
that Moldea's book contains ``sloppy journalism'' as well as
``errors and unfounded insinuations.''
   The lawsuit alleges that the review ``was intended to protect
the NFL by personally attacking Moldea, discrediting his reputation
and smearing his good name as a careful investigative reporter.''
   ``The review gave false impressions through use of false and
misleading examples intended to injure Moldea's reputation, impeach
Moldea's honesty and integrity and destroyed the likelihood that
`Interference' would become a widely read book by the public,'' the
suit says.
   Moldea said in an interview that his publisher, William Morrow
and Co. Inc., had printed 33,000 copies of the book because initial
sales had been strong. But after The New York Times review came
out, sales dropped off precipitously, and only about 21,000 were
sold.
   ``This thing could have been stopped so long ago had they just
published a correction or my letter'' that countered, point by
point, statements in the review, Moldea said.
   Eskenazi declined comment on the matter, referring questions to
Times executives ``even though this is something I'm appalled at
when people do it to me.''
   The New York Times' senior attorney, George Freeman, said he had
not seen the lawsuit, but he was familiar with the case.
   ``We're totally convinced that the suit will be dismissed,''
Freeman said. A book review is ``protected opinion, particularly
where a review is based on accurate facts, as this one is.''
   Freeman, Moldea and the writer's attorney, Roger C. Simmons of
Frederick, Md., noted that Moldea had proposed a settlement of the
case that expired Thursday, but no one would disclose details of
the settlement offer.
   ``It's funny they didn't even wait until the deadline expired
before filing the suit,'' Freeman said.
   Other books by Moldea are ``Dark Victory: Ronald Reagan, MCA and
the Mob,'' which came out in 1986; ``The Hunting of Cain: A True
Story of Money, Greed and Fratricide,'' in 1983; and ``The Hoffa
Wars: Teamsters, Rebels, Politicians and the Mob,'' in 1978.

<HEAD>Angola Gov't Claims UNITA Rebels Killed 42</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUANDA, Angola (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angola's defense ministry said Thursday
that U.S.-backed UNITA rebels have killed 42 people and wounded 68
in six days of attacks.
   The ministry statement said the latest raid killed 22 people
Monday in Andulo, 300 miles southeast of Luanda in central Bie
province.
   It was not specified whether those killed in the Aug. 15-21
attacks were civilians or soldiers.
   The statement came one day after the official Jornal de Angola
newspaper reported the two sides in Angola's 15-year-old civil war
will meet next week in Portugal to search for a negotiated peace.
   According to the report, rebel and government delegations are to
open a third round of talks Monday.
   UNITA officials contacted in Lisbon, Portugal, and Portuguese
diplomats declined to confirm the date. But Portuguese foreign
ministry officials said the talks could begin before September.
   Portugal hosted direct negotiations between government and UNITA
delegations in April and June.
   Both sides have accused the other of delaying a third round of
talks.
   UNITA say they want recognition as an opposition force, and a
fixed date for multiparty elections before they will agree a
cease-fire.
   The government says a truce must come before political changes.
   UNITA, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola,
has been fighting to gain a share of control since 1975, when the
Marxist government came to power after Angola's independence from
Portugal.

   The federal government on Thursday
decided to shorten compulsory military service from 15 months to 12.
   The new regulation is to take effect Oct. 1, two days before
German unification.
   There has been intense pressure for such a move, with many
politicians saying defense expenditures should be cut to help
finance the costs of unifying with East Germany.
   Parliament still has to approve the decision, but it will likely
pass with ease.
   Military service is compulsory in West Germany starting at age
18.

<HEAD>House Leader Says Bush Should Brief Congress On Persian Gulf
Crisis</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Adds 3 grafs with Dole comment and trip planned</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee said Thursday that President Bush should explain his
intentions in the Persian Gulf to a joint session of Congress when
lawmakers return in two weeks.
   Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., said a host of issues need to be
addressed as the United States moves beyond the initial emergency.
   Among them, he said, is how the enormous military undertaking
will be financed and how the world community will pay its fair
share of the costs.
   ``Should it become necessary for the United States alone or
collectively to initiate military action in defense of our citizens
and interests, it is essential that the Congress be fully involved
in view of its constitutional responsibilities and that the
American people fully understand the reasons why its government
believes such a grave action has become necessary,'' Fascell said
in a statement released by his office.
   ``Iraq is holding thousands of our citizens hostage. This is an
intolerable situation. It is by no means clear, however, that
military action is the most effective way to deal with the
situation.''
   Fascell said he was not criticizing the president's actions so
far, but said, ``the time has come to deepen and broaden the
national dialogue on steps yet to be taken.''
   Congress returns from its summer recess Sept. 5.
   Rep. Bill Lowery, R-Calif., said Thursday that he would
introduce legislation to update the Soldiers' and Sailors' Relief
Act so members of the military reserves who are called into active
service during the Persian Gulf crisis aren't evicted from their
homes for not paying rent while serving.
   ``There is a provision that prevents a service member's family
from being evicted from their rental home or apartment while he or
she is serving,'' said Lowery. ``But it only applies if the rent is
less than $150 and only for three months.''
   He said he wanted to bring the law in line with today's economy.
He said he has asked the Defense Department for suggestions on
other changes in the law to modernize it.
   Lowery also said Army Secretary P.W. Stone has asked the House
Appropriations subcommittee on military construction to approve use
of $30 million in emergency funds to build a tent city in Saudi
Arabia.
   Lowery, who is the ranking Republican on the subcommittee, said
action will come as quickly as possible.
   Stone said he had approved the project ``to provide basic
shelter and sustainment facilities for the health, safety and
soldier support of personnel participating in Operation Desert
Shield.''
   Federal law gives the Army secretary authority to take such
emergency steps, but it requires congressional approval within 21
days.
   Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., said, meantime, that events in the
Persian Gulf illustrated the need to approve a bill he introduced
last year to establish a permanent world court for the prosecution
of internationally recognized crimes.
   He said Saddam Hussein's detaining of foreigners in Kuwait and
Iraq is criminal.
   ``When I introduced H.R. 3355 last year, no one anticipated the
situation we now face in Iraq,'' said Morrison. ``But that is
precisely why we need the kind of international criminal court that
my bill calls for _ to see to it that the rule of international law
has teeth.''
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said he and six other
GOP senators hope to meet with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarek in
Cairo during an 11-day trip to the Middle East and Eastern Europe
that begins Friday.
   ``I still believe Mubarak is the best hope (for resolving the
gulf standoff) as far as being an effective, strong leader,'' Dole
told reporters in Topeka, Kan. ``He still has pretty good ties with
Saddam Hussein.''
   The trip includes stops in Egypt, Bahrain, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria,
Romania, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union. Accompanying Dole
will be Sens. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, Alfonse D'Amato of New York,
Steve Symms of Idaho, Connie Mack of Florida, Jake Garn of Arizona
and John Warner of Virginia.

   A clandestine cocaine-processing
laboratory exploded in a coffee-growing region of southwestern
Colombia, killing five people and injuring four, police said
Thursday.
   The blast was apparantly caused by misuse of flammable chemicals
used to process cocaine, a police spokesman said in a telephone
interview.
   The explosion occurred last weekend, but police did not announce
it until Thursday.
   Meanwhile, security forces reinforced by three helicopters
uncovered a drug cache in northeastern Colombia on Thursday,
seizing 29 tons of marijuana, the police spokesman said.
   The marijuana was found packaged, apparently ready to be
smuggled abroad, he said. It was discovered in three underground
passageways.
   Police made no arrests during the raid, the spokeman said.

<TEXT>
   Exiled writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn, whose
Soviet citizenship was restored last week by Mikhail Gorbachev, has
rejected an invitation to visit his homeland, the Soviet news
agency Tass reported Thursday.
   In a letter sent Thursday to the Russian federation's prime
minister, Solzhenitsyn said it would be unthinkable for him to be a
guest or tourist in his native country, Tass said.
   ``When I return home it will be to live and to die there,'' he
said, according to the news agency.
   A call to Solzhenitsyn's secretary, Leonard Dilisio, went
unanswered Thursday night. Solzhenitsyn, who now lives with his
family in Cavendish, Vt., has consistently refused to talk to the
media.
   But on Aug. 17, Solzhenitsyn's wife, Natalia, released a
statement denying a Tass report that the 1970 Nobel laureate has
had high-level contacts with Soviet authorities and has agreed to
accept Soviet citizenship.
   ``During the 16{ years of our exile not a single representative
of the Soviet authorities has been in contact with Solzhenitsyn in
any form whatsoever,'' the statement said.
   She said her husband demands that expulsion orders and treason
charges against him be lifted and that all his books be printed and
widely distributed in the Soviet Union before he would consider
returning.
   In a letter published on the front pages of Soviet newspapers,
Russian Prime Minister Ivan Silayev urged Solzhenitsyn and his wife
to accept their restored citizenship and return home as Silayev's
guest.
   Solzhenitsyn, 71, was arrested for treason in February 1974,
forced onto a plane to Germany and stripped of his citizenship. His
wife lost her citizenship in 1977.
   His works include ``The Gulag Archipelago,'' about the horrors
of Josef Stalin's prison camps, ``One Day in the Life of Ivan
Denisovich,'' ``Cancer Ward'' and ``August 1914.''

<HEAD>Miners Call $52 Million Fine `Outrageous'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LEBANON, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge upheld $52 million in fines levied
against the United Mine Workers during a 10-month-long strike
against Pittston Coal Group Inc. by thousands of union members.
   Russell County Circuit Judge Donald McGlothlin Jr. ordered the
payments Wednesday although both Pittston and the UMW had filed a
joint motion to dismiss the fines after settling their strike Feb.
19.
   The walkout involved 1,200 striking miners in Virginia, West
Virginia and Kentucky.
   UMW leaders said Thursday they were reviewing McGlothlin's
ruling. They have appealed past orders to pay fines that were
levied against the union when its members violated orders
restricting pickets during the strike.
   McGlothlin agreed to dismiss $11.2 million in fines to
compensate Pittston for losses caused by union efforts to limit
coal production.
   He upheld the remaining $52 million owed to the state and to
Dickenson and Russell counties in Virginia, where most of the
strike action took place.
   UMW members said they were trying to put the strike behind them
when the ruling came.
   ``It brings back a lot of hard feelings,'' said electrician
James Gibbs of Bristol. He said he had hoped the judge would have
decided ``it took two sides to have the problems that we had.''
   Gibbs said McGlothlin may be biased against the union because
UMW leader Jackie Stump defeated Donald McGlothlin Sr., an
incumbent, in the Virginia House of Delegates election in November.
   ``We run a man against his daddy and beat him ... there might be
a little malice there,'' said Freeman Artrip, another union member.
   ``A lot of it is a vindictive thing,'' said Jack Kiser, who
works at Pittston's preparation plant in Russell County.
   McGlothlin said the election had no influence on his decision.
He said he anticipated a strong reaction after his ruling.
   ``I'm not geared as a judge ... to making my decisions on what
people might think,'' he said.
   McGlothlin said more legal action may be needed to compel the
union to comply with his orders.

<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Rep. Edward W. Pattison,
who as a freshman Democrat helped topple the blind seniority
structure in Congress, has died of liver cancer at age 58.
   Pattison, who died Wednesday, served in the House of
Representatives during 1975-1978.
   He was president of the 75 freshman Democrats of the ``Class of
94'' in the 94th Congress who, with other reform groups, succeeded
in revising several rules which had prevailed in Congress.
   Pattison also was manager of the comprehensive modernization and
reform of the federal Copyright Law enacted in 1976. He founded the
Congressional Institute on the Future and served as its chairman
until his death.
   A lawyer, he was a fellow at the John F. Kennedy School of
Government at Harvard University and taught public policy courses
at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Antioch-New England
Graduate School.
   Earlier this year Pattison received the Elihu Root-Henry L.
Stimson Award from the New York State Bar Association for community
service.
   Pattison is survived by his wife, Eleanor Copley Pattison, a
son, three daughters, mother and a brother.

<TEXT>
   A citywide police dragnet failed to snare the
elusive Zodiac gunman for the fourth time this summer Thursday, and
that could mean a sharp reduction in a 50-detective task force.
   Chief of Detectives Joseph Borrelli ``is evaluating the size of
the task force and a decision will come down sometime next week,''
said Police Department spokesman Sgt. Peter Sweeney.
   Borrelli told reporters Tuesday that a cut in the task force was
likely if the astrology-obsessed gunman failed to strike late
Wednesday or early Thursday, calling it, ``not a de-emphasis (on
the case) but a reduction.''
   The gunman, who began six letters to police and the media with
the phrase ``This is the Zodiac,'' has shot four men, killing one,
since March 8. In the rambling letters, he threatened to shoot
eight others, one for each astrological sign.
   Since the gunman's last attack on a homeless man sleeping on a
Central Park bench on June 21, the Zodiac has not written any new
letters to police or the media, or claimed any new victims.
   The task force released a sketch of a man wanted for
questioning, has interviewed close to 2,000 people and questioned
and released about a dozen suspects in the case.
   But calls to a 24-hour confidential hotline have trickled down
to two or three a day, and the case is being handled primarily as a
homicide investigation, the chief said.

<TEXT>
   The British producer of ``Miss Saigon'' plans to
meet with representatives of Actors' Equity next month in an effort
to settle remaining disputes and bring the $10 million production
to Broadway next April.
   ``Equity believes that a dialogue between the parties, rather
than further press releases, will prove to be salutary,'' said a
three-paragraph Equity statement Thursday. ``Perhaps through these
discussions `Miss Saigon' can move out of the press room and into
the rehearsal studio.''
   Marc Thibodeau, a spokesman for producer Cameron Mackintosh,
said the meeting had been set for the week after Labor Day.
Mackintosh will come to New York for the meeting, both sides said.
   ``Miss Saigon'' is a musical love story about an American
soldier during the final days of the Vietnam War in 1975.
   Equity, the actor's union, voted Aug. 7 to bar white actor
Jonathan Pryce from playing the part of a Eurasian pimp in the U.S.
production of the play, which is now on the London stage.
   But after Mackintoch canceled the production, which would be the
most expensive in Broadway history, the union's executive council
reversed itself last week and approved Pryce's role.
   Mackintosh said Equity's vote came without an understanding that
``artistic freedom of choice cannot be compromised,'' and said he
would not bring the musical here until his fears were assuaged.
Equity responded by inviting him to a meeting.
   Some actors in the Asian-American community were incensed by

   Moderates gathered Thursday to plot their revival
after more than a decade of waning influence in the
fundamentalist-dominated Southern Baptist Convention. They said
they hoped to avoid a split in the denomination.
   The opening session of the three-day meeting was marked by calls
for cooperation and trust within the convention. But the
fundamentalists were decried for having ``maligned and libeled good
and godly people.''
   An organizer of the meeting predicted it would take a miracle of
biblical proportions to reconcile the political differences between
the two Baptist factions.
   ``The only hope I can give you is that God parted the Red Sea,''
said the Rev. Daniel Vestal, pastor of Dunwoody Baptist Church in
Atlanta and a defeated candidate for the Southern Baptist
Convention presidency.
   Vestal said the meeting of 2,5000 disaffected Southern Baptists
had not been convened for the purpose of creating a new
denomination.
   ``The Southern Baptist institutions and missionary causes are
still very much viable as a whole,'' Vestal said. ``This group of
people here are tired of fighting fundamentalists.''
   Asked by a reporter if it would be wrong to interpret the
meeting as the first step toward an eventual break, Vestal said:
   ``I wouldn't tell you not to interpret it that way. I'm just
saying our intention is not to (split).''
   In an address to the gathering, Vestal said the meeting was
forced by ``a group of folks who have told us they don't want us to
work with them in the cause of Christ.''
   ``I have heard that the key to revival is brokenness,'' said
Vestal, who was defeated in June by conservative Texan Morris
Chapman for president of the convention. ``Well, if there ever was
a group of people who have experienced brokenness, it is us.''
   Over the last 12 years conservatives have gained increasing
control of the 14.9 million-member church, the largest Protestant
denomination in the nation. They believe in the inerrancy of the
Bible and contend that those who disagree are not true Christians.
The moderates advocate local church autonomy and want the
denomination to include those with diverse interpretations of the
Bible.
   Among the sessions scheduled at the ``Consultation of Concerned
Baptists'' meeting was a workshop on alternative funding.
   Group leaders are expected to consider a proposal to give
churches that are unhappy with the convention leadership's use of
its budget an ``optional delivery system'' for contributions to
mission programs.

   Diplomats and embassy employees pulled out of
Kuwait on Thursday, some obeying an Iraqi order to cease operations
and others defiantly leaving skeleton staffs behind.
   Iraq has declared that diplomats in Kuwait, invaded Aug. 2 by
Iraqi forces and subsequently annexed, would be treated like any
other foreigners after 9 p.m. Friday (1 p.m. EDT).
   Egypt took one of the strongest positions, announcing Thursday
that it would not close its embassy in Kuwait or reduce its staff
of 20.
   The United States, Japan, Switzerland, Austria and the 12
European Community nations were among those keeping reduced staffs
in place in the occupied oil kingdom.
   The Philippines, India and Lebanon were among those obeying the
closing order. Most of the world's nations faced no decision _ only
about 60 countries have embassies in Kuwait.
   The United States was evacuating some personnel from its embassy
in Kuwait but will leave Ambassador Nathaniel Howell and a small
staff behind. Contrary to an earlier report from White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, the Marine guard at the embassy was
withdrawn.
   ``A few Marine guards aren't going to fight off the entire Iraqi
army,'' a senior government official said in Washington.
   Kuwait government in exile has issued a statement ``rejecting
most firmly that illegal Iraqi call, which is a violation of all
international laws and norms.''
   Iraq's information minister warned foreign governments not to
try to keep their missions open.
   ``If they stay, they will be acting against our sovereignty.
That would be equivalent to an act of aggression,'' the French
daily newspaper Le Figaro quoted Latif Nassif Jassem as saying.
   Brazil, one of the few South American nations with an embassy in
Kuwait, said it had been closed temporarily for security reasons,
not in response to the Iraqi deadline.
   Venezuela's Foreign Ministry said it was seeking Iraqi
permission to evacuate its diplomatic staff from Baghdad as well as
Kuwait, along with about 45 Venezuelans in the two countries.
   Algeria has refused to recognize Iraq's annexation of Kuwait. A
diplomat in Algiers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he
expected the ``status quo'' at the embassy in Kuwait in coming days.
   Egypt and some Persian Gulf states had not announced a decision,
weighing fears for the safety of their diplomats against closing
their embassies and symbolically accepting Iraq's annexation of
Kuwait.
   ``There is little option for missions located in Kuwait but to
comply with the decision,'' India's Foreign Minister Inder Kumar
Gujral told Parliament.
   The Philippines announced that it would move its entire Kuwaiti
embassy staff to Baghdad. The government cited fears for the safety
of an estimated 90,000 Filipino workers in Kuwait and another 3,000
in Iraq.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh said Thursday
that he believed the Soviet charge d'affaires, the highest-ranking
officer, was still at the embassy in Kuwait.
   ``What will happen after the 24th, we'll inform you later,''
Gremitskikh said.
   Finland announced that it would not obey the Iraqi order, but
``temporarily vacated'' the embassy on Tuesday.
   ``We simply could not guarantee the safety of our personnel in
the embassy so we felt that it would be safer to move them out. But
I emphasize that we have not moved the embassy or closed it,'' said
Osmo Lipponen, a Finnish Foreign Ministry spokesman.

   A Colombian man reputed to be the mastermind
behind a scheme to launder more than $1 billion in illegal drug
profits for the Medellin drug cartel pleaded guilty to money
laundering charges in federal court Thursday.
   Eduardo Martinez-Romero entered his plea before U.S. District
Judge William C. O'Kelley.
   The early morning hearing was held without publicity and amid
tight security after the death of co-defendant Gustavo Gaviria, who
was killed Aug. 11 in a shootout with Colombian authorities.
   Martinez admitted to helping the cartel launder more than $1
billion through a nationwide operation know as ``The Mine.''
Federal authorities have said the operation at one time laundered
$4 million in three days through a storefront scheme in Atlanta.
   Martinez, Pablo Escobar, Gaviria and Geraldo Moncada were
indicted on March 29, 1989. Martinez was extradited to Atlanta last
Sept. 7, and was the first Colombian extradited to the U.S. since
cartel member Carlos Lehder.
   Martinez faces a maximum sentence of 30 years in jail without
parole and could face a $4 million fine.
   The plea was part of Operation Polar cap, a multi-agency
operation that U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh called the
largest money-laundering crackdown ever carried out by the federal
government.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Embassy said Wednesday it was
looking into a report that a large grain milling company in western
Kenya was forced to shut down after a visit by U.S. Ambassador
Smith Hempstone.
   The independent Nairobi newspaper The Standard said a government
official halted grain shipments to United Millers following a visit
by Hempstone to the company's plant in Kisumu on Aug. 11. The plant
employs 150 workers.
   Hempstone has come under strong attack for months by ranking
officials of Kenya's single, governing party, the Kenya African
National Union, and its daily newspaper, The Kenya Times of
Nairobi. Some urged his recall.
   The attacks began in May after Hempstone told a service club in
Nairobi that future U.S. aid to Kenya and other Third World nations
could be tied to their progress toward democracy.
   President Daniel arap Moi led high government and party
officials in complaining that the ambassador was trying to dictate
policy to them. The government has been under increasing criticism
recently for what opponents describe as corruption, cronyism and
authoritarian rule.
   Anti-government rioting in Kenya last month was reported to have
killed at least 28 people and injured scores. Anti-government
critics were detained.

<HEAD>Historical Society To Buy Theater Where Oswald Was Captured</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The movie theater where Lee Harvey Oswald was
captured following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy
has been saved from demolition.
   The Italian renaissance-style Texas Theatre was built by
billionaire Howard Hughes and opened in 1931.
   But the fate of the building had been in doubt since United
Artists Theatres Inc. closed it in December for financial reasons.
Many feared it would be sold and torn down to make way for some
other type of business.
   Instead, UA has agreed to sell it to the Texas Theatre
Historical Society for $175,000, Bob McElearney, president of the
Oak Cliff Chamber of Commerce, said Tuesday.
   The historical society has been negotiating with the company
since December.
   ``We came up with a deal that we both could live with,'' said
McElearney, who was asked by the society to handle the negotiations.
   Live performances and occasional screenings of classic movies
will once again become regular events at the theater, McElearney
said.
   The 1,350-seat theater will be run as a non-profit organization,
society president Dennis Hamilton said.
   The historical society so far has collected about $30,000 in
donations for the building's purchase and renovation, McElearney
said.
   Oswald was captured in the theater Nov. 22, 1963, only a few
hours after Kennedy was shot to death on a Dallas street. People
had chased him into the theater after he was seen running away from
the area where police officer J.D. Tippit was slain.
   The Warren Commission identified Oswald as the lone assassin of
the president, saying Oswald fired the fatal shots from his perch
in the Texas Schoolbook Depository Building.
   Oswald was shot to death by Dallas nightclub operator Jack Ruby
two days later.

<TEXT>
   Marauding gunmen killed at least 17
Indian immigrants in this ethnically troubled port city on
Wednesday and wounded others, Pakistan's state news agency reported.
   No one claimed responsibility and police refused to speculate.
   Police said the men fired on brightly colored booths set up by
immigrants preparing for Thursday's return to Karachi of their
political leader, Altaf Hussein. Hussein has been in London
receiving medical treatment.
   ``There are about 50 people in the hospitals with gunshot
wounds,'' said a member of Hussein's militant Mohajir Qami
Movement, which represents Indians who migrated to Pakistan
following the end of British rule in 1947.
   The member spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   Nazim Nasir, another member of the Movement, said of Hussein's
scheduled return, ``We expect more than 1 million people to come
out. We are worried about tomorrow and our central committee is
meeting but what are we to do?'' For years, Karachi, a city of 9
million people, has been an urban battlefield between ethnic and
political rivals.
   President Ghulam Ishaq Khan dismissed Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto's government two weeks ago. One reason he cited was its
inability to stop the killings.

   ``Diff'rent Strokes'' star Todd Bridges was
acquitted Thursday of assault in the shooting of a narcotics dealer
at a drug den. It was the second trial clearing the actor of
criminal charges.
   Bridges, 25, looked up and breathed a heavy sigh after the
Superior Court jury announced its verdict.
   ``I feel a lot of relief that it's over,'' Bridges said outside
court.
   Bridges, who played Gary Coleman's brother Willis on the NBC
series for eight years, faced a retrial in the February 1989
point-blank shooting of convicted drug dealer Kenneth ``Tex'' Clay.
   In the first trial, jurors acquitted Bridges of attempted
murder, but deadlocked on the assault charge. Prosecutors decided
to retry Bridges on a charge of assault with a deadly weapon.
   Deputy District Attorney William Hodgman contended that Bridges
shot Clay several times at a south-central Los Angeles drug house
because Clay allegedly stole the actor's BMW.
   Clay recovered from the gunshot wounds to his arms and chest.
   The prosecution said Bridges admitted to the attack as he was
being booked by police.
   But defense attorney Johnnie Cochran argued his client was in
the middle of a four-day cocaine binge during the attack at the
drug den, and that someone else shot Clay.
   The jury deliberated for three days, spending much of Wednesday
reviewing the testimony of two key prosecution witnesses who
claimed to have seen Bridges with a gun shortly before the shooting.
   ``The evidence was lacking in this case,'' said Cochran. ``We
proved that Todd Bridges did not do the shooting.''
   But Deputy District Attorney William Hodgman said jurors may
have been influenced by Bridges' fame from appearances in the
situation comedies ``Diff'rent Strokes'' and ``Fish.'' After
announcing the verdict, at least one juror asked for Bridges'
autograph.
   ``When you have a celebrity defendant, the normal rules don't
apply and I think that's what happened here,'' Hodgman said.
   In his closing argument, Cochran blamed the shooting on Bridge's
former co-defendant, Harvie Duckett, who had pleaded guilty to an
accessory charge and was promised leniency for his testimony.
   Cochran said Bridges, an actor since age 6, was actually a
victim in the case, a cocaine addict who fell prey to violent drug
users.

   The Bush administration pulled
Marine guards and most diplomats out of the threatened U.S. Embassy
in Kuwait on Thursday, but left the ambassador and a skeleton staff
behind in defiance of Saddam Hussein's eviction order.
   ``A few Marine guards aren't going to fight off the entire Iraqi
army,'' a senior White House official said. ``We don't want to put
American lives at unnecessary danger.''
   With Iraq's Friday deadline looming for foreign embassies to
close their doors in Kuwait City, the White House said publicly it
had evacuated non-essential personnel from the embassy.
   Administration officials said privately that all but about a
dozen of the 120 Americans at the embassy had left for Baghdad,
where U.S. officials expected to fly them out of Iraq.
   The group reached Baghdad about 1 a.m. local time Friday (5 p.m.
EDT Thursday) in a 33-car caravan after a trip that took more than
19 hours, said a senior U.S. official in Washington who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   However, another official said, one woman traveling with the
group was injured when two of the cars collided at the start of the
trip and had to be left at a Kuwait City hospital.
   The deadline imposed by Iraq for closing the embassy initially
was given to the United States in a diplomatic note as noon local
time (4 a.m. EDT) on Friday, the senior official said. But
subsequently Iraq has said the deadline is midnight (4 p.m. EDT)
Friday, the official said.
   The Iraqi state news agency, by contrast, set the deadline at 9
p.m. local time (1 p.m. EDT).
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater initially indicated the
embassy's Marine security guards would probably stay ``as long as
the ambassador's there.''
   But he later issued a written statement saying: ``Contrary to
earlier information, there are no U.S. Marines at the U.S. Embassy
in Kuwait. The Marines departed with the convoy, which is en route
to Baghdad.''
   Also on Thursday:
   _President Bush looked to the United Nations to put military
muscle behind its sanctions against Iraq. Spokesman Fitzwater said,
``We are in this to the end.''
   _At the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney approved plans
to call 10,000 military reservists to active duty over the next
week and nearly 50,000 by the end of September to support the
massive deployment of U.S. troops, ships and warplanes to the
Persian Gulf. Many of the reserves themselves will be heading for
the gulf area.
   _State Department spokesman Richard Boucher denounced as
``shameful theater'' Saddam's television appearance in Baghdad with
British children and others who have not been allowed to leave the
area.
   Fitzwater said Ambassador Nathaniel Howell and the skeleton
staff at the Kuwait embassy were staying behind to help some 2,500
trapped Americans _ Saddam calls them ``guests'' though he will not
let them leave _ who were in Kuwait when Iraq's tanks overran it
three weeks ago.
   About half the Americans at the embassy before the partial
evacuation were diplomatic personnel and half were dependents,
including nearly 30 children, the State Department said.
   The diplomats ``will remain as long as there are Americans that
they can assist,'' said Fitzwater, briefing reporters at a seaside
hotel near Bush's vacation home.
   Boucher, asked why Howell was staying, said simply, ``He's
captain of the ship.''
   Bush indicated at a news conference Wednesday that he was
willing to give the United Nations ``a little time'' to decide how
to stop Iraqi ships before ordering U.S. warships to do the job.
   Fitzwater said talks were going on at the U.N. among the five
permanent members of the Security Council _ the United States,
Great Britain, China, the Soviet Union and France _ ``on a possible
resolution to enforce the sanctions.'' The Soviets have raised
objections to a draft British resolution that would specifically
authorize military action to enforce the embargo.
   ``We are still following the situation continuously. We are ...
following the tankers in the gulf and continue to work with the
U.N.,'' said Fitzwater.
   ``We are in this to the end and we are determined to see it
through,'' Fitzwater said.
   In Washington, Boucher scolded the Soviet Union for keeping
military advisers in Iraq and suggested Moscow may be in violation
of United Nations sanctions.
   ``It is inappropriate to provide any form of military assistance
to Iraq,'' the State Department spokesman said. ``We believe U.N.
sanctions extend to the provision of services to Iraq.''
   But the White House refrained from such criticism.
   Fitzwater said Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze had
assured Secretary of State James A. Baker III that the Soviets were
trying to get all their advisers and other citizens out of Iraq.
   The Soviets' stand against Iraq ``has been enormously helpful in
terms of the latitude that's been given for all the countries of
the world to pursue their opposition to this ggressor,'' Fitzwater
said.
   On Jordan's decision to close its border with Iraq against a
flood of refugees, Fitzwater said, ``We do understand the Jordanian
predicament'' and the United States stands ready to help.
   But he also said the United States will hold King Hussein ``to
his pledge to abide by the sanctions.'' Bush ``was very firm with
him'' when they met here last week ``and that has not changed.''
   The United States also will hold Yemen to its promise not to
unload a tanker filled with Iraqi oil that was allowed to reach a
Yemeni port, Fitzwater said.
   Bush stayed out of the public eye Thursday, boating with Brent
Scowcroft, his national security adviser, and planning to attend a
closed-door Republican fund-raiser Thursday evening in nearby Cape
Porpoise for New Hampshire Gov. Judd Gregg and for David Emery, a
congressional candidate here in Maine.
   This was the 14th day of Bush's planned 25-day vacation, which
has repeatedly been interrupted by crisis planning. Bush summoned
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, budget director Richard Darman
and other aides for a luncheon meeting Friday to discuss the
federal budget deficit, made worse by the gulf crisis and the
soaring price of oil.
   Fitzwater denied there has been much criticism from the public
about Bush's vacationing during the crisis.
   ``We hear more and more from people who are saying, `You are
doing just the right thing, Mr. President. Stay with it,''' said
Fitzwater,
   ``Being at Kennebunkport helps give him a little distraction and
get a little of the rest that he's going to need, we all are going
to need, as we proceed through this in the next weeks before us,''
he said.

<HEAD>Report Wall Built in Albania's Embassy Quarter</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Authorities in Tirana are building a wall
around the embassy quarter, where about 5,000 Albanians sought
asylum last month, Western business executives who visited the
Albanian capital this week said Wednesday.
   The business people, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
metal barriers block the only road into the quarter and police are
posted around the area.
   Asylum-seekers crashed through gates and scaled embassy compound
walls in their desperation to emigrate.
   A spokesman for a U.S. congressional delegation that visited
Tirana this week confirmed in a telephone interview in Prague,
Czechoslovakia, that a wall was being built around the entire
embassy quarter.
   The spokesman, who also spoke on condition of not being
identified, said the top of the wall was being lined with broken
chunks of rock and mortar.
   The businessmen said brick walls one foot to 16 inches thick are
being erected around the embassies, and are already about 10 feet
high in places.
   Albania is the last holdout in East Europe against democratic
reforms, symbolized by the tearing down of the Berlin Wall that
divided East and West for 28 years.
   The nation's Communist leadership introduced new regulations in
July allowing all Albanians to own a passport for travel abroad.
However, most Albanians do not have access to the hard currency
they would need to travel.
   Many of those who took refuge in embassies and were later
permitted to emigrate complained of low living standards and
repression under the Communists.
   The rush on the embassies embarrassed the Tirana leadership at a
time when it is aggressively seeking to cultivate ties abroad.
   Albanian leader Ramiz Alia has begun to introduce economic
reforms in an effort to improve supplies of basic goods and
services and raise living standards for Albania's 3 million people.

   The United States and Britain charged
Thursday that Iraq was violating the U.N. economic embargo by
trying to ship oil worldwide and buy arms on the open market and
black market.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering said he hoped airing of the
accusations would clear the way for the Security Council to adopt a
resolution authorizing military action to enforce the embargo.
   The Soviet Union has said it needs clear evidence of violations
of the embargo against Iraq before approving international military
enforcement of the sanctions. The Soviet envoy declined to say if
he was persuaded by the evidence.
   The United States and Britain presented their case at an
informal meeting of the Security Council sanctions committee,
attended by all council members. They presented photographs of
tankers they said were violating the sanctions, and a photo of a
battle tank said to have been imported illegally.
   Libya also was accused of helping Iraq try to break the arms
embargo, diplomats in attendance said later.
   On Aug. 6, to punish Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait, the
Security Council imposed an embargo on all trade with Iraq except
medical supplies and, in special humanitarian circumstances, food.
   ``Iraq is known to be breaking the embargo,'' Pickering said.
   ``We are also talking about many efforts by Iraq to illegally
import many different commodities _ arms, machinery, steel _ from
the open market, black market, gray market, green market, any
market,'' Pickering told reporters.
   ``We are talking about lots of ships and many miles in these
violations,'' Pickering said. ``Iraq is sending ships to export oil
all over the world.''
   Cuban Ambassador Ricardo Alarcon displayed photocopies of the
pictures and ridiculed them as evidence. He said the United States
and Britain appeared to be ``whipping up a war-like hysteria.''
   ``Why are some people apparently so eager to go to war and
mislead public opinion?'' Alarcon asked. ``Nobody has provided any
evidence that the embargo is not working.''
   Later, Iraqi Ambassador Abdul Amir Al-Anbari said the sanctions
were one-sided and imposed under pressure from ``one or two
superpowers.''
   ``We believe there is no need to worsen the situation by
resorting to the use of force,'' he said.``This problem could be
solved diplomatically.''
   Earlier Thursday, a Soviet envoy said political and diplomatic
efforts should be given more time to defuse the gulf crisis before
the U.N. Security Council permits navies to use force to halt all
shipping to and from Iraq.
   Soviet Ambassador Valentin V. Lozinskiy also told reporters that
there was no breakthrough or accord on a proposed U.S. resolution
authorizing ``minimum force'' to police the embargo against Iraq.
   He spoke after an informal meeting by the five permanent members
of the Security Council _ the United States, the Soviet Union,
Britain, China and France.
   Pickering had told reporters, ``We agreed on a text to send to
capitals, and we will continue our consultations.''
   ``We are going to have a vote as soon as it can be arranged,''
he said.''
   Pickering and U.S. officials later denied there was any
disagreement between Pickering and Lozinskiy about whether the text
had been accepted by the five governments. The only agreement, they
said, was to send a text to the capitals of the five powers for
further consideration.
   No Security Council meeting has been scheduled.
   Lozinskiy said there could be a Security Council meeting this
week, but not Thursday.
   When asked about a breakthrough, he said: ``Hopefully,
hopefully. It takes time. Not today.''
   President Bush said Wednesday he wanted the Security Council's
blessing to use force to halt Iraq's shipping, but said the United
States already has the right to enforce a U.N. embargo on trade
with Iraq.
   U.S. officials contend the United States is authorized to
enforce the embargo at the request of the ousted Kuwaiti
government, and by the U.N. Charter's specific language granting
nations the right to self-defense.
   U.S. officials have said they would not call a meeting of the
full 15-member Security Council unless they have approval of the
five permanent members, or a promise not to veto the U.S.
initiative.

   An influential state representative
resigned Thursday and a judge was suspended as a grand jury
investigating widespread bribe-taking at the House of
Representatives neared the completion of its work.
   U.S. Attorney Bart Daniel scheduled a news conference at the
General Assembly on Friday, and there was speculation the grand
jury would announce indictments.
   House Speaker Bob Sheheen, a Democrat, has said he expects as
many as 10 lawmakers to be indicted.
   Rep. Robert Brown, a Democrat who chaired the Labor, Commerce
and Industry Committee, notified Sheheen of his resignation in a
letter Thursday. The 34-year-old businessman had been a
representative since 1983.
   ``I hope my work and dedication to improving the quality of life
in my county and our state will not be totally overshadowed by any
mistakes I have made,'' Brown wrote. ``I regret any appearance of
impropriety and any negative reflection on the House of
Representatives or the citizens of Marion County.''
   Neither Brown nor his attorney, Cam Littlejohn, would comment
further.
   Circuit Judge Tee Ferguson, who served in the House of
Representatives for six years until his election to judge this
spring, sent in a resignation letter Wednesday.
   He asked chief Justice George Gregory to suspend him ``until
such time as the matter concerning alleged votes for cash is
resolved in so far as it seeks to implicate me.''
   Neither Brown nor Ferguson has been charged with any crime.
   Two other lawmakers, Republican Reps. Bob Kohn and Tom
Limehouse, previously have announced they were withdrawing from the
fall election. Kohn has claimed he was assisting in the
investigation.
   Sources have said the FBI set up a sting operation in which
former House member-turned lobbyist Ron Cobb offered lawmakers cash
in exchange for votes on legislation that would have legalized
pari-mutuel betting in South Carolina.
   Brown's committee approved that legislation in 1989.
   In late July, shortly after news of the investigation broke,
Brown filed an amended campaign report which disclosed that he had
received $2,500 cash from Cobb, who actually was an undercover
agent. The reports were due in June.
   At the time, Brown denied he took the money in exchange for his
service or his vote. ``I've never taken a dime with strings
attached,'' he said.

   George and Alma Morton, worrying
about their son and his family trapped in Kuwait, looked up from
their supper Thursday evening to see their grandson Ian standing
with Saddam Hussein on the TV news.
   ``We both just jumped for joy,'' Mrs. Morton said. ``It was a
miracle.''
   Eleven-year-old Ian Morton, in shorts, a print shirt and
eyeglasses, stood quietly through most of the film as the Iraqi
president tried to talk with a younger boy, identified only as
Stuart.
   The Iraqi film, broadcast on British television, moved to the
Mortons' son Steven and his wife, Patricia, both 37, and to Ian's
brothers, Gary, 15, and Craig, 13. Then Pat Morton put in a plea
that their families back in England be notified they are all right.
   Another British family shown with Saddam in the Iraqi film was
identified by the London newspaper The Daily Telegraph as Dale
Pilkington, his wife Michelle and their two children.
   The family's relatives live at Weymouth in southwest England.
   Pilkington's brother, Wade Pilkington, told the paper: ``I can't
imagine he would have been happy being used as a pawn.''
   On the film, Patricia Morton told the Iraqi president: ``We
realize that we are in an unknown destination, we realize that. Our
families know we are in an unknown destination. But we would like
them to know we are fit and well. Our parents are old, my husband
and mine, and in ill health.''
   Back home in the northeast England village of New Marske, the
message went straight to people who were worrying most.
   ``That's Pat,'' said Alma Morton, 66. ``She would really tell
him. ... If the boys were in trouble it wouldn't be my son who'd go
out, it would be her. She would sort it out, wouldn't she?'' she
asked her husband. ``She's that type of lady.''
   George Morton, 68, told the Independent Television News: ``It
came as a great relief to see them looking reasonably well on
television tonight, although naturally we are concerned about their
present situation.''
   In later film, shown by the British Broadcasting Corp., Ian was
interviewed separately and said he played football and volleyball
and watched TV.
   The family went to Kuwait 10 weeks ago after Steven Morton took
a job as a safety officer with an American company. Their family in
England had tried unsuccessfully to get information about them in
the tense weeks since Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2 and annexed it.
   ``We will not be happy until we see them safely back home
again,'' Alma Morton said. ``We appeal to President (Saddam)
Hussein to send them back and to let go all the other people being
held.
   ``The children looked happy and Steve was smiling. ... Now we
just want them home with us.''

<HEAD>Swiss Bank Agrees to Provide Financial Records to Noriega
Attorneys</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MILT SOSIN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Swiss bank agreed to provide records demanded by
attorneys for Manuel Noriega to track money for his legal defense,
but a German bank declined, a federal judge was told Thursday.
   Noriega's attorneys, who have estimated it could cost $5 million
to defend the ousted Panamanian dictator on drug trafficking
charges, are trying to track millions of dollars believed held in
foreign banks.
   The U.S. government has agreed up to $6 million of Noriega's
money should be available to the defense, but left it to his
attorneys to track it down.
   The Union Bank of Zurich, Switzerland, is complying with the
records request, said bank attorney John D. Lovi of the New York
law firm of Sullivan and Cromwell and assistant U.S. Attorney Myles
Malman.
   The records of the account were turned over by the bank to the
Swiss government, and under the terms of an international treaty
that government turned them over to the U.S. government, Lovi told
U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler.
   Malman told the judge that the Justice Department is expected to
turn this material over to Noriega attorney Frank Rubino, and a
subpoena has been withdrawn.
   The prosecutor said Deutsh Sudamerkanische Bank of Hamburg,
Germany, has declined a request to turn over records on the account.
   ``The account, upon best information and belief, is in the name
of the Banco Nacional of Panama, which may have its own rights and
interest in the account,'' according to prosecution documents.
``The United States has none, and takes no position whether
DSB-Hamburg should be compelled to comply with Noriega's subpoena.''
   Bank attorney Barry Hunter said the bank ``does not have a
Noriega account.'' He said the account was opened in 1988, a year
before the dispute between the current government and Noriega.
   He said by invoking a certain legal procedure, Noriega's
attorneys could obtain the information in 30 to 60 days, but they
have said that would take too long.
   Rubino has said he wants to find out how much money is still in
the account and where the money has gone.
   Bank Lyonnaise of Marseille, France, has also been asked to turn
over records.
   Federal Magistrate William Turnoff said Aug. 2 that the banks
must comply with subpoenas to supply records to the defense.
   It was the first time that a federal court has backed a private
litigant's request to examine usually secret foreign bank records,
Rubino said then.
   Ramon Anzola, who said he represented the Panamanian government,
told the judge that even if defense attorneys find the money, the
funds should not be paid to Noriega.
   Panama is filing a $5.3 billion racketeering suit against
Noriega aimed at collecting funds it says belong to the people of
Panama.
   Rubino has said Noriega's money, estimated at more than $20
million, is deposited in about six European countries. The defense
has claimed that Noriega earned much of the money legally,
including as an informant for U.S. intelligence agencies, so it was
unfair for the United States to freeze his access to all his
accounts. Noriega has had no way of monitoring the accounts since
his arrest.
   Noriega is being held in a jail outside Miami awaiting trial on
charges he took $4.6 million in bribes to protect the Colombian
cocaine trade.

   A state agency's request that public-aid
employees take unused soap bars and shampoo bottles from hotels and
motels and save them for the homeless has the hotel industry
foaming.
   A division of the state Department of Public Aid has adopted a
policy asking its workers to contribute voluntarily. An agency-wide
policy might be next, Kathleen Kustra, the department's director,
said Tuesday.
   ``It is something we want to look at,'' Mrs. Kustra said. ``One
division has sent out a notice that it will act as a collection
point if people want to do that.''
   But the Hotel-Motel Association of Illinois objected, and said a
better policy might be to ask the hotels for contributions.
   ``Where would you draw the line?'' asked Arnold Karr, the
association's executive director. ``The next thing that will be
taken will be the other amenities: glasses, towels, bath mats,
throw rugs and furniture.''

   A private airplane crashed on takeoff and burned
at Houston Intercontinental Airport on Thursday, killing three men
and injuring 12 others, officials said.
   The twin-engine Grumman G-159 turboprop, carrying employees of
Houston-based Rowan Drilling Co., crashed at 5:21 p.m. about a mile
south of the airport's main terminal complex, said airport
supervisor Frank Haley. The airplane had been headed for New
Orleans.
   The fuselage was torn nearly in half and a fire scorched
sections of the aircraft.
   ``When we were taking off, it was turning and turning and the
next thing I knew, the plane was on the ground,'' said passenger
Patrick Michael Duran, 33, of Meridan, Miss., who suffered a
sprained arm.
   ``The last thing I said when we were going down was, `God help
me,' and I believe He did,'' said passenger Edward Odom, 28,
Stonewall, Miss., who walked away from the wreck with scratches on
one hand.
   Two of the injured men were airlifted to Hermann Hospital, while
10 others were taken by ambulance to other hospitals, Haley said.
Three, including Odom and Duran, were treated and released; the
others were hospitalized in conditions ranging from stable to good,
hospital officials said.
   Odom and Duran said they were returning from a regular two-week
tour of duty at oil rigs in the North Sea. They and their fellow
Rowan Drilling employees had just arrived on a British Airways
flight from London and were continuing to Louisiana and Mississippi
on the private plane.
   ``We're trying to ascertain who was on the aircraft,'' said
Rowan Drilling Vice President Robert Coryle. ``We believe they all
were employees.''
   The three dead were all in the cockpit and were believed to be
the plane's three crewmen, said Harris County Assistant Medical
Examiner Jay Evans. The names of the dead were not immediately
available.
   ``Everybody else is going to make it,'' Evans said.
   It was unclear whether some of the injured escaped the wreckage
on their own or whether all were rescued by firefighters.
   Evans said the aircraft appeared to be taking off in a
north-to-south direction, but it was unclear whether the aircraft
had become airborne before it crashed.
   J.H. Lynn, a Houston police accident investigator, said it
appeared to him that the plane skidded from the runway, crossed a
grassy median and then a taxiway before crashing and burning.
   Companies from about four other fire departments were dispatched
to the airport, said airport firefighter M.G. McClelland.
   As night fell, workers moved in portable lights while police and
other emergency vehicles ringed the area.
   Pieces of propeller littered the taxiway and a small patch of
grass near the aircraft was blackened. Remnants of firefighting
foam were scattered about.
   The plane was virtually broken in half. The left wing was burned
away and all that remained of the left engine was a skeletal shell.
   The runway involved was closed briefly, but airport operations
were not otherwise affected, said airport spokesman Hoyt Brown.

   The stage was set for a showdown in occupied Kuwait over Iraq's
order that embassies close their doors Friday, and Saddam Hussein
drove home his readiness to play the hostage card as the Persian
Gulf crisis entered its fourth week.
   The Bush administration on Thursday pulled Marine guards and
most diplomats out of the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait, but left
Ambassador Nathaniel Howell and a skeleton staff behind in defiance
of Saddam's eviction order. Deadline time was 9 p.m. (1 p.m. EDT)
Friday, according to the Iraqi News Agency, but diplomats in
Washington said that time had been extended three hours to midnight.
   In scenes shown Thursday on Iraqi television, Saddam put foreign
captives on display, ruffling the hair of one little boy and joking
with the tense and uncomfortable-looking group.
   The Iraqi president strongly suggested the foreigners' fate
depends on the outcome of the standoff. The State Department called
it ``shameful theatrics'' and British Foreign Secretary Douglas
Hurd called the display ``the most sickening thing I've seen for a
long time.''
   About 21,000 Westerners, including 3,000 Americans, were trapped
in Iraq and Kuwait by Iraq's Aug. 2 conquest of the New
Jersey-sized emirate. Now Saddam seeks to cut their lifeline in
Kuwait _ foreign diplomatic missions.
   The United States, Japan, Switzerland, Austria and the 12
European Community nations were among those keeping embassies open,
with reduced staffs. The Philippines, India and Lebanon said they
would close their embassies. Only about 60 countries have embassies
in Kuwait.
   Baghdad said keeping embassies open would be an ``act of
aggression.''
   The crisis was shaking world financial markets.
   The Dow industrial average fell 76.73 points on Thursday to
2,483.42, its lowest in more than a year and 17 percent below the
July 17 peak. The dollar kept on declining. The Tokyo stock market
registered its fourth-biggest drop ever Thursday but was up 2.88
percent in early trading Friday.
   Oil prices shot to a seven-year high of more than $32 a barrel.
Crude prices have surged nearly 50 percent since Aug. 2. The
Thursday close on the New York Mercantile Exchange was $31.93 per
42-gallon barrel.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir warned that the gulf
crisis was ``mounting toward a peak.''
   The United States tried to add some teeth to U.N. sanctions
imposed to punish Iraq for the invasion. U.S. Ambassador Thomas R.
Pickering said Thursday the five permanent members of the Security
Council tentatively agreed on wording of a measure allowing use of
military force to enforce the sanctions.
   More U.S. troops and equipment poured into the region,
bolstering the biggest American military effort since Vietnam. The
newspaper of Iraq's ruling party spoke ominously Thursday of
``flooding the Arabian desert with the blood of American soldiers.''
   Saddam's elite Republican Guards, which led the attack into
Kuwait, are being replaced on the front lines of his defenses by
other troops, an intelligence source in Washington said Thursday.
   ``They're withdrawing the Republican Guard to positions behind
the front lines,'' said the source, who has access to intelligence
information and spoke on condition of anonymity.
   NBC News reported intelligence reports showed that thousands of
the guards, perhaps more than 50,000, were heading from the Saudi
border.
   The source said Saddam's troops were involved in a ``classically
Soviet'' military maneuver and that they retained the ability to
attack on short notice, within eight to 12 hours.
   U.S. forces make up the bulk of a multinational army protecting
oil-rich Saudi Arabia since Kuwait was invaded. Iraq had accused
Kuwait of cheating on its OPEC production levels, thus driving down
world oil prices and depriving Iraq of vital oil revenue. It also
claimed Kuwait stole oil from a field that includes land both sides
claim.
   The Pentagon said Thursday that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
had approved plans to call up to 49,700 military reservists to
active duty. Some members of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Coast
Guard reserve forces could get the call as early as Friday, it said.
   A series of Iraqi moves graphically demonstrated Saddam's
willingness to use the trapped foreigners to try to pressure their
governments to halt sanctions and send home the troops.
   The most dramatic was a broadcast showing English-speaking
adults and children gathered in an office, where Saddam told them:
``Your presence here and other other places is meant to prevent the
scourge of war.''
   That was an apparent reference to Iraq's stated intention to use
trapped foreigners as human shields for key Iraqi installations.
   Polish workers arriving home from Iraq told the newspaper Gazeta
Wyborcza that last week, as they left the Iraqi chemical factory
where they had been working, about three dozen Americans arrived
under guard.
   The nationalities of those shown on TV were not immediately
known, except a 11-year-old boy from Britain, but others spoke with
British accents. About 4,500 Britons are in Iraq and Kuwait.
   Also Thursday, Japan's Foreign Ministry said about 245 Japanese
had been flown from Kuwait and put under virtual house arrest in
Baghdad. The move came as Japan debates measures to help enforce
the U.N. embargo.
   A senior White House official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Thursday at President Bush's vacation home at
Kennebunkport, Maine, about the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait: ``A few
Marine guards aren't going to fight off the entire Iraqi army. We
don't want to put American lives at unnecessary danger.''
   The palm-shaded U.S. Embassy complex on Arabian Gulf Boulevard
is heavily fortified with concrete barriers and steel spikes
installed after a suicide bombing in December 1983 destroyed the
embassy's three-story administrative annex.
   Administration officials said privately that all but about a
dozen of the 120 Americans at the Kuwaiti embassy reached Baghdad
early Friday in a 33-car caravan after a 19-hour trip. U.S.
officials expected to fly them out of Iraq.
   However, one woman traveling with the group was injured when two
of the cars collided at the start of the trip and had to be left at
a Kuwait City hospital, the officials said, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   Unidentified Iraqi sources told ABC News the embassies that
stayed open past the deadline would be surrounded by troops, who
may prevent food from going into the buildings.
   In other developments:
   _An Israeli civil defense official Thursday urged citizens to
stock up on food, tape their windows shut and mix a homemade
antidote to defend against a possible Iraqi chemical attack.
   _Saddam called on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to abandon
his support for Western forces protecting Saudi Arabia. In a
statement read on Iraqi television Thursday, Saddam called for Arab
unity and said those who failed to fully support it did not deserve
to lead.
   _A pair of U.N. envoys wrapped up talks in Iraq on the captive
foreigners, but there was little indication they met with any
success. Iraqi Foreign Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz told the two the
U.N. Security Council had become ``an American tool,'' the Iraqi
News Agency reported.
   _Jordan delayed implementing an announcement it would close its
borders Thursday to the thousands of foreigners _ mainly Arabs _
making their way out of Iraq. Thousands more crossed Thursday into
Jordan.
   _Commercial traffic in and out of Iraq via Jordan also continued
Thursday, in violation of the U.N. sanctions.
   _Jordan's King Hussein arrived Thursday in Sudan on a tour of
Arab capitals aimed at finding a diplomatic solution to the crisis.

   The Persian Gulf crisis reached into homes, offices and
factories on Main Street U.S.A. as President Bush announced he was
calling up the military reserves. Like firefighters, many
reservists said they were ready for the call.
   ``My bags have been packed for the last two weeks,'' said Kevin
Hermening of Mosinee, Wis., a sergeant in the Marine Reserve who at
20 was the youngest of the 52 Americans held hostage in the U.S.
Embassy in Iran a decade ago.
   The call-up Wednesday takes men and women from their homes and
jobs to serve on active duty for the first time since the Vietnam
War.
   About 40,000 Army, Navy and Air Force reservists are expected to
be activated to bolster the U.S. buildup in the gulf, which was
prompted by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait three weeks ago.

   The Bush administration is concerned that the
Soviet Union is still providing military advisers to Iraq, but the
Soviets insist the advisers have not aided in any combat
operations, U.S. officials say.
   And yet, the officials said, the Soviets gave a similar account
of their advisers during Iraq's eight-year Persian Gulf war with
Iran although Soviet advisers were observed near battlefield sites.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
subject did not come up in Secretary of State James A. Baker III's
telephone conversation Wednesday with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   But they said the United States had registered its concern in
the past. The Soviets replied that the advisers had not assisted in
combat operations and said there was no evidence they had, the
officials said.
   On Wednesday, Col. Valentin Ogurtsov said in Moscow that 193
unarmed military experts were finishing their ``contractual
obligations'' to show Iraqis how to use tanks, jet fighters and
missiles, and to maintain and repair the hardware.

   East Germany's chaotic young democracy agreed
early today to abolish the country in less than six weeks and turn
the territory over to its rich Western neighbor.
   After an 11-hour debate, lawmakers overcame a damaging political
feud and voted overwhelmingly to unify with West Germany on Oct. 3
_ nearly one breathtaking year after the hard-line Communist
government was toppled.
   The lawmakers also approved an election treaty with West Germany
that will allow Germans in both nations to elect a single
government on Dec. 2 for the first time in nearly 60 years.
   West Germany's Parliament was to consider the treaty later
today, and swift passage was expected.

   The National Endowment for the Arts is
creating a special watchdog panel to investigate complaints from
``any reliable source'' that grant recipients are violating the law
by using federal funds to produce obscene art.
   Plans for the panel were disclosed in a letter from NEA general
counsel Julianne Ross Davis to the lawyer for the American Poetry
Review, a Philadelphia-based literary magazine that subsequently
rejected a $10,000 endowment grant over the obscenity issue.
   The three editors of the 24,000-circulation publication said
they found the NEA's obscenity guidelines ``restraining and
damaging to the process of selecting material for the magazine, as
well as to poets and writers.''
   Ms. Davis told the magazine in late July that the panel would
include herself, a deputy NEA chairman and program specialists in
theater, literature and other arts disciplines. The panel will
``make initial determinations with respect to allegations of
obscenity'' based on ``a complaint from any reliable source,'' she
said.

   Smokers angry over a cigarette shortage blocked a
street next to Red Square, pushing their summerlong nicotine
protest to the heart of Soviet power.
   The scores of protesters ended their blockade after several
hours Wednesday, but only after a truck delivered a dozen cases of
cigarettes to a nearby tobacco kiosk. A line of more than 230
people formed immediately.
   ``It's only a temporary success,'' said protester Sergei
Borinov, watching the truck driver unload the cigarettes. ``They
bring something, sell it in 10 minutes, and again there is nothing.
This is the way we live.''
   Deputy Mayor Sergei B. Stankevich said 22 of 24 cigarette
factories have closed for repairs in the Russian republic.

   They consider themselves modern-day
disciples of Jesus Christ, but they wear cloth of a different kind.
   T-shirts, jeans, tattoos and Harley-Davidson motorcycles are
their priestly uniforms and spreading the word of God to outlaw
bikers is their mission.
   Guy Girratono, Robert Kaps and the Rev. Dale Crofford have been
bikers since their youth and each has had his share of trouble.
   Girratono served time for armed bank robbery and assault;
Crofford served time for assault with intent to kill; Kaps rode
aimlessly around Oklahoma, moving from one job to another.
   It wasn't until they reached the lowest point in their lives
that they ``found God,'' they say, through people who cared. In
turn, they seek to bring Jesus into the hearts of motorcycle gangs.
   ``I just have a real heart for these people. I lived that life
in my younger years and I got saved,'' said the bearded Crofford,
dressed in a Harley-Davidson t-shirt, jeans and heavy work boots _
an outfit similar to what he wears when he preaches to his
congregation at the Wellington Holy Christian Fellowship Church in
Wellington, Mo.
   ``I believe that you can be a Christian and be you and this is
what I am,'' said Crofford, 48. When not preaching, Crofford works
in a motorcycle shop in the Kansas City area.
   ``I just believe that these guys and girls out there need to
know that God loves them exactly where they're at,'' he said. ``We
can be Christians, ride motorcycles, love God and still dress this
way.''
   For years, Crofford wore a suit and tie on the pulpit but felt
awkward.
   ``What does a preacher look like, anyway? I don't know,'' he
said.``I believe that if (Saint) Peter would have lived in this day
and age he would have been a biker. That's the kind of man he was.''
   The three men spend many weekends attending bikers rallies
across Missouri. They hold outdoor services, each contributing his
unique talent.
   Crofford, knowledgeable about the Bible, preaches the Gospel.
Kaps, a baritone, sings the hymns. Girratono, a diplomat of sorts,
preaches and uses his contacts with gang leaders to give the three
a safe haven in the biker's camps.
   Girratono, 51, said he has spent years cultivating the leaders
of outlaw bike clubs in Kansas City so the three can move freely
within those circles.
   ``I can move in their rallies, in their groups, in their
festivities without a threat of reprisal of any kind,'' Girratono
said. ``They know me; they respect me and I have their blessing, so
to speak.''
   Some biker gangs treat their ministry with indifference, others
with curiosity.
   ``I've had some who have come to me and cried,'' Crofford said.
``I've had some who have come to me and said `I want to change but
I don't know how.' I've had some who've said `I'm not going to go
to a religious blankety-blank church.'
   ``The important thing is that we're there to help if they have a
need.''
   During many bikers rallies, club members often indulge in drugs
and alcohol, Girratono said. ``We want to introduce them to a
better way of life _ a life free from the bondage of alcohol or
drugs and illicit sex.''
   Once a biker shows an interest in their message, the second part
of their mission begins _ preparing bikers to withstand persecution
and getting mainstream churches to accept them, tattoos and all.
   ``Even if a person comes to Christ from this biking community,
for that man to walk into a church next Sunday morning and sit down
and receive the word of God like anybody else off the street is not
going to happen in most cases,'' Girratono said.
   ``We hope to give them a good enough grounding so they are not
hurt. Their emotions are very delicate.''
   The three also hope to convince mainline churches to receive
these kinds of people. Rejection by the church is a familiar and
painful feeling for Kaps.
   Lonely and down on his luck at the age of 19, Kaps walked into a
Tulsa, Okla., church, looking as he does today _ wearing a ragged
T-shirt, jeans and work boots.
   One of the church members told him to clean up and put on a tie.
He was taken by the elbow and escorted out of the church.
   It was some time before he made his way back to a church.
   When not attending biker's rallies, the three often participate
in community activities to benefit the less fortunate.
   In March, they joined more than 450 bikers on a 100-mile charity
ride to benefit the homeless. The bikers donated more than $23,000
to the City Union Mission in Kansas City, a privately funded
homeless shelter.

<DATELINE>NYAGUWE RIVER, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold fever killed Annah Chayera.
   Sand and boulders crushed her when a crude, hand-dug mineshaft
collapsed in a gold belt known since biblical times.
   Stuart Simba was luckier. He only got a police bullet in the
shoulder while fleeing an illegal dig.
   A decade of growing unemployment in this southern African
country has spurred thousands like them to try their luck at the
rivers that criss-cross the region.
   In rugged bush 55 miles northeast of Harare, the capital,
hundreds of panners carry alluvial sand to the water's edge from a
maze of unpropped shafts recklessly burrowed 50 feet or more into
the bank of the Nyaguwe River.
   They swirl sand and water in pans hewn from the trunk of the
mahogany-like munhondo tree. The sand washes away and, when luck
smiles, leaves pinhead flecks of pure gold or, sometimes, a nugget
the size of a dove's egg.
   Panners work along thousands of miles of rivers in the gold belt
that runs diagonally across the country.
   In northeast Zimbabwe is Mount Fura, once thought to be the land
of Ophir, described in tales of Phoenician seafarers retold in the
Old Testament's Book of Kings.
   Milton placed ``Paradise Lost'' there, and Rider Haggard chose
it for the site of King Solomon's legendary mines.
   Modern archaeological investigations generally have discredited
the legends, but the origins of Lebanese cedar trees and wild
lemons found in the landlocked region hundreds of miles from the
coast never have been fully explained.
   What is certain, historian Henrik Ellert said, is that the
legends attracted Portuguese explorers. They were searching for
gold in the 16th and 17th centuries, and found it.
   ``The Portuguese records show it was panned by local villagers
in the river beds in exactly the same way it is done now,'' said
Ellert, a Danish-born Zimbabwean who writes books on regional
history.
   Natives exchanged the gold, called goride in the local Shona
language, for cloth and beads.
   Traders took it by foot and dugout canoe to a natural deep-water
harbor known as Sofala in what is now Mozambique. From there, it
was shipped to India and Goa to be traded for spices.
   Zimbabwe ranks as the world's 11th largest gold producer. Annual
output of about 18 tons from legal mines earns $300 million for the
treasury.
   Gold mined or panned illegally is estimated to be worth an
additional $20 million a year, putting Zimbabwe alongside Brazil
and Papua New Guinea in that category.
   So pure is the alluvial gold that it easily can be melted and
fashioned into bracelets or other items for smuggling. Panned gold
dust can be hidden in such places as the shafts of ballpoint pens.
   Matthew de Klerk, a prospector who owns a legal gold claim, said
the modern traffic works this way:
   Dealers buy illegal gold from miners in local currency, sell it
for hard currency on bullion markets in Europe and India, then sell
the hard currency in Africa for more than twice the original cost
of the gold.
   The Zimbabwe Chamber of Mines estimates at least 50,000 people
are panning gold illegally, most of them because they cannot find
jobs.
   Officially, the unemployment rate is 23 percent in this nation
of 9.5 million, representing an increase of 60 percent since 1985.
Private economists put the figure much higher.
   Little panning was done in the 1970s because the war of
independence made it too dangerous. Laws against illegal mining
were enforced before that, when Zimbabwe was white-ruled Rhodesia.
   Today's free-lance prospectors ignore laws that restrict the
purchase of gold to the state bank and forbid panning for
environmental reasons.
   Panning has clogged rivers and dams with silt and caused
devastating soil erosion, even desertification, along the
once-fertile water courses, the Natural Resources Board reported.
   ``Tragically, we don't have the men or enough four-wheel-drive
vehicles to police our rivers,'' said Keith Harvey, a board
official.
   Authorities confiscate thousands of dollars worth of gold from
the few illegal prospectors arrested each year, but individuals
seldom are fined more than 1,500 Zimbabwean dollars ($600 U.S.),
according to the Chamber of Mines.
   ``It is worth the risk,'' said panner Elias Mutasa. ``There's
goride here. Plenty plus.''

<HEAD>Dispute Keeps Medals of Nude Marilyn Monroe Off Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRIL JONES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dispute over the rights to Marilyn Monroe's image
is keeping a French mint from distributing a gold medallion
depicting her nude figure.
   La Monnaie de Paris, established in the time of the Emperor
Charlemagne, is a branch of the Finance Ministry. It took the
medallion off the market because of claims by Roger Richman, a
California licensing agent.
   La Monnaie de Paris has made medallions for 400 years and first
produced the Marilyn medals in bronze in 1985, said Patrice Cahart,
director of the mint.
   ``It was part of a series of medallions featuring about a dozen
cinema stars struck to commemorate the Cannes Film Festival,'' he
said in an interview. ``It is something done quite frequently with
figures from the arts, theater, etcetera.''
   In 1987, the mint produced the Marilyn medal in gold because of
an order from a Japanese dealer, Cahart said.
   The coins have her face and name on one side and, on the other,
her nude figure in the reclining pose reproduced on countless
posters and calendars in the 28 years since her suicide.
   Richman claimed he controlled the rights to the
commercialization of her image and La Monnaie de Paris halted sales
of the medallions in 1988, Cahart said.
   Early in August, Richman told The Associated Press in Los
Angeles: ``We are now in the process of settlement negotiations.''
He said no lawsuit had been filed, but he would not rule out the
possibility.
   ``The estate of Marilyn Monroe has French trademarks covering
this classification,'' Richman said.
   The gold medallions are of 18-karat gold, less than an inch in
diameter and weigh slightly more than a quarter-ounce.
   Cahart said most of the medallions produced had been sold, but
would not say how many there were or give the market value, citing
the negotiations with Richman.
   Bronze medallions of Marilyn sold for the equivalent of about
$32, Cahart said. Although he would not divulge the price of the
gold medallions, they are said to cost hundreds of dollars each.
   He said the mint took the medallions off the market voluntarily
and ``there are continuing discussions with Mr. Richman.''
   ``He says he owns the rights to Marilyn's image and that we must
pay for its use,'' Cahart said. ``We've asked him for proof of his
claim, and as of now we have not received any such proof. The
situation remains unclear.''
   If Richman substantiates his claim, the mint is prepared to
reach a settlement, the director said.
   Nude figures were common on medallions produced in the 1930s,
but not of celebrities, Cahart said.
   ``There's nothing shocking about Marilyn Monroe nude,'' he said.
``It's a very familiar pose, not something we made up. It's just a
question of `sous' _ someone feels we owe him money and wants us to
pay.''

<HEAD>A Blow to the Wealth Effect</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The wealth effect, that immeasurable, partly
psychological component of the economy, has taken an awful beating
in the past few weeks. People just don't feel as well off as before.
   It isn't difficult to find the reasons why. The stock market is
down, many home values have shrunk, inflation has quickened, the
jobless rate is rising, credit is tight, recession talk abounds,
and war seems just a trigger away.
   All these are factors in how people think of their financial
condition, and because almost all these factors have deteriorated,
it is safe to say that a large percentage of Americans consider
themselves less wealthy today.
   The wealth effect isn't based so much on what assets people have
in precise dollars and cents, but how confident they are about
those assets. This confidence, or lack of it, has immediate
repercussions in the marketplace.
   Most immediately affected are the biggest ticket items, such as
homes and cars, but it doesn't take long for a decline to show up
in investments, travel, entertainment, and any unessential services
and postponable purchases.
   Nobody really can measure the wealth effect with any degree of
preciseness, because it represents a self-impression.
   You cannot, for instance, add up a person's assets at a given
time and say that person's wealth effect has been raised or lowered
by the difference in the totals. No, it's more than that; it's how
people read those figures.
   Those readings are as changeable as attitudes.
   If a person has a 20 percent one-year gain in the market value
of a house, and the market is still rising, then it's quite likely
that person will project his or her wealth as even higher.
   If that person believes the market value of the house has fallen
by 20 percent, it is also likely the person might feel more than 20
percent poorer. In such instances, perceptions are more important
than reality.
   Just a slight decrease in the wealth effect can produce major
changes in the marketplace, even if the person's disposable income
and savings remain as high as ever.
   A person generally doesn't buy an automobile, for instance, by
cashing in the equity in the house. Instead, they use savings or
credit, the latter based on their estimate of ability to repay.
That estimate, however, can change with the person's impression of
the value of the house.
   Aware of this, and of rising fuel costs, automakers almost
immediately scaled back their sales estimates for the next few
months and, barring improvement, the impact most likely will spread
to others parts of the economy.
   The latest combination of negative factors has been unusual. It
includes not just higher energy prices, which people have faced
before, but the threat of war, too. It includes threats not just of
inflation but recession as well.
   Surveys by consumer researchers, housing industry organizations
and business researchers show the latest decline in wealth
perceptions include not just the obvious negatives but a varied
assortment of lesser factors.
   An idea of how business perceives such factors is provided by
Paul M. Low, president of Lomas Mortgage USA.
   Commenting on weakness in homebuilding, he cited, among other
reasons, demographics, taxation, regulation, financing, ``and even
some consumer psychology for good measure.''
   Consumer psychology obviously depends on how much money people
have in their wallets. A fat wallet promotes a feeling of
confidence when a person walks into an automobile showroom.
   But maybe even more important than the dollars in that wallet is
the perception of the wallet owner. Sometimes $100 makes a person
feel rich, and sometimes it seems barely enough to finance survival.

<HEAD>IMAGINE YELLOWSTONE: Celebrating the Wolf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KURT J. REPANSHEK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wolves, shadowy creatures
of the woods who strike fear in some while unleashing the wildness
in others, have been captured by young imaginations in an art
display at Yellowstone National Park.
   Each year, the park solicits art from students in grades 5-12 in
an effort to encourage appreciation of natural areas such as
Yellowstone. The exhibit's theme changes annually. This year it is
``The Wolf,'' while next year's theme will be ``Celebrating Our
Parks.''
   Students interpret the theme any way they wish, in poetry,
paintings, drawings, sculpture or essays. The exhibits were on
display this summer in Yellowstone's visitors' center at Mammoth
Hot Springs.
   ``Through colors, shapes and words they (the students) have
shared the wolf of their imaginations,'' reads the introduction to
the exhibit. ``Traditionally, the wolf has elicited from its human
neighbors a mosaic of curiosity and kinship, hate and fear.
   ``Human encroachment, combined with misunderstanding, has led to
the eradication of wolf populations across much of their habitat,
including Yellowstone National Park. . . . Perhaps the concern and
understanding conveyed in their art works can help foster a new
relationship with this animal and the other wild inhabitants whom
we share the Earth.''
   Alexis Ellwood of Edina, Minn., submitted a poem entitled, ``Ode
to the Wolf'':
   ``Oh wolf, your cry is sad,
   ``They shot you, and drove you north
   ``Away from the beauty of your homeland,
   ``The moose and the bighorn.
   ``. . . Oh wolf, your cry is joyous,
   ``At last we may find you back in the beauty of your homeland
   ``The pronghorn and the deer,
   ``Back in the beauty of Yellowstone. . .''
   It's the old relationship, in which the wolf is seen as a
bloodthirsty predator with a taste for cattle and sheep, that has
largely held up a proposal to restore the animals to Yellowstone.
   Driven from the park at the turn of the century by a massive
federal and state extermination program, there's been an ongoing
debate in recent years over whether the wolf, considered to be the
``missing link'' in Yellowstone's ecosystem, should be allowed back
in the park.
   Opponents say wolves will not stay within Yellowstone but rather
head into the surrounding countryside and prey on livestock.
   Many of the students seem sympathetic to the wolf's plight; some
of their works artistically return the predator to the park.
   Ellwood, in a painting tied to her ode, placed a wolf on a high
plateau with head lifted up to the moon, howling.
   Ross Mellinger, 13, of Millwood, W.Va., pictured a harsher scene
in his work, ``Unleashed Snowfall.'' In it a wolf is posed over a
bloodied rabbit.
   For 11-year-old Joshua Wiersma of Idaho Falls, Idaho, the
Japanese poetry form of Haiku helped him convey his feelings about
wolves:
   ``The wolf, how mighty
   ``His chest so great and strong,
   ``He cries in Yellowstone.''
   Wendy Despain, 15, of Mammoth Hot Springs, conveyed the wolf's
absence from Yellowstone through a collage entitled ``What's
Missing From This Picture?''
   In the collage, Despain created a wolf in white construction
paper standing atop a black ridge. The surrounding forest is
varying shades of green, blue and black paper, while the sky is
black and the moon white.
   In her painting, ``Through His Eyes,'' 14-year-old Molly
Stratton of Bozeman, Mont., captured a hunter reflected in the eye
of a wolf.
   J.J. Adamsen of Franklin, Va., took a look at the ongoing debate
of whether wolves should be restored to Yellowstone. The
18-year-old's piece pictures a wolf standing by a downed tree in
the snow with a rising moon over the mountains. It's entitled,
``Twilight in Yellowstone, Past or Future?''
   Finally, Libbi Alcorn of Saratoga, Wyo., touched on ``wolf the
predator'' in her artwork, ``Fatal Intentions,'' in which a wolf is
silhouetted in a yellow moon.
   While the predator's head is colored blue, Alcorn ran a red
stripe up its nose and over its forehead and painted a red tongue
surrounded by turquoise teeth.

   It's a performer's dream: audiences who idolize
them, full houses, high ticket prices, potentially huge record
sales.
   And for many of the world's hottest musicians, Japan is the best
place to be. Whether it's rock, classical or jazz, Japan has become
a must stop _ often the first stop _ for traveling bands.
   Madonna kicked off her 1990 world tour, ``Blond Ambition,'' with
a seven-concert tour of Japan beginning April 13, then went back to
the United States and on to Europe.
   ``The money (in Japan) is certainly a factor,'' said Liz
Rosenberg, a publicist for Warner Bros. Records. ``Tour sponsorship
in Japan is on a much bigger scale than in other parts of the
world. Financially, it's very worthwhile.''
   Although Rosenberg refused to say how worthwhile, fans paid
about $4.5 million to attend Madonna's first three concerts in
Tokyo alone. There was no indication how much of that went to
Madonna and how much to local organizers.
   The singer's flashy show in Tokyo consisted of little more than
deafening music and a garishly lighted stage. Still, about 35,000
young fans at an outdoor stadium screamed and cheered under driving
rains through shows that lasted for two-hours.
   Other pop performers who played for Japanese audiences in the
first half of 1990 include Paul MaCartney, the Rolling Stones,
Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, Tracy Chapman, Bobby McFerrin and
David Bowie.
   Rock stars perform in huge stadiums, packing in tens of
thousands, while classical music concerts are much smaller. But
while Madonna's top ticket price was about $56, good seats for the
Chicago Symphony in Tokyo ran as high as $168 each.
   For classical music lovers, the Chicago Symphony, St. Louis
Symphony, Cleveland Orchestra and the London Symphony, with Leonard
Bernstein conducting, have all made recent tours of Japan.
   Many of the orchestral world's top batons are enthusiastic about
the Japanese music consumer.
   St. Louis Symphony Conductor Leonard Slatkin finds Japanese
audiences ``quiet, polite and appreciative.''
   ``European audiences often take the music for granted. Japanese
never do,'' said Christoph von Dohnanyi, the conductor of the
Cleveland Orchestra, which toured Japan for two weeks in May.
   Israeli conductor and pianist Daniel Barenboim, who has been
coming to Japan to perform for 25 years, agrees.
   ``I'm always struck by the silence with which the Japanese
audiences listen to music. It makes me feel the music is not just
entertainment, but that there is a deep respect _ almost awe _ for
the music,'' said Barenboim, musical director-designate of the
Chicago Symphony Orchestra, in an interview.
   ``That is something I find inspiring. No other audiences are
like this.'' No other audiences buy records like the Japanese do
either. Henry Fogel, executive director of the Chicago Symphony,
says that among the three largest record markets in the world _
Europe, the United States and Japan _ the orchestra's royalties
payments are highest from Japan.
   Fees paid to the orchestra by musical presenter Kajimoto Concert
Management Co. are about twice what the Chicago Symphony gets when
it tours European capitals, but costs are higher in Japan too, says
Fogel. Sponsorship from Motorola, Inc., and Kajimoto's fee just
covered the $2.1 million cost of the orchestra's three-week Japan
tour last April. ``We'll break even,'' Fogel says.
   Japan is also home to some well-known festivals that attract the
giants of jazz. This summer's Mount Fuji Jazz Festival featured
Wynton Marsalis and Dizzy Gillespie. Another festival outside
Tokyo, ``Select Live Under the Sky,'' will feature Pat Metheny,
Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter and Jack Dejohnette.
   Japanese jazz fans will pay $270 a ticket to see Miles Davis at
a small Tokyo club this month.
   Jazz has been popular in Japan since it was first introduced by
U.S. occupation forces after World War II. American jazz labels
such as Blue Note have said they were able to remain in business
during slumps in jazz's popularity in the United States because of
continuing support in Japan.
   Japan is the second largest market after the United States, and
jazz music sales here total about $66 million a year.

<TEXT>
   The remarkable resurgence of quality TV
animation for children reaches a culmination of sorts this fall
with the premiere of ``The Disney Afternoon,'' a daily two-hour
block of shows.
   Disney rolls out the block of funny-animal cartoons Sept. 10 in
146 television markets covering 93 percent of the country. And
Disney is not alone in its efforts to attract young viewers.
   On Sept. 8, Fox Broadcasting Co.'s Fox Children's Network rolls
out six new Saturday morning shows _ three hours of cartoons. Its
animated ``Fox's Peter Pan &amp; the Pirates,'' a daily half-hour,
premieres Sept. 17.
   Warner Bros.' syndicated ``Tiny Toon Adventures,'' produced by
Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment, debuts with an
unprecedented CBS special Sept. 14 showcasing the all-new cast of
teen-age cartoon characters.
   Buster Bunny, Babs Bunny, Plucky Duck and Hamton J. Pig begin
their 65-episode syndication run the following Monday, Sept. 17. In
some markets, they will be teamed with a half-hour of repackaged
``Merrie Melodies.''
   Credit for this cartoon renaissance goes to Disney, which
simultaneously revived a dying industry and upped the stakes for TV
cartoons in 1987 with ``DuckTales,'' the adventures of Uncle
Scrooge and newphews Huey, Dewey and Louie.
   Until ``DuckTales,'' programmers wondered whether children's
cartoons could survive on TV at all. The medium was artistically
bankrupt, a violent, sexist marketplace for 22-minute commercials
wrapped around ads for candy, toys and breakfast cereals.
   The producers were willing to take heat from critics as long as
they were moving the goods, but once every girl owned My Little
Pony and every boy a set of Transformers, the fads faded. Kids
stopped watching and panic set in.
   ``DuckTales,'' syndicated by Disney's Buena Vista Television,
immediately became the highest-rated children's TV show. It was
luxuriously animated, with rich backgrounds, depth and detail. And
it was story-driven, not toy-driven.
   The difference in quality was obvious, even in terms of cels _
the single sheets of celluloid in which animators draw the
foreground action.
   ``These were literally made for television,'' said Gary Krisel,
head of Disney Television Animation, in an interview earlier this
year.
   ``Our shows are averaging 22,000 drawings, full cels,'' he said.
``That compares with an average 10 years ago of 8,000 to 10,000 or
12,000. The best other shows today are around 15,000 cels.''
   That's still not as many cels as a feature film. Projected onto
a big screen, ``DuckTales'' action would look jerky and uneven. On
the little screen _ and compared with a 10,000-cel cartoon _ it
looks like ``Fantasia.''
   ``We're running between $400,000 and $650,000 an episode,''
Krisel said.
   ``DuckTales'' stayed No. 1 until 1989, when it was supplanted by
Disney's own ``Chip 'n' Dale's Rescue Rangers,'' starring the
aforesaid chipmunks, which is the second component of ``The Disney
Afternoon.''
   The third show is ``Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears''
which moves from Saturday morning, where it has been the No. 1 show
in its time period for five years.
   The final half-hour, and perhaps the most accessible to older
children (and certain TV writers) is ``Tale Spin,'' a delightful,
new, funny-animal adventure that brings back Baloo the Bear, Louie
the Ape and Shere Khan the Tiger from Disney's theatrical hit ``The
Jungle Book.''
   Big, burly Baloo operates the Higher for Hire air cargo service
owned by cute bear Rebecca. She, her daughter Molly, Baloo and the
orphaned cub Kit Cloudkicker face a wonderful band of funny,
villainous air pirates.
   ``Tale Spin'' is Disney's highest achievment yet in TV
animation, and uses computer animation to help artists move objects
_ like planes _ through space and for the changing perspectives of
intricate dogfights and stunt flying.
   It is first-rate animation, well-written, equally appealing to
boys and girls, and fun to watch.
   As good as it is _ and that's VERY good _ Disney's two-hour
block of funny animal cartoons isn't balanced fare for younger
viewers who deserve TV that aspires to address all their interests
and needs just like grownups' TV.
   ``Diversity is not the name of their game,'' said Peggy Charren
of Action for Children's Television, a relentless lobbyist for
expanding the scope of kids' TV.
   ``One thing you can say about animal shows is at least the
characters aren't all white. Unfortunately, there's also not a lot
of role models,'' she said.
   ``Somebody has to tell the broadcasters that a steady diet of
Day-Glo animals and squeaking ducks, no matter how charming, isn't
enough.''

<TEXT>
   The sudden and unanticipated escalation of
Mideast tensions in the past two weeks has battered not only the
securities markets but the pretensions of the market's short-term
forecasters.
   Such forecasters abound in the marketplace, and most of them get
very good money for selling their notions to the public. Their
numbers include not just advisers at the extreme of plausibility,
but many brokers, too.
   Whatever their method, the claim is the same, that week to week,
and even day to day, the stock market's movements can be revealed
in advance by means of charts, graphs, cycles, patterns, formulas
and special insight.
   While some practitioners have a degree of rationality to guide
them, and some might even have streaks of good luck, almost all of
them must concede that the biggest factors of all might lie beyond
their province.
   It is that many of the triggers producing rises and falls in
markets have very little to do with their area of expertise. They
might know something about stocks, even about popular behavior, but
nothing about Saddam Hussein.
   Nor do many have insight into the likelihood that earthquakes,
storms or droughts might occur. Or into the private thoughts of
Federal Reserve chairmen, into what Congress is liable to do, or
who will declare war.
   Even over longer periods of time, the record of forecasters is
not very good. Hulbert Financial Digest, for example, monitored 21
newsletters over a 10-year period, and found only two that beat a
Standard &amp; Poor's average.
   Within those longer periods, some forecasters have streaks of
outstanding performance, but good performance is often followed by
poor. Even Peter Lynch, one of the greatest portfolio managers
ever, has conceded the point.
   While longer time periods allow for mistakes to be corrected,
shorter time periods do not. Performance records disappear when the
attempt is made day to day, and there exist thousands of former
believers who found out the hard way.
   This doesn't mean that short-term forecasting efforts will ever
cease, in part because a new crop of investors is constantly
entering the market. And it doesn't mean that existing forecasters
will admit to failure.
   The future is a free-for-all. Anything can be said about it
because nobody knows anything about it. And if the forecast is
properly worded, the forecaster can blame events for not unfolding
as ``logically'' as they should have.
   Nobody can say for certain how events will unfold in the
Mideast, but whatever does will influence the stock market. Nothing
beyond that is certain.
   And, important a factor as it is, the Mideast crisis is by no
means the only influence on the latest decline in prices. Even
before the invasion of Kuwait there existed statistical evidence
that the market was overpriced.
   That much a forecaster could have ascertained, but to have
foretold exactly when a correction was to occur would have taken a
feat of intellectual insight beyond human capacity and the
understanding of science.
   Unless, of course, the forecaster was Saddam Hussein.

<DATELINE>SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Labor unrest is growing in Brazil, and
acquiring a tone of violence and sabotage that could threaten the
government's ambitious anti-inflation program.
   If his members continue to lose buying power, said union leader
Vicente Paulo da Silva, the result might be a ``major social
convulsion with unpredictable consequences.''
   In late July, hundreds of auto workers went on a three-day
rampage at the Sao Paulo subsidiary of Ford Motor Co., where a
strike shut down production for more than a month. They destroyed
more than 50 cars, smashed windows and doors and set fires in the
plant administration buildings.
   A strike by power workers this month caused a 10-hour blackout
in Brasilia, the capital, and shut off electricity for two hours in
the northeastern state of Bahia. In Brasilia, the lights went out
in government ministries and the residence of President Fernando
Collor de Mello.
   Ozires Silva, infrastructure minister of the national
government, told reporters ``signs of sabotage'' were found at
power stations and authorities might sue the power workers' union
for damages.
   Labor leaders say the violence is a sign of rebellion against
the pay restrictions Collor's government contends are vital to its
anti-inflation plan.
   ``The incidents at Ford were merely a sign of the future
violence that could erupt as a result of the workers' despair,'' da
Silva, president of the Sao Bernardo do Campo Metalworkers Union,
said in an interview. ``Their wages are not enough to feed, clothe,
educate or house their children decently.''
   Most foreign-owned auto plants are in Sao Bernardo do Campo, an
industrial suburb of Sao Paulo, Brazil's financial center and
largest city. Da Silva's union, which says it represents 140,000
workers, is considered Brazil's most militant and politicized.
   Da Silva said the government was ``trying to control inflation
by provoking recession and unemployment, and slashing our
purchasing power.''
   More than 500 strikes have occurred since Collor announced a
radical austerity program March 16, one day after taking office,
aimed at reducing annual inflation of nearly 5,000 percent.
   His plan included an 18-month freeze on savings and money market
accounts, elimination of subsidies and incentives, the sale of
government mansions and cars, and mass layoffs of public employees.
   Inflation came down from nearly 100 percent a month to about 11
percent in July, but the economy headed toward recession, and
unemployment soared.
   The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics said nearly
1 million employees of private companies had lost their jobs since
March 16 and more than 100,000 federal employees had been dismissed.
   Industrial output dropped 7.1 percent during the first six
months of 1990, said the institute, whose statistics the government
considers official.
   In May, Collor's government ended automatic cost-of-living wage
adjustments and said workers must negotiate pay raises with
employers. Indexed pay increases had been a traditional Brazilian
hedge against inflation.
   Hundreds of thousands of workers have gone on strike in an
effort to recover at least part of the purchasing power lost to
inflation.
   Labor leaders want raises of more than 100 percent for their
members to compensate for the wild inflation before Mar. 16.
   ``These losses must be replaced in the worker's paycheck,'' da
Silva said. ``Then we could negotiate real wage hikes based on
productivity.
   ``The government must adopt a wage policy that guarantees wages
will be adjusted to inflation.''
   Collor said in a radio interview he would veto any congressional
attempt to reinstate automatic wage adjustments because they would
``plunge Brazil back into a hyperinflationary spiral.''
   Workers interviewed by The Associated Press said raises obtained
through negotiations had not closed the gap.
   Josemar de Medeiros, a 30-year-old maintenance worker at Ford,
got a 59 percent raise after the strike and earns the equivalent of
$915 a month. That is excellent pay in Brazil, where the monthly
minimum wage is about $62.
   ``This salary makes me a member of the elite of Brazil's work
force, yet I can't buy new clothes for my children, can't pay a
day-care center, can barely pay the rent for a cramped two-bedroom
apartment and can't even dream of buying what I help produce,''
Medeiros said.
   Millions of lower-paid workers are in serious trouble, he said,
and told a reporter: ``Our purchasing power is declining day by day
and we are angry. If this situation continues, the wave of strikes
will certainly grow.''
   Some economists are puzzled by the widespread labor trouble.
During a recession, they say, workers usually are more concerned
with keeping their jobs than getting more pay.
   Da Silva's response: ``Workers are fed up with footing the bill
for economic stabilization programs. The mass dismissals and the
loss in purchasing power prove the Collor government lied when it
said its austerity program would not sacrifice the working class.
   ``Today, the worker feels he has nothing to lose except his fear
of getting fired, and he's losing that rapidly.''

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Born of an odd mixture of 1970s funk, punk
rock, rap, California surf, skateboard and hippie cultures, a wild
musical genre called ``thrash funk'' has swept the San Francisco
club scene.
   The area that gave rise to acid rock in the 1960s is now the
nation's hotbed of the colorful, youth-driven ``punk-funk,'' and
the record industry is ready to cash in.
   ``If any of these bands break through, you are going to have the
entire industry swooping down on San Francisco to scoop up what
they can find,'' said John Axelrod, director of artist and
repertoire for RCA Records in Los Angeles.
   Inspired largely by George Clinton's Parliament-Funkadelic era,
bands such as Psychefunkapus, Limbomaniacs, Primus, The Smoking
Section and Fungo Mungo make up a diverse musical scene linked by
seething energy, a thumping bass, sometimes bawdy lyrics and a
sense of humor.
   ``It's about intensity, which is always a good rock 'n' roll
standard,'' said Butthouse, lead singer and bassist for
Limbomaniacs.
   Band members dismiss the label ``thrash-funk'' as confining,
confusing and misleading, and cite an array of influences led by
Clinton and augmented by James Brown, Prince, Jimi Hendrix, Frank
Zappa and Led Zeppelin.
   ``To me, each of these bands is completely different than the
others,'' said Psychefunkapus bassist Atom Ellis. ``Primus is
really hard-edged. Fungo Mungo is more like James Brown meets the
Red Hot Chile Peppers. Limbomaniacs are more of a go-go kind of
thing. Smoking Section is a really smooth groove band. It's hard to
say what we are.''
   Despite the diversity, the so-called ``punk funksters'' seem to
admire one another's music. And there's a street style of long
hair, tattoos and muscular physiques shared by some of the band
members and many of their fans.
   Axelrod signed Psychefunkapus in late 1989 when he worked at
Atlantic Records, and plans to soon sign The Smoking Section to
RCA. He says the bands present a wholly American sound that
embodies San Francisco's liberal past.
   ``These are pseudo-hippies,'' he said. ``It's another evolution
of what the psychedelic movement was about in the first place _
free love and peace, addressing the issues but remembering we are
here to have a good time.''
   The scene appears to have evolved almost by mistake, coming on
the heels of the late 1980s success of Los Angeles groups The Red
Hot Chile Peppers and Fishbone. Both are widely seen as progenitors
of the funk-influenced thrash genre, although San Francisco
musicians distance themselves from such bands.
   ``It seems like every one of these aggregate groups started on
their own, with little influence from the others,'' said David
Hawkins, drummer of The Smoking Section. ``We came in a little
later, but we'd never seen them or heard them until we got billed
with them.''
   Primus and the Limbomaniacs came first, standing today as the
bands with the strongest instrumental skills and the most funny and
raunchy lyrics. Both have recorded albums on independent labels.
   Six-year-old Primus, led by comical bassist-singer Les Claypool,
is the thrashiest of the thrash-funk bands.
   After some personnel changes, the band released a self-pressed
live album called ``Suck on This.'' Four years of talks with Geffen
Records failed to produce results, and the band produced its first
studio album, ``Frizzle Fry,'' on the New York-based Caroline label.
   Psychefunkapus was the first San Francisco punk funk band to
sign with a big label. Their Atlantic debut is in the Top 10 on the
college charts, with more than 28,000 albums sold, including about
8,000 in Dallas. The Marin County-based band represents the
psychedelic wing of the genre, a funk sound mixed with rap, reggae
and acid rock.
   The Limbomaniacs go heavy on Washington-rooted go-go street
music, rap and funk. The band's debut album is due out soon on
Relativity Records, with Bootsy Collins, of Clinton's
Parliament-Funkadelic, singing on the opening track, ``Butt
Funkin'.''
   The thrash-funk audience is a heavily white, male crowd. The
beat lures listeners to the dance floor. Braver souls head to the
core of the throbbing, slam-dancing mob, where people are pushed
and shoved, almost against the grain of the music, and some dive or
are thrown at the stage.
   ``This is music that has found its root in live performance,''
said Creighton Burke, manager of Psychefunkapus. ``A lot of the old
1970s rock created record sales out of the live performance. The
New York Dolls, the (Grateful) Dead, Hendrix _ those bands created
album sales through live performance.''
   Fungo Mungo started three years ago as a ``punk-fusion'' band,
later integrating a funk-style bass.
   ``We all loved heavy rock bands from the 1970s: Black Sabbath,
AC-DC. I love disco,'' said bassist Arion Salazar, 19, of Fungo
Mungo. ``Now, I love KC and Sunshine Band. I used to hate them. It
was so cheesy. You're eight years old and you see a bunch of guys
with big bell bottoms jumping around. ... In hindsight, that was
what was cool. It's kind of neat now.''

   True to the name of the band, the lanky
lead singer of the funk-inspired Smoking Section wanders on stage
with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth, a gray cloud of smoke
wafting out over the audience.
   ``The smoking section is the place in the back of the room,''
singer Tony Hawkins said before a recent packed show at Slim's
nightclub. ``It's darkly lit, and you have characters acting up.
It's kind of a bad-boy symbol.''
   Hawkins takes another stab at finding meaning behind the name:
``Really, the rhythm section is smoking.''
   Made up of young but solid musicians, The Smoking Section has
surfaced in just 18 months as a top local club draw. Now, national
attention promised by a major recording contract looms ahead.
   The five-member band, boasting superb guitar and bass work, rode
in on the ``thrash-funk'' wave of the late 1980s, though the tag
doesn't quite fit. With a more groove-based sound and a two-man
horn section, the style is more funk than thrash _ a factor that
might help The Smoking Section attract a wider audience than some
of the more jarring bands of the genre.
   Absent is the harshness, long hair and skateboarder look that
mark other ``punk funksters.''
   ``Hopefully, we have as wide or wider appeal (than the others)
because we'll appeal to older crowds by giving the music more
melody, not just in-your-face thrash,'' said drummer David Hawkins,
no relation to the singer.
   David Hawkins and guitarist Damon Wood, both of Berkeley, first
ran into each other in a local cafe several years ago. They found
they shared a love of funk, mostly George Clinton, Prince and James
Brown.
   The core of the band began playing in 1988 and hired the lead
singer eight months later after exhaustive auditioning.
   The founders toyed with the idea of calling themselves Three
White Boys with Glasses, but eventually opted for the smoother
name. The rest of the band now consists of bassist B.O.B., sax
player Adam Beach and trumpeter Scott Jenson.
   The band's short history is a name-dropper's dream.
   Big breaks came from two 1970s pop stars, Clinton himself and
Boz Scaggs.
   Beckoned by concert promoter Bill Graham, The Smoking Section
opened for two of Clinton's shows at the Warfield Auditorium last
year. Then the band caught Scaggs' ear while opening for an act at
Slim's, a club owned by Scaggs, who eventually produced the group's
demo tape for RCA Records.
   ``He's only done this for two other bands _ The Cars and Huey
Lewis,'' David Hawkins said. ``He made a lot of phone calls for us.
We just went `Whoa.' Just his name. He has a very good reputation
and a good ear.''
   Now the band is hammering out an album deal with RCA and hopes
to start recording this fall.
   Tony Hawkins lends visual drama to the band's shows, often
starting sets wearing floppy, ``Cat in the Hat''-type hats and
puffing a Camel. He jumps, dances and jives, leading the audience
into a frenzy.
   Numbers range from the serious ``Water's Edge,'' which examines
the meaning of life, to ``Big Fish,'' which asks listeners to
``Watch out for Big Fish. They're not as harmless as you think.''
   The 24-year-old singer brings his peculiar stage persona to an
interview, repeating the phrases ``goodness gracious,'' and ``that
is dead in your mind,'' when he doesn't want something in print. He
describes his first live performance as ``velvety, crunchy and
eye-opening.''
   Hawkins spent much of his childhood in Oakland, where he sang
with the choir of the Love Center Church, a ministry run by his
stepfather's family. His uncle is Edwin Hawkins of the Edwin
Hawkins Singers, a gospel group whose single ``Oh Happy Day'' was a
hit in 1969.
   As a youth, Tony Hawkins favored Sly and the Family Stone, Chaka
Khan and Marvin Gaye over the white rock his peers tried to push on
him. He said he thinks of himself as an actor as well as a singer.
   ``I was really shy when I was young, and when I broke out, I
broke out hard,'' he said. ``I'm just a fool. And I press things
far, and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.''
   One time it didn't was at the end of a recent set at the
Haight-Ashbury neighborhood club Nightbreak, when the performer
aimed a fire extinguisher at the audience. The cheap Freudian
climax to an otherwise rousing show angered the audience, the
management, and _ when the $150 bill arrived from the club _ the
rest of the band.
   ``There was no encore. It got quiet,'' Hawkins recalled. ``You
heard nothing but rustling and mumbling. It was a killer ending to
a killer show.''

   It takes years and years of familiarity, plus
the addition of a box-office smash actor, to bring a comic book
character to the screen. Just ask ``Joker'' Jack Nicholson, or his
fedora-wearing friend Warren Beatty.
   Don't ask Charles Stein. He's betting $1 million it only takes
slick packaging, massive promotion and a character with a body that
won't quit.
   Stein is readying the Night Cat, a pre-fab crimebuster with a
comic book, a movie and an album all in the works. He sees her as
Janet Jackson meets Wonder Woman _ for $7.50 a ticket, $13.99 per
compact disc.
   ``She's to be aloof and a lady in every respect, untouchable and
desirable,'' Stein says of his instant idol. ``On stage, she is
supposed to be a sex object such as Paula Abdul or Madonna.
   ``She can have a boyfriend if it is not flaunted. She is
supposed to be the ideal of all the young people in every
moralistic way and yet on stage totally the opposite.''
   For this role, Stein recruited an actress-model whose previous
screen credit was a shoe commercial.
   Got that?
   Sure, it's not the way guys like Dick Tracy or Batman made it
big. But Stein says it's the way to go these days, and Marvel
Comics CEO Stan Lee agrees with him.
   ``I'm pretty excited about it,'' said Lee. ``I'm hoping that
it'll be big. We have a personality who seems to be incredibly
talented and one we hope will lead to a series.''
   Of course, it could all turn to kitty litter for 20-year-old
model Jacqueline Sahhara Tavarez, the 20-year-old who was tabbed to
portray the Night Cat. Imaginatively, the hero's alter-ego is named
Jacqueline Tavar.
   When the Night Cat comic book story begins, she's a 19-year-old
criminology student whose father, Carlos, is a police officer.
   Her mother had been a singer, enticed fatally to drugs and
alcohol, who loved her cat, Midnight. Jacqueline signs to a record
company as the Night Cat, dresses accordingly, and doesn't reveal
her identity.
   Time for a plot twist.
   Carlos is assigned to a recording studio where a drug deal is to
go down. Jacqueline, Midnight and a sadistic scientist who makes
designer drugs all happen to be there at the same time.
   Something goes wrong. Time for another plot twist.
   Jacqueline suddenly grows claws, leaps 6 feet into the air with
the ferocity of a jungle cat and escapes the bullet that fells her
father. At his funeral, she vows to avenge his death. She'll
continue her recording career and use her new powers to fight evil.
   End of story, start of multimedia blitz.
   Lee, who is also chairman of the advisory board of Black Cat
Entertainment, started in comics about 1940. Though he has been
away from ``the nuts and bolts'' of Marvel for 10 years, he was
intrigued enough by the Night Cat to write the first script.
   Marvel is conservative, though. Only one comic book is planned
and Lee isn't sure what its print order will be. ``If we sell 60 or
70 percent of what we print, it's good.
   ``Sometimes, one comic book can give you tremendous
indication,'' Lee says. ``We did Spiderman a few years ago and we
could tell by the sales and reception we had a winner there. The
minute you realize that, you go to press with a lot more issues. We
like to think we have a sense of what will work and what won't.
We're hoping this will happen.''
   Marvel Comics will own the Night Cat's name _ Jacqueline Tavar.
   ``People have said to me many times I look like a cat,'' said
Tavarez. ``I've got my mom's green eyes, thick lips and thick
eyebrows.''
   Her father is from Spain. Her maternal grandfather is Spanish
and her grandmother, named Sahhara, is a Sephardic Jew born in
Egypt. For a time Sahhara was considered as the Night Cat's name.
   ``I like to sing,'' Tavarez said. ``I used to go to the chapel
of the synagogue and sing when I was little. I take singing lessons
and acting lessons. Dancing comes more natural to me.''
   As the Night Cat, she'll do concerts. ``Dancers will be dressed
in villain outfits. I'm singing the song. Maybe I'll stop and be
fighting them. It is going to be really fun.''
   The Night Cat was the idea of Don Kessler, who has a Long Island
public relations firm and has worked for Stein in the past.
   After the deal with Marvel Comics was made, shares were offered
in Black Cat Entertainment Corp. Tavarez owns 10 percent of Black
Cat, Kessler says.
   ``She gets a salary and 25 percent of what she brings in. They
expect to do in excess of $100 million in merchandising, things
like T-shirts with her picture in costume, the first year,''
Kessler said.
   But hype alone can't make the Night Cat purr with success, no
matter how much his company spends, Stein says. She has to come up
to scratch.
   ``It is up to her own performance to determine the level that
she goes,'' he said. ``We're gambling on her. The record company is
also spending a great deal of money.''
   The record company is LMR. Sam LeFrak, millionaire builder, and
Herb Moelis, long-time recording mogul, created LMR, which stands
for LeFrak Moelis Records.
   ``Realistically, in a project like this, we'll spend between
half a million and a million dollars,'' Moelis said. ``Twenty-five
percent will go into recording. The rest is manufacturing,
marketing, advertising, the video that has to be done. You're
dealing with a major project.''
   Moelis says songs are being written for Tavarez. ``They'll be
dance-pop songs, the Paula Abdul, Janet Jackson kind of songs, that
go with the image of the Night Cat _ sensuality, drive and
excitement.''

<HEAD>Taiwan's China Policy Under Review</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNIE HUANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government says the love affair with
China needs better chaperoning to prevent the Communists from
taking advantage, and plans to restrict investments on the mainland
that could harm Taiwan's economy.
   ``The Chinese Communists are conducting trade as part of a
political struggle against us,'' said Ma Ying-jeou of the governing
Nationalist Party, who heads the Mainland Affairs Committee.
   ``If we unilaterally proceed with free trade as a way to achieve
China's reunification, it could lead to very serious consequences.
We need to establish a new order that will look after our security
and our interests.''
   Taiwan businessmen now trade with China and invest there through
third countries, free of Taiwanese government restrictions.
   When the Nationalists relaxed a ban on contacts with the
Communists three years ago, there were hopes that trade, tourism
and other exchanges would help remove obstacles to eventual
reunification.
   More than 1 million Taiwanese, or 5 percent of the island's
population, have visited China since then, and businessmen have
flocked to the mainland to negotiate lucrative contracts.
   Projects financed from Taiwan are estimated to be worth $1
billion and two-way trade totaled $3.5 billion last year, up from
$2.7 billion in 1988. Despite a slowdown in China's economy, trade
is expected to remain at about $3.5 billion this year.
   Differences between the rival governments appear to have
narrowed significantly, but the improvement has been mainly at
Taiwan's expense and important political issues remain, analysts
and scholars say.
   China appears interested only in trade and investment to improve
its economy, they say, and this could be costly to Taiwan if it
becomes too dependent on mainland business.
   ``China is too big,'' an economist who advises the government
said, on condition of anonymity. ``They can easily put political
pressure on us as contacts . . . build up.''
   Vice Premier Shih Chi-yang said Taiwan had no plans to curtail
exchanges, but would bar Taiwanese investment in sensitive
high-technology and defense-related projects. ``We must deal with
the mainland with more reason, more coolness and more dignity,'' he
said.
   Also, he said, the government is trying to improve investment
conditions in Taiwan to discourage businesses from moving to China,
where labor costs are lower.
   The effort has included a crackdown on violent crime _
businessmen have been targets of extortionists and kidnappers _ and
attempts to curb soaring land prices.
   Officials are offering building sites at a bargain prices to
Taiwan's largest conglomerate, the Formosa Plastics Group, if it
will abandon plans to spend $7 billion on factories in China.
   Experts say stricter government control on mainland investment
could give the Nationalists leverage against Beijing's campaign to
push Taiwan off the international stage.
   ``With our economic strength, we are entitled to international
status,'' said presidential spokesman Chiu Cheyne. ``We should not
allow any power to drive us to a corner as they wish.''
   Taiwan is recognized by 27 nations, most of them in the Third
World, and China by 137.
   Under a plan promoted by President Lee Teng-hui, the
Nationalists have asked other countries since last year to
recognize China as a single nation with two governments, one in
Taipei and the other in Beijing.
   The Nationalists still claim to be the sole legitimate
government of China and have shown no inclination toward
reunification on Beijing's terms.
   Grenada, Liberia, Belize, Lesotho and Guinea-Bissau recognized
Taiwan under the two-government formula. In response, China
suspended relations with those countries.
   In July, the Nationalists were stunned when Saudi Arabia
recognized Beijing, ending 44 years of relations with Taiwan. There
is concern that Singapore, South Korea and South Africa may do the
same.
   Foreign Minister Fredrick Chien blamed the Saudi switch on
Taiwanese businessmen and politicians who visited China without
government approval. He said that had given the wrong signal about
Taiwan's approach to reunification.

<HEAD>Sara Gilbert Plays Southern Teen in Racism Drama `Sudie and
Simpson'</HEAD>

   Sara Gilbert of ``Roseanne'' gets serious for
the Lifetime movie ``Sudie and Simpson,'' in which she plays a
white teen-ager who befriends a black man in a racist Southern town
of the 1940s.
   ``It's about friendship, but it's also a coming of age thing for
Sudie,'' said Miss Gilbert. ``She's growing up and learning about
life. When people in the town find out about their friendship, it
creates a problem. It's a town where black people have never been
allowed in.''
   Louis Gossett Jr. stars as Simpson, a black man who lives as a
recluse in the woods near the town. When he becomes a suspect in an
attack on a young girl, Sudie is the only one willing to speak out
against a white teacher who has been molesting school girls.
   Sudie's friendship with Simpson not only changes both their
lives, it also begins to alter the town's racist views.
   Premiering Tuesday on the Lifetime cable channel, the movie is
based on the novel ``Sudie'' by Sara Flanigan, who wrote the
screenplay with Ken Koser. Joan Tewkesbury directed the film, which
was shot on location in Conyers, Covington and Oxford, Ga., south
of Atlanta.
   Also appearing in the movie are Frances Fisher as a ``Yankee''
schoolteacher who befriends Sudie and Simpson, Paige Danahy as
Sudie's best friend, John Jackson as a physician, Wallace Wilkinson
as a hell-and-brimstone preacher, Larry Black as the school
principal, and Howard Kingkade as the teacher who is molesting the
girls.
   Miss Gilbert talked about ``Sudie and Simpson'' in a stuffy
dressing room across from the ``Roseanne'' stage, where she was
back in her role as Darlene in the ABC comedy series.
   Although the actress is a mature 15, she plays both Darlene and
Sudie as younger teens.
   It is partially because of her age that Sudie and Simpson don't
hit it off immediately in the Lifetime movie. She had never been
close to a black man before and is terrified at first, then
curious. Simpson fears she will tell everyone that he is living
secretly in the woods.
   ``She thought he was going to eat her alive,'' Miss Gilbert
said. ``She'd heard so many stories, and black people were kept out
of the town.''
   Eventually, they form a bond and Simpson becomes a surrogate
father for Sudie, whose own father had rejected her love.
   ``This is the first movie where I've had a good role,'' said
Miss Gilbert. ``I do more here than in anything I've done.''
   Miss Gilbert grew up in a show business family. Her sister,
Melissa Gilbert, starred in ``Little House on the Prairie,'' and
has appeared in a number of other projects. Her brother, Jonathan,
also appeared in ``Little House.''
   Grandfather Harry Crane created and wrote ``The Honeymooners''
and still works on several television shows. And her mother,
Barbara Gilbert, is a talent manager and producer.
   ``I saw my sister doing it and that was a big influence on me,''
said Miss Gilbert. ``I wasn't even born when Melissa started
`Little House.' The first thing I ever did was a pilot of `The
Apple Dumpling Gang.' I was 6. I did a commercial and weekend
special called `Runaway Ralph.' Ralph was a mouse.
   ``I was Jane Alexander's daughter in `Calamity Jane,' '' she
said. ``Then I didn't want to work, and stopped for several years.''
   Next came her role on ``Roseanne.''
   ``Darlene is a tomboy, but she's starting to grow out of it,''
Miss Gilbert said of her character.
   ``I think Darlene connects with her mother in a way she may not
want to admit. She has that same sarcastic kind of humor. Yet she
spends most of her time with her father. She's into sports and the
things he's interested in. My sister spends more time with
Roseanne. My sister and I are always fighting and arguing and
stuff.''
   She said she hopes that like her real-life sister, she can make
the often-difficult transition into adult acting.
   ``I want to direct, too,'' she said. ``I spent a lot of time in
the booth last year watching the director. On `Sudie and Simpson,'
I'd run up to the camera and look through the viewfinder before
each shot. ... I think I'd like to switch back and forth between
acting and directing.''

sharply higher across the country this month, reminding many
drivers of the price shocks and gas lines of the 1970s.
   The long-term effects on energy prices and availability are as
uncertain as the next move in the Mideast drama. One factor: Can
Americans still conserve fuel and electricity the way they learned
to in leaner times? Will they?
   The Associated Press checked with seven energy and
transportation specialists for that perspective on the Gulf crisis.
Here are their responses:

   In my view, this is going to be a long, drawn-out affair. Oil
prices have reached a new permanent plateau _ somewhere in the
mid-20s (dollars per barrel), and that's going to have a damaging
effect on the U.S. economy.
   We're likely to see inflation and recession at the same time.
Prices are going to go up, profits are going to get squeezed, and
the recession that was coming on anyway is going to be accelerated.
   There are a number of things that the government can do to
respond. Obviously, the first and most important is to encourage
greater energy conservation. During the years of low oil prices and
abundant supplies we have forgotten about conservation, and it's
time to refocus our efforts on becoming more energy efficient.
   Compared to the Japanese and the Germans, we squander energy.
Now the time has come for real presidential leadership in this area.

   How many people do you know who have gone to a gas station and
bought less because prices have gone up 15 cents? I don't know
anyone who has, and I don't think at this stage motorists are
thinking along those lines.
   Prices have to remain not only at these levels but go sharply
higher to change driving habits in this country. If prices were to
increase by, say another 25 cents, then I think motorists would
possibly consider using public transportation and take other
measures.
   And I don't think that's going to happen. If it does, I don't
think it's going to remain at that level. I think the Saudis want
to prevent a third price shock. We've been through two already
(1973 and '79), and much of the OPEC producers, but particularly
the Saudis, recognize the danger in delivering such sharp increases
to the consumer.
   They're worried about consumption decreasing because if prices
go up sharply, the consumer is going to be interested again in
conservation, buying smaller cars and all of that.
   Ultimately, that would mean lower sales by the OPEC nations,
particularly those that have excess capacity and want to use more
of that capacity.

   We're going to work from a different level as to the cost of
energy than we have in the past: If it's war, you're going to be
looking at a $30-plus price for crude oil. And if it isn't war,
you're looking at $25-plus.
   As the price goes up for gasoline, the consumption goes down.
And as the price of energy goes up, the economics will bring on
alternative forms of energy.
   The first thing that comes to mind is that there's a lot of
natural gas available to us, and there should be fuel-switching to
natural gas right now from fuel oil.
   It's a lot better to buy domestic natural gas than it is to buy
foreign crude oil: One, it helps the trade deficit. But two,
natural gas sells at a discount to crude oil. That means it's
cheaper for the consumer.

   We've been in a recession for a year in housing and cars. I wish
because of this (Gulf situation) we'd get to work on the budget
deficit. We need it now more than ever and certainly (we need) an
energy policy.
   I always felt that if we taxed (gasoline) at 25 cents a gallon,
it wouldn't hurt our business at all. Fifty cents, people may buy
more fours (cylinder engines). But a nickel or a dime won't hurt,
but if it goes to 25 to 50 cents ...
   I don't think people are going to stop buying cars because of
high fuel prices. I think they are going to worry about their jobs
and the uncertainty that a recession that this Iraq situation may
bring on us. That's the big problem.

   While the president used the words ``energy conservation'' as
U.S. troops were on their way to the Persian Gulf, in a year and a
half in office he has failed to propose any significant policies to
reduce dependence on imported oil. Indeed, the steady rise in U.S.
oil imports during the Reagan administration has continued during
the Bush presidency.
   Means are available to reverse this trend. We can make our cars,
buildings and industries far more fuel-efficient than they are
today. And we can gradually develop clean renewable fuels to run
our vehicles. The ques in encouraging more oil production, in
delivering less costly natural gas, and development of synthetic
fuels will be governed by price considerations. So will
conservation, which will be ultimately regulated by energy
regulation and cost. Realistically, nuclear energy must be
re-examined as a significant, expanded domestic energy source, with
the safeguards we proposed in the '70s.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Westerners living in Tokyo are not adequately
described by the word ``minority.''
   ``Singularity'' might be closer.
   Despite Tokyo's cosmopolitan reputation and the government's
endless talk of kokusaika, or internationalization, diversity in
the capital city runs mostly to products, not people.
   No need to take a survey. Just ride the subway or train at rush
hour.
   Walk through the Ginza, Tokyo's famed shopping street, on a
Sunday afternoon during tourist season.
   There, in gleaming storefronts, are Gucci, Guy Laroche and
Benetton, Dunkin' Donuts, Shakey's Pizza, Dairy Queen and the
omnipresent Colonel. The occasional Westerner often looks confused
in the relentless tide of Japanese.
   ``Kokusaika is just a media buzzword; most ordinary Japanese are
still wondering what we're doing here,'' said anthropologist
Theodore Bestor, author of ``Neighborhood Tokyo.''
   ``While to your eyes there may be few Westerners, to their eyes
it doesn't seem that way because it's gone from nearly zero to tens
of thousands in several years.''
   The scarcity of one's kind is rarely mentioned in conversation.
After all, Eisaku Sato, then prime minister, declared in the 1970s
that Japan was a member of the West, and Tokyo's governor likes to
call this a ``world city.''
   It doesn't seem that way when wide-eyed toddlers, clasping a
parent's leg, point to you and exclaim, ``Foreigner! Foreigner!''
   The number of North Americans and Europeans living in Tokyo rose
from 17,550 in 1979 to 27,630 last year, about two-hundredths of 1
percent of its 12 million people, according to the Justice Ministry.

   Britain's Prince Charles, known for lambasting modern
architecture, would find no audience here. Tokyo celebrates the
new. A landmark is where you put down stakes for the bulldozer.
   ``Prewar'' apartment buildings, prized in New York, are derided
as has-beens. They certainly are rare, having fallen victim
successively in this century to earthquake, war and Tokyo's
everlasting construction boom.
   Real estate agents divide what in America are known as apartment
buildings into high-quality ``manshons'' (the new) and ``apaatos''
(the old). They dismiss the latter with the disparaging ``made of
wood.''
   The Tokyo skyline drones on, a vast tangle of 12-story slabs of
concrete and brick, elevated highways and railroad tracks that
stretches to the horizon. The excitement is in occasionally
finding, nestled within, the graceful tiled eaves of a Buddhist
temple or Shinto shrine.
   Tokyo burned in the great earthquake of 1923 and burned again in
1945.
   ``It is not a place that people feel has a whole lot of past.
Whatever's here is often what ... was thrown up hastily after the
other buildings burned down,'' said Patricia Steinhoff, a
University of Hawaii sociologist.
   Construction is everywhere. Under the crush of 30 million people
in the city and suburbs, Tokyo is building homes over freeways, on
man-made islands and next to cemeteries that soon will feature
gravestones squeezed together into walls to save space.
   It's crowded. A reporter searching for an apartment walked into
a bedroom and came face-to-face with a truck.
   The Shuto expressway turned at that point and the truck, just 50
yards away, rushed passed the picture window, followed by dozens of
others.

   Nothing like a few weeks of walking around Tokyo to clear up
some of the mystery surrounding the U.S.-Japan trade imbalance.
   It seems puzzling at first that there is a problem. Department
store shelves are filled with American-made products whose Japanese
counterparts are rarely, if ever, seen in the United States.
   Food and hygiene products are big, for example. Gillette,
Revlon, Kraft, Heinz, even Tabasco sauce are found everywhere from
the corner mom-and-pop to the huge Tokyu department store chain.
   Those products don't cost much, however, and you don't see many
U.S.-made items that do. No Fords or Chevys, for instance.
   Japanese companies export big-ticket, high-tech products to the
United States. American companies that succeed here, except for IBM
and a few others, provide lower-priced goods.
   To some extent, therefore, the trade imbalance becomes a matter
of simple arithmetic.
   ``The products most important for America's industrial future _
such competitive high-technology products as semiconductors,
supercomputers, satellites and telecommunications equipment, in
contrast to such consumer products as razor blades and laundry
detergent _ have the most difficulty penetrating the Japanese
market,'' Glen Fukushima, former U.S. trade representative for
Japan and China, said in a magazine interview.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   If the Japanese sometimes seem unfriendly on subways, it may be
because they're sleeping.
   Tokyo seems a city exhausted. Whether at morning rush-hour or
midday, subway snoozers easily outnumber those in New York, where
people usually ride with all senses on full alert.
   Young and old, men and women can be seen catnapping while seated
straightbacked on the velveteen cushions, or even swaying on straps.
   The low crime rate may have something to do with it.
   ``New York subways are too dangerous,'' said a rider who
identified himself as Yasu. ``People here are more relaxed.''

   Rinchinsanbuu and his family stood
proudly beside their white herder's tent, sheep grazing nearby. He
could envision no better life.
   ``I take care of 100 cows and 300 sheep,'' said Rinchinsanbuu,
51. ``I have 15 children. I have spent my life in the countryside.
I want to stay as a herdsman.''
   Herdsmen, and with them Mongolia's cultural legacies, face an
uncertain future.
   Mongolia once was a nation of nomadic herders, but fewer than 40
percent of its 2 million people now herd their horses, sheep,
cattle and camels across the vast Central Asian steppe.
   Those who remain herders, like Rinchinsanbuu, are constricted by
the borders of state farms and agricultural cooperatives, which
have owned most of Mongolia's livestock since the Communists took
over in 1921.
   New democratic parties that recently won a voice in government
want to give the animals back to the herdsmen and allow freer
grazing. That, plus the concern of the new parties for reviving
traditional culture, would reinforce the old ways.
   Both the new groups and the Communist Party, however, also want
to increase Mongolia's links to the outside world, attract foreign
investors and tourists, and introduce modern technology.
   In addition to restricting the herdsmen, communism also
cushioned them from modernity by stunting overall economic growth.
It is impossible to predict how the herding lifestyle will survive
a return to capitalism and the expected invasion of Japanese
tourists and Hong Kong television.
   The culture of Mongolian cities already is largely imported.
   Most young people wear Western clothes, and horses have given
way to motorbikes, cars and buses. Television, ballet, video
parlors and rock concerts provide entertainment for urban office
workers.
   For Rinchinsanbuu and his family, life still follows a
traditional outline.
   ``I get up at 5 a.m. and sleep at midnight,'' he said. ``I could
even say I work 25 hours a day.''
   He looks after 100 cattle and 300 sheep for the Tuya
Agricultural Cooperative and has 50 sheep, cattle and horses of his
own.
   At least three times a year, he and his family dismantle their
three round tents, called gers, pile their possessions on a
horse-drawn cart and move to new pasture.
   They cook their meals on wood-burning stoves whose pipes project
from the tops of the gers, sending thin streams of smoke into the
wide blue sky.
   Every now and then, they slaughter a sheep for food, but most of
the time they eat boiled mare's milk or strong-tasting cheese, and
bread with fresh butter or dried curds.
   Entertainment generally means listening to the radio, but there
are several festivals each year that feature Mongolian wrestling,
horse racing, archery and singing.
   Herders preserve traditional courtesies. When unexpected
visitors stopped at his summer camp on a hillside 35 miles east of
Ulan Bator, the capital, Rinchinsanbuu donned his best del, an
outer garment closed with a wide, colorful sash at the waist.
   While his wife served milk tea, he solemnly handed a snuff
bottle around.
   Rinchinsanbuu and his good friend Dashnyam laughed when asked if
it would not be easier to live in a city and work in a factory.
   ``Of course city life is quite good, because these city
residents can have anything they want in a department store,''
Dashnyam said. ``But I think we are rich. We have more fresh air,
more meat. Country life is healthy.''
   By another measure, the herders are poor. According to the
government, the average herder working for a cooperative earns
about 3,340 tugriks a year, less than $600 even at the artificially
high official exchange rate.
   Sanitation is abysmal. Flies are abundant and outhouses are
crude.
   Rinchinsanbuu is relatively wealthy. He and his grown sons own a
generator, which are few and expensive, and three televisions,
which are rare outside cities.
   Ichinkhorloo, a yak herder camped across the stream, said he
wanted electricity because ``it is very difficult to live without
light, and there is a shortage of candles.'' Ichinkhorloo said he
also wanted more pay, ``maybe 300 to 400 tugriks a month.''
   Ochir, an 80-year-old camped several miles away, said he wanted
a bigger pension. He gets 60 tugriks a month, about $10, and must
continue raising sheep because it is too little to live on.
   Like many of the older herders, Ochir hesitated to blame the
Communist Party for the poor economic conditions.
   ``I have supported this party from my childhood,'' he said. ``I
don't know about these new parties. . . . We don't know who they
are.''
   In places where the new parties campaigned extensively, the July
29 election showed herders can be open to change.
   A good example was the Gachuurt State Farm just outside Ulan
Bator, where a Communist ran for the national legislature
unopposed. Voters rejected him and a new election is being
scheduled.

   Col. William Holland's National Guard brigade
just ended three weeks of war games in the Mojave Desert, enduring
the same combat tests and 120-degree heat other troops face half a
world away _ in Saudi Arabia.
   They trained on top-of-the-line equipment to the same standards
as elite forces. Unlike Guardsmen of the past, they did not work
with hand-me-down weapons or bide their time watching training
films in stuffy classrooms.
   To skeptics who deride the Guard as second-rate weekend
warriors, Holland says his troops are ready if needed in the
Persian Gulf.
   ``I feel very confident we can give a very strong account of
ourselves,'' said Holland, 51, a plant manager of a carpet company
who doubles as commander of the 48th Mechanized Brigade of the
Georgia Army National Guard.
   ``We're red-blooded Americans. It's our patriotic duty,''
Holland said.
   President Bush this week called upon these part-time soldiers to
discharge their duty, mobilizing the reserves to bolster the
defense of Saudi Arabia.
   As many as 40,000 reservists _ from the Army and Air National
Guard, Army Reserve, Navy Reserve, Marine Reserve and Air Force
Reserve _ could be in uniform by the end of the month.
   This is the first real test of the ``Total Force'' policy
adopted when the draft ended in 1973 to make reservists full-time
partners in military planning. Not since Bunker Hill has America
depended so heavily on its citizen soldiers.
   It's also an opportunity for reservists to apply spit and polish
to a tarnished legacy from the Vietnam era, when they often were
dismissed as draft-dodgers.
   Most military experts agree that reservists are better trained,
better equipped and better motivated than were their counterparts a
generation ago. But the unanswered question is: Are they up to the
job?
   The Reserve Forces Policy Board, which rates the readiness of
citizen-soldiers for the Pentagon, says they are.
   In a 1987 report, the board said the Guard and Reserve ``are the
best they have ever been and, when provided with adequate
resources, are capable of accomplishing their wartime missions.''
   According to Pentagon ratings, 76 percent of the National Guard
and 56 percent of the Army Reserve units were able to undertake
major portions of their wartime mission in 1987. That's an 18
percent improvement from 1983.
   But Martin Binkin, a senior fellow and defense expert at the
Brookings Institution in Washington, called it ``a risky venture''
for the Pentagon.
   ``How good are they? Who knows? There are no sure answers,''
said Binkin, co-author of ``U.S. Army Guard &amp; Reserve: Rhetoric,
Realities, Risks.''
   ``They're far superior to what they were in the Vietnam period.
But there's no way of measuring in peacetime how well a unit will
perform in wartime.''
   One of his book's observations: ``On balance, the nation's
experience with mobilizing its reserve forces (since World War II)
has been disappointing.''
   When President Kennedy called up reserves during the 1961
building of the Berlin Wall, an Army study group concluded:
``Without a visible mission to perform, and without the existence
of a national emergency, these personnel increasingly had one
objective _ to go home as soon as possible.''
   Since Korea, reserves have seen more domestic duty than foreign
assignment. They mobilized five times for school integration
clashes, the Berlin Crisis, the Cuban missile crisis, the Vietnam
War and a 1970 postal strike.
   An Army study group called Vietnam ``a particularly dismal
period'' for the Guard and Reserve and said its ``ability to go to
war was near zero.''
   It wasn't so much what reserves did as what they didn't do.
   President Johnson decided not to activate the reserves when the
Vietnam buildup escalated in 1965, choosing instead to rely on the
draft.
   The reserves became a haven for thousands of college-educated
men who avoided the draft and sat out the war in relative safety.
Some reservists wore wigs to cover their long hair while counting
the days to discharge.
   Johnson did call up 35,280 reservists after the 1968 Tet
offensive _ a small fraction of the 3.4 million draftees and
enlistees who served in Vietnam.
   The most memorable reserve action of the Vietnam era happened in
Ohio, when National Guardsmen shot and killed four Kent State
University students at an anti-war rally. For the most part,
reserves made headlines only when they were killed in training
accidents with jeeps and helicopters.
   But officials say that's no longer the case.
   ``Annual training used to be an open-ended poker game and
beerfest,'' said Harry Heath, spokesman for the Georgia Department
of Defense and a retired Army colonel. ``Today, the Army and Air
National Guard are prepared to accept any challenge and will acquit
themselves competently and professionally.''
   Herbert R. Temple, former head of the National Guard Bureau, put
it this way: ``It was not but a few years ago that they said we
couldn't fight our way out of a wet paper bag. Baby, we've come a
long way.''
   Today, 1.2 million men and women serve in all branches of the
reserves. About 324,000 are in the Army Reserve and 596,000 are in
the Air and Army National Guard, more than during Vietnam.
   One high-priority combat unit is the 48th Mechanized Brigade of
the Georgia National Guard, a force of about 4,000 soldiers. It
makes up one-third of the wartime configuration of the U.S. Army's
24th Mechanized Infantry Division, which has been deployed in Saudi
Arabia. Twelve of the Army's 18 active divisions are rounded out by
a reserve brigade.
   In 1983, the 48th Brigade became the first reserve unit to train
at the Army's National Training Center in the Mojave Desert.
Members are equipped with the Abrams M-1 Tank and M-2 Bradley
Fighting Vehicle, which they received even before the regular army
division to which they are assigned.
   Their commander, Holland, is a 28-year veteran of the Guard. He
has his duffel bags packed, traveler's checks in hand and a haircut
that meets military regulations. He has assigned power of attorney
to his wife.
   ``There's just a tremendous turnaround. I wouldn't have anything
to do with the Guard the way it was,'' Holland said in a northern
Georgia drawl.
   The Center for Defense Information, a group of former military
officers critical of Pentagon spending, estimated it would cost an
extra $8.3 million a day or $3 billion a year just in salaries if
100,000 reservists were activated.
   ``They are by and large responsible and actively involved
citizens who will answer the call,'' said retired Adm. Eugene
Carroll. ``But there will be some ducking and dodging from some who
don't want to go.''
   And still, there are skeptics. Wayne McIntosh, a rifleman from
New York City discharged from the Marines in 1988, said, ``They're
civilians at heart. They have a civilian attitude. When the stuff
hits the fan, I wouldn't feel comfortable with a weekend warrior
next to me.''
   That kind of talk doesn't sit well in northern Georgia.
   ``Most people's image of a reservist was an individual trying to
beat the draft or a bunch of drunks and card-players. There's been
a complete turnaround,'' said Sgt. Alton Key, 41, of the 48th
Brigade.
   ``The morale's high. This unit has been super. We'll be prepared
to do our duty,'' Key said. ``We signed on the dotted line. We're
ready to stand in ranks.''

<HEAD>Black Ex-Mayor Out to Topple Senate's Conservative Crusader</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENNIS PATTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A black former mayor is trying this year to
do what a popular white governor could not do in 1984: topple
Republican Jesse Helms, the Senate's zealous crusader against
obscene art and homosexual causes.
   Helms is counting on his national fund-raising juggernaut and
hot-button ``values'' issues to win him a fourth term. Harvey
Gantt, his Democratic challenger, depicts himself as a champion of
what he contends are people's real concerns _ education, health
care and the environment.
   Gantt's race is one of the wild cards that keeps the contest
from being a typical conservative-liberal match-up. Another is
Helms' capacity to inspire devotion and distaste among voters in
nearly equal measure _ leaving the outcome to a small percentage of
undecideds.
   The two candidates' backgrounds are as different as their styles
and philosophies.
   Helms was a television commentator in the 1960s and became a
household name with his editorials against integration. During that
same period, Gantt became the first black student at Clemson
University.
   Gantt, an architect, also is the first black man to win his
party's Senate nomination _ and he did it by defeating white rivals
in both a primary and a June 5 runoff. He said then that Helms
would bring up the race issue ``at his own risk.''
   Helms has not mentioned race directly. But he refused to rebuke
James Meredith, a civil rights pioneer who now works on his staff,
when Meredith said national black leaders were heavily involved in
drugs.
   And Helms, in at least one television ad, has dusted off an old
Southern strategy to remind voters that his opponent is black.
   That ad ends with a photograph of Helms tagged ``North Carolina
Values'' and a photo of Gantt labeled ``Liberal Values.''
   The senator's radio and TV spots so far have featured President
Bush stumping for Helms and a grandfatherly Helms with crippled
children. Others criticize Gantt's support for abortion rights, his
opposition to the death penalty and his alleged support for five
different tax increases while serving as Charlotte's mayor.
   Some of the ads question Gantt's ``extreme liberal record,'' but
they stop short of the kind of personal, negative attacks that
Helms used against Nick Galifanikas, John Ingram and former Gov.
Jim Hunt in earlier campaigns.
   Helms, in a rare news conference, told reporters he has been
``trying to be restrained'' after Democrats predicted he would
mount a scathing, negative campaign against Gantt.
   Helms began his 1984 campaign against Hunt, then the governor,
more than a year before the election. But said he wanted to spare
the voters this time.
   ``People ought to be given some relief from politics. You may
love it,'' he told reporters, ``but they don't love it. They would
resent and regret so much emphasis on politics until after Labor
Day.''
   While Helms has used innuendo and indirect attacks, Gantt
campaign officials say the Helms-Hunt race, the most expensive and
bitter in state history, may have defused direct attacks this time
around.
   ``I think 1984 did as much to help us as anything,'' said Susan
Jetton, Gantt's press secretary. ``The negative tone of that
campaign was something people just didn't want to see again.
   ``And everybody remembers it. It sticks in their minds,'' she
said. ``People who don't follow politics know about it.''
   Gantt, in one of his own ads, takes aim at Helms' previous
campaign tactics and the record that brought him the nickname
``Senator No.''
   ``Some people are always trying to tear things down,'' Gantt
says in a TV spot that recounts his rise from a public housing
project to become the mayor of Charlotte. ``I'm an architect. We
build things.''
   Since winning the June 5 runoff, Gantt has been alternating
campaign trips to hamlets and villages with fund-raising forays
outside the state. The most recent federal reports show he had
raised $853,000 as of June 30.
   Helms, meanwhile, had continued a record-breaking pace of
fund-raising, raising some $7.9 million so far. But much of the
money is plowed back into expensive direct-mail fund-raising. He
had just over $555,000 in the bank in July.
   Helms' fund-raising letters, sent to a network of conservative
donors developed during his 18 years in the Senate, generally paint
the campaign as in crisis.
   ``Either my campaign raises $376,000 within the next 10 days, or
my campaign may very well be over,'' he said in a recent letter
sent to prospective donors by certified mail. ``Our polls show the
situation is desperate. ... And my campaign people tell me every
dollar we have in the bank will be gone within 10 days.''
   The polls show Helms and Gantt virtually deadlocked at about 45
percent of the vote each, with about 10 percent undecided.
   But that is almost a standard breakdown in any Helms campaign,
no matter who runs against the senator. Helms' biggest victory, in
1978, came with a 55 percent to 45 percent margin over Ingram. He
defeated Hunt by only a 52-48 margin despite President Reagan's
powerful appeal in 1984.
   Thad Beyle, a political science professor at the University of
North Carolina, said Gantt's poll standings could be misleading.
   ``What concerns me about the polls is the racial slippage,'' he
said. ``That's what happened in Virginia with (Gov.) Doug Wilder's
campaign _ 8 to 10 percent of the Wilder vote just disappeared on
Election Day. That's because of people who tell you they will vote
for a black man, but won't.''
   The Gantt campaign hopes his personal campaign appeals to groups
of 50 to 200 people in rural areas will help white voters stick
with Gantt.
   ``We're going into a lot of places where they've never seen a
Senate candidate before,'' Jetton said. ``A lot of the audiences
have been overwhelmingly white, and the reaction has just been
incredible.''
   Gantt will start appearing in urban areas after Labor Day, when
media coverage becomes more important, Jetton said.
   Helms said he plans to campaign in the state every weekend after
Labor Day, but it's unclear whether reporters will be welcome.
   Unlike his previous three races, Helms has not released a
schedule of his campaign activities. And campaign officials in the
last month have stopped talking to reporters, insisting that
questions be submitted in writing. When the campaign responds, the
answers come in a written statement.
   ``It's certainly his style to stay as far away from reporters as
possible,'' Beyle said of Helms. But he said this year's tactics
are unusual even for Helms.
   ``I just wonder whether there's something about having Harvey
Gantt running that may be causing them problems,'' Beyle said. ``I
don't know what those problems are, but it makes you wonder.''

<HEAD>Women Form National Support Group for Prozac Users</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Disturbing side effects patients blame on
the popular antidepressant Prozac have resulted in several
multimillion-dollar lawsuits, and a group of women have formed a
support network for those who feel adversely affected by the drug.
   ``It's a very dangerous drug, especially since people aren't
being warned about its possible side effects,'' said Janet Sims of
Noblesville, Ind., who linked her suicide attempt to the drug and
in May founded the Prozac Survivors Support Group.
   Since then, support groups have been formed in at least seven
states. An estimated 2 million people worldwide have taken the
drug. Depression afflicts an estimated 4 percent of American adults.
   Prozac, a member of the class of drugs known as fluoxetine, has
been promoted as a miracle drug with few and minor side effects,
according to Sims and other patients.
   But it can induce violent and persistent suicidal and homicidal
tendencies in people who never have experienced such thoughts
before, they say. The manufacturer and federal officials defend
Prozac.
   This summer, two patients sued the drug's manufacturer, Eli
Lilly and Co. of Indianapolis. Both allege Prozac can prompt
suicidal or aggressive behavior and that Eli Lilly failed to warn
doctors about the possibility.
   In addition, the widows of three victims of a Kentucky man who
murdered eight people at a printing company last September before
shooting himself are each suing the company for $50 milllion,
saying the aggression was linked to Prozac.
   Eli Lilly has not commented on the lawsuits.
   In her lawsuit, Rhonda Hala of Shirley, N.Y., said that within
two weeks of beginning to take Prozac, her thoughts turned to
suicide. During 18 months on the drug, she slashed herself with
razor blades and dug scissors and screws into her flesh about 150
times, she said. She tried six times to kill herself, she said.
   ``I thought I had someone else's brian in my body,'' said Mrs.
Hala, a 40-year-old school secretary.
   When she stopped taking the drug, she said, her life returned to
normal.
   In 1988, the Food and Drug Administration approved Prozac for
treatment of depression. It quickly became the most widely
dispensed antidepressant on the U.S. market.
   ``It's being given out like candy,'' said Michael O'Brien, a
spokesman for the Los Angeles-based Citizens Commission on Human
Rights, a group established by the Church of Scientology to
investigate psychiatric abuse. ``The doctors and psychiatrists are
told that the drug is incredibly safe, so they give it out for just
about any reason.''
   In the American Journal of Psychiatry in February, Dr. Martin
Teicher of Harvard University and colleagues reported that six
patients had developed violent suicidal thoughts within weeks of
taking Prozac. The problem stopped after patients stopped using the
drug.
   ``The bottom line is that Prozac is no wonder drug. It has no
extravagant claims attached to it, but it has helped a lot of
people suffering from depression appreciate the benefits of life,''
said Jerrold Rosenbaum, chief of the Psycho-Pharmcology Unit at
Massachusetts General Hospital and associate professor at Harvard
University.
   In Florida, use of the drug by former three-term Sen. Lawton
Chiles has become a topic in his campaign for governor.
   State House Speaker Tom Gustafson, the running mate of Chiles'
Democratic primary opponent, suggested that Chiles could be a
suicide risk in the governor's mansion. Candidate Bill Nelson, a
six-term congressman, distanced himself from the remark, and
Gustafson eventually apologized.
   Later, Chiles released medical records that said he never
contemplated suicide.
   FDA and Lilly officials said there have been no unusual problems
with Prozac.
   The thousands of adverse reaction reports received about Prozac
are not unusual for a drug so widely prescribed, FDA spokeswoman
Faye Peterson said. And, she said, most of those reports cite
sleeplessness and agitation, not violent behavior.
   ``We don't think there is any problem here, but we continue to
monitor it,'' she said.
   ``Unfortunately, suicidal thoughts, as well as acts of suicide,
are known risks of (depressed) patients,'' Lilly spokesman Ed West
said.
   There have been extensive clinical and post-marketing trials of
the drug, West said. ``We see no trend that suggests a causal
relationship between our product and this type of behavior,'' he
said.
   Patients who formed chapters of the support group disagree.
   Avis Martin of San Francisco said that while she was taking
Prozac, she would ``sit in my room planning out how I was going to
murder my children and then commit suicide.''
   ``It makes you think you're crazy and that the only way out is
to take more drugs,'' said Sharyn DiGeronimo, founder of a New York
support group. The groups will let people ``know that they're not
alone and that they're not crazy.''
   Bonnie Leitsch, who founded the Louisville group, said she is
convinced Prozac caused Joseph Wesbecker's rampage at a Louisville
printing plant last year. Records showed Wesbecker had been taking
the drug, but the state medical examiner, George Nichols, said
Prozac ``was not a solo drug'' and not directly responsible.
   Leitsch has taken a sabbatical from work to devote more time to
the group.
   ``Until this job is done, until this drug is off the market, I
think it's safe to say I've resigned,'' she said.

<HEAD>Acupuncture Therapy Helps First-Time Drug Offenders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SANDRA WALEWSKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unusual rehabilitation program that offers
first-time drug offenders the chance to try acupuncture treatments
is surprising officials with its success a year after it began.
   ``It's the first and last time I'm going to jail,'' Cheryl said
confidently after removing five tiny golden needles from her ears
on her 12th day of treatment.
   Cheryl 40, is working on kicking her 22-year habit through
acupuncture therapy and counseling. She agreed to talk on condition
that her full name not be used.
   The goal is to get ``people out of the jails and into
constructive lives,'' said Dade County state attorney Janet Reno.
   Cheryl said she is worried she could lose her job with the
county over her arrest but is optimistic about her treatment.
   ``I know that it works. I haven't had the urge to buy reefer
since I'm here,'' she said.
   Of about 1,500 people who have chosen the treatment in the year
it has been offered, only 16 have been arrested again, said Mae
Bryant, director of the Metro-Dade Office of Rehabilitative
Services.
   Officials say an average of 150 to 200 people a day go to two
outpatient clinics offering acupuncture.
   ``This is absolutely phenomenal. ... We couldn't get people to
come here with the promise of a meal before this,'' said Raymond
White of the county Department of Human Resources.
   Acupuncture, an Oriental practice that uses needles to treat
illness and relieve pain, is drawing people in like nothing else
has, he said.
   ``It's a nonverbal method. ... I can come in, sit, get the
service, leave and feel I'm working on recovery,'' said White,
adding that the relaxed mood brought on by acupuncture also helps
make participants more receptive to traditional counseling.
   The program is voluntary, and those who complete the year-long
period have their charges dropped and records cleared.
   Only a few cities have similar programs, and Miami's has become
a model, including for one starting this fall by courts in
Montgomery County, Ohio.
   One indicator that the Miami program is succeeding is that
almost 75 percent of those entering are staying, said Janet
Konefal, an associate professor in psychiatry at the University of
Miami and a consultant for the county. The retention rate for
outpatient drug treatment programs usually runs about 20 percent to
25 percent, she said.
   ``Traditionally, it has been thought that people with crack
problems couldn't be treated on an outpatient basis,'' White said.
``For whatever reason, acupuncture seems desirable enough for the
clients that they keep coming back.''
   ``We don't know how it works, but we know it works,'' said
Carlos Alvarez, an addiction counselor at the Lincoln Hospital
division of substance abuse in the New York City borough of the
Bronx. That program also uses acupuncture combined with counseling
and social rehabilitation for drug and alcohol patients.
   Cities all over the world are expressing interest in acupuncture
for drug treatment, Alvarez said.
   Lynn Hankes, director of the addiction treatment program at
South Miami Hospital, said acupuncture is not currently used in
mainstream addiction medicine, but could be effective in some cases.
   ``Its main therapeutic effect is during the detoxification
period,'' he said, adding that the long-term effects need to be
studied.
   Like other drug offenders taken directly from court to the
clinic in a Corrections van, a 26-year-old Homestead man wasn't
sure what to expect from his first session.
   ``Do they stick them in all the way?'' he asked nervously while
holding tightly to a package of tiny needles.
   Acupuncture aims to redistribute the body's energy flow or
stimulate the production of chemicals often depleted through drug
abuse in order to achieve a calming effect, practitioners say.
   In the Dade County program, the five points where needles are
inserted are linked to certain areas of the body: the sympathetic,
which is tied to the central nervous system; the senmen, to the
spirit; the kidney; liver; and lung. The ears were chosen because
they are convenient and sensitive, said Van Yuan, the program's
chief acupuncturist.
   After a certified acupuncturist inserts five needles into each
ear, the participant sits quietly for 45 minutes to an hour.
   The direct effect is to stimulate the body's own tranquilizing
system, chemical changes in the body to help a person to relax and
reduce muscle tension, Hankes said.
   ``Overall, they begin to get a sense of well-being and cravings
are decreased,'' said Ms. Konefal.
   In the first four months, participants must attend the clinic
two to three times a week after an initial 12 consecutive visits.
Their urine is tested on each visit and they can get acupunture
therapy. In the final stretch, education and career counseling also
are offered. The county-funded program costs about $500 per year
per person.
   County officials are discussing expanding the $1.2 million
program, but first want to find out exactly how well it is working.
Some answers may come from a three-year $1 million study being
funded by the National Institute of Drug Abuse and conducted by Ms.
Konefal.

<HEAD>Children's Trail Recalling '88 Fires Moving Forward in Yellowstone</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KURT J. REPANSHEK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yellowstone National Park
officials are turning to a fictional mountain man of the 1800s to
guide children along a nature trail reflecting the force of 1988's
firestorms.
   Joshua Grimes, the craggy ol' mountain man created by writer
Sandra Chisholm Robinson to recount the natural and human history
of Yellowstone National Park, will resume his storytelling along
the Children's Fire Trail next month.
   ``Yallerstone's a powerful place with more tales to tell than
even an ol' timer like me could ever l'arn,'' Grimes tells visitors
in a tape-recorded message being installed at the start of the
boardwalk trail.
   ``But the story of fire ... heh, heh, that story sure do shine.''
   Grimes will tell that shining story through a dozen interpretive
displays being erected along the trail.
   He'll note the baked boulders, charred trees and sterilized
soils that serve as reminders of the fires that caught the world's
attention. And Grimes will point to nature's recuperative powers _
the floral bursts of fireweed and lupine, the lodgepole seedlings,
the aspen shoots.
   The trail, located roughly six miles east of Mammoth Hot Springs
on the Blacktail Plateau, is a tribute to the scores of children
throughout the country who in 1988 wondered how they could help
Yellowstone recover from the once-in-a-lifetime fires.
   The wildfires blackened roughly half of Yellowstone's 2.2
million acres and at various times forced the closure of some of
the park's lodgings, although none of the geologic features or
historic buildings were damaged. Sparked both by lightning and
careless humans, the fires grew to historic proportions as a result
of the summer's extremely hot, dry and windy conditions.
   Many children wanted to send pine cones and seedlings to the
park to help reforest burned areas, but park policy dictating that
the areas recover naturally made those offers inappropriate. So
instead, the National Park Service decided to build the trail and
suggested that students interested in helping Yellowstone raise
funds for the project.
   So far those donations have covered about $6,000 of the
project's $125,500 estimated cost.
   As children and others wind their way down the trail, they'll
see living trees interspersed with charred skeletons of trees, some
scattered about the forest floor, others towering like blackened
totem poles.
   They'll be able to run their hands across boulders that stood in
the path of the Wolf Lake Fire and see how the rocks protected
their northern faces while the southern faces are shedding slivers
of rock literally baked by the flames.
   A series of photographs taken Sept. 9, 1988, the day the fire
stormed the area, will be on display since the rapid growth of
wildflowers has obscured some traces of the flames.
   ``We'll have copies of those photographs, because when you look
at it now, it's very tough to tell there was a fire,'' said Ranger
Joe Zarki, who is overseeing development of the trail.
   Revegetation of the area also will be described by some of the
panels, one of which will explain how sagebrush that burned two
years ago now is affecting the regrowth, Zarki said.
   Since sagebrush burns hotter than surrounding grasses, explained
the ranger, soil closer to the bush was sterilized and will take
longer to again be able to sustain plants. Vegetation around these
bushes is actually coming back in concentric circles _ greening up
from the outside in, he said.
   Stands of aspen and lodgepole pine surrounding the trail are
evidence that while fire can destroy trees, it can also create
life, the ranger said. When exposed to heat lodgepole pine cones
expand, allowing the seeds they cup to drop to the ground where
they can germinate, said Zarki.
   Aspens, meanwhile, redirect their energies when they burn, the
ranger said.
   ``If the (above ground) tree dies, all the energy ... goes into
producing growth in the (roots') shoots,'' he said. ``One of the
exhibits will talk just about that reproductive ecology of the
aspen.''
   Nearby migratory routes for elk, bison, pronghorn antelope and
mule deer also will be noted, as will the attractiveness of the
burned area to hawks, nuthatches, bluebirds and wrens.
   ``Fires produce dead trees that are good nesting sites for
hole-nesting birds,'' such as tree swallows, said Zarki.
   Park officials hope those who meander along the boardwalk gain
an appreciation for Yellowstone's rapidly changing world.
   ``The fast-moving fires of 1988 made changes to the land that
are quickly being altered by the passing seasons,'' reads the last
panel that will be placed at the end of the trail. ``Each minute
brings new changes to the park, helping make Yellowstone the
special place that it is.
   ``Change belongs to Yellowstone as much as the rocks, the trees,
the wind. Nothing ever stays the same.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tales of 120-year-old yogurt eaters with the
boundless energy of adolescents made memorable television
commercials and fed the notion that even if it is not the key to
eternal youth, yogurt sure is healthy.
   Hence workers lunching at their desks with little containers of
fruit-flavored yogurt, or shoppers choosing frozen yogurt over ice
cream, or parents getting their kids to snack on yogurt. Americans
eat 4.6 pounds per person annually, a 110 percent increase in 10
years, according to the National Yogurt Association.
   Yogurt is healthy, but that doesn't mean it is calorie-,
sugar-or fat-free.
   To keep down fat consumption, buy low- or no-fat yogurt. Read
labels carefully, especially on frozen yogurt containers, to make
sure there is no unwanted added fat or sugar.
   Add fruit or other flavorings to plain yogurt; use it plain to
replace sour cream or mayonnaise in sauces and dips. It also will
work in marinades and in many recipes for bread or other baked
goods.
   However, it will curdle if put into hot liquids. Whipping it can
break the curd and make the yogurt watery.
   There is a significant difference in calories and fat content
among the various types and brands of yogurt. A cup of non-fat
plain yogurt has 90 to 110 calories, none from fat. Flavored
yogurts can have as many as 270 calories a cup, and some varieties
get more than a third of their calories from fat.
   Yogurt, fermented milk with living microbes, was not discovered
by hippies who made it in communes. It has been eaten for at least
4,000 years in many parts of the world. Throughout the Middle East,
women moving to a foreign place traditionally carried a bit of
starter culture to ferment milk, the Yogurt Association said.
   It is the action of live cultures that converts milk into yogurt
and the natural bacteria that gives yogurt its distinctive taste.
The specific type of culture used needn't be listed on the label,
which will distinguish between living cultures and those that have
been killed through pasteurization.
   Inactive cultures are thought to lose their therapeutic benefit,
Jean Carper said in her book, ``The Food Pharmacy.''
   No one has documented extraordinary longevity based on yogurt
consumption, but early this century, Nobel Prize-winning scientist
Elias Metchnikoff argued that eating fermented milk would
counteract disease-causing microbial putrefaction in the
intestines, Carper said.
   People long have used yogurt to ward off or fight intestinal
troubles. Carper said some studies have suggested yogurt may help
boost the immune system. Research has been initiated into possible
links to managing or preventing some forms of cancer.
   The calcium in yogurt is helpful to people who are allergic to
milk because of a lactose intolerance. They often can eat yogurt
without difficulty. Calcium may help prevent the debilitating bone
disease osteoporosis.
   One cup of low-fat yogurt provides 415 milligrams of calcium.
The recommended dietary allowance is 1,200 milligrams for people
ages 11 to 24 and during pregnancy and lactation,, 800 milligrams
for people ages 1 to 10 and over 24, and 400 to 600 milligrams for
infants.
   A cup of milk has 290 milligrams of calcium; four ounces of tofu
contain 154 milligrams.

   Here's how to make Yogurt Cheese, from ``The Healing Foods,'' by
Patricia Hausman and Judith Benn Hurley:
   Line a strainer with good-quality paper towels and set it in the
sink. Add 4 cups plain low-fat yogurt and drain overnight. What's
left in the strainer is the cheese.
   Makes about 1{ cups of yogurt cheese, which can be used as cream
cheese.

<HEAD>Diabetes Rates Rising in Europe But Not U.S., Study Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Diabetes rates have been rising in Europe and
New Zealand but not in North America, bolstering suspicions that
some environmental factor may promote the disease, a study says.
   The research focused on the most serious kind of diabetes, in
which a person must inject himself with insulin daily to stay
alive. About 1 million Americans are estimated to have this form.
   Genes are partly responsible, but scientists also suspect some
kind of environmental trigger like a virus or something in a
child's diet.
   The new work is reported in the July issue of the journal
Diabetes by scientists from 10 countries and the World Health
Organization. It focused on data from 1966 to 1986.
   In Leicestershire, England, rates rose 11.5 percent a year for
children up to age 4, 12.2 percent for children ages 5 to 9, and
2.6 percent for children ages 10 to 14, researchers said.
   In other locations, increases were similar among the three age
groups. Diabetes rose 10.1 percent among white children in
Auckland, New Zealand, but showed no trend among Maori and
Polynesian populations.
   Other increases included 5.6 percent in Wielkopolska, Poland,
5.1 percent in Austria, 3.7 percent in Sweden, 3.4 percent in
Finland and 2.8 percent in Norway. Although the percentage rises
were faster in Europe than in Scandinavia, Europe's diabetes levels
were only a third to a fifth of Scandinavia's to begin with,
researchers said.
   Rates in Hokkaido, Japan, were up 6.3 percent.
   No significant trend appeared in samples from Alabama, Colorado,
Minnesota, North Dakota and Pennsylvania. Researchers cautioned
that they may have overlooked a trend because of too little data.

<HEAD>`Epilepsy' Was Really Temper Tantrums, Doctors Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 26-year-old man admitted to a hospital for an
apparent epileptic seizure actually was throwing a temper tantrum,
researchers say.
   The episode occurred as he spoke to a woman who was selling him
a house he thought was in poor condition.
   Other attacks occurred after he accused his girlfriend of
infidelity and, in a later marriage, after an argument with his
wife, researchers report in the journal Psychosomatics.
   The man's tantrums ``periodically are misdiagnosed as
epilepsy,'' wrote researchers from the Baystate Medical Center in
Springfield, Mass., College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass.,
and the University of Massachusetts Medical School.
   The man was hospitalized after he felt a sharp abdominal pain,
and then began thrashing and bucking. Brain tests found no sign of
epilepsy.
   In a hospital interview with a mental health worker, he began to
feel stomach pain again as he described painful childhood
experiences. He asked to stop the interview, and when urged to
continue, he ``proceeded to have a dramatic temper tantrum,''
researchers said.
   ``Temper tantrums in adulthood generally are truncated and
thinly disguised, such as when a person kicks a flat tire, or when
a tennis player hurls his racquet,'' they wrote. ``For some
individuals, such as this patient, temper tantrums may be virtually
indistinguishable from those of children.''

<TEXT>
   David Burke, president of the CBS News division,
will be leaving this week, sources at the network said Wednesday
night.
   Burke, 54, a former ABC News executive vice president who joined
CBS in August 1988, didn't return phone calls Wednesday night, nor
did Tom Goodman, Burke's chief spokesman.
   It was unclear if Burke was being forced out or was resigning of
his own accord.
   One CBS source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, quoted
network executives as saying the reclusive Burke had told them he
was leaving, but gave no reason.
   ``Nobody seems to know why he's going,'' the source said.
   Another source, speaking of Burke's imminent departure, said
Burke has had philosophical differences with CBS Inc. President
Laurence A. Tisch. Pressure from Tisch to cut costs at CBS News led
to the firing of more than 200 staffers in 1987.
   Tisch didn't return phone calls.
   Burke's departure may be announced Thursday, sources said.
Speculation on his likely successor includes Eric Ober, a former
CBS News executive who now heads the company's stations division.
   CBS News, after more than five years of well-publicized internal
turmoil, recently had been scoring successes with its coverage of
the Persian Gulf crisis, highlighted by anchorman Dan Rather's
reports from Iraq.
   While the revamped ``CBS Morning News'' has remained third in
morning news show ratings, Rather's ``CBS Evening News'' has been a
respectable second to ABC's ``World News Tonight'' for several
months.
   Burke, a former top aide to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
came into the news business late in his career when hired by ABC
News President Roone Arledge. At CBS News, Burke succeeded Howard
Stringer, who now is president of the CBS Broadcast Group and
headed CBS news after the ouster of Van Gordon Sauter, now a TV
producer in Los Angeles.
   There had been rumors for several weeks within CBS News that
Burke was leaving.
   But when asked about them earlier Wednesday, Goodman, his
spokesman, said that as far as he knew there was nothing to them.
   Burke's exit would mark the second high-level change in network
news this summer.
   Earlier this month, former Los Angeles Times Publisher Tom
Johnson succeeded Burt Reinhardt, 70, as president of Ted Turner's
Atlanta-based Cable News Network.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   In this summer of swooning markets, what
possible incentive could a conservative, income-minded investor
find to consider venturing into stocks?
   Not much, it would certainly appear, if the subject in question
is ``playing the market'' in the hope of fun and profit. Such
rewards have been in very short supply of late, and the risks that
go with them have been painfully plain to see.
   But with a different objective, and a correspondingly different
strategy, the picture looks less grim _ at least as it is painted
by an analyst at the nation's largest investment advisory service.
   Milton Schlein, associate research director at the Value Line
Investment Survey, set out to compare the relative merits of bonds
and electric utility stocks, two popular vehicles among investors
seeking a steady stream of income from their savings.
   The two have much in common _ including relatively generous
yields and a tendency to rise or fall in price mainly in inverse
reaction to the ups and downs of interest rates.
   But after examining the behavior of these two species over the
past 13 years, Schlein finds enough disparity in their performances
to draw this conclusion: ``History suggests that utility stocks
have been superior total return holdings to bonds whether rates
were going up or down.''
   The 1977-89 period Schlein chose for his study witnessed a wide
variety of financial environments: An upsurge in interest rates and
inflation (from '77 to '81); a sharp decline in rates (between '81
and '86), and, most recently, a protracted stretch of relatively
stable rates.
   In both the rising-rate and falling-rate environments, he found,
utility stock prices fared significantly better than those of
bonds. Since 1986, he said, the performance of the two has been
about equal.
   The utilities' biggest advantage, Schlein says, seems to be
increases in their dividends, which give them a measure of
inflation protection that isn't available with the fixed interest
payments made on bonds.
   In addition, he observes, utility stocks aren't encumbered by
what he describes as two restraints on the appeal of bonds.
   Many bonds come with call provisions that allow their issuers to
buy them back at specified times. In addition, bonds typically have
a specified maturity date when they are redeemed for their face
value in cash.
   Both these characteristics limit the appeal of a good many bonds
as a means of ``locking in'' yields for an extended period of time.
   On the other side of the ledger, utility-stock yields aren't as
secure as those of bonds. A utility that runs into trouble is
almost certain to lower or eliminate the dividend on its stock
before it would take the more drastic step of interrupting its
contractual interest payments to bondholders.
   And some utilities do get into trouble, as witness the many
cases in recent years of problems at nuclear power projects.
   To minimize this risk, Value Line recommends choosing among
utility stocks whose yields hover around the average for the
industry, avoiding both the high and low extremes.
   ``Why do we favor the middle of the pack? Because it describes
the most balanced course of investment,'' Schlein concludes.
   ``In our view, yields much above the norm imply an unusual
degree of risk, typically in the form of heavy construction
programs and regulatory uncertainties.''
   By contrast, with the stock of a utility in peak financial
condition, Schlein says, the price of ultra-safety is likely to be
a poor return in dividend yield.
   ``We assume that most utility investors _ especially those using
these stocks as a bond substitute _ are concerned with drawing as
high a current income as possible within their tolerance for
risk,'' Schlein says.
   ``For a top-flight utility, the current yield is usually
subpar.''

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tepito, the infamous smugglers' market, is
suffering an identity crisis.
   Mexico has thrown its doors open to imports, making Sonys and
Mars Bars legal. Yesterday's contraband is available at stores with
names like Super Gringo.
   What's a smuggler to do?
   Cut prices. Build a shopping center. Offer cheap parking.
   ``Tepitenos have always had a keen sense of timing, an eye for
opportunity,'' said Miguel Galan, president of the Confederation of
Tepito Merchant Associations.
   In the 1970s, when Mexico was flush with oil money, Tepito
became known as the place to buy contraband, known as fayuca.
   Tough import restrictions meant only smugglers could supply the
booming consumer demand for Japanese televisions and stereos, for
shampoo and sweets made in the U.S.A.
   Residents of Tepito, a scrappy inner-city slum, were glad to
oblige.
   It became a place where guts and a pickup could make a prince of
a pauper. Tepitenos streamed back and forth across the U.S. border
like ants, buying off police and customs officers.
   ``Fayuca flourished because it was good business for everybody:
customs, the police, the Tepitenos, the consumers,'' Galan said.
   Things began to change after Mexico joined the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, in 1986. President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari has further eased import restrictions since taking office
in 1988.
   Most of merchandise in Tepito, which specializes in electronics,
now is imported legally because ``people realized it was easier to
pay taxes than to make payoffs,'' Galan said in an interview.
   The prospect of legitimacy has spawned ambitious visions of
direct imports from Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea. It
evokes dreams of conventional grandeur.
   Galan proudly unfurled an architect's rendering of a five-story,
172,000-square-foot commercial center that would replace the maze
of stalls, booths and shops run by thousands of people whose
families have done business here for generations.
   ``We need 4,000 parking spaces, minimum,'' Galan said.
   Is it possible that infamous Tepito, home to 14,000 merchants,
could become just another shopping mall?
   On the surface, the district seems to have changed little. It
hums with the raffish energy that made it legend.
   Housewives haggle with hustlers; carts jam the streets, laden
with products as diverse as fresh donuts and eggs of endangered
turtles. Pickpockets prey on the unwary in a bruising din of
radios, stereos, televisions, video players and Nintendos.
   Merchandise still changes hands on a cash-only,
don't-even-think-of-asking-for-a-receipt-or-warranty basis.
   Tomorrow's Tepito already seems to be evolving, however. Since
Mexico opened its borders, small-time smugglers have been largely
replaced by bulk importers, legitimate and otherwise.
   ``There used to be thousands of people bringing stuff across the
border,'' said Alejandra Escareno, a third-generation Tepitena.
``Now there are only a handful of big guys. They bring in stuff by
the trailer load, put it in their warehouses and sell it to small
vendors.''
   Escareno, 42, said small-timers can't offer competitive prices,
so she quit dealing in electronics when it became legal.
   ``How could we compete when we had 10 televisions and they had
100?'' she asked. Escareno went back to the family's old line: used
clothes, another time-honored business in Tepito.
   Tepito is a scavenger on the edges of Mexican history. For
decades, it was like a quirky mirror that reflected the silver
lining instead of the cloud.
   ``There has always been a special kind of person here who could
figure out how to keep ahead of the game,'' Tepito historian
Alfonso Hernandez y Hernandez said in a recent interview with the
newspaper La Jornada.
   Its open-air markets emerged after the desperate years of the
1910-1920 Revolution. Craftsmen displaced by war settled in Tepito
and survived by patching old clothes and shoes.
   World War II shortages rekindled the demand for refurbished
items, and then came the postwar years of growth.
   As people moved into Mexico City's new suburbs, Tepitenos
snapped up their discarded possessions.
   ``They cast off their old things in the rush to be `modern',''
Galan said, running a hand over the huge, claw-footed desk his
father had found. ``Tepito became known as the place to get
bargains on antiques.''
   Businessmen like Galan, who quit living in Tepito after he made
a fortune in pirated cassettes, sometimes are described as
insensitive to its special nature.
   Most Tepitenos are fiercely loyal to the neighborhood, which
already was a teeming slum when Spanish conquerors arrived in 1519.
   The spirit that bred its smugglers also has spawned writers,
painters and poets. Some fear legitimacy may be the one thing this
barrio of about 400,000 people cannot survive.
   Escareno considered Galan's vision of megashopping, parking lots
and computerized marketing, and said:
   ``Tepito is a special place. The community is very united. But
it just wouldn't be the same.''

   Next time you push that button on your computer
to send a co-worker a racy electronic mail message about the boss,
think twice.
   Someone may be reading your mail.
   Every day, millions of computer users send electronic messages
to fellow employees, supervisors, clients and friends. Many assume
these computer-to-computer electronic mail systems _ the postal
system of the Information Age _ are confidential.
   But a recent lawsuit challenges that notion. The suit contends a
California company spied on employees for months by monitoring
thousands of their electronic messages.
   The class-action suit, filed last month by several employees
against Epson America Inc. of Torrance, Calif., claims the
company's computer operations manager made printed copies of
electronic mail sent and received by 700 Epson workers. The suit
claims such snooping violates a state wiretap law.
   Epson, a Japanese-owned company that sells personal computers,
calls the lawsuit unfounded.
   ``It is clearly not the policy of Epson to indiscriminately read
electronic mail,'' said spokeman Scot Edwards. He declined to
comment on the suit's specific allegations.
   The suit is just the latest example of a growing privacy debate
surrounding electronic mail, or ``E-mail,'' which mushroomed in
popularity over the past decade along with the growth in personal
computers. Among other cases:
   _ The mayor of Colorado Springs, Colo., caused a stir earlier
this year when it was discovered he had been reading printouts of
electronic messages that City Council members sent each other in
confidence.
   _ The Iran-Contra affair unraveled partly because investigators
discovered electronic messages sent by Lt. Col. Oliver North and
supporters. The North team didn't realize every message had been
stored on computer tape.
   Computer experts say some E-mail systems automatically destroy
electronic messages once they are read, while others keep a copy.
   But even systems that erase old messages aren't safe from
snoops. In most systems, computer room operators can read messages
that haven't yet been opened by recipients, said Mike Zisman,
president of SoftSwitch Inc., a Wayne, Pa., company that helps
corporations link E-mail systems.
   ``When you send a message, most people think it's as private as
sending it through the U.S. Postal System. But in some companies it
can be as private as writing it on the bathroom wall,'' said David
Atlas, an E-mail analyst at International Data Corp., a high-tech
research firm.
   Atlas said he knows of another suit similar to the Epson class
action, as well as employees at two other companies who are
considering their own lawsuits, but he declined to identify them.
   Few employers have explicit policies on the use and privacy of
E-mail, said Walter Ulrich, an office automation specialist at the
consulting firm Arthur D. Little Inc.
   ``That's an area where companies should give guidance to
employees,'' said Ulrich, who estimates there are 10 million E-mail
users in North America.
   Ulrich recommended companies state they will not snoop in E-mail
systems unless they believe users are using them illegally or
abusively.
   ``It is unhealthy to go on a fishing expedition,'' he said.
   But Ulrich said he doesn't think companies should be barred
outright from reading E-mail. He argued that since the companies
own the computer systems, they therefore own the information
created on them.
   The American Civil Liberties Union takes a stronger stance
against E-mail snooping. It believes federal privacy safeguards are
needed to prevent employers from eavesdropping on employees'
personal affairs that happen to be contained in computer files.
   ``There's virtually no law that would stop any employer from
sytematically reading all of the computerized information of any of
their employees,'' said Lewis Maltby, coordinator of the ACLU's
National Task Force on Civil Liberties in the Work Place.
   Federal laws that bar wiretapping don't apply to computer
systems, Maltby said.
   Ulrich said E-mail users need not worry about the security of
electronic messages sent long distance over systems such as MCI
Mail, which link corporate E-mail systems nationwide. Federal law
as well as the design of these systems prevent snooping, he said.
   The electronic-mail issue is part of a broader concern about the
use of technology to monitor workers. Word processors, reservations
agents and others have complained about systems that allow
supervisors to secretly watch their work.
   Despite privacy concerns, E-mail experts contend the systems
have vastly improved the way business operates, eliminating missed
phone calls, postal delays and time-zone lags that hamper
communication among far-flung workers. They also say E-mail has
changed the way some businesses operate by allowing group
``discussions'' via computer that formerly would have been nearly
impossible.

<HEAD>Consider Holding Informal Weekend Talks in Vienna</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six of the 13 OPEC nations might gather
informally this weekend at the cartel's Vienna headquarters to
consider soaring oil prices, sources said.
   The idea of the consultations is apparently an attempt at a
compromise between those countries which want an emergency meeting
of all the cartel's members and those which do not.
   On Monday, OPEC announced that there was no majority support for
a Saudi Arabian request to call an urgent meeting.
   Word of the possible informal meeting came Wednesday as the
price of oil on world markets climbed to levels not seen since the
mid-80s. In crude-oil trading at the New York Mercantile Exchange,
for example, prices surged over the $31 a barrel level, a 72
percent gain since the crisis erupted Aug. 2.
   Indonesia has proposed the meeting in Vienna for Sunday, said
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The sources stressed that no final decision has yet been made on
whether to meet.
   ``It may or may not be held,'' said one source. ``If it is, it
will be very, very informal.'' No decisions could be made at the
gathering, he said.
   Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Hisham Nazer, said last Saturday
that his country intended to increase oil production by 2 million
barrels a day with or without OPEC's approval. The increase would
make up about half of the loss of some 4 million barrels a day
caused by the international embargo on Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil that
followed Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Nazer had urged the cartel to hold an emergency session to
discuss the situation. The United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Venezuela
and Ecuador were said to support his plea.
   Iran's oil minister, Gholamreza Aqazadeh, said he opposed an
emergency meeting because there was enough crude in storage to make
up for the loss of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude.
   Under the Indonesia proposal, the sources said Iran, Saudi
Arabia, Nigeria, Algeria, Indonesia and Venezuela would gather for
the informal talks.
   Those nations represent two committees recently set up by the
cartel to monitor oil production.
   In its statement Monday, OPEC said Algerian Mining Minister
Sadek Boussena, the cartel's president, would hold consultations
with some ministers before the end of the month. It did not
elaborate.
   Meanwhile, industry sources in Venezuela said Wednesday that
country was accelerating plans to boost oil production by at least
300,000 barrels daily, and filling its storage facilities at home
and overseas to have extra output available as soon as authorities
allow more production.
   Venezuela, whose OPEC quota is about 1.9 million barrels a day,
has been lobbying for a formal OPEC meeting to sanction increased
output.
   Saudi Arabia, which pumps about a quarter of the cartel's oil,
has an OPEC-set production quota of just under 5.4 million barrels
a day.
   At their summer conference last month, OPEC ministers agreed to
limit their output to 22.5 million barrels a day in the last half
of the year to try to push crude prices up to $21 a barrel.
   With the gulf crisis, the average price of a basket of crudes
monitored by the group surged last week to $25.29 a barrel.
   The next formal meeting of the organization is not scheduled
until mid-December.

<HEAD>Tokyo Dealers Mostly Pessimistic About Market Future</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the stock market nosedives and rising interest
rates begin to take their toll, analysts expect tougher times for
the Japanese economy.
   Most market dealers remained pessimistic about future trends on
an already bearish Tokyo market. But some said the continuing
strength of the Japanese yen against the dollar was among signs
that the economy was fundamentally sound.
   The Nikkei Stock Average posted its ninth-largest fall ever
Wednesday, dropping 1,086.93 points and finished this morning's
session with a fall of nearly 1,000 points.
   ``The biggest problem is that interest rates are going up,''
said Masumi Murakami, manager of Nikko Securities' over-the-counter
stock division. High yields, he said, were drawing money from the
stock market.
   He added that the Middle East crisis had ``really compounded
domestic inflationary problems,'' making further increases in
interest rates necessary.
   The benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese government bond has gone
from 7.480 percent on Aug. 1 to more than 8.2 percent by midweek.
   Increased interest payments will slow down capital expenditures
by businesses and in turn slow down growth, he said. The Japanese
economy's annual growth rate would then cool from 5 percent to 4.5
percent, Dodds predicted.
   Bruce Johnson, head of the research division at Baring
Securities, said the Persian Gulf crisis also had the potential of
eating away manufacturers' profit margins through rising oil prices
and higher inflation.
   The stock market's plunge presents a serious problem for Japan's
commercial banks, said Roger Gough, a banking analyst at Baring
Securities.
   Most of the country's largest banks have large ``hidden''
portfolios of stock issues which they count as assets. When share
prices decline, such assets lose value and the banks have to make
up for losses to maintain internationally recognized reserve
requirements.
   Gough said many of Japan's top banks are slipping below the
reserve requirement and predicted difficulty in making up the
losses without increasing interest rates and obtaining cash at high
expense.
   Still, some Japanese remain positive.
   One financial source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the continuing strength of the yen against the dollar, despite
international uncertainty, revealed faith in the strength of the
Japanese economy.
   ``I think that's a bright sign,'' he said.
   ``The Japanese economy is not weak. Though there may be some
negative factors, it doesn't use (too much energy) and the damage
from oil price increases will be small,'' said Nikko's Murakami.

   Corporations have become confidants for many frightened
relatives of about 3,000 Americans held in the Middle East.
Officials call routinely, lend an ear, maybe crack a joke to ease
the tension.
   ``We are very sensitive to the needs of our people,'' said Ron
Kurz, a spokesman for ABB Lummus Crest Inc. of Stamford, Conn.
``Any request they have of us ... we would follow through and
respond as best we can.''
   Late Wednesday, it appeared the engineering company's efforts
might be paying off. Kurtz said he received word that four
employees, all Phillipines citizens, had been granted visas to
leave Iraq.
   ``It's a start,'' said Kurtz. ``And we're going to keep it up
until we get them (all) out.''
   But Michael Saba, founder of the Coming Home Committee to
support the families of hostages in Iraq and Kuwait, said such
support isn't universal.
   ``There are some companies that have cut people off the payroll
as of August 2 _ the day of the invasion,'' said Saba, who escaped
Baghdad shortly after Saddam Hussein's troops invaded Kuwait.
``It's despicable.''
   Saba said six or seven family members, including an elderly
woman who needed medical treatment, were negotiating Wednesday with
companies that had cut off pay and benefits to trapped employees.
The Champaign, Ill., businessman would not identify the companies.
   Saba and relatives said company officials may not be able to
sway events in the Middle East, but they certainly can ease fears
with gestures as simple as a phone call or as elaborate as
arranging for chartered planes or buses.
   Someone from Santa Fe International Corp. calls Sarrah Amos
every day. She said it's the kind of hand-holding that makes the
unknown more bearable.
   ``If they know something, they tell us,'' Mrs. Amos said
Wednesday from Gilmer, Texas. ``And if they don't ... they still
call to say, `Hey, how you guys doing?' ''
   For many bewildered relatives, it's nice to know they have the
resources and push of a powerful corporations behind them.
   ``We've always felt well taken care of,'' said Mrs. Amos, who
along with her husband fled war-torn Beirut with Santa Fe's help in
1975.
   This time troops captured her 56-year-old husband and many of
his oil company co-workers before they could reach the border and
bolt, as hundreds of foreigners have done since the standoff began
three weeks ago.
   Marjorie Walterscheid has also taken comfort in Santa Fe's
concern as the days become weeks without word from her 52-year-old
husband. He was among 35 U.S. citizens reported transferred from a
Baghdad hotel to an undisclosed location.
   ``They've been really good to me, calling every day,'' said the
Jacksboro, Texas, resident. ``It makes me feel like someone cares.''
   And that, company officials said, is the least they can do.
   ``At this point any communication is helpful,'' said spokesman
Scott Hallman of the aerospace company Lockheed Corp., which has
three employees missing. ``These people are dealing with constant
agony over what's going to happen to their loved ones.''
   Sherry Deaton hasn't heard from her husband since Aug. 17, when
he called from a hotel in Kuwait City. She said Lockheed's
sensitivity has helped bridge that silence.
   ``Their hands are tied ... but they keep me up to date,'' Mrs.
Deaton said from Marietta, Ga. ``They can't do much but it all
helps.''

   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange nosedived
Thursday for the second day in a row, losing nearly 1,500 points as
stock investors dumped issues because of concerns over the Middle
East crisis.
   The dollar was moving lower against the yen by midafternoon.
   The 225-share Nikkei ended the day at 23,737.63, losing 1,473.28
points, or 5.84 percent, the Nikkei's fourth largest single-day
drop. On Wednesday, it lost 1,086.93 points _ the index's
ninth-largest daily fall.
   The dollar was changing hands at 146.09 yen at 3 p.m. (0600
GMT). It opened lower at 145.95 yen and ranged between 145.80 yen
and 146.40 yen during afternoon trading.
   Higher oil prices triggered Thursday morning's Nikkei decline,
stock traders said. North Sea Brent crude oil for October delivery
was valued Thursday morning at $30.40 a barrel, up from Wednesday's
$30.20 to $30.30.
   Share prices were lower almost across the board in thin trading.
Yoshiro Inoue, an analyst with Nomura Securities Co., said the
Nikkei's decline was largely due to a fall Wednesday in the Dow
Jones average of 30 industrials in New York, as well as rising oil
prices.
   The average fell 43.81 points Wednesday. The price of the main
U.S. crude oil shot up $2.51 per 42-gallon barrel Wednesday on the
New York Mercantile Exchange to settle at $31.22.
   Investors in the Japan markets were taking a wait-and-see
position because of uncertainty about when the market will bottom
out, Inoue said.
   Share prices have fallen enough for many investors to consider
bargain hunting, Inoue said. ``Considering the amount the Nikkei
has lost, it should start rebounding any time soon. But the problem
is that the Middle East crisis is still there.''

<HEAD>SEC Charges Detroit Law Partners in Insider Trading Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal securities regulators say five
partners in a Detroit law firm avoided sizeable losses on the stock
of a foundering drug company through an alleged insider trading
scheme.
   Three of the lawyers charged in a civil lawsuit Wednesday
settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission _ without
admitting or denying wrongdoing.
   The SEC charged that one partner, Saul Bluestone, who was a
member of the board of Zenith Laboratories Inc., sold his stock in
May 1988 after learning the Ramsey, N.J., generic drug maker had
defaulted on a bank loan and was considering filing for bankruptcy
protection.
   Bluestone, 61, of Farmington Hills, Mich., was accused of
passing the information on to the other defendants, who also were
partners in the Detroit law firm now known as Lopatin Miller.
   Federal securities law forbids corporate officers and board
members from trading stocks in their company while possessing
inside information not known to the general investing public.
   The SEC complaint charged that two days before Zenith's problems
were made public, the other four partners sold their stock for
about $2 per share based on information from Bluestone that they
knew or should have known was confidential, and therefore illegal
to use.
   On May 4, 1988 Zenith announced it was seeking protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The
announcement dropped the price of Zenith stock to $1.12{ per share.
   Bluestone and two of the defendants settled the charges without
admitting or denying wrongdoing. They also agreed to pay fines and
restitution ranging from $9,234 to $84,334.
   The two were identified as Joseph Bartnick, 40, of Detroit, and
Norman Rosen, 44, of Farmington Hills.
   Bluestone and Bartnick also agreed to pay additional fines equal
to the losses saved by the persons they told directly about
Zenith's problems.
   ``My position is that I absolutely did nothing wrong,'' said
Bluestone when reached at the firm's offices. Bluestone said he
settled the SEC charges because ``it was easier to resolve it with
them than it was _ from the cost standpoint _ to fight it.''
   Two other members of the law firm, Albert Lopatin, 60, of
Detroit, and Sheldon Miller, 53, of Birmingham, Mich., did not
settle the charges. The SEC is seeking restitution of $11,563 from
Lopatin and $10,752 from Miller plus unspecified fines.

   The nation's Big Three automakers say they don't
expect any effects of the Mideast tension or the gasoline price
increase it has caused to show up today in new car and truck sales
numbers.
   Today's report for the Aug. 11-20 period is the first full
10-day sales report since Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2 and started a
gasoline price rise that has averaged about a penny-a-day per
gallon.
   Representatives of General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and
Chrysler Corp. said they didn't expect to see any immediate trend
away from large, gas-gulping cars to smaller, more fuel-efficient
vehicles.
   Closeout sales are underway to end the model year, complicating
any analysis of what may be going on in dealers' showrooms in
response to the Mideast crisis.
   ``We've had two exceptional weekends and it's been right in the
teeth of this (Mideast) thing,'' said Ralph Jackson, general sales
manager at Gwatney Chevrolet in Jacksonville, Ark. ``There still
appears to be in Arkansas people who are shopping for automobiles.''
   However, he added, ``If it does get worse, it could change
people's attitudes. The one thing that it probably would effect was
the full size vans. With the gas going up it's going to affect that
market a little bit more.''
   The new car and truck sales pace this year has been lagging
behind last year. Through July 31, GM, Ford and Chrysler had sold
about 6.1 million cars and trucks, down 6.7 percent from last year.
   During the fuel crises of the 1970s, when Americans were waiting
in long lines for a limited supply of gasoline, vehicles went fewer
miles on a gallon of gas than they do today.
   For example, the small Ford Pinto of the late 1970s got about
the same mileage as some of today's Lincoln luxury cars.
   Although prices are going up now, gasoline is going to have to
get a lot more expensive _ somewhere around $1.50 a gallon for
regular _ before sales are affected, said Joseph Phillippi of
Shearson Lehman Brothers in New York City.
   ``The gas thing is one issue but I think as (news reports) scare
people half to death over this issue, it's going to have an effect
on consumer confidence,'' Phillippi said.
   Chrysler spokesman Tom Houston agreed, saying gasoline prices
aren't having nearly as dramatic an effect on the industry as is
uncertainty.
   ``Through this point in time, we haven't seen anything,'' GM
spokesman Terry Sullivan said. He declined to speculate at what
point the automaker would begin seeing the effect of higher
gasoline prices on sales.
   Joel Pitcoff, a Ford spokesman, also said the company has seen
no indication so far of Mideast-linked events affecting vehicle
sales, with one notable exception.
   ``The one exception that we are definitely aware of is in
locations that are contiguous to military installations,'' he said.
``It has really been devastating to the dealers.''
   Pearson Ford is within 10 miles of the main gate of the 32nd
Street Naval Station in San Diego. New car sales manager Mike
Bridgeman said traffic in his showroom has fallen off dramatically
in the last few weeks.
   ``I would say its off at least 50 percent,'' he said.

   A new wave of selling drove stock prices into a
steep decline today as soaring oil prices and fears of war in the
Middle East kept the world's financial markets in turmoil.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials plunged 59.90 points to
2,500.25 in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers overwhelmed gainers by about 12 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 86 up, 1,029
down and 255 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 41.52 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said there was little question about where U.S. stock
prices were headed as Wall Streeters came to work this morning.
   The Dow Jones industrial average had fallen more than 96 points
in the last two sessions. Overnight, the Tokyo stock market
suffered a 5.8 percent loss, its fourth largest single-day drop on
record.
   The slide in U.S. stocks picked up momentum late Wednesday as
the price of oil surged past $30 a barrel to levels nearly double
where it stood at the beginning of the summer.
   The showdown in the Middle East that began with Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait on Aug. 2 has raised the specter of a wide range of
economic problems, including recession and a simultaneous surge in
inflationary pressures.
   A rapid rise in interest rates threatens to compound the
economy's woes.
   Brokers say stock-market investors have been dismayed to find
themselves trying to calculate the economic damage from the
situation in the Persian Gulf even as the crisis continues to
unfold.
   Losers among the blue chips included American Express, down 1{
at 22; Eastman Kodak, down 1{ at 37{; Philip Morris, down 1{ at
41{, and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down ~ at 31\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
4.04 to 170.18. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 4.81 at 319.58.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 43.81 points
to 2,560.15, extending its loss since July 17 to 439.60 points, or
14.65 percent.
   Declining issues swamped advances by more than 3 to 1 on the
NYSE, with 360 up, 1,202 down and 426 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 175.55 million shares, against 194.63
million in the previous session.

<HEAD>Trump Shuttle No Longer For Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Developer Donald Trump has taken the Trump
Shuttle off the auction block, a spokeswoman confirmed Thursday.
   The move came shortly after Trump's $65 million bank bailout was
officially completed. Part of the rescue plan requires Trump, whose
total debt is estimated to total $3.2 billion, to sell some assets.
   Trump's bankers had been pressing for the sale of the shuttle,
which had been losing money and draining cash flow at his empire.
   A Trump Organization spokeswoman noted that an upswing in
business at the shuttle and certain changes in operations have
helped make the carrier profitable.
   Shuttle spokespeople were not immediately available to comment
on how the recent spike in oil prices would affect the carrier.
   Trump acquired the shuttle from Eastern Airlines for $365
million in 1989. There has been considerable debate over the market
value of the carrier, which links Boston, Atlantic City, N.J., New
York and Washington. Trump accountants have valued the shuttle at
about $340 million, but others say the shuttle could fetch as
little as $150 million if sold as part of a liquidation.

   CBS News president David Burke confirmed today
he is leaving at the end of the month. In the network news
division's second high-level shakeup in two years, Eric Ober will
become the sixth chief executive since 1980.
   ``It is clear to me, following amicable discussions with the
management of CBS, that they would be more comfortable about the
future of the news division under new leadership,'' Burke said in a
statement.
   ``They have the right to make that decision, and I intend fully
to cooperate in the transition of leadership responsibilities.
   Burke, 54, a former ABC News executive vice president, had two
more years to go on his contract. He did not immediately return
calls to clarify whether he had resigned or was forced out.
   Ober is a 24-year CBS veteran and president of the CBS
Television Stations division. He previously worked at CBS News as
vice president for public affairs.
   A CBS source who spoke on condition of anonymity Wednesday night
quoted network executives as saying Burke had told them he was
leaving but gave no reason.
   Another source said Burke has had philosophical differences with
budget-conscious CBS Inc. President Laurence A. Tisch, with whom
Burke reportedly has clashed over the costs of news coverage.
   Pressure from Tisch to cut costs at CBS News led to the firing
of more than 200 staff members in 1987.
   However, one CBS executive, who asked not to be identified, said
today that Burke's departure ``is not a money issue. This is a
leadership issue.''
   Although there have been reports that CBS News was spending up
to $1 million weekly for its coverage of the Persian Gulf crisis,
``nobody within this company has talked with the news division
about what it's costing,'' the source said.
   ``It is right. It's our responsibility and we feel good about
it.''
   CBS News, after more than five years of internal turmoil,
recently had been scoring successes with its coverage of last
year's student uprisings in China and of this summer's crisis,
highlighted by Dan Rather's reports from Iraq.
   While the revamped ``CBS Morning News'' has remained third in
ratings, Rather's ``CBS Evening News'' has been a respectable
second to ABC's ``World News Tonight'' for several months.
   Burke, who from the start clamped down on leaks to the press
from CBS staff members, had generally stabilized the news division
after its cutbacks and turmoil that made him its fifth president in
five years.
   But like his predecessors, he still caused controversy, most
notably in February with his three-month suspension of ``60
Minutes'' humorist Andy Rooney after Rooney was quoted in a gay
magazine as making remarks derogatory to blacks.
   Rooney denied the remarks. Burke, who never specified why he
suspended Rooney, lifted the suspension in less than a month.
   Although ``60 Minutes'' remains high-rated and a solid
money-maker for the news division, Burke suffered a setback this
summer when ``Face to Face With Connie Chung'' was pulled off CBS'
scheduled fall lineup.
   The show's star said she wanted to try to have a baby. The news
division, whose ``48 Hours'' series is being moved from Thursday to
Saturday nights this fall, had counted on Chung's series to become
another money-maker.
   Burke succeeded Howard Stringer, now CBS Broadcast Group
president. Stringer became head of the news division in a 1986
shakeup when then-president Van Gordon Sauter was ousted. Sauter,
now a TV entertainment producer, had served two tours as CBS News
president, his last time after a man he appointed to the post _
Edward M. Joyce _ was shifted to a corporate slot in 1985.
   Burke, a former aide to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., came
into the news business late in his career when he was hired by ABC.
He joined CBS in August 1988.
   Burke's impending exit marks the second high-level change in
network news this summer. Earlier this month, former Los Angeles
Times publisher Tom Johnson succeeded Burt Reinhardt, 70, as
president of Ted Turner's Cable News Network.

   A dissident shareholder group moved closer to
forcing National Intergroup Inc. to sell all its assets.
   NII's board of directors said Wednesday it would offer for sale
the holding company's drug distribution business, FoxMeyer Corp.
   The company said in a statement that the board would ``entertain
and evaluate'' bids for FoxMeyer. It said ``recent indications of
interest have been received with respect to FoxMeyer.''
   ``Anything that comes across the transom will be looked at,''
said NII spokeswoman Judith A. Hale. She declined to identify the
interested parties, saying it was too early.
   The board decided to sell during its first meeting since the
dissident group, Centaur Partners of New York, won three board
seats July 25 in a proxy fight at the company's annual meeting.
   Following NII's announcement, Standard &amp; Poor's placed some of
the company's debt under review, underscoring NII's still-shaky
status. S&amp;P's assessments of the creditworthiness of corporations
and other borrowers are followed closely within the financial
community.
   Centaur, NII's largest shareholder with 16.5 percent of
outstanding shares, wants the company to distribute the proceeds
from its assets to shareholders.
   The company had agreed to place most of its businesses up for
sale but until now had insisted on keeping FoxMeyer, the nation's
third-largest wholesale drug distributor, as the foundation for a
continuing company.
   Also Wednesday, the board elected Buck Mickel as chairman. He
replaces Howard M. Love, who stepped down Aug. 9.
   Love's seat was one of the three claimed by Centaur. He will
serve as chief executive officer until his retirement in March 1991.
   Mickel is chairman of the board and chief executive officer of
RSI Corp., a distributor of outdoor equipment and office supplies.
   NII said Wednesday it reached an agreement settling several of
its differences with Centaur.
   Under the agreement, the company will pay Centaur $4.2 million
to cover part of the cost of the investors' proxy fight. Both
parties will withdraw pending lawsuits and will refrain for one
year from trying to amend NII bylaws on the structure of the board.
   Prior to beginning its restructuring, NII was a conglomerate
that owned 50 percent of National Steel Corp.; National Aluminum, a
major aluminum producer; the Ben Franklin Variety store chain and
Permian, an independent energy wholesaler.
   Ben Franklin is on the block, Permian will go on the block once
NII completes its tender offer for shares held by the public, and
the metals operations have been sold.

<HEAD>Plans Announced for Trading Futures and Options on Soviet Ruble</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL A. DRISCOLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Work is under way, in cooperation with Soviet
officials and economists, to develop ruble futures and options
markets at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   ``As the Soviets dismantle their past economic system of rigid
controls and move toward a market driven economy, it is imperative
that their monetary unit become an accepted world currency,'' said
Leo Melamed, executive committee chairman of the Merc, where
trading of foreign currency futures had its inception in 1972. He
made the announcement Wednesday.
   Melamed, considered a pioneer in currency futures, said he
expects the exchange will begin trading in the ruble late in 1991.
   ``The big question is how fast the Russians move to
convertibility,'' Melamed said. ``It hinges on that.''
   Western economists say the ruble cannot become truly convertible
to other currencies until the Soviet Union establishes a market
pricing system for all its goods and allows free cross-border
trade. They also say it is not possible to have a convertible
currency in a controlled market.
   Also, the currency doesn't circulate outside the Soviet Union.
Over the years, Soviet businesses wanting to trade with Western
companies have had to trade rubles with the Soviet government for
Western currencies. While this has loosened up somewhat under
Gorbachev, the rate of exchange is still set by Soviet officials.
   Earlier this month, the Soviet Council of Ministers, or Cabinet,
said it would let some businesses and organizations trade rubles
for foreign currency at market rates beginning at the first of the
year. The rate would be established by banks, currency auctions and
other operations.
   While the Merc's move into ruble futures could pay off if a
sizeable demand develops for the Soviet currency, the comparatively
low level of trade between the Soviet Union and most Western
countries raises questions on the need for a futures market,
Douglas Lamont, senior lecturer in international business at
Kellogg Graduate School of Business at Northwestern University,
said.
   ``The establishment of a ruble futures market is probably more
for public relations than it is for sound business reasons,'' he
said.
   But Lamont conceded that the Merc will be in a good position if
the Soviets move rapidly in making its economy more compatible with
other nations.

<HEAD>SEC, CFTC Bring Charges Against Stotler and Co.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A subsidiary of Stotler Group Inc., the
troubled futures concern once headed by the ex-chairman of the
Chicago Board of Trade, has settled administrative charges with
federal futures regulators.
   But similar charges brought by securities regulators remain
unresolved.
   On Tuesday, both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed separate administrative
actions against Stotler and Co.
   A goverment securities subsidiary of Stotler Group Inc., the
firm that Karsten ``Cash'' Mahlmann was in charge of until early
this month, Stotler and Co. was accused of violating both agencies'
minimum net capital requirements for months.
   In the CFTC action, Stotler and Co. which has closed down
because of a capital shortage, agreed to having its license revoked
and to cooperate with a CFTC investigation.
   Previously, the CFTC filed civil fraud charges against a related
company, Stotler Funds Inc., a commodity pool operator.
   Mahlmann resigned first as head of Stotler Group and then chief
of the CBOT _ the world's largest futures exchange _ on Aug. 1, one
day after the CFTC charged Stotler's commodity pool subsidiary with
misusing customer money.
   Mahlmann, 52, who says he hasn't been involved in the day-to-day
operations of Stotler Group since 1988, was not accused of
wrongdoing by either the SEC or the CFTC.
   No spokesmen for Mahlmann or Stotler Group could be reached for
comment Wednesday. A woman answering the telephone in the group's
Chicago offices said officials were in a meeting. They did not
return a reporter's calls.
   On Tuesday evening, the four-member SEC voted to start an
administrative proceeding against Stotler and Co. for alleged
violations of regulations concerning the sale of government
securities.
   The SEC accused Stotler and Co. of selling or trying to sell
government securities since November 1988 without being a member of
a registered securities association, such as the National
Association of Securities Dealers.
   The three-page order called for a public hearing before an
administrative law judge. Stotler and Co. faces penalties ranging
from censure to banishment from the industry _ if the judge finds
in favor of the SEC.
   The SEC also accused Stotler and Co. of failing:
   _ to maintain a minimum amount of cash and assets to offset
risks, the net capital requirement;
   _ to keep customers' funds in a reserve bank account;
   _ and maintaining proper records, including filing financial
reports with the SEC.
   The SEC also charged Stotler and Co. did not notify the agency
that its net capital had fallen below the required minimum.
   A commodities firm is required under federal rules to set aside
in a segregated account, cash equal to 4 percent of customers'
funds.
   The charges are administrative rather than civil or criminal and
would be decided by an administrative law judge, rather than a
judge in federal court. Penalties range from written censure,
limited operations, suspension for up to 12 months and banishment
from the securities industry.

   Grain and soybean futures prices opened higher
this morning at the Chicago Board of Trade.
   With the stock market falling and oil prices surging, analysts
said the grain markets are responding to continued fears of
inflation.
   They said tight worldwide grain stocks remain an underlying
support for the markets.
   The soybean complex has the added advantage of a government
report out this morning showing soybean oil and meal stocks well
below even lowest expectations of the market.
   In early trading, wheat was { cent to 2\ cents higher with the

were { cent to 1\ cents higher with September at $1.17\ a bushel;
and soybeans were 3{ cents to 4\ cents higher with September at

   Live cattle were .23 cent to 1.02 cents a pound lower with the
October contract at 77.20 a pound; feeder cattle were .50 cent to
1.20 cents lower with August at 89.02 a pound; live hogs were .50
cent to .82 cent lower with October at 47.75 cents a pound; and
frozen pork bellies were 1.98 cent to the limit 2 cents lower with

<HEAD>Insurance Firm Asking Workers To Retire</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: rewrites throughout to UPDATE and include attribution to

<DATELINE>WARWICK, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Metropolitan Property &amp; Casualty Insurance
Co. is asking workers to retire, but its general counsel says a
report that the company wants 80 percent of its work force to leave
was exaggerated.
   ``In no way would there be an 80 percent reduction in our work
force,'' vice president Richard W. Berstein said today, reacting to
a story in The Providence Journal-Bulletin that the company wanted
475 of its 670 workers to leave.
   Berstein said incentives were being offered to 475 workers, but
based on experience at other companies, Metropolitan expected no
more than 100 to take advantage of that.
   If any more than that decided to leave, ``we would have to
replace employees,'' he said.
   In a statement Wednesday, the company, an affiliate of
Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., blamed the move on a weak
insurance market. ``We just want to make sure that we keep our
expenses in line so that we have competitive rates,'' Berstein said.
   Clerical and salaried workers are being offered incentives of
from 12 top 65 weeks' pay, depending on seniority, to quit, said
Brendan Houlihan, senior director for human resources.
   If they do not accept by Sept. 19, ``they may face an
involuntary (layoff) program later in the year,'' Houlihan said.
   Company President Theodore J. Rupley said in a statement the
drastic move was the only way to keep the company healthy.
   Carol Young, the Journal's metro managing editor, said the paper
drew its conclusion from incomplete information.
   ``The company did not tell us yesterday what percentage it
expected to take'' the incentives, she said, ``and we drew the
conclusion that up to 80 percent could do it.''
   Besides those in Warwick, about 25 of the company's information
system workers in New York also will be affected, Houlihan said.
   Met Life workers in Rhode Island will not be affected, the
company said.

   Stock prices sustained another round of sharp

East kept the world's financial markets in turmoil.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials tumbled 54.46 points to
2,505.69 by noontime on Wall Street.
   Losers overwhelmed gainers by about 13 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 111 up,

   Analysts said there was little question about where U.S. stock

   The slide in U.S. stocks picked up momentum late Wednesday as
the price of oil surged past $30 a barrel to levels nearly double

<TEXT>
   American Airlines has ordered 100 passenger
planes worth $1 billion from an Italian-French aviation consortium,
one of the companies said Thursday.
   Aeritalia, the Italian aviation company, said the order from AMR
Corp., the parent of American, was the largest received so far for
the mid-range ATR series the Italian firm has developed with
Aerospatiale of France.
   The order consists of 41 ATR-42-s and 59 ATR-72-s. The planes
will be added to the fleet of American Eagle, an AMR subsidiary
which groups six regional airlines in the United States.
   The 42-seat and 72-seat planes will be delivered between March
1991 and 1996, Aeritalia said.
   The order brings the total number of ATR planes sold by the
Italo-French consortium to 537, between firm orders and options.
   Recently Aeritalia also got an order for five twin-engine
transport planes from the U.S. Air Force.

<HEAD>FBI, FAA Investigating Airplane Parts Distributor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An airplane parts distributor is being
investigated by the FBI and the Federal Aviation Administration for
possibly misrepresenting the condition and source of the parts it
sold to airlines, aircraft operators and other aviation vendors.
   An FAA spokesman said the agency also is checking to determine
whether K.C. Aerospace sold components that were unsafe or could
damage an airliner.
   Investigators are trying to ``identify any parts and components
which must be removed from airline inventories,'' said FAA
spokesman Bob Raynesford.
   FBI spokesman Max Geiman would not disclose what touched off the
investigation.
   K.C. Aerospace officials said they were cooperating with the
investigation and denied any misrepresentation or unsafe action.
   ``We don't think there is any ground for the investigation,''
said Richard Helfand, a lawyer for K.C. Aerospace.
   Helfand said that the company's FAA-certified parts repair shop
remains licensed and open, and that ``the FAA advised us that
everything's fine.'' He said the FAA had the option to close K.C.
Aerospace's repair shop without a hearing or warrant but had not
done so.
   The investigation was begun by the FBI, which then called in the
FAA, Geiman said. The inquiry has lasted several months, he said,
but no criminal charges have been filed against anyone, and no one
has been arrested.
   Last week the FBI served a search warrant at K.C. Aerospace's
offices, seizing boxes of files and records relating to the sale of
aircraft parts, according to federal court records. Affidavits
containing the reasons for the search were sealed at the request of
the U.S. attorney's office.
   Geiman said the FBI is checking into possible criminal
violations, while the FAA is looking at regulatory and safety
compliance.
   Raynesford said the FAA was alerting airlines and the aviation
industry that K.C. Aerospace may have misrepresented some of the
material supplied to its customers and that the buyers should
verify the condition and source of the material independently.

<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The regional airline subsidiary of AMR
Corp. will become the largest operator of ATR aircraft in the world
with its order this week for $1 billion worth of aircraft.
   The regional airline announced Wednesday that it bought 16 ATR
42 and nine Super ATR aircraft from ATR Marketing Inc., a joint
venture of the French aerospace company Aerospatiale and the
Italian Aeritalia.
   The commuter airline also has taken options on 25 more ATR 42s
and 50 additional Super ATRs, and agreed to lease eight ATR 42s and
three Super ATRs.
   AMR Eagle Inc. spokesman Ed Martelle said the order ranks among
the top two ever placed by a commuter airline.
   AMR Eagle operates the nation's largest commuter airline
network. Its parent, Fort Worth-based AMR Corp., also owns American
Airlines.
   The ATR 42 is a twin-engine turboprop that seats 46 passengers.
The Super ATR is a stretch version of the ATR 42 that seats 64.
   If all options for ATR aircraft are exercised, AMR Eagle will
have a total of 135 ATRs in service, officials said.
   ``The large AMR Eagle order, coming after years of experience
flying ATR 42 and Super ATR aircraft, is the highest possible
recommendation of the combined economic efficiency and passenger
appeal of the ATRs,'' said Henri-Paul Puel, president of ATR.
   Three weeks ago, the airline ordered 50 British Aerospace
Jetstream Super 31s in a deal worth an estimated $160 million.
   AMR Eagle placed an order last year for 150 Saab 34-seaters that
ranks with Wednesday's deal as the top two orders placed by
commercial airlines, Martelle said.
   American Eagle is made up of five AMR Eagle-owned carriers and
Metroflight, a franchise operator at Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport.
   The company operates 211 aircraft at the seven American Airlines
hubs at Dallas-Fort Worth; Chicago; San Juan, Puerto Rico;
Nashville, Tenn.; Raleigh-Durham, N.C.; San Jose, Calif., and
Miami. It also operates in New York and Los Angeles.

   Stock prices ended lower again Thursday, despite
rallying from sharp drops in early trading in tandem with a
technical rally on Wall Street.
   On the New York Stock Exchange, the Dow Jones industrial average
dropped 72 points in early trading, but recovered to stand down
53.72 points at the close of European dealings.
   Tokyo earlier had suffered a steep loss, with the Nikkei 225
share index falling 1,472.28 points, or 5.8 percent, to finish at
23,737.63.
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
fell 29.8 points, or 1.4 percent, at 2,075.0. That was up from the
day's low of 2,051.2.
   Volume on the day was 492.6 million shares, up from Wednesday's
338 million shares.
   Trading was thin as investors stayed away from taking positions
vulnerable to turns in the Middle East crisis, especially with
Britain nearing a three-day bank holiday weekend.
   The oil giants Shell and British Petroleum were both down. Shell
dropped 12 pence, or 23 cents, to 467 pence, or $9.11, and shares
in BP fell 5 pence, 10 cents, to 359 pence, $7.01.

<TEXT>
   Charles Keating Jr., the key figure in the
Lincoln Savings scandal, must prove he is broke and was ordered not
to send any money out of the country, a judge ruled.
   Keating also must give 48 hours notice before spending more than
$5,000, U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson said Wednesday.
   The federal Office of Thrift Supervision sought the action as
part of an effort to recover $40.9 million from Keating and five
associates in connection with three soured business deals at
Lincoln.
   ``It's an absolute victory for the American taxpayers,'' said
William Fulwider, OTS spokesman.
   The ruling would help recover taxpayer-insured money allegedly
misspent at the thrifts, and there would be more such efforts, he
predicted.
   The ruling was one of two court losses for Keating. In
Washington today, U.S. District Court Judge Stanley Sporkin
dismissing Keating's lawsuit to recover control of Lincoln Savings.
The judge said actions by Keating and his cohorts ``amounted to a
looting of Lincoln.''
   Both Lincoln Savings and Keating have become emblems of the S&amp;L
debacle. Regulators say Lincoln's failure may cost taxpayers $2
billion. Keating, whose personal style was lavish, steered Lincoln
into speculative real estate deals and junk bonds.
   Keating controlled Irvine-based Lincoln through his American
Continental Corp. in Phoenix. ACC's spokesman, Bradley Boland, said
Keating is broke, had never transferred money overseas, and is
being made a scapegoat for bungling government officials who
created the thrift crisis themselves.
   The case is part of a six-year attempt ``to take a piece of Mr.
Keating,'' Boland charged after Wilson's decision. ``The government
is not going to give Charlie any breaks. They're vicious, vicious
people here.''
   The OTS said Keating had failed to comply with its
administrative order and had asked the court to enforce it.
Negotiations between attoneys for the two sides had broken down,
forcing the case into Wilson's court.
   Keating's attorney, Jeffrey Powell, said Wilson's ruling would
be appealed. At Powell's request, another hearing was scheduled
Aug. 31, although Wilson said he did not see how his order would
change.
   If the ruling stands, Keating must give the OTS an audited
financial statement to prove his contention that he is broke and
has never transferred money out of the country.
   If he does not, he can be found in contempt.
   ``Given the amount of funds he was drawing out of Lincoln, it's
hard to imagine it's all gone,'' said Carolyn Lieberman, the senior
counsel for the OTS.
   ``It's also quite possible that given his travel to Switzerland
and the Bahamas during the last few years that he opened accounts
there,'' she said.

   The U.S. dollar fell broadly Thursday in trading
in Europe, sinking to a new lows against the German mark and the
Swiss franc and its lowest level in nearly nine years against the
British pound.
   Gold prices edged higher in active trading.
   Traders said the dollar was hurt by expectations that the U.S.
economy is growing more sluggish and that U.S. interest rates will
fall.
   The conflict in the Gulf over Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait
was seen as adding to the United States' economic woes, they said.
   The dollar finished at a new European closing low of 1.5478
German marks, down from 1.5535 marks late Wednesday. The dollar's
previous lowest close against the mark had been 1.5485 marks last
Friday in Europe. In later dealings in New York, the dollar was
quoted at midday at 1.5545 marks.
   Some West German dealers said they doubted the dollar will go
below 1.5400 marks after touching that level during trading on
Thursday. ``I think the dollar is finished for the time being at
1.54 after it tested that level several times during the afternoon
but didn't manage to break through,'' said Wolfgang Grebe, currency
dealer at Credit Lyonnais in Frankfurt.
   The dollar also reached a new closing low in Europe against t percent.

<HEAD>Zapata to Sell 90 Percent Stake in Drilling Rig Fleet For $280
Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zapata Corp. announced Thursday it has reached an
agreement to sell a 90 percent interest in its drilling rig fleet
to a European group for about $280 million.
   The Houston-based drilling rig company also said it has reached
an agreement in principle with its bank lenders to restructure
about $560 million of senior secured debt.
   A cash tender offer for the company's subordinated debt will be
the final step in Zapata's restructuring, the company said.
   ``I am very encouraged by the progress we have made, but we
still have a third, essential step _ bondholder acceptance of our
tender offer _ to complete,'' Zapata Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer R.C. Lassiter said in a statement.
   ``If the tender offer fails, it is likely that the company will
be forced to file for protection under the bankruptcy laws. In this
case, the value received by everyone involved would likely be
considerably less than the value that would be received through
voluntary restructuring,'' Lassiter said.
   The cash tender offer will be made within the next few months,
he said.
   Zapata spokesman Barney White said the fleet would be sold to a
group of European investors who were forming a new company
specifically for the purchase. He would not name the principals.
   Lassiter said negotiations of specific terms relating to the
sale were proceeding, and a final agreement was expected within
days.
   Zapata's 10 percent equity in the fleet and a continuing
management role ``will ensure that our current contract commitments
and our valued customer relations will not suffer any
interruptions,'' he said.
   Besides operating the rig fleet, Zapata produces oil and natural
gas and has commercial menhaden fishing operations that produce
fish meal and edible oil.
   Zapata also is the largest shareholder in Zapata Gulf Marine
Corp., the world's leading operator of marine service vessels.
   Under its restructuring deal, approximately $560 million in debt
would be reduced to $115 million with banks receiving at least $160
million in cash and 80 percent of the company's common stock,
including shares already owned by the banks.
   Zapata's senior lenders hold liens on all the company's assets,
so most of the proceeds from the rig sale will be used to repay
$53.6 million of rig debt and then restructure the company's senior
bank indebtedness, Lassiter said.
   ``Despite recent developments in the Middle East, the
fundamentals of the market for offshore drilling services remain
unchanged. In addition, the company's marine protein division is
experiencing another very disappointing year with its performance
well below our expectations,'' Lassiter said.
   ``It is time for Zapata to take decisive action to resolve its
debt situation,'' he said.

   The soybean futures complex fought off a surprise
revision of a government report on soybean oil stocks Thursday and
closed higher on the Chicago Board of Trade. The grains also
advanced.
   The Census Bureau reported early in the session that the stocks
of soyoil and meal are far below all trade expectations. The
futures market responded with a higher opening.
   But at midday, the data for soybean oil stocks was revised and
put at 1.420 billion pounds, well above the early figure of 1.203
billion pounds.
   ``The market tried to sell off at midday when the figures were
revised, but was met with very strong buying,'' said William
Biedermann, research director of Allendale Inc. in suburban Crystal
Lake.
   He said the selloff probably failed because the nation's grain
stocks are unusually tight. Further, grain traders appear to be
taking increasing note of the potential for war in the Mideast.
   At the close, wheat was } cent to 4 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $2.83 a bushel; corn was 3
cents to 5{ cents higher with September at $2.58{ a bushel; oats

   Stock prices plunged toward new 1990 lows today
as soaring oil prices and fears of war in the Middle East kept the
world's financial markets in turmoil.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials tumbled 55.69 points to
2,504.46 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers overwhelmed gainers by about 8 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 183 up, 1,524 down
and 279 unchanged.
   Analysts said there was little question about where U.S. stock
prices were headed as Wall Streeters came to work this morning.
   The Dow Jones industrial average had fallen more than 96 points
in the last two sessions. Overnight, the Tokyo stock market
suffered a 5.8 percent loss, its fourth largest single-day drop on
record.
   The slide in U.S. stocks picked up momentum late Wednesday as
the price of oil surged past $30 a barrel to levels nearly double
where it stood at the beginning of the summer.
   The showdown in the Middle East that began with Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait on Aug. 2 has raised the specter of a wide range of
economic problems, including recession and a simultaneous surge in
inflationary pressures.
   A rapid rise in interest rates threatens to compound the
economy's woes.
   Brokers say stock-market investors have been dismayed to find
themselves trying to calculate the economic damage from the
situation in the Persian Gulf even as the crisis continues to
unfold.
   Losers among the blue chips included General Electric, down 1\
at 59; Philip Morris, down 1{ at 41{; Boeing, down 1\ at 43}, and
International Business Machines, down 1 at 98.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
4.13 to 170.09. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 7.13 at 317.26.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 215.53 million shares with an

   News Corp. Ltd. said Wednesday that
losses from its Sky Television venture in Great Britain and the
effects of a domestic pilots' dispute reduced its earnings by 43
percent for the year ending June 30.
   The company, which also has newspaper, magazine and television
operations in the United States, reported it earned 282.28 million
Australian dollars, or $232.6 million, before abnormal items in the
latest year compared with 496.5 million Australian dollars a year
earlier.
   Revenue for the year rose 12 percent to 8.76 billion Australian
dollars, or $6.72 billion, from 7.81 billion Australian dollars a
year earlier.
   The U.S. division performed strongly, reporting its operating
income rose 36.6 percent to 799.29 million Australian dollars, or
$658.61 million.
   The group's United Kingdom operations suffered from reduced
advertising volumes and heavy competition with operating income
falling 66 percent to 131.89 million Australian dollars, or $108.68
million.
   In Australia and the Pacific Basin, operating income rose 2.9
percent to 425.44 million Australian dollars, or $372.81 million, a
year earlier.
   News Corp. said the slow-down in economic activity locally was
more severe than expected and adversely affected newspapers,
especially in display advertising.

<TEXT>
   Revco D.S., Inc., on Thursday announced
it will sell 146 retail stores in the Southwest to a Maryland
business as part of a divestiture plan the drugstore chain
announced in January.
   The 146 stores, in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and Colorado, are
being sold to RDS Acquisition Corp., formed by a group of veteran
retail drugstore executives, Revco said in a release.
   The sales agreement also calls for RDS to lease the Revco
distribution center in Glendale, Ariz.
   Terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
   Revco is operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Sale
of the stores is subject to approval by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
A Sept. 11 hearing date was set.
   The sale would complete Revco's 712-store divestiture program.
   Boake A. Sells, Revco chairman and chief executive officer, said
Revco recently closed on its previously announced sale of 223
stores to Jack Eckerd Corp. and the sale of Alabama stores and
inventory to Big B and Harco Drug.
   In addition, the bankruptcy court approved the sale of Revco's
Arkansas stores to Affiliated Food Stores on Aug. 14.
   In January, Revco reported it would focus its operations in
eastern states and reduce its store base to 1,100.

   The heavy demand for gas masks from
Middle Eastern distributors has forced a Barcelona firm to cut
short vacations and begin round-the-clock production, a company
owner said Thursday.
   Jeroni Llorca of Llorca Protective Systems said the company
planned to start producing its new Vispro civilian-use gas mask in
September. But frantic calls from distributors in Saudi Arabia,
Jordan, Syria and Israel convinced the firm to begin immediately.
   ``It's because of the psychosis that exists among the
population'' due to the threat of war in the Persian Gulf, Llorca
said.
   He said employees working on three eight-hour shifts were
producing 1,500 masks a day. He expected the first shipment to go
out Sept. 15.
   Llorca said French and Spanish distributors who work in the
Middle East also put in orders, although he would not provide any
names. The company's production target is 200,000 masks.

<TEXT>
   Mid-August vehicle sales by the nation's major
automakers fell 4.7 percent from the same period last year,
although General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. reported strong
truck sales Thursday.
   The figures indicated no dramatic effect on sales due to rising
gasoline prices spurred by tension in the Mideast. It was the first
full vehicle sales period since Iraq invaded oil-rich Kuwait on
Aug. 2.
   The Big Three automakers _ GM, Ford and Chrylser Corp. _ said
their cars and trucks sold at an average daily rate of 32,674
during the Aug. 11-20 period, compared with a daily rate of 34,290
during the same time last year.
   Car sales fell 10 percent while truck sales rose 5.1 percent
based on strong sales of GM and Ford vehicles. Trucks, as a class,
are less fuel efficient than cars, and a rise in the truck sales
figures indicates consumers did not shy away from gas gulpers in
favor of gas sippers.
   Sales of cars made by the Big Three tumbled 17.3 percent while
sales of North American-made cars bearing Japanese nameplates rose
45.1 percent.
   ``Transplants and trucks, they're the only real action,'' said
economist Tom Webb of the National Automobile Dealers Association
in McLean, Va.
   ``But considering all the negatives out there, stagnant growth,
declining employment, rising energy prices and international
tension, I expected much worse,'' he said.
   Ford spokesman Joel Pitcoff said the company recorded big jumps
in sales of all segments in the truck market, especially in
full-size pickups and the new Explorer sport-utility vehicle.
   Terry Sullivan of GM said most of the growth in his company's
truck sales is coming from minivans, particularly its new APV line
of minivans sold through Chevrolet, Pontiac and Oldsmobile dealers.
   ``This is a continuation of what's been happening all year
long,'' he said. ``It's our second-best truck year in history,''
behind 1988.
   Chrysler was the only one of the Big Three to report declines in
both car and truck sales during the 10-day period.
   During the mid-August period last year, automakers enhanced
their incentives in an effort to clear out unsold 1989 model cars
to make way for the 1990 models. At that time, there were about 65
selling days worth of new cars on U.S. dealer lots.
   This year, there are about 55 days worth of unsold cars at
dealerships, making the need for incentives less acute.
   For the entire year, Big Three car and truck sales were running
7 percent behind last year's pace, with car sales down 10.3 percent
and truck sales off 1.7 percent.
   Ford said a sharp 19.4 percent rise in its light truck sales
combined with an equally sharp 22.9 percent drop in car sales for a
7.8 percent decline in vehicle sales during the period.
   For the year, Ford's vehicle sales were running 8.1 percent
behind last year's pace, with car sales down 13.1 percent and truck
sales down 0.3 percent.
   GM said its mid-August vehicle sales were down 6.1 percent this
year as a 1.3 percent rise in truck sales was offset by a 10.1
percent decline in car sales.
   For the year, GM's car sales were down 6.1 percent and truck
sales were up 1.7 percent, combining for a 3.5 percent decline in
vehicle sales.
   For the mid-August period, Chrysler's car sales were running
27.3 percent behind last year's pace while sales of its trucks,
which include profitable minivans and Jeeps, were down 9.5 percent
for a combined 19.5 percent drop in vehicle sales.
   Through Aug. 20 of this year, Chrysler's vehicle sales were
running 14 percent behind last year's pace with car sales down 18.6
percent and truck sales off 9.5 percent.

   Oil prices surged to nearly $32 a barrel today and stock prices
tumbled in New York and Tokyo on profound worries about the
economic impact of the Persian Gulf conflict.
   On the New York Stock Exchange, the Dow Jones industrial average
tumbled 76.74 points to close at 2,483.41, its lowest close since
it stood at 2,462.44 on July 6, 1989.
   Trading volume was heavy at more than 250 million shares, while
the number of stocks posting lower prices outnumbered higher ones
by about 10 to 1.
   The price of the benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 71 cents to
$31.93 per 42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
the world's leading petroleum market.
   Bond prices also tumbled in New York, with the yield on the
30-year U.S. government bond reaching 9.11 percent in afternoon
trading, which if sustained would be the highest since May 1989.
   Conflict brewed today over U.S refusal to close its embassy in
Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. Iraq said defying the order to close
embassies by Friday would be an ``act of aggression'' while the
U.S. said reports that Iraq would surround the embassies would be a
mistake.
   ``God only knows what could happen,'' said Robert Brusca, chief
economist for Nikko Securities International Inc. ``At this point
nobody wants to take any risk.''
   In Tokyo, The Nikkei average of 225 stocks ended the day at
23,737.63, losing 1,473.28 points, or 5.84 percent _ the Nikkei's
fourth largest single-day drop. The index shed 1,086.93 points
Wednesday, the index's ninth largest daily fall.
   In London, the dollar fell to new lows against the German mark
and Swiss franc and to a nine-year low against the British pound.
   The dollar finished at 1.5478 marks, down from 1.5535 marks late
Wednesday. The dollar's previous lowest close against the mark had
been 1.5485 marks set last Friday in Europe. In later dealings in
New York, the dollar was quoted in afternoon trading at 1.5545
marks.
   In London, the dollar fell to its lowest level since December
1981 against the British pound. The pound rose to $1.9275 from
$1.9515, its lowest since trading at 1.9545 on Dec. 2, 1981.
   On London's Stock Exchange, share prices closed down despite a
late afternoon recovery. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index fell 29.8 points, or 1.4 percent, to 2,075.0, up
from the day's low of 2,051.2.
   The dollar closed at 145.88 yen today in Tokyo, down 1.04 yen
from Wednesday's close. Later, in London, it fell to 146.38 yen.
   On Wednesday, the price of the main U.S. crude oil shot up $2.51
per 42-gallon barrel to close at $31.22 on the New York Merc. Oil
last traded above $30 a on Nov. 26, 1985.
   The main thrust of Wednesday's selloff _ and in the overall
decline in stocks and bonds since Iraq seized Kuwait on Aug. 2 _ is
that higher oil prices will lead to more inflation in an already
shaky U.S. economy.
   Crude oil futures prices have risen nearly 40 percent since the
invasion, as the elimination of 4 million barrels daily of Iraqi
and Kuwaiti oil from world markets tightens world supplies.
   Even the prospects of jacked-up production by other nations are
waning. Analysts said the needs of foreign military forces in Saudi
Arabia could devour any increases by that nation, the world's
largest producer.

<HEAD>Money Funds Surge in Latest Week</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Interest rate figures reported by Donoghue's Money Fund
Report are for week ended Tuesday. All other figures are for the
week ended Wednesday.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Assets of the nation's 520 money market mutual
funds rose $6.22 billion to an all-time high of $408.0 billion in
the latest week, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   It was an unusually large weekly increase and broke the previous
record total of $401.78 billion set a week earlier. That figure
originally was reported as $404.48 billion but was revised downward
by the institute because the overall number of funds declined.
   The increase in fund assets in recent weeks reflects a rush by
investors to put their money into safe interest-bearing investments
because of the economic uncertainty created by the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   ``Massive asset inflows into money market funds continued
unabated as investors kept moving their money out of equities and
bonds,'' said Jacob Dreyer, the institute's vice president and
chief economist.
   The biggest weekly rise in the funds' assets _ $9.64 billion in
the week ended Oct. 21, 1987 _ came during the stock market
collapse as investors sought safe havens for their money.
   The institute said that in the latest week, assets of 253
general purpose funds rose $2.40 billion to $142.45 billion, assets
of 105 broker-dealer funds increased $2.67 billion to $166.07
billion, and assets of 162 institutional funds rose $1.15 billion
to $99.48 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.51 percent from 7.50 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 7.52 percent from 7.54 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
45 days, unchanged, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual
yield available on money market accounts was 6.08 percent as of
Wednesday, unchanged from a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, remained unchanged at 5.03 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.71
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 7.73 the
previous week. Yields were 7.86 percent on 1-year CDs, down from
7.88 percent; 7.93 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 7.94 percent;
and 8.04 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 8.05 percent.

<TEXT>
   Honeywell Inc. said Thursday that 120
employees will be cut from its defense and marine systems unit,
which employs about 8,300 people.
   The reduction, effective Sept. 6, results from reorganization in
preparation of a planned spin-off by Honeywell and efforts to
improve its competitive position in the defense industry, the
company said.
   Defense and marine systems, which will be called Alliant
Techsystems Inc. after the spinoff, said the reduction will affect
its management and technical employees throughout the Twin Cities
and Everett, Wash.
   Honeywell expects to obtain final board approval for the spinoff
in late third quarter 1990.
   Honeywell is a global controls company that provides products,
systems and services for homes and buildings, industry, and
aviation and space. The company had 1989 sales of $6.1 billion.

<HEAD>GM, Ford Offer Comprehensive Contract Proposals; Chrysler's Due
Friday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Auto Workers union on Thursday mulled
over the first comprehensive contract proposals from two of the
nation's Big Three automakers, and waited for a third on Friday.
   The union took the proposals from General Motors Corp. and Ford
Motor Co. under advisement and negotiators huddled privately to
dissect them.
   Their contents remain a mystery. GM issued a statement saying
only that a proposal for a new three-year national contract had
been given to the union. Ford and the UAW said there would be no
statements, and union members in locals around the country said
they knew nothing about the details of the proposals.
   The Chrysler Corp. proposal was due Friday. There has been
speculation that the struggling No. 3 automaker would try to break
from the practice of pattern bargaining, in which the UAW
identifies one of the three companies and negotiates a contract,
then brings it to the other automakers.
   But the union is expected to stick with pattern bargaining.
   ``It's a pattern agreement,'' UAW President Owen Bieber said
flatly after meeting with Chrysler negotiators.
   The union is expected to identify its target negotiating company
on Tuesday in Detroit, with speculation centering on GM.
   Bieber said the proposals from the Big Three would figure
heavily in the union's selection of a target company. Contracts
covering some 450,000 employees expire Sept. 14. Bargaining on new
national contracts began in mid-July.
   Chrysler's chief negotiator, Anthony St. John, has hinted that
the UAW should consider breaking the pattern with Chrysler. He has
said that simply rolling over the current agreement into a new
three-year pact would boost its costs by 16 percent, and that's too
much for the company to pay.
   Chrysler earned $180 million in the second quarter, down 47
percent from a year ago, and is expected to lose money in the third
quarter. Its cars and trucks were selling at a pace 14 percent
below last year's rate through Aug. 20.
   ``In my comments this morning, I indicated to the union
leadership that first and foremost Chrysler was unique in terms of
its cost-competitive situation among the Big Three,'' St. John said.
   ``They should have a considerable concern about the short and
intermediate prospects, given our sales activity and given our cost
structure,'' he said. ``I suggested to them that we had to
collectively come up with appropriate solutions to help ensure the
future viability of the company.''
   There has been speculation that Chrysler and the Italian
industrial giant Fiat Group are holding discussions which may
involve Fiat buying a stake in the U.S. automaker.
   Neither Fiat nor Chrysler have commented on details of the
discussions.

<HEAD>Dollar Reaches New Lows; Gold Mostly Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar continued its losing streak Thursday,
falling broadly to achieve new lows against the German mark and the
Swiss franc and reach its lowest level in nearly nine years against
the British pound.
   Gold prices were mostly higher.
   Once again the dollar succumbed to expectations that the already
sluggish U.S. economy will be further weakened by fallout from the
tensions in the Middle East.
   The dollar finished at a new European closing low of 1.5478
German marks, down from 1.5535 marks late Wednesday. The dollar
fell further in later New York trading, declining to 1.5445 marks
from 1.5575 late Wednesday.
   The dollar's previous lowest close against the mark had been
1.5485 marks, reached just last Friday in Europe.
   Some West German dealers said they doubted the dollar would go
below 1.5400 marks after touching that level during trading on
Thursday. ``I think the dollar is finished for the time being at
1.5400 after it tested that level several times during the
afternoon but didn't manage to break through,'' said Wolfgang
Grebe, currency dealer at Credit Lyonnais in Frankfurt.
   But U.S. analysts were pessimistic about the dollar reaching
bottom anytime soon.
   ``Corrective upticks (for the dollar) are very limited and
people are viewing even the smallest corrections as selling
opportunities,' said Pete Grant, a currency analyst with Money
Market Services in Chicago.
   ``We would look for further declines in the dollar,'' Grant said.
   Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait has sent oil and gasoline
prices sharply higher, and economists fear this will worsen the
United States' economic troubles. Traders believe the Federal
Reserve, faced with soaring inflation, is less likely to nudge U.S.
interest rates downward to stimulate the sluggish economy.
   Lower interest rates detract from the dollar's value because it
is unable to compete with currencies of countries with higher rates.
   Robert Hatcher, a corporate foreign exchange dealer with
Barclays Bank PLC in New York, said the dollar is likely to fall
further unless central banks including the Federal Reserve decide
the U.S. currency has fallen far enough. However, there are no
signs the banks are concerned about the dollar's drop.
   Despite its broad setback Thursday, the dollar did finish above
its lows for the day. Traders said a report that durable goods
orders rose 2.9 percent in July was three times larger than
expected, suggesting the economy may not be as weak as expected.
   The dollar reached a new closing low against the Swiss franc,
dropping in Europe to 1.2598 francs from 1.2735 late Wednesday, and
to 1.2560 francs in New York from 1.2775.
   The previous low close was 1.2685 Swiss francs, set Dec. 31,
1987 in New York.
   In London, the dollar fell to its lowest level since December
1981 against the British pound.
   The pound rose to $1.9515 in London from $1.9275 late Wednesday
and to $1.9570 in New York from $1.9235. That was sterling's
highest close against the dollar since it was quoted at $1.9545 on
Dec. 2, 1981.
   On June 23, 1981, the pound reached $2.0014.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 145.88 Japanese yen from
146.92 yen at Wednesday's close. Later, in London, the dollar was
quoted at 146.38 yen, and in New York, the dollar edged down to
146.12 yen from late Wednesday's 146.15.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's prices, included: 5.1855 French francs, down from
5.2390; 1,152.00 Italian lire, down from 1,162.25; and 1.12925
Canadian dollars, down from 1.13535.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Wednesday, included: 5.1835 French francs, down from 5.2260; 1.7390
Dutch guilders, down from 1.7500; 1,151.25 Italian lire, down from
1,159.00, and 1.1313 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1363.
   In New York, a troy ounce of gold picked up $1 to close at $412
on the Commodity Exchange. Republic National Bank later quoted a
bid of $411.25 a troy ounce, down $1.25 from Wednesday.
   In earlier London trading, gold rose to $412.75 a troy ounce
from $410.25 late Wednesday. In Zurich, gold rose to $411.75 an
ounce from $410.25 late Wednesday.
   In Hong Kong, gold rose $4.87 an ounce to $413.56.
   Silver slipped 0.3 cent to $5.126 a troy ounce on the Commodity
Exchange. In London, silver was unchanged at a late bid of $5.15 a
troy ounce.

<HEAD>Stocks Hurt Badly Again as Oil Prices Near $32 a Barrel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. stock prices fell to the lowest level in more than a year
and the cost of oil approached record highs Thursday as mounting
tensions in the 3-week-old Persian Gulf crisis shook world
financial markets.
   Trading activity in securities, oil and foreign currencies was
nervous and heavy around the world, driven by fears of war between
Iraq and an international force led by the United States.
   ``God only knows what could happen,'' said Robert Brusca, chief
economist for Nikko Securities International Inc. in New York. ``At
this point nobody wants to take any risk.''
   The Tokyo stock market registered its fourth-biggest drop ever
while a late-afternoon sell-off pushed the key Dow Jones industrial
stock index to its lowest level since July 1989.
   The Dow average of 30 big company stocks fell 76.73 points to
2,483.42. The index has dropped 17 percent since the market peaked
at an all-time high a hair below 3,000 on July 17.
   Hundreds of U.S. stocks hit 52-week lows and volume skyrocketed
to 250.44 million shares in heavy selling that erased $95.1 billion
in the value of corporate shares. Stocks have lost more since the
July peak _ about $550 billion worth _ than during the Black Monday
crash of October 1987.
   The price of crude oil, which has surged nearly 50 percent since
Iraq overran Kuwait on Aug. 2, gained another 71 cents to close at
$31.93 per 42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   The Merc is the leading market for futures contracts on
petroleum, which determine the price of oil over the next several
months.
   Crude oil contracts reached $32.35 in intraday trading, equaling
the highest level since futures contracts for oil were inaugurated
in 1983. The record was set on Aug. 2, 1983.
   After the 1979 Iranian revolution that ousted the Shah and
curtailed world oil supplies, crude reached a peak of $39.80 per
barrel in March 1980.
   ``This is by far the biggest thing that's ever happened to this
market since crude sold off from $40 a barrel,'' said Brian Tagler,
an oil futures broker for Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
   Growing nervousness gripped world markets Thursday. The main
fear is that war could disrupt oil supplies even further, worsening
inflation, weakening an already wobbly U.S. economy and prompting
an exodus from sensitive investments such as stocks.
   Slow growth prior to the Middle East crisis led to hopes the
government would lower interest to stimulate the economy, but
oil-driven inflation fears have erased that chance.
   ``Everyone figured we're going to war, recession is imminent,
interest rates aren't coming down _ and they don't want to own
stocks,'' said Dudley Eppel, a senior vice president at Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. ``Whenever there's uncertainty,
people sell stocks.''
   A showdown loomed Friday over an Iraqi order to empty all
Western embassies in occupied Kuwait, which Iraq seized after
accusing its neighbor of cheating on OPEC production levels and
depressing world oil prices. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was
shown on television with foreign captives.
   Also, reports of a bolstered foreign military presence in Saudi
Arabia, where the United States has massed its largest military
buildup since the Vietnam War, and war preparedness in Israel added
to market tensions.
   ``There's a significant risk that a significant amount of oil
may not be available if there is warfare,'' said Warren Shimmerlik,
an oil analyst with County NatWest USA in New York.
   On the bond market, a sensitive barometer of the economy's
direction, prices tumbled, with the yield on the 30-year U.S.
government bond reaching 9.13 percent in late afternoon trading,
its highest since April 13, 1989. The price of the bond fell nearly
$8 per $1,000 face amount.
   In Tokyo, the key Nikkei stock index closed at 23,737.63, losing
1,473.28 points, or 5.84 percent, the fourth largest single-day
drop. The index shed 1,086.93 points Wednesday.
   On London's Stock Exchange, share prices closed down 29.8
points, or 1.4 percent, to 2,075.0, recovering some ground when the
Dow Jones average briefly rose in New York.
   The dollar fell to a new low against the German mark and to a
nine-year low against the British pound on expectations the
sluggish U.S. economy will be further weakened by the Middle East
crisis.
   In Europe, the dollar fell to 1.5478 German marks from 1.5535
marks late Wednesday and in New York to 1.5445 marks from 1.5575.
Its previous lowest close had been 1.5485 marks, last Friday in
Europe.
   The British pound rose to $1.9515 in London from $1.9275 late
Wednesday and to $1.9570 in New York from $1.9235. That was
sterling's highest close against the dollar since it was quoted at
$1.9545 on Dec. 2, 1981.

<HEAD>Cattle Futures Plunge the Limit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL A. DRISCOLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cattle futures prices plunged the daily limit on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange Thursday, as concern grew about the
implications of the Mideast crisis.
   Pork futures also suffered setback, particularly bellies, which
were down the limit for the third consecutive day.
   On other markets, oil futures posted new strong gains, gold
moved ahead slightly and grains and soybeans advanced.
   Beef is more expensive than pork at the meat counter now, making
cattle much more vulnerable to outside price swings, said Phil
Stanley, a trader at the Merc and consultant to ADM Investor
Services.
   ``Economic worries had as much to do with the break in cattle
prices as anything,'' he said.
   Inflation or recession would turn shoppers away from high-priced
beef cuts.
   Pork futures have been under pressure from the skidding cash hog
market, and Thursday was no exception.
   ``It's been kind of a free fall for cash hogs,'' said Stanley,
noting that they've lost nearly $3.50 per hundredweight this week.
A large increase in the number of animals being brought to
slaughter has severely weakened the cash market.
   Pork prices were at record high levels earlier this summer, but
have been in a fairly steady decline. Meanwhile, cattle have
remained fairly level for half a year.
   While the relatively high price of beef makes cattle more
vulnerable, pork is not immune, Stanley noted.
   ``If the stock market falls on its face,'' he said, ``we can
expect another deep plunge for cattle and hogs.''
   Live cattle settled .75 cent to the limit 1.50 cents lower with
the contract for delivery in October at 76.72 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .57 cent to the limit 1.50 cents lower with August at
88.95 cents a pound; live hogs were .30 cent lower to .20 cent
higher with October at 48.42 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies
were 1.58 cent to the limit 2 cents lower with August at 43.72
cents a pound.
   The soybean complex resisted a selloff at the Chicago Board of
Trade after a surprise revision of a government report that made
important changes in the level of the nation's soybean oil stocks.
Grain and bean complex prices ended with substantial gains.
   The Census Bureau reported early in the session that the stocks
of soyoil and meal are far below all trade expectations. The
futures market responded with a higher opening.
   But at midday, the data for soybean oil stocks was revised and
put at 1.420 billion pounds, well above the early figure of 1.203
billion pounds.
   ``The market tried to sell off at midday when the figures were
revised, but was met with very strong buying,'' said William
Biedermann, research director of Allendale Inc. in suburban Crystal
Lake.
   He said the selloff probably failed because the nation's grain
stocks are unusually tight. Further, grain traders appear to be
taking increasing note of the potential for war in the Mideast.
   Wheat settled } cent to 4{ cents higher with the September
contract at $2.83 a bushel; corn was 3\ cents to 5\ cents higher
with September at $2.59 a bushel; oats were 2\ cents to 3 cents
higher with September at $1.19\ a bushel; and soybeans were 11}
cents to 13{ cents higher with September at $6.28 a bushel.
   Gold futures prices posted only modest gains at the Commodity
Exchange in New York, despite soaring oil prices.
   The December contract has repeatedly touched the $425 level, but
has lacked the punch to break through.
   ``Every time it reaches that price it runs into extremely good
selling,'' said David Syphen, manager of metal futures for Merrill
Lynch Capital Markets Inc. in New York. ``It shows a fundamental
weakness in the market, with very, very willing sellers at those
levels.
   He said that if the oil market turns around, ``there's going to
be quite a long slide for gold.''
   Gold settled $1 to $1.40 higher with the December contract at
$420.30 a troy ounce; silver was .5 cent lower to .1 cent higher
with September at $5.135 a troy ounce.
   There was no letup of the Mideast crisis at the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   Light sweet crude oil settled 71 cents to $1.50 higher with the
October contract at $31.93 a barrel; heating oil was 3.57 cents to
6 cents higher with September at 96.23 cents a gallon; and unleaded
gasoline was 3.92 cents to 4.44 cents higher with September at
$1.0855 a gallon.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended Aug. 13, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,299.8 billion from $3,292.1 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,085.6 billion from $4,083.1 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $814.4 billion from $812.9 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 over the past 52 weeks is 5.4
percent, within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.

<HEAD>Attorney General Seeks to Open Secret Bass-Times Stock Settlement</HEAD>

   Florida Attorney General Bob
Butterworth on Thursday sought to open a secret stock settlement
between Times Publishing Co. and a Texas billionaire, saying it may
harm the non-profit Poynter Institute.
   Butterworth, in a letter to institute President Robert J.
Haiman, said he would take the issue to court unless the institute
immediately provides details of the settlement, which were not made
public as part of the agreement.
   ``We need numbers. We can't go with these broad statements that
everything is great,'' the attorney general said in an interview.
   Last week, a group led by Texas investor Robert Bass agreed to
drop a federal lawsuit seeking a better return on its investment in
Times Publishing in return for redemption of 3,000 shares of
preferred stock the group owned.
   The Poynter Institute, which runs a variety of journalism
programs, uses the stock dividends from Times Publishing to support
its operations. Times Publishing runs the St. Petersburg Times,
Congressional Quarterly, Florida Trend and Georgia Trend magazines.
   It is the stock redemption that Butterworth is challenging. The
attorney general was asked in March by the Poynter Institute to
intervene in the Bass case, partly out of concern that redeeming
the stock would jeopardize the non-profit journalism school's
financial viability.
   ``The sparse summary of that settlement provided this office
(and the public) includes a statement that all preferred stock
will, in fact, now be redeemed or retired,'' Butterworth said in
the letter.
   Butterworth said that unless trustees agree to provide him with
more information about how the settlement was structured and who
made the decisions, he could only conclude that the arrangement
will harm the Poynter Institute.
   Without more information, he said, he would try to open the
settlement in court.
   ``There is no way I can get out of this lawsuit based on what
we've been told, which isn't enough,'' he said. ``I was asked to
join the lawsuit to protect the Poynter Institute, and we're going
to do that.''
   Times Editor Andrew Barnes, who also serves as Poynter Institute
chairman and chief executive officer of Times Publishing, said the
settlement was ``careful to assure the Poynter Institute would be
enhanced, not harmed, by any agreement.''
   ``We are comfortable, as were the Poynter Institute trustees,
that the settlement is fair and assures significant ongoing
financial support for the institute,'' he said.
   George Rahdert, the attorney handling the case for the Poynter
Institute, said he would reply to Butterworth soon and hoped to
meet the attorney general's request.
   ``We have limited flexibility as to what we can do,'' he said.
``We want to answer the attorney general's questions.''
   The secret settlement arose from the Bass group's attempt to buy
the Times for $270 million earlier this year. The group owned 40
percent of the voting stock in Times Publishing but under an
unusual arrangement got only 5.7 percent of the dividends.
   The partnership, known as Poynter-Jamison Ventures Ltd.,
challenged the stock system in U.S. District Court. The settlement
last week resulted in dismissal of that suit, but Butterworth said
he could continue it to obtain assurances of the Poynter
Institute's financial health.
   ``We are not going to bat for the St. Pete Times or any of the
magazines,'' Butterworth said. ``The only entity we're going to bat
for is the Poynter Institute.''

<HEAD>Flight Tests Show New Wing Design Could Cut Costs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tests show that airlines could save hundreds
of millions of dollars in fuel costs with a new wing design that
reduces drag from air flowing over a passenger jetliner's wings,
NASA said Thursday.
   A joint government-industry flight test program produced results
that were much better than expected, said officials of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   The tests were conducted for five months on a Boeing 757 on
which a 22-foot wing section had been replaced by a wing surface
designed to produce a smooth air flow, the space agency said. If
the modification had been made along the entire wingspan on both
sides, drag would have been reduced by 10 percent, the space agency
said.
   Each percent of drag eliminated by the U.S. transport fleet
would result in an annual fuel savings of $100 million for the
industry, NASA said.
   The modified wing section includes millions of tiny,
laser-drilled holes in a titanium skin covered by a flap along the
leading edge to shield against insects and dirt during takeoffs and
landings.
   The holes create a suction effect that diverts turbulent air
from the surface of the wing and allows a smoother air flow.
   The design resulted from earlier flow tests on military jets,
NASA said. A future flight test is being considered that will use
the system on other wing sections.
   The testing is jointly funded by the government and Boeing
Commercial Airplane Group, which builds Boeing jetliners.

<HEAD>Marketing Deal Cancelled After Challenge by Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and Rhone-Poulenc
Rorer Inc., facing an antitrust challenge to a joint marketing
plan, said Thursday they cancelled the agreement to avoid a legal
dispute.
   The plan to cooperate in the over-the-counter drug market would
have given P&amp;G, which makes the Pepto-Bismol stomach remedy,
exclusive rights to sell Rorer's Maalox antacid.
   The Justice Department announced a lawsuit Aug. 7 challenging
the arrangement on grounds it would reduce competition and raise
prices in the stomach remedy market.
   Randy Thurman, group president of RPR pharmaceuticals, said the
companies were confident the arrangement would survive U.S.
Department of Justice legal challenges.
   However, ``we weighed the risks of an extended court process to
RPR's consumer business, our employees and our customers and, on
balance, chose to terminate the agreement,'' Thurman said in a
statement from Rhone-Poulenc's headquarters in Fort Washington, Pa.
   Thurman said failing to close the agreement with P&amp;G could
reduce pre-tax earnings $30 million because of lost revenue from
inventory transfers.
   ``We are convinced that this alliance would have enhanced the
level of competition in the U.S. and been of value to consumers,''
P&amp;G and Rhone-Poulenc said in a joint statement.
   The agreement, announced March 13, had not taken effect, pending
government review.
   According to the Justice Department, the $236 million in
combined sales by P&amp;G and Rhone-Poulenc in the over-the-counter
stomach remedy market make up 26 percent of the $900 million market.
   P&amp;G reported worldwide sales of $24 billion for the year ending
June 30. Rhone-Poulenc reported sales of $3 billion.

   Heavy selling sent stock prices tumbling to
their lowest levels in more than a year Thursday as runaway oil
prices and fears of war in the Middle East kept the world's
financial markets in turmoil.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials plunged 76.73 points to
2,483.42, its lowest close since it stood at 2,462.44 on July 6,
1989.
   Since July 17 the average has fallen 516.33 points, or 17.2
percent.
   Declining issues overwhelmed advances by about 11 to 1 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 148 up, 1,645 down and 242 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board reached 250.44 million
shares, up from 175.55 million in the previous session.
   Analysts said there was little question about where U.S. stock
prices were headed as Wall Streeters came to work Thursday morning.
   The Dow Jones industrial average had fallen more than 96 points
in the last two sessions. Overnight, the Tokyo stock market
suffered a 5.8 percent loss, its fourth largest single-day drop on
record.
   The slide in U.S. stocks picked up momentum late Wednesday as
the price of oil surged past $30 a barrel to levels nearly double
where it stood at the beginning of the summer.
   The showdown in the Middle East that began with Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait on Aug. 2 has raised the specter of a wide range of
economic problems, including recession and a simultaneous surge in
inflationary pressures.
   A rapid rise in interest rates threatens to compound the
economy's woes.
   Brokers say stock-market investors have been dismayed to find
themselves trying to calculate the economic damage from the
situation in the Persian Gulf even as the crisis continues to
unfold.
   Losers among the blue chips included General Electric, down 1}
at 58{; Philip Morris, down 1| at 41&rsqb;; Boeing, down 2{ at 42{, and
International Business Machines, down 2&lsqb; at 96~.
   Energy stocks, which had been a notable bright spot of late on
the strength of higher oil prices, also got caught in the downdraft.
   Federal National Mortgage lost &lsqb; to 26|. The stock traded as low
as 24~ before the company announced that it would devote as much as
$500 million to buybacks of its common shares and warrants.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 298.29 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $95.09 billion, or 3.16
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 5.34 to 168.88.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 11.41 to 362.23, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 9.49 at 307.06.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped 14.61 to 360.22. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 315.85, down 8.54.

   Seven OPEC nations will meet informally
Sunday to discuss the Persian Gulf crisis that has tightened world
oil supplies and sent crude prices soaring, Venezuela's president
said Thursday.
   Oil ministers from a majority of the 13 nations making up the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to attend the
talks in Vienna, the cartel's headquarters, Venezuelan President
Carlos Andres Perez said in Caracas.
   Perez did not list the nations. He said the meeting would not
require a decision on whether to increase production to make up for
an international embargo of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude because of
Iraq's invasion of its neighbor.
   Boosting production to account for the decline, which amounts to
about 4 million barrels of crude oil daily, has received
insufficient support among OPEC members.
   But in Venezuela's view, the meeting could turn into an
``emergency session'' in which decisions could be made, Venezuelan
Energy and Mines Minister Celestino Armas said.
   An OPEC source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said OPEC
President Sadek Boussena, the Algerian oil minister, will be in the
Austrian capital Sunday, and ``he will consult with anybody who
cares to come.''
   Fears of military escalation in the Mideast and shortages of oil
on Thursday sent futures prices for light, sweet crude up 71 cents
to $31.93 a barrel.
   On Wednesday, crude exceeded $30 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, breaking a threshold that had not been touched
since November 1985.
   In addition to Boussena, ministers from Indonesia, Nigeria and
Iran were expected to show up for the OPEC get-together.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Oil Minister
Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying his trip ``is a positive response to
(Boussena's) call for an exchange of views on the current situation
in the world oil market.''
   One source said Saudi Arabia also was likely to attend, but
there was no official confirmation of the report.
   Boussena made a surprise visit Thursday to Jiddah, Saudi Arabia,
for talks with Hisham Nazer, the kingdom's oil minister, who was
rebuffed earlier in the week in an attempt to call an emergency
session of all 13 nations.
   Nazer, along with Venezuela's Armas, had requested the meeting
to discuss the turbulent situation. But OPEC headquarters issued a
statement Monday saying there was not enough support among the
others to hold a formal meeting.
   It was unclear whether either Saudi Arabia or Venezuela would
attend anything short of a conference of all the members. They were
reportedly backed in their call for an urgent meeting by Qatar, the
United Arab Emirates and Ecuador.
   Indonesian Oil Minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita was quoted by a
local newspaper in Jakarta as saying neither Iraq nor Kuwait would
attend the weekend talks.
   Saudi Arabia and Venezuela would like OPEC's approval to boost
oil production to help meet the shortfall.
   Nazer said last weekend Saudi Arabia, which produces about a
quarter of the cartel's oil, would lift pumping to 2 million
barrels a day, with or without the nod from OPEC.
   Without a formal meeting, the oil ministers could not authorize
some countries to overshoot the supply quotas set last month for
each member.
   Analysts expect Saudi Arabia, which produces about a quarter of
OPEC's oil, to follow up on its pledge to increase production. Its
cartel quota is 5.4 million barrels a day.
   In Caracas, the newspaper El National quoted industry sources as
saying the oil company Petroleos de Venezuela has received orders
to boost crude output soon by at least 300,000 barrels a day.
   Analysts expect the South American nation to add as much as a
half million barrels a day to its OPEC quota of 1.9 million barrels.
   They say the United Arab Emirates, likely producing about 1.7
million barrels a day, could reach up to 2 million barrels.
   Nigeria and Libya could each add about 100,000 to 200,000
barrels a day to their quotas. Nigeria has a cap of 1.6 million
barrels, and Libya, 1.2 million barrels.
   OPEC agreed at its midyear meeting last month in Geneva to limit
output to 22.5 million barrels a day in the final six months of the
year to try to kick crude prices up to $21 a barrel.
   With the gulf crisis, the average price of a basket of crudes
monitored by the group reached $25.29 a barrel last week.
   The next formal meeting of the organization is not scheduled
until December.

   Toymaker Hasbro Inc. on Thursday
promoted Dan Owen, a sales executive with Playskool, to president
of the subsidary, two days after Stephen A. Schwartz resigned from
the post.
   Owen, who joined Hasbro in 1974 as a sales representative and
rose to senior vice president, will answer to Alfred J. Verrecchia,
chief operating officer for the company's domestic toy operations.
   Under Schwartz, Playskool was Hasbro's fastest-growing division
during the past two years, taking on the powerful Fisher-Price unit
of Quaker Oats Co. Playskool, whose products include Mr. Potato
Head and Tinkertoys, generated about $352 million in domestic sales
last year, or about 25 percent of Hasbro's $1.4 billion in
worldwide net sales.
   David S. Leibowitz, an investment banker and senior vice
president with American Securities Corp. in New York, said Hasbro
made the right move in promoting Owen.
   ``Dan is very well equipped to assume the reins at Playskool,''
said Leibowitz. ``He is the right man in the right place for the
job.''
   Schwartz resigned Tuesday. He said he planned to form a
consulting firm on toys and related products.
   Under a management shakeup, he would have reported to
Verrecchia. He had been reporting directly to Alan G. Hassenfeld,
Hasbro chairman and chief executive.
   Schwartz said the parting was amicable, but the shakeup ``wasn't
necessarily right for me.''
   Hassenfeld and Owen could not be reached for comment Thursday.
   Recently Hasbro's sales have lagged, and Verrecchia may have
been appointed to oversee domestic toy operations because he has
more of a financial background, analysts suggested.
   In other moves, Pawtucket-based Hasbro appointed Norman Walker,
head of European operations, president of the newly created
International Division, which combines the European division with
Hasbro's operations in South America and the Pacific Rim.
   E. David Wilson, senior sales vice president of Milton Bradley,
was appointed president of the games division.

   SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals will make
a generic form of its popular high blood pressure drug, Dyazide, to
be distributed by Rugby Laboratories, the companies announced
Thursday.
   SmithKline Beecham will continue providing Dyazide under its
brand-name for those who want it. Rugby will ship the generic
capsules to pharmacies, chains and wholesalers by Oct. 1.
   Frederick W. Kyle, president of SmithKline Beecham
Pharmaceuticals-U.S., said Rugby has the largest generic
distribution network in the country. Rugby Chief Executive Officer
Michael Ashkin called the deal ``an excellent fit.''
   The capsules contain 25 milligrams of hydrochlorothiazide and 50
milligrams of triamterene, the active ingredients.
   Generic competitors for Dyazide, one of the most widely
prescribed drugs in the country, have been absent from the
marketplace since Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. earlier this year
withdrew its version. It appeared false documents had been used to
support Bolar's claims for the product.
   Last summer, Vitarine Pharmaceuticals Inc. withdrew its generic
from the market after admitting it substituted samples of the
brand-name drug for its product in potency tests.
