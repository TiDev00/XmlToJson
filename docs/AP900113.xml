<HEAD>Court Weighs in Against 350-Pound Man</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The scales of justice tipped against a
350-pound man who had claimed he was fired from his fast-food
restaurant job for being too fat.
   A U.S. District judge on Thursday rejected Ted S. Mounts' claim
of discrimination by Long John Silver's Inc. and his request for
$205,000 in damages.
   Mounts, 37, said his obesity was a medical problem and therefore
a physical handicap. Federal and state laws prohibit employment
discrimination on the basis of race, sex, nationality, religion and
physical handicaps.
   But Judge Charles Haden said it ``would require some quantum
leaps'' of logic to accept the discrimination argument. Attorneys
for the restaurant, where Mounts worked for 12 years, said he was
fired in 1987 for incompetence, not size.
   Mounts claimed that company officials ``harassed, embarrassed
and humiliated'' him because of his weight. He was never
reprimanded for his job performance, but every written evaluation
he received from 1980 to 1986 mentioned his size, he said.
   ``It was always an unwritten rule there that being big was
bad,'' Mounts said. ``They say I don't look professional being
overweight.''
   Mounts said he is unemployed and receives Social Security and
state workers' compensation benefits.
   ``I'm not really happy about the decision, but maybe it will
encourage others in my situation to stand up and not be afraid of
the big guy,'' Mounts said.

<HEAD>Soviet Dissident Celebrates Crumbling of Communism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT DVORCHAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP National Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The crumbling of communism is sweet vindication
for Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky, who was whisked through the
Berlin Wall in a 1986 prisoner exchange after languishing for nine
years in the gulags.
   ``The events of the last year were the realization of our
wildest dreams. There is such a hole in this iron wall that nobody
can ever rebuild it again,'' Sharansky said. ``There is no question
communist ideology has failed, and some of the most fascinating
changes are happening in our lifetime.''
   Sharansky, 41, personifies the struggle of Soviet Jews for human
rights and freer emigration. He begins his first U.S. lecture tour
with a speech Tuesday at the University of California at Davis.
   In an hour-long interview here, Sharansky said dissidents should
get credit for forcing President Mikhail Gorbachev to restructure
the Soviet system. He also said anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union
is getting stronger as communism's grip weakens, and is fueling an
exodus of Jews to Israel.
   For Sharansky, the breakdown of the old order in the Soviet bloc
was the most exciting moment since his release from prison after
serving nine years of a 13-year sentence for spying, a charge that
he denied.
   ``We dissidents had such deep beliefs in our hearts that sooner
or later this system had to become bankrupt, morally, socially,
economically and politically. Nobody could expect it to go so
quickly,'' he said.
   ``I told my wife that that by the time our youngest daughter
grew one tooth, two more dictators in Eastern Europe had fallen
down,'' said Sharansky, who lives in Israel with his wife and two
daughters.
   Sharansky was at first denied permission to leave the Soviet
Union, although his wife, Avital, was allowed to leave a day after
they were married in 1974. She worked tirelessly for his freedom,
meeting with President Reagan to plead his case. Reagan and
Gorbachev arranged for his release at a summit meeting, and
Sharansky passed to freedom across Glienicke Bridge to West Berlin
on a frozen Feb. 11, 1986.
   Sharansky recounted the horrors of Soviet prisons in his 1988
book ``Fear No Evil,'' published by Random House. He plans about 10
lectures a year to talk about who is responsible for Soviet
restructuring.
   ``The Soviet dissidents and their supporters in the West are the
midwives of glasnost and perestroika,'' Sharansky said, cautioning
against the lionization of Gorbachev as a champion of democracy.
   ``Gorbachev is a loyal communist. His aim was to save the
communist system by changing it. He deserves credit for one thing:
he was the first Soviet leader to say that communism would lose to
capitalism if urgent changes weren't made in the economy.''
   Sharansky also said: ``There are dissidents still in Soviet
prisons who were jailed for saying the same things as Gorbachev.''
   Sharansky was a comrade of Soviet dissident and Nobel
Prize-winning physicist Andrei Sakharov, but was denied permission
to visit the Soviet Union for Sakharov's funeral in December.
   Sharansky, who has a street marker in New York named after him,
dropped his Soviet name, Anatoly, to use his Hebrew name, Natan,
when he entered Israel.
   As chairman of the Soviet Jewry Zionist Forum, he helps Soviet
Jews find housing and jobs.
   ``We are seeing the biggest exodus of Jews in modern history.
They are afraid to stay in the Soviet Union because of
anti-Semitism. It's absolutely inevitable this exodus will
continue,'' Sharansky said. ``There is practically no place for
Jews in the Soviet Union in the future.''

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses Kidnapping Charges Against Parents Who
Deprogrammed Daughter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID SEDENO</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A judge on Friday threw out all charges
against a couple accused of kidnapping their adult daughter in a
failed deprogramming attempt, saying a jury never would be able to
reach any kind of verdict.
   Superior Court Judge David Moon Jr.'s ruling came a day after he
declared a mistrial because a jury had been deadlocked on kidnap,
false imprisonment and battery charges against Earle and Dorothy
Brown, both 58, of Santa Cruz.
   The Browns and three co-defendants were charged with abducting
Ginger Brown from a northern San Diego County parking lot in May
1988 and holding her for five days in an attempt to deprogram her.
   Ginger Brown, then 22, had joined a small religious group called
Great Among Nations, which her parents say is a cult whose leader,
Benjamin Altschul, brainwashes his followers.
   Also charged in the case were the Browns' other daughter, Holly
Brown, 25, of San Francisco; Los Angeles deprogrammer Cliff
Daniels, 35; and his accomplice, Hank Erler, 23, of Escondido.
   A jury on Wednesday had returned seven acquittals against the
defendants but deadlocked on remaining charges.
   The judge said that any further court proceedings would not be
worth the time and expense. He said the jury was unwilling to
convict the defendants even though some of them incriminated
themselves during testimony.
   ``This judge is not going to let the people's courtroom be used
to titillate the public's fascination with unusual religious
groups,'' he said.
   Earle Brown said he was delighted by the rulings and said he now
wanted his daughter back.
   ``We've since forgiven her. If there is animosity toward us on
her part we might apologize, but I don't know what we might
apologize for to the group. We will still continue to pray for
her,'' he said.
   Ginger Brown, who remains a part of the religious group, said
she was not disappointed with the ruling and planned to drop a $2.5
million civil suit against her parents and the other defendants.
   ``I didn't lose anything other than the strong binding I had
with my family that (deprogrammer) Cliff Daniels has been
successful in wedging apart,'' she said.
   ``I hope they come to me and apologize, come to all the members
of my church and apologize and especially to my pastor and
apologize for this slanderous way in which they have portrayed our
ministry,'' she said.
   Altschul has described his group as a television ministry that
hopes to produce and sell programs to television stations worldwide.

<HEAD>Government to Allow Public Role in Planning Weapons Changes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department, under pressure from
environmental critics, will give the public a chance to review how
its plans to clean up and rebuild the nation's nuclear weapons
complex will affect the environment.
   The announcement Friday by Energy Secretary James D. Watkins
came nearly seven months after 22 environmental and arms control
groups sued the department to force such a review.
   ``The significance of it is that it would be the first
comprehensive and public analysis of the whole weapons program,''
said Dan Reicher, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, one of the environmental groups that sued.
   Reicher said allowing the public to participate in the planning
could lead to significant changes in the future emphasis of the
multi-billion dollar weapons program.
   ``It could very well shift the direction of the program away
from modernization and toward cleanup,'' he said.
   Watkins also won applause from Capitol Hill.
   ``The department's decision today may mean that the bomb
factories' iron curtain of secrecy is lifting,'' said Rep. Les
AuCoin, D-Ore., one of several members of Congress who 13 months
ago requested the environmental reviews.
   Many environmental groups, including Reicher's, have argued the
government should spend more to clean up the trail of hazardous and
radioactive wastes generated by weapons plants. Many of the 17
major plants and laboratories in 12 states were built in the late
1940s or early 1950s and operated for decades in a dome of secrecy
that permitted environmental abuses.
   Watkins also announced Friday he was sending independent teams
of environmental specialists to five weapons plants or laboratories
to study their compliance with federal and state environmental laws
as well as health and safety rules.
   The five plants are the Savannah River Site near Aiken, S.C.,
which makes materials for nuclear warheads; the Pinellas weapons
components plant near Largo, Fla.; the Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory at Livermore, Calif., which performs research and
testing of weapons designs; the Brookhaven nuclear research
laboratory at Upton, N.Y.; and the Sandia nuclear weapons
laboratory at Livermore.
   Watkins has been trying to reassure the public his department is
committed to developing a long-range plan for cleaning up nuclear
wastes, but he also wants to spend billions of dollars rebuilding
key parts of the weapons complex.
   In his announcement, Watkins said the department would prepare
an environmental impact statement on its recently published
five-year plan for cleaning up the weapons plants. He said the
report will evaluate alternative approaches to resolving the waste
problem, including treatment, storage and disposal options.
   He said an environmental impact statement on long-term plans for
modernizing the weapons production system also is planned, although
the department has not released details of a modernization plan.
Catherine Kaliniak, a department spokeswoman, said an internal
assessment of modernization priorities will be completed in a few
months.
   Watkins said public hearings would be held as part of the
environmental studies, and the results would be used as a
``planning tool to guide decision making.''
   ``Preparation of these major environmental documents, with
opportunities for full public participation in the process, will
assure environmentally informed decision making,'' he said.

<HEAD>U.S. Computer Makers Drop Joint Plan to Manufacture Chips</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. computer companies are dropping plans for a
cooperative venture to challenge Japanese leadership in the making
of computer memory chips, according to published reports.
   The proposed venture, U.S. Memories, failed to attract enough
investors, according to reports in Saturday's editions of The New
York Times and The Washington Post citing sources in the computer
industry.
   The plan called for building a $1 billion factory to make
computer memory chips, using money donated by at least seven
computer and semiconductor companies.
   Sanford L. Kane, the president of U.S. Memories, told the Times
that he was frustrated by his failure to persuade computer
companies to sign up for the venture.
   ``One can only bang their head against the wall for so long.
Sooner or later you get a headache,'' he told the Times. He refused
to comment directly on the reports that the cooperative venture was
dead.
   U.S. Memories was announced in June as a project to restore
American strength in production of the common computer memory chips
known as dynamic random access memory chips, or DRAMs. By November,
however, several major computer companies _ including Sun
Microsystems Inc., Unisys Corp., Apple Computer Inc. and Tandy
Corp. _ had said they would not join as investors.
   Japanese firms supply a majority of the memory chips now
available. Most American chip manufacturers dropped out of the
market several years ago.
   Computer industry officials told the Times that the end of U.S.
Memories was decided Wednesday at a meeting in Dallas attended by
the seven firms that had signed up and other firms still
considering entering the venture.
   The Times said the project failed in part because the memory
chips have become more widely available as Samsung of South Korea,
Siemens A.G. of West Germany and Motorola Inc. of the United States
have begun manufacturing the chips.

   Subway gunman Bernhard Goetz, wearing blue jeans
and an open white shirt, defended himself in court against a $50
million lawsuit filed by one of the four youths he shot on a train
five years ago.
   ``It could have been better, it could have been worse,'' Goetz,
42, said after his legal debut Friday in a 30-minute session before
state Supreme Court Judge Barry Salman.
   Attorney William Kunstler, who is representing shooting victim
Darrell Cabey in the civil lawsuit, said ``time will tell'' if
Goetz can become a competent counselor.
   The judge ordered Kunstler to have a lawyer examine Cabey to
determine whether the plaintiff is competent to be questioned by
Goetz. Cabey, now 24, was paralyzed from the waist down in the Dec.
22, 1984, shooting.
   Goetz, a self-employed electrical calibrator, has filed a $40
million libel action against Cabey, his mother, and attorneys
Ronald Kuby and Kunstler. Again acting as his own attorney, Goetz
said the two lawyers libeled him when they described him as a
``walking time bomb and a racist.''
   Goetz served 8{ months in jail on a weapons conviction stemming
from the subway shooting after a legal battle that reached the U.S.
Supreme Court.

   An offer of a cigarette and a job from
Paterson Mayor Frank X. Graves may have saved a man from jumping
from a sixth-floor ledge.
   Saying he wanted to shake hands to clinch the job offer, Graves
clutched Robert Hamway's right hand and held on for dear life. Two
firefighters lunged forward, grabbed the 24-year-old man's arms and
pulled him to safety.
   After the incident Thursday, Graves said he was trying ``to open
a door'' of opportunity for Hamway.
   He said the job offer was legitimate, but carries no guarantees
if Hamway fails to perform.
   Authorities said Hamway told them while on the ledge that he had
an outstanding arrest warrant and had recently missed an
appointment at a cocaine detoxification center.

   Christian Slater, a 20-year-old
actor who appeared in ``Heathers'' and ``The Wizard,'' has been
charged with drunkenly crashing his car, trying to flee and kicking
a deputy.
   The actor, a Van Nuys resident, is free on $3,000 bail. He is to
be arraigned Jan. 19 in Beverly Hills Municipal Court on charges of
drunken driving, battery on a police officer, resisting arrest and
evading arrest.
   Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies spotted Slater's Saab
Turbo 900 traveling more than 50 mph in a 35 mph zone on Santa
Monica Boulevard in West Hollywood at about 1 a.m. on Dec. 29,
authorities said.
   They said they tried to pull it over, but the car turned onto
side streets and smashed into two telephone poles.
   Slater jumped out, ran, and was climbing a chain-link fence when
Deputy Vincent Moultrie dragged him down, getting Slater's cowboy
boots in his face in the process, said Deputy District Attorney
Hugh Bobys.
   Tests showed the actor's blood was .16 percent alcohol, far over
the legal limit of .08, Bobys said.
   Slater also starred in a skateboard movie, ``Gleaming the
Cube,'' and had roles in ``Tucker: The Man and His Dream,'' ``The

<HEAD>Tax Agency Announces Tougher Ethics Rules</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service is toughening
rules of conduct for senior employees following highly publicized
allegations of misconduct by some field managers.
   The aim, said IRS Commissioner Fred Goldberg, is to protect
``what is the bedrock of our tax system, and that is the real and
perceived integrity of this institution.''
   ``What we need is ongoing attention and adherence to the kinds
of issues of conduct, ethics and appearance that are essential to
tax administration,'' Goldberg said Friday in announcing the ethics
initiative.
   Goldberg acted after congressional hearings last summer in which
managers and other top officials of some field offices were accused
of abusing power, favoring friends and operating almost
independently of directives from the agency's Washington
headquarters.
   ``This is an agency of 120,000 employees and we will rise or
fall on the kinds of procedures ... the kinds of controls we have
in place that minimize to the absolute extent possible incidents
that create either the appearance or reality of illegality,
misjudgment or misconduct,'' Goldberg said.
   The initiative was hailed by Rep. Douglas Barnard, D-Ga.,
chairman of the House Government Operations consumer subcommittee,
which conducted a two-year investigation of the allegations and
held public hearings last year.
   ``If that plan is properly implemented, it will go a long way
toward solving some extremely serious employee misconduct and
morale problems at the service,'' Barnard said.
   ``In order for our self-assessment tax system to work properly,
the public must be confident that senior IRS employees are
respectful of taxpayer rights and educated to exercising their
responsibilities fairly as well as effectively,'' Barnard said.
   In announcing the plan, Goldberg disclosed the IRS has suspended
at least temporarily a ``lockbox'' setup, roundly criticized during
Barnard's hearings, that some have interpreted as an amnesty
program for tax cheats.
   The IRS ``will be trying to clarify what if anything we want to
do with'' the lockbox procedure, Goldberg said. He denied that the
procedure is necessarily an amnesty but acknowledged it could be
interpreted as such.
   The procedure was authorized by Ronald Saranow, then head of the
IRS criminal investigation division in Los Angeles. Delinquent
taxpayers represented by a lawyer friend of Saranow could, while
keeping their identities secret, make cash payments to a lockbox
and receive an IRS letter saying they would not be the subject of a
criminal investigation unless their evasion arose from illegal
activities.
   In discussing the ethics initiative, Goldberg refused to answer
questions about the most widely publicized allegation at the
Barnard hearings: a charge that an IRS executive launched an
investigation of the manufacturers of Jordache jeans because of his
relationship with the competing makers of Guess? jeans.
   In that probe, the IRS raided Jordache's New York offices and
seized one million documents. The company has not been charged.
   The new ethics program announced by Goldberg includes:
   _An agreement under which the Treasury Department inspector
general will investigate allegations against senior IRS managers
and all employees of the IRS inspection division. Employees in that
division operate as the internal affairs branch of IRS.
   _An ``inspection hotline'' to give IRS field employees a direct
line to Washington headquarters when they don't feel comfortable
complaining to local officials.
   _Reversal of an earlier decision under which local office
managers can approve their own travel vouchers.
   _Removing any ambiguity from regulations on investments by IRS
employees.
   _Ensuring that every training program for IRS employees includes
emphasis on ethics and conduct.

<HEAD>President Says Panama Invasion Shows U.S. Needs Strong Military</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, described as ``pretty broken
up'' by a meeting with the family of a soldier slain in Panama, is
using the invasion to argue that the United States must keep a high
state of military readiness.
   ``This is not a time when we should naively cut the muscle out
of our defense posture,'' Bush said Friday in a speech aimed at
Congress, which reconvenes Jan. 23 after its winter recess.
   Bush cautioned that despite a relaxation of military tensions in
Eastern Europe, lawmakers should not expect a ``peace dividend'' in
which defense savings could be funnelled into domestic programs.
   ``Unfortunately, what is being packaged as a `dividend' is not
money in the bank. It is more like a possible future inheritance,''
Bush said in his speech to the Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce.
   ``Whenever a potential inheritance looms, there are those eager
to rush out and squander it _ to buy new things, to spend, spend,
spend _ spending funds they don't yet have,'' he said.
   Bush went to Camp David after the Ohio trip and planned to spend
a three-day weekend at the presidential retreat in Maryland.
   He told the business audience the Dec. 20 U.S. intervention in
Panama was a ``beautifully coordinated'' operation. If a rationale
for keeping a strong defense is ``ever needed, we saw it last month
in the courage of our troops in Panama,'' he said.
   But later, Bush was brought close to tears in a meeting with the
Cincinnati parents of a Army Pfc. James Markwell, a Ranger medic
killed in the invasion, aides said.
   Markwell, who had been in the Army 18 months, died of gunfire
after his arrival by parachute in a ``drop zone'' on the day of the
U.S. invasion.
   Bush met after the speech with Mr. and Mrs. William Rouse,
Markwell's mother and stepfather.
   Markwell's brother, Brandon, 17, and his sister Dawn, 15, were
also present, said Bush's press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater.
   It was a ``pretty emotional meeting,'' said Fitzwater, who was
present at the session, along with deputy chief of staff Andrew
Card Jr. and several Secret Service agents.
   He said Bush was touched when Mrs. Rouse produced a poem her son
wrote at age 15 about his desire to be a solider. ``It was very
sad,'' Fitzwater said.
   Then the mother produced a ``death letter'' her son wrote before
entering combat. Each Ranger writes such a letter and it is
delivered only if the soldier is killed, Fitzwater said.
   In the letter ``he talked about how he was proud of what he was
doing,'' Fitzwater said. It also contained ``a little message for
each of the people he knew in life,'' the aide said.
   ``All of us were pretty broken up at that point,'' Fitzwater
said.
   Bush has written personal letters to the families of all 23 U.S.
soldiers killed in the invasion, but it was his first face-to-face
meeting with one of the families, Fitzwater said.
   Bush visited U.S. servicemen wounded in the invasion on New
Year's Eve in two military hospitals in San Antonio, Texas. He
mentioned that visit in his Chamber of Commerce speech, saying ``I
will never, ever forget their spirit.''
   ``The Panamanian operation was conducted by highly trained
troops _ the best trained troops in the world. But it is not simply
training, it is patriotism and dedication,'' he said.
   Bush said he welcomed the ``dynamic changes in Eastern Europe''
and strongly supported Soviet Leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's efforts
at political reform.
   The president also told his audience of about 1,500 people that
key parts of his domestic agenda _ including a cut in the capital
gains tax, stronger clean air standards and education and
anti-crime programs _ were ``bogged down in the jungles of Capitol
Hill.''
   ``The clock is running and America's patience is running out,''
he said.
   At Cincinnati's predominantly black Taft High School, Bush also
hailed a program of business leaders, government officials and
educators to reduce dropouts and improve academic performance.
   And, borrowing a line from 1988 Democratic presidential
contender Jesse Jackson, Bush told the students: ``I don't think
you can design a curriculum to lift the self-esteem of a kid. It's
got to come from peers, from family, from dedicated volunteers -who
are saying `you are somebody.'''

<HEAD>Ballet Dancers' Threat To Step Out On Picket Line</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's best ballet dancers are threatening to
strike over pay and working conditions, raising the prospect of a
picket line outside the venerable Royal Opera House in Covent
Garden.
   The dispute had dragged on since July and now threatens the
cancellation of three ballets. It also has disrupted the first
joint production of the Royal Opera and Royal Ballet, the Russian
opera ``Prince Igor,'' which has a 25-minute ballet.
   Richard Wright, the Royal Opera administrator, said Friday that
after two days' talks with Equity, the performers' labor union, a
revised offer would be made Monday to the 136 dancers of the Royal
Ballet and the Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet. Both share the Royal
Opera House with the Royal Opera.
   The opera house at first offered a 10 percent pay increase to
the dancers' demand for 15 percent. The house gradually raised its
offer to 15 percent, but only in return for more hours of work and
agreement to allow two productions a year to be shown on a screen
to non-paying crowds in the Covent Garden piazza.
   The dancers are likely to go on saying no.
   The dispute broke Friday into front-page caricature.
   Cartoonist Matt of the conservative Daily Telegraph, playing on
a pay dispute at Ford of Britain auto plants, showed one Ford
assembly-line worker saying to another: `I hope we don't go on
strike. I don't want people thinking I'm a ballet dancer.''
   The dancers want salaries that would close the gap with the
higher pay of the choristers and musicians at the Royal Opera House.
   The 15 percent offer would take the pay of senior principal
dancers from $860 a week to $988. Pay for first-year members of the
corps de ballet would go up from $278 to $322 for a 33-hour week.
   The dance dispute is really a rebellion at the 132-year-old
state-supported opera house, where ballet dancers feel they have
always been treated as poor cousins. Opera is definitely king at
Covent Garden.
   Jeremy Isaacs, the opera house director, struggling with a $5
million deficit this year, has pleaded for a quick settlement.
   Rebecca Holmes, 21, a Royal Ballet dancer of first-artist rank,
making $410 a week, told a reporter her day usually runs from 7
a.m. to midnight, with subway travel and having to use rehearsal
rooms nearly six miles away from Covent Garden.
   She said Sunday is her one day off, when all she does is sleep
and eat.
   The dancers say their work is tough and demanding, with grueling
rehearsals followed by evening performances. Their dancing careers
will end in their mid-30s.
   Friday also was a bad day for the Royal Ballet on another front.
   Anthony Dowell, the director, said it had been forced to abandon
talks with New York's Metropolitan Opera Association for a
long-planned tour to the United States in July because it could not
find sponsors.
   ``I am very disappointed that the tour will not take place,''
Dowell said. ``We were eagerly looking forward to a return visit to
the Metropolitan Opera and to our American public.''

   Even New York police are having trouble
believing this one: the trouser zipper that stopped a bullet.
   Angel Santana, 51, was reportedly shot with a .357-caliber
Magnum pistol Friday during a struggle with one of three men
holding up the store where he worked.
   The robbers were so shocked to see the bullet lodged in
Santana's zipper that they fled, and dropped their gun, said
Officer Fred Weiner, a police spokesman.
   ``Maybe they thought they were outnumbered by the zipper,''
Weiner said, adding that while the story was ``kind of hard to
believe'' it was doublechecked by officers. The gun and the spent
bullet were found in the store, he said.
   Santana was treated for trauma at Lincoln Hospital.

<HEAD>Environmentalists Complain About Great Lakes Cleanup</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People and wildlife in the Great Lakes region
are exposed to a growing health threat because the U.S. and
Canadian governments move too slowly in carrying out an
anti-pollution plan, environmentalists contend.
   In a letter to Secretary of State James Baker III and EPA
Administrator William Reilly, a coalition of 10 environmental
groups said failure to carry out the Great Lakes Water Quality
Agreement also is undermining U.S. credibility in international
environmental negotiations.
   Without action soon, ``women in the Great Lakes basin may never
be able to safely eat a fish dinner or nurse their children without
fear of deadly PCB poisoning,'' Melanie Griffin, a Sierra Club
official, said at a news conference Friday.
   ``It's as though the folks over there in the EPA building don't
even know that we have this treaty with Canada,'' said Mark Van
Putten, director of the National Wildlife Federation's Great Lakes
Natural Resources Center.
   An EPA official said the Bush administration shares the
environmentalists' goals but added that implementing the agreement
will take time.
   ``Because the problem is so big and complex and there are so
many players involved, things do not move with the speed of
light,'' said Frank Covington, deputy administrator in the agency's
Chicago office, headquarters of the EPA's Great Lakes program.
   Covington said EPA has focused its attention on provisions added
to the agreement in 1987, when the emphasis shifted to 40 ``hot
spots'' where toxic pollution is especially severe. The agency has
been helping states develop plans for cleaning those areas, he said.
   Signed in 1972, renewed in 1978 and updated two years ago, the
bilateral accord pledges the U.S. and Canadian governments to
cooperate with each other in ridding the Great Lakes of toxic
substances.
   Central to the pact is a pledge that toxic discharges into the
waters be ``virtually eliminated.''
   There have been improvements since 1972, including cutbacks in
the discharge of pollutants directly into the lakes, Ms. Griffin
said. But little has been done about toxins such as contaminated
rainwater and runoff from farms, city streets, hazardous waste
dumps and contaminated sediments, she said.
   Numerous scientific studies have concluded the lake pollution is
entering the food chain, posing a health threat, the
environmentalists' letter said.
   Researchers believe the atmosphere is the source of 25 percent
of all toxins in the lakes, Ms. Griffin said. Yet the EPA has
regulated only seven of hundreds of toxic air pollutants, she
complained.
   Pesticides and phosphorus flow into the lakes from farm runoff
and urban runoff contains heavy metals such as copper and lead,
said Diane Cameron, an environmental engineer with the Natural
Resources Defense Council.
   The agreement calls for programs to collect and treat runoff,
which neither country has done adequately, Ms. Cameron said. They
also are failing to protect wetlands and continue to allow
developers to construct buildings too close to lake shores,
worsening the runoff problem, she said.
   Van Putten said state and local governments in the Great Lakes
region have added top the problem by engaging in a ``conspiracy of
silence'' on covering up violations of regulations.
   ``Michigan is unwilling to publicly criticize Wisconsin because
Wisconsin might later criticize Michigan, and EPA ... has been
unwilling to step in and force the states to make the progress
required under the agreement,'' he said.

   Federal authorities used a Stinger to lure four
suspected Irish Republican Army guerrillas into a sting operation
in which they offered $50,000 for the missile that can shoot an
airliner out of the sky.
   The four men were arrested Friday after going to a warehouse in
the West Palm Beach area to buy the heat-seeking missile from
agents posing as arms dealers who told the suspects the weaponry
was stolen from the U.S. military, said William Gavin, who heads
the FBI in south Florida.
   ``They made it very clear they were interested in procuring
Stinger missiles and high explosives _ and they intended to ship
them out of the country,'' Gavin said at a news conference.
   Kevin Joseph McKinley, 33, Seamus Moley, 30, and Joseph
McColgan, 39, all Irish nationals, and Sean John McCann, 34, of
Canada, are believed to be members of the Provisional IRA, or
``Provos,'' the guerrilla arm of the nationalist group fighting to
end British rule in Northern Ireland.
   Each suspect was charged with conspiracy to possess destructive
arms, possession of a destructive device and violations of the Arms
Export Control Act and the Neutrality Law. Each faces up to 25
years in prison and $750,000 in fines if convicted, the FBI said.
   The suspects denied the charges as they were led in handcuffs
from the federal courthouse to the Palm Beach County Jail, where
they were being held without bond pending a hearing Tuesday.
   ``I'm just a poor Irishman here on holiday, and I was entrapped
by certain people here,'' McColgan said in a thick Irish accent.
   ``They were going to sell equipment for the Irish Republican
struggle,'' McColgan added with a smile. ``They wanted to sell us
missiles. Imagine that.''
   Their capture concluded a two-month joint undercover
investigation by the FBI, the U.S. Customs Service and the federal
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
   The investigation began after the FBI received intelligence that
the men, who had been staying in a Riviera Beach trailer park, were
looking to buy weapons, agents said.
   In a series of meetings, the suspects told the agents about
terrorist activities to persuade them that they were serious about
buying the Stinger, officials said.
   ``When they met with our undercover agents, they described in
detail events which occurred outside of the country _ which did
occur _ and we believed absolutely they were involved,'' said
Special Agent Robert Creighton, regional ATF supervisor. He
provided no details about the events discussed by the men.
   The suspected guerrillas went to the undisclosed warehouse
Friday to inspect the Stinger, which was on loan from the U.S.
military, and allegedly paid $50,000 for its purchase, Creighton
said.
   ``If this was fired at an airliner it could blow it right out of
the sky,'' said Timothy Wagner, head of the U.S. Customs Service in
Florida.
   The Stinger uses an infrared homing device to target the heat
generated by the engine of an attacking plane or helicopter. It has
proved highly effective against low-flying aircraft. Stingers that
the United States provided to the Afghan rebels reportedly caused
heavy losses to Soviet warplanes and helicopters.
   Fired from a tube held on the shoulder, the Stinger vaguely
resembles the World War II bazooka. It has a range of about three
miles, is about 5 feet long, weighs 34.5 pounds and carries a
fragmentation warhead.
   In a previous operation against IRA arms procurements in the
United States, authorities arrested three IRA ``technical experts''
in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Pennyslvania on July 12 and
seized radar and missile parts.
   A federal grand jury in Boston indicted five people in the case
on charges of violating federal arms export regulations.

   A group of prominent scientists, including
five Nobel Prize winners, wants the ``super collider'' built as
originally envisioned even though the cost of the giant particle
accelerator could rise by more than $1 billion.
   The Energy Department's High Energy Physics Advisory Panel
agreed Friday with a subcommittee's findings that significantly
reducing the size or power of the collider to contain costs would
``unacceptably increase the risk of missing important new physics.''
   The panel said it was told that keeping the Texas project as
originally envisioned, however, could increase the $5.9 billion
pricetag by 20 percent to 30 percent.
   As designed, the super collider will smash beams of protons into
each other in a 53-mile circular tunnel at 20 times the energy
possible with the most powerful existing accelerators.
   It would take a reduction of beam energy of 25 percent to hold
costs to the original figure, the advisory panel's report said.
   But it said the project's mission to learn more about ``such
issues as the origin of mass,'' the best efforts of theoretical
physicists indicate the original energy ``is about the minimum
energy needed to have confidence that these phenomena, in whatever
form they may take, will be seen.''
   A 25 percent reduction in beam energy means ``broad agreement
that this confidence would be lost,'' the report said.
   A decision on collider spending recommendations is expected from
Energy Secretary James Watkins later this month, officials said.
   The collider is expected to be completed by 1998. Congress last
year approved $225 million to begin initial construction and
President Bush is expected to request about $393 million for the
next fiscal year.
   The department is reviewing cost estimates by SSC Laboratory in
DeSoto, Texas, on how various design changes would affect the price.
   Officials of the SSC Lab, which contracted to build the
accelerator at a site south of Dallas, recommend an increase of
about $1 billion to keep the project essentially as it was
envisioned in 1986.
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said he believes a compromise would be
reached but would not speculate on the new cost estimate.
   ``It's important that we try not to build a Cadillac,'' Gramm
said. ``We don't have the money, and to attempt to do that would
put us in a position where we would have no machine at all.''
   The subpanel said the cost increases would give new ammunition
to Capitol Hill opponents of the giant machine, which if completed
will be the largest, most complicated scientific instrument ever
built.
   Congressional opponents of the collider fear it will draw
resources from other scientific projects that would deliver more
immediate payouts benefitting the nation's economy and
international competitive position.
   The additional costs would have to be absorbed by U.S. taxpayers
or could come from foreign sources.
   While some members of Congress favor letting foreign sources
provide in-kind equipment and services, others fear those countries
would gain immediate technological benefits for their industries,
at U.S. expense.
   James F. Decker, acting director of the department's office of
energy research, said the collider should ``provide a substantial
new physics capability when it comes on line.
   ``The United States should not spend this large amount of money
for a facility that would be only marginally better than some other
existing facility,'' Decker said.

   Eric James Nightlinger decided he'd had
enough of his moody motorcycle, so he dumped the bike off a bridge
for the fun of watching it tumble 75 feet into the San Francisco
Bay.
   Nightlinger became frustrated when his 175cc Yamaha broke down
Thursday morning in heavy traffic on the San Francisco-Oakland Bay
Bridge.
   Highway Patrol Officer Manny Matias, who arrived at the scene
after several passing motorists reported seeing a man struggling to
push a motorcycle over the railing, found Nightlinger walking
toward the toll plaza.
   The 19-year-old told Matias he had no money to fix the
broken-down bike so had pushed it off the bridge.
   Since no witnesses could be located afterward, no charges were
filed.

   Lawmakers rejected a proposal to create a

help enforce a ban on plastic foam cups in the legislative chamber.
   Foam cup in hand, Sen. Ernie Chambers of Omaha introduced his
resolution Friday in response to one adopted the day before barring
lawmakers and their staffs from using such cups.
   Saying the resolution to ban the cups was ``environmental
posturing,'' Chambers responded with his own bill.
   Chambers said the ban was unenforceable without adoption of his
proposal, which would have required the Legislature's Executive
Board to gather 100 Finders of Outlawed Legislative Styrofoam,
FOOLS, to find and report suspected violators of LR231.
   The measure failed on a 4-5 vote.

left vacant by Democrat Robert Garcia.
   On Friday, Foster issued a press release stating he would run.
   ``They just put a `not' in there,'' Foster said. ``The person
who typed it didn't do the proper job.''
   Actually, whoever typed it put three ``nots'' in there, in three
separate sentences.
   ``You know how you give things to someone and don't stay around

   The first release ended with the underlined words ``at this time
I am not a candidate for the 18th Congressional District. Again, I

   The second release omitted the ``nots.''
   Garcia resigned after being convicted of extortion and

   New Jersey has sued Exxon Corp. over a
567,000-gallon oil spill, but New York officials decided not to sue
because the company agreed to pay for an environmental study and
damages.
   Federal officals, meanwhile, said they were prepared to fine the
company $10,000 a day starting Wednesday unless they received a
detailed explanation of the Jan. 2 spill of home heating oil in the
Arthur Kill shipping channel between New Jersey and the New York
City borough of Staten Island.
   New York officials said the spill contaminated a sensitive bird
sanctuary and the cleanup will cost millions. By Friday, the Coast
Guard's tally of dead birds had risen to at least 317, with 48
oil-covered live birds being treated.
   New Jersey Attorney General Peter Perretti Jr. filed a civil
lawsuit Friday in Elizabeth, charging Exxon violated the New Jersey
Spill Act, the state's Water Pollution Control Act and state common
law.
   If Exxon is found liable, it could be hit with fines of $50,000
per day, per violation. The number of alleged violations has not
been determined, Perretti's office said.
   The lawsuit also seeks to force Exxon to pay any of the
``substantial'' expenses the state is incurring because of the
spill, said John Hagerty, a spokesman for the New Jersey Department
of Environmental Protection.
   ``We haven't been able to put a price tag on our environment
yet,'' Hagerty said.
   Exxon spokesman Phil Wetz said the company could not respond to
the lawsuit because its attorneys have not reviewed it.
   Meetings between New York and Exxon officials led to a
last-minute agreement to try to settle differences out of court.
   In a letter to Exxon officials Wednesday, New York Attorney
General Robert Abrams threatened to sue unless the company admitted
its liability and paid for the cleanup.
   Abrams charged that Exxon had created a ``mini-Alaska'' in the
Arthur Kill. Exxon has been criticized for its handling of the
March 28 spill of about 10 million gallons of crude oil from the
grounded Exxon Valdez tanker in Alaska, the nation's largest oil
spill.
   Abrams also said the Arthur Kill spill has contaminated
``critical waterfowl feeding and wetland areas of the
environmentally sensitive Pralls Island bird sanctuary.''
   In response to Abrams' letter, Exxon said it will pay for
``appropriate'' environmental studies of its oil spill, but that it
has accepted responsibility only for ``damages for which it is
liable.''
   Carol Ash, regional director of the New York State Department of
Environmental Conservation, said cleanup and restoration of the
area will run into the millions of dollars.
   Ash said Exxon agreed that New York's environmental agency will
oversee damage assessment and the company will not participate in
determining the extent of the damage.
   In New Jersey, Hagerty said Exxon has neither agreed nor refused
to pay the bill.
   The federal Environmental Protection Agency, meanwhile, has
given Exxon until Wednesday to explain how the spill occurred, what
the company's response was to protect the environment and what is
being done to restore the environment. The agency threatened fines
of $10,000 a day.
   ``The response from Exxon wasn't what we would have liked,''
said EPA spokeswoman Kim Helper in New York.
   Helper said her agency was particularly concerned that Exxon
initially estimated only 5,000 gallons of oil had spilled.
   ``When you hear about a 5,000-gallon spill you respond one way.
When you hear about a 500,000-gallon spill you react another way,''
she said.
   Wetz, the Exxon spokesman, said the company would have no
comment on the threatened fines.

<HEAD>Romanians Face Big Task of Rescuing Their Country From Economic
Ruin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By G.G. LABELLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Romanians, flush with the success of
their uprising against Nicolae Ceausescu, now face the formidable
task of repairing the ravaged economy that is the former Communist
dictator's legacy.
   Romanian economists and Western experts say Ceausescu severely
restrained the economy by exporting goods needed at home and
blocking imports that could have modernized the country's
antiquated industries.
   The harsh program managed to pay off a $10.5 billion foreign
debt, but it also left Romanian homes cold and people with only
basic staples to eat.
   ``How could one man do more than an economic tornado?'' asked
Mircea Pirjol, spokesman for the provisional government's Economy
Ministry.
   For one, Romania's once healthy export trade in lathes has
disappeared because the makers could not import modern calibration
equipment, said Eugen Dijmarescu, a researcher at Bucharest's
Institute for World Economy.
   Ironically, the lack of foreign debt and the low production
costs fostered by Ceausescu's policies could help revive the
economy.
   The dictator, ousted Dec. 22 and executed three days later, was
replaced by an interim government headed by the National Salvation
Front, which plans to hold free elections as early as April.
   The country's immediate need is for help in providing food and
heating for Romania's 23 million people during the long harsh
winter. The Soviet Union already has promised fuel oil, and the
United States and France have said they are working on aid programs.
   Pirjol says economists trying to solve long-range problems must
first find out exactly where the country stands since most economic
statistics from Ceausescu's 24 years in power cannot be trusted.
   Asked about production figures, Pirjol replied: ``God knows. All
the economic data was falsified.''
   One example is grain production. Before Ceausescu was toppled
Dec. 22, the government reported a 1989 harvest of 60 million tons.
The provisional government recently said the real figure was 16.9
million tons.
   Dijmarescu said industrial production figures were just as
uncertain.
   ``Last year Ceausescu said that one-third of industrial capacity
was not properly employed. If he said that, you can imagine the
problem is much greater,'' said Dijmarescu, whose private institute
has been hired by the goverment to help plan Romania's economic
future.
   A Western diplomatic source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, estimated that less than 5 percent of Romania's industry
was working at capacity.
   Dijmarescu said that not all Romania's economic problems could
be blamed on Ceausescu.
   Communist policies before his time devastated the once-rich farm
economy by driving peasants into cities for jobs in industry and
collectivizing what had been profitable small farms.
   But Ceausescu held to his policy of expanding heavy industry and
developing grandiose projects when other East Bloc countries
recognized the need for new trade policies.
   For the past five years, 60 percent of the country's meat was
sent abroad. Homes and factories were kept cold and dimly lighted
so petroleum products could be exported.
   At the same time, virtually all imports were blocked.
   This did more than leave consumers crying for Western goods. It
denied modern technology to factories and meant Romanian goods were
without the imported components that could have made them saleable.
   Ceausescu announced last April that Romania had succeeded in
wiping out the 1982 foreign debt of $10.5 billion, but he did not
withdraw austerity measures, perhaps raising the public anger that
brought his downfall. In fact, food rationing was expanded in
October.
   Dijmarescu says the first needs are to revive agriculture and
upgrade industrial technology.
   ``For years people in this county have been in a black hole in
terms of knowledge,'' he said. ``We need an inflow of economic and
scientific information. We need to train people to manage a market
economy.''
   The Western diplomatic source said it will not be possible to
privatize some of Romania's huge heavy industries for years.
   One of the country's assets could be its agriculture, already
being pushed by a decision of the interim government to give land
to peasants. Another plus could be light industry _ such as
textiles and shoes _ if technology in factories can be upgraded
quickly.
   Dijmarescu warned that Romania will have to avoid economic
shocks that could lead to social tensions. He noted that one dated
heavy equipment factory has 20,000 workers and added: ``You can't
just close down a factory with that many employees.''

   Police in three states knew about the
nomadic life in tents, the code words, camouflage clothing and
cultish worship services of Jeffrey Lundgren and his followers.
   But they could find no reason to arrest anyone until it was too
late _ nine months after a family of five had been killed, possibly
as a sacrifice in a misbegotten reading of Mormon teachings.
   For more than a year, agents in Missouri, Ohio and West Virginia
exchanged information about the cult, authorities said, but they
were hard-pressed to build a case.
   In fact, Lundgren and his clan seemd like good neighbors, making
improvements on the farm they rented near this northeast Ohio town,
25 miles east of Cleveland, said Kirtland Police Chief Dennis
Yarborough.
   ``The family had started adding things like siding,'' Yarborough
said. ``They were acting and appearing like good citizens. It was
kind of a paradox.''
   On Jan. 3 and 4, acting on an anonymous tip, federal and local
officials dug under a barn on the farm and found the bodies of
Dennis Avery, 49; his wife, Cheryl, 42; and their three daughters,
Trina, 15; Rebecca, 13; and Karen, 7.
   The Lake County coroner's office said all five had been bound
hand and foot with duct tape, with tape covering their mouths and
eyes, and shot one at a time.
   Investigators said the Averys, who lived nearby, had been
members of the cult but were not as fervent as some of the other
followers.
   Last week, the 39-year-old Lundgren, a former lay minister of
the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, was
arrested with his wife, teen-age son and 10 other followers in
scattered cities, mostly around San Diego.
   Yarborough said Friday there was speculation that Lundgren felt
people had to die ``as part of a cleansing ritual'' so the cult
could relocate in the wilderness.
   The Rev. Dale Luffman, pastor of Kirtland's Reorganized Church,
has theorized the killings stemmed from fights over money, sex or
the possibility the Averys would leave the cult.
   Lundgren came to Kirtland from the Independence, Mo., area in
1984 to work as a tour guide at a Mormon temple used by the
Reorganized Church.
   The Reorganized Church, based in Independence, split in the last
century from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the
Mormon Church, which is based in Salt Lake City. Both churches
remain rooted in the Book of Mormon and in the writings of founder
Joseph Smith.
   Luffman said Lundgren at first seemed devoted enough in his
tours and his Sunday-school teachings but later became menacing.
   ``He apparently felt the leaders of the church were part of the
unrighteous around the temple and needed to be eradicated _ that
was the term he used,'' Luffman said.
   Lundgren began seeing himself as a prophet, using his lay
ministry and tour job as forums to recruit followers, Luffman said.
   The church defrocked him in January 1988, but he was able to
find a dozen or more people who listened. Some came to Kirtland, at
his urging, from the Independence church he had attended. The
followers quit jobs and sold their belongings cheap to make the
move, bewildered friends said.
   The followers moved in with Lundgren on the farm, living commune
style, turning over their paychecks from outside employment and
letting him read their mail and listen in on their telephone calls,
police said.
   The group fit the classic description of a cult, Luffman said.
   ``They acknowledge and take their direction and allegiance to a
leader with an authorized message. Second, there takes place a
separation from all other groups ... friends and family,'' he said.
   The Kansas City office of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms at one point warned Kirtland authorities that Lundgren
had spoken of a Sword of Laban that would be used to decapitate
people while ``taking over'' the temple in Kirtland. There is
mention of a Sword of Laban in the Book of Mormon.
   Eventually, male cult members started wearing camouflage
clothing and paramilitary gear, practicing with guns and other
weapons, and adopting code names such as ``Eagle Eye'' and
``Talon-1,'' authorities said.
   Yarborough said that in April 1988 he heard reports of
paramilitary activities and threats against other people.
Authorities investigated the reports, but pressed no charges.
   The group left the Kirtland area in April 1989 and showed up in
Davis, W.Va., a rugged, coal-mining area, where they camped out in
tents until mid-October. They planted a large garden and built a
15-foot wooden bridge across a stream.
   ``I thought, `Gee, they're not doing anything worse than a Boy
Scout group would do,''' Davis conservation officer Harold Spencer
told The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer.
   Lundgren and his followers next traveled to Chilhowee, Mo.,
where they lived in a barn, said Yarborough. Then they disbanded,
probably sometime in December, investigators said.

   On the eve of a visit to the United States by
Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani, both his government and the
leftist rebels are showing signs of moderating their policies with
an eye on the U.S. Congress.
   The State Department on Friday welcomed as a ``positive
development'' a rebel announcement that they are willing to renew
peace negotiations with the U.S.-backed government under United
Nations auspices.
   The rebels proposed a meeting within 30 days and the government
accepted the offer but U.S. officials noted that previous attempts
since 1984 to negotiate a settlement have all failed.
   The timing of the rebel announcement suggested an interest in
generating good will with Congress, where there is some sentiment
for scaling back on U.S. aid commitment to the government.
   Some lawmakers called the aid commitment into question following
the massacre of six Jesuit priests two months ago. Cristiani
blunted that criticism somewhat last weekend when he said
``elements of the armed forces'' were responsible for the killings.
   This indicated Salvadoran authorities were serious about their
investigation. Nonetheless, Cristiani, whose government is heavily
dependent on U.S. military and economic aid for its survival, is
expected to face tough questions from members of Congress when he
visits Washington next week.
   Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass., said Friday Cristiani has predicted
the investigation into the murders of the priests will be completed
within a week.
   Moakley, chairman of a House task force on El Salvador, said the
probe has made ``substantial progress but I worry that the
possibility of a coverup remains.''
   ``Those who ordered or otherwise consented to the crime must
also be brought to justice,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, representatives of international organizations said
Friday that relief workers in El Salvador are being harassed and
even tortured by the military. But they said Cristiani seemed
willing to end those abuses.
   ``Churches, social welfare organizations, trade unions and
associations of cooperatives have had staff detained and offices
raided, ransacked and sometimes destroyed or occupied by the
military,'' said a statement from a six-member delegation of the
International Council for Voluntary Agencies.
   ``Files and office equipment have been confiscated and
international staff colleagues expelled,'' said the delegation,
which just completed a three-day tour of El Salvador and a visit to
Capitol Hill and the State Department.
   The council, based in Geneva, represents organizations involved
in humanitarian relief and development cooperation.

<HEAD>FBI Agent Says Individual, Not Group, May Be Behind Attacks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Some investigators are leaning toward the theory
that an elderly loner, rather than an organized racist group, is
behind mail bomb attacks in three states that left a judge and an
attorney dead.
   ``We feel he is 50 or older, is a loner and someone not known to
associate with any of the white hate groups,'' said FBI special
agent Charles Archer of Mobile, Ala. ``We have no information that
the (Ku Klux) Klan or any similar groups are involved in any of the
bombings.''
   But in Atlanta, the man who is coordinating the federal
investigation of the bombs said the case has not yet been narrowed
to a single suspect.
   ``There are suspects all over the place,'' said FBI Special
Agent William Hinshaw of Atlanta.
   Early in the investigation of the December mail bombings,
authorities said it appeared an organized white supremacist group
could be responsible. A letter claimed responsibility for the
attacks in the name of the previously unknown ``Americans for a
Competent Federal Judicial System.''
   Al Adams, a spokesman for the Postal Inspection Service in
Atlanta, which also is involved in the investigation, said
authorities are not close enough yet to solving the case that
anyone can be ruled out.
   But he said he believed that if a large group were involved in
the plot, at least one member by now would have come forward.
   ``Even though a white supremacist group is subject to do this,
someone would disagree with murdering a federal judge,'' Adams said.
   Adams said the large number of leads in the case have been
divided among the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
and his office.
   The FBI, meanwhile, confirmed that threatening letters have been
sent to five judges or courts in Ohio, including the Supreme Court.
   Douglass Ogden, senior supervisor in charge of the FBI's
Columbus, Ohio, office, would not say whether the letters contained
death threats or disclose further details.
   He said threats against judges are not unusual. ``But attention
is being a little more focused because of what is going on down
South,'' he said.
   The bombs killed 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Robert
Vance near Birmingham, Ala., and Savannah, Ga., civil rights
attorney Robert Robinson. Bombs delivered to the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court offices in Atlanta and to an NAACP office in Jacksonville,
Fla., were safely intercepted.

<HEAD>Four Cities, Southwest Border Targeted in Drug War</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials plan to send extra money and
resources to New York City, Miami, Houston, Los Angeles and almost
the entire Southwest border to fight drug trafficking, according to
administration sources.
   The sources, speaking to The Associated Press on condition of
anonymity, said the metropolitan areas and border region are to be
designated high-intensity drug trafficking areas, qualifying them
for the new federal assistance.
   It is unclear how much help those areas will get because of the
designation. In the current fiscal year, only $25 million has been
allocated for high-intensity localities.
   However, that could increase by up to $21 million with money
coming from assets seized from drug traffickers, Reggie Walton,
associate director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy,
said last month.
   An administration official, who spoke Friday on condition of
anonymity, said the total federal effort in the designated areas
``probably will be over $1 billion,'' when such things as
temporarily reassigned federal agents and military efforts along
the border are figured in.
   An updated National Drug Control Strategy _ required by Congress
_ is expected to be announced at the end of January. The original
version was announced by President Bush last September.
   Sources contacted by the AP Friday had seen drafts of the new
strategy, which went to the White House Domestic Policy Council on
Thursday and to Bush on Friday.
   One source said the strategy calls for the areas around the
actual cities to be including in the strategy to fight drugs.
   When William J. Bennett, director of the drug control office,
designated Washington, D.C., as a test case for future
high-intensity drug trafficking areas last spring, leaders of
surrounding cities and counties protested that the problems don't
end at the capital's borders. They suggested that problems could
simply be pushed into the surrounding areas.
   In addition to the metropolitan areas, the new strategy
designates 34 counties along the Southwest border as high-intensity
drug-trafficking areas.
   The strategy also outlines broader federal drug crimes for which
the death penalty can be imposed, in line with the changes Bush
said he wanted to make last year. Under the proposals, the death
penalty could be imposed on drug kingpins even when they or their
organizations have not killed anyone.
   The death penalty could be imposed if the attorney general
approves the indictment and if, on conviction, the jury found
serious aggravating factors, a source said. ``This is basically
following through on implementing the president's agenda vis a vis
nasty, felonious drug traffickers,'' the source said.
   Interdiction efforts by the Customs Service and the Coast Guard
will not get more money under the strategy. But military
expenditures on border control will increase from some $313 million
in 1990 to about $1.2 billion in 1991.

<HEAD>Judge Meets With Noriega Attorneys; Co-Defendant's Bail Set</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Manuel Noriega's attorneys met with his trial judge
amid speculation the government would move the ousted Panamanian
dictator from the courthouse basement to a more secure federal
facility.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler met with Noriega's
attorneys in a closed-door session Friday, reportedly to discuss
the government's interest in moving him to federal prisons in
Atlanta or Marion, Ill.
   Noriega attorney Frank Rubino said he would fight any effort to
move Noriega from south Florida on the grounds that it would make
it difficult for him to meet with his client.
   Hoeveler refused to comment on the meeting.
   Noriega is accused in a February 1988 federal indictment of
using Panama to protect cocaine shipments heading north and
southbound drug-processing chemicals and drug money.
   Rubino said he and co-counsel Steven Kollin have been joined on
the defense team by David Lewis of New York.
   Lewis, an attorney in the ``Pizza Connection'' mob case, is
considered an expert on the federal Classified Information
Protection Act, expertise needed because of Noriega's longtime
association with the CIA.
   The New York office of attorney Barry Slotnick, who represented
subway gunman Bernhard Goetz, issued a statement Friday saying the
firm ``has decided it does not wish to be part of the (Noriega)
defense effort.''
   Houston attorney Richard ``Racehorse'' Haynes also was reported
to have expressed interest in the Noriega case.
   But Rubino told The Associated Press Friday that when he
mentioned Slotnick and Haynes to Noriega, the deposed dictator said
he had not contacted them.
   ``He told me that he is satisfied with our representation and
whoever we get,'' Rubino said. ``David Lewis is the first we've
added, but we're going to get four or six more from all over the
country _ the best in their fields, in their specialties.''
   U.S. Magistrate Peter Palermo on Friday set bail at $1 million
for Noriega co-defendant Daniel Miranda, 36, who is charged with
flying $800,000 in drug money from Fort Lauderdale to Panama.
   Miranda's attorney, Michael O'Kane, said they would be able to
post the bond. But prosecutors immediately filed an appeal of the
ruling and temporarily blocked his client's release.
   O'Kane appeared in court with a bandaged head and explained that
he had been attacked by a masked man with a crowbar in front of his
home.
   Police later said they had a suspect in the attack in custody,
and identified him as a person hired by a former client of the
attorney's.

   Here is a brief look at the Long
Duration Exposure Facility satellite which has been in space for
nearly six years:
   _ LDEF carries coating and thermal systems experiments; five
power and propulsion experiments; 17 science experiments; 14
electronics and optics experiments and 21 materials used in space
flight, including metals, graphite epoxies, polymers, resins and
thermal coatings. Scientists want to know if materials' strength
properties changed and if mechanical systems still work.
   _ Experts will also study the satellite's frame, bolts,
batteries and electric motors to see how it survived the long space
trip.
   _ Experiments on LDEF have been subjected to space's environment
_ extreme temperatures, a near-vacuum, microgravity,
micrometeoroids, cosmic radiation, corrosive atomic oxygen, and
other things from outer space.
   _ Some other experiments aboard include one designed to collect
interplanetary dust that could reveal information about the sun and
planets. Also aboard are 12.5 million tomato seeds for student
experiments and research into such things as germination rates,
chromosome and population genetics studies and full tomato growth.
   _ The satellite will be taken to an extremely clean building at
the Kennedy Space Center for examination by teams expert in
materials, spacecraft systems, radiation and space debris. The
experiments will then be distributed to their individual
investigators.

<HEAD>Joint U.S.-Soivet Bering Strait Park Planned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and Soviet Union are
expanding their environmental cooperation, including plans for an
international park spanning the Bering Strait.
   Acting under a 1972 agreement, the Environmental Protection
Agency and its Soviet counterpart are expanding cooperation into 45
areas, including the exchange of information on scientific and
regulatory issues, officials from the two agencies said Friday.
   Taking their cue from the United States, for example, the
Soviets are ``developing a program in which leaded gas would be
banned'' by 1996 or 1998, said Valentin G. Sokolovskiy, deputy
chairman of the State Committee on Environmental Protection.
   William K. Reilly, the EPA administrator, said cooperation would
include preparation for a conference on global warming proposed by
President Bush at the superpower summit in Malta last month.
   ``We began the week with 37 projects and we ended with about
45,'' Reilly told the news conference. Areas of cooperation
included:
   _Remote sensing of atmospheric pollutants.
   _Wetlands management.
   _Historic preservation.
   _Seismological monitoring, along the lines of an exchange of
scientists that took place after the 1988 earthquake in Soviet
Armenia and the tremor that shook San Francisco last October.
   By the end of 1991 the U.S. and Soviet governments hope to form
a jointly managed preserve on both sides of the Bering Strait that
separates Alaska and Siberia, said an EPA spokesman, Sean McElheny.
The plan stems from talks the two nations held last September, he
said.
   For years, Soviet officials denied they had significant
environmental problems, but the issue has been widely discussed
under the reforms of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The greater Soviet emphasis on environmental problems has lent
new energy to official U.S.-Soviet meetings on the issue, of which
the four-day session this week was the 12th.
   Moscow's new interest in the environment has created some stress
in the official relationship, however, because, unlike the American
delegate, the Soviet entourage included a representative from a
recently formed non-government group.
   The private Soviet delegate was Maria V. Cherkasova, of the
Social-Ecological Union, formed in December 1988 as a consortium of
some 120 groups in 260 cities and towns.
   The Soviet environment is in a disastrous state requiring
``urgent attention,'' she said, stressing problems with children's
health.
   ``I feel that great movement has been made in the past year'' by
the Soviet government to protect the environment, she told
reporters after the news conference. ``But it seems that the
American side does not realize the full extent'' of Soviet
environmental problems, she said.
   During her stay, she said she formed contacts with several
private U.S. environmental groups, including the Natural Resources
Defense Council, Greenpeace International, the Audubon Society and
the Sierra Club.
   David Wirth, an attorney from the Natural Resources Defense
Council, complained in a statement read at a bilateral session on
Wednesday that the original 1972 agreement was ``underutilized.''
   Wirth proposed U.S.-Soviet cooperation to curb emissions of
carbon dioxide, which are widely blamed for a perceived global
warming trend. And he said the two governments should monitor joint
business ventures to ensure that U.S. pollutants, such as some
pesticides, are not sold to the Soviets.

   The wife of the cult leader charged in the
murders of five members of a family will waive extradition
procedures and return voluntarily to Ohio, reversing an earlier
decision, her attorney said.
   Alice Lundgren, 38, who has been jailed at the Las Colinas
Women's Detention Facility since she being captured with her
husband and son last Sunday, will appear in court Tuesday to sign
the extradition waiver, attorney Kay Sunday said.
   ``I happen to believe she's innocent,'' Sunday said Friday
night. ``She wants to go back and start working on her case and so
it can come out that she's innocent. She has nothing to hide.''
   Mrs. Lundgren last Tuesday joined her husband, Jeffrey Lundgren,
39, and son, Damon, in refusing at a court hearing to waive
extradition procedures.
   The three have been indicted, along with 10 others, in the
alleged ritualistic slayings of Dennis and Cheryl Avery and their
three young daughters.
   The refusals by the Lundgrens triggered formal extradition
proceedings that could take 90 days to bring about the fugitives'
forced return.
   Sunday said Mrs. Lundgren had nothing do with the killings. She
declined to elaborate.
   ``I probably will have more to say after her extradition on
Tuesday but I can't say anything right now,'' Sunday said. ``What I
can say is she's in the safest place she's been in a long time and
she doesn't have anything to fear, now.''
   Mrs. Lundgren's husband and son are jailed without bail at a
separate facility.
   Lundgren, a self-proclaimed prophet, was a lay minister in the
Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Ohio
before being ousted for radical teachings.
   He persuaded other members to follow him after his ouster and
the splinter group went to live on a 15-acre farm near Kirtland,
Ohio, where the Averys' bodies were unearthed last week. They
apparently were slain in April.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Barbara Bush is finished with the radiation
treatments for a stubborn eye ailment that has impaired her vision
but will not know for at least two months how effective the
treatments have been.
   The first lady underwent the last of 10 radiation treatments on
Friday, said Anna Perez, Mrs. Bush's press secretary.
   After receiving the 10-minute radiation dose at Walter Reed Army
Medical Center, Mrs. Bush returned to the White House and took her
daily swim in the outdoor, heated swimming pool, said Ms. Perez.
   She also attended a briefing on the Head Start education
program, hosting volunteers from the organization.
   ``She feels great,'' said Ms. Perez.
   Doctors will not know for at least two months, and maybe as long
as four, whether the radiation was effective in treating the
symptoms of Graves' disease, an immune system disorder that earlier
affected Mrs. Bush's thyroid as well, said Ms. Perez.
   Mrs. Bush began the radiation treatments after the steroid drug
prednisone failed to improve her eyes. She suffers eye irritation,
double vision and bulging eyes as a result of the Graves' disease,
which was diagnosed early last year.
   The disease initially caused her thyroid to be overproductive,
but a one-time radioactive treatment rendered the thyroid inactive
and cured that effect of the disease.
   The low-level radiation treatments were intended to decrease
swelling behind the eyes, in the small muscles that control eye
movement.
   Although suffering from eye irritation, Mrs. Bush has maintained
a schedule of public appearances, both with her husband and by
herself.
   Should the radiation fail, surgery would be an option, experts
say.

   Even before the article was published, the
foreign policy establishment and the academic world were abuzz.
When it appeared, copies of a high-brow journal with a slender
circulation were suddenly in high demand.
   The article in Daedalus was about U.S.-Soviet relations and it
was signed with the provocative pseudonym ``Z,'' a clear allusion
to the 1947 article, signed ``X,'' that laid the theoretical
framework for the Cold War policy of containment.
   X's article, published in the journal Foreign Affairs, later was
acknowledged to be the work of George F. Kennan, a State Department
official who later became ambassador to the Soviet Union and one of
the nation's leading diplomats.
   Speculation about the identity of Z began last Thursday, when
excerpts from the Daedalus article appeared on the opinion page of
The New York Times. Washington was soon alive with rumors that the
author was a well-placed government official _ perhaps even a
well-placed Soviet government official.
   The article takes a dim view of Mikhail Gorbachev's chances of
making the Soviet system economically efficient and politically
democratic while maintaining the primacy of the Communist Party.
   ``The fundamental structures of the Leninist system reached an
inextricable impasse at the end of the 1970s, and the mounting
contradictions of perestroika indicate that the system cannot be
restructured or reformed, but can only stagnate or be dismantled
and replaced by market institutions over a long period of time,'' Z
wrote.
   Daedalus, a literary and philosophical quarterly published by
the 210-year-old American Academy of Arts and Sciences in
Cambridge, Mass., printed 23,000 copies of today's edition _ 3,000
more than usual _ and expects to issue many reprints, said its
editor, Stephen Graubard.
   Graubard, however, was hardly ecstatic about his publishing
coup. Instead, the 65-year-old editor was ruminating about the
``frivolity'' of the American media _ and fuming about allegations
that the pseudonym was hype.
   ``I want people to read it and say whether they agree or
disagree,'' Graubard said in a telephone interview. ``This is a
very serious subject, and so far I have yet to see an analysis of
what was said _ as opposed to a guessing game about who said it.''
   Graubard refused to name the author or explain why a pseudonym
was used, except to say that there were ``compelling reasons'' to
protect the writer's identity.
   As to the allegation by columnist Patrick Buchanan that the Z
byline was ``just clever hype,'' Graubard was indignant.
   ``All you have to do is read Daedalus to know we don't go in for
hype,'' he said.
   Z argues that it is futile for the United States to try to help
Gorbachev succeed in his avowed aims of democratizing the communist
system and revitalizing the Soviet economy.
   But the article contends the West can play a constructive role,
primarily by investing in the Soviet Union's emerging private
sector _ ``without triumphalism about capitalism's superiority, and
with due sensitivity to Soviet national pride.''
   ``The West's aim should be to encourage the change of Soviet
realities while leaving the old labels intact,'' the article says.
   The Arkansas Democrat reported today that it had determined Z
was retired Lt. Gen. William Odom, the former director of the
National Security Agency. The newspaper quoted William E. Jackson
Jr., an international relations professor at the University of
Arkansas as saying Odom, a close friend, was Z.
   Odom, reached Friday in Middlebury, Vt., gave a cryptic
response. He denied that he was Z, but said the newspaper's
reporter would be correct in quoting Jackson.
   ``You can write what he says,'' said Odom, who in September was
quoted as warning that it was unlikely a liberal democracy would be
established in the Soviet Union, and that reforms there could lead
to chaos.
   Much of the speculation about Z's identity has focused on Robert
M. Gates, President Bush's deputy national security adviser.
   Gates had planned to give a speech late last year expressing
pessimism about Gorbachev's chances of success, but was blocked by
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who reportedly felt such
sentiments were inappropriate about the time of the Malta summit.
   Gates denied through the White House press office on Friday that
he is Z.
   Another possible author is Zbigniew Brzezinski, former national
security adviser under President Carter. Brzezinski declined to
discuss the article, but did not expressly deny writing it.
   New York Times writer Flora Lewis suggested in her column today
that Z was Dennis Ross, head of the State Department's policy
planning staff.
   After the original ``X'' article appeared in July 1947, Kennan
was identified as the author within a matter of days. Now a
historian at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, N.J.,
Kennan declined to discuss the Z article.
   Graubard said he believes Z's article is ``infinitely more
provocative'' than the Mr. X article was in its day, but not all
scholars agreed.
   ``The sense of it is that we should help the Russians right now,
but whether Gorbachev succeeds or fails is going to be decided
inside the Soviet Union,'' said Adam Ulam, director of the Russian
Research Center at Harvard University. ``It's a sensible but not
terribly original point of view.''

<HEAD>Cheney Could Cut Minuteman 2 Missiles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force is proposing to retire all 450
Minuteman 2 intercontinental ballistic missiles at a savings of
$400 million a year, a newspaper reported today.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has tentatively accepted the
proposal, The Washington Post said, and will discuss it with
congressional leaders next week before making a final decision.
   A Defense Department spokesman, Air Force Lt. Col. Richard
Oborn, said late Friday that he had no information on the matter.
   The newspaper quoted unnamed officials who cautioned that
President Bush might withdraw the proposal before he presents his
fiscal year 1991 budget to Congress on Jan. 29.
   Meanwhile, Cheney on Friday ordered a freeze on hiring civilians
at the Defense Department for the rest of this fiscal year. Cheney
said in a statement he took the step to cut costs and because of
sweeping international changes.
   The release announcing the step cautioned that ``department
officials do not know how much the work force will be reduced by
the freeze.''
   In effect until Sept. 30, the hiring freeze applies to all
Department of Defense civilians worldwide, including part-time and
temporary employees. The department currently employs 927,000
civilians full-time and another 123,000 on a temporary or part-time.
   As many as 80,000 workers normally retire or otherwise leave
that work force each year, the Pentagon said.
   The Minuteman 2, based at Malmstrom Air Force Base, Mont.;
Ellsworth Air Force Base, S.D., and Whiteman Air Force Base, Mo.,
carries a single warhead with an explosive force estimated at 1.2
megatons, or the equivalent of 1.2 million tons of TNT. That is 80
times the power of the atomic bomb that destroyed the Japanese city
of Hiroshima in 1945.
   These are the last warheads in the U.S. arsenal greater than one
megaton in destructive power.
   Compared with later missiles, the Minuteman 2 is relatively
inaccurate. Published estimates say half the missiles launched
would land within 1,200 feet to 2,000 feet of the point of aim.
   Similar estimates for the 550 deployed Minuteman 3 missiles,
which carry three smaller warheads, are from 600 feet to 700 feet.
   In addition to the Minuteman, the nation's land-based missiles
include 50 MX ``Peacekeeper'' missiles with 10 warheads each.
Counting other missiles and bombs, the Minuteman 2 force represents
about 3.5 percent of the nation's strategic nuclear warheads.
   The Bush administration has proposed building a new
``Midgetman'' single-warhead missile that could be moved about on
giant trucks, much more difficult to hit than known, fixed
positions such as current Minuteman silos.
   Because they are so old and inaccurate, the Minuteman 2 missiles
have been candidates for retirement for some time. The
administration told Congress last summer that a likely strategic
nuclear arms treaty with the Soviet Union would mean significant
reductions in missiles on both sides.

<TEXT>
   A 1990s Disneyland expansion that will
draw on the power of Hollywood and the charm of Disney's cartoon
characters has been unveiled along with plans for a second Southern
California park.
   Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner on Friday detailed plans
for more than a dozen new rides, shows and films in two new
Disneyland theme areas and an updated Tomorrowland section.
   Eisner dubbed the '90s the ``Disney decade,'' citing the
scheduled opening of a $2.5 billion European Disneyland, expansion
of Disney World in Florida and growing attendance at the Tokyo
Disneyland.
   He said negotiations for construction of a second theme park are
under way with city officials in Anaheim and Long Beach, where
Disney already owns the historic Queen Mary ocean liner and Spruce
Goose wooden seaplane attractions. The original Disney theme park
in Anaheim, 30 miles south of Los Angeles, is celebrating its 35th
anniversary this year. An expansion billed as the most ambitious in
the park's history will begin in 1991, with themes based on the
films of George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and others.
   A new theme area to be completed in early 1999 will recreate the
'30s and '40s movie era, with an ``idealized Hollywood Boulevard''
offering shops and restaurants.
   Hollywoodland also will include ``Toontown Trolley'' and ``Baby
Herman's Runaway Baby Buggy Ride'' attractions based on the
Spielberg-produced movie ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit?''
   Also planned is a ``Great Movie Ride,'' which debuted at the
Disney-MGM Studios at Walt Disney World last year and which puts
parkgoers in the middle of classic movie scenes.
   Disney operates theme parks and resorts in Anaheim, Orlando,
Fla., Tokyo and the one under construction in Paris. The
Burbank-based company has pumped an estimated $1.5 billion into its
expanding parks during the past five years.

<HEAD>Marcos Friend To Appeal Ruling Of Liability In Murder Of Regime
Foes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two allies of former Philippines ruler Ferdinand
Marcos were found liable in the murders of two cannery union
members and ordered to pay their survivors at least $8.4 million.
   U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein found conclusive evidence
Friday that Constantine ``Tony'' Baruso and Leonilo Malabed drew
from a fund established to battle Marcos opponents in the United
States to arrange the deaths of Silme Domingo and Gene Viernes,
slain in the Seattle offices of the Alaska Cannery Workers Union in
1981.
   ``This is wonderful,'' said Jeff Robinson, one of the attorneys
for the families.
   Rothstein's ruling awarded $6,669,000 to the estate of Domingo
and $1,727,800 to Viernes' survivors, with a ``pain and suffering''
portion to be decided later.
   Malabed's attorney, Kate Alfieri of San Francisco, said she
would appeal the ruling. Baruso's attorney, Anthony Savage of
Seattle, could not be reached for comment.
   Baruso was president of the union when the killings occurred.
Although his gun was used in the shootings, he was never criminally
charged.
   Malabed allegedly ran Marcos' West Coast intelligence operation
and controlled a slush fund for ``security projects'' against
Marcos opponents.
   His testimony ``vacillated between a total lack of memory and
outright fabrication,'' said Rothstein, who concluded Malabed's
fund provided Baruso $15,000 for the murders.
   Baruso was found liable for conspiracy to monitor, harass,
intimidate and operate against Marcos opponents while Malabed was
found liable for the conspiracy charge and for negligence for not
keeping the intelligence operations in check.
   The late Marcos and his wife, Imelda, were found liable on Dec.
15 for running an intelligence network that spied on foes of his
regime. They were ordered to pay $15 million to the families of
Domingo and Viernes. Marcos was ousted as president of the
Philippines in 1986 and fled to Hawaii, where he died in September.
   Michael Withey, lead attorney for the plaintiffs, said he would
meet Monday with King County Prosecutor Norm Maleng about reopening
a criminal investigation of the case.
   Three men were convicted in 1981 and 1982 of murdering Domingo
and Viernes but those trials did not conclude the existence of a
Marcos-linked conspiracy, although testimony indicated Baruso
traveled to San Francisco and picked up $15,000 from a Philippines
intelligence fund to pay for the killings.
   Malabed, in depositions, admitted he maintained a fund through
the Mabuhay Corp. from which he made payments to a Philippines
official for ``broadcast projects'' in this country. He maintained
that he did not know specifically where that money went.
   Malabed also admitted he signed a Mabuhay expense account that
listed several ``special security projects,'' including a May 17,
1981, entry for $15,000 that plaintiffs claimed was used to pay for
the murders.
   Baruso denied he knew Malabed, but Rothstein said she found the
plaintiffs presented overwhelming evidence that Baruso was directly
involved in the murders of Domingo and Viernes.
   She said Baruso promised to pay $5,000 to the killers and that
the murder weapon was Baruso's.
   The civil trial had a lower standard of proof than the ``beyond
a reasonable doubt'' proof required in criminal trials. The
conspiracy count required a showing of ``clear, cogent and
convincing'' evidence, and the negligence count a showing of a
``preponderance'' of evidence.

<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said
today that a timetable for direct elections in Hong Kong would be
set in the next few weeks, despite worsening ties with China.
   Arriving in Hong Kong, Hurd also said the colony will continue
its forced repatriation of Vietnamese boat people even though the
move has prompted widespread international condemnation.
   Hurd said he expected ground rules to be set soon for elections
in Hong Kong next year. China, which takes over the colony in 1997,
has called efforts to speed up the democratization of the territory
a plot ``to bring the Chinese government to its knees.''
   Hurd said that while Britain would consider Beijing's views, it
would decide by itself how to proceed with the voting.
   ``We are not going to sit back as the British government
passively and let the clock tick on,'' he told reporters at Hong
Kong's international airport.
   ``Cool and considered'' was how he described the way decisions
will be made that will critically effect the lives of Hong Kong's
5.7 million people.
   Communist China takes over Hong Kong in 1997 and has promised to
preserve Hong Kong's free-wheeling economic and social system for
at least 50 years. But confidence in China's promise evaporated
after the bloody crackdown June 3-4 on the movement for democracy
in Beijing.
   Relations between Hong Kong and the mainland have sunk to their
lowest level since the ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution of the
1960s. A series of disagreements between London and Beijing and
pro-democracy agitation in Hong Kong have further worsened ties.
   To complicate the issue, many in Hong Kong feel Britain has
abandoned the colony and is kowtowing to the Beijing government.
Protests are expected during Hurd's visit and security will be
tight.
   His visit, his first to Hong Kong as foreign secretary, follows
unproductive meetings between Hong Kong's governor, Sir David
Wilson, and Chinese leaders in Beijing. Wilson returned Friday and
will confer with Hurd.
   The governor had sharp exchanges with several Chinese leaders
over the pace of democratic change in Hong Kong. Wilson called the
talks ``frank,'' and Hurd described them as ``workman-like,''
diplomatic buzzwords for unsuccessful.
   Time is running out for determining the future of the colony. A
committee of Chinese-appointed officials is expected to complete by
March the Basic Law, the blueprint for the territory after 1997.
   The main point of contention concerns the pace and extent of
democraticization in this colony, one of Asia's economic successes.
   China wants only 30 percent of the legislature, or 18 seats,
elected after 1997 but Britain has been pushing for about 50
percent.
   The executive and legislative branches of Hong Kong's current
government have called for at least 20 seats to be put up for
election in 1991.
   British and Hong Kong activists say a quicker transition to
democracy would create a political system better able to withstand
an unstable government in Beijing.
   But with hard-liners firmly in power, China's leadership views
talk of more democracy in Hong Kong as a threat. Hong Kong's
economy and society have far greater influence on China's 1 billion
people than its comparatively small population would suggest.
   Hurd said the ground rules for the 1991 elections would be the
``first step on a new path for Hong Kong, direct elections.''
   Hurd also pledged that Britain would continue sending Vietnamese
boat people home against their will.
   ``We have set the policy,'' he said. ``We have decided.''
   United Nations talks on the boat people question, originally
scheduled for next week, were postponed Friday in Geneva. The
United States, which opposes Britain's policy, reportedly asked for
the delay.
   More than 40,000 Vietnamese are languishing in squalid detention
centers and will be sent back to Vietnam unless they can prove they
face political persecution in their Communist homeland.

   Greeted by a cheering homecoming crowd,
Teresa Smith said she had no regrets about giving part of her liver
to help save her daughter Alyssa.
   ``I feel real good. She's doing super,'' Mrs. Smith said Friday
night, after she and her 23-month-old daughter stepped off a jet
that brought them home from Chicago. ``We feel like we did what was
best in the medical interest of our child, of Alyssa.''
   About 200 friends, family and city leaders from the Smiths'
hometown of Schertz, a San Antonio suburb, were present to shower
the puzzled-looking toddler and her mother with gifts.
   Her mother said Alyssa was ``sedate'' on the plane ride home.
But Mrs. Smith, her husband John Smith and relieved relatives did
plenty of celebrating.
   ``It's exciting,'' John Smith said. ``They're home _ home for
good.''
   Added his wife: ``It's just good to be home ... This is
overwhelming.''
   Mrs. Smith gave about 40 percent of her liver to her daughter in
November during the nation's first living-donor liver transplant,
at the University of Chicago Medical Center.
   Alyssa suffered from biliary atresia, a congenital disorder that
could have been fatal without the transplant, doctors said. The
girl must visit her San Antonio physicians each week for checkups
and continue taking drugs to prevent her body from rejecting the
new liver.
   ``We've received letters from all over the nation, not only from
parents whose children are in a similar situation, but also from
Alyssa Smiths all over the country,'' her mother said.

   A federal appeals court is ordering the
Federal Communications Commission to reconsider its approval of the
1986 sale of six Spanish-language television stations to a division
of Hallmark Cards.
   A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington
said Friday the commission apparently violated its own rules for
license transfers when it allowed the sale to take place before
completing an investigation into claims that foreigners had
excessive influence over the stations.
   Spanish International Communications Corp. and Bahia de San
Francisco sold the stations to Univision Holdings, a subsidiary of
Kansas City, Mo.-based Hallmark, in 1986 for $309.6 million after
an FCC administrative law judge denied SICC and Bahia's license
renewal applications.
   Hallmark spokesman Charles Hucker on Friday said the case was a
procedural matter and ``We anticipate no impact on us. Univision
continues to operate the stations.''
   Univision paid $286 million for SICC stations KMEX-TV, Los
Angeles; WLTV, Miami; KWEX-TV, San Antonio; WXTV, Paterson, N.J.;
and KFTV, Hanford, Calif. The company paid $23.6 million for
Bahia's KDTV, San Francisco.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee wants congressional auditors to investigate the Food and
Drug Administration's approval of a genetically engineered hormone
to boost cows' milk production.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., asked the General Accounting Office
to investigate a complaint by a fired FDA veterinarian, Dr. Richard
Burroughs, that the agency ignored flaws in a safety study of a
genetically engineered version of bovine somatotropin.
   ``Congress is being asked with increasing frequency to reach
conclusions about whether particular products of biotechnology have
been adequately reviewed and whether use of these products may
present unacceptable risks ...,'' Leahy said in a letter to the GAO.
   A copy of the letter was provided to The Associated Press on
Friday.
   Burroughs told Leahy's staff that he noticed problems with
reproduction and mastitis _ inflamed udders _ in cows injected with
the genetically engineered version of the hormone when he was
assigned in 1986 through 1988 to review private research on it.
   He said FDA toned down his criticism of the research at the
request of chemical companies seeking approval to market the
hormone commercially.
   Richard Lehmann, director of the division of production drugs at
FDA, said milk from cows injected with the genetically engineered
hormone contained no more than normal amounts of bovine
somatotropin and is safe to drink.

   U.S. travelers in China can feel free again to
go out after dark in Beijing as a result of lifting martial law
there, according to the State Department.
   Responding to China's lifting of marital law on Thursday, U.S.
officials said precautions recommended beforehand are no longer in
effect.
   Prior to China's announcement Thursday, the department had
warned travelers to exercise caution in sections of Beijing where
there was a significant presence of armed security forces because
of martial law. Visitors also were advised to refrain from
photographing troops or military installations.
   The new advisory deletes these references to the need for
precautions in Beijing but notes the travelers should still be
aware that visits to certain areas of the country are prohibited
without permission.
   It also notes that there are special restrictions on travel to
the Tibetan capital of Lhasa.
   Chinese authorities imposed martial law on sections of central
Beijing last June as part of an effort to quell anti-government
demonstrations.

   Demonstrations and gunfire were
reported in Albania, but a senior Albanian Communist denied the
accounts and others that emergency security measures had been
imposed.
   The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug and Belgrade television said
Friday that ``something is apparently happening'' over the border
in hard-line Albania and that authorities had taken ``brutal''
measures against dissent. The reports did not elaborate.
   Tanjug said the new security measures ``can be termed a state of
emergency,'' but did not say when they were imposed.
   The news agency did not attribute its information. Belgrade
television cited unconfirmed reports from diplomats and travelers
from Albania, who are rare.
   Milisav Milic, a reporter for Belgrade TV in Yugoslavia's
southern Kosovo province that borders Albania, told The Associated
Press the ``frequent sound of firearms'' was heard Friday from the
direction of Albania.
   Milic, in a telephone interview, quoted an ethnic Albanian
returning home to Kosovo from Albania as saying demonstrations took
place in the towns of Durres, Shkoder and Korcha ``the last couple
of days.''
   The witness also was quoted as saying leaflets by ``dissatisfied
Albanian military officers'' appeared in Tirana, the capital. No
details of their contents were available.
   The Yugoslav newspaper Politika said Thursday a state of
emergency was declared in Shkoder. It said Shkoder, about 60 miles
northwest of Tirana on the Yugoslav border, is the center of
Albanian dissent.
   Foto Cami, a member of Albania's ruling Communist Party
Politburo, rejected recent reports in Yugoslav, Greek and other
foreign media of unrest in his country as ``slander'' and
``anti-Albanian inventions.''
   His remarks came in an interview with Albanian state radio and
television, carried by the official Albanian news agency ATA and
monitored in Vienna, Austria.
   Most of the East bloc's hard-line leaders lost power last year
and Albania is viewed as the last bastion of Stalinism in Eastern
Europe.
   Some Western analysts see it as the next country to undergo
radical change, but its isolation and small population of 3 million
are among the factors that make Albania different from other
communist countries in the region.
   Relations between Albania and Yugoslavia have long been strained
over unrest in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians make up 85 percent of
the Yugoslav province's population.

<TEXT>
   Anti-abortion activists said they were
pleased by the recovery of a New York woman who had an abortion
while she was in a coma after a long fight by her husband to
counter their efforts to save the fetus.
   Doctors of Nancy Klein initially believed her recovery prospects
were slim, and her physician said Friday that the gradual
improvement she has made would have been impossible if she remained
pregnant.
   Doctors performed the operation 11 months ago, after her husband
Martin Klein fought abortion foes all the way to the U.S. Supreme
Court, eventually becoming his wife's legal guardian and gaining
the authority to approve the abortion.
   Dr. Caroline O. McCagg said the woman's recovery has been
spurred by her determination to get home to her husband and their
4-year-old daughter, Arielle, in Upper Brookville, N.Y.
   ``She likes seeing Arielle. That really perks her up,'' said
McCagg.
   McCagg said Mrs. Klein doesn't remember the Dec. 13, 1988 car
collision that put her in a coma when she was 18 weeks pregnant.
She also knows nothing about the controversy surrounding her case,
the doctor said.
   But she can now recall some things from before the accident, and
has recovered her speech, the ability to feed herself and learned
to use a wheelchair to get around the Robert Wood Johnson Jr.
Rehabilitation Institute.
   McCagg said Mrs. Klein's pregnancy would have ruled out the use
of antibiotics and anti-seizure medicines that have contributed to
the woman's recovery.
   ``The abortion has facilitated her rehabilitation,'' the doctor
said. Because of it, she said, ``we could be more vigorous with her
physical therapy.''
   John Short, one of the activists who tried in court to stop the
abortion, said from his Farmingdale, N.Y., home, ``Naturally, I'm
happy for Nancy Klein. I just feel sad the child won't be there to
help her in her recovery.''
   ``I hope she doesn't have to go through the trauma of asking,
`Where is my child,' and having to be told it was killed,'' he said.
   Mrs. Klein was admitted to the institute in March. She began to
communicate last summer, answering yes-and-no questions by pressing
a button, and learned to spell out words on a letter board shortly
after that.
   McCagg, medical director of the institute's Center for Head
Injuries, said Mrs. Klein is able to make it through the tough
therapeutic program when hospital workers tell her, ``This is going
to get you home.''
   Three months ago she began using a wheelchair, and began talking
about two months ago, McCagg said.
   Mrs. Klein's mother, Anne Zusselman of Delray Beach, Fla.,
termed the recovery ``a miracle.''
   Zusselman said her daughter has made two weekend visits to her
Long Island home and has visited her sister, who lives in New
Jersey about a 40-minute drive from the hospital.
   ``We are pleased about Nancy's recovery up 'til now,'' Martin
Klein said. ``We remain hopeful that she will continue to recover
as well in the days ahead.''
   McCagg said complete recovery is unusual in cases involving such
severe head injuries. He said Mrs. Klein is expected to remain in
the hospital for at least six more months.
   Mrs. Klein's treatment has cost at least $250,000, according to
a hospital spokesman, and ``she still has a long way to go. It's
been very slow, very persistent progress,'' McCagg said.

   A teen-ager said police threatened him with a
20-year prison sentence to pressure him into implicating a black
man in the shooting death of pregnant Carole Stuart and the
wounding of her husband.
   Blacks in Boston have criticized police for not initially
considering Stuart a suspect in the Oct. 23 shooting of his wife.
Stuart, who had blamed the attack on a black mugger, committed
suicide Jan. 4 when police got new information that he had shot his
wife and himself.
   The case drew widespread attention because of a dramatic
conversation between Charles Stuart, using his car telephone, and a
police dispatcher in which Stuart eventually directed police to him
and his wife.
   Dereck Jackson, 17, told reporters for two newspapers Friday
that Boston police investigators intimidated him into saying he had
heard William Bennett, 39, confess to shooting the Stuarts in a car
in the city's Mission Hill neighborhood.
   Bennett, who was arrested on an unrelated charge, was never
charged in the Stuart shootings, but was frequently named in police
leaks to reporters in the Stuart case.
   The Boston Globe and Boston Herald today quoted Jackson saying
the only true information he gave authorities was relating a
comment made to him by a friend, Bennett's 15-year-old nephew, Joey
Bennett. Jackson said he asked if William Bennett was involved in
the Stuart shootings and Joey replied, ``Yeah,'' and laughed.
   He said that when he initially refused to go beyond that
statement, Boston Police Detective Peter J. O'Malley called him a
liar and told him he could go to the state's maximum security
prison at Walpole for 20 years.
   Jackson said he then told police he heard Bennett confess to the
shootings. Jackson said he went to police to recant his false
statements one day later, but eventually went back to saying
Bennett confessed.
   Boston police reached for comment today referred questions to
Suffolk County District Attorney Newman Flanagan. The telephone at
his office went unanswered early this morning; spokesman John
Julian told the Herald on Friday that Flanagan would have no
comment.
   Jackson said he told the same false story Nov. 21 before a grand
jury convened to hear evidence against Bennett, an ex-convict with
a record dating to 1964. He said he returned to the grand jury the
next day and recanted his testimony, even though his lawyer warned
him he could be charged with perjury.
   ``I wanted to do the right thing,'' Jackson told the Herald. ``I
didn't want this guy to go to jail. He was my friend's uncle and I
don't care what he did in the past. He did his time for that.''
   Another grand jury began hearing testimony Friday as it searches
for missing links in what police say was Stuart's plot to kill his
pregnant wife.
   Carol Stuart, 30, who was seven months pregnant, died hours
after the shooting, and her premature baby, Christopher, died 17
days later.
   Affidavits police released to The Associated Press on Friday
said Carol Stuart was shot in the left side of the head, which
would be consistent with the current police theory that Charles
Stuart, sitting in the driver's seat, shot his wife and himself.
   The affidavit was part of search-warrant applications filed in
Roxbury District Court by police investigating Bennett as a suspect
in the shootings.
   The affidavits also say that on Nov. 1, Bennett took it on his
own to flag down a patrol car and tell an officer he knew he was a
suspect but that he had been out of town at the time of the
shooting.
   Investigators learned of the apparent hoax when a younger
brother, Matthew Stuart, 23, told authorities Jan. 3 that he met
Charles at the murder scene and retrieved Mrs. Stuart's handbag,
which contained a gun and some personal items.
   Matthew Stuart has said he was not aware Mrs. Stuart was shot
when his brother passed him the bag. Prosecutors have declined to
say whether he or anyone else might face charges.

Kings Canyon and Sequoia parks came close to their best years ever.
   Yosemite attracted 3,429,619 visitors, a 3 percent increase from
1988, said Michael V. Finley, the park's new superintendent, who
said 70 percent of the visitors come from California, 20 percent
from abroad and the remaining 10 percent from other states.
   Both Kings Canyon and Sequoia national parks, south of Yosemite
in the central Sierra Nevada, topped 1 million visitors in 1989 for
the fourth straight year, the parks' statistics showed.

<HEAD>Accord Between Communists, Nationalists, Opposition Aims To End
Ethnic Strife</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bulgarian nationalists provisionally
agreed not to stage demonstrations against the granting of rights
to ethnic Turks after the Communist government guaranteed that
Bulgarian is still the official language.
   The guarantee came in a declaration Friday by representatives
from the nationalist, Communist and opposition camps, aimed at
defusing ethnic tensions that have swept Bulgaria for two weeks.
   The draft document upheld a Dec. 29 decision of the Communist
leadership restoring religious and other rights to minority ethnic
Turks. It also reaffirmed Bulgarian as the official language and
guaranteed this Balkan nation's ``sovereignty'' and ``territorial
integrity.''
   The provisional declaration was issued by a 19-member commission
of representatives on the last day of weeklong negotiations and
must still be submitted to Parliament for final approval.
Parliament meets Monday.
   Nationalist Mincho Minchev, spokesman for the Commission for the
Protection of National Interests, told reporters Friday the
declaration had his ``unreserved support.'' He said his movement
will not push for strikes or demonstrations over the weekend.
   Bulgarian protesters and strikers originally urged that the
decree be revoked pending a national referendum, and threatened
more unrest if their demands were not met.
   The Dec. 29 decision allowed ethnic Turks and Moslems here to
reassume their own names and practice their religion without
restrictions.
   It reversed an assimilation policy pursued by ousted Communist
leader Todor Zhivkov that forced ethnic Turks to assume Bulgarian
names and restricted their practicing Islam or using their native
language.
   An exodus to neighboring Turkey began last summer and about
300,000 of Bulgaria's estimated 1.5 million ethnic Turks still are
in that country.
   The forum was convened after thousands of nationalists converged
on the capital last week to protest changing the assimilation
policy. Many expressed concern that Bulgarian national unity would
be imperiled.
   Officials said a parliamentary commission will be formed to work
out a final national program based on the declaration. It will be
headed by Communist Party chief Petar Mladenov, who replaced
Zhivkov on Nov. 10.

<HEAD>Ranch Couple's Suit Against Jet Noise in Judge's Hands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA MYERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A couple who sued the Navy over the loss of
their cattle ranch have found it difficult to prove that the
thousands of jets screaming overhead are what caused their cows to
lose their enthusiasm for breeding.
   Don and Barbara Nonella sued the Navy for $8.7 million, claiming
flights out of the Fallon Naval Air Station ruined their business
and drove them off the land, which they couldn't sell and the Navy
wouldn't buy. Don Nonella now drives trucks out of Elko, in eastern
Nevada.
   The couple claims that increased jet training activity over
their ranch, 60 miles east of the naval air station, killed some of
their cattle and caused other cows to reproduce less.
   But the Navy's laywer, Lt. Mike Quinn, said Friday the couple
had failed to prove their claim.
   ``Things happen that only God can explain,'' Quinn said.
``Fluctuations in production are normal and to be expected. There's
no evidence to suggest that noise did it.''
   Bob Alexander, who represents the couple, said he had proved the
cattle were not diseased and were fed properly, ruling out
everything but stress from the ear-popping sonic booms caused by
the jets to explain why the cows were not reproducing.
   Closing arguments in the five-day trial ended Friday and it was
left in the hands of U.S. District Judge Bruce Thompson.
   Quinn said the Nonella's ranch lay beneath both a military
operations area and a supersonic flight range, and with more than
64,000 flights out of the naval air station each year in the late
1980s, it was logical there would be noise.
   ``The pilots must train somewhere and that somewhere is central
Nevada. Clearly our operation at times affects the people of
central Nevada. They bear part of the burden of making sure our
nation is prepared,'' he said.
   Alexander argued that the Nonellas would have had $1 million in
livestock sales each year from 1985 to 1988 if production hadn't
dropped off, but Quinn said the couple bought the ranch when cattle
prices were high and interest rates were low, then lost it as
livestock prices declined and interest rates rose.
   The couple said the conception rate of cows on their property
was more than 90 percent from 1979 when they bought the ranch but
fell to about 67 percent after 1984. They left the land in May 1988.
   James Cothern, an agricultural economics professor at the
University of California in Fresno and Davis, testified that a
computer analysis he performed showed the ranch was just
accumulating debt and would have failed no matter what.
   Nonella, 58, disputed that outside the courtroom.
   ``You don't run a ranch by computer, you run it by the seat of
your pants,'' he said, patting the bottom of his blue jeans.
   A government expert testified that cattle might become startled
and even run a bit when faster-than-sound military jets fly
overhead to set off sonic booms, but the animals aren't adversely
affected by the noise.
   James Bond, a retired noise expert for the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, said he conducted and reviewed several studies during
the 1960s and early 1970s that concluded animals quickly get used
to sonic booms and military overflights.
   ``Humans are definitely affected by sonic booms, but beef cattle
get used to it,'' Quinn said.

<HEAD>Witnesses Say Accused Woman Was `Cold, Emotioness' Toward
Daughters</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nurses said a woman who is charged with
killing one daughter and implicated in the death of another was
``cold and emotionless'' toward the infant girls but ``thrilled and
adoring'' of her son.
   Nurse Bernice Stupperich, testifying Friday in the trial of
Paula Marie Sims, recalled her ``cold, blank stare'' when she saw
newborn Heather. Mrs. Sims is accused of suffocating the 6-week-old
girl in April. Her first child, Loralei Marie, died after two weeks
of life in 1986.
   Mrs. Sims in both cases told authorities a masked gunman had
entered her home and snatched the babies, later discovered dead.
   She is charged with first-degree murder in the death of Heather,
and could face the death penalty if convicted. She faces trial
later for obstruction of justice and concealment of a homicide in
the death of Loralei in June 1986. No one has been charged in
Loralei's slaying.
   Defense attorney Donald Groshong spent hours Friday attacking
the testimony of Stephanie Werner Cook, who shared a hospital room
with Mrs. Sims in March when Heather was born.
   Mrs. Cook said Mrs. Sims described what she said was the 1986
kidnapping of Loralei to her, using details of the story Mrs. Sims
later told police when Heather disappeared.
   Madison County prosecutor Donald Weber said Mrs. Sims was groggy
from her Caesarean section and slipped up in describing Loralei's
death to Mrs. Cook, providing proof that Mrs. Sims already was
planning to kill Heather.
   Groshong accused Mrs. Cook of fabricating the story, implying
that she could not be believed because she was suffering
complications from her own childbirth.
   He also got Mrs. Cook to admit that Mrs. Sims was affectionate
toward Heather, often talking and singing to the baby and kissing
her.
   Mrs. Sims told police she was taking out the trash when a masked
gunman knocked her out and kidnapped Heather from their home in
Alton on April 29.
   Mrs. Sims said in 1986 that a masked gunman entered their rural
home in Brighton, a few miles north of Alton where the couple lived
at the time, and threatened to kill her before taking Loralei.
   Her husband, Robert Sims, 37, was at work on both occasions and
has not been charged in either case. He has custody of their
2-year-old son, Randy.
   ``When Randy was born, they were very excited,'' said Pam
Colley, a nurse at the Alton Memorial Hospital. ``They cried, they
were so happy. But their attitude toward Loralei's birth was
different. They were quiet and reserved.''
   Michael Graham, chief medical examiner in St. Louis, testified
Friday that he believed both girls died of ``homicidal violence''
and rejected theories proposed by Groshong that they could have
been accidents.
   The trial resumes Tuesday. It was moved to Peoria because of
pretrial publicity in the Alton area.

   Two Japanese men who fought for their
country in World War II and then with Communist guerrillas for 45
years in the jungles of Malaysia returned to Japan today, saying
they had looked forward to coming home the entire time.
   Shigeyuki Hashimoto, 71, and Kiyoaki Tanaka, 77, were greeted by
a group of about 20 relatives and friends bearing flowers and candy
at Tokyo's airport. It was their first time home since they left in
1944 to work in a wartime Japanese iron factory in Malaysia.
   They later joined Japan's Imperial Army and then took up arms
with the Communist Party of Malaya, now called Malaysia, when Japan
surrendered at the end of World War II in 1945. They wanted to help
the country gain independence from Britain, Japan's former enemy.
   ``We're Japanese, so we never forgot about Japan, even for one
day,'' Tanaka told a crowd of about 70 reporters at the airport.
``We looked forward greatly to returning to Japan, but as Japanese
we couldn't leave behind the people we were fighting alongside for
all those years until this opportunity.''
   The two appeared on Wednesday in Hat Yai, a town in southern
Thailand near the jungled Malaysian border where they and their
comrades in the Communist insurgency had fought for 45 years. Six
weeks ago, the insurgency was disbanded.
   ``We fought for a long time,'' Hashimoto said. ``We lost touch
with all of our old friends. Now only the two of us are still
alive.''
   Several of their relatives, including Tanaka's 51-year-old
daughter, had earlier flown to Thailand to meet them, and
accompanied the men back to Japan.
   Doctors in Bangkok had pronounced the two in satisfactory
condition, but Hashimoto, who suffers from high blood pressure,
traveled from the plane in a wheelchair with a nurse at his side.
   In a weak voice, Hashimoto explained his years away from home to
reporters and photographers who jammed a small airport conference
room.
   In 1957, when Malaysia, then called Malaya, gained independence
from Britain, ``we could have returned to Japan but it would have
required our surrender to the Malaya government and we chose not to
do so,'' he said.
   They decided to fight until the insurgency was over. ``Last
year, a peace accord was reached and we became finally free so we
could come back to Japan,'' Hashimoto said in a barely audible
voice.
   His account was interrupted by doctors who cautioned him against
further efforts to speak.
   ``I never doubted he was still alive but I did not hear from him
or about him for nearly 50 years so of course I was worried,'' said
Hashimoto's sister, Kikuko Ishiwatari, 74.
   Hashimoto, from Kanagawa prefecture, near Tokyo, and Tanaka were
scheduled to undergo tests at a hospital in Tokyo before returning
home. Tanaka, whose wife is still alive, is from Kumamoto
prefecture in the south.
   While in the jungle, the two men reportedly learned of the
enormous changes in Japan since World War II from a shortwave radio.
   British Commonwealth forces fought bloody battles with the
Communist insurgents during what was known as the 1948-1960
``emergency.'' Fighting continued on a lesser scale, but
Thai-Malaysian military strikes and a Thai amnesty badly hurt the
guerrilla movement in more recent years.
   In December, leaders of the party and Thai and Malaysian
government officials agreed to end the insurgency.

<TEXT>
   Three bombs exploded in the northern port
of Tripoli during the morning rush hour today, killing one person
and wounding 10, hours after an explosive charge went off near the
Saudi Arabian embassy in Beirut.
   Police said the Tripoli bombs detonated at five-minute
intervals, causing panic and traffic jams in Lebanon's
second-largest city, 50 miles north of the capital.
   The bombs, each containing an estimated 6{ pounds of TNT, were
planted on sidewalks in Tripoli's central business center.
   The explosions shattered windows within a two-mile radius,
leaving streets carpeted with glass shards, and damaged 14 cars,
police said.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said a 65-year-old electrical tools peddler was killed
in the first blast and that the injured were pedestrians.
   Tripoli's 850,000 inhabitants are predominantly Sunni Moslem.
The city has been policed by Syrian troops since dissident
Syrian-backed Palestinian factions drove out Palestine Liberation
Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat and his loyalists in 1983.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for today's
bombings. Few such attacks throughout Lebanon's 14-year-old civil
war have ever been claimed by the feuding factions.
   But Tripoli's Coordination Committee, which oversees the city's
day-to-day administrative affairs, blamed the bombings on the
forces of rebel Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun, who is opposed
to the Syrian presence in Lebanon.
   ``This is the way the outlaw general sees fit to carry on his
so-called war of liberation,'' the committee declared in a
statement.
   The bomb in Beirut exploded late Friday night under a car parked
80 yards from the abandoned Saudi Arabian Embassy in the Manara
residential district of the capital's Moslem sector, setting
several other cars afire.
   The embassy was closed in 1985 after it was ransacked and burned
by militants of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God,
protesting Saudi restrictions on the number of Iranians allowed to
make the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, Islam's holiest city.
   Christian army units and Syrian-backed Moslem militiamen clashed
with automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades before dawn
across the Green Line that divides Beirut into Moslem and Christian
sectors.
   Police said no casualties were reported in the one-hour flare-up
that underscored the deterioration of a civil war cease-fire called
by the Arab League Sept. 22.
   At least four people have been killed and 12 wounded in clashes
along the three-mile demarcation line in the last week.
   The hostilities reflect the deepening political crisis resulting
from Aoun's defiance of Syrian-backed President Elias Hrawi's
government, formed in November to try to end the civil war.
   Hrawi has dismissed Aoun as army commander and interim prime
minister. But the 54-year-old general is holding out with 20,000
men in the Christian enclave north of Beirut and refuses to quit
the presidential palace that he has occupied since last March.
   Aoun has rejected an Arab League peace plan that gives Moslems
an equal share of power with the Christians. He insists the plan
include a timetable for a complete Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon.
   The Syrian Army moved into Lebanon in 1976 under an Arab League
peacekeeping mandate. Aoun claims the Syrians abrogated that
mandate by openly siding with the Moslems against the Christians.

   The army took over Timisoara, the
cradle of Romania's revolution, after its interim leaders resigned
in apparent response to anti-Communist demonstrations, the state
news agency Rompres reported today.
   The army takeover apparently was an administrative measure and
does not mean the region is under martial law. The army's support
of anti-government demonstrators was crucial to the success of
Romania's revolution.
   On Friday, the nation's interim government outlawed the
Communist Party, whose four-decade rule ended with last month's
ouster of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   The developments followed massive street demonstrations in
Bucharest, Timisoara and Brasov to protest the participation of
former Communists in the leadership of the National Salvation
Front, which has been running Romania since Ceausescu's fall.
Thousands also demanded the death penalty for Ceausescu's hated
security police.
   In Timisoara, the provisional leader of the region stepped down
Friday night along with other members of the local National
Salvation Front Council, Rompres and the Yugoslav news agency
Tanjug reported.
   Maj. Gen. Gheorghe Popescu, the commander of the armed forces in
Timis county, whose chief city is Timisoara, said elections for a
new provisional leadership would be held within about a week,
Rompres reported.
   Popescu said that until then he would administer the county, the
scene of demonstrations Dec. 16-17 which spawned the popular revolt
that overthrew Ceausescu.
   Many Romanians attended church services Friday, declared a day
of mourning for the thousands of people who died in the army-backed
popular revolution that toppled Ceausescu.
   Interim President Ion Iliescu, himself a former Communist,
announced that this old party had been banned.
   ``The Romanian Communist Party is outlawed, considering that it
is against the national spirit,'' he told a crowd of 5,000 from the
window of a Bucharest building where the interim government has its
headquarters on Victoria Square.
   ``Victory, Victory!'' the crowded chanted at the news, broadcast
live over government radio and television.
   ``The Front is with us!'' they yelled, referring to the National
Salvation Front, the country's interim leadership.
   Iliescu did not say what the decision would mean for current
members of the party. Much of Romania's new leadership is composed
of Communists.
   The announcement came hours after the crowd shouted down Iliescu
and other leaders who tried to speak.
   Demonstrators yelled ``Down with communism! Kill the
Communists!'' They also burned a Romanian Communist flag and
Communist identification papers.
   ``Death to the Securitate!'' and ``Death for Death!'' the crowd
chanted, referring to the estimated 10,000 Romanians who died in
the clashes between security forces and the army during the
revolution.
   Iliescu told the crowd that a national referendum would be held
Jan. 28 on whether the death sentence should be reinstated for
members of the security police, who helped Ceausescu maintain his
24-year reign of terror.
   Ceausescu was executed with his wife, Elena, considered No. 2 in
the party, on Dec. 25, three days after they fled the palace in
Bucharest. The Front then abolished the death penalty and said
members of the security forces convicted by military tribunals
would be sentenced to lengthy prison terms.
   Romania's newly appointed General Prosecutor Gheorghe Robu told
Romanian TV Friday that all leading members of the Communist Party
were under arrest and their role in the Ceausescu regime was under
investigation. He said the trials would begin within 10 days.
   He said Ceausescu's children and brothers, arrested in the first
days of the revolt, also would be brought to trial soon.
   Friday's demonstration in Bucharest was the largest
anti-Communist protest since Ceausescu was ousted. Under his
iron-fisted rule, any form of protest or criticism of the
leadership or Communist Party was nipped in the bud.
   The Front comprises former party members, former dissidents and
intellectuals. It says its main purpose is to lead the country
until the elections, promised as early as April.
   Premier Petre Roman, addressing the crowd Friday, said ``It is
still a question if the ... Front will participate in the
elections.''
   Iliescu and other leaders went out to speak with the protesters
after attending a solemn service at the Patriarhie Orthodox
Cathedral in downtown Bucharest for victims of the uprising.
   The service was conducted by Patriarch Teoctist, spiritual
leader of the Romanian Orthodox Church. Under Ceausescu, religious
practices were greatly suppressed.

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Communist Party newspaper today criticized
the Communist-dominated coalition government for adopting reforms
too slowly and said the Communists should consider becoming an
opposition party.
   Only by quitting the coalition and acting as a opposition force,
the paper said, does the Communist Party stand a chance of
regaining its credibility and showing what it can accomplish in
East Germany.
   Ever since it was formed in December, the coalition government
led by Communist Premier Hans Modrow has been criticized by
opposition groups and allied political parties for its approach to
democratic reform.
   The coalition took power after a popular revolution ousted
hard-line Communist leader Erich Honecker, touching off a wave of
reforms that opened the Berlin Wall, lifted travel restrictions and
began an exodus to the West. The coalition will govern the nation
until multiparty elections can be held.
   On Friday, Modrow bowed to yet another opposition demand and
announced that his government will not create the internal security
agency before a democratically elected government takes office
after the May 6 elections.
   He also set a June 30 deadline for disbanding the Stasi, the old
state security agency, which the government said it would abolish
last month.
   Modrow had argued previously that a new security agency was
needed right away to guard against a purported threat by neo-Nazi
groups in East Germany.
   The opposition has threatened to hold general strikes in cities
around East Germany if the hated Stasi is not disbanded soon.
   Secret police agents and informers in all areas of life were the
Communists' preferred tool of repressing dissent and spying on
citizens during their 40 years of unchallenged rule before the
revolution late last year.
   Two of Modrow's coalition partners, the Liberal Democrats and
Christian Democrats, also expressed opposition on Friday to the
proposed election law, which would forbid campaign aid from abroad.
Heated debate on those issues is likely at talks on Monday between
the government and opposition.
   If Modrow's efforts at conciliation fail, workers could expand
warning strikes into major walkouts to show solidarity with the
opposition.
   In another problem for the government, tens of thousands of
frantic buyers jammed stores Friday after the coalition announced
limited price increases for Monday, and speculation was rampant
that further increases were imminent.
   A commentary today in Neues Deutschland, the official Communist
Party newspaper, suggested the Communists should consider becoming
an opposition force as one way to regain credibility.
   ``Maybe the SED-PDS (Communist Party) should march out of the
government coalition and into opposition ranks, with clear eyes and
an upright walk,'' the paper said. Opposition groups then could
``show what they can do.''
   Neues Deutschland criticized the Communist-dominated
government's efforts to use an alleged neo-Nazi threat as a
campaign issue and voiced concern about the slow dissolution of the
dreaded secret police.
   Berliner Zeitung, another Communist paper, suggested that East
Germany's drive toward democratic reform is slowing down.
   ``Nothing is changing anymore. Whoever exercised power before
still does so and makes sure he stays in power,'' the paper said.
   In another concession to the opposition, Modrow said late Friday
that he may name opposition members to deputy ministerial posts in
the government to oversee areas such as health or the environment.
His remarks, in an interview on West Germany's ZDF television
network, elaborated on a broadly worded offer Thursday to bring
reform groups into a government coalition.

<HEAD>Washington, Oregon Assess Flood Damage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A state of emergency was declared and federal officials today
planned to tour areas of Washington state hit hard by flooding and
high winds from three back-to-back Pacific storms.
   Oregon officials also continued assessing destruction from the
storms, which killed at least six people in the two states, closed
interstate highways and rail lines and drove hundreds from homes
damaged by toppling trees and flooding.
   Washington Gov. Booth Gardner on Friday declared a state of
emergency in 13 counties. Today's tour by Federal Emergency
Management Agency officials was planned in anticipation of
Gardner's asking President Bush to declare the counties a disaster
area and release federal aid.
   In Oregon, Gov. Neil Goldschmidt on Friday flew over two
northern coastal counties, Clatsop and Tillamook, that he had
declared emergency areas as the last of three storms rolled through
on Tuesday.
   He compared damage from the storms to that from the 1962
Columbus Day storm, which left 35 people dead and caused $170
million in damage.
   ``I think we just had another one,'' Goldschmidt said.
   ``We're no place close to a total estimate of damage, but we'll
know a lot more by the end of next week,'' Goldschmidt said. ``We'd
like to see that everybody who deserves assistance finds some way
to get it.''
   Insurance officials in Oregon said earlier this week they had
received damage claims totaling at least $12.5 million; Washington
officials estimated damage at more than $7 million.
   The American Red Cross was keeping disaster service centers open
during the weekend in all 13 Washington counties where Gardner
declared emergencies.
   ``The citizens of our state face millions of dollars in
damages,'' Gardner said. ``Many people's entire lives have been
turned upside down. We need access to every resource available to
make repairs and to return life to normal.''
   Many residents in the hardest-hit areas, along the Chehalis
River in Lewis, Thurston and Grays Harbor counties, were just
starting to return home Friday. An estimated 4,000 people in Lewis
County alone were affected by the flooding, with 400 evacuated.
   Kate Heimbach, state emergency management director, said early
damage estimates total at least $7.2 million.
   Interstate 5 was reopened Friday at Chehalis, about 85 miles
south of Seattle, after the river flooded the freeway Tuesday.
   The north-south Burlington Northern main line between Seattle
and Portland was reopened Friday after washing out Tuesday near
Vader, railroad spokesman Howard Kallio said.
   In Lewis County, about 175 people still remained in shelters or
motels Friday, state officials said. The airport remained flooded,
with 32 planes damaged, the state said.
   King County, where mudslides and water damaged homes, roads and
an apartment house, estimated its damage at more than $5 million.
Pierce County, where roads, bridges and more than 150 homes were
damaged, pegged its losses at $1.5 million.

<HEAD>Police Break Up Anti-Government Rallies in South Korea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Riot police fired tear gas to break up
anti-government rallies by hundreds of radical students at two
universities in the opposition stronghold of Kwangju city today, a
news agency said.
   About 700 radical students and dissidents fought police with
rocks and firebombs inside Chonam University in the southern city,
the Yonhap News Agency said. Police arrested six protesters in the
90-minute clash, the report said.
   The fighting began after 1,000 riot police, supported by two
armored vans with tear-gas launchers, marched into the campus to
break up the rally.
   The students shouted slogans calling for the punishment of
President Roh Tae-woo and his predecessor, Chun Doo-hwan. Radicals
have long held both responsible for a government crackdown on a
civil uprising in Kwangju in 1980 that left at least 200 people
dead and 1,500 wounded.
   Opposition parties have been powerful in Kwangju ever since, but
radical students who have repeatedly staged anti-demonstrations
since South Korea adopted democratic reforms in 1988 do not enjoy
much popular support.
   A police helicopter hovered overhead today as riot police fired
tear gas and swept through the sprawling campus to stop the
protest, the agency said.
   No injuries were immediately reported.
   The clash followed a 30-minute demonstration at nearby Chosun
University earlier in the day. Police fired tear gas to disperse
200 radical students occupying a rail crossing in front of their
school, Yonhap said. The clash forced a passenger train to screech
to a halt.
   No injuries or arrests were immediately reported.
   The protesters at Chonam denounced a recent political compromise
between the governing and opposition political parties to end a
long dispute over investigations into alleged corruption during the
autocratic Chun regime.
   Under the Dec. 15 compromise, Chun testified in parliament on
alleged misdeeds during his seven-year rule, which ended in 1988.
The testimony on Dec. 31 was marred by repeated shouting matches
and a melee among legislators.
   Roh was also criticized today because of his close ties with
Chun. Roh helped Chun seize power with military backing in 1980.

<HEAD>Three Killed in West Belfast Shootout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three men who allegedly were
holding up a betting shop were shot to death by soldiers in
plainclothes today in West Belfast, police said.
   A fourth man, apparently a passerby, was injured by gunfire, the
Royal Ulster Constabulary said.
   Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the legal political wing of
the Irish Republican Army, accused the security forces of ``the
cold blooded and savage murder of three young men.''
   However, Sinn Fein denied that any of the three dead men were
members of the IRA. They were not immediately identified.
   The constabulary issued a statement saying that two soldiers who
were on duty but not in uniform interrupted a robbery at a betting
shop on the Falls Road in West Belfast.
   ``Shots were fired and three persons were killed _ one man in a
car and the others, both of whom had been hooded, outside a stolen
vehicle. A fourth person, believed to be a passerby, was injured.''
   Police said the car used by the suspects had been stolen from a
hospital parking lot the previous night.
   A spokesman for the constabulary, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said he did not know who initiated the shooting.
   He also declined to comment on reports in Belfast that the
soldiers were members of the elite Special Air Service unit of the
British army. Such reports, he said, were ``rumor and speculation.''
   A man interviewed by Independent Television News, who claimed to
have witnessed the shooting, said the soldiers fired at two men as
they lay wounded on the sidewalk. The man was not identified in the
ITN report.
   Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, quoted a
witness as saying: ``Two fellows with rifles or machine guns _ they
were unhooded and had civilian clothes _ shot these two fellows who
were hooded.''
   He said the third victim was sitting, without a hood, in the
nearby car.
   ``When I looked into the car he was slumped over on to the
passenger side. All three were definitely dead,'' said the man, who
declined to give his name.

   Lithuanian Communists today rejected President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's appeal to restore ties they severed with Moscow and

   Elsewhere, more scattered clashes were reported today in the
troubled southern Caucasus region, which has been racked by

   The recovery of a huge science lab
by space shuttle Columbia will help engineers design spaceships of
the future, the shuttle's commander said today.
   Astronaut Dan Brandenstein said all the various types of
materials that have been exposed to space on the Long Duration
Exposure Facility for more than five years ``will now be studied
and that will give us the capability to design better and more
durable spacecraft and space stations.''
   Brandenstein and his four crew members discussed their flight in
a 20-minute news conference from their distant orbit, answering
questions beamed up from reporters at the Johnson Space Center in
Houston.
   Mission specialist Bonnie Dunbar, who snared LDEF Friday with
the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm, said that although some of the
experiments were beaten up by the long exposure to micrometeoroids
and other space debris, they will serve as invaluable research
tools.
   ``It was the intent of this payload to find out which materials
we should be building space stations and spacecraft out of,'' she
said.
   Mission specialist David Low said the astronauts planned to
spend the final days of the flight before their planned landing
next Friday working on experiments.
   ``This is the second longest space shuttle mission, and we can
do some good materials sciences work and also get some good medical
data,'' he said.
   Pilot Jim Wetherbee said as a rookie space flier it took him a
couple of days to get used to weightlessness. He and the two other
first-time space travelers, Low and Marsha Ivins, sometimes bumped
into one another until they got acclimated.
   ``It's pretty neat to be floating around up here,'' Ivins
commented.
   The space travelers and ground controllers remained on an
emotional high today after the retrieval of the satellite, with
Mission Control waking the crew with its version of ``Hello Dolly.''
   ``Hello, LDEF, it's so nice to have you back where you belong .
.. You're looking swell, LDEF, we can tell, LDEF...''
   ``Your music this morning is courtesy of the LDEF project who
are obviously very happy,'' the control center told the astronauts.
   ``We enjoyed doing it and are equally happy,'' Brandenstein
responded.
   With the most dramatic part of the trip behind them, the
astronauts settled in for six days of experiments, concentrating on
materials processing and tests on how well the human body adapts to
weightless space.
   The planned 10-day mission, which began Tuesday, is the second
longest in 33 shuttle flights and is a stepping stone to even
longer shuttle missions and to months-long trips aboard space
station Freedom in the mid-1990s.
   Columbia is to return to Earth Friday, with a landing scheduled
for 2:57 a.m. PST at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
   ``The rendezvous just went famously,'' flight director Al
Pennington said Friday. ``It looks like we really have a valuable
piece of science in our grasp.''
   Brandenstein and Wetherbee steered the shuttle so close to
orbiting space lab that Dunbar only had to move the 50-foot
mechanical arm about 2 feet to grasp a grappling device on the
satellite, Pennington said.
   After Dunbar secured the wiry fingers of the robot arm to the
orbiting space lab, she turned the satellite slowly above the cargo
bay so Ivins and Low could photograph it extensively for about four
hours before it was secured in the cargo bay for the trip home.
   Bill Kinard, NASA's chief scientist for the LDEF project, said
he was pleased with the initial results of the rescue mission.
   ``It was a beautiful sight,'' Kinard said after the satellite
was stored. ``The views were very much as we expected. We expected
to see some damage, particularly on the leading edge of LDEF.
Essentially, it looked very much as we expected. We're delighted.''
   The astronauts earlier reported that the nearly six-year stay in
the harsh space environment has taken its toll on several of the 57
experiments in trays attached to LDEF's multisided exterior.
   ``Some pretty interesting things on the space end. Some of the
panels ... that had aluminum foil over look like they've almost
exploded. I mean they're just peeled back like a sardine can,''
Brandenstein said.
   The satellite, the size of a small school bus, was being pulled
to Earth by atmospheric drag. If the astronauts had not retrieved
it, trackers estimated it would have plunged to a fiery death in
the atmosphere about March 9, its experiments lost forever.
   Scientists are eager to learn how the various experiments and
materials have withstood the stay in space. This will help them
design the space station Freedom and other future long-duration
spacecraft.
   The retrieval ended a celestial chase that began with liftoff
Tuesday. Columbia covered 1.3 million miles and circled the globe
50 times before making the pickup.
   Other orbiting satellites have been recovered before by
astronauts, but none as big as LDEF.

   An Arab teen-ager today fatally stabbed a
Palestinian man accused of collaborating with Israeli authorities,
news reports said.
   Also today, Israeli soldiers shot and wounded at least 10
Palestinians during stone-throwing street protests in the occupied
Gaza Strip.
   Hospital officials said the body of Naim Mohamad Handukah, 50,
was brought to Shifa Hospital in Gaza City with multiple stab
wounds in the chest.
   Arab reports said Handukah was in his taxi company's office in
the affluent Rimal neighborhood when a 16-year-old broke in and
attacked him with a dagger.
   The army confirmed the death and said it was being investigated.
   Israel radio said Handukah was accused of collaborating with
Israeli authorities and that his assailant was in police custody.
   Handukah's death brought to 170 the number of Palestinians
killed by fellow Arabs for allegedly collaborating with Israeli
officials during the 2-year-long Palestinian uprising against
Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.
   At least 646 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers
or civilians during the uprising, and 43 Israelis also have been
slain.
   Dozens of Palestinians blocked the main commercial Omar
El-Mukhtar street in Gaza City today and hurled rocks at Israeli
soldiers manning three nearby observation posts, Arab reporters and
hospital officials said.
   The soldiers opened fire, wounding four Palestinians, including
a 15-year-old youth in the right knee, hospital officials said. At
least four Palestinians were wounded in a similar clash in Rafah,
and soldiers shot and wounded two Palestinians in Khan Yunis,
hospital officials said.
   The army said it was checking the reports.

button that closed the hatches of the giant Ataturk Dam. The action
will allow engineers to fill a reservoir to a height of 396 feet
and build a concrete plug for a diversion channel as part of the
construction project.
   During the one-month stoppage, Syria and Iraq will get less
water from the tributaries of the Euphrates, the river that has
been the lifeblood throughout history for the area that once formed
ancient Mesopotamia.
   The ceremony today was a moment of pride and accomplishment for
Turkey, which views the Southeast Anatolia project to build more
than a dozen dams as the key to the economic development of the
backward region.
   But the event is considered a cause for worry for Iraq and
Syria, which are highly dependent on the waters of the 1,460-mile
Euphrates River. It was the lifeblood of ancient Mesopotamia, a
part of modern-day Iraq.
   For one month, Syria and Iraq will receive about one-fourth of
the water they normally get from the tributaries of the Euphrates.
   Turkey said that since November, it has released extra water to
Syria and Iraq to allow them to store water in reservoirs for use
during the cutoff.
   Syria has made no statement on the water stoppage. Iraq sent its
deputy foreign minister, Nizar Hamdoun, to Turkey last month to ask
for a stoppage of two weeks instead of the planned one month.
   Hamdoun said the cutoff would not provoke a major crisis in
Iraqi agriculture, but it would cause damage in some areas.
   Iraqi irrigation and agriculture officials said today that First
Undersecretary Abdul Sattar Salman will head a high-level
delegation to the Turkish capital to discuss problems arising from
cutting the Euphrates flow.
   Turkey on Monday sent a foreign ministry delegation to tour
Iraq, Syria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia to deliver a message that it
does not intend to use its control of the rivers for political
leverage.
   Syria is more dependent on the river, because Iraq has the
Tigris River in its territory. But Syria is in a position to divert
more of the Euphrates River water to its own reservoirs and allow
just a trickle to Iraq.
   ``This is a problem they will have to solve among themselves,''
said a Turkish official who asked for anonymity.
   Ever since it started building dams on the Euphrates in the
1960s, Turkey has periodically reassured its neighbors they would
all share the water.
   Once the project of 15 dams and 18 hydroelectric power plants is
completed, however, Turkey will have a stranglehold on the waters
of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers.
   The first generating unit of the Ataturk Dam is to start
production in May 1991. The dam, about 100 miles from the Syrian
border near Sanliursa, is the centerpiece of the massive Southeast
Anatolia project, designed to harness the waters of both Euphrates
and Tigris with a chain of dams and hydroelectric power plants.
   When completed in 2006, the project will produce 22 billion
kilowatt hours of electricity annually and irrigate an area of 4
million acres. This would double the yield in many crops in Turkey,
producing $5 billion in surplus food, officials say.

   Le Van Lich took a drag from his bamboo
pipe and surveyed the grim one-room home he has shared with 17
other people since being forcibly repatriated from Hong Kong a
month ago.
   A forlorn expression his constant companion, and his 2-year-old
daughter sitting on his lap, Lich summed up his new life: ``I don't
know about the future, I only know the fact before my eyes _ I
don't have enough to eat.''
   Luck has been going against Lich since he and his family set
sail for Hong Kong in their 43-foot wooden boat to escape grinding
poverty.
   They completed the 500-mile trip to the British colony on June
20, five days after Hong Kong authorities announced that newly
arriving Vietnamese boat people would be considered illegal
immigrants unless they could prove they faced persecution in their
Communist homeland.
   That doomed Lich's chances of starting a new life in the West,
for as he acknowledged, ``I have nothing to do with politics. I
just left Vietnam for economic reasons.''
   The 37-year-old fisherman and 11 other members of his family,
including his wife and five children, were among the first group of
51 boat people to be sent back home against their will in the
pre-dawn hours of Dec. 12. Another 36,000 Vietnamese in Hong Kong
camps are waiting to see if they will face a similar fate.
   The forced repatriation triggered an international outcry, in
part because of concern that the boat people would be punished upon
their return home.
   Haiphong officials insist that Lich and other returnees need not
worry. Timothy Raison, a British parliamentarian who visited 37 of
the forcibly returned boat people last week, said he found no sign
of persecution.
   ``I think we have been forgiven by the Vietnamese government,''
said Le Van Tuoi, another fisherman forced back on the same
chartered flight as Lich.
   Lich agreed that local authorities have been friendly and that
he does not fear punishment.
   But he sais, ``Now I have another worry. We don't have money; we
don't have anything to live on. We lost our fishing boat and our
fishing equipment.''
   The boat that had been home and livelihood for three generations
of Lich's family was left behind in Hong Kong. Since returning to
Vietnam, they have had to live in a friends' tiny home tucked
inside a maze of alleys in this gritty northern port city.
   A large cabinet and two beds are the only furniture; a makeshift
altar with a faded picture of Jesus rests on a rickety wooden loft.
Clothes hang to dry from three lines strung across the room, and
stashed in a corner are the red, white and blue bags that hold
Lich's meager family possessions.
   Britain and Hong Kong have promised to pay Vietnam about $600 to
help reintegrate each repatriated boat person, but it is unclear
how much cash each returnee will get.
   ``I'm waiting for the money from the Hong Kong government ... so
I can buy a boat or a house,'' Lich said. ``The government also
promised us when we arrived at the airport that it would help us
build a house.''
   Adults were given $30 and children $15 when they left Hong Kong,
although Lich claimed they were promised more.
   The fishermen will need far more money to build or buy a boat
equipped with nets, which Raison said could cost up to $10,000.
   In the meantime, Lich is frustrated with being idle and remains
bitter at the Hong Kong and British governments for puncturing his
dream of a better life.
   He remembered the three Hong Kong detention centers where he was
imprisoned for nearly 18 months _ the crowded conditions, stifling
boredom and what he described as inadequate food. He said his
father died of lung cancer while languishing in the camps.
   Also fresh in his mind was the pre-dawn swoop by Hong Kong
security forces in riot gear who whisked Lich and his family to the
airport for the flight back to Hanoi. ``They didn't beat us, but
they pushed and dragged us,'' he said.
   Added Lich, his sorrow unwavering: ``I'm angry, and I regret I
ever left for Hong Kong.''

<HEAD>North Korea Proposes Talks With South on Free Travel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL SHIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist North Korea on Saturday
proposed talks with South Korea on allowing free travel between the
rival countries. South Korea rejected the idea.
   The proposal was made in letters sent to the border village of
Panmunjom. They were delivered to President Roh Tae-woo, Prime
Minister Kang Young-hoon and three main opposition leaders _ Kim
Dae-jung, Kim Young-sam and Kim Jong-pil.
   According to South Korean officials, North Korea repeated in the
letters a proposal by its leader, Kim Il Sung, that the two Koreas
hold ``top-level political talks'' to discuss free travel on the
Korean peninsula.
   They quoted the letters as saying in part, ``As a first step
toward opening the gate of unification, the concrete wall set up on
the southern side of the border should be torn down.''
   ``If the southern side destroys the concrete wall, we will
immediately remove a barbed wire fence on our side that marks the
border line,'' they futher quoted the letters as saying.
   In a New Year's speech, the North Korean ruler called on South
Korea to tear down a concrete border wall along the 155-mile-long
border to ensure free travel as a first step toward unifying the
divided peninsula.
   Choi Byong-bo, a spokesman for the South Korean government's
National Unification Board, noted that North Korea has repeated
similar proposals on numerous occasions since its Communist
government was set up in 1948. The peninsula was divided at the end
of World War II in 1945.
   Choi said southern leaders would not attend the proposed talks.
   In a nationally televised news conference last week, Roh
proposed a face-to-face meeting with his North Korean counterpart
to discuss possible free travel and ways to ease friction on the
peninsula.
   He suggested the conclusion of a free travel and communication
agreement between the two Koreas. North Korea rejected both
proposals.
   South Korean officials accuse North Korea of trying to create
the ``false'' impression that there is a barrier along the border
like the Berlin Wall.
   ``There simply is no such wall along the border,'' Defense
Ministry spokesman Brig. Gen. Kim Ji-woo said.
   ``'The North's false propaganda shows how they are embarrassed
in the midst of sweeping changes in East Europe,'' the ministry
spokesman said.
   Ministry officials said there are tank traps along some portions
of the border that were used by North Korea when it invaded the
South in 1950 to start the Korean War.

<HEAD>High Court Ruling Reopens Wounds for Many in Civil Rights
Community</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Supreme Court ruling last week in a
protracted racial desegregation dispute from Yonkers, N.Y.,
reopened not-so-old wounds for many in the civil rights community.
   The decision, while perhaps more symbolic than substantive, is a
painful reminder for civil rights leaders that the most likely
champion of their aspirations now is Congress, not the high court.
   The civil rights movement's longstanding reliance on the court
as an ally ended with a series of 1989 rulings that curtailed
affirmative action, made it tougher to prove employment bias and
restricted remedies for on-the-job racial harassment.
   The clear signal was that a court made more conservative by
appointees of former President Reagan had swung the balance in
civil rights lawsuits in favor of defendants and the white majority.
   Civil rights leaders still are smarting over those rulings, and
are asking Congress for new laws to overcome them.
   The Yonkers decision limited judges' power to crack down on
civil rights violations.
   The 5-4 ruling said a judge improperly fined Yonkers City
Council members but acted within his authority in imposing coercive
fines against the city for reneging on its agreement to desegregate
housing.
   ``The message is perhaps not a powerful one, but a negative
one,'' said Kerry Scanlon of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. ``Judges
are going to be looking over their shoulder, wondering if they are
going too far'' in ordering remedies for past civil rights
violations.
   Steven Shapiro of the American Civil Liberties Union said he is
happy that last week's decision, authored by Chief Justice William
H. Rehnquist, was not written more broadly to pull in the judicial
reins even more tightly.
   ``There are indications that suggest Rehnquist would have liked
to go further but he couldn't hold the majority if he did,''
Shapiro said.
   Shapiro declined to speculate about which court members might
have refused to join a broader ruling. But he said, ``Obviously,
Justice (Sandra Day) O'Connor has been a swing vote in this area.''
   Barbara Arnwine, executive director of the Lawyers Committee for
Civil Rights Under Law, sees some positive signs in the Yonkers
decision.
   ``The court has yet to take a plunge against strong,
race-conscious, remedial measures,'' she said.
   Ms. Arnwine said last week's ruling may bode well for civil
rights forces in a Kansas City, Mo., case now awaiting decision by
the justices.
   In it, a federal trial judge ordered the city's school district
to raise property taxes to help pay for racially desegregating
public schools. The high court's decision is expected by July.
   Before ending its current term, the court also is expected to
decide what could be its most significant civil rights case of the
year: judging the validity of special preferences the federal
government gives to women and minority members seeking licenses for
radio and television stations.
   The court last year limited similar affirmative action efforts
by state and local governments, ruling that a public works
set-aside program in Richmond, Va., violated the rights of whites.
   The current case presents the court with programs initiated by
the federal government, and its ruling could affect federal
affirmative action beyond the broadcasting industry.
   Compared with last year, however, the court's docket of civil
rights cases is light.
   ``Maybe we all can be thankful this isn't a busy year for the
court in this area,'' said Scanlon of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.
   Others may share the opinion of one dejected civil rights
attorney who, when asked last July what future setbacks loomed,
replied, ``What's left?''

<HEAD>Opposition Charges Bhutto Pregnancy Leaves Country Without Leader</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY GANNON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opponents of Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto have turned her pregnancy into a political weapon,
complaining that the country will be left without leadership while
Ms. Bhutto takes maternity leave.
   The baby, Ms. Bhutto's second, is expected to be born before
Jan. 20. Some of the strongest objections have come from another
woman, Abida Hussein, an independent member in the National
Assembly.
   ``The feminist in me has been really outraged over this
pregnancy. It was wrong, irresponsible and poses very serious
difficulties for our nation,'' said Ms. Hussein, a leading opponent
of the Bhutto government.
   ``It's a very extreme situation. We will have no chief executive
officer for a few weeks,'' she alleged. ``The constitution doesn't
provide for maternity leave.''
   Nasir Aslam Zahid, a constitutional expert in Pakistan's law,
justice and parliamentary affairs ministry, said official
Parliamentary rules cover Ms. Bhutto's absence, regardless of the
reason.
   The laws provide for a senior minister, appointed by the prime
minister, to head the Cabinet in her absence.
   In the past, particularly during her frequent travels abroad,
Ms. Bhutto left her mother and National Assembly member, Nusrat
Bhutto, in charge.
   The elder Bhutto also shares the chairmanship of the ruling
left-of-center Pakistan People's Party with her daughter.
   ``No doubt she will have Mom look after the shop while she's
away,'' said Ms. Hussein, a hint of sarcasm in her voice. ``(But)
running a nation is not a family concern.''
   Ms. Bhutto's detractors criticize the ruling party as a family
dynasty started in 1967 by her father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. He was
prime minsiter from 1970 to 1977, when he was overthrown by
President Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq in a coup.
   Amina Piracha, a lawyer and member of Bhutto's party, dismissed
opposition complaints and said she did not expect the 36-year-old
prime minister to be out of office for long.
   ``(Until now) she hasn't taken even one day of leave because of
her pregnancy,'' she said.
   Ms. Bhutto's first child, Bilawal, was born less than a month
before the November 1988 elections that gave her left-leaning party
the largest bloc of votes.
   She was campaigning the day before the birth and returned to the
campaign trail less than a week later.
   When Ms. Bhutto assumed office Dec. 2, 1988, becoming the first
woman to leader a modern Moslem nation and, at 35, was the youngest
world leader.
   Islamic fundamentalists condemned her leadership, saying a
woman's rule ran contrary to the tenets of Islam.
   Ms. Piracha said Ms. Bhutto's leadership has debunked claims
that having children puts serious limits on female ambitions.
   ``She has shown to the world that it is not a constraint,'' said
Ms. Piracha. ``She has in fact been able to conduct herself with
such dignity.''
   Ms. Hussein dismissed speculation that Ms. Bhutto's often
hostile opposition will move against the government during her
absence.
   Last November, Ms. Bhutto's government narrowly survived a
no-confidence motion. The opposition, lead by an alliance of
right-wing, centrist and Islamic fundamentalist parties, has
several times vowed to unseat the Bhutto government.

<TEXT>
   On a June day in 1985, Marine Lt. Col. Oliver
L. North, then managing director of the U.S. drive to aid the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels, boarded a yacht anchored off the Pacific
coast of Panama for a secret meeting with the country's military
strongman, Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   North needed Noriega's permission to use Panamanian military
bases and personnel to train Contra soldiers in their fight against
Nicaragua's Sandinista government.
   Noriega enthusiastically joined in the effort to help the
Contras, apparently betting that his cooperation would encourage
U.S. officials to turn a blind eye to evidence that he was involved
in narcotics trafficking, money laundering and gun running.
   The ousted Panamanian leader now claims that the U.S. began its
campaign to remove him only after he refused to allow Panama to be
used as a launching pad for Contra attacks against Nicaragua.
   North, who at that time was a White House aide, held at least
two further meetings with Noriega, a strand in a web of high level
U.S. government contacts with the Panamanian ruler that included
sessions with Vice President George Bush, CIA Director William
Casey and Vice Adm. John Poindexter, the Reagan administration's
national security adviser.
   Analyzing these meetings, investigators for a Senate Foreign
Affairs subcommittee on narcotics concluded last year that Noriega
was following a divide-and-conquer strategy in his relations with
the United States.
   Noriega eventually offered to provide military training and
weapons for the Contras and also to infiltrate Panamanian troops
inside Nicaragua to sabotage key facilities and assassinate
Sandinista leaders.
   ``Noriega recognized that so long as he helped the United States
with its highest diplomatic priorities ... the United States would
have to overlook activities of his that affected lesser U.S.
priorities,'' the Democratic-led panel said.
   ``In the mid-1980s, this meant that our government did nothing
regarding Noriega's drug business and substantial criminal
involvement because the first priority was the Contra war,'' it
said.
   Noriega, now awaiting trial in Miami on narcotics charges after
his ouster from power in a U.S. invasion last month, long has said
he holds information highly embarrassing to key U.S. officials,
information stemming in part from his face-to-face conversations
with them.
   Noriega's lawyers say they will ask the government to turn over
many sensitive documents bearing on Noriega's relationship with
U.S. officials, documents which he contends will show the United
States was aware of his narcotics activities for many years and
chose to ignore them.
   The Senate subcommittee, headed by Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.,
sought many of the same documents but never succeeded in obtaining
them from government agencies. Earlier, the congressional
Iran-Contra committees also sought to trace Noriega's
relationships, especially with North and the Contras.
   Jose Blandon, a former Panamanian intelligence officer who was
fired by Noriega as Panama's counsel-general in New York City, told
the Senate investigators that when Noriega and North held their
first shipboard meeting, North was looking for ways to circumvent
the congressional ban on U.S. aid to the Contras.
   Blandon testified that the meeting led to an agreement with
Noriega in which up to 250 Contra soldiers received training at two
Panamanian military bases, with Contra leaders being given
permission to enter and leave Panama freely.
   At a second meeting in October 1985 in Noriega's office in
Panama City, the general asked for a favor in return, saying Panama
needed economic help to deal with more than $3 billion in foreign
debt.
   Blandon told reporters Panama received some $200 million in U.S.
and international bank loans during the next year.
   In August 1986, Noriega, through an intermediary, upped the ante
with an explosive offer.
   Panamanian troops would infiltrate Nicaragua and assassinate top
Sandinista leaders ``in exchange for a promise to help clean up
Noriega's image and a commitment to lift the ban on military sales
to the Panamanian defense forces,'' according to documents made
public at North's Iran-Contra trial.
   According to the documents, Poindexter responded that the
administration was barred by law from involvement in
assassinations, ``but Panamanian assistance with sabotage would be
another story.''
   North and Noriega met in London in late September 1986 and
Noriega agreed ``to take immediate actions against the Sandinistas
and offered a list of priorities, including an oil refinery, an
airport and the Puerto Sandino off-load facility.''
   The committee found no evidence the sabotage plan was carried
out.
   Casey met with Noriega in Panama in November 1985 and, according
to the Senate subcommittee report, failed to raise the issue of
Noriega's involvement with narcotics.
   The panel said Casey later justified his failure to raise the
issue with Noriega, with whom the CIA had had a close working
relationship for nearly two decades, because Noriega was providing
valuable support for U.S. policies in Central America, especially
in Nicaragua.
   The drug issue never came up in a December 1985 meeting between
Noriega and Poindexter, the committee said.
   Noriega and Bush first met in 1976 when Bush headed the CIA and
Noriega led the Panamanian intelligence service. They met again in
1983 in Panama when Bush was vice president.
   Last February, after Noriega was indicted, he alleged that
Poindexter had told Panamanian officials in 1985 that the United
States planned to invade Nicaragua.
   Bush rejected that as ``pure fabrication and a lie.''
   Noriega also alleged that immediately before the U.S. invasion
of Grenada in 1983 Bush called him and asked him to assure Cuban
President Fidel Castro that Cuban soldiers and workers in Grenada
were not a target of the attack.
   That claim also was labeled ``a total fabrication'' by Bush.
   Noriega said last year that his troubles with the United States
began only after he balked at escalating U.S. requests to aid the
Contras.
   In a speech last February, shortly after his indictment, Noriega
said that Poindexter warned him to ``expect the consequences'' if
he refused to cooperate further on Central America.
   Noriega said he considered the indictment to be ``the
consequences.''
   He gave another account of his encounter with Poindexter to Saul
Landau, a senior fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies, a
Washington think tank.
   In an article prepared for the February-March issue of Mother
Jones Magazine, Landau said Noriega told him he had refused to
allow Panama to be used as ``a launching pad'' for the Contras.
   ``Poindexter grew quite indignant, right in my office,'' Landau
quoted Noriega as saying. ``He took out his pipe and banged it on
the table. I'm not sure if he broke it. After that incident, the
United States began its campaign to remove me.''

<HEAD>Officials Play It Down, But NBC Miniseries Raises Hackles In
Mexico</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Although it finished second in the Nielsen
ratings and lost to a television movie on Rock Hudson, NBC's ``Drug
Wars'' was a hit, of sorts, in Mexico.
   The government and national media protested last week's series,
and one sensationalist newspaper even printed speculation that the
subject of the movie _ a slain U.S. drug agent _ was alive and well
in La Jolla, Calif.
   Mexican officials had been anticipating the series nervously for
months, well aware that the killing of Drug Enforcement
Administration agent Enrique Camarena in 1985 threw U.S.-Mexico
relations into a crisis.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's priority has been to get
his nation's stagnant economy moving again. He has tried hard to
neutralize drug trafficking as an irritant to U.S.-Mexico relations
in order to focus on improving trade and reducing the foreign debt.
   ``Drug Wars'' was unforgiving in its portrayal of a corrupt
legal system that frustrated enforcement and covered up the
Camarena killing, and officials feared it would damage Salinas'
efforts to change Mexico's image.
   Most defensive was Attorney General Enrique Alvarez del
Castillo, who was governor of Jalisco state when Caramena was
kidnapped in the state capital of Guadalajara. He was criticized
for tolerating official corruption and sitting on his hands as
major drug dealers operated freely.
   Posted behind six tons of seized cocaine at a news conference in
October, the attorney general denied Mexico's anti-drug efforts
were part of a ``show'' for the gringos and threatened to sue if
``Drug Wars'' contained any slander.
   However, Javier Coello Trejo, the assistant attorney general in
charge of narcotics enforcement, said the series would have no
effect.
   ``Our image is bad, it's not right, but there have been deeds
that can't be mistaken. What is changing our image is the vigor
with which our president is fighting the problem,'' he told The
Associated Press.
   Like other NBC programs, the Sunday-to-Tuesday series appeared
in English on Mexico City cable systems, along with public service
spots trumpeting Salinas administration achievements in the drug
war.
   U.S. officials are virtually unanimous in saying that Mexico has
indeed made progress, and DEA administrator John Lawn said so on an
NBC News segment that followed the first broadcast last Sunday
night.
   Nevertheless, the Mexican government protested the series and
some of the comments that followed as unfair ``and perhaps in bad
faith,'' something NBC vigorously denied.
   Mexican officials pointed out that 34 tons of cocaine has been
seized in the 13 months since Salinas took office, more than in the
10 previous years put together. Mexican sources also said that
fully 30 percent of the Mexican anti-narcotics force as it existed
at the end of 1988 is now in prison.
   And in December, Rafael Caro Quintero and Ernesto Fonseca
Carrillo were sentenced to 40 years in prison without parole for
the killing of Camarena, whose bullet-riddled body was found nearly
a month after his kidnap.
   With distraction provided by the visit of Spanish King Juan
Carlos to Mexico, the president held his tongue during the TV
series, but other Mexicans in politics and the media were not so
sanguine.
   Opposition politicians said the administration should vigorously
protest it as an insult to Mexico and Mexican law enforcement.
   The government wire service distributed, and the government
newspaper El Nacional printed, a story that raked up old and
discredited accusations that Camarena was somehow in league with
the drug traffickers who killed him.
   ``This is just a sort of desperate and rather pathetic effort to
try to appease the Mexican public to try to take the heat off in
Mexico,'' said Elaine Shannon, author of ``Desperados,'' the book
on which the miniseries was based.
   El Nacional also printed a story that attacked the credibility
of the U.S. press, summarizing allegations that reporters had
smoked marijuana in the White House during the Carter
administration.
   Perhaps the most improbable article appeared under banner
headlines in the sensationalist afternoon edition of El Sol de
Mexico, seriously discussing speculation that Camarena was alive
and living in La Jolla, Calif.
   Some Mexican officials asked if ``Drug Wars'' was part of a U.S.
plot to denigrate Mexico, noting comments made on the news segments
that seemed to equate Panama and Mexico.
   However, Salinas administration officials, although critical of
the program's content, said it was unlikely to have any long-term
effect.
   ``Now more than ever the relationship between our nations is
friendly, particularly among those dedicated to fighting drug
trafficking,'' said Fernando Arias, chief spokesman for attorney
general Alvarez.
   He, like other officials, thought the American public was
sophisticated enough to recognize a Hollywood production when they
saw it.
   ``It is part of the ratings wars, not the drug wars,'' said
Agustin Barrios Gomez, Mexico's consul general in New York.
   NBC said the series won an average 15.3 A.C. Nielsen Co. rating,
representing more than 14 million households. It finished second
overall in its time period. On Monday, the program's second night,
it finished third to an ABC television movie on Rock Hudson and a
lineup of CBS comedies.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
announced today that he is willing to accept a multiparty political
system in the Soviet Union, where the Communist Party he leads has
ruled for 72 years.
   His pledge came at the conclusion of a three-day visit to the
restive Baltic republic of Lithuania aimed at persuading local
Communists to restore the ties they severed with Moscow. But top
party members rejected his appeal, saying union with the national
party ``would mean death'' for theirs.
   In previous public appearances, Gorbachev had ruled out
permitting the existence of other parties, which is already a
political fact of life in Lithuania since the local legislature
voted last year to revoke the Communists' constitutional guarantee
of power.
   But Gorbachev said in Vilnius: ``We shouldn't be afraid of a
multiparty system the way the devil fears incense.''
   ``I see no tragedy in a multiparty system, if, and I can tell
you this straightforwardly, it arises as a result of a normal
historical process and answers the needs of society,'' he told a
meeting of the Lithuania's Communist Party, which strengthened the
republic's independence movement when it voted last month to break
from the national party.
   However, Gorbachev said allowing more than one political party
was ``no panacea'' for the nation's ills, and that his reforms of
``glasnost,'' or greater openness, and broader participation by
Soviets in public decision-making were more important.
   He did not say when rival parties might be allowed to organize
and run candidates nationwide, but his reference to the ``normal
historical process'' could mean such developments are not
immediately in the offing.
   Since the 1917 Russian Revolution, Communists have firmly held
the reins of power in the Soviet Union, but they are being
increasingly challenged by independent groups _ some calling
themselves parties _ that have sprung up in the atmosphere of
greater tolerance introduced by Gorbachev.
   Reforms Gorbachev put in place also led to popular uprisings
throughout the Soviet bloc and dramatic democratic reforms in
Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Romania and Bulgaria.
   Speakers at the meeting today told Gorbachev they were
unimpressed by his promises of greater autonomy as an alternative
to Lithuania's drive for full independence. They said their
Communist Party must also support independence to keep the people's
support.
   ``Our reality is that we Lithuanian Communists have no trump
cards in our dialogue with the people,'' said Vasily Yemelianov,
editor-in-chief of the newspaper Soviet Lithuania. ``The majority
of Lithuanians are ready to sacrifice their material benefits for
the sake of independence.''
   To reverse the December decision ``would mean death for the
Lithuanian Communist Party,'' Yemelianov said.
   In 1940 dictator Josef Stalin absorbed Lithuania and the two
other Baltic states, Estonia and Latvia, under a secret deal with
Nazi Germany.
   Instead of the conciliatory views Gorbachev came to elicit, he
heard at least two hours of speeches largely defending the local
party's decision.
   The speeches in the auditorium of the party's Central Committee
were broadcast on Lithuanian television, and a text of remarks made
by Gorbachev and others was provided for The Associated Press by
Lithuanian TV correspondent Eduardas Potesinskas.
   During his visit, Gorbachev repeatedly ran into crowds of
pro-independence protesters, and he tried to persuade them to hold
back in favor of staying in the Soviet Union but on new and better
terms of sovereignty.
   Gorbachev has faced ethnic turmoil and other domestic problems
as a result of his program of social and political reform, but
Lithuania's independence movement is probably the most serious
crisis during his five years in power.
   On Friday, a leader of the movement accused Gorbachev of laying
a ``propaganda trap'' in saying a draft law to be approved by a
national vote would provide the mechanism to secede.
   Gorbachev was greeted at the Bridai collective farm in Siauliai
earlier today by protesters carrying banners that read, ``We are
for an Independent Lithuania'' and ``Our Aim is the Independence of
Lithuania.''
   After an exasperating day of trying to get his message across,
Gorbachev showed his sense of humor was intact, telling the
demonstrators: ``OK, I have read them all, take a rest.''
   The crowd interrupted him frequently, and by the end of the
discussion, his smile had disappeared and his face was grim. The
scene was broadcast by government-run TV.
   With his wife, Raisa, and Lithuanian Communist Party chief
Algirdas Brazauskas standing beside him, Gorbachev cited economic
factors that he implied would make it better for Lithuanians to
remain in the union.
   ``Our ties within the country are very close,'' he said.
   The tiny republic of 3.7 million people receives 70 percent to
100 percent of its energy, oil and metals from the Russian
federation, Gorbachev told the farmers. But Brazauskas, who
supports the drive for independence, chimed in that the prices
Lithuania receives for its goods are far below world levels.
   Foreign reporters were not permitted to accompany Gorbachev to
Siauliai, 125 miles northwest of Vilnius, because it is a military
region closed to foreigners.

<HEAD>Soviet Troops Headed Home This Year From Eastern Europe?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Now that they have overturned the
Stalinist systems imposed on them by Moscow, some East Europeans
are demanding the Soviet troops that underwrote Communist rule in
their countries go home this year.
   The demands underscore the Soviets' waning influence in Eastern
Europe, and they will prove a test of Moscow's willingness to
relinquish control over a region where it has held sway for more
than 40 years.
   If realized, the demands could also put pressure on NATO to
match the Soviet troop pullouts with withdrawals of U.S. and other
Allied forces in Western Europe, perhaps escalating sharp cutbacks
already envisaged at Vienna talks on conventional arms reduction.
   Both superpowers already have signaled willingness at those
talks for sizeable cuts in their European forces. Washington
proposes a ceiling of 275,000 men each for the United States and
the Soviet Union, while the Soviets want slightly higher ceilings
that would remove other NATO forces from West Germany.
   The United States has about 300,000 troops stationed in Europe;
the Soviets have 575,000, according to U.S. estimates.
   The Vienna agreement probably would envisage phased withdrawal
over the next decade, rather than the immediate Soviet pullout this
year sought by Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
   East Germany, strategically most important to the Kremlin, has
made more modest demands. Communist Party leader Gregor Gysi
proposed all foreign troops leave both Germanys by 1999 _ a
timetable and balance that probably matches Moscow's thinking.
   Romania and Bulgaria, with no Soviet troops, are silent on the
issue, while the prospect of German reunification leaves Poland in
the awkward position of viewing the Warsaw Pact as a guarantor of
its current borders.
   The most strident demand for swift Soviet withdrawal has come
from Prague, whose new coalition government opens negotiations Jan.
15 with the Soviets on the pullout of Red Army soldiers who arrived
with the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion and never left.
   ``I suggest that the Soviet troops should withdraw from
Czechoslovakia by the end of 1990,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman
Lubos Dobrovsky, like his minister and friend Jiri Dienstbier a
former dissident, said last week.
   In Hungary, too, Soviet troops arrived to suppress revolution _
the 1956 uprising against Stalinism _ and, as in Czechoslovakia,
stayed under bilateral agreements now declared void in Prague and
considered invalid by most Hungarians.
   After the foreign affairs and military committees of Hungary's
parliament demanded withdrawal by the end of this year, Hungarian
Premier Miklos Nemeth met Soviet Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov last
week to arrange bilateral talks on the issue.
   But Nemeth _ unlike the current Prague government _ has stressed
the withdrawal depends on agreement on Europe-wide troop reductions
at the Vienna talks.
   Some 10,000 Soviet soldiers already have left both Hungary and
Czechoslovakia under the phased withdrawal of 50,000 men from
Eastern Europe, which was announced by Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev in December 1988.
   An additional 6,000 of the 52,000 Soviet troops said to be left
in Hungary are due to leave this year, and an undisclosed number
are scheduled to leave Czechoslovakia, where officials say there
are some 70,000 Soviet forces.
   A tank regiment of 1,300 men, an anti-aircraft regiment, a
helicopter regiment and two battalions withdrew from Poland in
1989, with an additional brigade of landing and assault troops due
to leave this year.
   But Poland, in many fields an outspoken leader of Eastern
Europe's pull away from the Kremlin, has been quiet about demanding
a full withdrawal of Soviet troops.
   ``Poland is one of the strongest supporters of the Warsaw Pact
left in Eastern Europe,'' noted Hans Bennendijk, director of
studies at London's International Institute of Strategic Studies.
   Poland has suffered throughout its history from being sandwiched
between Russia and Germany. With talk of German reunification
growing, the Warsaw Pact is protection against suggestions in West
Germany of reclaiming former German territory that became part of
Poland after World War II.
   East Germany traditionally was viewed by Red Army chiefs as the
biggest conquest in the vast chunks of territory won in World War
II, protecting the Russians from a repeat of the devastating Nazi
attack in 1941 and enabling the Kremlin to threaten Western Europe.
   Moscow has about 380,000 troops in East Germany.
   Gysi's 1999 deadline for all foreign forces to leave both
Germanys fits better with the Kremlin's thinking than quick
withdrawals this year.
   At the Vienna talks, the United States has proposed reducing
U.S. and Soviet troops stationed abroad in the NATO and Warsaw Pact
nations to 275,000 for each superpower.
   The Soviet Union, eager to see cuts bite into the British,
French and Canadian presence in West Germany, is talking of 300,000
to 350,000 troops stationed abroad in each alliance, Western
diplomats at the negotiations say.
   The diplomats, speaking on condition they not be identified, say
that total alone suggests the Soviets were considering withdrawing
from less strategic nations such as Hungary _ which has no border
with NATO _ to save most of their East German presence.
   But the demands from Prague and Budapest mean the Soviets lose
the flexibility to scatter troop cuts as they want, and can no
longer make the withdrawals so gradual.
   A preliminary agreement at the Vienna talks is envisaged by the
end of this year, but negotiators expect it to take most of the
1990s for East and West to slice the huge weapons arsenals and
armies amassed in four decades of Cold War.
   ``This must come as an unpleasant surprise to Moscow,''
Bennendijk said in a telephone interview. ``But what choice do they
have? They are not in Czechoslovakia (for instance) as occupying
powers.''

   There was a video game controller the player
doesn't even need to touch. There was hand-held copier and fax unit
that can send and receive transmissions from cellular phones. There
was a television screen measuring 120 inches _ yes, 10 feet _ from
corner to corner.
   Industry officials predict more than $10 billion in orders will
evolve from the Winter Consumer Electronics Show, which closed
Tuesday after displaying what's hot in electronic gadgetry for the
1990s.
   Thousands of products captured the imagination of the more than
70,000 manufacturers, dealers and journalists who visited during
the four-day show.
   ``We thought it was quite successful,'' show spokeswoman Cynthia
Upson said Thursday. ``We talked to many retailers and exhibitors.
They were quite pleased it was such a tremendous show.
   ``The mood for 1990 is very upbeat,'' she added. ``These
retailers just came off the Christmas selling season. Many were
here looking into what's new for a new decade. Retailers say they
expect a nice volume for the spring selling season. When you hear
that, you know you've had a successful show.''
   Show officials say the winter electronics show and its summer
counterpart, which is held in Chicago, together stimulate orders
totaling more than half of the consumer electronics industry's
sales.
   Factory sales for the industry are expected to reach a record
$33.412 billion in 1990, up from $32.166 billion in 1989.
   The major players at the show were big ticket items such as home
entertainment advances _ giant video and surround-sound audio _
that turn a living room into a home theater. Also displayed were
digital sound systems that give a car or home the sound of a
concert hall or cathedral.
   Mitsubishi introduced a rear-projection TV with a 120-inch
screen. The set measures 8 feet wide, 6 feet high and 6.5 feet
deep. The tab: $20,000.
   New home automation devices allow a person away from home turn
on the dishwasher, lock doors, set alarms, program the VCR or turn
on the air conditioner, all by telephone.
   But smaller electronic gadgets continued to capture the
imagination of visitors to the show, which has been dubbed a
Disneyland for adults.
   Broderbund Software unveiled a video game controller that it
says eliminates all physical contact between player and machine.
Instead of a joystick or button, the player uses hand movement to
produce a response. In the ``Mike Tyson's Punch-Out'' game, for
example, throw a left jab in the air and you throw a left jab at
the video version of the champ.
   Panasonic-Technics offered a car radio that owners can can
program for their favorite type of music _ jazz, easy listening,
country-western, whatever. The radio then picks up the top station
in the selected category as the driver moves from city to city.
   Blaupunkt Borsch Telecom introduced an electronic car navigation
system that allows drivers to follow a video map to get to their
destination.
   Franklin Computer and SelecTronic introduced hand-held computers
that seek out Bible verses with the touch of a button. Franklin
also displayed a tiny computer that provides definitions, spelling
and grammatical guidelines for more than 250,000 words in Spanish
and English.
   Singer Michael Jackson gets into the act with a new video game
by Sega dubbed ``Moonwalker.'' The game features detailed
antimation based on actual film footage of Jackson's dance moves.
In the game, Jackson rescues children who have been kidnapped by an
evil enemy.
   Ricoh offered compact products for the office on-the-go,
including a hand-held copier and fax unit that can send and receive
transmissions from modular or cellular phones.
   Ms. Upson said there was a growing interest in phone and office
electronic equipment because some 25 million Americans now have
offices in their homes.
   ``The dealers and manufacturers realize there is a tremendous
potential there,'' she said.

   Dennis and Cheryl Avery were a quiet
couple who never had much money but were devoted to their three
daughters and their church.
   Unhappy with the ordination of women and other changes in the
church, they followed lay minister Jeffrey Lundgren to Ohio and
became allied with his breakaway fundamentalist cult. They
apparently became so controlled by him they turned over their
paychecks and bought a gun for him on their credit card.
   And it may have been that very gun that killed them and their
daughters last spring, police say. Lundgren and other cult members
are charged in their slayings.
   ``They were very sweet, very family-oriented people,'' said
Norma Corkern, a librarian who made friends with the Averys more
than 10 years ago in Independence. ``Very loving. It just didn't
make sense for them to be there.''
   Avery, 49; Mrs. Avery, 42; and daughters Trina, 15, Rebecca, 13,
and Karen, 7, were last seen in April, shortly after they told
others in Ohio that they were moving to Wyoming.
   Their bodies were found Jan. 3-4 at the farm commune near
Kirtland, Ohio, where the cult stayed, after police received an
anonymous tip. They had been bound with duct tape, shot and buried
in a barn. Police theorize that the deaths were a ritual sacrifice
to cleanse the cult.
   Lundgren, 39, his 19-year-old son and three other cult members
are charged with their murders. His wife and seven others are
charged with conspiracy.
   The deaths left those who knew them struggling to understand
what went wrong.
   ``I just think they didn't know what they were getting into when
they went to Kirtland,'' said Marie Haworth, a friend from
Independence.
   Avery and his wife both grew up on the West Coast as members of
the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, a
church that has roots in common with the Mormon Church but is
separate. They were married in Independence, where the church is
based, in 1970.
   Avery, who worked 17 years as a computer programmer for a Kansas
City bank, was a deacon in one of the RLDS congregations dotting
the Independence area. Mrs. Avery taught preschool and Sunday
school, sewed her family's clothes and took her bookworm daughters
to summer reading programs at the public library.
   The family lived in a small house in an older section of
Independence. The daughters attended public schools until May 1986,
then were schooled at home, church records show.
   When the RLDS church voted to ordain women in 1984, the Averys
and many others were unhappy, Mrs. Haworth said. They moved to a
different congregation, where they met Lundgren, who had grown up
in Independence and been ordained an RLDS lay minister.
   Lundgren moved to Kirtland in 1984 to become a volunteer guide
at an RLDS temple, and the Averys followed in 1987.
   No one knows when Lundgren and his followers made the switch
from his fundamentalist RLDS teachings to a cult whose members
drank heavily, trained for paramilitary activities and called their
leader ``the prophet,'' said Grant McMurry, the RLDS' world church
secretary.
   Mrs. Avery's mother, Donna Bailey of Centralia, Wash., said she
telephoned and wrote her daughter frequently after the Averys moved
to Ohio.
   ``I caught on early on that these were the wrong types of
beliefs,'' Mrs. Bailey said in an interview published Friday in The
Kansas City Times. ``At one time she said, `People think we're a
cult, but we're not.' That made me concerned.''
   Shortly after the Averys arrived in Ohio, Lundgren was asked to
resign from the temple position, and he was eventually defrocked
after his teachings became ``un-Christian,'' said the Rev. Dale
Luffman, head of the northeast Ohio chapter of RLDS.
   The Averys broke all ties with the RLDS church after Lundgren
was asked to resign.
   Unlike most of Lundgren's followers, the Averys lived in town,
about three miles from the commune. Avery worked at a security
company and did odd jobs. His wife worked at a fast food
restaurant. Dennis Yarborough, police chief in Kirtland, said cult
members turned over their paychecks to Lundgren.
   Lundgren often seemed irritated with Avery, according to John
Olivarez, whose daughter once lived at the commune. Bonnie
Olivarez, then 11, lived there with her mother in spring 1988,
until Olivarez regained custody. The mother is charged in the
murders.
   Olivarez said according to his daughter, Lundgren ``would
complain that Mr. Avery could only do five pushups. Everybody else
was doing 20 or 30.''
   The Averys moved in the fall of 1988 to a home about 30 miles
from the commune, leaving several months of back rent unpaid, said
landlord Stan Skrbis in Kirtland. But the family apparently kept
its ties with the cult.
   Avery used his credit card to buy a .45-caliber gun for Lundgren
shortly before the killings. Authorities say a gun of that caliber
was used in the murders.
   No one knows why the Averys were picked.
   ``These were all people from nice families in our community _
not just the Averys but the people who are in trouble, too,'' said
Mrs. Haworth.
   Mrs. Corkern added, ``The worst thing is those little girls _
they never had a chance.''

<HEAD>Iraq to Match Iranian POW Release, Red Cross Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALAH NASRAWI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Red Cross announced Saturday that Iraq
has agreed to free 50 disabled Iranian POWs, clearing the way for
the first prisoner exchange between the two countries in more than
a year.
   Peace talks between Iran and Iraq have been stalled almost since
they began in August 1988, and the deadlock has left an estimated
100,000 captives on both sides languishing in POW camps. Some have
been held since the early stages of the war, which began in
September 1980.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross said 50 Iranian
POWs will be released and returned to Iran after Iran returns 50
Iraqi prisoners to Baghdad.
   Iran's U.N. ambassador, Kamal Kharrazi, announced in New York
last week that Iran would release the ailing Iraqis.
   The Iraqi authorities have ``promised to reciprocate with the
release of an equal number'' of POWs, a Red Cross official said
Saturday.
   The Iraqis are scheduled to be set free Wednesday, said the
officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. They said a Swiss
airliner had been chartered to fly the Iraqis home.
   U.N. officials have registered 55,000 POWs held by Iran and
19,500 by Iraqi, but they believe the total held by both sides is
about 100,000. Both sides hold a total of about 1,000 ailing or
disabled prisoners.
   The 1948 Geneva Convention stipulates that all prisoners of war
should be released when hostilities cease.
   A cease-fire halted fighting between Iran and Iraq in August
1988, but the POWs have become pawns as both sides quarrel over
details of the U.N. resolution that cleared the way for the
cease-fire.
   In 1988, the two sides exchanged about 400 disabled and ailing
prisoners. The operation collapsed in November of that year as each
country accused the other of lying about the number of captives
they held.
   This month, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein offered to restart
the peace talks and said Iraq was ready to exchange all disabled
and sick prisoners as a first step toward a total prisoner exchange.
   Iran countered that it would not agree to total swap, or to
implement other clauses of the cease-fire resolution, until Iraq
withdrew from Iranian border areas captured during the final days
of fighting.
   But Iranian officials have expressed support for a Soviet offer
to mediate a new round of peace talks.
   The Soviets have close links with Iraq and were its main arms
supplier during the war. Relations between Moscow and Tehran have
improved considerably since the war ended.
   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said Tehran would
consider any Soviet proposal ``containing a systematic and clearly
defined formula for the implementation of U.N. Security Council
Resolution 598,'' the cease-fire resolution.
   The Iraqi foreign ministry also welcomed the Soviet offer.

<TEXT>
   A prominent leftist Salvadoran politician
who was reportedly kidnapped in Guatemala City was found shot to
death near the Guatemala-El Salvador border, officials said today.
   No one claimed responsibility for the slaying, but a Guatemalan
politician blamed it on Guatemalan and Salvadoran paramilitary
groups.
   The body of Hector Oqueli Colindres, 45, deputy
secretary-general of the National Revolutionary Movement in El
Salvador, was discovered Friday night in Jalpatagua, a city 60
miles east of Guatemala City, his party said.
   Oqueli had been shot in the head, a spokesman for the opposition
National Revolutionary Movement said in El Salvador.
   Gilda Flores, a Guatemalan who was driving Oqueli to the airport
in Guatemala City when they were reportedly kidnapped Friday, also
was found dead, according to the party official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Mario Solorzano Martinez, secretary-general of Guatemala's
Social Democratic Party, confirmed the party's report and deplored
the slayings.
   ``We energetically condemn this act, which shows that the
authorities are inefficient,'' he said. ``...this is an combined
action of Guatemalan and Salvadoran paramilitary forces. It's
obvious this was well planned.''
   He said the victims' bodies were taken to a hospital in Cuilapa,
40 miles east of Guatemala City and would be moved to a funeral
home in Guatemala City.
   Oqueli and Ms. Flores were abducted by armed men early Friday
morning, his party said in an earlier statement.
   The Salvadoran politician was reportedly on his way to Managua,
where he was to help monitor preparations for the Nicaraguan
election on Feb. 25.
   Oqueli, who had been in Guatemala since Jan. 11, also was
reportedly planning to attend a meeting of Latin American socialist
leaders in Ecuador.
   The leader of the National Revolutionary Movement, Guillermo
Ungo, was the presidential candidate of a leftist coalition in the
March elections in El Salvador. Ungo could not immediately be
reached for comment today.
   Before his body was found, Oqueli's party condemned his
kidnapping, saying it ``demonstrates again the insecurity that
exists in our country.''
   Oqueli was a deputy foreign minister in Salvador from October
1979 until March 1980, when a military coup overthrew the
government. Like many other leftists, he quit El Salvador after the
coup, but he returned to his country in 1987 to participate in
politics.
   The slayings come at a time of increasing political violence in
El Salvador and Guatemala, where rightist factions have
longstanding ties.
   The governing rightist party in El Salvador, known by the
Spanish acronym Arena, was founded in Guatemala in the 1970s.

   Cuba continues to be an important military and
intelligence asset for the Soviet Union and the long-standing
Moscow-Havana alliance is expected to survive deepening ideological
differences, according to analysts.
   There is little question that the relationship is far less
relaxed than it was before Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
assumed power but the consensus among experts is that Cuba is too
valuable for the Soviets to cast aside.
   Still, as U.S. officials see it, there is evidence of a decline
in Soviet assistance to Cuba, a trend that may continue but not to
the point where the survival of the regime is threatened. One
example of the strength of the relationship was the recent delivery
of Soviet MiG-29 jet fighters to Cuba, the officials say.
   Says Cornell University professor Rhoda Rabkin, ``There is
little sign that the Gorbachev era leadership considers Cuba an
expendable Soviet commitment.''
   Among other assets, she notes the Soviets have an extensive
electronic intelligence gathering facility in Cuba and
installations that enable Soviet long-range reconnaissance aircraft
to monitor U.S. East Coast military activities. Thanks to Cuba, the
Soviets also are able to maintain a strategic naval presence in the
Caribbean.
   Professor Jaime Suchlicki of the University of Miami's Institute
of Inter-American Studies points out that these Soviet activities
have forced the United States to install expensive surveillance and
tracking facilities to keep an eye on the Soviets.
   Gillian Gunn, an associate at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, a Washington research group, says Soviet
leaders have been cool to U.S. admonitions that they distance
themselves from Castro.
   Gorbachev has left the impression he opposes Castro's effort to
promote subversion in the hemisphere. But the Soviets have told
U.S. officials privately they have no way of knowing how Castro
would react if they pushed him too hard, according to Ms. Gunn.
``If they tinker with his aid, he could mess around with their
military access,'' she says, summing up Soviet concerns.
   Soviet bloc arms continue to find their way to Central America
via Cuba, but the Bush administration is more inclined to blame
Havana than Moscow.
   Uncertainty about Soviet-Cuban relations has arisen as a result
of Castro's repudiation of perestroika and glasnost and Gorbachev's
willingness to nudge hard-line regimes from power in Eastern Europe.
   A strain in relations was evident last summer when Castro banned
two Soviet Spanish-language publications because he was offended by
their irreverent comments about socialism. Castro has said that
death is preferable to abandonment of socialism.
   U.S. officials say there is one area in which Soviet aid to Cuba
appears to have dried up. The Soviets used to provide Cuba with
surplus oil, enabling Castro to sell the commodity at world market
prices for a handsome profit.
   According to the Economist Newsletter, revenues from oil exports
reached $621 million in 1985 and then fell sharply. Last year, the
earnings were ``almost certainly nothing,'' it said.
   Gorbachev has called for ``stricter accountability'' in the way
Cuba uses Soviet aid, estimated at $4.3 billion by U.S. officials.
No recipient of U.S. aid gets nearly as much.
   One official said that given Gorbachev's emphasis on improving
living standards in the Soviet Union, ``he would like to reduce his
economic burden in Cuba (further) but not to be point where the
survivability of the regime comes into doubt.''
   One test of the durability of the Soviet-Cuban relationship will
come next year when payments on Cuba's substantial Soviet debt,
estimated at $10 billion, fall due.
   It is widely expected that Cuba will ask for lenient terms. Just
how accommodating the Soviets will be remains a question mark.

<HEAD>Quayle Says He'll Push in Latin America for Recognition of Panama
Regime</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURIE SULLIVAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARK CITY, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle said Saturday
he will press Latin American nations to recognize the U.S-installed
Panamanian government when he travels to the region.
   Quayle, in Utah for a fund-raising ski race, told a news
conference he intends to go beyond fence-mending during three trips
he plans to Central and South America over the next two to eight
weeks.
   ``The president wants me to go down and have a very strong
consultation process with our Latin American friends,'' Quayle
said. ``The mission is one to not only have consultations, but to
talk about the liberation aspects of the people of Panama.''
   Many Latin American officials say Quayle will have a tough time
explaining the Dec. 20 invasion by 14,000 U.S. troops as anything
other than a violation of Panama's sovereignty, especially while an
invasion force remains.
   But the vice president said from his talks with Latin leaders,
he is convinced they understand that President Bush ordered troops
into Panama as a last resort.
   Quayle's itinerary is still being put together, with the only
announced stop his attendance at the Jan. 27 presidential
inauguration in Honduras.
   As for shoring up the civilian government of Guillermo Endara,
installed as Panama's president after the ouster of Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, Quayle said one of the first things the United
States can do is ``to attempt to have other governments recognize
the Endara government.''
   Endara was a presidential candidate in a May 7 election that
independent observers said he won handily but which was
subsequently invalidated by Noriega. Some Latin American nations
contend Endara, to earn authority on his own, must be installed
either by a new election or by the Panamanian Congress.
   Quayle said the new government has the support of the Panamanian
people, but must now make strong efforts to build a judicial
system, reform the Panamanian Defense Force, and strengthen the
economy.
   ``What's important now is that Endara moves forward to hold and
maintain the support he has now,'' Quayle said.
   The vice president made these other comments:
   _ He said Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev is in ``full control
of the political situation in his country, and is doing his best to
reform a situation that desperately needs to be reformed.''
   _ He predicted disappointment for those who have suggested that
changes in Eastern Europe will save the United States money on
defense. ``Obviously, there will be modest changes in expenditures
for national security, but no huge shift in domestic and
non-domestic spending,'' Quayle said.
   _ He took issue with use of the word ``blockade'' to describe
the recent presence of U.S. naval forces off the coast of Colombia.
He said the vessels went to the area only in the event the
Colombian government needed assistance in cracking down on the drug
trade. ``We will not impose ourselves on the Colombians,'' he said.

<HEAD>Reported US Memories Failure Said Sign of Need for High-Tech
Policy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The reported impending shutdown of a $1
billion private consortium to produce computer memory chips points
to the need for new government policies to help encourage long-term
investment by high-technology companies, a congressman said
Saturday.
   The seven-company joint venture, U.S. Memories, had been
launched last summer as an effort to challenge Japanese dominance
of the memory chip market.
   Rep. Robert S. Walker, R-Pa., ranking minority member of the
House Science, Space and Technology Committee, responded to
published reports that U.S. Memories would announce Monday it was
folding because it had failed to attract enough investors.
   ``I think what it indicates is the need for national policies
that encourage a better investment climate for high-tech
industries,'' Walker said.
   He added: ``Part of the problem right now is that our investment
climate in this country is not such that most businesses want to
take long-term risks. And that is apparently one of the
considerations here.''
   Walker said that to help deal with this situation, Congress
should enact the capital-gains tax reduction being advocated by the
Bush administration and also should approve a permanent extension
of the research and development tax credit.
   The New York Times, The Washington Post and the Austin (Texas)
American-Statesman carried stories Saturday citing unidentified
electronics industry sources as saying the dissolution of U.S.
Memories would be announced at a news conference Monday in Santa
Clara, Calif.
   The Times said that while Sanford L. Kane, president of U.S.
Memories, would not comment on the reports, he did say he was
extremely frustrated by his failure to persuade computer companies
to sign up for the venture.
   ``One can only bang their head against the wall for so long.
Sooner or later you get a headache,'' the Times quoted Kane as
saying.
   U.S. Memories had planned to raise $500 million in equity from
computer and semiconductor companies and $500 million in debt to
build a large-scale memory chip plant.
   However, the venture has not been able to sign up any investors
beyond the seven companies that launched U.S. Memories last June.
Those members were three computer companies _ IBM, Digital
Equipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard _ and four semiconductor
companies _ Advanced Micro Devices, Intel, LSI Logic and National
Semiconductor.
   Today U.S. companies rely primarily on Japanese manufacturers of
dynamic random-access memory chips, or DRAMs. In 1988, Japan
controlled about 80 percent of the $6.4 billion market.
   Currently, DRAMs have been in ample supply and prices have
plummeted, thus removing the urgency for a new domestic source such
as U.S. Memories.
   However, U.S. Memories supporters had warned that companies
rejecting the idea merely because of the current market glut were
being shortsighted.
   On that issue, The Washington Post quoted Brookings Institution
analyst Kenneth Flamm as saying: ``The bottom line is that the
great memory glut is going to be a short-term phenomenon.''

<HEAD>Albanian Border Guard Claims Unrest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newspapers on Saturday quoted an Albanian
border guard who fled the country as saying security forces fired
on protesters last week and that one city was in a state of
``revolution.''
   Yugoslavia's Tanjug news agency, meanwhile, said there was
``nothing unusual'' going on in Albania, one day after reporting
that authorities there had imposed a virtual state of emergency to
prevent unrest.
   Also Saturday, the Albanian state-run news agency ATA quoted an
Italian diplomat as denying there was unrest in the isolated
country.
   Albania, located between Greece and Yugoslavia, is the last
bastion of Stalinism in Eastern Europe and is closed to most
foreigners, so none of the reports could be independently confirmed.
   Daily newspapers in Greece on Saturday quoted Albert Tzeka, 20,
as saying widespread protests had broken out in at least three
cities in his country against the hard-line Communist leadership.
   ``The people have risen up. The people and the students ...
especially in Shkoder, Korce and Sarande,'' Tzeka was quoted as
saying.
   ``In Shkoder there is a revolution. The army and the sigurimi
(security police) fired on the people and there are many dead and
injured,'' the daily Kathimerini quoted Tzeka as saying.
   Yugoslav and Greek newspapers have carried unconfirmed reports
since Thursday of demonstrations and a state of emergency in
Shkoder, Albania's second-largest city.
   Tzeka said that in Shkoder, ``the police, wanting to subdue the
demonstrators, fired upon them. They hanged four students to set an
example.'' He added that the demonstrators seemed determined to
continue their uprising.
   The Athens newspapers did not say how Tzeka, who was serving on
the southern Albanian border, obtained his information,
particularly about Shkoder, which is in the north.
   The newspaper Eleftherotypia quoted Tzeka as saying that ``we
learn everything in my country by word of mouth.''
   Tzeka said also that border patrols along the Greek and Yugoslav
borders were intensified after the December uprising in Romania,
which ousted the Stalinist leadership of Nicolae Ceausescu.
   He was quoted as saying Albanian soldiers had been ordered to
kill anyone trying to escape.
   An officer at the Greek border village of Filiates confirmed
Tzeka crossed the Albanian border Tuesday and requested political
asylum.
   Albanian authorities have consistently denied any trouble in
their country, describing reports of turmoil as ``slander.''
   Tzeka could not be reached by The Associated Press on Saturday.
   In Yugoslavia, the Tanjug news agency said information available
from police and travelers at the Yugoslav-Albanian border Saturday
suggested there was ``nothing unusual, nothing special'' in Albania.
   It said even shopping trips by diplomats in Albania, who usually
visit the Yugoslav towns of Struga and Ohrid over the weekend, have
not been halted.
   On Friday, Tanjug reported that ``Albanian authorities, in an
effort to prevent unrest against the regime, have imposed extremely
strict control measures in the country.''
   It said the security measures ``can be termed a state of
emergency,'' but did not say when the measures were allegedly
imposed.
   Albania's ATA news agency Saturday quoted Paolo de Nicola, the
interim charge d'affaires of the Italian Embassy in Tirana, as
saying at the Foreign Ministry that Italian media reports about
unrest in Albania ``do not refer to reality, they are groundless.''
   Miloslav Milic, a reporter for Belgrade television from
Yugoslavia's Kosovo province which borders Alabania, told The
Associated Press that ``frequent sound of firearms'' was heard
Friday from the direction of Albania.

<HEAD>1 Killed, 10 Wounded in Tripoli Bombings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Three bombs exploded near Syrian army
checkpoints in a commerical district of Tripoli on Saturday,
killing one civilian, wounding 10 and causing panic among commuters
during the morning rush hour.
   Elsewhere, scattered clashes were reported Saturday between
rival forces in Beirut and south Lebanon, but no casualties were
reported.
   Late Friday, a bomb exploded near the abandoned Saudi Arabian
Embassy in a residential neighborhood of west Beirut, but no
injuries were reported.
   None of the feuding factions in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war
claimed responsibility for the explosions at three different
locations on the sidewalks of Tripoli. However, a police spokesman
who demanded anonymity said they were probably a protest of the
Syrian military presence in the city.
   Police said panic swept Tripoli's central business section when
the bombs detonated a few minutes apart around 9 a.m. Police said
frightened motorists caused major traffic jams trying to flee the
area.
   Tripoli's 850,000 inhabitants are mainly Sunni Moslems, who work
on Saturday and take Friday off.
   Each bomb contained about six pounds of TNT and exploded within
15 yards of Syrian checkpoints in Lebanon's second-largest city, 50
miles north of Beirut.
   Tripoli has been policed by the Syrian army since 1983, when
Syrian-backed dissident Palestinian groups forced Yasser Arafat's
Palestine Liberation Organizaion from their last stronghold in
Lebanon after Israel's 1982 invasion.
   A bombing campaign also occurred in Moslem west Beirut after
Syrian troops arrived there in 1987 to end three years of anarchy
by feuding Moslem militias.
   Saturday's explosions shattered windows within a two-mile
radius, leaving streets carpeted with glass shards, and damaged 14
cars, police reported. They said the fatality from the first blast
was a 65-year-old electrical tools salesman. The other casualties
were passers-by.
   Tripoli's Coordination Committee, which runs day-to-day
administrative affairs, blamed the bombings on the forces of the
rebel Christian leader, Gen. Michel Aoun, who seeks to force the
Syrian army out of Lebanon.
   ``This is the way the outlaw general sees fit to carry on his
so-called war of liberation,'' the committee declared in a
statement.
   Aoun's mainly Christian army units and Syrian-backed Moslem
militiamen clashed with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades
before dawn across Beirut's dividing Green Line Saturday. Police
reported no casualties in the one-hour firefight. But it underlined
a marked increase in tension in the divided capital.
   At least four people have been killed ans 12 wounded in
gunbattles along the three-mile-long demarcation line in the last
week.
   The violence violates a cease-fire that took effect in
September, ending six months of fierce artillery battles between
Aoun's troops and the Syrians.
   The four-pound bomb in Beirut exploded late Friday night under a
car parked 80 yards from the abandoned Saudi Arabian Embassy in the
residential Manara neighborhood of west Beirut.
   The embassy was closed in 1985 after it was ransacked and burned
by Shiite Moslem militants of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or
Party of God.
   They were protesting Saudi curbs on the number of Iranians
allowed to make the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, Islam's holiest
city, after riots there in 1987 that the Saudis blamed on Iranian
instigators.

<HEAD>Arizona Faces Renewed Debate Over Martin Luther King Holiday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM F. RAWSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Arizona lawmakers ended years of bitter
debate in September by creating a state holiday to honor the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr., it seemed the issue finally had been put to
rest.
   But four months later, as 46 other states and the federal
government prepare to honor the slain civil rights leader on
Monday, Arizona's holiday is on hold and the state faces more
months of divisive debate before voters settle the controversy in
November.
   Democratic Gov. Bruce Babbitt declared a holiday by executive
order in 1986, but it was rescinded by his successor, Republican
Evan Mecham, after the state attorney general ruled that Babbitt's
order was illegal.
   Year after year, the Republican-controlled Legislature refused
to enact the holiday but offered to put it before the voters.
Supporters rejected that option, saying privately that they feared
it would be rejected and that the campaign would divide the state
and cause further harm to its image.
   Democrat Rose Mofford, who became governor when Mecham was
removed by impeachment convictions, finally found the key to
getting a King holiday bill through the Legislature during a
September special session.
   She got business leaders to spur lawmakers into action by
arguing that not having a King holiday was hurting the state's
economy and could kill its chances of landing the 1993 Super Bowl.
   Dozens of conventions and meetings had been canceled in 1987 and
1988 in a boycott to protest Mecham's cancellation of the holiday.
The state estimated the lost convention and tourism receipts at
more than $25 million.
   The Legislature agreed to the holiday, but only if it supplanted
Columbus Day so that state employees would not be given an
additional paid day off.
   That set the stage for two groups _ those who didn't think King
deserved a holiday and the Italian-Americans who wanted Columbus
Day preserved _ to launch a petition drive to put the issue on the
November ballot.
   They collected nearly 80,000 petition signatures, nearly twice
the number required, in only three months.
   The King holiday was put on hold in December pending the outcome
of the referendum effort. Among other things, that means Arizona
still will observe Columbus Day in 1990.
   Julian Sanders, a conservative activist who spearheaded the
petition drive, said he was convinced that a majority of Arizonans
don't want a King holiday.
   ``The people in Arizona are really angry about what's
transpired,'' he said. ``It will still go down 2 to 1.''
   Supporters of the holiday have begun organizing for what many
believe will be a bitter campaign, and say they fear the rejection
of the King holiday here could strengthen opposition to the holiday
elsewhere.
   ``Should Arizona rescind the King holiday, this will simply be
the first state to put that issue on the ballot,'' said Sen.
Carolyn Walker, the only black in the state Senate. ``Then it will
go like dominos.''
   Noting that pressure from the business community was a key in
passing the King holiday bill in September, supporters hoped for
continued support from that sector.
   ``For me, it's the wrong motivation,'' said Dr. Paul Eppinger,
pastor of the First Baptist Church of Phoenix and a leading
proponent of the King holiday. ``But if that's the motivation that
stimulates people, I'll take it.''
   Business leaders pledged support Friday at a Martin Luther King
breakfast in Phoenix.
   ``The business community is very eager to get the holiday
passed, whatever the cost is to the Legislature,'' said Bill
Shover, director of public affairs for Phoenix Newspapers Inc.,
which publishes The Arizona Republic and The Phoenix Gazette.
   Shover, who also is chairman of the Phoenix '93 Committee that's
bidding to bring the 1993 Super Bowl to Phoenix, said business
leaders fear a renewed economic boycott of the state.
   Sanders argues the state has not suffered economically because
of the King controversy; and even if it had, that is not the issue.
   ``If we don't have a majority in this state that wants to honor
Martin Luther King for what he was as a man, then the whole thing
is a fraud and a sham,'' Sanders said.
   State lawmakers say it is unlikely any legislative action will
be taken on the issue before November.
   ``This is an election year,'' said state Rep. Sandra Kennedy, a
supporter of the King holiday. ``No one wants to say anything about
the King holiday. They're all saying, `Let's let it go to a vote of
the people.'''

   L. Douglas Wilder was inaugurated today as
America's first elected black governor, which he called a triumph
for the principles in the Declaration of Independence.
   Wilder, a grandson of slaves, said he wanted young people to
hear Thomas Jefferson's words about freedom, so he included them in
his remarks as he became Virginia's 66th governor on the grounds of
the former capital of the Confederacy. Jefferson himself served as
Virginia governor in Revolutionary War times.
   Wilder said he wanted young listerners ``to know that oppression
can be lifted, that discrimination can be eliminated, that poverty
need not be binding, that disability can be overcome.''
   He reminded them, though, that the offer of opportunity
``carries with it the requirement of hard work, the rejection of
drugs and other false highs, and a willingness to work with others
whatever their color or national origin.''
   Retired Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. of the U.S. Supreme Court
administered the oath of office to Wilder, who had been lieutenant
governor, before 15,000 guests at the Capitol.
   The 58-year-old Wilder, a self-proclaimed ``mainstream''
Democrat, won the closest gubernatorial election in Virginia
history on Nov. 7. A recount demanded by Republican opponent J.
Marshall Coleman resulted in a Dec. 21 certification of a
6,741-vote victory margin, or less than half a percent.
   He is the first black elected governor in any state, but one
black, P.B.S. Pinchback, served temporarily as Louisiana governor
for 43 days in late 1872 and early 1873 after the governor was
impeached and removed from office.
   The inauguration was preceded by a prayer service at St. Paul's
Episcopal Church, where Confederate President Jefferson Davis was
confirmed, and the ceremonial presentation of the keys to the
Executive Mansion by outgoing Gov. Gerald L. Baliles.
   Jesse Jackson and former tennis star Arthur Ashe attended the
prayer service. Wilder hadn't let Jackson campaign on his behalf,
but Wilder's press secretary, Laura Dillard, said Jackson was
invited to the inauguration because ``it's appropriate. He's a
leading national figure in Democratic circles.''
   Jackson described the inauguration as a historic moment.
   ``To go from the hull of a slave ship to governor is a great
American story,'' he said. ``It's a great world story.''
   Wilder said Virginians are witnessing times when the ``whirlinds
of rebellion shake all shores where tyranny once ruled, and we are
redeemed in our deeply held and treasured beliefs in the
development of the high possibility of every individual who
breathes the sweetness of liberty's air.''
   Wilder said his administration would be challenged to maintain
freedom because of the slowing economy.
   ``But progress will be possible ...,'' he said. ``Resources
employed in the past for the finer things in life can be _ and will
have to be _ deployed for the more serious of our needs. For we
know that freedom is but a word for the man or woman who needs and
cannot find a job.''
   About 12,500 tickets were sold for the Inaugural Ball at the
Richmond Coliseum, and a huge tent was erected outside to handle
the overflow crowd. Tickets cost $50 and box seats went for $2,500
to $7,500.
   Wilder, who is divorced, said his son and two daughters would
accompany him to the ball.
   He was to deliver his first gubernatorial address to the General
Assembly on Monday.

<TEXT>
   Two men who served Japan's war effort in
Malaysia during World War II and remained in a remote jungle to
help Communist rebels for 45 years returned home Saturday saying
they hope to help modern-day Japan.
   Relatives and friends greeted Shigeyuki Hashimoto, 71, and
Kiyoaki Tanaka, 77, with flowers at Tokyo's Narita airport as the
men, appearing frail and weary, were taken from their plane in
wheelchairs.
   The two, who left in 1944 to work in a wartime Japanese iron
factory in Malaysia _ then called Malaya _ said they joined
Communist guerrillas after the war in 1945 to help the country gain
independence from Britain, Japan's former enemy.
   ``We fought for a long time and faced a range of difficulties,''
Hashimoto told reporters. ``We lost touch with all of our old
friends. Now only the two of us are still alive.''
   On Wednesday, the two men left the Malaysian border jungle where
they and their comrades in the Communist Party of Malaya fought for
45 years.
   The insurgency ended in December, when Communist leaders reached
a peace agreement with Malaysian and Thai government officials.
   ``We're Japanese, so we never forgot about Japan, even for one
day,'' Tanaka said. ``We looked forward greatly to returning to
Japan, but as Japanese we couldn't leave behind the people we were
fighting alongside for all those years until this opportunity.''
   Tanaka's wife, Haruse, 72, was unable to travel to the airport
because of illness, but she watched her husband's return on
television.
   Several other relatives had flown earlier to Thailand to meet
the men and accompanied them back to Japan.
   ``I never doubted he was still alive but I did not hear from him
or about him for nearly 50 years, so of course I was worried,''
said Hashimoto's sister, Kikuko Ishiwatari, 74.
   Both will be hospitalized for about 10 days for medical
check-ups, a Health and Welfare Ministry official said.
   ``I don't know anything about modern-day Japan,'' Hashimoto told
reporters in a weak voice. ``But I hope to learn as much as
possible and do what I can to help the nation.''
   When Malaya gained its independence from Britain in 1957,
Hashimoto said, ``We could have returned to Japan but it would have
required our surrender to the Malaya government, and we chose not
to do so.''
   He said they decided to fight until the Communist insurgency
ended and they succeeded in establishing a Maoist state. ``But last
year, a peace accord was reached and we became finally free so we
could come back to Japan.''
   His account was interrupted by doctors who cautioned him against
further efforts to speak.
   While in the jungle, the two men reportedly learned of changes
in Japan from a shortwave radio.
   During the insurgency, the Communists fought against British
Commonwealth forces in bloody battles during what was known as the
1948-1960 ``emergency.'' Fighting then continued on a lesser scale.
More recently, Thai-Malaysian military strikes and a Thai amnesty
badly hurt the guerrilla movement, leading to December's peace
agreement.
   Over the years, a number of former Japanese Imperial Army
soldiers have emerged from long periods of isolation in remote
areas of Asia controlled by Japan during World War II.
   The government is investigating the cases of 48 former Japanese
soldiers who could still be alive, according to the Health and
Welfare Ministry.

<HEAD>New Data Casts Doubt About Formation of Stars and Galaxies,
Experts Say</HEAD>

   A satellite designed to detect patterns of
cosmic creation has found nothing to explain how basic structures
in the universe, such as galaxies and stars, came to exist,
researchers said Saturday.
   In a news conference announcing first results from the Cosmic
Background Explorer satellite launched last November, four
scientists said instruments detected none of the patterns of
microwave and infrared radiation that would help to explain how
stars and galaxies started forming shortly after the Big Bang
primordial explosion 15 billion years ago.
   The scientists, presenting their findings on the final day of
the 175th national meeting of the American Astronomical Society,
said the satellite found nothing that would disprove the Big Bang,
but the data did not unravel mysteries of the processes since.
   ``I am completely mystified how the present structures (in the
universe) came to exist without leaving some trace,'' said John
Mather, an astronomer at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Goddard Space Flight Center. He said the finding
adds to the puzzle, but he believes more data from the satellite
may eventually produce a solution.
   ``We have not eliminated our existence yet. We are here,'' he
said. This existence alone, he implied, proves that there was a
process releasing energy after the Big Bang.
   The $150 million COBE satellite, launched Nov. 15, carried into
space for the first time instruments designed to detect microwave
and infrared radiation created shortly after the Big Bang, the
explosion that started formation of the universe.
   It was expected that the three satellite instruments _ one for
microwave and two for infrared _ would find energy traces of the
violent, superheated processes that formed the stars, galaxies,
black holes, quasars and other structures in the universe.
   Current theories are that bits of matter at many points in the
universe formed small centers of gravitational attraction that drew
more and more bits of matter together until the centers became so
dense that stars were born. Once a group of stars were formed,
their mutual attraction, in turn, led to galaxies, and then to
clusters of galaxies, and eventually to structures that form
patterns reaching hundreds of millions of light years across the
sky.
   According to the theories, the tremendous heat from such
processes would produce microwave and infrared radiation, some of
which should still be detectable in the vast reaches of space.
   In order for these models to be correct, however, scientists
expected that COBE would detect ``lumps'' or ``seeds'' _ the
radiation signatures of dense pockets of matter that came together
very early in time.
   Instead, NASA researchers said they so far have found that the
infrared and microwave background is completely ``smooth'' from one
year to 1 million years after the Big Bang, the period in which
star formation is believed to have begun.
   ``We have detected data for a smooth early universe,'' said
George Smoot of the University of California, Berkeley. He said it
was hoped that by studying the fossil radiation from that distant
time, COBE investigators would have answers to what shaped the
current universe, ``but instead we just keep making the problem
worse.''
   ``An infinite universe that is as smooth as a baby's bottom
wouldn't have any way to go,'' said Mather. ``There's got to be a
seed or nucleus to pull things together. We didn't find anything.''
   Michael Hauser of Goddard, the principal investigator on a broad
spectrum infrared instrument designed to look for what he called
``relic radiation of primordial luminous objects'' said it was too
early to draw conclusions.
   All of the COBE investigators emphasized that the current
information is ``very preliminary'' and more readings during the
yearlong life of COBE may change the picture completely.
   But Ned Wright, an astronomer at the University of California,
Los Angeles, said the finding ``rules out any great cataclysmic
events at any time after the Big Bang.''
   Stephan P. Maran, an astronomer associated with NASA's space
telescope project, said the COBE findings ``are not consistent with
those theories on the origin of the large scale structures that we
observe in the universe now.''
   He added: ``This may mean that some new kind of physical
phenomena may have to be recognized as the origin of these
structures, or the theories need to be improved.''
   Nancy Boggess, another member of the COBE science team, said all
instruments on the satellite worked perfectly.
   A NASA statement said the instruments ``are performing
exquisitely with precision never before achieved.''

<HEAD>Deaths Reported in Rampage in Azerbaijani Capital</HEAD>

   Groups of people went on a rampage Saturday night
in the capital of Soviet Azerbaijan, causing an unspecified number
of deaths, the official Tass news agency reported.
   Tass said government and Communist Party authorities in the
Caucasus republic of Azerbaijan called on citizens to aid law
enforcement authorities, indicating the events in the capital of
Baku were serious.
   The latest violence in the ethnically torn southern republic
occurred as President Mikhail S. Gorbachev concluded a three-day
visit to Lithuania in which he failed to turn back the Baltic
republic's independence movement.
   Gorbachev has repeatedly warned that regional independence
movements and ethnic conflicts could doom his political and
economic reform movement.
   Telephone calls from Moscow to Baku, an oil-producing center and
port on the Caspian Sea, did not go through Saturday night, so
independent confirmation of the Tass report was not immediately
possible.
   Tass said ``groups of hooligan elements'' had rampaged in the
city of 1.7 million people. ``Tragic events ensued, there are human
victims,'' it said. Soviet authorities use the phrase ``human
victims'' to refer to deaths.
   The report said authorities had taken steps to restore order in
Baku and that police had arrested people ``suspected of committing
acts of violence.''
   It gave no details.
   Other official reports told of weapons being seized in
Azerbaijan on Saturday and of villages besieged by assailants.
   In another Caucasus republic, Georgia, activists said scattered
strikes continued Saturday to press Communist Party leaders to come
to the republic and consider demands for it to secede from the
Soviet Union. The Georgian capital, Tbilisi, has been the scene of
political rallies for days.
   The violence in Azerbaijan began in 1988 when the mostly Moslem
republic began arguing with neighboring Armenia over who should
govern the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. The enclave is in
Azerbaijan but dominated by Armenians, who are mostly Christians.
   The dispute ignited a virtual civil war between the republics.
   Tass said arms were seized Saturday by police in Stepanakert,
Nagorno-Karabakh's administrative center.
   The cache included two homemade mortars, a machine gun, 17
rifles and dozens of explosive devices, the report said. The
weapons arrived in mail brought to the city aboard a jet from
Yerevan, Armenia's capital, Tass said.
   Elsewhere, ethnic Armenians tried Saturday to surround several
mostly Azerbaijani villages in Nagorno-Karabakh, according to the
Azerbaijani news agency Azerinform.
   The news agency's deputy director, Savili Peretz, said he knew
of no casualties.
   On Friday, Azerbaijanis wearing bulletproof vests and armed with
machine guns caused unspecified casualties in the Armenian village
of Manashid, Tass said.
   The news agency said Friday that Lt. I. Tsymbalyuk of the
Interior Ministry, which is trying to keep order in the region, was
shot and killed in the Azerbaijani village of Akhullu, apparently
by an Azerbaijani policeman.
   Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave of 160,000 people, has been under
Azerbaijani control since 1923. Attempts to annex it to Armenia
spurred unrest that has left about 200 people dead over the last
two years.
   Azerbaijan last week renewed a railroad blockade of Armenia,
which gets most of its supplies through Azerbaijan.
   With fuel and foo in Armenia running dangerously low and
temperatures several degrees below freezing, ``The people are
furious because the central authorities are not paying adequate
attention to events,'' said Eduard Shakh-Nazaryan, an editor at the
government-run Armenpress agency.
   ``This will lead to unpredictable consequences if it
continues,'' he said in a telephone interview from Yerevan. ``I
mean, military conflict between us if they continue like this.''
   Azerbaijani unrest broke out earlier this month as well on the
border with Iran, including in Lenkoran. Azerbaijanis who wanted to
be united with their ethnic brethren across the frontier rampaged
for several days over New Year's, tearing down border fences.
   Soviet-Iranian talks were held Saturday in Moscow and Baku
during a visit by Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi and
Tale Massule, head of the Iranian Foreign Ministry's passports and
visas department.
   Tass said the Iranian representatives agreed to consider Soviet
proposals to facilitate cross-border contacts.

   A bullet whizzed through a kitchen cabinet
and put a 6-inch hole in the ceiling of a woman at home with her
two young sons _ apparently because of a training video being
filmed 1{ miles away, authorities said.
   Kim Robinson and her neighbors were pinned down for nearly two
hours as automatic gunfire ripped through their rural community
Thursday, hitting several mobile homes about an acre apart in
Keysville Estates.
   Several squad cars and a police helicopter responded to
residents' cries for help.
   As Hillsborough County sheriff's Deputy Ron Cain walked around
the Robinson yard, several more rounds landed nearby and Cain
thought he was under attack, Capt. Robert DeLuna said Friday.
   By the time the commotion subsided, police discovered neighbors
and officers had been dodging stray bullets from two out-of-town
businessmen who said they were making a law enforcement training
video at a private gun range 1{ miles away.
   ``It was like being in a war,'' said Mrs. Robinson, whose
children are 3 and 4. ``We didn't know where the bullets were
coming from.''
   The men making the video, Thomas G. Bailey and Steven P. Nelson,
said they had been told there were no homes for at least two miles.
They had an M-16 rifle, a 9mm Heckler and a Koch MP5 assault
weapon, deputies said.
   ``We took all precautions. We had to rely on folks familiar with
the area,'' Nelson said. ``It's unfortunate we were misled.''
   The state attorney's office is reviewing the case, but
prosecutors said no charges were filed immediately because no one
was injured and the stray bullets were apparently unintentional.
   Bailey, who makes training films for a living, and Nelson, a
chiropractor, said they were testing weapons and videotaping them
for evaluation. The tapes are used for training special police
units such as Special Weapons and Tactics teams.
   Darrell Vogel said his mobile home was hit twice.
   ``It put a hole clean through the double-wide _ big enough to
put your little finger through. One put a hole right over my little
boy's desk,'' Vogel said. ``If he had been doing homework, he'd be
dead.''

authorities reported Saturday.
   The thieves broke a window and entered the house late Friday or

$1,200, from the cashbox, the proceeds from sale of books about the

   Da Vinci was born in the house near Florence in northern Italy
in 1452. He died in France in 1519 after producing such works as

<HEAD>East Germans Flock To Stores To Beat Price Hikes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germans went on a frantic shopping spree
Saturday after plans for limited price rises triggered widespread
speculation about further price increases in their economically
troubled nation.
   Also Saturday, East Germany's economics minister became the
highest-ranking government official to urge transforming the
state-controlled economy into a free-market system, something
demanded by potential Western investors.
   The Communist-dominated government said price increases are
needed to begin dismantling the costly and inefficient state
subsidies for dozens of basic goods, including clothing and food.
   Late Friday, the government said prices would double or triple
for children's clothing and related items Monday.
   That triggered a nationwide shopping rush during the four hours
the stores were open Saturday, despite the government's promise to
raise state child support payments in return.
   ``The increased state aid won't cover all of the difference in
prices,'' said one man, his arms loaded with purchases at the
Centrum department store in downtown East Berlin.
   The price increases are aimed mainly at making state-subsidized
goods less attractive to foreigners, who can acquire East German
marks cheaply on the black market and then buy items at a fraction
of the price they would pay in the West.
   East Berlin leaders also have wiped out state subsidies for
flowers, Christmas trees and other plants, while announcing plans
to close ``several'' diplomatic missions abroad.
   Such measures are aimed at cutting a budget deficit of nearly
$1.3 billion.
   East Germans braced for price increases for other essential
goods, including groceries, after hearing reports on West German
radio that such plans were in the works.
   The FDGB labor federation, which has been seeking greater
independence after decades of government control, demanded
negotiations over any further price hikes or reductions in state
subsidies.
   ``We will use all of the labor union means at our disposal to
have a say in this,'' the FDGB said in a statement.
   Economics Minister Christa Luft said East Germany should adopt a
free-market economy as a way out of its economic woes.
   ``It must be an efficient free-market economy that proves itself
to be internationally competitive,'' Mrs. Luft told leading West
German industrialists, including Daimler-Benz chief Edzard Reuter.
   Such an economic system must also take into account social and
environmental concerns, she said.
   A recent series of warning strikes has increased the pressure on
Communist Premier Hans Modrow's shaky coalition government.
   Modrow, during a Cabinet meeting, cautioned about what he sees
as the dangers of the growing number of politically motivated
strikes, according to West Germany's ZDF television network.
   Modrow offered the Social Democratic Party the post of deputy
environmental minister, marking the first time the growing
opposition has been invited to have any direct role in the
government.
   The official news agency ADN said Modrow had offered the job to
Social Democratic leader Ibrahim Boehme, but there was no immediate
word on whether he accepted.
   In a highly symbolic move on Saturday, Boehme's party approved a
modification of its name to adopt the same title as West Germany's
leftist Social Democrats, whose members include popular former
Chancellor Willy Brandt.
   Several prominent West German Social Democrats attended the
session and promised campaign support before East Germany's first
free elections. East Germany's Social Democrats, who claim to have
32,000 members, are expected to be a major force after the May
elections.
   A commentary in Neues Deutschland, the official Communist Party
newspaper, suggested the Communists consider becoming an opposition
force to regain their credibility.
   ``Maybe the (Communist Party) should march out of the government
coalition and into opposition ranks, with clear eyes and an upright
walk,'' the newspaper said. Opposition groups then could ``show
what they can do.''
   With a half-dozen major opposition groups running against the
Communists during the elections, there is a good chance the
Communists will be in a distinct minority anyway in less than four
months.

<TEXT>
   The celebration of Martin Luther King's birthday
may be muted in Miami this year because of the remembrance of three
nights of rioting after the police shooting of an unarmed black
motorcyclist a year ago Tuesday.
   A manslaughter verdict against Miami Police Officer William
Lozano eased animosity slightly in Miami's inner-city black
community.
   But the jury's verdict against the Colombian-born policeman
angered Hispanics, and black leaders say little progress has
occurred in the past year to substantially change problems that
erupted into racial violence four times in the 1980s. They also
worry about the possible reaction to Lozano's sentencing, set for
later this month.
   All of the disturbances were triggered by the deaths of black
men at the hands of police or the subsequent acquittal of those
officers.
   ``We're riot-prone here by virtue of our legacy alone,'' said
Marvin Dunn, a professor and community psychologist.
   ``I don't think that the circumstances that have taken us to the
brink time and time and time again have significantly changed,''
said Dunn, who has written extensively about the 1980 riot. ``Miami
today is just as likely to have a police-community confrontation
erupt into violence as it was a year ago or even 10 years ago.''
   City officials, not surprisingly, paint a more positive picture.
   ``Hopefully, we've outlived these things,'' said Mayor Xavier
Suarez. ``I think there has been a coming together to some extent
of government and the affected neighborhoods.''
   The city was celebrating the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday last
Jan. 16 when Lozano shot at a speeding motorcycle, killing the
driver and sending his passenger to his death in the resulting
crash in the poverty-stricken Overtown neighborhood.
   The deaths of Allan Blanchard and Clement Lloyd led to looting,
sniping and firebombings that left one other man dead, 11 people
injured, 372 arrested, 13 buildings burned and other buildings
damaged.
   Barry Greff, who represents the Lloyd family in a $10 million
wrongful death suit against Lozano and the city, believes the
severity of the sentence to be issued Jan. 24 will dictate
community reaction.
   ``Although the family certainly doesn't advocate it, my
impression is the mood definitely shows the possibility of a
community reaction, a negative community reaction,'' Greff said.
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
went so far as to ask Gov. Bob Martinez to send in the National
Guard to replace Miami police after a handful of officers on the
1,100-member force wore black bands on their badges or wrists to
protest the conviction of a fellow officer.
   Lozano, 31, faces a sentence ranging from probation to 45 years
in prison, with state guidelines recommending 12 to 17 years.
Factors to be considered include on the one hand his high ratings
by the police department before the shooting, but also ``his lack
of remorse,'' prosecutor John Hogan said.
   Rabbi Solomon Schiff, chairman of the Dade County community
relations board, said he expects a peaceful acceptance of the
sentencing because of extensive media attention to the judicial
process, including televising of the entire trial.
   Dunn is less certain because he sees poor police-community
relations as the root of Miami's repetitious violence.
   ``The problem is overzealous, particularly young, inexperienced
officers with a certain attitude toward black youths,'' he said.
   Poverty and alienation in Overtown also are factors, some black
leaders say. The southern edge of the neighborhood, a black
community since 1896, has seen a wealth of construction, including
the $52 million Miami Arena and a $33 million high-rise complex
that displaced 260 families.
   ``Some people believe there's master plan afoot to wipe out
Overtown and put in high-rises,'' said the Rev. Willie Sims, a
Baptist minister and the community relations board's crisis
coordinator.
   ``They're renovating a black community that will no longer be a
black community,'' said Democratic state Rep. Willie Logan of
suburban Opa-locka. ``This isn't going to really benefit the people
who are affected by the riots.''
   Assistant City Manager Herbert Bailey, who is coordinating
downtown redevelopment, resents that attitude as political
posturing.
   ``When you get people who say we're not doing anything, you're
talking to people who don't want to see what is new,'' he said.
``Overtown didn't get that way overnight, and you certainly are not
going to cure it overnight.''
   Bailey concedes there is not much private-sector interest in
rehabilitation of Liberty City, another blighted neighborhood
farther from downtown.
   Psychologist Dunn sees overall improvement in income and
educational levels of Miami blacks, but believes conditions are
worse for the poorest third.
   ``The folks who are most alienated and are most likely to cause
trouble in the streets are folks who are not being touched by these
economic improvements,'' he said.

   President Turgut Ozal cut the flow of
the Euphrates River with the push of a button Saturday, diverting
its waters to a reservoir and raising fears of tension with
Turkey's arid downstream neighbors.
   ``Starting with the name of Allah all-forgiving and for the
benefit of our people,'' Ozal said as he pushed the button at the
end of a cord extending from a channel at the giant Ataturk dam.
   During the one-month stoppage, Syria and Iraq will get 75
percent less water from the tributaries of the Euphrates, the
1,460-mile-long river that has been the lifeblood throughout
history for the area, once ancient Mesopotamia. The river already
slows to become a sluggish stream before joining the Tigris at the
Shatt-al-Arab waterway in Iraq and emptying into the Persian Gulf.
   Commando forces stood guard on heights in the reservoir area
while 10,000 people watched the ceremony at the dam site about 60
miles north of the Syrian border.
   White, blue and pink clouds mushroomed from smoke bombs exploded
on the opposite side of the river during the ceremony, as water
gushed down the middle of the dam's three derivation channels.
   Once the Southeast Anatolia project of 15 dams and 18
hydroelectric power plants is completed, Turkey will have a
stranglehold on both the Euphrates and Tigris rivers.
   But in a speech, Ozal promised Syria and Iraq that ``Turkey
would never use the water of Euphrates as a threat.''
   ``This was a technical necessity but we have taken all possible
care not to cause any damage to our neighbors,'' Ozal said.
   Ozal proposed that Turkey's neighbors invest together in
infrastructure projects as he said European countries had done. He
did not give details.
   Turkey views the dam and a chain of others to be built in the
future as crucial for the economic development of its backward
southeastern region, providing much-needed electricity and water
for crop irrigation.
   It says the monthlong stoppage of water will allow engineers to
fill a reservoir to a height of 396 feet and build a concrete plug
for a diversion channel as part of the construction project.
   Syria is more dependent than Iraq on the river, because Iraq
also has the Tigris running through its territory. But being
upstream, Syria could keep more of the Euphrates waters in its own
reservoirs and allow a trickle to Iraq.
   Syria has made no public statement on the water cut. Iraq said
it would send a senior envoy to Ankara on Sunday to discuss
problems arising from the reduction in the Euphrates flow.
   Iraq sent its deputy foreign minister, Nizar Hamdoun, to Turkey
last month to ask for a cut in the Euphrates flow of two weeks
instead of the planned one month. Turkey said two weeks was not
enough time.
   Hamdoun told reporters that the cutoff would not provoke a
full-blown crisis in Iraqi agriculture, but it would still cause
damage in some areas.
   Turkish officials have taken an Iraqi delegation to the dam
construction site to explain the situation, Foreign Ministry
officials said.
   Turks maintain that since November they have released extra
water to Syria and Iraq, to allow them to store water in their
reservoirs for use during the shortfall.
   A state waterworks official at the dam site said that since
November, Turkey had released 4.42 billion cubic yards of water
downstream, and 1.1 billion cubic yards of it had been allowed into
Iraq by Syria.
   Ozal said the construction of the massive dam by Turkish workers
and engineers showed ``what we are capable of doing.''
   There has been talk in newspapers and diplomatic circles of
possible future strains among the countries of the mostly arid
region since Ozal said last summer in an off-the-cuff remark that
Turkey could block the Euphrates River waters to punish Syria for
providing support to Kurdish guerrillas waging war for independence
in southeast Turkey.
   When completed in 2006, the Southeast Anatolia project will
produce 22 billion kwh of electricity annually and irrigate an area
of 4 million acres.
   The additional energy should double the yield of many crops in
Turkey and produce $5 billion worth of surplus in the country,
which is agriculturally self-sufficient, officials say.
   The first of the Ataturk dam's eight electricity-generating
units is scheduled to go into operation May 1991.

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist authorities Saturday
banned a new Serbian independent political group and denounced its
program as nationalist, the Tanjug news agency reported.
   The name of the group is Society for the Preservation of
Historical Truth, the Serbian Language, The Cyrillic (alphabet) and
for the Defense of Kosovo.
   Its chairman, Mirko Jovic, was briefly detained Friday in Nova
Pazova, 18 miles northwest of Belgrade, and its leaders were
harassed by police, the group's sources said.
   Authorities said they banned the society because it ``abused the
constitutionally guaranteed freedom of association ... and fomented
Yugoslav nationalist hatred and intolerance and (called for the)
toppling of the foundations of the socialist self-managed,
democratic system.''
   Group representatives said a week ago they were planning to
formally constitute themselves as a Party of Serbian National
Renewal on Jan. 27.
   Vuk Draskovic, a member of the newly formed party's leadership
and prominent Serbian writer, said Friday he and Jovic had received
threats after they announced their plans to form a political party.
   Yugoslav state-run media have launched a campaign against the
group, accusing it of advocating nationalism and bloodshed with
other Yugoslav nationalities, especially with the Croats.
   Draskovic denied that his party is nationalist and said the
campaign represents ``an organized hysteria by Serbian Communists
and their leadership.''
   Even though Yugoslavia has not formally adopted a law allowing
independent political groups and parties to form, numerous such
groups have mushroomed in the past few months.
   Communist authorities claim some of the new parties have clear
nationalist programs leading to open clashes between rival Yugoslav
republics.

   Soviet Moslems who have demonstrated
violently for the right to travel freely to Iran received good news
Saturday from the Iranian foreign minister, who said they are
welcome to visit his country.
   The minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, made the announcent in Tabriz,
the capital of Iran's East Azerbaijan province, where he helped
complete travel arrangements for Soviet Moslems, the official
Iranian news agency said.
   The news report, which was monitored in Nicosia, did not say
when the first Soviet visitors were expected in Iran.
   The province borders Soviet Azerbaijan, which was once part of
Iran.
   Earlier this month, Soviet Azerbaijanis who want to be united
with their Iranian brethren rampaged for several days, tearing down
border fences.
   Soviet-Iranian talks were held Saturday in Moscow and Baku, the
capital of Soviet Azerbaijan, during a visit by Iranian Deputy
Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi and Tale Massule, head of Iran's
passports and visas department.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said the Iranian officials agreed to
consider Soviet proposals to facilitate cross-border contacts and
to receive a Soviet delegation in Tehran later this month, possibly
to sign travel agreements.
   The Soviet and Iranian Azerbaijani republics share a common
language, culture and religion. They are demanding an open border
and freedom to trade and cross the frontier. Following the border
unrest, the Soviet Foreign Ministry said restrictions on travel to
Iran would be eased.
   Azerbaijan was divided in 1828. In 1941, the Red Army invaded
northern Iran and set up a short-lived puppet republic after World
War II. But the Soviets pulled out in 1946 because of international
pressure.
   For the last two years, Soviet Azerbaijan also has been involved
in a violent dispute with the neighboring Soviet republic of
Armenia over an enclave in Azerbaijan they both claim the right to
govern.

<HEAD>Couple With Taste for High Living Sentenced in Fraud Scheme</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A high-living Northern Virginia couple
who lured consumers to visit time-share resorts with false promises
of expensive prizes was sentenced to prison for bankruptcy fraud
and money laundering.
   U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton on Friday sentenced David A.
DeFusco, 34, of Great Falls to five years in prison and his wife,
Annette, 28, to 35 months.
   The DeFuscos hid large sums of money by laundering funds through
fake corporations rather than tone down their gourmet lifestyle and
pay off $2.5 million in debts, U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson said.
   Hudson said the couple fled Northern Virginia in March 1989,
leaving behind nearly 100 creditors in the Washington area as well
as a stack of lawsuits and consumer fraud complaints. Their flight
came shortly before bankruptcy officials acted to seize their
assets.
   They later were discovered in California, living in a haven for
millionaires outside San Diego and operating a business similar to
one that brought on a barrage of consumer complaints here.
   Hudson said the DeFuscos received up to $100 each for potential
customers they lured to visit time-share condominium resorts with
promises of nonexistent gifts, such as BMW cars and gold bullion.
   David DeFusco in October pleaded guilty in Beaumont, Texas, to
mail fraud and conspiracy charges and is awaiting sentencing there.
   Under a court agreement, he will spend an additional 70 months
to 87 months in jail for organizing what prosecutors said was a
$720 billion fraud scheme.
   Prosecutors arrived at that figure by multiplying the average
$34,000 prize offering times the 24 million pieces of mail
delivered during the scheme.
   A business he operated in Washington state also has been the
target of an investigation in recent years.
   Before sentencing, DeFusco said his success as measured by
opulent jewelry and luxury cars was the product of ``what we still
believe were legitimate business practices.'' Prosecutors rejected
that notion.
   ``These people lived a lavish lifestyle at the expense of many
consumers and many other creditors,'' Hudson said.
   In the Virginia case, the DeFuscos pleaded guilty on Oct. 20.
Prosecutors said the couple used phantom corporations and aliases
to hide money frozen in bankruptcy proceedings from creditors who
claimed unpaid debts of $2.5 million from the DeFuscos and their
companies.
   After a bankruptcy trustee ordered liquidation of their assets
last spring, the couple sold two cars and moved $250,000 worth of
personal possessions to California and opened their new business
under assumed names, authorities said.
   FBI agents who raided their Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., home on
July 5 found jewelry, furs, a Persian Rug worth $15,000 and art
work valued at more than $10,000.
   DeFusco admitted diverting $1 million worth of corporate and
personal assets that had been frozen by a bankruptcy trustee.
   Mrs. DeFusco admitted diverting $290,000 worth of assets as part
of the scheme with her husband.

reign over two of the most popular Mardi Gras parades next month.
   Goodman, who plays Roseanne Barr's husband on the ABC show
``Roseanne,'' will be grand marshal of the Krewe of Endymion on
Feb. 24. Quaid, who burned up the keyboards as Jerry Lee Lewis in
the film ``Great Balls of Fire,'' will be Bacchus the next day,
carnival officials said Friday. Mardi Gras is Feb. 27.
   Both have several ties to Louisiana. The two starred in the 1987
police thriller ``The Big Easy,'' set in New Orleans, and
``Everybody's All-American,'' a 1988 film shot in Baton Rouge.
   Goodman was married in New Orleans on Oct. 27 to Bogalusa native

   Former Boston Celtics star Dave Cowens found that
becoming a Republican may have fouled up his chances of running for
secretary of state.
   Cowens, 41, director of the New England Sports Museum and a
Democrat until last month, put the word out to Republican Party
leaders Friday that he would run for office.
   But the former center and player-coach was unaware of a state
law that says a candidate for statewide office in one party cannot
have been enrolled in another political party during the year prior
to the filing deadline.
   Cowens switched his registration Dec. 8. The filing deadline for
secretary of state is June 5.
   ``He got caught traveling,'' said Paul McCarthy, the only
Republican candidate for secretary of state to have filed thus far.
   Cowens' only option may be to run as a write-in candidate,
something he said he would consider. Some Republicans said Cowens
could become their candidate if McCarthy stepped aside and no other
Republican ran.
   But McCarthy said, ``I'm committed to the race, no matter how
tall my opponent is. I'll fight him into the state convention March
10, and maybe I'll slam-dunk him.''
   Responded Cowens: ``A lot of people have tried.''

   Grand Ole Opry star Jeanne Pruitt says
her farm will be disturbed by a planned interstate highway.
   ``It will come right through the collard green patch,'' she said.
   Pruitt, best known for her hit song ``Satin Sheets,'' learned
Friday that Interstate 840 will cross her 160-acre farm south of
Nashville, isolating 40 to 60 acres of the property.
   ``I'm sorry that's where it has to come, but if it's got to go
somewhere, it's got to go,'' she said, adding that she might sell
the land for a more secluded location.
   The 53-mile stretch of interstate is designed to ease Nashville
traffic by offering a southern bypass off Interstate 40.
Construction should be completed by the end of the decade.

   Comedian David Letterman didn't gain
a new fan by having 78-year-old Gabriel Raba as a guest on his
late-night talk show.
   ``He's a silly guy,'' said the New Underwood rancher, who
appeared on NBC-TV's ``Late Night With David Letterman'' Tuesday to
discuss a 13-month calendar he created and had copyrighted. ``He
never clearly showed the calendar. He had it in his hand and was
flipping it around.''
   Raba said he was more amused by the pre-show preparations than
Letterman's on-the-air wisecracks.
   ``A girl even danced with me to keep me from getting nervous,''
he said. ``And they put makeup powder on me, just like a lady.''
   Raba's idea would bring order to the current calendar, which has
months with 28, 29, 30 or 31 days. His calendar would have 13
months, each with 28 days for a total of 364. He's soliciting
suggestions for what to call the 13th month.
   To keep the revised calendar in sync with the 365-day year, Raba
would have a 48-hour New Year's Day and a 48-hour Leap Year day.
   ``You should have heard them clap and whoop and holler when I
mentioned the 48-hour New Year's and Leap Year,'' Raba said of the
New York studio audience.

   Air Force officials are calling for retirement
of all 450 of the nation's Minuteman 2 intercontinental ballistic
missiles in a move to save $400 million a year, according to a
published report.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has received the green light to
discuss the proposal with congressional leaders this week before
any final decision, The Washington Post reported in Saturday's
editions.
   An Air Force spokesman, Col. Patrick Maloney, said Saturday when
asked about the plan that the service does not discuss budget
proposals until the budget becomes final.
   The Post quoted officials as cautioning that President Bush
might veto the idea before unveiling his fiscal 1991 budget to
Congress on Jan. 29.
   In another cost-cutting move, Cheney on Friday froze civilian
hirings at the Defense Department, saying it was made possible by
eased world tensions.
   Department officials, however, said they did not know how much
the work force will be reduced by the freeze.
   The freeze lasts until Sept. 30 and applies to all Defense
Department civilians worldwide, including part-time and temporary
employees. The department currently employs 927,000 civilians
full-time and another 123,000 on a temporary or part-time basis.
   Up to 80,000 workers retire or otherwise leave that work force
each year, the Pentagon said.
   The Minuteman 2 carries a single warhead with an explosive force
estimated at 1.2 megatons, or the equivalent of 1.2 million tons of
TNT. The missiles are based at Malmstrom Air Force Base, Mont.;
Ellsworth Air Force Base, S.D., and Whiteman Air Force Base, Mo.,
   The Minuteman 2 is relatively inaccurate compared with later
missiles. Published estimates say half the missiles launched would
land within 1,200 feet to 2,000 feet of the point of aim.
   Similar estimates for the 550 deployed Minuteman 3 missiles,
which carry three smaller warheads, are from 600 feet to 700 feet.
   Besides the Minuteman, the nation's land-based missiles include
50 MX Peacekeeper missiles with 10 warheads each. Counting other
missiles and bombs, the Minuteman 2 force represents about 3.5
percent of the nation's strategic nuclear warheads.
   The Bush administration has proposed building a new Midgetman
single-warhead missile that could be moved about on giant trucks.
Midgetman proponents say the mobile missiles would be much more
difficult to hit than known, fixed positions such as current
Minuteman silos.
   Because they are old and inaccurate, the Minuteman 2 missiles
have been candidates for retirement for some time. The
administration told Congress last summer that a likely strategic
nuclear arms treaty with the Soviet Union would mean significant
reductions in missiles on both sides.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said
Saturday he no longer objects to the legalization of multiple
political parties in the Soviet Union, where his Communist Party
has held a monopoly on power for 72 years.
   ``I see no tragedy in a multiparty system if _ and I can tell
you this straightforwardly _ it arises as a result of a normal
historical process and answers the needs of society,'' Gorbachev
told Lithuania's Communist Party.
   It was a surprising reversal by Gorbachev, who had remained
opposed to the idea of rival political parties, even as
pro-democracy movements forced an end to one-party Communist rule
elsewhere in Eastern Europe.
   Soviet police routinely have broken up demonstrations by the
Democratic Union _ until recently the only Soviet organization
trying to establish itself as an opposition party.
   A reason for Gorbachev's turnaround could be that multiparty
systems already exist in Lithuania and Latvia. The party ideology
chief in the third Baltic republic, Estonia, has said the same is
inevitable there.
   Lithuania was the first to legalize other political parties, and
Lithuanian Communists will face them in February elections to the
Lithuanian parliament.
   Gorbachev came to the Baltic republic in an effort to persuade
the Lithuanian Communist Party to reverse its decision last month
to break with the central Communist Party.
   The three-day visit ended with the Lithuanians refusing to
budge. The president concluded Saturday's party meeting with the
statement, ``We have laid a good foundation for continuing the
dialogue.'' He then returned to Moscow.
   Gorbachev pleaded for unity in both the party and the Soviet
Union but faced pro-independence demonstrators at every stop and
clearly had no significant effect on public opinion.
   Lithuanians strongly support independence for the republic,
which was forcibly annexed in 1940 while occupied by the Red Army.
   The Communist Party ideology chief, Vadim A. Medvedev, told a
news conference after the meeting that elaboration on Gorbachev's
statement on multiple parties will be contained in an article
written by Gorbachev and due to appear in the Soviet press,
possibly as early as Sunday.
   Communists have held exclusive power in the Soviet Union since a
few months after the 1917 Russian Revolution. A number of parties
operated in the last years of the czar's reign but had little
power, and a number competed for control during the turbulent year
of revolution itself.
   Gorbachev's statement was the first indication the Soviet Union
might catch up with the wave of political reform that has been
sweeping Eastern Europe in recent months.
   Poland, East Germany, Hungary and Romania have all eliminated
the Communists' guaranteed hold on political power and either
formed multiparty systems or scheduled free elections.
   Gorbachev has made clear his willingness to end the Communists'
legal guarantee on political power, codified in the Soviet
Constitution, but until now, he expressed scorn for a multiparty
system.
   On Friday, he told an audience in Siauliai, Lithuania: ``Haven't
you and I seen and known during our long life that even with 10 or
20 parties, the most cruel dictatorships formed and flourished?
   ``And will a multiparty system save society? No, it is the
regime that determines who lives how and who breathes how.''
   Gorbachev's reversal was his second surprising announcement on
the Lithuanian tour. On Thursday, he said a law was being drafted
to set up a mechanism for republics to secede from the Soviet Union.
   He promised that the Lithuanian people would be allowed to
choose their own fate and predicted they would remain in the union
once they realize the financial costs and human dislocation that
secession would cause.
   In a long speech to the Lithuanian Communists, Gorbachev said
separatists were in too much of a hurry.
   ``Think a thousand times before embarking on an independent
drift without a compass, without a map, a fuel reserve or a
competent crew,'' he said.
   In a lecturing tone, Gorbachev also warned: ``There is no
absolute freedom, and you won't find absolute independence
anywhere... Everything in the world is interrelated.''
   Lithuanian Communist Party chief Algirdas Brazauskas said in his
speech that events forced his party to split with the national
Communist Party.
   ``Comprehensive analysis of the political situation throughout
the republic convinced us that only an independent Communist Party
could hold the trust of the residents of Lithuania, and only on
that basis could it remain a serious political force,'' he said.
   In the end, Gorbachev invited the breakaway Lithuanians to the
next national party congress in October, implying the meeting might
adopt enough reforms to bring them back into the fold.
   The invitation might be to Gorbachev's advantage, since the
Lithuanians are likely to back him against conservative opponents
in the congress.

   Winning $10 million in sweepstakes money
wasn't enough for Bob Castleberry. Now he's out to be mayor of this
town of 50,000.
   ``I had thought about it for years,'' Castleberry said Friday.
``I grew up watching my father giving everything to the community.
Now I just want to do what I can.''
   Castleberry, 60, announced Thursday that he is entering the race
for mayor of Denton, a town of 50,000. His father served on the
City Council from 1929-30 and then again in the early 1950s.
   Castleberry attracted attention last March after winning $10
million in the Publishers Clearing House Sweepstakes. He retired
from his sales job at Moore Business Forms in Denton this month.
   ``I knew I couldn't do both jobs justice,'' he said. ``One job
would have suffered.''
   Two-term incumbent Mayor Ray Stephens has not yet announced his
intentions for the campaign. The election for the non-paying job is
May 5.
   Castleberry said as a result of his appearances in commercials
for the magazine subscription service, he's gaining valuable
exposure with potential voters.
   He also gets lots of phone calls and letters from women with
marriage in mind, but he doesn't pay much attention to them.
   The money is coming in annual payments. He got $500,000 last

In the final year, when he is 90, he will get a lump sum payment of
about $2 million.
   ``I plan to live to be at least 100,'' he said.
   Castleberry has used the money to set up scholarships at Texas
A&amp;M University, the University of North Texas and Texas Woman's
University and to buy a $32,000 automobile. He wants to buy a small
horse ranch, but hasn't found what he wants so far.

   L. Douglas Wilder became the nation's first
elected black governor Saturday and said his inauguration at the
spot where the Confederacy collapsed almost 125 years ago shows
``oppression can be lifted.''
   ``We mark today not the victory of party or the accomplishments
of an individual, but the triumph of an idea,'' Wilder said in his
inaugural address outside the Virginia Capitol, which was capital
of the Confederacy in the Civil War. ``The idea that all men are
created equally.''
   Wilder, a lawyer and Democratic former legislator and lieutenant
governor who turns 59 Wednesday, took the oath of office from
retired U.S. Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., a Richmond
native who headed the city's school board during the period of
resistance to school integration.
   Wilder, who is divorced, was flanked by his two daughters and
son as he took the oath. A largely black crowd estimated by police
at more than 35,000 was more than double attendance at the 1985
inauguration.
   Wilder said his inauguration represents a triumph for ideals
expressed in the Declaration of Independence by Thomas Jefferson, a
Virginia governor during the Revolutionary War.
   ``If these words about freedom are to be heard at all today, I
hope they will be heard by the young people of this commonwealth,'
Wilder said.
   ``I want them to know that oppression can be lifted, that
discrimination can be eliminated, that poverty need not be binding,
that disability can be overcome,'' he said.
   ``And the offer of opportunity in a free society carries with it
the responsibility of hard work, the rejection of drugs and other
false highs, and a willingness to work with others whatever their
color or national origin,'' he continued.
   Cheers interrupted Wilder's 15-minute address five times, once
when he proclaimed ``freedom is meaningless when a woman's right to
choose is regulated outside the dictates of her own faith and
conscience.''
   Wilder's support of abortion rights was a prominent issue in his
fiercely fought campaign against Republican J. Marshall Coleman,
who opposes abortion. A recount showed that Coleman lost by 6,741
votes, or less than half a percent, in the closest race for
governor in the state's history.
   Wilder became the state's 66th governor and the first black to
be elected governor in any state. Black Lt. Gov. P.B.S. Pinchback
served as Louisiana governor for 43 days in late 1872 and early
1873 after the elected governor was impeached.
   Music for the inaugural ceremony included ``God Bless America''
and ``America the Beautiful.'' But not a note was heard of the
state's official song, ``Carry Me Back to Old Virginia.'' As a
freshman state senator in 1970, Wilder sought to have the song
abolished because its lyrics contain the word ``darkies.''
   The inauguration was preceded by a prayer service and the
ceremonial presentation of the keys to the Executive Mansion by
outgoing Democratic Gov. Gerald L. Baliles.
   Jesse Jackson and former tennis star Arthur Ashe, a Richmond
native, attended the prayer service. Wilder hadn't let Jackson
campaign on his behalf, but Wilder's press secretary, Laura
Dillard, said Jackson was invited to the inauguration because
``it's appropriate. He's a leading national figure in Democratic
circles.''
   Jackson described the inauguration as a historic moment.
   ``To go from the hull of a slave ship to governor is a great
American story,'' he said. ``It's a great world story.''
   Wilder said an economic slowdown would challenge his
administration ``but progress will be possible.''
   ``Resources employed in the past for the finer things in life
can be _ and will have to be _ deployed for the more serious of our
needs. For we know that freedom is but a word for the man or woman
who needs and cannot find a job.''
   Wilder said he will tell the state legislature on Monday his
ideas for handling the state's projected $900 million revenue
shortfall over the next two years.
   The weekend, however, was devoted to celebrating his
inauguration with a parade, public reception and inaugural ball.
   About 12,500 tickets costing $50 or more were sold for the ball
at the Richmond Coliseum. A protest sign at the inauguration,
referring to the largely poor neighborhood in Richmond where Wilder
grew up, read: ``Is there a ball for Church Hill?''
   ``The eyes of the nation are on Virginia,'' said Mildred Swann,
a Hampton social services worker in her 40s. During her four-hour
wait for the ceremony to begin, she recalled how she evaded Klan
gunfire as she tried to get fellow blacks in Mississippi to
register to vote in the early 1960s.
   ``For me to see something like this in my lifetime _ there's
some hope for the world,'' she said. When Wilder was introduced,
she bowed her head and cried.

<HEAD>Official: Thousands of Palestinians Leaving Territories</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMAL HALABY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Palestinians are migrating from the
Israeli-occupied territories in increasing numbers, with about
24,000 leaving the rebellion-wracked lands last year alone to live
in Jordan, an official said Saturday.
   Mohammed Al-Edwan, head of the Interior Ministry's department of
inspection and control, said ministry figures show that more than
45,600 Palestinians have left the Israeli-occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip to live in Jordan since 1983.
   He said the figures are ``increasing day after day and month
after month.''
   More than half of the 45,600 who have left since 1983 left in
the past two years, since the beginning of the Palestinian uprising
against Israeli occupation.
   There are about 1.7 million Palestinians now living in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. Hardships have greatly increased since the
uprising began.
   Ministry figures show that about 22,000 Palestinians migrated
from the territories in the first 11 months of 1989, Edwan said. He
estimated that about 2,000 more left in December.
   Edwan said those figures exclude students studying abroad and
those who left for pressing personal reasons like illness.
   Travel to the West Bank was unrestricted until 1967, when Israel
captured the territory from Jordan in the Middle East war. Many
West Bankers have close family and business ties to Jordan.
   About half of Jordan's 3 million people come from Palestinian
families who fled or were driven from their homes during wars with
Israel.
   Interior Minister Salem Masadeh said he was not familiar with
the figures, but that if they were true, ``it would be the cause of
much sorrow.''
   In a related development, the Parliament confirmed Saturday an
earlier government decision abolishing the Ministry of Occupied
Territories, with only two votes against the move.
   The government dismantled the ministry to put into effect King
Hussein's 1988 decision renouncing claims to the West Bank in favor
of the Palestine Liberation Organization. The PLO has declared an
independent state of Palestine, challenging Israeli occupation.
   The PLO's equivalent of a foreign minister, Farouk Kadoumi,
ended a four-day visit to Jordan on Saturday and lashed out at
Israeli Cabinet minister Ariel Sharon for describing Jordan as a
substitute homeland for Palestinians.
   ``Sharon is a terrorist, and his statement was condemned by the
different political circles, including those friendly to Israel,''
Kadoumi said in a departure statement carried by Jordan's official
Petra news agency.
   The right-wing Israeli official suggested Thursday that Jordan
should open its borders with Israel, despite the technical state of
war between them.
   ``Jews would be able to travel to Jordan...and the Jordanians
will be able to visit Tel Aviv,'' he told Israel television.
   On Friday, he told Israel radio that such a move would help the
peace process, adding: ``I repeat, Jordan is a Palestinian state.''
   Sharon and some other Israeli hard-liners favor permanent
Israeli rule over the West Bank and Gaza.

   ``We want to make one thing very clear: that this is only one
phase of the investigation, which has been carried out so that the
truth may be known. It is the duty of judicial authorities to carry
the process to its conclusion, so that, in accordance with the laws

in a nationally broadcast radio and television address.
   Benavides is the director of the Gerardo Barrios Military
College. He was until late last year head of the intelligence
section of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   The other officers implicated by Cristiani are Lt. Yuzi Mendoza,
Lt. Jose Espinosa Guerra and 2nd Lt. Gonzalo Guevara. The officers
are members of the elite Atlacatl infantry battalion.

   President Ion Iliescu on Saturday
reversed a decision to ban the Communist Party, calling it a
``hasty decision,'' and instead said the issue will be decided in a
national referendum.
   Iliescu responded to widespread protests Friday by announcing
that the Communist Party, the sole ruler of Romania from 1948 until
last month, had been outlawed.
   In a nationwide television and radio broadcast, Iliescu said the
governing National Salvation Front had been criticized for the
action, and he said the people will decide the fate of the
Communists in a Jan. 28 referendum.
   ``It was a hasty decision, contrary to the democratic spirit,''
Iliescu said of Friday's announcement.
   Iliescu complained that popular pressures had even led some
Front members to consider resigning.
   ``Then we realized that in this way, we would leave an open road
to anarchy and chaos in the country. which would be a genuine
national disaster,'' said Iliescu, who took office after the
popular revolution that ousted Ceausescu. ``We need the massive
support of the whole country.''
   ``The Communist Party self-destructed or was removed from
political life on Dec. 22,'' he added, referring to the day
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was overthrown.
   ``The Front is against any leading role of any party. We are in
a dramatic moment because we inherited an extremely difficult
decision from the dictatorship. We need patience, wisdom and
unity,'' he said.
   The Jan. 28 referendum also will include the question of whether
to reinstitute the death penalty, which was abolished by the
revolutionary leadership after the executions of Ceausescu and his
wife, Elena.
   There have been nationwide calls to bring back the death penalty
by those who feel life imprisonment is too lenient a punishment for
crimes committed by Ceausescu cronies as well as by members of the
Securitate, Ceausescu's dreaded special police.
   Police said 11 Securitate members will stand trial Monday in
Timisoara, the birthplace of the revolution, where street protests
of official foot-dragging led the army to assume control Friday
night.
   The army controlled the city, the birthplace of Romania's
revolution, on Saturday after local leaders were forced to resign
amid street protests demanding the ouster of Communists from the
revolutionary government.
   The army takeover apparently was an administrative measure and
did not mean the region was under martial law. The army's support
was crucial to Ceausescu's overthrow.
   Shooting continued until Friday in Timisoara and the city of
Arad near the Hungarian border, between army units and members of
Ceausescu's Securitate, the Yugoslav state news agency Tanjug
reported.
   Thousands of people took to the streets on Friday in Bucharest,
Timisoara and Brasov to demand reinstatement of the death penalty
for Securitate members and to protest the participation of
Communists in the interim government.
   No demonstrations were reported in Romania on Saturday.
   Lorin Fortuna, the leader of Timisoara's local National
Salvation Front council, resigned after demonstrators complained
the council was doing nothing about Securitate forces being held,
according to a police official who identified himself only as Capt.
Streza.
   The Securitate defendants to be tried in public on Monday in
response to the popular pressure include a general, whom Streza did
not name.
   The army took power to guarantee law and order and uninterrupted
municipal services until elections planned by Jan. 19, Streza said
in a telephone interview, quoting Maj. Gen. Gheorghe Popescu,
commander of the armed forces in Timis county. The county's chief
city is Timisoara.
   A new administrative council will be elected by representatives
of factories and other organizations and institutions within the
region, according to a Tanjug report.
   All leading members of Romania's Communist Party are under
arrest for investigation of their role in the regime run with an
iron hand by Ceausescu, who was overthrown Dec. 22 and executed
Christmas Day.
   The Ceausescus' three-hour trial at an undisclosed location 60
miles from Bucharest was described Saturday in the newspaper
Libertatea, which carried an interview with Niki Tedorescu, whom it
identified as their attorney.
   ``They refused any cooperation with us. They did not understand
what we said,'' Tedorescu recalled. ``Ceausescu kept repeating that
he did not recognize the tribunal.''
   ``They denied they had any property, or any luxury property,''
said Tedorescu, who was interviewed at a military hospital where he
was recovering from a bullet wound received in the fighting in
Bucharest.
   After his overthrow, Romanian media reported the feudal splendor
in which the Ceausescu family lived while their countrymen did
without the most basic commodities.
   ``I didn't expect them to be so uneducated,'' Tedorescu said.
``Both of them, but especially her (Mrs. Ceausescu), were
disobeying all the laws of grammar.''
   Mrs. Ceausescu was touted by the regime as a key intellectual
with major scientific achievements. Officially, she held a
doctorate in chemistry.
   ``I was surprised they looked so well, even in the state they
were in, trembling with fear. I thought that in spite of their age,
they looked better than me, and I am much younger.''
   Asked his last words to Ceausescu after the death sentence was
passed, Tedorescu answered:
   ``According to the law, I asked him if he objected to the
(death) sentence, and he indicated no. He was convinced in my
opinion that he would not be executed.''
   The Ceausescus were executed shortly after the trial.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's dropping of his
staunch opposition to one-party Communist rule is a logical
extension of his drive to permit broader expression of views and
competitive elections for public office.
   But while Gorbachev's statement Saturday that he can ``see no
tragedy in a multiparty system'' constitutes a recognition of
existing political reality in some Soviet republics, it could spawn
fractious, ethnic-oriented parties with little concern for the
union.
   And, of course, it may eventually doom the 70-year-old Communist
political apparatus that operates parallel to _ and wields more
power than _ the government at all levels of Soviet society.
   The Kremlin's Eastern European allies have challenged their own
Communist leaders in recent months, and those countries have moved
far away from the monopolies that used to be held by the ruling
political cliques.
   But in the Soviet Union, where the first democratic reforms
began nearly five years ago, Gorbachev and the top leadership have
steadfastly refused to relinquish the party's position as the only
legally recognized political entity.
   Members of the Democratic Union, a tiny but outspoken group that
brazenly calls itself an opposition party, have been routinely
subjected to detention, arrest and even beatings by authorities,
who have learned to tolerate many other forms of dissent.
   Since the Communists obliterated their political opposition in
the first years after the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, the ruling
party has controlled not just the political sphere but all walks of
life. Party membership was a prerequisite to professional
advancement. Party officials determined what children were taught,
what people could read and where they could work.
   The party, now 20 million strong, also served as a strong
unifying force, bringing together and exercising power over the
more than 100 nationalities and ethnic groups that make up the vast
Soviet Union.
   Opponents of multiparty rule have suggested that if the
Communist monopoly were broken, the union would disintegrate into
dozens of parochial parties playing for the support of the narrow
ethnic groups that concentrate in each republic and region.
   The opposing interests of those groups are at the heart of much
of the unrest that has shaken the country for two years.
   As recently as Friday, only a day before conceding he would be
willing to tolerate other political parties, Gorbachev was warning
of the hazards of such a system, and arguing that the Communist
Party could serve as a forum for multiple views.
   ``Haven't you and I seen and known during our long life that
even with 10 or 20 parties the most cruel dictatorships formed and
flourished?'' he asked during a visit to a collective farm in
independence-minded Lithuania.
   ``And will a multiparty system save society? No, it is the
regime that determines who lives how and who breathes how.''
   ``Just look,'' he added, ``with only one Communist Party of the
Soviet Union how many opinions we have! And how much plurality,
democracy under a one-party system. How many public movements ... I
welcome it.''
   But de facto, Lithuania already has at least two political
parties vying for official recognition.
   One, referred to as the independent Communist Party of
Lithuania, is the majority party in the republic that voted to
break with Moscow and pursue its own course, prompting the visit of
Gorbachev and other party leaders in an unsuccessful attempt to
mend the break.
   The other, calling itself the Communist Party of Lithuania
(Platform CPSU), is made up of party stalwarts still loyal to
Moscow who left the republic's party and set up their own
contingent that continues to follow the platform of the Soviet
Communist Party.
   In other republics, local popular front groups have fielded
candidates for legislative posts in opposition to Communists, and
in Latvia on Saturday, about 200 environmental activists announced
the formation of a Greens party with goals similar to those of the
Greens in Western Europe.
   In Estonia, Social Democrats from several European countries
held an international conference sponsored by the Social Democratic
political organization in that Baltic republic.
   Gorbachev, who last May was elected to a five-year term as
president but whose real power still resides in his leadership of
the party _ which has no certain tenure _ refused during the
Congress of People's Deputies session last month to permit the body
to consider revoking the party's constitutional monopoly on power.
   And he has been quick to put down the Congress' fledgling and
loosely knit opposition, which calls itself the Inter-regional
Group.
   But the Kremlin chief is by his own account a political realist,
and his comments Saturday reflected more an acknowledgement of the
political forces at work than an endorsement of the concept.
   ``I see no tragedy in a multiparty system _ and I can tell you
this straightforwardly _ if it arises as a result of a normal
historical process and answers the needs of society,'' he said.
``We shouldn't be afraid of a multiparty system the way the devil
fears incense.
   ``Still, a multiparty system is no panacea. What we really need
is glasnost and democratization and genuine participation of the
people.''

<HEAD>Thousands Rally In Ambulance Worker Pay Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of ambulance workers and their
backers rallied with banners and a brass band Saturday to support
pay demands of the emergency crews in an 18-week-old dispute with
the government.
   London ambulance workers, who earn $16,906 a year after five
years at work, began job actions more than four months ago. They
were suspended on Nov. 8 and replaced by police and military staff
when they decided not to respond to non-emergency calls.
   Although management stopped putting emergency calls through to
the ambulance workers, in many cases the depots remained staffed
and unpaid crews responded to such calls from hospitals or fire
stations.
   The pay dispute spread through the country, and on Thursday 60
workers in West Sussex county, south of London, went on unofficial
strike.
   The death of a man in that district Saturday received wide news
coverage when it was announced it had taken 31 minutes for a fully
equipped ambulance to reach him.
   An estimated 15,000 ambulance crew members and their families
marched Saturday along Whitehall and into Trafalgar Square to
cheers and applause from crowds estimated at 15,000 or more.
   The march, which included banners, a brass band and young
children, lent a carnival atmosphere to the government center of
the capital.
   A police inspector said it was one of the biggest rallies held
in London for many years. ``We could not fit everyone into the
square, so people are packed onto surrounding pavements,'' he said.
   Ambulance workers have demanded an 11 percent raise and a pay
formula like those of police and firemen, guaranteeing automatic
raises. The government has offered an increase of 9 percent over 18
months, but it says it won't accept the pay formula.

<HEAD>Reputation for Arms Deals Drew IRA to South Florida, Officials

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four suspected Irish Republican Army guerrillas
accused of trying to buy a Stinger missile in an undercover sting
may have been attracted to south Florida by its reputation for arms
deals, federal officials suggested.
   The sting that began last fall culminated in the arrests Friday
of three Irishmen and a Canadian on arms charges.
   All four were being held without bond Saturday at the Palm Beach
County Jail, and were to be arraigned Tuesday before a U.S.
magistrate in West Palm Beach.
   The region has never been known for a significant IRA presence.
But it usually leads the nation in gun cases, said Bruce Snyder, a
spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Alchohol, Tobacco and Firearms in
Miami.
   ``Traditionally, we are the No. 1 area,'' especially for machine
guns and other high-powered weapons, Snyder said.
   Although the Miami area has its share of international intrigue
involving Latin America, other U.S. cities such as New York, Boston
and San Francisco have reputations as sympathetic havens for IRA
members and fund-raising.
   Last July 12, authorities arrested three IRA ``technical
experts'' in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Pennyslvania and
seized radar and missile parts.
   ``This is the first one I remember in south Florida, and I've
been here since 1969,'' Snyder said. ``This is the first one we've
had with the IRA.''
   The investigation by the ATF, the FBI and the Customs Service
began in late October after agents received reports that the men,
three of whom lived together at a trailer park in Riviera Beach
near Palm Beach, were looking to buy weapons, agents said.
   ``South Florida certainly has a reputation as a place where
weapons can be provided,'' ATF agent Robert Creighton said Friday.
   Seamus Moley, 30, of Ireland was arrested outside a West Palm
Beach warehouse after handing over $50,000 for the
shoulder-launched, heat-seeking Stinger, which rebels in
Afghanistan used to shoot down Soviet warplanes and helicopters,
Snyder said.
   Kevin Joseph McKinley, 33, and Joseph McColgan, 39, also of
Ireland; and Sean John McCann, 39, were arrested a short time
later, the spokesman said.
   The missile was borrowed from the military for the ``sale,'' and
was supposed to be the first of several transactions with the
Provisional IRA, or ``Provos,'' the guerrilla arm of the
nationalist group fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland,
according to Snyder.
   ``They were talking about other military weapons and military
high explosives,'' he said.
   Customs and ATF agents concocted a similar sting involving
sophisticated weapons in West Palm Beach last June when two men
allegedly sought machine guns and explosives to kill members of a
rival Colombian drug cartel.
   ``I don't think you can take these two instances and draw the
conclusion that this is a center'' for terrorist activities,
Customs supervisor Tim Wagner said Friday. ``It is, however, one of
several places where arms obviously can be purchased.''
   McKinley, Moley, McColgan and McCann were charged with violating
the Arms Export Control Act, possession of a destructive device and
conspiracy. If convicted, each faces up to 25 years in prison and a
$750,000 fine.
   McKinley, Moley and McCann lived at the trailer park for at
least a year, and all four worked in the West Palm Beach area.
   The three roommates shook their heads when asked if they were
guilty as they were led to jail, but McColgan was more talkative.
   ``I'm just a poor Irishman here on holiday, and I was entrapped
by certain people here,'' he said. ``Certain people have offered to
sell me a piece of equipment for the Irish Republican struggle.''

   Pope John Paul II on Saturday hailed
pro-democracy uprisings in Warsaw Pact nations and the greater
liberty in the Soviet Union, but he accused Western democracies of
abusing their freedom.
   In a wide-ranging address to diplomats accredited to the Holy
See, the pontiff also appeared to indirectly criticize the American
invasion of Panama for the harm it caused civilians.
   He praised U.S. and Soviet leaders for improvements in
superpower relations and called for greater religious rights in
Islamic countries.
   The pope's annual address to the diplomats is generally his most
detailed comment on the state of world politics.
   ``The Holy See has greeted with satisfaction the great
transformations that, particularly in Europe, have recently marked
the lives of so many people,'' the Polish-born pontiff said.
   ``Warsaw, Moscow, Budapest, Berlin, Prague, Sofia and Bucharest
... have become like the stages of a long pilgrimage toward
liberty,'' John Paul said.
   ``We must render homage to the people who, at the cost of
immense sacrifices, courageously carried this out, and to the
political authorities who favored it.''
   The pope did not mention any leaders by name, but he appeared to
be extending clear support for the liberal policies of Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, whom he met in December in the first encounter between a
pontiff and a Soviet leader.
   In contrast to the glowing comments about Eastern Europe, the
pontiff said Western democracies often do not know how to use their
liberties and instead embrace such ``counter-values'' as egoism,
hedonism, racism and materialism.
   ``The newcomers to freedom and democracy should not be let down
by those who are considered `veterans,''' John Paul said in French.
   While praising the uprisings in Eastern Europe, the pontiff
warned of ethnic and nationalist passions unleashed by movements
for greater liberty.
   ``The consequences of the Second World War ... call us to
vigilance,'' he said. ``Century-old rivalries can still resurge,
conflicts among ethnic minorities can inflame anew, nationalist
feelings can be exacerbated.''
   Turning to superpower relations, the pontiff said his contacts
with U.S. and Soviet leaders had revealed ``their will to build
international cooperation on a more secure foundation.''
   On the subject of Panama, he appeared to criticize the U.S.
invasion that ousted dictator Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   ``There, once again, it is the civil population that has
suffered the most,'' John Paul said. ``It is to be hoped that,
without delay, the Panamanian people can recover a normal life,
with the dignity and liberty that are the right of a sovereign
people.''
   The pontiff called on Islamic countries to provide greater
religious rights and a bigger role in public life for their
Christian minorities.
   The pope also touched on the following areas:
   _Africa. John Paul praised the holding of elections in Namibia
and the negotiations to end conflicts in Angola and Mozambique. He
said political reforms in South Africa had to be ``better
translated into reality.''
   He also decried the wars in the Sudan and Ethiopia that were
aggravating famines there.
   _Latin America. The pope said the holding of democratic
elections in Chile and Brazil were an ``important step.'' He
condemned the slaying of six Jesuit priests in El Salvador and said
it was a ``suicidal illusion'' to think that violence could solve
the country's problems. He also assailed violence and terrorism in
Peru and Colombia.
   _Middle East. The pontiff said the situation of Lebanon remained
``precarious'' and that the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank
were ``still submitted to suffering that is difficult to accept.''
He said the Israeli-Palestinian problem could only be resolved
through negotiations recognizing the ``legitimate aspirations'' of
both sides.
   _Far East. John Paul called for a peaceful resolution of the
Cambodian and Sri Lankan conflicts. He encouraged Vietnam's recent
opening toward the West and greater tolerance of religious
activity. ``The church and the Holy See are obviously ready for all
dialogue that could improve the situation in that country,'' he
said.

<HEAD>DeVries Would Consider Using Banned Artificial Heart To Save A
Life</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first surgeon to implant the Jarvik
artificial heart says he might use it again if a patient's life
were threatened, even though the Food and Drug Administration has
withdrawn its approval.
   ``I have an option of either disobeying the law and helping a
dying patient, or letting the patient die because I'm scared of
what the FDA will do to me,'' said Dr. William C. DeVries.
   ``If it comes to a matter of you getting slapped on your wrist
and saving a patient's life, you'd rather get slapped on the
wrist.''
   The FDA said last week it was withdrawing approval of the
device's use after inspections revealed ``serious deficiencies'' in
the way Symbion Inc., the Jarvik's manufacturer, was carrying out
studies with the device.
   The FDA cited shortcomings in quality control, research-site
monitoring, training of personnel and reporting of adverse
reactions.
   DeVries said Friday he believes the Jarvik ``is scientifically a
sound device, and it keeps people alive that would normally die.''
He would refuse to use the device if he found problems affecting
the quality of the artificial heart, he added.
   But ``I don't intend to have my patients suffer because I don't
have a device available,'' the Louisville-based surgeon said.
   The head of the transplant and artificial-heart program at the
University of Arizona, Dr. Jack Copeland, also said last week he
would consider continued use of the artificial heart because he
believes there is no scientific basis for the FDA's decision.
   DeVries said he asked the FDA what he should do about Carl E.
Bryant, a suburban Louisville man who received a Jarvik 7-70 on
Dec. 22 as a bridge to a heart transplant. He said the FDA told
him, ``You go ahead with what you're doing.''
   DeVries said the Jarvik has been used by 37 clinical
investigators and implanted as a bridge to a transplant more than
150 times, making it one of the leading devices being used to buy
time for patients who need heart transplants.
   DeVries was the only surgeon in the United States authorized by
the FDA to perform permanent implants of artificial hearts.
   He implanted the Jarvik-7 into the chests of Barney Clark _ the
world's first artificial heart patient _ William Schroeder, Murray
Haydon and Jack Burcham. Schroeder of Jasper, Ind., lived 620 days
after receiving his Jarvik-7 Nov. 25, 1984, becoming the longest
living receipient of the artificial heart.
   The last permanent artificial heart recipient was Burcham, who
died 10 days after the implant on April 14, 1985.
   DeVries' artificial heart research is funded by Humana Inc., a
Louisville-based health-care chain that lured him from the
University of Utah several years ago. DeVries said Humana supports
his intention to explore the possibility of using other mechanical
assist devices as well the Jarvik.
   But the surgeon notes ``it would take months'' to gain the
necessary approval to switch.
   Humana's commitment is to research on artificial hearts and
mechanical assist devices, ``not to the Jarvik specifically,'' said
company spokeswoman Susan McArthur.

<TEXT>
   Police blunted a Ku Klux Klan homecoming
rally Saturday in the town where the group was founded by citing
its leader with violating a parade ordinance.
   About 200 white supremacists from various groups gathered in the
town square to hear the Rev. Thom Robb, national director of the
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, blast communists, homosexuals, the
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and his ``worshipers'' and local
officials who had opposed his group.
   Later Saturday, more than 300 Klansmen and skinheads chanted
hate slogans as they marched around the town square in
Lawrenceburg, about 20 miles west of Pulaski. A man who drew
derision from the white supremacists was arrested for grabbing an
American flag from a pole and trying to burn it.
   The Klan has marched through Pulaski on the Saturday before
King's birthday for the past four years. Officials tried to preempt
the hate group by obtaining the only parade permit the town would
issue for Saturday, a restriction upheld by a federal judge last
week.
   Police cited Robb with violating the local ordinance, and he was
ordered to appear in court when he refused to sign the citation.
   ``We didn't have a parade. We were blocked out of a place to
meet,'' Robb said, accusing ``narrow-minded promoters of
intolerance'' of trying to deny the Klan freedom to peacefully
assemble and freedom of speech.
   However, Klansmen and skinheads taunted a man holding a poster
supporting King's ideals, ripped the poster from his hands and
tried to burn it.
   ``I just wanted to come and show the other side of the story,''
said Sam Black, 22, a journalism student from Western Kentucky
University.
   ``If I can make one little bit of difference I would like to
show someone here something else besides hatred,'' Black said.
   Pulaski, 71 miles south of Nashville, was the birthplace of the
original Ku Klux Klan in 1866. Modern Klan factions evolved from a
second movement organized in 1915.

<HEAD>Soldiers Kill Three in West Belfast</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soldiers in plainclothes shot
and killed three men who were allegedly holding up a betting shop
Saturday in West Belfast, police said.
   A fourth man, apparently a passer-by, was wounded by gunfire,
the Royal Ulster Constabulary said.
   Police later said the alleged robbers had been carrying very
realistic replica guns.
   Police did not immediately identify the dead men, but Sinn Fein,
the legal political wing of the Irish Republican Army, said the
names they had been given by local people were of men ``with a long
track record of this sort of thing.''
   Sinn Fein denied that any of the dead were members of the IRA,
though Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams accused the security forces
of ``the cold-blooded and savage murder of three young men.'' He
made the accusation before it was reported the guns were fakes.
   The predominantly Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule
in Northern Ireland and unite the 60 percent Protestant province
with the 95 percent Catholic Irish Republic.
   Brian Mawhinney, Northern Ireland minister, said Saturday's
killings would be thoroughly investigated.
   ``Does anyone really believe that the would-be robbers told
either their intended victims or the security forces that the guns
they were carrying were in fact only imitations?'' he said.
   In their statement, authorities of the constabulary said two
soldiers who were on duty but not in uniform interrupted a robbery
at a betting shop on the Falls Road in West Belfast.
   ``Shots were fired, and three persons were killed _ one man in a
car and the others, both of whom had been hooded, outside a stolen
vehicle. A fourth person, believed to be a passer-by, was injured.''
   Police said the car used by the suspects had been stolen from a
hospital parking lot the previous night.
   A spokesman for the constabulary, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said he did not know who started the shooting. He also
declined to comment on reports in Belfast that the soldiers were
members of the elite SAS, the Special Air Service unit of the
British Army. He said such reports were ``rumor and speculation.''
   A man interviewed by Independent Television News, who claimed to
have witnessed the shooting, said the soldiers fired at two men as
they lay wounded on the sidewalk. The man was not identified in the
report.

<TEXT>
   A half-million-gallon oil spill that one
official dubbed Exxon's ``mini-Alaska'' has fouled one of the East
Coast's richest spawning grounds, and environmentalists fear it
will cause long-term devastation.
   The Environmental Protection Agency said it was prepared to fine
Exxon Corp. $10,000 a day starting Wednesday unless it received a
detailed explanation of the Jan. 2 spillof home heating oil in the
Arthur Kill shipping channel between New Jersey and the New York
City borough of Staten Island.
   New Jersey filed suit Friday against Exxon over the
567,000-gallon leak from an underwater pipeline _ which the company
originally had pegged at just 5,000 gallons. But New York officials
decided not to sue because the company agreed to pay for an
environmental study and damages.
   Carcasses of oil-coated ducks and dying seagulls have been
recovered from the shores of Prall's Island, one of the Audubon
Society's oldest urban sanctuaries. By midday Saturday, 369 birds
had been counted dead by the Coast Guard and dozens more were being
cleaned and treated for injuries.
   ``The number we find dead are obviously very conservative
numbers,'' said Bruce Freeman, administrator for the marine
fisheries division of the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection.
   ``The ones you find aren't necessarily all the ones that died.
Some of these may fly into another area and die weeks later or
months later,'' he said.
   Exxon's wildlife coordinator, John Launchi, said Saturday that
the waterway is clean and the cleanup crew will focus on sopping up
oil in the marshlands.
   ``The cleanup effort is lessening because we've recovered all
the oil from the Arthur Kill,'' he said. ``But the maintenance work
will go on for a long time.''
   The fish and other organisms that have evolved to survive in the
long-polluted waterways may not be able to take this latest punch,
said Judith Weis, a Rutgers University doctor of zoology who has
studied the waterway for 10 years.
   ``They may not be able to produce as well; their eggs may not
hatch properly,'' she said. ``We are looking at the few survivors
as it is. Think of them as the heroes who have managed to persist
in this dreadful place.
   ``Now they could be pushed over the brink.''
   Ms. Weis, who is on leave from Rutgers and working at the
National Science Foundation in Washington, said: ``I would
certainly not predict that the populations will be totally wiped
out. I can predict that their populations will be sharply reduced.''
   As the food supply becomes more scarce, birds will be forced to
fly to areas such as the Hackensack Meadowlands to survive, said
Peter Dunne, spokesman for the New Jersey Audubon Society. That
will force birds that normally migrate there to make room for the
Arthur Kill birds.
   ``You can think of it as musical chairs and somebody just pulled
one of the chairs out of the room,'' Dunne said. ``Eventually,
someone lands on the floor.''
   New Jersey sued Exxon on Friday to recover damages from the oil
company's spill, and officials left open the possibility of filing
criminal charges.
   Exxon, in response to the threat of a lawsuit by New York, said
it will pay for ``appropriate'' environmental studies of its oil
spill, and that it has accepted responsibility for ``damages for
which it is liable.''
   New York Attorney General Robert Abrams held off on the suit but
said he would not hesitate to file court papers if Exxon goes back
on its word.
   ``Exxon's violations of New York State's Navigation and
Environmental Conservation Laws and the federal Clean Water Act are
obvious and incontestable, and have created a `mini-Alaska' in the
Arthur Kill,'' Abrams wrote to Exxon.
   Last March, an Exxon tanker ran aground on a reef an spilled 11
million gallons into Alaska's pristine Prince William Sound.
   In New Jersey, officials say Exxon has not refused to pay for
costs involved with the cleanup and restoration of the area, but
the company has not agreed either.
   ``The state is incurring substantial costs,'' said John Hagerty,
spokesman for the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection. ``Whatever we spend, we anticipate Exxon paying for,
either voluntarily or pursuant to a court ruling. We haven't been
able to put a pricetag on our environment yet.''
   The EPA gave Exxon until Wednesday to explain how the spill
occurred, what the company's response was to protect the
environment and what is being done to restore the environment. EPA
spokeswoman Kim Helper said her agency was particularly concerned
that Exxon initially estimated only 5,000 gallons of oil had
spilled.
   Exxon officials originally blamed a faulty leak-detection alarm
for allowing so much oil to spill undetected. But on Tuesday they
revised that assessment, saying the device was oversensitive, but
not faulty, and said its attorneys advised them not to say anything
further on the cause.
   Exxon spokesman Phil Wetz said the company also would not
comment on the proposed EPA fines or on the New Jersey lawsuit.

   The first of 7,000 Vietnamese imprisoned
because of their U.S. ties during the Vietnam War will begin
resettlement in the United States this weekend, the White House
said Saturday.
   The former South Vietnamese soldiers, government workers, former
employees of the U.S. government and their families are being
brought here under an agreement concluded last July with the
communist government in Hanoi, said presidential Press Secretary
Marlin Fitzwater.
   Neither the White House nor the State Department gave details on
when and where the 61 Vietnamese would arrive in this country from
Bangkok, Thailand, where they have been since early this month.
   Fitzwater said the refugees' arrival represents ``years of
intensive U.S. diplomatic efforts to obtain permission for those
persons and their families who were closely associated with the
United States during the Vietnam War period to immigrate to the
United States.''
   ``All Americans rejoice at this event, but we particularly share
the joy of those in the Vietnamese-American community who will now,
at long last, be reunited with their family and friends in the
United States,'' said Fitzwater.
   Another 88 former detainees are scheduled to arrive here later
this week, with the total to reach 700 by the end of the month, the
White House said.
   The entire 7,000 are expected to be in the United States by
Sept. 30.

<TEXT>
   A top Justice Department lawyer who played a role
in the Oliver North case was named Saturday to help lead the
prosecution of ousted Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega on drug
charges.
   U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen said Deputy U.S. Solicitor General
William C. Bryson and two Miami assistants would lead the
prosecution team, and removed himself from the case.
   Lehtinen said at a news conference that he never planned to
prosecute Noriega despite appearing as co-counsel at Noriega's
arraignment.
   ``My approach has always been to assemble teams of experienced
assistants to win the many long, complex cases we face here,'' the
prosecutor said. ``The Noriega case has been no different.''
   Noriega, who surrendered Jan. 3 to U.S. troops who invaded
Panama, is accused of using his country to protect shipments of
cocaine, drug-processing chemicals and drug money. He is believed
held in a basement apartment at the federal courthouse. The
February 1988 indictment named 15 other people.
   Bryson will coordinate the drafting of briefs and argument of
legal issues in the case, Lehtinen said.
   Bryson is a former law clerk to Supreme Court Justice Thurgood
Marshall and has been with the Justice Department since 1978. He
was named deputy solicitor general in 1986 after heading the
criminal appellate section.
   He was acting solicitor general last year, and during that time
wrote the government's Supreme Court brief urging the justices to
overturn the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision guaranteeing a woman's
right to an abortion.
   Bryson was also involved last year in the attorney general's
effort to prevent leaks of classified information at former White
House aide North's Iran-Contra trial.
   Classified information is a concern in the Noriega case because
of the fallen Panamanian ruler's long association with the CIA.
   Lehtinen said all information needed to successfully prosecute
the case will be provided to prosecutors.
   ``The United States government has every intention of providing
all material necessary for the prosecution,'' he said. ``Mr. Bush
has said that.''
   Defense attorneys already are asking for classified materials,
Lehtinen has said.
   Also named to head the team were Assistant U.S. Attorneys
Michael Patrick ``Pat'' Sullivan and Myles H. Malman, both longtime
Miami prosecutors.
   Lehtinen said Attorney General Richard Thornburgh did not order
him off the case, although unidentified Justice Department sources
in Washington expressed reservations last week about Lehtinen's
ability to run the busy Miami office and handle a trial expected to
last up to six months.
   Lehtinen said it was his decision to not try the case.
   ``There are a number of other major drug, white-collar crime,
public corruption and other cases pending in the Southern District
of Florida, and in my role as chief federal prosecutor for this
district I could not devote the time to the Noriega case that would
be needed for its proper presentation to the court,'' he said.

   Some of the estimated 35,000 people who
jammed the Capitol grounds for Gov. L. Douglas Wilder's
inauguration couldn't see the ceremony and had to strain to hear
the oath of office. But it didn't matter.
   They got what they came for: a feeling of being a part of
history, seeing the nation's first elected black governor take
office.
   ``I'm a little disappointed we couldn't get any closer,'' said
Lillian Wiggins of Washington, D.C. ``But the fact that I brought
my grandchildren and that it's an historic occasion makes it
important that we stay.''
   She added, ``We'll go home and see what happened on television.''
   The crowd was more than twice as large as the one that saw
Wilder's predecessor, Gerald L. Baliles, take office four years ago.
   As they waited for the ceremony to begin, many in the crowd
commented that the weather was ideal. Temperatures were in the 30s
but seemed warmer to bundled-up spectators who were jammed
shoulder-to-shoulder in bright sunshine.
   Security was tight, with police guarding entrances to the
grounds and ushering spectators to roped-off areas. Latecomers were
stuck with bad vantage points even if they had tickets for
bleachers reserved for 3,500 invitees.
   ``We had tickets, but we showed up late and they wouldn't let us
in,'' said Nolan Dawkins, a judge from Alexandria. The Dawkins
children were glad they came anyway, because they got to see the
parade of marching bands and military units that followed the
swearing-in ceremony.
   ``I wanted to come because I want to tell my kids about this
when I grow up,'' said Kelli Dawkins, 9. ``I want to tell them I
was there to see the first black governor.''
   Kelli's sense of history was lost, however, on 3-year-old sister
Ashley. Asked if she knew who Doug Wilder was, Ashley replied:
``Kelli's friend.''
   Rachel Wheaton didn't make the mistake Ms. Wiggins and the
Dawkins family made. The Petersburg High School history teacher and
72 students staked out places front and center at 8 a.m., four
hours before the ceremony.
   ``Some of these kids got up at 4:30 this morning,'' Ms. Wheaton
said. ``Some of them asked off their weekend jobs so they could
attend, and others gave up their free Saturdays because they know
this is historic not only for Virginia, but for the nation.''
   Savannah Williams, a cultural anthropologist from Surry, was
first in line for one of about 300 available seats for a 9 a.m.
prayer service at St. Paul's Episcopal Church across from the
Capitol.
   ``I've been standing here in the cold since 7:15,'' Ms. Williams
said. ``Africans first came here in 1619, and now it's 1990. I
think it's important to see a person of African descent finally
become a governor.''

<DATELINE>ROSSITER, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For months, American Red Cross officials
were mystified by weekly donations of $1 or less from an anonymous
contributor who has sent in $17 thus far for victims of Hurricane
Hugo.
   Recently they discovered the benefactor is Dalbey Marsh, 51, a
mentally handicapped man who lives in Rossiter and ekes out the
contributions from his Social Security income. Now the Red Cross
wants to give him special thanks.
   ``We are going to send him some stuff and a certificate thanking
him for helping us out,'' said Glenn Ellis, executive director of
the Charleston, S.C., Red Cross.
   ``What I told him is how much we appreciate that dollar we got
from him each week _ even more than the big donations _ because we
knew it really came from his heart. He may have his troubles, but
he really cares about people,'' said Ellis.
   ``I'm glad to humbly do good to help the poor and help end
suffering,'' Marsh said Saturday. ``I just wanted to be generous
and help out. It's just because I want to be nice. I have my
troubles, too, and some of those used to be pretty bad. But I am a
Christian, and I try to be kind.''
   Marsh moved to a personal care home 3{ years ago after spending
20 years at a state hospital in Torrance.
   Red Cross officials had been baffled about the donations since
they began arriving in September. The drawn-out scrawl on the
envelopes led them to believe that the mystery donor was a child.
   Marsh's identity was learned with the help of Dolores Comstock,
Rossiter's postmaster.
   Ms. Comstock said Marsh has made many trips over the past few
years to her Main Street post office to mail money to various
charities. When he was unable to donate a dollar bill, she taped
his change to a piece of cardboard.
   ``I'd notice he would send a dollar, or change, to the Helen
Keller Foundation,'' she said. ``He had seen ads on TV that money
helps buy vitamin A to eradicate blindness in children in Third
World countries. He was concerned about children becoming blind.''
   After Hurricane Hugo ripped costal South Carolina in September,
claiming 29 lives and causing nearly $6 billion in damage, Marsh
asked Ms. Comstock where he could send contributions.
   ``I thought of a couple of agencies, and he chose the Red
Cross,'' she said. ``He's on a limited disability income, but he
sends off little bits and pieces of what he has.''
   Marsh said he also sent money to help earthquake victims in San
Francisco.
   ``I like to think what I send helps, but if I can't do it, I
pray about it,'' Marsh said. ``I hug the Bible and say, `Lord,
someone needs your comfort.' In some ways, the Lord has watched
over me.''
   Because of publicity over the past few days Marsh has been busy
taking telephone calls from reporters, but he said he won't let the
attention go to his head.
   ``I even got my face on TV,'' he said. ``But my reward will be
in heaven. I prefer to wait until heaven, for a great reward awaits
me there.''

   Donald Trump said Saturday he and partners
will raze the landmark Ambassador Hotel, site of Robert Kennedy's
murder and a faded glamor palace, to build a major office, hotel
and residence complex.
   The New York billionaire's plan and endorsements by Mayor Tom
Bradley and two key city councilmen seemed to spell doom for the
once-grand edifice, which closed a year ago.
   Residents concerned about vanishing cultural heritage had urged
preservation of the hotel and school district officials wanted to
buy the 23-acre site on Wilshire Boulevard for a badly needed new
high school.
   The project, which was portrayed as in the earliest stages of
planning, will probably include a hotel, office space, shopping
areas and residential buildings, Trump said.
   The New York City-based real estate magnate revealed his
investment in the project at a news conference in the East Garden
room of the 494-room hotel, which opened in 1921.
   It was in an Ambassador kitchen on June 5, 1968, that Kennedy, a
New York senator and Democratic presidential candidate, was
assassinated by Sirhan Sirhan moments after claiming victory in the
California primary.
   Though it once counted U.S. presidents among its guests, and its
famous Cocoanut Grove nightclub was a watering hole for Hollywood
legends, the lobby area was now the only place fit for people to
gather, Trump said.
   The hotel site was purchased last September for $64 million by
Wilshire Center Partners, who include Irish real estate developer
Robin Power and New York developer and investor Scott Malkin.
   Trump, whose involvement was rumored a month ago, was announced
as the new managing partner of what is now Trump Wilshire
Associates.
   He would not estimate the project's cost but anticipated no
problem in financing it.
   ``I'll be investing a substantial amount of money in the project
over a period of years,'' he said. ``I think we're going to have a
very, very easy time getting the financing.''
   The only specific structure envisioned by Trump is a
50,000-square-foot ``Cocoanut Grove Ballroom'' to fill what he said
was the need for a really big ballroom in Los Angeles. It would be
twice the size of the biggest ballroom here.
   The plan was firmly backed by Mayor Bradley, Councilman Nate
Holden, whose district includes the Ambassador, and Council
President John Ferraro.
   The officials characterized the plan as a way to revitalize the
declining neighborhood a few miles west of downtown and link the
downtown business district with the Century City complex on the
city's west side.
   ``I believe it has great potential. This stretch of Wilshire
Boulevard needs to be reborn,'' said Bradley. He noted he had asked
the developers to help find an alternate site for a school in the
area.
   ``Why did it take you so long to find L.A.?'' Ferraro asked
Trump.
   Trump and Holden said the land was too expensive for a school,
even if the Los Angeles Unified School District sought to acquire
it through eminent domain. ``You would have the world's most
expensive school,'' Trump said.
   Trump said it was ``very unlikely'' that any portion of the
original structure would be preserved, and soundly bashed what
remained of the Ambassador's character.
   ``This is not a good building to be in if there was an
earthquake. It is an old structure and from the safety standpoint
... you wouldn't be allowed to build a building like this today,''
he said.
   ``Second of all it's not, according to most, the aesthetic
building that really we should have at this site. It's so old and
so dilapidated and so run down, and ... it's been leaking. ... It's
really in very bad shape.''
   He said virtually every world class architect was vying for the
job of designing the new project and he expected cultural heritage
buffs would ``love'' the result.

<HEAD>Liberal Official in China Reportedly to be Purged</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese authorities will soon purge a liberal
official who pioneered free-market policies in southern China and
advocated democracy, an independent newspaper reported Saturday.
   The Chinese-language daily Ming Pao reported that Yuan Geng, 71,
director of the Commerce Bureau in Shekou, would be dismissed and
his economic reform policy would be criticized.
   Yuan transformed Shekou, a district of the Shenzhen special
economic zone, from bare land into a coastal industrial town after
the government began its experiments in free-market economics in
four coastal cities in 1979, Ming Pao reported.
   The newspaper quoted the liberal leader as having said publicly,
``The Communist Party needs democracy as it needs air.''
   Ming Pao said Yuan put an end to the fixed wage and introduced
social security and housing reform in Shekou, a town 18 miles
northwest of Hong Kong.
   Ousted party chief Zhao Ziyang, then premier, praised the reform
as the ``Shekou model.'' Ziyang was expelled as party chief in the
wake of student-led pro-democracy protests that the government
crushed by sending troops across Beijing in June. He was replaced
by Jiang Zemin, a hard-liner.
   Shekou News, a liberal weekly published by Yuan's bureau, has
been banned since November, Ming Pao reported.
   It said government officials accused Shekou News of organizing
demonstrations, giving full coverage to marches in Beijing, and
calling for press freedom and democracy to support students in the
capital.
   Ming Pao also said a purge of the media has started in the
free-wheeling southern city of Canton and in Shenzhen.
   It said party members must register anew and many media
organizations have been reshuffled.
   It also said the top man of the party newspaper Canton Daily
will be replaced because ``he has not done his best in the previous
investigation.''
   The news paper said party members in the media have had to
reveal what they did during the pro-democracy movement last spring.

<HEAD>Pacific Storm Brings Rain, Snow to California</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A storm soaked California and brought heavy snow to that state,
Oregon and Nevada on Saturday, triggering a mud slide that trapped
several cars and closed a road.
   Scattered showers extended as far east as the northern and
central Rockies, and skies over much of the West were cloudy.
   To the east, snow showers fell in the Great Lakes region, the
upper Ohio Valley and northern New England. Up to a foot of new
snow blanketed northwest Pennsylvania and up to 6 inches fell in
the mountains in the western sections of the state.
   California began getting heavy rain Friday. Between 5 p.m. and 8
p.m. Friday, Sacramento received 1.56 inches of rain. The rainfall
total for the day of 2.53 inches easily surpassed the old record
for the date of 1.65 inches established in 1906.
   On Saturday, several feet of mud came crashing down across the
San Francisquito Canyon Road about 50 miles north of downtown Los
Angeles, closing it in both directions, said Highway Patrol
spokesman Tom Coleman.
   Several cars became mired in the mud, and drivers had to escape
through windows, said Los Angeles County fire Capt. James Jeffries.
No injuries were reported.
   Up to 4 inches of rain were expected in some of northern
California's coastal mountains and coastal Southern California.
   Winter storm warnings for up to 3 feet of snow by Sunday morning
were issued for California's Siskiyou Mountains and Mount Shasta,
the Sierra Nevada range in California and Nevada, and the Lake
Tahoe area in western Nevada.
   Winds gusting up to 40 mph were expected to cause blowing,
drifting snow at higher elevations in Nevada.
   Snow was also expected at higher elevations in Southern
California and Oregon's southern Cascade Mountains.
   Much of the Northeast had blustery winds Saturday. Brisk
southerlies blew over the High Plains, helping raise temperatures
into the 50s. The temperature reached 52 degrees in Casper, Wyo.,
equaling the record high for the date set in 1953.
   The low for the Lower 48 states Saturday morning was 14 degrees
below zero in International Falls, Minn.

   Maoist guerrillas stopped a bus in the
southern Andean highlands, ordered the passengers out and shot and
killed two French tourists, police said Saturday.
   Four other foreign tourists were killed under similar
circumstances in the same area last year.
   The Shining Path rebels stopped the bus Friday night and ordered
the 72 passengers to get out. They then shot and killed 22-year-old
Stephane Marino, a fisherman, and Christelle Berthelot, a
22-year-old student, police said. Both victims were carrying French
passports.
   The bus was traveling between the cities of Ayacucho and
Andahuaylas, about 250 miles southeast of Lima.
   The two French tourists left Lima four days ago, police said.
The region where the two were traveling has been declared an
emergency zone by the government, giving broad powers to the
military to fight leftist rebels.
   The U.S. Embassy and other embassies have issued warnings urging
tourists not to travel to the emergency zones, which account for
nearly a third of the territory of Peru.
   Two German tourists were killed in the same area in May last
year, and an Australian man and a woman from New Zealand were
killed there in November.
   At least 22 foreigners _ including foreign aid workers and one
journalist _ have been killed by the guerrillas since 1980, when
the Shining Path launched its armed insurgency near Ayacucho.
   Eight foreigners were killed in June 1986 when the rebels bombed
a tourist train to Machu Picchu, the ancient citadel of the Incas
near Cuzco.
   The Mao-inspired Shining Path is fighting to topple Peru's
elected government. It operates throughout the Andean highlands, in
the coca-growing jungles of the northeast and some coastal cities.
   The government says more than 17,500 people have died in the
violence since 1980.

<HEAD>12 Rocky Flats Workers Exposed to Beryllium Have Lung Disease</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twelve people who were exposed to the metal
beryllium while working at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant
have contracted a deadly lung disease, according to an Energy
Department study obtained by a newspaper.
   Eight current Rocky Flats workers and four retired employees
tested positive for berylliosis, The Denver Post reported in its
Sunday editions.
   They were among more than 750 employees at the federal complex
16 miles northwest of Denver who have handled beryllium, a metal
used in the manufacture of plutonium triggers. So far, diagnostic
tests have been given to 391 of those workers.
   No deaths have been reported, but the incurable disease usually
proves fatal to 30 percent of those who contract it, doctors said.
   The disease was discovered during a $2 million medical study of
Rocky Flats financed by the Energy Department and the National
Institutes of Health.
   Researchers say it is the biggest workforce study of berylliosis
to date and is scheduled to be completed in 1993.
   The study is being overseen by Denver doctors from the National
Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine and the
University of Colorado Medical School.
   ``This study will have an impact on every beryllium operation in
the world,'' said Dr. Lee Newman, an assistant CU medical professor
leading the research with Dr. Kathleen Kreiss of National Jewish.
   The Energy Department released records on the study after The
Post requested them under the Freedom of Information Act.
   Beryllium is a strong, lightweight metal that increasingly is
being used in nuclear, aerospace, telecommunications and computer
industries, as well as in ceramics, dental alloys, car parts and
golf clubs.
   Berylliosis is difficult to detect because it usually remains
dormant for 10 years after the metal lodges inside the body. The
Denver researchers are trying to develop tests that will warn the
Energy Department if a worker is susceptible to the disease.
   Contact with finished beryllium products isn't hazardous, Newman
said. But an estimated 800,000 American workers have been exposed
to beryllium dust in 93,000 private and government plants across
the nation, and are considered at risk for the disease.
   The Environmental Protection Agency ranks beryllium 28th among
the most-used substances linked to cancer in industry.
   At Rocky Flats, the Energy Department has spent $2 million in
the past four years on a program to improve safety conditions and
reduce airborne beryllium concentrations in manufacturing areas,
said department spokesman Pat Etchart at Rocky Flats.
   ``We've installed high-velocity, low-volume ventilation systems
and more efficient containment hoods in process areas,'' Etchart
said. ``A safety training program for all workers in those areas
has also been initiated and medical monitoring was strengthened.''
   But during an environmental audit of the plant last summer,
Energy Department investigators cited Rocky Flats for not following
federal and state procedures in monitoring beryllium emissions from
smokestacks.
   Rocky Flats' new operator, EG&amp;G Inc., said it is protecting
workers from airborne beryllium dust by insisting on a factory
standard twice as tough as the guideline set by the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration.
   Newman said protection programs at Rocky Flats were improved
after the first case was discovered there in 1984. He believes
``the safety setup is pretty good'' now for beryllium at Rocky
Flats.
   About 2 percent to 5 percent of all workers exposed to beryllium
eventually develop the disease, researchers say.

   An Arab teen-ager Saturday fatally stabbed a
Palestinian man accused of collaborating with Israeli authorities.
Twelve other Palestinians were reported shot by soldiers during
protests in the Gaza Strip.
   In the occupied West Bank, Israeli troops arrested dozens of
Palestinian activists during a series of raids, the army said.
   Hospital officials said 50-year-old Naim Mohamad Handukah was
brought to Shifa hospital in Gaza City with multiple stab wounds in
the chest.
   Arab reports said Handukah was in his taxi company's office in
the affluent Rimal neighborhood when a 16-year-old youth broke in
and attacked him with a dagger.
   The army confirmed the death.
   ``The police carried out a chase after the youth, but he got
away,'' said Gaza District Police spokesman Yigal Golan. He said
police knew the name of the suspect.
   Israel radio said Handukah was apparently accused of
collaborating with Israeli authorities.
   His killing came hours after masked Arabs shot to death Safedin
Al Qudsi, 40, in the Bureji refugee camp Friday night. Arab
reporters said he was also suspected of assisting Israel.
   The deaths brought to 170 the number of Palestinians killed by
fellow Arabs during the 2-year-old Palestinian uprising against
Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Most have been
accused of collaborating with Israel.
   At least 646 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers
or civilians, and 43 Israelis have been slain.
   In Gaza City, dozens of Palestinians blocked the main commercial
street and hurled rocks at Israeli soldiers manning three nearby
observation posts, Arab reporters and hospital officials said.
   The soldiers opened fire, wounding four Palestinians, hospital
officials said.
   At least four other Palestinians suffered gunshot wounds in a
similar clash in Rafah. Soldiers also shot and wounded four
Palestinians in two other incidents, hospital officials said.
   The army said Palestinians had thrown a bottle of acid on a jeep
patrol but that no one was injured. They said they had no reports
of shooting incidents but were checking further.
   In the West Bank, soldiers raided the villages of Yatta, Beit
Rima, Anabta and Jaba and rounded up dozens of Palestinian
activists, the army said.
   It said troops also confiscated ``much inciteful material and
equipment used by masked youths.'' It did not provide details but
said the villages have been sites of hostile activity.
   Also Saturday, Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, head of the Central
Command, ordered a continued investigation into the actions of
paramilitary border police following a report that they gave a
false account of the fatal shooting of a Palestinian teen-ager,
Israel television reported.
   An investigation determined Thursday that the border police had
violated orders in the death of Fadi Zabakli, a Bethlehem teen-ager
who was killed during a demonstration Dec. 28. He died Sunday.
   Mordechai now wants more information in the case, the television
said.
   The army spokesman had initially said Zabakli and other
Palestinian youths had carried axes and ignored orders to halt as
well as warning shots in the air.
   However, an ABC-TV tape broadcast on Israel television showed
that the youths did not have axes and that a border policeman had
not fired warning shots in the air. Instead, it showed the
policeman kneeling, aiming and firing, hitting Zabakli in the back
of the head.

   Six people, including five children,
died in a house fire early Saturday after they were trapped inside
by window bars intended to guard against break-ins, authorities
said.
   Killed in the Jacksonville fire were babysitter Valerie Johnson,
17, her 2-year-old daughter, Ashley, and four children of Ethel
Landrum, owner of the home. She was in Miami for a hairdressers'
convention, said Wayne Doolittle, a spokesman for the Jacksonville
Public Safety Department.
   Ms. Landrum's children were identified as Jamal Spencer, 1,
Cleveland Spencer, 3, Kenya Elmore, 14, and Eddick Landrum, 11.
   Padlocked burglar bars on the home's windows and doors prevented
those inside from escaping, Doolittle said.
   The fire, which was reported at 12:27 a.m., broke out in a
bedroom. The cause of the fire was still being investigated.
   Ms. Johnson and the 11-year-old were dead at the scene and the
four others died later in hospitals. All the victims died of smoke
inhalation.

   Four men were killed in the
latest round of unrest in the southeastern province of Natal, scene
of a 3-year-old fight between black factions, police said Saturday.
   Two men were killed in separate attacks near the port city of
Durban, and the other two died in Sweetwaters, about 50 miles
inland, police said in their daily unrest report. They gave no
details.
   Members of the United Democratic Front, a nationwide
anti-apartheid coalition, have been battling Inkatha, a relatively
conservative Zulu group, for supremacy in Natal since the end of
1986.
   Both groups oppose apartheid, the white-led government's system
of racial discrimination. However, the Front is more militant and
favors confrontational tactics, such as boycotts and strikes, that
Inkatha does not endorse.
   More than 160 blacks were killed in December fighting in
Durban's townships, and the figure has exceeded 50 so far this
month. At least 13 people were killed Thursday night when homes
were set on fire.
   More than 2,500 people have been killed since the two groups
began fighting.

<TEXT>
   More than a year after Pan Am Flight 103
blew up over Lockerbie, police officials from that Scottish town
came to the United States to brief relatives of the bombing's
victims on Saturday.
   About 130 people showed up at the St. Charles Hotel in this town
about 30 miles south of Albany to hear Chief Constable George Esson
of Lockerbie give details of his department's investigation.
   ``Better late than never,'' said Bert Ammerman, president of
Victims of Pan Am Flight 103.
   The group Ammerman heads is made up of relatives of the 259
people killed when a bomb smuggled aboard Flight 103 exploded over
Lockerbie on Dec. 21, 1988. Eleven more people were killed on the
ground as debris from the exploded jet rained down on the Scottish
village.
   Esson said he and two other investigators traveled to the United
States because Ammerman, a resident of River Vale, N.J., requested
that they inform families individually in a way the U.S. government
had seemed unwilling to do.
   Victims of Pan Am Flight 103 came together after the crash in
part because the families were frustrated by the lack of
information coming from their own government.
   ``We've not only lost loved ones, but the love of our country
and the feeling that our country would be there for us,'' said Bill
Monetti of Chatham, N.J., whose nephew, Rick Monetti, was killed in
the crash.
   ``We have a government that would like this to be an invisible
episode,'' said Georgia Nucci of Hudson, who lost her son Chris
Jones.
   However, many family members who showed up said they were
encouraged that agents from the FBI and a member of the
Presidential Commission on Security, Aviation and Terrorism showed
up at the briefing.
   Ammerman, whose brother Tom was killed in the bombing, said he
would like to see U.S. law enforcement agencies act more like their
counterparts in Scotland.
   ``Today's meeting was a major step forward in having appropriate
agencies extending themselves to the families,'' he said.
   Informational packets were handed out to the families at a
closed-door briefing Saturday morning. The contents of the packets
were not revealed, but Esson said that catalogues were included
listing items recovered at the crash site that are still unclaimed.
   About 15 percent of the personal effects of the victims is still
in storage in Lockerbie, Esson said.
   Nucci said the closed-door meeting also featured videos showing
a reconstruction of the bombed out portion of the plane and the
memorial service held last Dec. 21 in Lockerbie to mark the
one-year anniversary of the crash.
   A presidential commission has been investigating the disaster
since last August. Their report is tentatively due on May 1.

   Swedish-born actress Viveca Lindfors was slashed
across her neck on a Manhattan street early Saturday by a marauding
gang suspected in a similar random attack minutes earlier, police
said.
   The 70-year-old actress, whose stage and screen career covers a
half-century, needed 27 stitches after the attack at about 1:35
a.m. on a Greenwich Village street, said police spokesman Sgt.
Peter Berry.
   Another victim required 40 stitches when he was slashed from his
ear to his throat, Berry said.
   Police had no motive and had made no arrests.
   Despite her injuries, Ms. Lindfors went ahead Saturday afternoon
with a performance for senior citizens, said her granddaughter,
Natasha Fried. The actress later said she would not allow the
attack to drive her from the city.
   ``This is where we live, me and my children and grandchildren,
and we're not going to be kicked out by those bastards,'' she told
the Daily News.
   But Ms. Lindfors also showed some compassion for the person who
slashed her.
   ``I'm coming off easily, compared to him,'' she told The New
York Times. ``My ear is cut, but his life is going to be hell if he
doesn't face something within himself.
   Her granddaughter said Saturday afternoon's audience would not
have known if Ms. Lindfors was in any pain.
   ``She was great,'' the granddaughter said. ``It was a good
outlet for her. It was a good way for her to release emotion.''
   The show, ``An Actor Works: Poetry,'' took place in The Theater
Studio a few blocks from where the attack occurred, said Ms.
Lindfors' daughter, Lena Tabori.
   ``She's unbelievable. She got in at 5:30 this morning, got up at
10'clock and she goes on at three,'' said Ms. Tabori from her
mother's Manhattan apartment. ``This is typical of Viveca. She's
incredible.''
   According to police, Ms. Lindfors and three other actresses were
talking on a sidewalk after completing a Friday evening performance
at The Theater Studio. A group of five or six men ran past the four
women, slashing Ms. Lindfors and continuing on, police said.
   Ms. Lindfors said she and her friends were discussing Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Lithuania when she was attacked. ``In
the middle of this discussion, this kid, he grabbed my face. ...
And the next second I found myself down on the pavement,'' she said.
   Ms. Lindfors was slashed on the neck below her left ear. When
she arrived at St. Vincent's Hospital for treatment, she met the
gang's other victim _ 36-year-old Dennis Beal of New York, who was
attacked shortly before Ms. Lindfors.
   Berry said the two attacks occurred five minutes and three
blocks apart. Police are theorizing the same group of men were

<HEAD>Rare, Slight Quake Rattles Baltimore Suburbs</HEAD>

   Suburban Baltimore residents were shaken by
tremors from a rare, light earthquake on Saturday, said a
spokeswoman for the U.S. Geological Survey.
   An earthquake with a magnitude of 2.5 on the Richter scale
occurred at 4:48 p.m. EST in the Baltimore area, said USGS
spokeswoman Pat Jorgenson.
   The epicenter of the quake was about 15 miles northwest of
downtown Baltimore, she said.
   The Richter scale is a measure of the energy released during
ground motion caused by an earthquake. An earthquake of magnitude 2
is the smallest normally felt by humans and usually causes no
damage.
   ``California probably has several hundred daily in this range,''
said Jorgenson, explaining there were no damages or injuries
reported.
   Jorgenson said scientists at the National Earthquake Center in
Golden, Colo., ``were a bit surprised'' when they began getting
calls from residents in Randallstown and Ellicott City, Md., who
felt the tremors.
   Scientists ``are very sure this was an earthquake'' because they
verified it on seismograms from the East Coast, the spokeswoman
said.
   The last probable reported earthquake in the Baltimore area was
in 1939, according to USGS records.
   ``I'm surprised they (area residents) even knew it was an
earthquake since it wouldn't feel like anything more than a truck
rumbling by'' a private home, said Jorgenson.
   USGS experts said there is no identifiable fault in the area,
Jorgenson said.

   Louisiana Republicans on Saturday endorsed a
New Orleans state senator to challenge incumbent U.S. Sen. J.
Bennett Johnston, decisively rejecting a bid by a former Ku Klux
Klan leader to gain the nomination.
   Delegates at the statewide convention picked state Sen. Ben
Bagert over three other announced candidates _ Secretary of State
Fox McKeithen, state Rep. Quentin Dastugue of Metairie and state
Rep. David Duke of Metairie, the former Klan leader.
   The final vote showed Bagert with 451 of the convention's 792
delegate votes, followed by Dastugue with 183, McKeithen with 99,
Duke with 52 and New Orleans businessman Pat Taylor with three.
There were four abstentions.
   ``We have the energy and experience and the guts to lead a
willing campaign,'' Bagert said in accepting the nomination.
   Bagert, 46, had been considered the front-runner for the party
nomination after winning commitments from than 350 of the 540
delegates chosen at party caucuses statewide on Dec. 9.
   The delegates elected at the caucuses, however, had not been
required to support the candidate they said they would vote for.
   Duke, 39, won no more than 50 delegates at the caucuses and
party officials said previously he had little support among party
regulars. He said he would oppose Johnston regardless of whether he
won the GOP endorsement.
   ``I believe that I can beat Bennett Johnston. I believe that I
can attract people who have not come to our party yet,'' Duke said
after Bagert was nominated.
   Duke, elected to the state House last year as a Republican, has
ties to neo-Nazi groups and currently is president of the National
Association for the Advancement of White People.
   The party's endorsed candidate for next October's general
election could gain access to many resources from both the state
and national Republican Party campaign committees, including lists
of potential donors and volunteers.
   Political analysts have said it would take such a major
commitment to beat Johnston, a three-term Democrat who heads the
Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. He has been in
office since 1972 and won re-election with 86 percent of the vote
in a 1984 race against minor opponents.
   However, state GOP chairman William Nungesser has said Johnston
can be beaten this time in spite of a multimillion-dollar campaign
treasury.
   ``We have all these people wanting to run because Bennett is
vulnerable,'' said Nungesser.
   Any Republican or Democrat can run in the Oct. 6 open primary
against Johnston. Each GOP candidate, except Duke, had said he
would not run unless he is the party's nominee.
   The non-partisan primary serves as the general election unless
no one receives a majority. Then the top two vote-getters enter a
runoff, regardless of party affiliation.

<HEAD>Middlebury College Fraternities To Be Forced To Admit Women Or

<TEXT>
   Fraternities on the Middlebury College
campus must admit women or close, the school's Board of Trustees
voted unanimously on Saturday.
   ``I think it represents an imaginative, creative thoughtful and
workable approach to a series of concerns on this campus that have
been with us for a long time,'' said college President Olin Robison.
   A review of the role of fraternities on campus was prompted by
outrage more than a year ago, when members of the Delta Upsilon
fraternity hung a bloodied female mannequin over the balcony of
their house during a party.
   Robison said while there had been other concerns about sexism on
campus in recent years, the incident with the mutilated mannequin
``certainly galvanized campus opinion ... that something needed to
be done.''
   In a statement, the board said ``any social organization that
discriminates on the basis of gender or whose practices have the
consequences of exclusion on the basis of gender are antithetical
to the mission of the college and not appropriate as a mode for our
society at large.''
   Tom Dubreuil, house director of the Delta Upsilon fraternity,
said in a prepared statement that the trustees decision has given
the local and national chapters ``an extremely challenging task.''
   ``The decision does show that the majority of students want to
keep fraternities on campus,'' Dubreuil said. ``I expected a much
more negative response to the future of fraternities, and I think
the trustees have made the fairest decision they could.''
   Under the board's decision, fraternities must have had their
national rules changed on exclusionary policies or have severed all
connections with their national organization to be allowed on
campus after Dec. 31.
   If a fraternity succeeds in getting its national organization to
change the rules to admit women with equal rights, it may retain
its Greek letters. If not, the fraternity buildings will be offered
to other co-educational student groups and be known as ``houses,''
Robison said.
   Fraternities have until the end of March to decide whether to
comply with the board's decision.
   Middlebury College, a small, liberal arts school located about
35 miles south of Burlington, has featured fraternities since the
turn of the century. Sororities have not been part of campus life
since the 1960s, although Middlebury has been co-educational for a
century, Robison said..
   Robison, who is retiring as president this year, said
endorsement of the trustees' action by directors of the Alumni
Association board of directors gives the decision more weight.
   The association, said president William Kieffer in a statement,
``believes that all Middlebury Alumni will accept this as an
excellent solution to a very difficult issue.''

<DATELINE>PRIMOS, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fire at the Delaware County Daily Times
newspaper caused an estimated $1 million in damages Saturday and
forced editors to print Sunday's edition at a nearby sister paper.
   The fire, which broke out in the press room about 2:45 p.m., may
have been caused by roofers using propane torches to repair the
roof of the suburban Philadelphia newspaper office, said Fire Chief
Tom Micozzie of the Primos Secane Westbrook Park Fire Co. No. 5.
   The fire was brought under control about 4:30 p.m. and is still
under investigation, he said.
   Two editors and a reporter were inside the building when its
fire alarms sounded, but they escaped without injury.
   The newspaper's printing press, pressroom, editorial department
and a paper storage area received extensive water damage. In
addition, the roof of the building will have to be replaced,
Micozzie said.
   ``I'd say we're looking at an excess of $1 million in damages,''
he said.
   Much of the water came from the building's sprinkler system,
which Miccozie credited with saving the structure.
   Kelvyn Anderson was one of three staff members working in the
newsroom when the fire broke out.
   ``The alarm went off and at first we didn't realize it was the
fire alarm that went off,'' he said.
   When they saw smoke coming from the press area, Anderson said
he, news editor Jim Atkins and editorial page editor Joe Monchecurt
left the building.
   After the fire was under control, Anderson said the staff was
able to salvage most of Sunday's edition, which had already been
typeset. The paper was taken to the Main Line Times office in
Ardmore to be printed.
   ``We just picked up the paper and put things in a basket and put
them in cars. Have paper, will travel,'' he said.
   Anderson said management officials expected the newspaper to be
in the stands on schedule, but they are uncertain when they will be
able to return to normal operations at their office.
   ``We're playing it as it comes,'' he said.
   The Daily Times is published daily, except Saturday, by Central
States Publishing Inc. It has a weekday circulation of 65,000 and
55,000 on Sundays.

<HEAD>Jury Finds Woman Who Held Baby at Knifepoint Incompetent for Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman charged with holding her infant son at
knifepoint during a 14-hour standoff with police is incompetent to
stand trial, a jury has ruled.
   The state District Court jury ruled Friday that Tracy Diane
Levis, 24, of Houston cannot be tried on aggravated assault charges
because of mental incompetence.
   Judge Charles Hearn ordered Ms. Levis transferred to Vernon
State Hospital. After a few months, psychiatrists will inform Hearn
whether Ms. Levis has regained competence to point of understanding
legal proceedings against her.
   A report by Harris County psychiatrist Jaime Ganc said Ms. Levis
has been in about a dozen mental hospitals in the past five years
and suffers from delusions and paranoia. The report said she hears
``voices of derogatory content'' and later identifies the
``voices'' as belonging to the devil.
   Ms. Levis had been traveling in a car with her mother, Barbara
Levis, and her 1-year-old son, Brandon Duke, on Nov. 3, 1989, when
she pulled a hunting knife on her mother, who was driving the car.
   When Mrs. Levis fled the car, her daughter reportedly chased her
and then locked herself inside the car with the baby.
   Ms. Levis, her face caked with white makeup, was holding the
knife to her son's throat when police arrived. She continued to do
so for 14 hours, despite kissing and patting the child in her lap
during the lengthy ordeal.
   The confrontation ended when police exploded a percussion
grenade near the car, distracting the woman while officers rushed
the car and broke out a window to free the boy and arrest Ms. Levis.
   The boy remains in the care of relatives.

<DATELINE>GUATEMALA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prominent leftist Salvadoran politician
who fled his nation because of threats on his life was found shot
to death near the Guatemala-El Salvador border after he was
reported kidnapped, officials said Saturday.
   A Guatemalan politician and lawyer who was with the Salvadoran
when he reportedly was abducted also was found dead, officials said.
   No one claimed responsibility for the slayings. Salvadoran and
Guatemalan politicians blamed right-wing paramilitary groups that
operate in both countries, but El Salvador's leftist guerrillas
blamed Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani's rightist Republican
Nationalist Alliance party and its founder, Roberto d'Aubuisson.
   The guerrillas, who last week said they were willing to renew
peace talks with the Cristiani government, said they now are having
second thoughts.
   Guatemalan police confirmed the deaths but would not comment
further.
   The body of Hector Oqueli Colindres, 45, deputy
secretary-general of the National Revolutionary Movement in El
Salvador, was discovered Friday night in Jalpatagua, a city 60
miles east of Guatemala City, officials said.
   Oqueli had been shot in the head, a spokesman for the leftist
National Revolutionary Movement said in El Salvador. The other
victim was identified as Gilda Flores, a Guatemalan who was driving
Oqueli to the airport in Guatemala City when they disappeared early
Friday.
   Party officials said both were kidnapped by armed men.
   ``We are not interested in helping the fascist regime wash its
face to seek U.S. military aid and further its plan of annihilating
all types of opposition,'' said the Salvadoran rebels, the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, in a statement made
public in Mexico City.
   The statement referred to Cristiani's scheduled visit to
Washington this week. El Salvador depends heavily on U.S. economic
and military assistance.
   The FMLN said it doubted justice will be done in Oqueli's
slaying or the killing of six Jesuit priests Nov. 16, and this
``leads us to revise our offer for a dialogue.''
   With his U.S. visit about to start, Cristiani on Saturday
identified four officers and five enlisted men as the prime
suspects in the Jesuit killings.
   The FMLN had proposed a meeting within 30 days to renew
cease-fire talks and the government accepted the offer. It was one
of several unsuccessful meetings that government representatives
and guerrilla leaders have held since 1984.
   Guatemalan President Vinicio Cerezo said in a news release his
administration ``severely condemns the assassination'' of both
Oqueli and Flores ``and pledges to clarify the slayings so that
such a grave act of violence does not go unpunished.''
   Cerezo also extended ``condolences to Latin American leaders of
the Socialist International'' currently meeting in Managua, the
Nicaraguan capital.
   Oqueli's party was part of the Socialist International and he
was its secretary for Latin America. The organization groups
moderate, leftist non-communist parties, including major European
parties like West Germany's Social Democrats.
   Mario Solorzano Martinez, secretary-general of Guatemala's
Social Democratic Party, to which Ms. Flores belonged, said the
slayings were ``a combined action of Guatemalan and Salvadoran
paramilitary forces.''
   He said the victims' bodies were found along the highway from
Guatemala to the Salvadoran border.
   The slayings come at a time of increasing political violence in
El Salvador and Guatemala, where rightist factions have
longstanding ties. The governing rightist party in El Salvador,
known by the Spanish acronym Arena, was founded in Guatemala in the
1970s.
   The Salvadoran politician was reportedly on his way to Managua,
where he was to help monitor preparations for the Nicaraguan
election Feb. 25.
   Oqueli, who arrived Thursday in Guatemala, also was reportedly
planning to attend a meeting of Latin American socialist leaders in
Ecuador.
   The leader of the National Revolutionary Movement, Guillermo
Ungo, was the presidential candidate of a leftist coalition in the
March elections in El Salvador.
   Ungo blamed both the Guatemalan and Salvadoran governments for
the killings.
   ``This crime helps the Salvadoran right wing to impede the
development of democracy in El Salvador,'' Ungo said in an
interview with The Associated Press in Managua.
   In London, visiting leftist leader Ruben Zamora of El Salvador
said Saturday he believed right-wing death squads were responsible
for killing Oqueli.
   He did not specifically accuse any group of the killing, but he
claimed that Roberto d'Aubuisson, the founder of Arena, was working
with Guatemalans to kill government opponents.
   Zamora added that in early November ``there was information Mr.
d'Aubuisson was in Guatemala working with his right-wing associates
from there, and the minister of defense of Guatemala has
information that Mr. d'Aubuisson was proposing to take the
opportunity and to kill all the political opponents of the
government.''
   D'Aubuisson has been linked to death squads that killed tens of
thousands of people over the past decade.
   Oqueli was a deputy foreign minister in El Salvador from October
1979 until March 1980, when a military coup overthrew the
government. Like many other leftists, he fled El Salvador after the
coup, but he returned in 1987 to participate in politics.
   He left again in November, as did many Salvadoran leftists,
under protection of the Venezuelan Embassy, after he was threatened
during a major offensive by the Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front guerrillas.
   He had reportedly planned to return Jan. 20. He is survived by a
wife and two children.

<DATELINE>STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jerome Weinstein, the former longtime
editor of the Centre Daily Times whose journalism career spanned
more than 50 years, has died after suffering a heart attack. He was
73.
   Weinstein, who died Friday, was editor of the newspaper from
1945 until his retirement in 1980. He had suffered a heart attack
at his home in State College on Jan. 2.
   Weinstein became sports editor of the Times in 1937, a year
before he graduated from Penn State. In 1940, he was named city
editor-managing editor. The following year, he joined The
Associated Press and served as news editor in Philadelphia and
Harrisburg.
   He rejoined the Times in 1945, after editing a newspaper
distributed from Miami Beach, Fla., throughout the Caribbean.
   During his tenure, the Centre Daily Times grew from a six-page
newspaper with a circulation of 1,800 to a 40-page newspaper with a
circulation of more than 20,000. The staff increased in size from
three to 30.
   Weinstein directed the editorial efforts of the newspaper for 24
years, longer than any other editor of the Times or its weekly
predecessor, The State College Times.
   ``Jerry was the personification of the Centre Daily Times for
more years than most of its readers have been alive,'' said the
newspaper's editor since Weinstein's retirement, Robert Ashley.
``He was instrumental in shaping the nucleus of this end of the
paper, and he maintained his passion for it up until the end.''
   Weinstein was president of the Pennsylvania Society of Newspaper
Editors in 1953 and of the Associated Press Managing Editors in
1958. He was a retired member of Sigma Delta Chi, the journalism
honorary society, the American Society of Newspaper Editors and the
National Conference of Editorial Writers.
   Under his direction, the newspaper staff garnered more than 100
professional awards, including five Sweepstakes Awards, the highest
honor of the Pennsylvania Newspaper Publishers Association and the
Pennsylvania Society of Newspaper Editors.
   Weinstein is survived by his wife, Thomazine Curtin Weinstein,
and two daughters.

<HEAD>Thousands Pray at Iowa Statehouse in Abortion Demonstrations
Around U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of anti-abortion demonstrators prayed Saturday at
Iowa's Statehouse in one of several protests around the country.
Police arrested at least 77 people, including 10 in Utica, N.Y.,
who shackled themselves to an anvil.
   In Boston, an estimated 300 anti-abortion protesters trying to
blockade a downtown clinic were confronted by about 200 abortion
rights advocates, according to police Lt. Herbert Nolan.
   About 100 anti-abortion demonstrators also turned out at a
clinic in the Boston suburb of Brookline; 40 to 50 people protested
in Utica, officials said.
   A crowd of demonstrators from around Iowa police estimated at
6,000 to 7,000 gathered on the Iowa Statehouse steps in Des Moines
for the morning demonstration that was as much a religious revival
as it was a political protest.
   About 100 counterdemonstrators gathered across the street. A few
wandered near the fringes of the crowd carrying signs and coat
hangers, but state troopers kept both groups apart.
   Roman Catholic and protestant clergy and other speakers led
demonstrators in prayers and hymns, and urged them to let their
voices be heard on what one speaker called ``the No. 1 issue facing
America today.''
   ``We've got to come out of our stained-glass cathedrals. We've
got to come out of our homes. We need to speak out at our work
places and say, `Enough is enough,''' said the Rev. Keith Tucci of
Pittsburgh.
   Demonstrators waved flags and held signs, including one
depicting a baby seal carrying a sign reading, ``Save the baby
humans.''
   There were no arrests there, but at a family-planning clinic
about 2{ miles away 39 protesters, including four juveniles, were
arrested on charges of disorderly conduct and resisting arrest,
according to police Sgt. Thomas Van Baale.
   Later, about 3,000 anti-abortion activists marched for an hour
outside the clinic, Planned Parenthood of Mid-Iowa.
   In Boston, anti-abortion activists blocked the clinic entrance,
making it difficult for workers to enter without help from police.
Police arrested at least 10 people on charges of assault and
battery and disorderly conduct, Nolan said. All were believed to be
from the anti-abortion side.
   Nearly 70 police officers erected barricades at the entrance.
Demonstrators on both sides pushed, shoved and shouted, especially
when women tried to enter the clinic.
   Patients who arrived at the clinic had to climb over a police
barrier, with officers helping carry them, she said. A few patients
called to reschedule their appointments.
   In the Brookline protest, police arrested four people, said
police Officer Ronald Pateron. Two anti-abortion demonstrators were
charged with trespassing and two counterprotesters were charged
with assault and battery, said a dispatcher who did not give his
name.
   In Utica in north-central New York state, police arrested 24
people who blocked the entrances to an abortion clinic, including
the 10 who shackled themselves together with bars chained to a
100-pound anvil.
   The protesters said they were members of Operation Rescue.
   Twenty-three of those arrested were charged with trespassing and
disorderly conduct, and one was charged with those violations and
resisting arrest, said police Patrolman Charles E. Janucik II.

   Federal authorities used a Stinger to lure four
suspected Irish Republican Army guerrillas into a sting operation
in which they offered $50,000 for the missile that can shoot an
airliner out of the sky.
   The four men were arrested Friday after going to a warehouse in
the West Palm Beach area to buy the heat-seeking missile from
agents posing as arms dealers who told the suspects the weaponry
was stolen from the U.S. military, said William Gavin, who heads
the FBI in south Florida.
   ``They made it very clear they were interested in procuring
Stinger missiles and high explosives _ and they intended to ship
them out of the country,'' Gavin said at a news conference.
   Kevin Joseph McKinley, 33, Seamus Moley, 30, and Joseph
McColgan, 39, all Irish nationals, and Sean John McCann, 34, of
Canada, are believed to be members of the Provisional IRA, or
``Provos,'' the guerrilla arm of the nationalist group fighting to
end British rule in Northern Ireland.

   The Energy Department, under pressure from
environmental critics, will give the public a chance to review how
its plans to clean up and rebuild the nation's nuclear weapons
complex will affect the environment.
   The announcement Friday by Energy Secretary James D. Watkins
came nearly seven months after 22 environmental and arms control
groups sued the department to force such a review.
   ``The significance of it is that it would be the first
comprehensive and public analysis of the whole weapons program,''
said Dan Reicher, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, one of the environmental groups that sued.
   Reicher said allowing the public to participate in the planning
could lead to significant changes in the future emphasis of the
multi-billion dollar weapons program.

   The Internal Revenue Service is toughening
rules of conduct for senior employees following highly publicized
allegations of misconduct by some field managers.
   The aim, said IRS Commissioner Fred Goldberg, is to protect
``what is the bedrock of our tax system, and that is the real and
perceived integrity of this institution.''
   ``What we need is ongoing attention and adherence to the kinds
of issues of conduct, ethics and appearance that are essential to
tax administration,'' Goldberg said Friday in announcing the ethics
initiative.
   Goldberg acted after congressional hearings last summer in which
managers and other top officials of some field offices were accused
of abusing power, favoring friends and operating almost
independently of directives from the agency's Washington
headquarters.

   President Bush, described as ``pretty broken
up'' by a meeting with the family of a soldier slain in Panama, is
using the invasion to argue that the United States must keep a high
state of military readiness.
   ``This is not a time when we should naively cut the muscle out
of our defense posture,'' Bush said Friday in a speech aimed at
Congress, which reconvenes Jan. 23 after its winter recess.
   Bush cautioned that despite a relaxation of military tensions in
Eastern Europe, lawmakers should not expect a ``peace dividend'' in
which defense savings could be funnelled into domestic programs.
   ``Unfortunately, what is being packaged as a `dividend' is not
money in the bank. It is more like a possible future inheritance,''
Bush said in his speech to the Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce.

<HEAD>Thinking Long Term</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American investors soon might be asked to change
their personalities _ to think long term rather than short term, to
invest rather than trade, to be patient rather than excited and
expectant.
   It's a large order, similar in ways to asking a junkie to get
off the stuff. It can be done, but it will take lots of time and
enormous willpower, with great temptations and failures along the
way.
   Since the 1960s, at least, Americans have been weaned on the
dreams of quick returns _ by brokers, analysts, advisers, tipsters,
letter-writers, the media and tax laws _ with enough success
stories to make it seem the way to go.
   You might even add that the proliferation of state lotteries has
added to the short-term, speculative, easy money, gambling
mentality.
   Old-time brokers and advisers who taught the other ways were
left in the shadows. Their techniques required effort _ choose
quality, understand the company, reinvest dividends, be prepared to
wait five years for a good return.
   They warned that in-out trading was foolish, because the
temptation to sell was great when the stock was at the bottom and
to buy when the stock was near the top. You can't win that way,
they said. Besides, commissions will kill you.
   But they were up against something bigger than they could
handle. Whenever people talked about the market somebody would tell
the story of a friend who made a fortune on a tip, of shoeshine
boys who hit it big, of easy money.
   Besides, the big investors were in-out traders, and look how
they lived. It didn't matter that they were featured in magazines
only when they hit it big, disappearing from view when they lost
it. People love winners, not losers.
   Every day the newspaper brought more excitement, featuring the
winners and how they did it, with interpretations and broker
forecasts of bigger things to come. Brokers like lots of action,
because action makes commissions.
   The short-term mentality is now pervasive, not just in
securities markets but in attitudes about how to run institutions
of every sort, including the family, corporations and the federal
government.
   For millions of families, instant gratification was made
possible by easy credit, and until recent years the cost of that
credit was tax-deductible. Uncle Sam succumbed too; he maintained
his lifestyle with foreign debt.
   Corporate executives might have wished to think long-term and
build their companies for the future, but to do so might have cut
into short-term profits. And so they asked: What will Wall Street
think?
   They still might want to invest funds in research and
development to make a stronger company in the future. But if
shareholders expect dividends now, how do you convince them that it
is better to wait a few years?
   Some executives are in a different situation: they want to spend
today for a stronger tomorrow but they don't have the wherewithal.
Their predecessor borrowed to make acquisitions, and interest
payments now take every nickel available.
   Bush administration officials, especially Treasury Secretary
Nicholas F. Brady, have indicated they would like to focus on the
longer term, but it will take a massive effort. And that effort in
itself will be long term.
   Among other things, they've suggested a ``family savings
account'' where interest would accumulate tax-free. A tax-reduction
for long-term capital gains would of that nature too, but any such
proposal still faces opposition.
   Perhaps the most convincing technique of all is to find ways of
emphasizing the great returns that come from patient, long-term
investing _ in effect, of teaching that time is as important in
investing as interest rates.
   In time, and assuming investors do their homework, it is
difficult not to make money in an economy that keeps growing. It's
all in the numbers, as they say.
   In every decade but two in this century the stock market has
made solid gains far in excess of the inflation rate. That is, the
gains were ``real'' in terms of spendable income, except for the
1930s and '70s.
   In the past 90 years, according to Wright Investors Service,
stocks have provided a compound average annual return of 9.8
percent, or triple the annual inflation rate of 3.2 percent.
   At that rate, investments double every seven years. And if
they're left to double again and again... Well, that's how fortunes
are made.

   Bombings in the South and random acts of violence and vandalism
across the country have given rise to fears that a new wave of
racially and ethnically motivated crime is sweeping the United
States.
   Nearly every day brings a fresh report from somewhere: from
Portland, Ore., where skinheads were charged with beating a
15-year-old Hispanic girl; from Wellesley, Mass., where two young
men were arrested for spray-painting swastikas and racist slogans
on walls; from New York City, where a gang of white youths was
charged with killing a black man who crossed into their turf.
   New organizations have sprung up to fight racism, and police,
judges and legislators are taking a harder look at what they can do
to prevent such crime.
   But among those who closely monitor what are commonly called
``hate crimes,'' there is disagreement about whether racism is
really resurgent. Some argue that only the reporting of racial
crime has increased, not the crime itself.
   ``The paradox is that the better you are at reporting, the worse
your picture is going to look,'' said Col. Leonard Supenski, who
heads the police crime prevention bureau in Baltimore County, Md.
   Supenski speaks from experience. His police department, whose
beat ranges over 610 square miles from the industrial edge of
Baltimore to horse country near the Pennsylvania border, was one of
the first in the nation to begin reporting hate crimes in a
category of their own.
   Baltimore County has kept statistics on RREs _ Racial, Religious
and Ethnic incidents _ since 1979, and its figures show a slight
increase last year after four years of decline.
   The increase could be the result of a more sensitive police
force, quicker to recognize a racist motive behind a crime. It
could be the result of a more trusting public, more likely to
report a crime. Or it could just be part of what Supenski calls the
``ebb and flow'' of crime.
   Only a handful of cities around the nation have kept track of
hate crimes for very long; one is New York City, where ``bias
crimes'' were down slightly during the first 10 months of 1989.
They had been down sharply until Aug. 23, when a gang of whites
surrounded a 16-year-old black youth, Yusuf Hawkins, and shot him
to death on a Brooklyn street. Ripples of lesser racial incidents _
tauntings, beatings _ spread across the city.
   Inspector Paul M. Sanderson, who heads the New York Police
Department's Bias Crime Unit, isn't persuaded that racist crime is
really changing.
   ``There is no pattern,'' he said.
   Sanderson, 54, is black and recalls hate crime in his youth,
although it wasn't called that.
   ``I grew up here and I know what went on in this city,'' he
said. ``And I know that if you went up to a cop and said, ... `I
was hit in the head with a baseball bat, and I got the injury
because I'm black and I was in a white neighborhood,' (he'd say),
`Get out of here, kid, go on home.'''
   Still, for every Paul Sanderson or Leonard Supenski, there are
others who say racist crime is getting worse. They see neo-Nazi
skinheads pumping new life into the Ku Klux Klan, they hear about
racism sprouting on college campuses, and they can tick off lists
of violent incidents around the country that have nothing in common
but their motive _ prejudice.
   One such person is Bill Tafoya, who teaches long-range planning
at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Va., and moonlights at the
Congressional Clearinghouse on the Future _ a sort of institutional
crystal ball. His specialty is civil disorder.
   Tafoya has a simple test for gauging the ups and downs of
racism. Every year, he searches a computer database for references
to four words or phrases _ ``racism or racist,'' ``bigotry,''
``white supremacy'' and ``hate groups.''
   In 1980, those words appeared 767 times in The New York Times
and The Washington Post. In 1988, the last full year for which
Tafoya has records, they appeared 2,122 times _ about a threefold
increase.
   Tafoya concedes that those figures alone don't mean there has
been an increase in racism _ it could just be increased interest in
the subject. But he believes the increase is real and says other
researchers agree.
   Besides, police have become interested in hate crime _ Tafoya
knows because he's constantly asked to lecture to them.
   ``My warning to them is that if they turn away from the issue
... then they're going to be in a very uncomfortable position of
being in the middle when the lid blows off,'' he said.
   The message is not being ignored. More police departments around
the nation are beginning to follow the lead of Baltimore County,
New York City and Boston _ pioneers in establishing special
programs to fight hate crime.
   Minneapolis started a bias crime program in 1987; Philadelphia,
San Francisco and Portland, Ore., are among other cities that now
pay special attention to hate crime.
   Most such programs have two basic goals: to keep separate
reports on hate crimes so that investigators can spot patterns, and
to assure the public that such crimes will not be tolerated.
   ``If the people don't have a sense that they can go the police,
and go to the courts, they're going to go to the streets,''
explained Sgt. Bill Johnston, who directs the Boston Police
Department's Community Disorders Unit.
   Reporting is considered especially important. There are no
national statistics on hate crime now, which is one reason that
people disagree about it. A bill pending in Congress would require
the Justice Department to collect such data.
   Those who follow the issue closely, such as Adele Dutton Terrell
of the National Institute Against Prejudice and Violence, say
passage of the Hate Crime Statistics Act is essential.
   ``People pay attention to hate group activity _ skinheads, the
KKK,'' Ms. Terrell said. ``But when you read about crosses being
burned into the lawn of a family that just moved in, or Asians or
Hispanics being harrassed, people assume these are isolated cases.
We need the data to show that's not the case.''
   In the meantime, at least 10 states have passed laws in the past
few years requiring their police departments to collect data on
hate crimes. And lawmakers are finding other ways to battle racist
crime.
   According to the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, at
least 31 states have passed laws making ``ethnic intimidation'' or
harrassment a crime; at least 34 states have made ``institutional
vandalism'' a crime.
   Courts are also looking for innovative ways to combat racism. In
Eugene, Ore., last year, a man convicted of racial intimidation was
ordered to attend a racial awareness course in addition to serving
60 days in jail.
   And last July in Montgomery, Ala., seven Ku Klux Klan members
agreed to attend a similar course as part of an out-of-court
settlement of a civil lawsuit filed by the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference.
   No one believes these measures are going to end racial hatred or
stop racial violence. That will require more basic social change.
Some hold the economic system responsible; others say the failure
has been in the schools; still others say any change must take
place in homes, in churches, or in people's hearts.
   ``We're doing badly in shaping people and preparing them to go
out and get along in life, and to exist and interact with other
people in a civilized fashion,'' said Sanderson of the NYPD.
``We're all responsible.''

   One thing about your federal income tax return
never changes: You can bet it will never be the same from one year
to the next.
   This year is no exception. There are changes affecting children
as young as 2 and others that will alter the returns of millions of
retirees. There are new forms as well as changes in some familiar
ones.
   All taxpayers will find the bottom line _ their actual tax
liability _ is slightly below what it would have been without some
of the changes enacted in 1986, including inflation adjustments,
that are still taking effect.
   Here is a look at some of the changes:
   EXEMPTIONS: This is $2,000 for 1989 returns, up $50 from 1988. A
taxpayer is allowed one for himself or herself, another for a
spouse and one for each dependent who was alive for at least one
day last year and meets certain tests. A parent may no longer claim
a full-time student 24 or older whose income is $2,000 or more.
   STANDARD DEDUCTIONS: A single person who does not itemize
deductions may claim a standard deduction of $3,100, up $100 from
last year because of inflation. For a couple filing a joint return,
the deduction is $5,200; for a married person filing separately,
$2,600; a qualified head of household, $4,550. A single taxpayer or
head of household is allowed another $750 if at least 65 years old
or blind, or $1,500 if both; a couple gets another $600 for each
spouse who is blind or at least 65, or $2,400 if both are blind and
at least 65.
   TAX BRACKETS: To offset inflation-caused ``bracket creep,'' the
brackets have been widened by about 4 percent so that more income
is taxed at lower rates.
   SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER: You must list on your return the Social
Security number of any dependent child who was 2 or older in 1989.
This requirement, which previously applied only to children 5 or
over, is aimed at preventing both separated parents from claiming
an exemption for the same child.
   CATASTROPHIC COVERAGE: This medical program and the special
surtax that helped finance it have been repealed. Ignore the lines
on your return that refer to the surtax.
   MILEAGE: The deductible mileage allowance for unreimbursed use
of a personal car for business is up to 25{ cents a mile for the
first 15,000 miles driven in 1989 and 11 cents for subsequent
travel. Rates for mileage driven for charitable and medical
purposes remain at 12 and 9 cents, respectively.
   TELEPHONE: You may no longer deduct as a job-related expense any
part of the basic monthly charge for your home telephone; a second
phone line may still be deductible.
   INTEREST DEDUCTION: Only 20 percent of consumer interest _
credit cards, automobile loans, education loans and the like _ paid
in 1989 may be deducted. There is a separate limit on interest paid
to buy taxable investments; you may deduct investment interest
totaling up to the amount of net investment income plus $1,000 for
a married person filing a separate return and $2,000 for all other
filers.
   EARNED-INCOME CREDIT: This benefit for low-income working
families with children has been raised to a maximum tax saving of
$910, with some credit allowed until income reaches $19,340.
   CHILD-CARE CREDIT: Two new restrictions on this credit, which
helps pay expenses of caring for children so parents may hold a
job: The credit now is available only if the child is under age 13;
any employer-paid reimbursement for child care must be subtracted
from the expenses on which the credit is calculated.
   CHILD TAXPAYERS: A parent may file on his or her return the
income of a child _ and thus free the child from filing _ under
these conditions: The child had not yet turned 14 on Jan. 1, 1990,
had income of more than $500 and less than $5,000 and all of it was
from interest and dividends, had no tax withheld and made no
estimated tax payments in 1989.

<HEAD>Crop Report May Mean Higher Wheat Prices</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: An ADD with weekly price trends will follow later in cycle</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   It is a fundamental of economics that when supplies of
commodities tighten, prices rise.
   The market for winter wheat may prove another classic case with
lower than expected plantings threatening to push up prices.
   The verdict is already in for Florida's orange producers: The
December freeze was more devastating than 1983 and production could
be slashed to the levels of the mid-1960s.
   Farmers planted about 57 million acres of winter wheat for
harvest this year, up 3 percent from the previous crop, according
to a U.S. Department of Agriculture report released Thursday.
   Winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested the following
year. It accounts for about three-fourths of the total U.S. wheat
output.
   Two years of drought shrunk the nation's wheat stockpile to 1.42
billion bushels on Dec. 1, down 17 percent from Dec. 1, 1988,
according to the USDA. That makes U.S. supplies at their tightest
since the early 1970s.
   A lingering drought in the Southern Plains states apparently
caused farmers to plant less acreage than they had the previous
fall, an unexpected development.
   Dale Gustafson, an analyst with Drexel, Burnham Lambert Inc. in
Chicago, said the lingering dryness in pockets of the plains may
have already adversely affected the size of the winter wheat crop.
   Gustafson said the tight supplies and smaller than expected
planting could result in a bullish market for wheat.
   ``That is something we are not going to know until we find out
the status of the new crop,'' he said. ``We don't know the extent
of the weather kill and we don't know what the moisture will be.''
   Gustafson said the wheat inventory could remain tight and the
market could turn bullish if the weather is uncooperative.
   The USDA estimated the 1989 corn crop at 7.5 billion bushels,
which was below expectations and soybean production at 1.9 billion
bushels, also lower than expected.
   The weather's impact on Florida's orange crop is already known.
   The USDA has slashed the 1989-90 orange harvest by 29 percent.
Once projected before the December cold wave at only 130 million
90-pound boxes is now 92 million boxes, the smallest estimated
production since the 1964-65 season.
   The orange crop last season was 146 million boxes.
   USDA officials say the full extent of the financial damage
cannot be calculated for months, until a full assessment is made of
damage to trees.
   Florida's citrus crop was worth $1.4 billion last season.

   Gold futures surged in response to declines on the Tokyo and New

   The strength in the oil market may also have been a factor in
gold's surge. Rising oil prices are seen by investors as an
inflation barometer. Gold is considered a hedge against inflation.

<HEAD>Double Whammy: More U.S. Layoffs, GM Expansion Overseas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp., already thick-skinned
about bad publicity from the critical movie ``Roger &amp; Me,''
evidently had no qualms proclaiming more cutbacks in its sickly
U.S. operations while disclosing plans to expand into iberalized
Eastern Europe.
   GM's moves this past week were among the most visible alarm
signals in the U.S. auto industry, where factories are building too
many cars for too few customers. Even Japanese transplants, a major
competitive threat to the American automakers, have said they would
scale back production.
   ``Everyone is very worried about how they respond to the fact we
can build 4 million cars more than consumers seem to be interested
in buying,'' said Thomas Kochan, a Massachusetts Institute of
Technology professor who specializes in the auto industry. ``So the
companies are all struggling to deal with that problem. It suggests
there's going to be more employment reduction over time.''
   GM, along with Big Three rivals Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler
Corp. announced short-term plant closings that will idle nearly
60,000 workers. Previously announced closings temporarily idled
more than 127,000 workers.
   But GM went a step further with a broad new cost-cutting plan
that will offer thousands of white-collar workers early retirement,
limit new hiring and cut advertising.
   Seprately, the auto giant confirmed that it was negotiating over
a possible joint venture to build cars and engines in Hungary,
among the most progressive of the East bloc countries working to
radically transform their economies.
   If completed it would be the first such deal by a Big Three
automaker behind what once was known as the Iron Curtain.
   That investment reflected how prosperous GM has been in Europe,
where strong demand and rising sales have counterbalanced the
company's weak sales and declining market share in the United
States.
   But the timing of GM's announcements _ cutting back at home and
expanding abroad _ seemed to reflect what some critics of the
company have called its insensitivity to American workers,
especially those who have been laid off.
   GM's treatment of its workforce was the subject of ``Roger &amp;
Me.'' The critically acclaimed documentary is about the impact of
GM layoffs in Flint, Mich., years ago, as seen through the eyes of
filmmaker Michael Moore, who tries to track down GM Chairman Roger
Smith to talk about it. The film, playing in theaters nationwide,
is considered a public relations nightmare.
   ``The fact is, GM has a history of doing things like that,''
Kochan said. ``They've announced bonuses for executives while
demanding wage concessions from assembly workers.''
   Arvid F. Jouppi, an automotive industry analyst at the Detroit
investment firm Keane Securities, agreed that GM had a reputation
for ill-timed layoff announcements. But he said the Hungarian deal
reflected how the company was seeking to expand in areas of the
world where the potential for growth is the strongest. In the long
run, Jouppi said, that would benefit GM.
   ``I think in a nutshell we're seeing the globalization of the
entire auto industry,'' he said. ``In the Hungary-U.S. situation,
there would not be a conflict creating jobs in Hungary and taking
them away in the United States.''
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _Stalled sales isn't the only problem confronting the
automakers, who also are heavily involved in defense work at a time
when the Pentagon plans radical cutbacks. Ford Motor Co. announced
plans to sell its aerospace subsidiary, the second of the Big Three
to plan divestment of a major non-automotive business. Chrysler
Corp. put its Chrysler Technologies unit up for sale last month.
   _Renewed inflation anxiety and nervous markets overseas punched
down the U.S. stock market. The Dow Jones average of 30
industrials, Wall Street's best-known barometer, tumbled 71.46
points Friday, the biggest one-day drop since its 190.58 spill last
Oct. 13.
   _Major banks dropped their prime lending rate a half percentage
point to 10 percent, the first decline in a half-year and a signal
of cheaper loan rates for consumers and small businesses. But the
optimism over lower rates was tempered by a government report that
showed December wholesale inflation rose 0.7 percent and brought
the total 1989 inflation rate to 4.8 percent, more than double the
1988 rate. That suggested the Federal Reserve won't ease interest
rates further, as many economists had expected.
   _The board of Campeau Corp., debt-swamped owner of some of the
nation's best-known department stores, moved to separate its
troubled retailing operations from the parent company. The parent
of Bloomingdale's and other chains averted one default deadline by
paying apparel bills and took other steps to appease creditors, but
by the weekend it was still unclear whether Campeau would put the
stores under bankruptcy court protection from creditors.
   _Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd., an Australian conglomerate
overwhelmed by debt, rejected a questionable takeover proposal from
an obscure Texas businessman whose return address was a mail-drop
box. Meanwhile, Canadian brewer John Labatt Ltd. said it was
considering a possible bid of up to $1.6 billion for Bond's
Australian brewing businesses.

<TEXT>
   Wall Streeters who learned to ``think
international'' in the 1980s have grown increasingly edgy about the
economic outlook taking shape at the start of a new decade.
   Before long, they fear, problems like inflation in Great Britain
or rising interest rates in Japan could start to cause real trouble
for the business and financial climate in this country.
   Analysts say those misgivings have played a big part in the U.S.
stock market's shaky start on the 1990s.
   Many yearend forecasts called for lower interest rates for U.S.
consumers and business managers at least through the first several
months of 1990. That optimism seemed to be validated early this
past week as banks announced a long-awaited cut in the prime
lending rate from 10.5 percent to 10 percent.
   Interest rates in the U.S. bond and short-term money markets
held steady even on Friday, when the government reported a larger
than expected 0.7 percent increase in the producer price index of
finished goods for December.
   But stock traders didn't take the news so calmly, confronted as
they were with word of falling markets in Tokyo and London.
   While the Federal Reserve has been gradually relaxing its credit
policy, encouraging rates to fall in this country, central banks in
several foreign lands have tightened credit in an effort to
restrain inflation.
   As a result, German and Japanese interest rates in particular
have been climbing, narrowing a once-wide gap between yields
available in securities of those countries and what global
investors could get in the U.S. Treasury market.
   These days, yields of a little more than 8 percent on American
government bonds must compete with 7.5 percent or so in West
Germany; 6.5 percent in Japan, and around 10.5 percet in Britain.
   Sooner or later, analysts say, this trend could force the
Treasury to pay higher interest rates to attract buyers of its
securities in the world marketplace. In other words, American
interest rates would rise because of a form of international
competition.
   ``I believe that any further moves by the other central banks to
raise rates would be a very important factor in determining the
investment outlook for 1990,'' said strategist Greg Smith in his
current market commentary for Prudential-Bache Securities.
   Taken to its extreme, international interest-rate competition
could foster a global credit-tightening that might increase the
chances of recession in most or all industrial countries.
   Such visions, analysts say, are a long way yet from becoming
reality. But the prospect alone was enough to stifle the stock
market's early-1990 rally before it got very far.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 84.04 to 2,689.21
in the past week, wiping out the previous week's 20.05-point gain.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped 6.32 to
188.32; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
lost 18.50 to 439.72, and the American Stock Exchange market value
index was down 10.22 at 372.23.
   Big Board volume averaged 161.92 million shares a day, down from
172.48 million the week before.
   Of course, a lot of optimism persists that the opening up of
eastern Europe and a new Common Market business alliance in 1992
will help propel worldwide growth past any obstacles that might
arise.
   Tom Marsico, portfolio manager of the Denver-based Janus Twenty
mutual fund, says about 25 percent of his stock holdings are
concentrated in Europe and shares of U.S. companies with a stake in
the opportunities there.
   Though the economic promise of an increasingly democratic Europe
has been widely touted, Marsico takes the view that its full
potential hasn't yet been realized.
   ``We think events there are going to go at a much faster rate
than most people realize,'' he declares.
