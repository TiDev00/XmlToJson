   A teen-ager who fell asleep on the bed
of a woman he raped was arrested after the woman escaped with his
clothes and called police, a detective said.
   ``He had been drinking prior to breaking into the house,'' said
Nashville Sex Abuse Detective Brad Worthington. He said the suspect
broke in through a front window, carried a knife and robbed and
raped the woman.
   The woman, in her late 20s, waited until her attacker fell
asleep, then ran from the room with his clothing, Worthington said.
   ``He was still sound asleep when patrol arrived,'' Worthington
said.
   James E. Winston, 18, who police said was from North Carolina,
was charged with aggravated rape, aggravated robbery and aggravated
burglary. He denied he was involved in the crime.

   A roaming buffalo herd has trampled farm
land and frightened schoolchildren in this central New York town.
   The worst damage was reported at John and Dawn Krewson's tree
farm, where the buffaloes last week destroyed 241 evergreen trees
worth more than $10,000.
   ``They reduced them to toothpicks. It looks like a hurricane or
tornado came through,'' Dawn Krewson said.
   About 10 buffaloes were spotted Thursday walking in the road
toward children waiting for a school bus. The herd wandered into
woods by the time Onondaga County sheriff's deputies arrived,
sheriff's spokesman Robert Burns said.
   He said the herd apparently belongs to the Onondaga Indian
Nation, and Chief Leon Shenandoah was leading a search for the
animals. There was no answer at Shenandoah's telephone number
Thursday.
   ``It's very dangerous,'' said Peggy Holm, who encountered about
15 of the beasts while driving Thursday morning in Lafayette, about
15 miles south of Syracuse. ``I herded them down the road with my
car.''

<TEXT>
   East Germany's interior minister has asked
for an amnesty to give prisoners a fresh start in a united Germany
next month.
   Prisoners demanding amnesty have protested in several jails in
recent days, saying they were unfairly jailed under the previous
Communist regime.
   Pieter-Michael Diestel said Thursday in a statement together
with Vera Wollenberger of the left-leaning Buendnis 90 that the
amnesty should be linked to German unity slated for Oct. 3.
   The appeal to the East German Parliament said the amnesty should
cover prisoners convicted of minor crimes and that those jailed for
major crimes should have their sentences reduced.
   Ms. Wollenberger read the statement to Parliament and cited a
letter from a prisoner asking for the chance to ``attempt a new
beginning in freedom.''

   The number of babies born in Japan last year fell
by 67,204 from a year earlier to a record low 1,246,802, the Health
and Welfare Ministry said.
   The previous low was 1,314,006 in 1988, said a ministry
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Earlier, the ministry said that in 1989, the average Japanese
woman had 1.57 children.
   The official said the average bridegroom was 28.5 years old in
1989, compared with 28.4 years old in 1988, while the average bride
was 25.8 years old, unchanged from 1988.
   The Home Affairs Ministry said last month Japan's population was
122.74 million at the end of March.
   It attributed recent low population growth to the increasing
role of women in the work place and the high cost of educating
children.

   French and U.S. film directors will be able to work
more easily in each others' countries under an agreement with the
Motion Picture and Entertainment Association, Culture Minister Jack
Lang says.
   The agreement, negotiated by Lang and association president Jack
Valenti, is likely to ease the concerns of many French filmmakers
and other artists. They have depicted recently tightened visa
requirements for foreign artists as a sign of increasing American
cultural protectionism.
   ``The idea is to work towards establishing automatic filming
permits, with a minimum of red tape,'' Lang said Thursday after
meeting with Valenti.
   Valenti said the reciprocity agreement was now in the hands of
U.S. unions and signing could take place this fall.
   Lang announced he would visit the United States in November to
attend the French Film Festival in Sarasota, Fla. and inaugurate
the French Music Office in New York.

<HEAD>New Democrats Win Majority in Ontario Election</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with breakdown of seats won by various
parties, comments by Rae, Peterson's resignation; no pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ontario's 6 million voters elected the province's
first socialist majority government Thursday, ousting the Liberals
from power, according to early returns.
   The new government will be the first east of Manitoba led by the
New Democratic Party. The only other NDP government currently in
power is in the Yukon.
   New Democrat Marion Boyd, who runs a women's shelter, defeated
Premier David Peterson, a Liberal, in the district of London Center.
   The Liberals lost more than 50 seats to the New Democrats,
prompting Peterson to announce he would step down as Liberal leader.
   The New Democrats' leader, Bob Rae, won easily in his Toronto
district of York South.
   ``Ours is not a party that is exactly accustomed to winning
elections in Ontario,'' Rae told cheering campaign workers as his
wife, Arlene Perly, stood next to him.
   ``My heart is full of great love and great emotion tonight. I
say to you that I will simply do the best I can.''
   The New Democrats won 74 seats to the Liberals' 35 seats and the
Conservatives' 20. One race was too close to call with a few polls
still left to report. A minimum of 66 seats is needed to form a
majority government.
   Going into the election, the Liberals held a huge majority of 93
seats to the NDP's 18, giving them official Opposition status, and
the Tories 17. There were two vacancies.
   Public opinion polls released in the final week of the campaign
suggested a dramatic shift away from the Liberals and indicated the
New Democrats had the opportunity to form their first government
ever in the province.
   Rae made the Liberal government's integrity a main campaign
issue, and the Liberals focused on constitutional reform.
   Ontario contains one-fourth of Canada's 25 million residents.

   Four members of The Associated Press photography
staff have been named to executive positions.
   ``These changes are part of the department's restructuring as we
approach PhotoStream and the high-speed, digital delivery of the
AP's picture report,'' Vincent Alabiso, the AP's executive photo
editor, said Thursday. ``This management team will work to produce
a more diverse selection of photos tailored to every member's needs
and deadlines.''
   Tom Stathis has been named senior photo editor for North
America, based in New York. His primary responsibility will be to
oversee the AP's newsphoto report from the United States and Canada.
   George Mikulec has been named senior photo editor for
administration and will manage the department's business-related
matters. Based in New York, he also will oversee the operation of
AP's extensive photo library and the New York darkroom.
   Mike Feldman has been named senior photo editor-news in Europe,
Africa and the Middle East. He will be based in London, where he
joins Horst Faas, who becomes senior photo editor-operations in the
same region.
   Faas will help plan and implement the AP's expanding photo
technology and the continuing growth of photo services in the
region.
   Stathis, 36, is a native of New York's Long Island and a
graduate of the University of South Florida. He worked for
newspapers in Tampa and Clearwater, Fla., before joining the AP in
New York in 1981.
   Mikulec, 58, is a native of Herkimer, N.Y., who joined the AP in
New York in 1957. He worked in the photo library before becoming a
photo editor and has been deputy news photo editor since 1982.
   Feldman, 43, worked overseas for Reuters as an assistant
European photo editor and for United Press International as a photo
manager in Philadelphia before joining the AP in New York in 1988.
He is a graduate of Temple University.
   Faas, 57, a native of Berlin, joined the AP in Bonn in 1956. He
worked in Singapore, Frankfurt and Saigon, where he earned a
Pulitzer Prize in 1966 for his coverage of the Vietnam War. He

<DATELINE>ABOARD USS ROBERT G. BRADLEY IN THE PERSIAN GULF (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voices
interject anti-American slogans as the guided missile frigate USS
Robert G. Bradley and its two helicopters intercept vessels in the
Persian Gulf.
   The frigate's skipper, Cmdr. Kevin J. Cosgriff of Binghamton,
N.Y., told The Associated Press his ship was challenging an average
of 10 tankers and freighters a day to enforce the blockade on Iraq,
which invaded Kuwait nealry five weeks ago. Its helicopters check
out almost as many vessels.
   As he spoke, the Greek-flag 52,000-ton tanker Filoxenia appeared
on the horizon. The American warship questioned by radio the other
vessel's last port of call, destination and type of cargo.
   ``We come from Jubail, Saudi Arabia, on our way to (the Saudi
port of) Yanbu with a shipment of gas oil,'' the captain answered.
``We left Jubail on September 5 and we'll arrive in Yanbu on
September 13.''
   Cmdr. Cosgriff signaled the radio officer to thank the Greek and
wish him a nice trip.
   Minutes later, helicopter pilot Lt. Rick Groenenboon reported he
had intercepted six outbound tankers from sunrise to midday.
   Groenenboon of Augusta, Ga., identified the intercepted ships as
two Norwegian, two Iranian, one Belgian and one Japanese.
   Speaking to reporters flown from Manama, Bahrain, to the ship,
he said that radio stations often ``cut in with very impolite
words, sometimes obscene.''
   ``They also say things like Yanks go home. ... Stop this war,''
he added. ``Otherwise the radio exchanges with the (intercepted)
ships are very polite.''
   Cosgriff said this was his third tour of the gulf, having served
twice in the region during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. He
participated in escorting U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in the gulf
at the height of the so-called tanker war.
   He judged the crisis after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait as
``more serious, and I am concerned about aircraft, mines, and
missile capable boats.''
   The frigate has so far not encountered any Iraqi warplanes, he
said, but that ``we are occasionally subjected to reconnaissance
flights by Iranian planes.''
   The 453-foot-long, 3,800-ton Robert G. Bradley is one of nine
U.S. warships involved in interdiction operations to enforce the
U.N. blockade against Iraq.
   Its 200 crewmen would not answer political questions. Those
interviewed said they were carrying out military orders and did not
give much thought to whether the decision to send them to the gulf
was right or wrong.
   They displayed to reporters anti-chemical weapons outfits and
gas masks.

   President Saddam Hussein's best hope of
breaking the stranglehold of U.N. economic sanctions depends on
reaching new terms with old enemies, Western analysts say.
   The embargo is slowly choking Iraq, effectively cut off by
geography and Western warships from life-giving access to the sea.
   Western diplomats and military analysts, speaking on condition
of anonymity, contend that short of war, surrender or compromise,
Saddam's only possible moves are toward Syria and Iran.
   He has been locked in an often bloody ideological feud with
Syrian President Hafez Assad for more than a decade. He fought a
grueling war with Iran between 1980 and 1988, in which an estimated
1 million people were killed.
   ``It's like a chess game. You have to think two, three, four
moves ahead. To see his options, you only have to look at a map,''
one Western diplomat said.
   The U.S.-led naval quarantine denies Iraq the use of its only
two ports, which are at the northern end of the narrow Persian Gulf.
   Saddam's only hope of breaking the sanctions is via the coasts
of Syria and Iran and through convoys of trucks hauling supplies
across their long borders with Iraq, the analysts contend.
   That strategy is complicated by Iraq's relations with Iran and
Syria, which has sent troops to Saudi Arabia to help confront
Saddam's legions.
   Saddam has sought desperately to move closer to Iran. Iraqi
Minister Tariq Aziz will fly to Tehran on Sunday, the first such
visit by an Iraqi official since the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war.
   Saddam ``has shaken hands with Iran, made peace, giving back
territory paid for with Iraqi blood,'' said another Western
diplomat.
   The Iraqi leader proclaimed the gulf war a great Iraqi victory,
even though it was pretty much a draw brought about by mutual
exhaustion. Some Iraqis now ask privately why it was fought.
   Western diplomats and military analysts contend Saddam had no
choice but to make concessions to Iran. They say even if he
persuaded other countries to break sanctions, no significant
quantity of supplies could slip past the gulf barricade and that he
needed to have border openings with Iraq.
   The analysts predict that Saddam has six months, perhaps a year,
before Iraq crumbles under the weight of the sanctions. That
estimate ignores the effect of any food shortages.
   The Americans ``have got him by the throat. And they don't have
to tighten their grip,'' one military analyst said.
   Saddam has tried to rally support in the Arab and Islamic world.
While he has wide popularity with the average Arab, most
governments oppose him.
   In a statement released Wednesday, he called for a holy war
against U.S. forces in the gulf, for the overthrow of governments
that collaborate with the Americans, and for Arab and Islamic
solidarity with Iraq.
   His religious crusade is a marked departure from the secular
ideology of Iraq's ruling Arab Baath Socialist Party and is aimed
in part at moving Iran and Syria.
   A change in Syrian policy toward Iraq is unlikely. Saudi Arabia
is the bankroller for Syria, which has little to gain by ending its
feud with Iraq. Syria and Iraq are ruled by rival wings of the
Baath and have been at loggerheads since Saddam took office in 1979.
   Some diplomats argue Saddam's best hope left is his old enemy
Iran, a country with 50 million people, many of whom harbor fierce
anti-Western sentiment.
   ``Iran already has defied the West,'' one diplomat said. ``And
who would ever ask Iran why it is importing so much wheat?''
   An Iranian newspaper suggested in an editorial Thursday that
Tehran might send food and medicine to Iraq despite the sanctions.
   The Tehran Times, which is close to President Hashemi
Rafsanjani, said: ``Iran is certainly able to solve almost all food
and medicine problems the 16 million population of Iraq is
presently facing.''
   It added: ``The reason lies in the treacherous approach of the
West to Iran during the war.''

<DATELINE>KLEIN MACHNOW, East Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Large and handsome homes line
every shady block in this township southwest of Berlin. To many
residents, it would be difficult to move away. Many fear they may
have to.
   Officials say up to 70 percent of the property here has been
claimed by West Germans who once lived in its quiet neighborhoods.
   With German unification less than a month away, the day is
drawing nearer when those claims _ and up to 1 million others _
will be decided by local committees in scores of towns.
   Such claims are only one aspect of the broader question of how
to decide who owns land that was until recently under the strict
Communist control and, before that, part of prewar Germany.
   The puzzle over property has been blamed for the reluctance of
many businesses to immediately invest in East Germany, which is
scheduled to merge with its capitalist neighbor Oct. 3.
   Billions of dollars in land and buildings are also in the hands
of former Communists, and a special committee has been trying to
track down the property before the old guard strikes it rich on the
real estate market.
   Klein Machnow is one of the prize pieces of residential real
estate in the nation, as well as a favorite of the former elite. It
borders an expensive section of suburban West Berlin and is only a
25-minute drive from the bustling center of the reunifying city.
   The Berlin Wall still runs along two sides of the township. So
far, only a few openings have been made to connect the asphalt
streets of the West with their cobblestone counterparts in the East.
   Many West Germans have been driving through those gaps to look
at the land their parents left them years ago.
   Gerhard Hollman recalled a visit from a West German woman who
claimed her family once own his home in Klein Machnow.
   ``She said, `My family lived here for 20 years.' I said `I've
lived here for 25,''' he said.
   Hollmann, his wife and three children are one of two families
who occupy a sturdy two-story building four doors from the Berlin
Wall.
   He works in a nearby electronics firm struggling to survive and
pays a subsidized rent of $57 a month. If his home were just a
block away, it might cost 20 times that amount.
   ``You go up and down this street and it is the same,'' he said.
``Some West Germans come here and act very aggressively, and say,
`Get out.' Others are nice and say, ``Don't worry, I won't want it
back for perhaps 10 years.' Either way, there is a lot of reason to
worry.''
   The German states have agreed West Germans who once owned East
German land will be allowed to reclaim it, but that no East Germans
will be forced to leave their homes or pay significantly higher
rents.
   There are many unresolved issues, including whether West Germans
can take possession of property in future years or if some
compensation will be available to West Germans claiming land.
   Some East German tenant groups say once West Germans have
control of their old property, East Germans will face increasing
pressure to move out or pay rents they cannot afford.
   The deadline for filing property claims is Oct. 13. Local
communities will then begin determining who gets what.
   The rush by West Germans has shortened tempers.
   In Pritzwalk, an East German was hospitalized with burns after
he snipped an electrical cord of a West German's recreational
vehicle, an Interior Ministry spokesman said. The cord had been
surreptitiously plugged into the East German's home.
   West Germans comprise the largest group of people claiming land,
but by no means the only group.
   A group of East Germans in the city of Schwerin, about 110 miles
northwest of Berlin, is trying to reclaim farmland on what is now
the border between the two nations.
   A number of German Jews also have filed claims on property they
were forced to sell at low prices during the Nazi regime.
   Scores of corporations, both German and foreign, also are eyeing
land and buildings left behind when the Communists nationalized the
nation's industry.
   A treaty signed by the German states Aug. 31 gave businesses
some protection, guaranteeing that land purchased for development
cannot be lost to a previous owner's claim.
   Officials say most of the property being reclaimed is some of
the best. The largest number is in the Berlin area, where there are
40,000 claims.
   Buildings Ministry spokesman Hans Zillig said 40 percent of the
East Berlin's homes have been claimed.
   But Manfred Melzer, a West Berlin economist and specialist in
East German property, said there are still too many unsettled areas.
   Property now is being priced too high by an inexperienced
bureaucracy with limited knowledge of the free market, he said.
   After the hard-line government fell last year, the reform
Communist caretaker government that followed began selling a lot of
property under the table to Communist loyalists at cheap prices.
   Now, many current and former functionaries are believed to be
sitting on real estate goldmines.
   Renate Oeckert and her husband, who works at the former state
petroleum company, said she bought a Klein Machnow home from the
government during the frantic days following the democratic
revolution.
   The red-brick home came complete with a Berlin Wall in the
backyard.
   ``We have no plans to sell it,'' she said. ``We only wanted a
nice place to live. We just hope nobody comes and says it isn't
ours anymore.''

<TEXT>
   A princess who fled Romania 42 years
ago and became a nun is ministering in her beleaguered homeland to
AIDS-infected orphans who sleep three in a bed and die paupers'
deaths.
   ``As always, it is the innocent who suffer,'' said the former
Princess Ileana, now known as the Rev. Mother Alexandra at the
western Pennsylvania monastery she founded in 1967.
   On Monday, the 81-year-old exile and her daughter, Alexandra,
started a weeklong tour of Romania's orphanages, where an estimated
14,000 children were abandoned.
   An archaic practice of giving blood transfusions to sickly
newborns has resulted in at least 687 AIDS cases among Romanian
children, and the World Health Organization estimates thousands
more may be infected with the virus that causes AIDS.
   ``My interest is to arrange something so that the children who
are dying of AIDS should die a humane death,'' said Mother
Alexandra, who has six children of her own. ``They deserve more
than putting them all in one bed and pulling them out one at a time
as they die.''
   Mother Alexandra, the great-granddaughter of England's Queen
Victoria and Czar Alexander II of Russia, fled the family's palace
in the capital of Bucharest just after New Year's Day 1948, about a
week after Communists forced her nephew, King Michael, to abdicate.
   In 1967, she founded the Orthodox Monastery of the
Transfiguration, starting only with a mobile home in Ellwood City
about 50 miles northwest of Pittsburgh. The monastery complex now
has 12 buildings.
   In a recent interview at her monastery home among paintings of
her family and relics of its rule, Mother Alexandra said she
watched with interest last year's overthrow of Romania's Communist
government and the execution of its feared dictator, Nicolae
Ceausescu.
   Ceausescu made AIDS a state secret. His wife, Eleana, who also
was killed by a firing squad last Christmas, was the enforcer of a
ban on contraception and abortions in the nation of 23 million. The
Ceausescus hoped to make the country more powerful by having 30
million people by the year 2000.
   ``The pro-choice people are making a great story out of it,''
Mother Alexandra said. ``There was no family planning, no pill. The
women were forced to have more children than they could feed.''
   Mother Alexandra was invited to Romania by Christiana, a
fledgling relief organization founded by the country's doctors and
priests.
   After her return, she plans to meet with directors of American
charities to gather support for relief efforts.
   ``We need to be able to say, `This is what we need, this is what
we have and this is how we can dispose of it,' '' she said. ``I
have a lot of good will and a lot of faith. I hope to be able to
move others to help.''
   Mother Alexandra speculated an international adoption network
would help some children. She said, however, that such a program
could not place children in the United States, which blocks
immigration of people infected with HIV.
   Mother Alexandra retains a following in Romania in part because
for 30 years she made twice-yearly broadcasts over Radio Free
Europe.
   She said she plans a low-profile visit to avoid the fray between
the government of President Ion Iliescu, which granted her entry,
and the political opposition.
   She's also wary of seeing the many changes that Communist rule
wrought on Romanian landmarks.
   ``I want to remember it the way it was, as my home,'' she said.

   The space shuttle Columbia,
prevented from lifting off early Thursday, holds the record for the
most launch delays. It is also the oldest ship in the fleet.
   Columbia set the mark when it was delayed seven times before a
satellite delivery mission that finally made it off the ground in
January 1986, two weeks before the Challenger accident.
   So far in 1990 only three shuttle missions have lifted off and
with three more scheduled, NASA will fail to meet its goal of nine
flights for the year.
   On Jan. 9, Columbia was launched on a satellite delivery run. It
had been scheduled for liftoff on Dec. 18, but its launch pad was
being refurbished and not ready. A rescheduled launch Jan. 8 was
delayed by bad weather.
   Atlantis was launched Feb. 28 on a secret military mission. It
was originally scheduled for Feb. 22 but was postponed successively
to Feb. 23, 24 and 25 because commander John Creighton had a cold.
On Feb. 25, with the crew in the cockpit, a malfunction in the
range safety computer forced a scrub. The following day there was
another postponement because of bad weather.
   On April 24, Discovery went aloft to place the Hubble Space
Telescope into orbit. The liftoff, originally scheduled for April
18, was actually moved ahead to April 10. But that attempt was
halted with four minutes to go because of a faulty valve in a
hydraulic power unit.
   Columbia, which flew first on April 12, 1981, was to go on its
10th trip into space on May 17, carrying the Astro observatory. But
that date was changed to May 30 because of the Hubble mission was
late. On launch day, engineers found a massive leak of hydrogen
fuel and spent the next three months searching for a cause.
   On Aug. 29, while readying the ship for a Sept. 1 flight, launch
control found it had no communications with one of the telescopes
aboard the shuttle. The mission was rescheduled for Sept. 6, but
the leak reappeared during fueling the night before and caused a
third delay.

   Eagle Scouts be prepared: If you want to collect
letters of recognition from the governors of all 50 states don't
expect much cooperation from Gov. Roy Romer.
   Colorado's governor is standing firm for postal parsimony
despite being taunted by a radio show host as ``Stingy Roy.''
   Jane Nelson, a Romer spokeswoman, said Thursday that the
governor still believes his office cannot afford to send
congratulatory letters to everyone who asks. But it will not be
caught again sending letters explaining that it cannot send letters.
   Now, ``if we respond in a negative fashion to a request, we will
simply send postcards, because they are less costly and more
efficient timewise,'' Nelson said.
   Romer's postage policy took a licking when the parents of scouts
Douglas Baker, 14, of New Milford, N.J., and Derek Kahill, 17, of
Oradell, N.J., solicited letters of recognition from the 50
governors. The boys had become Eagle Scouts, the highest honor for
Boy Scouts.
   Governors from 49 states complied, as did President Bush.
Romer's staff sent letters explaining its no-letter policy. The
boys' families were upset, and George Weber, host of a KOA radio
show called ``The Flip Side,'' took up their cause.
   Weber interviewed the scouts on the air last week and urged
listeners to write to ``Stingy Roy.''
   Romer, who was listening, called in to Weber's program and took
the talk-show host to task in a 20-minute tirade. Romer also
lectured the boys on government responsibility.
   Weber responded: ``Take a sedative, governor.''
   The exchange spurred newspaper editorials and cartoons.
Columnists compared Romer with his predecessor, Richard Lamm, who
was governor from 1974-1986. Although both are Democrats, Romer _
characteristically an upbeat cheerleader for the state _ is not
usually compared to Lamm, who was nicknamed ``Gov. Gloom.''
   Lamm attracted notoriety for his criticism of the use of
expensive technology to keep terminally ill old people alive _ his
1984 ``we've got a duty to die...'' comment.
   While Romer's outburst at Weber lacked such life-and-death
gravity, it did cause enough fallout that he felt obliged to pen
Baker and Kahill an apologetic, five-page letter.
   ``I am writing to you personally so that you may understand my
attitude and feelings about your personal achievement of becoming
Eagle Scouts and about the way my office handled the issue,'' he
wrote.
   Weber claimed victory. But Nelson said the governor's office
letter-writing policy has only been altered slightly as a result of
the episode.

<DATELINE>FORT DIX, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Not too long ago, the future of Fort Dix
appeared bleak. But the Persian Gulf crisis has brought a renewed
sense of purpose at the sprawling army base.
   Base personnel and critics of a plan to scale back operations at
Fort Dix are feeling just a bit smug now that the base is playing a
major role in mobilizing Army reserve units for deployment in
Operation Desert Shield.
   ``It shows the military importance of Fort Dix,'' said Rep.
James Saxton, R-N.J. ``If we are to have a large mobilization of
National Guard or Army Reserve forces, Fort Dix is just the base
for that.
   ``This is the kind of thing that we said over and over again
that Fort Dix would be important for,'' Saxton said.
   The hatchet fell on Fort Dix last year when Congress approved a
massive cost-cutting plan. A federal commission recommended closing
86 military bases and scaling back five more, including central New
Jersey's Fort Dix, about 30 miles east of Philadelphia.
   An Army spokesman, Lt. Col. Joseph Allread, said the increased
activity resulting from Operation Desert Shield will not alter the
ultimate fate of the targeted bases.
   ``It doesn't change the base closure mandate which we have,''
Allread said. ``When we come through this current situation, they
will still be moved towards closure.''
   The plans call for the elimination of basic training operations
_ boot camp _ for Army recruits at the fort by October 1992. The
base's 3,800 civilian work force was expected to be trimmed by
about one-third by the cutbacks. The base also employs about 8,900
members of the military.
   New Jersey politicians attempted, unsuccessfully, to derail the
plan. And the base's role in the Persian Gulf crisis isn't likely
to change the plan.
   But it has provided a validation of the base's importance, at
least in the minds of those laboring there.
   Capt. Dwayne Lacewell, who commands an engineer battalion placed
on alert, said the mood at Fort Dix is noticeably more upbeat these
days.
   ``I think it should bring to light that Fort Dix has a viable
mission in the force structure,'' Lacewell said. ``Obviously Fort
Dix is an integral element in providing soldiers to the force.''
   The arrival of reservists at Fort Dix last week was widely
publicized, and that, said base spokeswoman Rebecca Wriggle, puffed
out the chests of more than a few soldiers and civilian workers.
   ``Having a chance to do something that you prepare every day to
do is a good feeling,'' Wriggle said last week.
   Fort Dix, which was established in 1917, will remain an active
center for reserve and National Guard training, Wriggle said, and
maintain its function of processing soldiers whose term of duty is
completed.
   ``There are a number of things that will continue,'' Wriggle
said. ``The major thing that is changing is that we will lose our
initial army entry training function.''
   And Fort Dix will continue as a mobilization center for Army
reserve units.
   However, Wriggle said no one was kidding themselves that the
recent reserve activity would somehow save the fort's boot camp.
   ``It is a stretch to think that it will affect the future of
Fort Dix,'' she said. ``The realignment is a matter of public law
now.''

   Charlie Sheen, ending a month of
rehabilitation in a drug and alcohol abuse center today, says drugs
are the ``proverbial toboggan ride to hell.''
   Sheen, 25, checked himself into the rehabilitation center, which
wasn't identified, on Aug. 9 for what his publicist, Jeff Ballard,
called ``severe exhaustion due to an arduous filming schedule of
four features back-to-back.''
   Now, Ballard said, ``He's fine.''
   The son of actor Martin Sheen and brother of actor Emilio
Estevez hasn't identified what substances he was abusing. He said
on CBS-TV's ``Face to Face With Connie Chung'' that he had ``tasted
the fruits. I gnawed some beef, as it were.''
   He also told Chung drugs are the ``proverbial toboggan ride to
hell.''
   Sheen's recent movie appearances include ``Navy SEALS,'' ``Men

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the most popular stops on the campaign
trail this year is the Saudi Arabian desert.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., showcased his chairmanship of the
Foreign Relations Committee by leading a delegation to the Persian
Gulf last weekend.
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., was seen on local television
interviewing home-state soldiers in the gulf. And Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., greeted voters in a USS Wisconsin hat upon his return.
   With the country in the grip of a Middle East crisis, candidates
are racing to demonstrate their patriotism and support for the U.S.
military.
   The themes are traditionally Republican and would appear to
favor that party's candidates. But the unstable international
situation makes voters less apt to throw out incumbents _ most of
whom are Democrats.
   At least one GOP incumbent stands to gain from the gulf
confrontation _ Helms, a diehard conservative facing a tough
challenge from Democrat Harvey Gantt, the black former mayor of
Charlotte, N.C.
   Gantt champions education and environmental concerns, and
criticizes Helms for opposing spending in those areas. The gulf
situation allows Helms to divert attention to the kind of federal
spending he does support _ defense.
   In a new Helms ad, a narrator talks about Iraq's Saddam Hussein,
his chemical weapons and the U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia. ``Should
we cut defense $300 billion?'' the voice asks. Helms says no, Gantt
says yes, the narrator explains.
   Gantt made the proposal long before Iraq invaded Kuwait and says
he still believes the money can be saved over the next five to
eight years or longer. But he adds, ``I think the voters understand
very clearly that Harvey Gantt stands behind the president and
stands behind our troops.''
   Gantt is not the only candidate who has been forced on the
defensive by the gulf crisis. Many who have promoted Pentagon cuts
or voiced reservations about the U.S. role in the gulf are finding
themselves vulnerable to attack.
   In Oregon, for example, GOP Rep. Denny Smith is accusing his
Democratic challenger, Mike Kopetski, of ``cozying up to Saddam
Hussein'' and promoting appeasement tactics that didn't stop Hitler.
   Kopetski, who nearly toppled Smith in 1988, did say he opposed
military action and hoped the Iraqi aggression ``wouldn't go any
further than Kuwait.'' However, the remarks were made the same day
as the invasion and Kopetski has since said he supports President
Bush's moves.
   Smith's strategy could backfire in the end. Editorial writers
across Oregon are criticizing him for opportunist and offensive
campaign tactics.
   The gulf crisis has become a significant factor in other races
as well _ including Senate contests in Iowa, Michigan, Illinois and
Nebraska, where three Republican representatives and a former
congressman are trying to oust four Democratic incumbents.
   In Nebraska, former Rep. Hal Daub pounced on Sen. James Exon for
expressing reluctance to engage U.S. troops in combat in the gulf
region. In Iowa, meanwhile, Rep. Tom Tauke said Sen. Tom Harkin's
questions about whether Bush needed to call up the reserves were
``either tragically misinformed or blatant opportunism.''
   Rep. Lynn Martin ridiculed Illinois' dovish Sen. Paul Simon as
``an election-year macho man'' for urging last month that Iraqi oil
pipelines be bombed. And in Michigan, Rep. Bill Schuette has
attacked Levin for past votes against conventional weapons.
   But the senators are fighting back with trips to the Persian
Gulf, news clips of them with the troops, talk show appearances,
op-ed newspaper pieces and emphasis on any relevant positions of
authority _ in Levin's case, his chairmanship of the conventional
forces and alliance defense subcommittee.
   The crisis would seem to be a windfall for Pell, who is facing a
spirited challenge from Rep. Claudine Schneider in Rhode Island.
   In his role as Foreign Relations Committee chairman, Pell has
been on television and op-ed pages and he led a delegation to Saudi
Arabia just before Congress reconvened.
   But his flurry of activity came only after Schneider's campaign
had needled him for weeks about his failure to respond quickly to
the gulf crisis.
   ``It's interesting that nearly a month went by and you did not
see him really sought after or showing up on CNN or the networks or
major papers as a voice. Why aren't people asking him?'' said Wendy
Burnley, a spokeswoman for the National Republican Senatorial
Committee.
   Anita Dunn, Burnley's counterpart at the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee, scoffed at such criticism. The Schneider
campaign's ``test of whether Pell is an effective Foreign Relations
chairman is how many times he's seen on TV nationally. That's not
the best, most valid test,'' she said.

   Iran hanged 57 alleged drug traffickers
and arrested 700 suspected smugglers and addicts in a five-day
nationwide sweep, Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, said Thursday that nine men
were hanged in western Hamedan province and 48 were executed in the
city of Mashhad in northeastern Iran.
   IRNA said law enforcement agents seized 1 ton of narcotics in
the sweep that began Saturday. Some of those executed were charged
with possessing as little an ounce of heroin.
   The state-run Iranian media have reported more than 1,500
drug-related executions since December 1988 and arrests of over
50,000 addicts.
   Iranian opposition groups allege that drug-related executions
are used to mask killings of political opponents.

   NASA plans to replace a
softball-sized fuel pump this weekend to get shuttle Columbia ready
for a fourth try at carrying an astronomical observatory into space
in mid-September.
   ``This has been a troublesome and vexing summer for me and for
NASA,'' Richard Truly, NASA's administrator, said Thursday. ``But
let me just remind everybody that running the space program ... is
not an ordinary business. We push the boundaries of human activity,
flying in space, and it's a hard job.''
   The new target date for the thrice-scrubbed launch will be early
in the week of Sept. 17. That, Truly said, will let the Astro
mission proceed without affecting the next flight, which must begin
between Oct. 5 and Oct. 23.
   Space engineers, following a vapor trail of clues, said the pump
was the leading suspect for the hydrogen leaks that canceled
Thursday's scheduled launch. They will not be sure until they open
the aft compartment of the shuttle on Saturday and remove a
``package'' that includes three of the pumps, one for each engine.
   The swap itself will take only two days, according to officials,
but retesting and all the other steps required before a countdown
can begin will take up the rest of the week.
   All along, NASA has said that Columbia must be on its way before
Sept. 14, so that launch crews can turn their attention to
Discovery, sitting on a neighboring launch pad.
   But the officials say now that was a ``soft'' date, subject to
change. In any event, the Discovery flight is likely to be delayed
several days because of a problem in its cooling system.
   Discovery will carry into orbit a space probe that then will be
launched toward the sun, with a velocity boost gained by flying
past the planet Jupiter. Only in the 19-day period will the
alignment of Earth and Jupiter permit that boost.
   Columbia's leak problem first surfaced on May 29 while the
shuttle was being fueled for the first attempt to launch the $150
million Astro observatory. After scrubbing the flight, engineers
thought the hydrogen leaked from a plumbing connector between the
orbiter and its fuel tank.
   Hydrogen also was detected in the aft compartment. William
Lenoir, head of NASA's space flight program, said engineers
concluded at the time ``that perhaps half that leak was drawn into
the aft compartment and the other part went external.''
   He said engineers found no separate cause for the leak in the
compartment, which houses a maze of pipes, valves and pumps, ``but
we could not conclusively say we did not have yet a second leak
that was in the aft compartment.''
   On Wednesday evening, however, engineers found the opposite to
be true. Columbia had two leaks in May, and only one had been
fixed, the one around the plumbing connection.

   Countries are pledging millions of dollars to buy
food and otherwise ease conditions in Jordan's overcrowded refugee
camps, but relief agencies say more is needed and those stranded
must be repatriated.
   Since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait 605,300 evacuees have
crossed into Jordan, the official Jordanian news agency Petra
reported.
   The majority have left Jordan, but relief officials estimate
more than 100,000 Bangladeshis, Pakistanis, Indians, Sri Lankans,
Thais and Filipinos remain.
   Japan today announced an additional $12 million to help Asian
evacuees.
   Britain on Thursday earmarked $3.8 million more in refugee aid.
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told the House of Commons the
grant brought the British government contribution to $10 million.
   Sweden, Denmark and Norway have together pledged $14 million in
relief aid. Finland has pledged $2.5 million and Italy $3.4 million.
   European Community foreign ministers meeting in Rome today
planned to consider emergency aid to Jordan, the Italian Foreign
Ministry said.
   The United Nations has sent more than 3,000 tons of food and
supplies to Jordan and received $19 million in aid, mainly from
Japan and Sweden, said Robert Souria, a U.N. relief official.
   ``The international community needs to send more,'' Souria said.
   The European Commission on Wednesday authorized about $19
million for relief, mostly for chartering aircraft.
   Humanitarian agencies applauded the donations but said the top
priority was to send home the refugees fleeing Kuwait and Iraq.
   ``The aid agencies have said that there are ways of getting
foreign nationals out. Scheduled flights are leaving Amman with
empty seats on them,'' Martin Cottingham, spokesman for Christian
Aid, said Thursday in London.
   Oxfam press officer Anna Feuchtwang said the agency has provided
$475,000 worth of aid.
   ``I think we are doing as much as we can. The problem is, what
Oxfam can do, what any charitable organization can do, is really
not enough.
   ``What really needs to happen is for governments to help people
to get out of Jordan, out of the refugee camps,'' Ms. Feuchtwang
said.
   Richard Wright, a senior official with the International Red
Cross in Geneva, said they are concerned that developing countries
may not be able to absorb the large number of nationals fleeing the
region.
   ``We can't afford to have another Hong Kong, where the
`temporary' camps built 10 years ago to house Vietnamese boat
people are still full,'' Wright said.
   The first of 10 flights organized by the government of
Bangladesh returned to Dhaka on Thursday with 160 Bangladeshis. The
flights are carrying a total of 1,200 tons of rice to Jordan,
Bangladesh said.
   About 110,000 Bangladeshis were working in Iraq and Kuwait when
the invasion took place.
   A British Airways jet left London Thursday with tents and 200
bales of blankets for Jordan, Christian Aid said. The Foreign
Office said it was expected to pick up Britons evacuated by Kuwait.
   The International Organization for Migration said it would begin
a 72-flight airlift to evacuate 19,000 stranded people on Thursday.
The Geneva-based intergovernmental organization said the airflift
would cost about $12 million.

   President Bush is appealing directly to the
Iraqi people for support to end the Persian Gulf crisis as he
renews a blistering attack on their president and prepares for a
weekend superpower summit.
   ``We Americans should make something very clear _ our argument
is not with the people of Iraq,'' Bush told a Republican rally in
Tallahassee, Fla., on Thursday night. ``Rather it is with Iraq's
dictator who uses innocent travelers as shields, who now, in direct
contravention of international law, holds hostage civilians from
many countries.''
   He said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein ``must know that our
policy ... will not be altered by this brazen blackmail'' and that
the United States will maintain its military buildup in the region
and enforcement of the international economic sanctions against
Iraq.
   However, Bush told reporters traveling with him on a one-day
political trip that he was glad for Saddam's offer of airtime to
televise a message to the Iraqi people.
   The president called it ``a real opportunity.'' He has
previously voiced a desire to take his case to the Iraqi people, as
Saddam has done to Americans, with hours of his speeches and
appearances broadcast live on U.S. news programs.
   White House officials said Bush will tape a message of about 10
minutes, probably next Wednesday after his address Tuesday to a
joint session of Congress on the Persian Gulf situation.
   Press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the White House would put
together the tape and then have a State Department translation
made. ``We'll do the whole thing ourselves,'' he said in reference
to the Iraqi offer of a TV crew to travel to Washington and
interview Bush.
   Iraqi Ambassador Mohamed al-Mashat said that ``of course'' Iraqi
TV would air Bush's message ``in its entirety without editing. Here
you edit, in Iraq we do not edit.''
   Bush will explain on the tape why the United States has sent
thousands of troops and air and sea power to the gulf in the wake
of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, officials said.
   The president's statements Thursday about having no quarrel with
Iraqis were reminiscent of the language he used in remarks about
Panama before the December U.S. invasion to oust dictator Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   Bush leaves tonight for Helsinki, Finland, to discuss the
Persian Gulf and other matters with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev on Sunday. He also will press the Soviet leader for a
quick resolution to strategic arms reduction talks that have been
going on for eight years.
   Preparing for the summit, Bush consulted Thursday morning with
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, Turkish President Turgut Ozal,
French President Francois Mitterrand and West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, Fitzwater said.
   The president also met Thursday with Israel's visiting foreign
minister, David Levy before embarking on a day of politicking in
Florida and Kansas.
   He used the political swing to issue a rallying cry for his
Middle East policy as well as raise money for Republican candidates
and praise U.S.-Soviet cooperation, which he said can deepen with
this Sunday's summit.
   ``The world is united against this aggression,'' by Iraq, Bush
told the Florida rally for Rep. Bill Grant. ``And I'm glad the
Soviet Union is on our side on this one.''
   ``And there is no substitute for the support of the American
people,'' he said. ``I need you support and I hope I have it as we
continue to stand up against aggression in the Middle East.''
   Earlier he told a Kansas luncheon for Gov. Mike Hayden that the
United States will see through its goal of forcing Saddam Hussein
out of Kuwait.
   ``There is nothing I want more than for our American servicemen
and women to come home _ and they will once we've completed a
mission that does right by America, and the world,'' Bush said.
   Bush's trip Thursday marked his first flight on the new Air
Force One, a specially equipped Boeing 747 that replaced his aging
Boeing 707.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gun control supporters are calling for a
nationwide ban on bringing firearms within 1,000 feet of schools,
but federal officials say it would be virtually impossible to
enforce.
   ``Passage of this bill will enable our children and their
teachers to travel to and from ... schools without an overriding
fear for their personal safety,'' Cleveland police Chief Edward P.
Kovacic said Thursday.
   He urged the House Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on crime
to approve the bill, which is similar to provisions included in an
omnibus crime package already approved by the Senate.
   Bringing a gun within 1,000 yards of a schoolyard would be
punishable by a maximum five-year sentence under the measure.
   The bill reflects growing concern over gun incidents on school
grounds in recent years, including multiple slayings of youngsters
by deranged individuals in Stockton, Calif., and Winnetka, Ill.
   ``Those incidents, while celebrated, are not isolated,'' said
Rep. Edward F. Feighan, D-Ohio, bill's sponsor.
   On Thursday, at the same time the congressional hearing was
taking place, an armed high school sophomore held nine classmates
hostage for more than five hours at a school in Cumming, Ga. He
surrendered after growing dizzy, and no one was injured.
   The bill would provide exceptions for weapons on private
property, licensed by the state after a background check of the
owner, unloaded and kept in a locked container in a vehicle or
carried by a school guard.
   Concern that the bill could not be enforced, however, was
expressed by Richard Cook, chief of the firearms division in the
Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. He
said the bureau has 1,800 special agents nationwide to enforce
scores of laws under its jurisdiction.
   ``Our firearms enforcement activities are focused on violent
criminals and illegal drug traffickers,'' he said.
   ``As you can see from these numbers and the law enforcement
demands placed upon us, ATF could not provide direct protection to
all of the nation's schools and could not be expected to be the
first line of defense against guns and violence in schools,'' Cook
added.
   Local police should take the lead in enforcing gun laws around
schools with support from the bureau, he said.
   Subcommittee Chairman William J. Hughes, D-N.J. also expressed
some doubts on whether the bureau would have sufficient agents to
enforce such a measure.
   ``We're lucky if we can inspect a firearms dealer once in 15
years at this point,'' Hughes said.
   ``I'm just curious what this bill adds to your arsenal other
than a lot of problems at this point,'' said Rep. Chuck Douglas,
R-N.H. He said the ``answer is a metal detector and not some law
that can't be enforced anyway.''
   According to a report distributed at the hearing by the Center
to Prevent Handgun Violence, at least 71 people have been killed
with guns at school nationwide over the last four years. The report
said six were employees and the rest were students.
   The report said 201 individuals were severely wounded and 242
held hostage at gunpoint. It said gang disputes were responsible
for 18 percent of gun violence in the schools, romantic
disagreements for 12 percent, ``longstanding arguments'' for 15
percent, fights over material possessions for 10 percent and
accidents for 13 percent.

   Gordon Humphrey, who was unbeatable as a
U.S. senator, may have trouble getting elected to the New Hampshire
Senate.
   The popular Humphrey, who opposes abortion, faces state Rep.
Jack Sherburne in Tuesday's Republican primary and some say an
upset is a genuine possibility.
   ``I think (Sherburne) has a shot at this, which is amazing,''
says Peg Dobbie, state director of the National Abortion Rights
Action League, which supports the pro-choice Sherburne.
   The election ``could go either way'' and likely will be decided
by political and abortion activists if the turnout is as low as
expected, says Republican Executive Councilor Peter Spaulding.
   Two years ago, 4,444 people voted in the Republican primary.
Sherburne believes at least 2,000 more will vote because of the
media attention given the race.
   The Republican incumbent, William Johnson, who is pro-choice, is
running for Congress. But Humphrey, 49, of Chichester, has the
enormous advantage of nearly universal name recognition in the
state after 12 years in Washington. In an unusual move, he gave up
almost certain re-election because he believes senators should be
limited to two terms.
   By contrast, Sherburne, 67, a retired Air Force fighter pilot,
is little known outside his hometown of Deerfield. In 1970, he
retired to his farm where he grows corn, apples and Christmas
trees, raises chickens and sells firewood.
   He served 12 years as a selectman and eight in the Legislature.
Last year, he championed an ethics bill opposed by Republican
legislative leaders.
   Humphrey is trying to cash in on his name recognition with bold
blue and white campaign signs that read: ``Senator Humphrey.''
   ``He's not particularly experienced in state politics, but
there's this idea that he's somehow more deserving as a U.S.
senator,'' Sherburne said.
   ``We realized when we started that name recognition was going to
be the big thing,'' Sherburne added. ``We're still out there
fighting.''
   To combat Humphrey's advantage, NARAL, Dobbie's pro-choice
organization, has set up a telephone bank to contact voters who
haven't heard of Sherburne.
   To counter spending by abortion rights forces, Humphrey
spearheaded formation of an anti-abortion political action
committee, Heartbeat New Hampshire. It raised $24,000 by early
September _ all but $1,000 from out-of-state contributors. Humphrey
said the group is contacting voters in other Senate districts as
well as his.
   NARAL raised $20,000 to spend on all races, $5,000 from out of
state.
   Sherburne and Humphrey each has raised about $14,000. But
Humphrey, unlike Sherburne, has refused to be bound by the $15,000
voluntary state spending limit for the primary, saying late
spending by abortion-rights advocates could force him to respond.
   Sherburne has placed ads in weekly newspapers questioning why
Humphrey would give up a federal seat with a salary of $98,400 to
run for a $100-a-year, largely volunteer job.
   ``Why does he think we need a self-appointed savior from out of
state?'' the ad asks. It then cites Sherburne's service as a
legislator and selectman, and his position on abortion.
   Humphrey has said he'd like to run for governor, but not while
his friend, Republican Judd Gregg, holds the office. He also says
the state's ``conservative character is being eroded'' and needs
conservatives like himself to rebuild it.
   While acknowledging that name recognition helps, Humphrey said
he's taking nothing for granted.
   He's campaigned everywhere from dumps on Saturday mornings to
judging a cow-chip bingo contest for charity.
   Humphrey also is trying to capitalize on his skinflint
reputation in the U.S. Senate to win support from unhappy property
owners who've seen their taxes skyrocket in the past decade.
   He proposes letting communities disregard some state regulations
that add to property taxes and letting towns give tax credits to
parents who send children to private schools.
   Sherburne agrees that property taxes can be eased by eliminating
some education requirements, but he said Humphrey goes too far.
``All he says is fight taxes. That's too simplistic.''
   The mostly rural district is comprised of 14 small towns between
Concord and the densely populated seacoast.
   Voters interviewed at random in the district Monday were more
worried about the Middle East crisis than the Senate race. Many
were unaware of the race, and others were paying little attention
to it. The few who knew how they would vote cited personal ties
rather than issues.
   ``I think people are going to back Jack because they know him. I
know he'll listen. I know I can get to him and that counts,'' said
Deerfield librarian Evelyn Cronyn.

<HEAD>New Corporation Promises World's Largest Oil Spill Cleanup
Operation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new corporation is promising to become the
world's largest oil spill cleanup operation.
   Marine Spill Response Corp. President John D. Costello announced
Thursday his company will spend an estimated $800 million over the
next five years to set up and operate a system to clean up U.S.
waters and scour beaches around the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and
the Gulf of Mexico as well as areas around outlying islands in the
event of major oil spills.
   The non-profit company is to be funded by the oil industry, but
it will operate independently, and spills will have to pay for its
services, Costello said at a news conference.
   The cost is three times the original estimate of a petroleum
industry task force that set up the corporation.
   Costello said increases in the estimates were necessary to do
the job.
   The company plans to construct five regional centers in areas
where major oil spills are most likely to occur: the New York-New
Jersey area; Port Everglades, Fla., north of Miami; Lake Charles,
La., near the Texas border; Port Hueneme, Calif., north of Los
Angeles, and Seattle, Wash.
   Missing from the list is Alaska, where the nation's worst spill
occurred March 24, 1989. Costello said the vastly improved spill
response capability in Alaska is now greater than it will be at any
of the corporation's regional centers. However, he said Marine
Spill Response is negotiating to work out what role it might play
in Alaska.
   In addition to the regional centers, the corporation will have
vessels at about nine other sites, said Costello, a retired Coast
Guard vice admiral.
   ``We're excited by the prospect of creating the world's largest,
best-equipped and best-trained oil spill cleanup organization,'' he
said.
   Each regional center will have the ability to handle a spill
roughly as large as the record 11-million-gallon spill of crude oil
from the Exxon Valdez in Alaska's Prince William Sound, he said.
Regional centers can combine forces to handle even larger spills.
   The corporation expects to spend $315 million on initial
equipment, including ships, trucks, booms, skimmers, dispersants
and tools for dealing with wildlife and damaged shorelines.
   The company, with about 400 employees, will administer spill
response but will contract most of the work out to scores of other
companies, Costello said.
   The company was set up to fulfill the terms of federal oil spill
legislation signed by President Bush last month. The law gives oil
companies until February 1993 to show they can contain and clean up
a worst-case oil spill.
   Costello said the new company would be fully operational by then
and could provide some limited response even earlier.
   The oil spill law also increased the liability of shippers from
a ceiling of $150 per gross ton of the tanker to $1,200 per gross
ton.
   Costello said liability laws in some states should be changed to
allow for a quick response to oil spills. He said that although his
company would have no problem, because it is a non-profit
corporation, its subcontractors might be inhibited.

<HEAD>US-Soviet Security Join Forces To Safeguard Summit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATTI HUUHTANEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Finnish police say they were caught off
guard when they were told less than a week ago to prepare for
Sunday's superpower summit, but U.S. and Soviet security agencies
have joined forces to help them.
   Police Chief Olli Urponen said the summit, while a surprise, was
made easier by the experience of other recent visits to Helsinki by
U.S. and Soviet leaders.
   ``Of course it's been a great help to have worked with the
Americans and Soviets before on similar occasions,'' he said.
   In 1988, Finnish police worked with U.S. Secret Service agents
when President Reagan made a brief stopover on his way to a Moscow
summit with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Eleven months ago,
they joined forces with Gorbachev's KGB agents during the Soviet
leader's three-day official visit.
   ``President Gorbachev's visit and President Reagan's visit form
a basis for the security arrangements of this (summit),'' Urponen
said. ``But each event is absolutely its own ... and we have to
make security arrangements accordingly.''
   On Thursday, Soviet and U.S. security agents met at the
President's Palace, site of Sunday's one-day summit meeting.
Urponen said Finnish, American and Soviet security agents have held
several meetings during the week of summit preparations.
   He refused to comment on details of the U.S.-Soviet security
cooperation. U.S. and Soviet summit advance team personnel refused
to discuss questions related to the summit security arrangements.
   Seppo Tiitinen, Chief of Security Police, who is in charge of
joint operations, said there were no hierarchy problems and that
Finnish police would ``play the coordinating role.''
   ``No direct threats have been made against this summit. There is
no threat ... apart from the general threat of terrorism,''
Tiitinen said.
   Both Urponen and Tiitinen declined to speculate on whether
Finnish President Mauno Koivisto's criticism of Iraq on Wednesday
increased the danger of a terrorist attack.
   Koivisto, in a pre-summit interview, accused Iraq of wasting
natural resources on weapons for war instead of helping the poor.
It is unusual for a Finnish president to speak out on such issues.
   He said police officers, cars and equipment had been called into
use from other cities and all able-bodied Helsinki police have been
placed on duty for the weekend.
   In 1975, 35 world leaders met in the Finnish capital to sign the
Helsinki Final Act of the Conference On Security and Cooperation in
Europe. Urponen said the security job would be easier if police had
the special powers Finland's parliament granted them temporarily
during that 1975 meeting.
   The powers allowed police to stop people on the street and
search houses if they suspected any danger for those attending the
meeting.
   The special powers were criticized on constitutional grounds.
They required a two-thirds majority of Finland's parliament, which
is not in session this week.

   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev will not
condone the use of force to solve the gulf crisis but probably
would ``reluctantly look the other way'' if President Bush decided
that was the only answer, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato says.
   D'Amato, the New York Republican, made the prediction Thursday,
a day after meeting with Soviet leader.
   D'Amato has for weeks expressed doubt that the Persian Gulf
crisis will be resolved without the use of force and has advocated
the ouster of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein by bombing him ``off
the face of the Earth.''
   D'Amato was part of a seven-member Senate delegation that
traveled to the Middle East, Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
   The meeting with Gorbachev and other Soviet leaders covered a
number of topics, including the Soviet Union's economic future and
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, D'Amato said.
   ``I don't believe that we're ever going to see the Soviets call
for the use (of force), unless extraordinary developments take
place, such as Soviet hostage-taking of their citizens, etc.,''
D'Amato said. ``However, at a certain point in time, if the
president feels it is absolutely essential, then Gorbachev will
reluctantly look the other way.''
   On the question of U.S. aid, D'Amato said Gorbachev mentioned
his desire for ``most-favored nation'' trading status and technical
assistance from the United States.
   However, D'Amato said, Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., asked Gorbachev
how the United States could justify such assistance when the
Soviets are sending $3 billion to $5 billion a year to Cuba and
billions more to Vietnam.
   ``He (Gorbachev) said, `Our relations are undergoing change _
Cuba, Afghanistan, Vietnam,''' D'Amato recalled. ``He said, `In the
future we will be talking about trade and considering financial aid
within the context of trade, not aid.'''
   Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian republic, was even more
direct, D'Amato said.
   ``He said, `There is no way that we can or should be providing
economic aid to other countries when we are in such dire straits.'''
   Gorbachev has condemned Iraq's invasion and annexation of Kuwait
and cut off Soviet arms shipments to Iraq. But he has balked at
joining a naval blockade to enforce a U.N. economic embargo on Iraq.

   ``The Soldiers Manual of Common Tasks''
is the Army's camouflage-covered bible, a compendium of instruction
on everything from digging a foxhole to knocking out a tank.
   While it doesn't offer much in the way of plot, it is the book
the 265th Quartermaster Detachment is reading these days.
   It is studied while waiting for chow, while resting in the
barracks, while riding in the canvas-backed pickup trucks.
   The 14 members of the South Carolina National Guard water
purification unit are studying hard for their final exam:
deployment to the Mideast.
   No one seems to mind the homework.
   ``I'm glad for the training,'' said Spec. Bobby Youmans, 29.
``You can't give me too much. The more we train, the more we're
ready.''
   All this education suits Youmans, an officer at the Allendale
Correctional Facility who has been in the Guard 11 years.
   Youmans has been to several National Guard schools, studying
things like field telephone systems and refrigeration.
   ``I'm a jack-of-all-trades and a master of none,'' he said.
   His education is just part of the benefits of his guard
membership. He not only learns a trade, he is paid for attending
the school.
   Before his call-up, he planned to go to college with the help of
the Guard's college program.
   ``You have to take advantage of what you can to improve
yourself,'' he said.
   For now, self-improvement takes the form of classes in radio
operations, compass reading, chemical warfare and small arms.
   Even the classes' location fits the curriculum. The men spend
the afternoon in the humid heat of an open field to prepare bodies
for desert temperatures.
   The first aid class is working on a life-size rubber mannequin
with moveable simulated wounds. Rubberized arms and legs are
swathed in different combinations of dressings and gauze as the
instructor offers comment.
   ``Keep talking to him,'' he says, referring to the dummy. ``Tell
him he's going to be all right. Get him mad. Tell him if he doesn't
make it, you're going to get to know his girlfriend. You want to
get him angry.''
   ``But make sure you get his M-16 and pistol first,'' says Sgt.
Hullie Cohen.
   The instructor tells a first aid story about his basic training
when a soldier threw himself out a high window. The man survived
with cuts and a broken leg. Instead of getting a discharge, the man
was sent through basic again.
   ``The commander said he didn't want to lose anybody crazy enough
to jump out a third floor window,'' the instructor explains.
   Further down the field another squad of men strip down their new
M-16 rifles. The men sweat heavily and the instructor stops class
often for the men to drink from canteens _ another lesson harped on
constantly.
   As has happened throughout the day, the instructor suddenly
calls ``Gas,'' and the men drop the weapons and pull on gas masks.
   Next comes a field problem: How do the men know when it's safe
to take the masks off?
   ``Use your M256,'' say the men, referring to a small test kit
that detects poison gas.
   ``You don't have one,'' says the instructor.
   ``You ask for a volunteer,'' says Sgt. Bill Bostick, reciting
the next step.
   ``Before you ask for a volunteer, you better make sure your
weapon is locked and loaded so if the man you ask to volunteer
doesn't want to you can shoot him,'' said the instructor. ``It
sounds hard but you've got to think of the rest of the unit.''
   So Bostick, a brick mason, ``asks'' Henry Harris, the retired
school teacher, to volunteer. Harris tentatively unseals. There is,
of course, nothing wrong with the air other than a swarm of gnats.
   The men practice waiting the prescribed 10 minutes and when
Harris doesn't fall over, they too remove their masks.
   ``We'll make sure we got plenty M256s,'' Bostick tells Harris.

<HEAD>Countries Line Up Behind Egypt for Debt Forgiveness</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poland has at least as strong a claim for
forgiveness of its U.S. debts as Egypt, which President Bush wants
to reward for its help in the Persian Gulf, a senior member of
Congress contends.
   The Poles are throwing off the shackles of communism imposed,
with U.S. acquiescence, after World War II, said Rep. David Obey,
D-Wis. They are suffering hardship while they seek to establish a
market economy, a reform whose success is crucial to the outcome of
Eastern Europe's dramatic changes.
   Before going along with Bush's plan to let Egypt off the hook
for $7 billion in past military loans, ``I want to know what's
happening with respect to Poland,'' which owes the United States
some $3 billion, Obey said in an interview.
   Analysts say other countries are lining up for similar treatment
at a time when wiping away debts, even uncollectable ones, will
make more difficult the task of struggling U.S. budget negotiators.
   ``In reality, everyone else who owes money already is calling
for similar treatment,'' said Robert Hunter, an analyst at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies.
   Lawmakers fear opening a door they may not be able to close
again quickly, and the White House has yet to offer a detailed
explanation of why Egypt deserves help that should be denied to
other allies.
   ``I am not about to support at this point making a single
exception for one country without knowing what the rest of the game
plan is going to be,'' said Obey, whose Appropriations foreign aid
subcommittee will be a central player in the debate over forgiving
Egypt's debt.
   Of the total official foreign debt owed the United States,
nearly $20 billion is for past sales of military equipment.
   Much of that amount also is owed by countries who can claim
that, like Egypt, they have bee helpful in the Persian Gulf crisis
or have crippling debt burdens. Others might make the claim on a
simple ``me, too'' basis.
   ``I want to know the administration's plans with respect to
Israel, and to Pakistan ...,'' Obey said, naming some of those
considered most likely to line up behind Egypt.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, Obey's Senate counterpart, named Turkey,
Greece, Morocco and the Philippines as other major debtors that
might seek relief, and expressed alarm over the lack of a clear
policy from the administration.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater has asserted that Egypt
is ``a special case, and it's not open season on this kind of
request.'' But there has been no detailed public explanation to
back up that assertion.
   Egypt is the largest single debtor in the category of U.S.
military loans, with an outstanding debt of $6.7 billion.
   Second on the list is Israel, which has $4 billion in
unrefinanced debt. An additional $4.5 billion in high-interest
military loans was recently refinanced under a program that offered
U.S. guarantees and yielded an immediate saving to Israel of about
$1.8 billion.
   Other top military debtors include Turkey, which owes $3.4
billion, a portion of which has been refinanced; Greece, $1.9
billion; and Pakistan, $1.3 billion. Further down the list is
Jordan, which could argue that economic hardship stemming from the
U.N. trade embargo with Iraq could justify forgiving its nearly
$400 million in military debt.
   And there is no reason the list will stop at those who owe the
United States for past weapons purchases. Poland's debt is
primarily for food purchases from the United States, and Obey has
included in the emerging 1991 foreign aid bill a provision that
would let Bush forgive most of it.
   Carrying the loans on the books means some countries take the
aid they receive from the United States, intended to help build
their economies, and in effect sign the checks back over to the
Treasury in repayment of their debts.
   Egypt, for example, owes principal and interest totalling more
than $1 billion this year, more than the $815 million in economic
aid it got from the United States. The situation, says Obey, is an
``absurdity.''

<HEAD>Cheney: Saudi Defense No Free Lunch for U.S. Allies</HEAD>

   The U.S. allies who depend on Saudi Arabian
oil must realize that sending more than 100,000 U.S. military men
and women to the Persian Gulf ``is no free lunch,'' Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney says.
   ``We need to have some of our friends step up to the counter and
contribute more than some of them have indicated that they are
prepared to contribute,'' Cheney said Thursday.
   The Pentagon chief's blunt remarks came as Secretary of State
James A. Baker III and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady continued
their global search for cash to help pay for Operation Desert
Shield.
   Cheney, in a speech to the Institute for Strategic Studies in
Hot Springs, Va., chided those nations whose economies benefit from
the guarantee of a free flow of oil, but haven't offered to help
foot the bill.
   ``There's no free lunch here,'' he said.
   Except for lauding the military contributions of Britain,
France, and the Arab nations who have come to Saudi Arabia's
defense, Cheney mentioned no nations by name.
   Key Arab allies are planning to boost their forces, The
Washington Post reported in today's editions.
   The newspaper, quoting unidentified officials in Saudi Arabia
and Washington, said Egypt had agreed to expand its force of 2,000
soldiers to 30,000 and Syria had separately agreed to boost its
3,200-man contingent by 20,000.
   Cheney cited ``ample opportunities'' to help _ such as sending
troops, aiding the transportation of troops or refugees, or even
offering economic assistance to nations such as Jordan or Turkey
that have been economically strapped by the U.N. trade embargo
against Iraq.
   In his first public comment about the numbers involved in the
U.S. buildup, Cheney said there are more than 100,000 U.S. armed
forces in the Persian Gulf region.
   But is ``too soon as yet'' to halt the flow of troops and
weaponry, he added.
   Since U.S. forces were dispatched to Saudi Arabia and gulf
waters after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, Pentagon
officials have been publicly silent about the exact number of
forces or weaponry.
   However, it had been widely reported that some 60,000 ground
troops and airmen had reached Saudi soil, while tens of thousands
of sailors were on the dozens of U.S. Navy ships in the Persian
Gulf and the Red Sea.
   ``The worst sin of all would be for us to deploy forces out
there sufficient enough to get into trouble, but not strong enough
to deal with any eventuality that may arise,'' Cheney said.
   He said the U.S. deployment of ground troops had reached a
``significant'' size, since the heavy tanks of the Army's 24th
Infantry Division (Mechanized) and two Marine expeditionary
brigades had joined elements of the 82nd and the 101st Airborne
divisions.
   Members of the 1st Cavalry Division from Fort Hood, Texas, were
on their way as well, Cheney said.

   The leader of the nation's largest black
church says racism in America is worse now than it was during the
civil rights struggles of the 1950s and '60s.
   Former President Reagan and his appointments to the Supreme
Court are a large part of the problem, the Rev. T.J. Jemison said
Thursday at the 110th annual meeting of the National Baptist
Convention U.S.A. Inc.
   ``He (Reagan) will be remembered not because he didn't have a
memory, but he will be remembered because he gave respectability to
racism,'' he said.
   Jemison, who led one of the first successful boycotts of
segregated busing in Baton Rouge, La., in 1953, said race relations
stand at a criticial point in the nation's history.
   He said he thought the battle to condemn racism had been won
during the civil rights struggle, but ``it's worse now than it's
ever been.''
   In his presidential address, Jemison also called for a
negotiated settlement to the crisis in the Persian Gulf.
   He said that while he supported President Bush's decison to send
troops to the Middle East, ``this convention does not condone war
that takes the lives of our best young men and women, black and
white, because of oil.''
   The convention was expected to act today on a resolution on the
gulf crisis.
   With 7.8 million members, the Baptist convention is not only the
nation's largest black church body, but claims to be the largest
black organization in the world.
   In the highly hierarchical convention, the presidential address
offers a blueprint of where the denomination stands on social
issues.
   The Baptist leader singled out Reagan's appointments to the
Supreme Court for criticism, saying blacks will feel the impact of
his conservative movement for three decades.
   ``They call themselves strict constructionists, but I call them
strict segregationists,'' Jemison said.
   Addressing internal church issues, Jemison appealed to National
Baptists to support their own institutions, including the $10
million World Baptist Center. The center has caused some grumbling
about whether the denomination is more concerned with architectural
monuments than the social needs of black Americans.
   Jemison said there must be fewer pastors and churches dropping
only $100 in the convention's bucket.
   ``Isn't that a disgrace,'' Jemison said as he urged the 11,000
delegates to give more to both church programs and the world center
in Nashville, the first headquarters building for the denomination.
   But the emphasis on fund-raising for the center rankled some
delegates.
   Delegate Al Lipscomb of Dallas said in an interview Thursday the
center is a ``Tower of Babel'' that reflects the denomination's
lack of a social agenda.
   ``This really saddens me to see $10 million in the glorification
of a center versus all the nation crying out for help,'' Lipscomb
said.

   Members of Congress
bringing words of support to U.S. troops in the Saudi desert are
seeking more support from America's allies for the military action.
   Several members of the 11-man delegation urged allies Thursday
to send troops to join the Americans on Saudi soil and to help pay
the costs of the continuing American buildup.
   The delegation's visit was to continue today, with stops at
several other units before an evening flight to Jiddah for a
meeting with Saudi King Fahd.
   Saudi Arabia on Thursday pledged billions to underwrite U.S.
military operations in the Arabian desert, but European allies have
yet to field ground troops in the region.
   ``I'm dissatisfied with the lack of burden-sharing generally so
far,'' Rep. Les Aucoin, D-Ore., said Thursday during a visit with
the 82nd Airborne Division's 1st Brigade in the Saudi desert. ``My
constituents are looking for good-faith efforts on the part of our
allies.''
   Echoing that theme was Rep. Bill Hefner, D-N.C., who said he
expected more European allies to support the Saudi defense effort
because they ``depend far more on energy supplies from this area
than we do.''
   For the troops, the delegation brought promises that Congress
and the American people support the deployment.
   ``You have averted a war to this point,'' Rep. John Murtha,
D-Pa., chairman of the House Defense Appropriations subcommittee
told the paratroopers. ``I don't know if you will down the road but
you have to this point.''
   Several lawmakers said they came away from military briefings
with the impression Iraq's Saddam Hussein would be foolish to
attack Saudi Arabia because of the growing American force.
   ``I think that every day that goes by the risk of a shooting war
is less and less,'' Hefner said.
   Murtha concurred but added the caution:
   ``Anytime you have a potential enemy as fanatical as (Saddam)
Hussein is, you have to believe there could be a war,'' he said.
``But if he has any professional ability at all, he will see that
he will pay a high price.''
   Murtha said he envisioned a long U.S. military presence in the
region if Saddam stays in power as part of any resolution of the
current crisis.
   ``We would have to have a substantial presence in the Middle
East,'' Murtha said.
   He said it was unclear whether U.S. forces would be invited to
remain on Saudi soil, but added: ``I don't think the Saudis will
want us to leave any time in the near future.''
   For now, he said, the U.S. deployment was ``open-ended'' and has
the support of Congress and the American people.
   Several members of the delegation said the Middle East crisis
would force a rethinking of American defense policy to respond to
the first major military challenge of the post-Cold War era.
   They said expensive missile systems are likely to face cuts and
more will be spent on faster sealift and air transport capacity.
Manpower cuts also will be deferred, the lawmakers said.
   ``We're going to have to shift some priorities,'' said Hefner.

<HEAD>Military Teachings Focus on Lessons of Vietnam</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military's command schools are preparing
officers for conflicts such as the Persian Gulf crisis by teaching
the hard lessons once learned in Vietnam.
   Military educators told a congressional panel on Thursday that
from the Marine Corps classrooms in Quantico, Va., to the Air
Force's school in Maxwell Field, Ala., officers are taught that the
focus is no longer on a superpower showdown.
   ``It's not the world environment in which we live,'' Brig. Gen.
John Miller, deputy commandant of the U.S. Army Command and General
Staff College, told the House Armed Services subcommittee on
professional military education.
   It was an obvious acknowledgment of the U.S. invasion of Panama
in December and the current massing of troops in Saudi Arabia to
thwart Iraqi aggression.
   Students also are exposed to the painful lessons from the
Vietnam War and the rancorous issues that emerged from that
conflict, including the massacre at My Lai, inflated body counts
and unauthorized bombings.
   ``The good, the bad and the ugly,'' said Brig. Gen. Phillip J.
Ford, commandant of the Air Command and Staff College.
   Miller said many of the instructors are Vietnam War veterans who
saw battles from the company to the command level.
   ``We bring to our task of educating tomorrow's leaders the
realization that we did not fully understand the essential linkages
between a clear statement of national objectives, the development
of a national strategy, a military strategy and an operational
campaign level,'' Miller said.
   ``We have no intention of watching that happen again,'' he said.
   Capt. Elizabeth Wylie, dean of academics at the Naval War
College in Rhode Island, said the goal was ``not to have a school
solution but a lively discussion.''
   During the past academic year, a policy and strategy symposium
at the Marine Corps facility included presentations from Gen.
William Westmoreland, the former U.S. commander during the Vietnam
War, and Roger Hilsman, a top official in the Kennedy
administration who argued against U.S. involvement in Vietnam.
   Among the titles on the reading list for Marine Corps officers
are ``A Bright, Shining Lie,'' Neil Sheehan's account of the life
of John Paul Vann, an acclaimed military leader in Vietnam, and
Stanley Karnow's best-seller, ``Vietnam: A History.''
   The books detail both the United States' successes and failures
in Southeast Asia.
   ``We're obligated to provide varying points of view. It's left
for students to draw personal lessons,'' said Col. David A. Vetter,
director of the Marine Corps Command and Staff College.
   Military educators noted that most of their students have never
been in a war and from a historic perspective, the most recent
lengthy conflict they recall is the Vietnam War.
   The hearing, chaired by Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., was prompted by
his conversations with military officials in which he learned that
the Indian wars weren't being taught to students at Fort
Leavenworth.
   Skelton said he was pleased to hear that the service colleges
were taking ``low- and mid-intensity conflicts seriously'' as well
as addressing the thorny issues from the Vietnam War.
   However, he expressed dismay that none of the schools had
invited retired Col. David Hackworth to speak. The highly decorated
soldier recently wrote a book harshly critical of the U.S. role in
Vietnam.

   If war erupts in the Persian
Gulf, a U.S. Marine general says American air power could quickly
smash Iraq's defenses.
   Maj. Gen. Royal N. Moore Jr. said Thursday that the stronger,
technologically superior U.S. and Arab forces arrayed in Saudi
Arabia along the border with Iraq would ultimately triumph over an
offensive by Saddam Hussein's army.
   ``We want about three to five minutes, and we're going to give
them the most violent three to five minutes they've ever seen,''
said Moore, speaking to reporters at a display of Marine Corps
aircraft. ``That's all we want.''
   Earlier Thursday, Saudi Arabia's defense minister, Prince
Sultan, was quoted as warning Iraq that if Saddam carried out his
threat to use chemical weapons, Saudis would respond with
``lethal'' Chinese-made CSS-2 ballistic missiles that can hit
anywhere in Iraq.
   Although President Bush said Aug. 5 that Iraq's armed takeover
of Kuwait Aug. 2 ``will not stand,'' senior U.S. officers have
carefully avoided suggesting that any offensive is planned.
   They stress that U.S. forces are in Saudi Arabia only to protect
it from further aggression.
   But should war break out, Moore said his strategy would be to
immediately gain air superiority by destroying Iraq's anti-aircraft
guns, missile batteries and air force ``within hours.''
   Iraqis' air defenses ``are lined up fairly heavy on the coast,''
he conceded.
   But, said Moore, ``There's always a back door. You can't defend
everything.'' Thus, he said, the multinational force would aim for
Iraq's vulnerable points.
   U.S. and allied air strength in the region, including
carrier-based aircraft and other superior U.S. and British
artillery, is well in excess of 700. Iraq has an estimated 500-plus
combat aircraft.
   Moore described a classic operation in which Marine air strikes,
Naval gunfire and artillery would ``soften up'' a target.
   Assault troops would then move in by helicopter, go ``around it
or over it'' or ``come in with the amphibious landing,'' deploying
assault troops from seaborne transports.
   ``The country and the area of operations are so small that it'll
be easy for me to cover ... any amphibious landing that we desire
to make,'' he said.
   But Moore, who commands the 3rd Marine Air Wing at El Toro,
Calif., conceded that the struggle for air supremacy probably would
cause casualties on the U.S. side.
   ``I'm not going to ever predict that it's going to be a
cakewalk,'' Moore said. ``If we do it right, the casualties will be
light, we hope.''
   He said that even if the U.S. forces seized control of the
skies, the final struggle likely would be on the ground.
   ``I'm not saying that all that air's going to win it,'' said
Moore. ``Air can't do everything. It's the tank-on-tank that
probably cleans it all up.''
   Moore declined to say whether the allied forces were strong
enough yet to seize Kuwait back from the Iraqis.
   But he said that ``if the force level continues, there will be a
period in time that we have enough combat power on the ground to do
that.''
   Moore said ``trolling'' probes by U.S. reconnaissance planes had
revealed a formidable array of Iraqi anti-aircraft defenses along
the coast to the north of the troops' location.
   The Iraqis have set their Soviet-made SA-2 and SA-3 missiles to
track U.S. aircraft at 80-100 miles off the coast. The SA-2s have a
range of about 11 miles and the SA-3s eight miles.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III issued a
comprehensive statement on the Persian Gulf crisis the other day
that barely mentioned American hostages in Kuwait and Iraq.
   In a curious way, Baker was speaking volumes about Bush
administration policy on the issue: American hostages are not going
to be an obsession of this administration, in contrast with its
predecessors.
   Hostage crises produced the darkest hours for the last two
presidents. Of Ronald Reagan's eight years in office, none was more
trying than the late 1986-87 period when his efforts to obtain the
release of the American hostages in Lebanon degenerated into the
Iran-Contra affair.
   President Bush and Baker, both top lieutenants of Reagan, had
bird's eye views of the political costs of the blunders Reagan
committed in his eagerness to get the hostages home.
   And memories are still fresh of how President Carter was
virtually chained to the White House for months on end in 1979-80,
trying to devise a strategy for liberating the 52 American hostages
in Iran. In his re-election bid, Carter carried six states.
   Some might say the current administration is being cold-hearted
in not giving the Americans in Kuwait and Iraq its highest
priority. After all, there are about 50 times more Americans held
on Saddam Hussein's turf than there were in Tehran a decade ago.
   But that ignores the efforts the administration has made on
behalf of the hostages, many of which have received little
attention. The U.S. Embassy in Iraq makes daily appeals to the
Iraqi Foreign Ministry for their release. The main reason the
American Embassy in Kuwait remains open _ under appalling
conditions _ in defiance of Iraqi orders is so that U.S. diplomats
there can try to help the 2,200 or so Americans trapped in Kuwait.
   There are also tales of American diplomats loitering sometimes
for days on end at the Iraqi border with Turkey, Jordan or Saudi
Arabia, awaiting the possibility that a stray American in need of
assistance might turn up. When an American appeared at the Saudi
border the other day, she was received by a lonesome U.S. diplomat
who had been staked out there for eight days.
   But there is a distinct
let's-do-it-differently-from-Carter-and-Reagan image being
projected by the administration concerning this hostage crisis.
   Bush refuses to allow the dust-up to imprison him in the White
House; he spent much of August frolicking at his Maine vacation
retreat. Baker has spent part of the crisis at his Wyoming ranch,
receiving from a London newspaper the sobriquet ``the invisible
man.''
   The families of some hostages object to what they regard as the
cavalier attitude of Bush and Baker toward the captives.
   ``If it was the president's son, he would not go on vacation,''
said Florence Culbertson, wife of a former hostage who returned to
his Texas home this week.
   The administration is operating under the assumption that the
best way to obtain freedom for the hostages is to devalue them,
make their captors believe they will gain nothing by continuing to
hold them.
   Bush said last week he will not be deterred from taking military
action by Iraqi threats to the hostages. Baker spoke in a similar
vein this week to the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
   ``We stand at a critical juncture in our history,'' Baker said,
calling the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait ``one of the defining moments
of a new era.''
   Decisive action, he said, is required to confront a ``dictator
who acting alone and unchallenged could strangle the global
economic order, determining by fiat whether we all enter a
recession or even the darkness of a depression.''
   Baker's between the lines message is that this worst-case
scenario could come about if the fate of the hostages _ and not
national security interests _ becomes the issue that drives U.S.
policy.

   Three leftist radicals could receive 15-year
sentences under a deal with prosecutors in which they agreed to
admit participating in a conspiracy to bomb the U.S. Capitol and
seven other locations.
   Marilyn J. Buck, Linda S. Evans and Laura J. Whitehorn are
scheduled to appear today in U.S. District Court to plead guilty to
participating in a two-year conspiracy of ``armed propaganda'' to
detonate bombs in government buildings and private offices,
according to court documents.
   Prosecutors have agreed to drop charges against three
co-defendants, according to court papers.
   The three women also agreed to plead guilty to setting of a bomb
that blew a hole in a wall outside the U.S. Senate chamber late
Nov. 7, 1983.
   The conspiracy count carries a five-year prison term while the
charge of causing malicious damage to the Capitol carries a maximum
10-year term.
   The blast, which occurred after Congress had recessed for the
night, damaged five paintings and blew the door off its hinges
outside the office of Democratic leader Robert Byrd.
   None of the bombings in New York and Washington between 1983 and
1985 caused any injuries.
   The group, calling itself the Armed Resistance Unit, the
Revolutionary Fighting Group or the Red Guerrilla Resistance,
claimed responsibility for the bombings in communiques to news
organizations.
   The underground organization is linked to a series of other
crimes, including the $1.6 million armed holdup of an armored car
near Nyack, N.Y., in 1981 in which two policemen and a guard were
killed.
   Buck, 42, is serving a 50-year prison sentence for participating
in the armed holdup and four others. She was also convicted of
racketeering for helping convicted murderer Joanne Chesimard escape
from a New Jersey state prison in 1979.
   Evans, 43, is already serving a 40-year prison term for
illegally purchasing firearms.
   Whitehorn, 45, the only defendant not already serving another
prison term, could face an additional five-year sentence if she
pleads guilty to fraud in connection with possession of fake
identification documents.
   The plea agreement signed by the defendants and prosecutors said
the government will dismiss charges against Timothy Blunk, Susan
Rosenberg and Alan Berkman.
   Attorneys familiar with the case said that a Supreme Court
ruling on the issue of double jeopardy that was issued in May
influenced the government's decision to drop the case against
Blunk, Rosenberg and Berkman.
   Another factor was the lengthy sentences being served by all but
one of the six defendants, said the attorneys, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Blunk, 33, and Rosenberg, 34, are serving 58-year sentences for
possessing a 600-pound arsenal of dynamite, blasting caps, and
other explosives. Berkman, a physician, is serving a 10-year
sentence for possession of explosives, firearms and fake
identification cards.

   The financial performance of banks in the
Midwest, South and West showed improvement in the second quarter,
while loan problems continued to grow in the Northeast and
Southeast, government figures show.
   Nationwide, commercial banks earned $5.3 billion from April
through June of this year, down 24 percent from the same period in
1989, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. reported Thursday.
   The FDIC said banks in the Northeast dragged down profits for
the entire industry, which had earned a record $7 billion in the
second quarter of 1989.
   ``It's not great, but it's not terrible,'' said Robert Litan, a
senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington research
group. ``It's continued sogginess, basically.''
   At a news conference, FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said the
latest banking results are ``very much a mixed bag.'' Banks in the
West appear strong, while ``New England is having ... a real
recession,'' he said.
   Seidman conceded that the outlook for banks and the economy has
been complicated by the Persian Gulf crisis and the resulting
increase in oil prices.
   Higher oil prices should help Texas and the Southwest, but that
``certainly is not going to be helpful to New England,'' he said.
   ``They're making a bad situation worse for a lot of banks that
already had problems,'' Litan said, noting that the inflationary
effect of rising oil prices tends to make banks more cautious about
making new loans.
   Banks in the Northeast had a total net income of $1.026 billion
in the second quarter, down a steep 62.9 percent from the same
period last year.
   Real estate values have fallen sharply in the region. Nearly all
of the banking industry's $2 billion increase in provisions against
future loan losses was accounted for by banks in the Northeast,
where those provisions rose by $1.9 billion.
   That was more than twice the amount set aside for future losses
by Northeast banks in the second quarter of 1989, the FDIC said.
   ``The real estate problems of the Northeast have spread to the
mid-Atlantic states, and signs of real estate weakness have
appeared in several Southeastern states,'' the agency said.
   Banks in Maryland, Georgia and the District of Columbia showed a
sharp increase in delinquent real estate loans during the quarter,
the FDIC said. Banks in 22 other states had some rise in the
delinquency rate of those loans.
   Six states registered a strong decline in delinquent real estate
loans: Utah, Illinois, Wyoming, Kansas, Montana and North Dakota.
Eighteen others showed some decrease.
   Most of the growth in real estate loans overall came from banks
in the West, where they increased 7.25 percent during the second
quarter. Home mortgages in California banks _ which jumped more
than $5 billion, or 11 percent _ accounted for most of the growth
in real estate loans in the West.
   Construction loans by Western banks rose by almost $1 billion
during the period, including $881 million in California, while they
decreased overall for the industry.
   Despite the progress in some regions, ``the quality of the
banking industry's real estate loans is continuing to decline,''
the FDIC said. Nationwide, delinquent real estate loans increased
by $3.2 billion in the second quarter, a rise of 13 percent from a
year earlier.
   Most of the latest increase, $3.05 billion, came from banks in
the Northeast.
   Analysts have said it would take a downturn at only a few large
commercial banks to cause trouble for the deposit insurance fund,
which posted losses in 1988 and 1989, even if most of the industry
is healthy.
   Separately, the Office of Thrift Supervision reported last week
that the financial conditions of more than 200 savings and loans
have worsened since the agency made its last report in May. At
least 246 S&amp;Ls are expected to fail and are likely candidates for
government takeover, the office said.

<HEAD>Women Should Stand Up for Themselves, Griffiths Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women must become more aggressive and
outspoken in the face of indifference to their struggle for
equality, says Lt. Gov. Martha Griffiths, who complained loudly
about being pushed off the Democratic ticket in Michigan.
   ``Women are too modest and too quiet,'' Griffiths told the
National Press Club. ``It's partly their own fault that they don't
get promoted. They should be indispensable. They should be so good
at the job that you can't get anybody else.''
   The former state legislator and congresswoman sponsored the
Equal Rights Amendment and an amendment to the 1964 Civil Rights
Act that outlawed discrimination on the basis of sex as well as
race.
   Her appearance came in the wake of Gov. James Blanchard's
decision last month against retaining Griffiths as his running mate
in his campaign for a third term.
   Blanchard, a Democrat, said he needed someone who could assume
his job at a moment's notice. He said Griffiths, 78, had declined
to release her medical records.
   She reacted bitterly to the decision but said Thursday she would
support Blanchard's re-election because ``he has been a good
governor and I know the other guy,'' a reference to GOP nominee
John Engler.

   An editor at the Washington Afro-American

to profile a mayoral candidate because he is white.
   Robyn Denise Yourse, who is black, said Thursday she submitted
her resignation to publisher Frances Murphy after Murphy refused to
include a story on City Council Chairman David Clarke in a 36-page
issue of the paper.
   ``I felt that the reasons given for yanking the profile were
racially biased,'' said Yourse. ``It was a decision in all good
conscience I could not agree with.''
   Yourse declined to elaborate on her discussion with the

   Murphy denied that Clarke was excluded because of his race,
claiming that other candidates who did not receive the paper's

   Voters
</TEXT>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Big Green and alcohol tax ballot
initiatives are popular with California voters, though only a
minority had heard of the environmental measure, a poll shows.
   Proposition 134, the nickel-a-drink alcohol tax measure, would
raise funds for alcohol and drug abuse programs, emergency medical
care and other programs. It led 69 percent to 24 percent, according
to the statewide California Poll of 468 people conducted between
Aug. 17-27.
   Proposition 128, the environmental protection measure known as
the Big Green, trailed among the voters who had heard of it before
they were given the survey, with 12 percent supporting and 16
percent against. Once a summary of the measure was read to all
those polled, the measure led 58 percent to 26 percent.
   The measure would phase out pesticides linked to cancer, ban oil
drilling in state waters, curb ocean pollution, mandate big cuts in
``greenhouse'' gases and raise $200 million to save old-growth
trees. It also would create the elected position of environmental
advocate to prosecute violators.
   Pollster Mervin Field said Wednesday that heavy advertising
campaigns aimed at both measures may narrow the gap by the time the
initiatives are voted on in November. The margin of error in the
poll was 4.8 percent.

   President Bush and his wife Barbara will fly
to the superpower summit in Helsinki tonight aboard the new Air
Force One jumbo jet that a delighted president calls ``marvelous in
every way.''
   Bush took his maiden flight Thursday in the gleaming, regally
appointed Boeing 747 that replaced an 18-year-old Boeing 707 that
had carried every president since Richard Nixon.
   On cross-country hops to political rallies in Topeka, Kan., and
Tallahassee, Fla., Bush pronounced himself well pleased with the
whale-shaped aircraft, one of two jumbos that Congress and
President Reagan commissioned in 1986 at a cost of more than a
quarter-billion dollars.
   It can fly 7,140 miles without refueling _ 1,400 miles farther
than the old Air Force One _ and could even be refueled aloft in a
pinch.
   ``Have plane, will travel,'' the peripatetic president quipped
when reporters jokingly asked if he planned any day trips to the
Persian Gulf to visit U.S. troops.
   ``It's marvelous in every way _ the latest in technology and
certainly very, very comfortable,'' Bush said after getting his
first look inside the jet. It is painted in the same striking
colors of white, royal blue and robin's egg blue with a gold stripe
that John F. Kennedy chose for the first presidential jet 28 years
ago.
   Kennedy's plane until now has still been used as the backup to
the regular Air Force One. When a second jumbo jet is delivered by
next June, both the 707s will be relegated to ferrying lesser
government VIPs.
   The creature comforts range from a shower-equipped presidential
lavatory to an airborne office with a large wooden desk to a fully
decked conference room that could accommodate more than half the
Cabinet.
   Bush and his wife will share a cabin in the nose of the plane
decorated in soothing wood tones, with his-and-hers leather
armchairs and twin sofas that fold out into twin beds. An
upholstered wall mural depicts a rustic sunset in soft hues.
   There's even a medical room where the White House physician
could perform emergency surgery atop a stretcher that latches onto
a reclining chair.
   There are televisions galore, 85 telephones, computers, memory
typewriters, facsimile machines, a paper shredder, two galleys with
ovens and microwaves and enough freezer space to feed almost 100
people for a week.
   The new plane boasts separate cabins for guests, Bush's senior
staff and other aides as well as for Secret Service agents and
media representatives.
   The jumbo seats 70 passengers and 23 crew members, half again as
many as the old plane. It can carry a media pool of 13 members, two
more than before.
   The passengers on the maiden flight had nine movies to choose
from, viewed on overhead televisions with the sound over stereo
headsets. Thursday's offerings included ``Indiana Jones and the
Last Crusade'' and ``Young Einstein.''
   Veteran flight attendant Becky Schulz said it will be more work
running around the larger plane, but ``a lot less stress.''
   ``You won't be stepping over people's feet all the time,'' she
said.

<HEAD>FDA Targets 6 Bran Claims for Reduced Cholesterol</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration is targeting
six companies for its first action to enforce a policy barring food
makers from labeling their products with cholesterol-lowering
claims.
   In letters to the six released Thursday, the agency said the
claims for bran products are not backed by scientific evidence and
must be removed from the product labels.
   The food-labeling policy, proposed last February but being
enforced as an interim rule until one is formally adopted, allows
companies to make only limited health claims about their products.
   Linking bran's dietary fiber to lower cholesterol is not among
the permitted claims. But an official of one of the companies
warned says the claim is scientifically legitimate.
   ``We feel the excellent studies that have been done more than
qualify these products'' to make cholesterol-lowering claims, said
Curt Rocca, chairman of Pacific Rice Products of Woodland, Calif.
   Officials of his company plan to discuss the studies with the
FDA in hopes of persuading the agency to allow claims that eating
``Vita Fiber Rice Bran'' daily can reduce cholesterol levels in the
blood.
   In its letter to Pacific Rice, the FDA said the claims were
``false and misleading in that they are not supported by ... the
1988 Surgeon General's Report on Nutrition and Health and the 1989
National Academy of Sciences Report on Diet and Health.''
   Similar warning letters were sent to Ralston Purina Co. of St.
Louis for ``Oat Chex'' cereal and Continental Baking Co. of St.
Louis for ``Oatmeal Goodness Bread Wheat Oatmeal.''
   Letters also went to J &amp; J Snack Foods Corp. of Vernon, Calif.,
for ``Toasted Oat Bran Shake;'' Health Valley Foods Inc. of
Irwindale, Calif., for ``Oat Bran Fruit Jumbo Cookies;'' and Select
Origins Inc. of Yaphank, N.Y., for ``Rice Bran Oil.''
   In its letter to Ralston Purina, the FDA said labeling of ``Oat
Chex'' was ``false and misleading'' because the claims ``suggest
that a serving of the product provides a nutritionally significant
amount of fiber, and particularly soluble fiber, which is contrary
to fact.''
   Patrick Farrell, spokesman for Ralston and Continental Baking, a
Ralston subsidiary, said, ``It's our belief that all of our
products comply with regulations concerning label requirements.''
   The companies have 10 days to respond to the FDA's warning.
   The FDA's draft policy allows specific health messages on
products if they fall within a narrow range of claims regarding
relationships between diet and health benefits that are outlined in
the recent reports by the U.S. surgeon general and the National
Academy of Sciences.
   Those areas have been limited to calcium and osteoporosis,
sodium and hypertension, fats and cardiovascular disease, fats and
cancer, dietary fiber and cancer, and fiber and cardiovascular
disease.
   The FDA had said that if other links between diet and health are
scientifically shown, they could be added to the list.
   Because there have been conflicting scientific reports as to
whether dietary fiber reduces cholesterol, the FDA is not allowing
that claim to be made on food products.
   The FDA told the companies that if corrective action is not
taken, it could seek court action to remove the products from
stores.

<HEAD>FTC Wants To Make More College Football Games Available on
Television</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In some cities, a college football fan might
have access to a dozen televised games on a Saturday. The Federal
Trade Commission doesn't think that's enough.
   Asserting that television viewers aren't getting a full
selection of games because of restraints on competition, the FTC
said Thursday it will try to change the system.
   The College Football Association and Capital Cities, which owns
ABC and ESPN, are unhappy about it and are set to fight the FTC's
administrative complaint.
   ``We want to have the marketplace ... determine what games are
shown and when,'' said Kevin Arquit, director of the FTC Bureau of
Competition.
   ``We think the system is operating to the benefit of
consumers,'' said Lewis Engman, the CFA's lawyer and former FTC
chairman. ``CFA is not a cartel. We are not interested in
restricting output. We are trying to get more and more games on
TV.''
   The CFA was created as a bargaining agent for the major football
schools and began marketing games in 1984, after the U.S. Supreme
Court ruled that the NCAA violated antitrust law by selling
national TV contracts for the games.
   But Arquit said the current system, with the CFA negotiating a
network contract for its 64 member schools, is not in the best
interests of consumers, schools or television networks.
   He argued that the Supreme Court ruled that restrictions aren't
necessary and the same reasoning holds for the CFA practices. But
Engman said the circumstances are different because the NCAA would
not let individual schools sell television rights to their games
and the CFA does.
   ``That's a far cry from the present situation,'' Engman said.
``Every (CFA) member school has the right to sell every one of its
games, if it wishes.''
   Notre Dame, for instance, sold rights to its home games,
beginning in 1991, to NBC, eliminating those games from the CFA-ABC
package that is to start next season.
   Engman called the proceeding ``a royal waste of taxpayer's
money. I'm not aware of anyone complaining that there's not enough
football on television.'' He said any CFA member can sell
television rights to its games to local, cable or syndicated
stations.
   But schools can't sell to national networks or, on cable, to
ESPN, which is 80 percent owned by Capital Cities and with which
the CFA also has an exclusive deal. Stations that purchase games on
their own may not show them late Saturday afternoon when the
network is showing the game to which it has exclusive rights.
   Arquit said the FTC also is concerned about contractual limits
on the number of times certain schools can appear on television.
   An administrative law judge will rule on the allegations of
anti-competitive practices after a hearing Nov. 13. The decision
can be appealed to the five FTC commissioners and ultimately to the
U.S. Court of Appeals.
   This year's contracts will not be affected.
   If the FTC charges are upheld, Arquit said, existing contracts
could be rescinded and future anti-competitive contracts would be
barred. Asked if each school would have to negotiate TV contracts
on its own in that case, Arquit said he didn't know.
   In a statement, ABC Sports said the arrangement with CFA is
``entirely lawful and in the public interest. The agreement is
designed to offer a broad selection of college football games to
the widest possible audience. The number and quality of games
available to viewers will benefit viewers, advertisers and college
football.''
   Right now, ABC has a contract with the Big Ten and Pacific-10,
which are not part of the CFA. The CFA's $64-million, four-year
contract with CBS expires after this season and ABC has a
five-year, $210 million deal with the organization.
   Arquit said the FTC's investigation began two years ago but
refused to say what triggered it. Usually such probes are spurred
by a consumer complaint or a congressional inquiry. Engman said no
CFA member had complained and said he did not believe any networks
had approached the FTC.

<TEXT>
   The dollar closed sharply lower against the
Japanese yen on Friday, while prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
rose slightly.
   The dollar closed at 140.25 yen, down 1.40 yen from Thursday's
close of 141.65 yen. The low for the day's trading was 140.00 and
the high was 141.00. It was the lowest closing value for the dollar
since 141.55 yen on Oct. 25, 1989.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues recovered to
close at 23,962.07, up 150.16 points, or 0.63 percent. Estimated
volume of trading for first-section shares was 440 million shares.
   In bond dealings, the yield of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds finished the day almost even with
Thursday's level, closing at 8.250 percent, up slightly from
Thursday's close of 8.245 percent. The price stood at 82.46 points,
down from 82.48.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's low opening followed its
overnight downswing in New York over speculation that U.S. monetary
authorities might push interest rates lower.
   But short-covering pulled the dollar back from the brink of the
psychological barrier of 140 yen to the dollar, said Tadashi
Sazaki, assistant general manager of the foreign exchange and
international treasury division of the Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank.
   Analysts said the market's attention is focused on the U.S.
Labor Department's release Friday of unemployment statistics for
August on the assumption that the Federal Reserve Board, the
nation's central bank, will respond by pushing interest rates lower
to give the economy a boost.
   Kan Sugita, a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, said the early
dollar trading was brisk in both buying and selling. ``But I don't
think the dollar will soon move below the 140-yen level'' before
the release of the unemployment data, Sugita said.
   The stock market started slowly with mixed small-lot buying and
selling in a favorable reaction to the yen's appreciation against
the dollar, though some investors remained cautious against rising
oil prices and an overnight decline on Wall Street, dealers said.
   ``Every investor is very, very negative,'' said Hidetada Yoshida
of Kidder Peabody. Traders are worried about what kind of a deal
might be cut at the weekend summit of President Bush and Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev. ``If the ceremony fails to get agreement,
the market will be disappointed,'' he said.
   Arbitrage trading and the rapid fall on the bond market,
heralding higher interest rates, also drove the market down, he
said.

<TEXT>
   A Utah tourist slain while defending his mother
against subway robbers is memorialized with graffiti in a
schoolyard where the teen-ager accused of stabbing him once taught
youngsters handball.
   The name Brian Watkins, spray-painted in bright red, orange,
purple and blue, towers over the courtyard behind Junior High
School 189 in the city's Queens borough.
   ``I gave that tribute to him,'' said Papo Love. ``I feel sorry
for him because he lost his life for defending his mom.''
   Love and other youths who knew murder suspect Yull Gary Morales,
19, of Queens, gathered by the decorated wall Thursday and talked
about the penalty Morales should face if convicted of second-degree
murder.
   Police say Morales alleged that Watkins ``ran into'' his knife
Sunday night in a Manhattan subway station. After his father was
robbed of $200 and his mother was knocked to the ground, Watkins,
22, fought back and was stabbed.
   Morales, known as ``Rocstar'' on the street, and seven other
youths were charged Monday with killing Watkins as they tried to
raise money to go dancing.
   Next to Love's tribute to Watkins, someone spray painted
``Rocstar, be cool man.'' Also written was ``Rest in peace,'' ``May
God be with you'' and a peace symbol.
   The Watkins family came to New York from Provo for the U.S. Open
tennis tournament, held in the same area of Flushing, Queens, where
members of the street gang Morales co-founded, FTS, often hang out.
   The youths charged in the killing all were members of FTS, a
posse _ a menacing gang or a group of friendly youths who like to
dance and scrawl graffiti, depending on who describes them. Some
locals said FTS was an obscene acronym; others said it stands for
``Flushing Top Society.''
   A member of another street group, The Sanford Boys, who refused
to identify himself, said of Morales: ``He's our friend. We don't
believe he did it intentionally, but he did it and he's wrong.''
   The graffiti tribute was praised by 10-year-old John Zambrano,
who said Morales used to teach him and his friends how to play
handball behind the school.
   ``He used to be a nice quiet kid,'' Zambrano said. ``He used to
write poetry to his girlfriend.''
   The ethnic mix of Flushing is evident the moment one walks into
Junior High School 189 and sees flags from 79 different nations in
the main corridor. Eight other flags have been stolen.
   The school's principal, Jay R. Littman, said more than 30
languages and dialects are spoken by the school's nearly 1,300
students.
   ``It's a pretty solid community,'' Littman said. ``Something we
work on very hard is to get the students to respect people's rights
to their property.''

<HEAD>Scientists Find Genes Underlying Heart Disease in Young Athletes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The discovery of two genes that cause dangerous
thickening of the heart should help doctors spot youngsters who
inherit the defect and risk death during strenuous exercise.
   The research, conducted at Harvard Medical School and published
today, reveals the precise genetic error that underlies familial
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the leading cause of sudden death
among young athletes.
   Loyola Marymount basketball star Hank Gathers, who collapsed and
died during a game in March, had cardiomyopathy, although doctors
are unsure whether it resulted from the newly discovered genetic
mixup.
   The research marks the first time scientists have pinpointed the
precise genes responsible for an inherited abnormality of the heart
itself.
   The scientists found that the condition is passed through
families when errors occur in two side-by-side genes that oversee
the production of an essential heart protein.
   Victims are prone to suffer heart failure or heart rhythm
problems that can lead to cardiac arrest.
   Cardiomyopathy causes thickening of the walls of the heart.
While familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is rare _ affecting
about three in 100,000 people _ other forms of the condition are
common side effects of a variety of diseases, including high blood
pressure.
   By untangling the precise cause of the inherited form of the
disease, experts also hope they will shed light on the mysterious
origins of the far more common varieties of cardiomyopathy, and
help scientists design treatments.
   ``It has significance far beyond this relatively rare disease,''
said Dr. Christine Seidman. ``We'll gain significant insights in
the secondary causes of hypertrophy (thickening), which is a very
common phenomenon.''
   Seidman is senior author of the research, which is being
published in the journal Cell.
   Parents with cardiomyopathy have a 50 percent chance of passing
it on to their children. The Harvard researchers studied two
families with the disorder and found that it was caused by genes
that make proteins called myosin heavy chain polypeptides, which
are essential for muscle contraction.
   Each gene contains about 30,000 bits of information. In one
family, the disease resulted from a mistake in just one of those
bits of code. In the other family, people with the disease
inherited an extra gene that was a hybrid of the two heart protein
genes.
   Seidman said defects in these genes are responsible for some,
but not all, inherited cases of the ailment. Other research
suggests that mixups in genes elsewhere in the body's genetic
library can also trigger the condition.
   Tracking down the genes that underlie common conditions has
become a highly competitive area of medical research. Just this
week, other teams announced the discovery of one faulty gene that
can cause some cases of arthritis and another that results in
Creutzfelt-Jakob disease, an illness marked by rapid mental
deterioration.
   Finding the genes that cause inherited cardiomyopathy has been a
goal of researchers at several labs in the United States and Canada
for several years.
   ``The work is extremely important,'' said Dr. Neal Epstein, who
had been working on the disease at the National Heart, Lung and
Blood Institute in Bethesda, Md.
   He noted that some people who carry one of the faulty genes show
no outward signs of their condition, even though they may suffer
its consequences. Knowing the precise genetic defect should enable
physicians to determine whether or not they are at risk.
   It also can help parents who are unsure whether more than one of
their children also have the disease.
   ``If you had a child die suddenly while running to catch a bus,
this can cause tremendous emotional strain,'' said Seidman. ``Do
you let your other children run or play sports?''

   The ousted Kuwaiti government joined
Saudi Arabia today in pledging to help the United States bear the
cost of the military buildup set up since Iraq invaded its country
more than a month ago.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III flew to this royal
mountain retreat to see Kuwait's exiled monarch, Jabir al-Sabah,
whose regime already has pledged to compensate Turkey for losses of
up to $2 billion from the shutdown of an Iraqi oil pipeline.
   Al-Sabah said his government would contribute to the cost of the
American military buildup in the Persian Gulf region ``in order to
restore my country to what it was before.''
   Speaking through an interpreter, the exiled Kuwaiti leader said,
``We will not spare any amount or any value. We will give whatever
is necessary.''
   The emir, asked when he would return to his homeland, said he
could not predict. Baker interjected, however, ``The sooner the
better.''
   Later today Baker goes to Abu Dhabi for a meeting with President
Zayid of the United Arab Emirates. U.S. warplanes are deployed in
the Persian Gulf country to shield that country from Iraqi attack
as well.
   ``We are facing the first real crisis of the post-Cold War
world,'' Baker told reporters as he left Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, with
a multibillion dollar commitment from the wealthy monarchy that is
hosting 60,000 U.S. military men and women.
   Senior State Department officials said they were confident all
the allied gulf countries would participate in what Baker calls a
``responsibility-sharing'' operation.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady is also seeking financial
support from South Korea and Tokyo, but has yet received no firm
commitments.
   Saudi Arabia promised several billion dollars Thursday toward
defraying the staggering cost of the U.S. forces protecting the
kingdom's oil fields from Iraqi aggression, U.S. and Saudi
officials announced.
   The commitment came in response to a direct appeal by Baker.
   ``There was a meeting of the minds,'' a senior Saudi official
told reporters after Baker met twice with Prince Saud, the foreign
minister, and, for two hours, with King Fahd.
   Clearly pleased U.S. officials said the Saudis would, at the
minimum, pick up all fuel, water and transportation costs for the
American troops now stationed in Saudi Arabia. Earlier this week,
Baker told Congress the U.S. presence, which also involves some
40,000 forces at sea, would cost about $6 billion by year's end.
   Both U.S. and Saudi officials declined to provide a specific
price tag for the commitment, but the senior Saudi diplomat said,
``The United States will not be disappointed in what Saudi Arabia
is willing to do.''
   Other Persian Gulf countries and Japan also are expected to
pitch in, providing assistance along with Saudi Arabia to poorer
Arab and other countries feeling the bite of the U.S.-led economic
boycott of Iraq.
   At a joint news conference today in Jiddah, both Baker and Saud
ruled out compromise with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   ``There is really nothing to compromise,'' Baker said of the
U.S. demand for Iraq to reverse its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and
to restore the Kuwaiti emir to power. Compromise is ``not the word
to use,'' he said.
   Still, Baker said, ``Our desire and wish is to find a peaceful
way'' out of the Persian Gulf crisis. ``We cannot rule out any
options.''
   However, he offered no prescription to accomplish that goal.
   Baker acknowledged ``there has been some small leakage in
imports to Iraq,'' but he said the U.S.-led embargo on exports was
holding firm.
   Baker attributed the breach to a dispute on whether the Aug. 6
embargo approved by the U.N. Security Council permits food and
medicine to get through to the Iraqis.
   Baker said a U.N. sanctions committee was weighing the issue.
But he said there should be no exemption for commercial food sales
to Iraq.
   Earlier, a senior U.S. official said the Saudis were reaping
what could be considered a windfall from expanded oil production
following a decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to partially make up for oil from Iraq and Kuwait.
   Since Iraq conquered Kuwait and the United Nations placed an
embargo on Iraqi and Kuwaiti petroleum, Saudi oil production has
been boosted an estimated 2 million barrels a day to about 7.7
million barrels, giving the Saudis nearly $100 million a day in
additional revenues.
   From the outset of the crisis, the Bush administration has shied
away from publicizing how much it seeks from its allies to offset
U.S. military defense costs and to assist other nations hard
pressed by honoring the boycott.
   Informed estimates of what the administration seeks run to about
$500 million a month to help finance the deployment of tens of
thousands of U.S. troops and the naval armada offshore and $4
billion over 12 months for nations suffering from the economic
blockade of Iraq.

   Irish pop singer Sinead O'Connor
breezed past American bombshell Madonna for top honors at the
seventh annual MTV Music Video Awards, in a ceremony marked by a
protest against censorship.
   The outspoken O'Connor took video of the year, best female video
and best postmodern video for her stark ``Nothing Compares 2 U''
during the three-hour ceremony broadcast live Thursday night.
   Madonna's ``Vogue'' video won for direction, cinematography and
editing. Madonna, dressed in an 18th century French costume
bursting at the bust, performed a racy version of the video during
the awards show.
   Ex-Eagle Don Henley beat Billy Idol and M.C. Hammer in the best
male video category for ``End of the Innocence.'' But Hammer's ``U
Can't Touch This'' won in rap and dance categories.
   O'Connor's closely cropped head as she sings ``Nothing Compares
2 U'' predominates the winning video. Even when she starts crying,
the camera angle doesn't change.
   O'Connor caused a flap last month when she threatened to walk
out on an audience of 9,000 at the Garden State Arts Center in New
Jersey if the state-owned amphitheater played the national anthem
before her show.
   ``I'd like to say I had a great respect for people of all
countries, including American people,'' she told the sellout MTV
crowd, which gave her a standing ovation.
   ``I don't see aesthetically what national anthems have to do
with any country,'' she said after the ceremony.
   She said the incident taught her to be ``much more conscious of
other people's feelings and not so obsessed with my own.''
   The rap group 2 Live Crew performed ``Banned in the USA,'' a
version of Bruce Springsteen's ``Born in the USA.'' The performance
sparked a dance-fest by audience members who waved bumpers stickers
reading, ``Censorship is UnAmerican.''
   The rappers decried the banning of their explicit ``As Nasty as
They Wanna Be'' album from some record stores.
   ``It's a damn shame. It's racist,'' said lead singer Luther
Campbell.
   It was a disappointing night for last year's big winner, Laker
Girl-turned-megastar Paula Abdul, whose ``Opposites Attract'' video
was shut out, despite six nominations. Last year, Abdul won for
best female, dance, editing and choreography for her ``Straight
Up'' video.
   Michael Penn walked away with the new artist award for his
densely written ``No Myth'' and two older groups enjoying new
success also picked up awards: the B-52's for best group and art
direction for their exuberant ``Love Shack'' and Aerosmith for
metal-hard rock for ``Janie's Got a Gun.''
   Janet Jackson, sister of pop icon Michael Jackson, was named in
advance as the recipient of the 1990 Video Vanguard award, MTV's
highest honor.
   Noted more for onstage drawing power than historical
significance, the MTV Awards were broadcast live on the Music
Television cable channel from the Universal Amphitheater.
   Emceed by late-night talk-show host Arsenio Hall, the show's
lineup also included on-stage performances by Aerosmith, Jackson,
World Party, O'Connor and a one-time reunion of New Edition.
   Last year, comedian Andrew Dice Clay was forever banned from MTV
for delivering a routine laden with obscene and unprintable poems
about sex and overweight women during the video awards show.

<HEAD>Judge's Ruling Setback for Defense</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A judge's ruling has made it more difficult
for an art gallery and its director to fight obscenity charges for
displaying Robert Mapplethorpe's sexually graphic photographs, a
defense lawyer says.
   Hamilton County Municipal Judge David J. Albanese on Thursday
ordered the Contemporary Arts Center and director Dennis Barrie to
stand trial Sept. 24 on one misdemeanor count each of pandering
obscenity.
   Defense lawyers contend the 175-picture Mapplethorpe exhibition
_ mostly portraits and pictures of flowers _ isn't obscene when
viewed as a whole. But Albanese granted a prosecution request to
let a jury see only the five pictures that depict sex acts.
   ``I'm disappointed but I'm not surprised,'' Barrie's lawyer, H.
Louis Sirkin, said after the hearing. ``It certainly doesn't help
us.''
   Albanese said in a 12-page ruling that each photograph is a
separate work. He said prosecutors will only have to prove that one
is obscene to obtain a conviction.
   ``The court believes the retrospective is a vehicle for
displaying the five S&amp;M photographs,'' said Albanese, referring to
the shots as sadomasochistic.
   Barrie did not attend the hearing. He was at a Washington
fund-raiser to help pay the gallery's legal bills.
   He and the gallery already were scheduled for trial Sept. 24 on
charges of using children in material involving nudity. Albanese
said the combined trial could last 10 days.
   The child nudity charge is based on separate photographs in the
exhibition of a boy and a girl with their genitals exposed.
   Each charge carries a maximum penalty of six months in jail and
a $1,000 fine for Barrie, and a $5,000 fine for the gallery.
   Albanese rejected a defense argument to dismiss the obscenity
charge on the grounds that state obscenity law exempts legitimate
art displays.
   The charges were filed April 7, the day the exhibition opened to
the public. The exhibition attracted 81,000 people before closing
May 26.
   The Mapplethorpe exhibition opened Aug. 1 at the Institute for
Contemporary Art in Boston. On Wednesday, a court clerk in that
city refused a request to file obscenity charges.
   Defense lawyer Marc Mezibov asked Albanese whether he was aware
of the Boston ruling. Mezibov said it indicated the pictures have
artistic value that makes them immune from obscenity charges.
   Albanese said he had not read the ruling. But he noted that
Massachusetts obscenity law differs from Ohio law, and said the
Boston decision would have no bearing on the Cincinnati case.
   ``For all I know, the photographs may be in a different
arrangement, a different order. They may even be different
photographs,'' the judge said.

<HEAD>New Options to be Studied in Spotted Owl Plan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Members of a White House task force have been
asked to explore ``new options'' in their efforts to devise a plan
to balance protection of the northern spotted owl and timber jobs
in the Pacific Northwest.
   ``Clearly the principals are not satisfied that they have come
up with the best solution,'' Steve Goldstein, spokesman for
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan, said Thursday night.
   He said task force leaders told the panel's working members in a
meeting this week ``to begin exploring new options.''
   ``Secretary Lujan believes there are better options,'' Goldstein
said.
   Goldstein denied a report in today's Washington Post that the
task force had tentatively agreed to back a controversial proposal
by Forest Service biologist Jack Ward Thomas and other government
scientists to ban logging on millions of acres of old-growth forest
inhabited by the owl.
   ``Coming back with the Jack Ward Thomas plan would mean they
(members of the task force) did not fulfill their mandate,''
Goldstein said.
   Goldstein declined to say more about the new options being
explored.
   Kelly Shipp, spokeswoman for Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter, has also denied that any decision had been reached.
   Shipp said working members of the task force ``have made several
recommendations through the entire process, but a decision has not
been made yet.''
   She said she hoped the plan would be fully formed sometime next
week.
   The Interior and Agriculture departments are the government's
two forest-management departments. Most of the land involved is
managed by the Agriculture Department's Forest Service; some is
managed by Interior's Bureau of Land Management.
   A congressional aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity
said White House Chief of Staff John Sununu told Yeutter Wednesday
night that the Thomas report is ``simply unacceptable'' because of
its economic impact. The source said Sununu wants the panel to come
up with an owl protection plan similar to the one being implemented
by the Bureau of Land Management _ a plan that would have less
economic impact but which is opposed by environmentalists.
   Another congressional source said Thursday night the task force
is leaning toward adopting the Thomas report as an interim measure
and would recommend that President Bush and Congress work out a
permanent plan over the next year.
   An administration source who asked not to be identified said the
task force has concluded it will be more difficult to save timber
jobs than the task force originally had hoped.
   The Thomas plan called for setting aside large tracts of
old-growth forest where logging would be banned.
   Logging interests argued that this would cost 150,000 jobs. The
government, however, estimates the Thomas plan, along with other
industry changes, would cost 20,000 jobs by the year 2000.

   A high school sophomore who held nine
classmates hostage at gunpoint for five hours surrendered and was
taken to a psychiatric hospital. No one was injured during the
ordeal.
   ``I just wanted to leave the country,'' a smiling Randy Floyd
Addis, 17, said as authorities led him away Thursday from the South
Forsyth high school and middle school.
   Addis had demanded $3,000 before becoming dizzy and giving up
the siege. He was taken to Central State Hospital in Milledgeville
for evaluation.
   Sheriff Wesley Walraven of Forsyth County said Addis was charged
as an adult with kidnapping and weapons violations. Addis has a
juvenile arrest record, and suffers from epilepsy, among other
health problems, he said.
   Addis entered the school about 40 miles north of Atlanta with a
30.06 semiautomatic deer rifle, a single-shot 12-gauge shotgun, a
.25 caliber automatic pistol and black powder concealed in a duffel
bag as a science project.
   Walraven said Addis fired the rifle over the heads of students
in a civics class shortly before 8:30 a.m. A teacher wrestled the
rifle away, but Addis pulled a pistol and held about 40 students at
gunpoint.
   Addis periodically released all but nine hostages. Most of the
school's 1,200 students were evacuated and released to parents.
   About 1:45 p.m., Addis became dizzy and officers moved in to
take his weapons.

   The Soviet Union would be willing to provide
troops for a U.N. peacekeeping force in the Persian Gulf if they
were under a joint command that included Soviet generals, a Foreign
Ministry spokesman said today.
   A joint U.S.-Soviet military force under a United Nations banner
would be a historic first for the superpowers, who have been on
opposing sides of nearly every other global crisis since World War
II.
   U.S.-Soviet cooperation in the gulf crisis will be topic No. 1
on Sunday when Presidents Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev hold a
hastily arranged summit in Helsinki, Finland, spokesman for both
sides say.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said the
U.N. Security Council should revive article 47 of the United
Nations charter, which provides for a military staff committee
comprising representatives of the five permanent council members.
   ``We must put life into the military staff committee,''
Gerasimov said in an interview. ``The committee would be made up of
the five permanent members, and not by one member.''
   ``This committee will have military forces at its disposal. And
of course we will be ready to participate,'' he said.
   Asked whether one purpose of the proposal was to make sure
Soviet generals were in command of Soviet troops, to prevent
unilateral military action by the United States, Gerasimov said
``yes.''
   In the past, however, the United States and Britain have said
they would not place their troops under U.N. command.
   The military staff committee, inactive since 1946, consists of
senior officers from the United States, Soviet Union, China,
Britain and France.
   The Soviet Union voted with the United States on Security
Council resolutions condemning Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait,
ordering economic sanctions against Baghdad and authorizing
military means to enforce them.
   The Soviet Union has two warships in the gulf region, but they
are not playing a direct role in the U.S.-led naval interdiction of
ships carrying goods to and from Iraq.
   In Tokyo today, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
urged U.S. troops not to take unilateral action in the gulf, saying
the superpower summit will seek ways to resolve the crisis
peacefully.
   ``I don't think that U.S. troops would be well advised to take
some unilateral, one-sided punitive action,'' he said.
   Shevardnadze also confirmed there were about 180 Soviet military
advisors in Iraq, but he said the contingent is being reduced.
   In recent years, United Nations troops have been deployed only
to separate warring sides, monitor cease-fire lines and try to keep
the peace.
   Not since the Korean War of 1950-53 and Congo Rebellion of
1960-64 have U.N. soldiers undertaken a ``police action'' to
reverse aggression or put down a civil war.
   And in the Congo and Korea, at the height of the Cold War, the
United States and the Soviet Union were fiercely antagonistic.
   Gerasimov dismissed a proposal by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
to link the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait to Israel's
pullback from occupied territories.

<DATELINE>AQABA, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One month after the U.N. embargo of Iraq,
the once- bustling shipping business in the port of Aqaba is in the
doldrums and the thriving tourist trade has disappeared from the
palm-dotted shores.
   Much of the trade through Aqaba has been blocked by sanctions
against Iraq, heavily dependent on trade through Jordan, but most
people interviewed in the port expressed loyalty to Iraq's
President Saddam Hussein.
   They blamed Washington for the embargo that threatens the
livelihood of workers in the port that is Jordan's only outlet to
the sea.
   ``What about the human rights you are always talking about?''
one shopkeeper Eid Al-Sharari asked an American visitor. ``You are
going to murder me by stopping all the food from coming in.''
   Jordan has appealed for international aid to save its strapped
economy, further stretched by the U.N. embargo and the thousands of
Arab and Asian refugees crossing the border from Iraq.
   Al-Sharari said many prices have doubled since the embargo began
a month ago and supplies of rice, sugar and other staples were
running low.
   Tourists have been frightened away from Aqaba, a stopoff point
for the ancient ruins of Petra, 65 miles away and a preferred skin
diving spot. Tensions in the Middle East have emptied hotels.
   ``We had calls from Italy with people saying, `Why are you still
there? We heard Aqaba was occupied by the Americans,' '' said
Mohammed Zghoul, an assistant desk manager of one hotel.
   The port at the head of the Gulf of Aqaba, a finger of the Red
Sea between Arabia and the Sinai Peninsula, is an outlet for Iraq
as well as for Jordan.
   Since U.S. warships began monitoring vessels in the Persian
Gulf, traffic has dropped from more than six ships a day to two or
three, said Awad al-Tal, the port director.
   Insurance rates have shot up and now include a $1,400 surcharge
on each 40-foot cargo container and $35 per ton of cargo as of Aug.
25. With so few ships calling on the port, there are not enough to
carry goods out.
   Phosphate is a major export to Asian markets but is now being
stored in Aqaba, al-Tal said. Only half the monthly average of
650,000 tons was exported in August, he said.
   There are 2,400 permanent employees and 1,000 to 1,500 who work
on a daily basis, the port director said.
   ``We haven't fired anyone yet,'' he said.
   But the overtime that supplied much of the income here has been
eliminated, and al-Tal said there might be layoffs soon.
   The port was expected to handle 18 to 19 million tons of cargo
this year, al-Tal said. Of that, 30 percent was exports of
phosphate, potash, concrete, and other material, while 40 percent
was imported goods such as meat, sugar, grain, electronics and
automobiles.
   The remainder, al-Tal said, was transit trade, mostly to and
from Iraq, but also Saudi Arabia and Jordan's tariff-free zone.
   The director, port employees and residents of Aqaba say no Iraqi
goods are being transported now, in accordance with King Hussein's
decision to abide by the U.N. embargo. There were no evident
violations of the sanctions.
   Western diplomatic sources said that if severe violations were
discovered, Western support for aid to Jordan could erode. They
said minor violations were inevitable.
   For truck driver Mohammed Ali, trade had almost stopped.
   ``Since this started, nothing has come into my pocket,'' said
Ali, who has nine children and was expecting $45 for his first load
in a month.
   Stopped beside the narrow asphalt strip through the desert that
connects Aqaba to Amman, he prepared a lunch of lamb's liver in the
shade of a rig belonging to a friend, Said Khaleed.
   Khaleed's truck was broken and he was fixing it himself, an
all-day job, because he had no money to pay a mechanic.
   Both men spoke of their hostility toward the U.S. government and
fierce loyalty to Hussein.
   ``We're looking for death as you're looking for life,'' said
Ali. ``We're praying to Allah that nothing happens, but if it does,
we don't care.''

<TEXT>
   A Pennsylvania man has bought four
descendants of the famed miniature pony Misty and will move them
from their Chincoteague Island home, prompting an outcry from their
keeper.
   ``They're just saying nothing matters, no tradition, no Misty,''
Ruth Calvo said Thursday. ``What I care about is the history. It's
being destroyed.''
   Misty was made famous in the 1947 children's classic ``Misty of
Chincoteague'' by Marguerite Henry. The book was the first of a
series of tales she wrote about the herd of wild ponies that live
on the island in the Atlantic Ocean off Virginia's Eastern Shore.
   Each year, the horses are forced to complete a swim of 10 to 15
minutes across a quarter-mile-wide channel for auction on the
shore. Thousands of people gather to watch.
   Michael Pryor of Blue Ridge Summit, Penn., said Thursday he
bought Misty's descendants from Paul Merritt, who owns the Misty
Museum and Pony Farm, which Ms. Calvo manages. Pryor planned to
move the four ponies to Pennsylvania as soon as today. He would not
disclose the purchase price.
   Pryor said he already owns eight of Misty's descendants. He also
is leasing Stormy, Misty's daughter, and the stuffed carcass of
Misty.
   ``I know that we upset some people in taking the ponies off the
island of Chincoteague,'' Pryor said. ``The ponies will be there
during tourist season. That's where they should be.''
   ``I live in Pennsylvania, but I'm a Chincoteaguean at heart,''
he said.
   He said he travels with his horses to state fairs, schools for
handicapped children, hospitals, shopping malls and craft shows.
None of the horses travel more than once a week, Pryor said.
   Pryor, who said he also owns a restaurant, said he runs a
non-profit organization with the ponies _ Mike Pryor's Pony
Outreach. The money raised pays veterinarian bills and buys food
for the horses, with the rest going to handicapped children, he
said.
   Ms. Calvo said she hated to see the four ponies taken away. She
once owned the Misty site, but has not been able to make payments
since April so now manages it for Merritt.
   ``Pennsylvania is a nice state. I have nothing against it, but
it isn't Chincoteague,'' she said.
   Ms. Calvo also disputed ownership of two of the ponies. She said
she owns one, Wings of Mist, because he was born while she still
owned the museum-farm. Ms. Calvo said she gave the other pony to a
plumber who did extensive work for her and that he asked her to
keep him at the farm.
   Merritt said he owned all four horses.
   No one is sure how the herds of wild ponies got to the island.
   The most commonly accepted theory is that they are descendants
of horses hidden on the island by early settlers who wanted to
avoid paying taxes on the animals. Another theory has the ponies
washing ashore from shipwrecks during Colonial times.

   Pessimism about the U.S. economy pushed the dollar
sharply down against the Japanese yen today, while rumors about the
removal of Saddam Hussein buoyed the Tokyo Stock Exchange, up after
four straight days of losses.
   The dollar closed at 140.25 yen, down 1.40 yen from Thursday's
141.65 yen. The low for the day's trading was 140.00 and the high
was 141.00. It was the lowest closing value for the dollar since
141.55 yen on Oct. 25, 1989.
   Dollar sales by life insurance companies drove the dollar down,
one trader said on condition of anonymity.
   Short-covering kept the dollar from sinking below the
psychologically important 140-yen level in the morning. And a rumor
that Hussein had fled to Libya unleashed sharp selling in the
afternoon.
   ``But nobody took a long-dollar position,'' said the trader.
   Traders said the currency could drop below the 140-yen barrier
next week, reflecting wide pessimism about the U.S. economy.
   The trend could accelerate, especially if U.S. unemployment
figures for August, scheduled for release tonight Tokyo time, show
a rise in joblessness, pushing interest rates down.
   ``I expect the dollar to trade between 138.50 and 141.50 next
week,'' said Yoshikazu Kuroda, a currency trader at Fuji Bank.
   On the Tokyo Stock Market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues recovered from the lowest intraday trading of the
year to close at 23,962.07, up 150.16 points, or 0.63 percent. An
estimated 440 million first-section shares traded hands in moderate
trading.
   Rising oil prices and the overnight decline in Wall Street
dampened morning optimism centering around the yen's appreciation
against the dollar, dealers said.
   The price of benchmark Brent Crude for October delivery opened
in London at between $31.10 and $31.30 a barrel today.
   Dealers were also worried about the outcome of the weekend
summit between President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev in Helsinki. Arbitrage trading and the rapid fall on the
bond market, which heralded higher interest rates, also drove the
market down, traders said.
   Several rumors, mostly unfounded, shook the jittery afternoon
market, they said.
   ``In the afternoon, one rumor said that Hussein had fled. There
was another rumor of a coup d'etat, followed by a sharp rally,''
according to Yoshiro Inoue, an analyst at Nomura Securities. Both
rumors were unfounded.
   The market mood also improved on speculation that the Nihon
Keizai newspaper would review the list of industries represented in
the 225-stock index to reflect changes in the economy, and a new
average would curb price volatility.
   The newspaper did announce, after the markets closed, that it
was forming a committee to study the makeup of the average and
hoped to introduce a more accurate average next summer.
   Other stories circulating on the trading floor suggested that
the Ministry of Finance might be moving to boost the market, and
that a major brokerage house was going to lay off traders because
of recent market losses. Neither rumor has been confirmed.
   ``Brokers and institutional investors feel anxiety about the
direction of the market,''said Isao Takahashi, a trader for James
Capel Pacific. Some felt the market needed support as it headed
toward 23,000, inspiring a small technical rebound effect. Still,
he said, ``most brokerages and dealers are very bearish.''
   In bond dealings, the yield of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds finished the day almost even with
Thursday's level, closing at 8.250 percent, up slightly from
Thursday's close of 8.245 percent. The price stood at 82.46 points,
down from 82.48.

<HEAD>State Says Doctors Overprescribed Drugs to Elizabeth Taylor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State prosecutors have filed a complaint
charging three doctors with overprescribing addictive drugs to
Elizabeth Taylor, a television station reported.
   During a five-year period the doctors wrote for Miss Taylor more
than 1,000 prescriptions for 28 controlled substances, including
sleeping pills, pain killers and tranquilizers, KCBS-TV reported
Thursday.
   ``I think it goes beyond simple negligence,'' Earl R. Plowman,
deputy attorney general, told KCBS. ``With the kind of situation
that's been created, the patient could just as easily have killed
herself.''
   Named in the complaint were Drs. Michael J. Roth, William F.
Skinner and Michael S. Gottlieb. If the complaint is substantiated,
the State Medical Quality Assurance Board could suspend or revoke
their licenses.
   Roth is a longtime friend of Miss Taylor and has been her
physician for a decade. Skinner is medical director of the chemical
dependency center at St. John's hospital in Santa Monica. Gottlieb
is the immunologist who reported the first AIDS cases in the United
States is Roth's former partner.
   In a statement, Skinner defended his conduct and objected to the
inquiry by the state medical board. ``I used good professional
judgment treating a complex set of problems,'' he said.
   A message left at Roth's office after business hours was not
returned. There was no Los Angeles listing for Gottlieb.
   In 1983, Miss Taylor acknowledged a 35-year addiction to
sleeping pills and painkillers prescribed for health problems. She
went into treatment for alcohol and drug abuse that year at
Skinner's behest.
   An after-hours message left with Miss Taylor's publicist in New
York was not returned.

<DATELINE>DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Without a shooting war, most GI
casualties in the Saudi desert have been due to diarrhea, heat rash
and other ailments common to Americans moving to a foreign country.
   But the U.S. military has been building more than a dozen
hospitals in case the shooting began.
   Military doctors said in interviews that few of the 100,000-odd
U.S. troops have suffered from training accidents or illnesses
caused by the harsh desert environment.
   ``We've had some colds, some gastroenteritis,'' said Lt. Col.
Jim Mattis, who commands a Marine brigade encamped in the desert.
   Nevertheless, the U.S. military is erecting a sophisticated
network of medical facilities, including 15 hospitals capable of
providing virtually any type of surgery and care to injured
Americans should combat break out.
   ``We are fully capable of providing the best medical care in the
world,'' said Capt. Richard Mayo, head of a 500-bed Navy field
hospital housed in 24 air conditioned tents, each about 20 feet by
100 feet.
   Hundreds of doctors and nurses _ Mayo's hospital will have 800
medical personnel alone _ are either here or are on their way from
the United States.
   Their skills are so varied and the equipment is so sophisticated
that they will be able to perform neurosurgery, heart surgery and
orthopedic surgery.
   Field hospitals have laboratories, X-ray facilities, operating
rooms, dental clinics and psychiatric units.
   All supplies, from narcotics to hospital beds, have been sent
from the United States.
   U.S. military officials say troops in the oil-rich kingdom are
in a defensive posture, but the range of medical technology sent to
the Saudi desert underscores the degree to which officials want to
prepare for combat injuries.
   For the time being, doctors have been preoccupied with treating
training injuries and lesser medical complaints.
   Army officials said 14 people have been evacuated for medical
reasons, including three people who broke bones and two who
experienced psychological problems.
   But Maj. Jack Wright of Fayettville, N.C., a physician with the
44th Medical Brigade that controls hospitals for the Army, said
most complaints have been less serious.
   ``It's usually run of the mill kinds of thing,'' Wright said. He
sees about 40 people a day at an Army clinic.
   The most prevalent complaint is diarrhea, usually brought on by
a change in the water or the food. The Army regularly tests the
water to make sure it is safe to drink, he said.
   The stomach problem usually lasts about 24 hours and is
treatable with over-the-counter drugs.
   Colds and heat rashes are also common, medical authorities said.
   Despite scorching temperatures, few soldiers have come down with
dehydration, partly because the military has drilled into them the
importance of drinking enough water. Some men drink up to four
gallons a day.
   Fever is particularly dangerous in a hot climate so when
soldiers get one they are often given liquid intravenously to
prevent dehydration.
   In the desert, the big problems are sanitation and sand, Mattis
said.
   ``We have to keep the food out of the sand,'' he said. ``And we
have a wash rack built so people can wash their hands.''
   Before coming to Saudi Arabia, soldiers were given shots to
prevent cholera, meningitis and hepatitis.
   The environment also plays havoc with medical supplies,
according to Maj. Mike Calder, chief nurse at the 28th combat
support hospital.
   The 200-bed ``bubble'' facility _ blown-up rubberized tubes that
look like giant caterpillars _ is being set up in the desert.
   The heat tends to shorten the shelf-life of drugs, meaning it is
unlikely that unused medical supplies will be taken back to the
United States when Operation Desert Shield ends.

<HEAD>F.W. de Klerk To Meet Bush Sept. 24</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk will
meet President Bush on Sept. 24 in the first U.S. visit by a South
African leader in decades, a government official said today.
   De Klerk, who has launched wide-ranging reforms since assuming
power a year ago, was scheduled to meet Bush in June.
   But the visit was canceled after anti-apartheid groups in the
United States protested, saying Bush should first hold talks with
African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela.
   Mandela, who saw Bush in June, said it did not matter who met
first with the U.S. president. Mandela has said his movement has no
objections to a Bush-de Klerk meeting, but wants to United States
to maintain its limited economic sanctions against South Africa to
protest apartheid.
   A South African government source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said an official announcement of de Klerk's visit would
be made this afternoon.
   No South African leader has visited the United States since the
apartheid system of racial segregation was formally implemented in
the late 1940s, officials said.
   De Klerk says he wants to end apartheid and negotiate a new
constitution with opposition groups that would allow whites and
blacks to share power.
   Under apartheid, the 5 million whites dominate politics and the
economy and the 30 million blacks have no voice in national affairs.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crime in Czechoslovakia has risen
by 41 percent so far this year, and part of the increase is due to
the democratic changes that swept the Communists from power, the
government news agency CTK reports.
   Speaking to parliamentary deputies, Interior Minister Jan Langos
on Thursday confirmed has risen considerably, both due to the large
number of prisoners amnestied in January and the newly gained
freedoms of the population.
   ``The past period can be characterized by an increased activity
of criminal elements and the broad tolerance (shown) by the
population toward subjective interpretation of rights and freedoms
of the individual,'' Langos was quoted as saying.
   Czechoslovakia is preparing for communal local) elections in
November in an effort to strengthen the hold of pro-democracy
forces on lower levels of the state administration.
   Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel freed some 20,000 convicts
in January in an unprecedented amnesty, emptying two thirds of the
country's jails.
   Shortly afterward the crime rate rose in some areas of the
capital Prague by several hundred percent, police said.
   ``(The increase) is most visible in the attacks against the
property and health of citizens, including tourists from Western
states,'' the report said.
   While crime is on the rise, police work is made more difficult
due to the fact that the police force is often identified with the
dreaded STB secret police, one of the pillars of power of the past
Communist regime.
   Prostitution and drug addiction are going up as well. The
current estimate of prostitutes in Prague stands at 20,000.
   Two cases of heroin smuggling have been registered this year,
indicating Czechoslovakia could soon become a transit country on
the way from Asia to the wealthy countries of the West.
   Langos said a special department to combat drug trafficking was
set up on August 1, with special links to Interpol, the
international police organization.

   Rain fell in the Midwest early today and haze covered the South.
   Thunderstorms rolled across northern Ohio late Thursday. A
tornado was sighted in Geauga County but no injuries or damage were
reported.
   Elsewhere in Michigan, driving rains, high winds and lightning
tore down trees, damaged buildings and blacked out more than
115,000 power customers, officials said today.
   A Detroit Edison Co. spokesman Robert Dobkin said the company
hoped to restore power to most customers today.
   Showers developed over the Northeast today, with a low pressure
system extending from Illinois to northern Maine. High pressure was
expected to bring continued sunny, hot weather to the Southeast and
Deep South, with highs in the 90s. Thunderstorms were possible in
Florida and the southern tip of Texas.
   Rain fell early today in Chicago, Cleveland and Buffalo, N.Y.,
and a thunderstorm broke out in Pittsburgh.
   Partly sunny skies were forecast for the nation's midsection,
except for some showers in Nebraska, Oklahoma and Missouri.
   Arizona and New Mexico were in store for thunderstorms and
showers were also possible in Wyoming and Utah. Sunshine was
forecast for other Western states.
   The high temperature Thursday in the Lower 48 states was 106
degrees in Borrego Springs, Calif.

   The dollar rose today against most major foreign
currencies in early, cautious European trading. Gold prices fell
slightly.
   Trading was quiet ahead of the release of U.S. employment
figures for August, dealers said.
   The financial markets are looking to the figures for indications
that the U.S. economy is slowing perhaps toward a recession and the
Federal Reserve Board will have to reduce interest rates to spur
economic growth.
   The British pound fell after a statement by Chancellor of the
Exchequer John Major quashed speculation that the pound will join
the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System this
weekend.
   There had been speculation that Britain would use a meeting in
Rome of European Community finance ministers to announce the move.
Major said in an interview this morning that an announcement will
``certainly not'' be made in Rome.
   Britain is committed in principle to join the exchange rate
mechanism, which will stabilize the exchange rates of most major EC
currencies.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 1.40 yen to a closing 140.25 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 140.57 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Thursday:
   _1.5605 German marks, up from 1.5590
   _1.2990 Swiss francs, up from 1.2985
   _5.2280 French francs, up from 5.2168

   _1,163.75 Italian lire, up from 1,162.50
   _1.1593 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1575
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.8935, compared
with $1.9075 late Thursday.
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of
$388.85 at mid-morning, down from $389.50 Thursday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $388.80, unchanged from late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $0.64 to close at a bid $388.23.
   Silver traded in London at a bid price of $4.79 a troy ounce,

   A woman who suffered liver failure, apparently
from eating poisonous mushrooms, has received a donor liver in an
emergency transplant.
   Roberta Rigali, 55, was in critical but stable condition early
today at Bernard Mitchell Hospital at the University of Chicago
after the eight-hour operation Thursday, said Nicole Muse, a
hospital administrator.
   ``We expect she should have total or almost total recovery with
very little in the way of deficits,'' Dr. Thomas Brastitus said.
   Mrs. Rigali likely would have died without the transplant,
hospital spokesman John Easton said.
   Easton said he did not know where the donor liver came from.
   Mrs. Rigali prepared hamburgers with mushrooms picked last week
while she and her husband, William, were at their cottage in Dewey
Lake, Mich.
   She checked into a hospital Aug. 28 and went into a coma three
days later. Her husband also got sick but recovered.

<HEAD>Forum Head Criticizes U.S. Incineration Plans, Will Travel To
Washington</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SUVA, Fiji (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the 15-nation South Pacific Forum
today attacked U.S. plans to burn off chemical weapons at Johnston
Atoll, accusing Washington of treating Pacific residents as
``coconuts and guava.''
   Secretary-General Henry Naisali said four ministers from Forum
countries, whose governments represent about 25 million people,
will travel to Washington Sept. 17-19 for talks with U.S. officials
on the issue.
   The trip comes shortly before a deadline to transfer U.S.-owned
chemical weapon stocks from West Germany to Johnston, a remote
atoll 700 miles southwest of Hawaii, for incineration at a
specially built facility.
   ``I want the United States president and his advisers to please
listen and try to accomodate the fears and concerns ... of the
territories of the South Pacific and their peoples,'' Naisali told
a news conference.
   He cast doubt on U.S. assurances that the incineration process
at Johnston would be safe and shrugged off claims that similar
plants would be built on the continental United States, where most
American chemical weapons are stockpiled.
   ``Why bring them to our front yard in the Pacific?'' Mr Naisali
asked, referring to chemical weapons.
   ``You know why? Because they don't class us as human beings in
the Pacific. They class us as breadfruit, as coconuts and guava,
tapiocas and taros.''
   Washington had given ``no absolute guarantee'' that the
incineration would be safe and the Forum had no way to monitor the
burning, he said.
   He likened American safety claims to French assurances on their
underground nuclear test site at Mururoa Atoll. An independent
environmental report released last week said the atoll is leaking
radioactivity.
   ``Are we going to believe the Americans when we now know that
the French statement was wrong?'' he said. ``The same thing will
happen at Johnston island.
   ``The Americans are playing cheap politics with the people of
the South Pacific,'' he said.
   Some 100,000 rounds of nerve gas projectiles are to be shipped
to Johnston Atoll over the next few months. The U.S. Army plans to
store them at the facility and destroy them in an incinerator that
is still being tested.
   The weapons from West Germany would add 100,000 rounds to the
300,000 rounds of nerve and mustard gas stored at Johnston Atoll
since 1971.
   The tests on the incinerator are to be completed late next year,
and full-scale destruction of the weapons is not expected to begin
until 1992.
   The Army has said moving the weapons across the ocean and
destroying them at Johnston Atoll would have minimal public health,
safety and environmental effects.

<TEXT>
   The slayings of five students by a
killer who may still be on the loose have cast a pall over
festivities for the University of Florida football opener, normally
a high point of the new school year.
   The Gators play Oklahoma State on Saturday. A sellout crowd of
more than 72,000 is expected, but football was secondary as the
murder investigation continued.
   Canceled was the coming out party for Steve Spurrier, a former
star player who returned to his alma mater as coach nine months
ago. As the father of two daughters who attend the school, he is
trying to keep the game in perspective and prepare the team to play.
   ``This has just been a sad, sad thing for the whole community,''
Spurrier said.
   ``But again, as (school) President (John) Lombardi said this
week, we can't be held hostage by this situation. We've got to go
on with university life,'' he said.
   Instead of joining hands at pep rallies and attending parties,
some students are attending grief sessions with counselors to learn
how to cope with a tragedy psychologists say could affect the
campus for years.
   ``Usually there's excitement in the air with everybody talking
about the first game. Now it's gloom and doom,'' senior tight end
Kirk Kirkpatrick said. ``I'd be lying if I said it hadn't affected
our concentration. We're football players, but we're students,
also.''
   Four women and a man, all students at the University of Florida
or Santa Fe Community College, were slain last month in three
attacks.
   Norm Carlson, an assistant athletic director, has worked for the
university for 27 years and can't remember a time when the mood
before a game was as solemn.
   ``What's happened has really thrown everybody for a loss,'' he
said. ``It's been downright depressing around here. The students
seem to be doing a little better now. There's a lot of activity
around the stadium and you can sense them getting excited again.''
   There were other indications Thursday that students have
regrouped and are eager to get on with normal campus life.
   Music blared from dormitory windows and long lines formed at the
student ticket window outside the football stadium.
   A few blocks away, a huge banner advertised a post-game party at
a fraternity house and campus bookstores prepared for the increased
business football Saturdays bring.
   ``The mood is a little bit subdued, but I think it's picking up
more and more each day,'' senior associate athletic director Jeremy
Foley said.

   A United Airlines jetliner came within 300 feet of
rooftops in a residential neighborhood where two small planes have
crashed in little more than three years, a newspaper reported today.
   The wide-bodied Boeing 767 jet with 184 people on board was
headed for Logan International Airport in bad weather when it flew
about 800 feet lower that it should have over the Dorchester
neighborhood, The Boston Globe reported, citing information from a
flight data recorder.
   The newspaper said an air traffic controller ordered the pilot
to abandon approach during the June 7, 1989 incident. The plane
went around and landed safely.
   Last month, all three people on a twin-engine plane were killed
when it went down Dorchester and set two houses on fire.
   In June 1987, the pilot of a small plane was killed when it
crashed in Dorchester, destroying three homes and injuring three
people on the ground.
   The Federal Aviation Administration said the United pilot made a
bad approach. The FAA suspended the flight certificates of the
pilot and first officer, whose names have not been released, but
waived further penalties because they reported the incident.

<TEXT>
   Linda Mae Walker wasn't interested in the
car, the house or the china during her divorce. She wanted her
snake, and she got it after a judge threatened to jail her
ex-husband.
   Walker, 42, was awarded Samson, a 14-foot Indian python, in a
property settlement from her July 18 divorce. But her former
husband, Terry D. Warren, wouldn't turn over the snake.
   On Wednesday, Circuit Judge Gene Schnelz told Warren to give
Walker the snake or go to jail. Warren initially picked jail but
reconsidered when Schnelz told him he'd stay there until the snake
was returned to Walker.
   Walker picked up Samson later Wednesday.
   ``I just got my baby home,'' said Walker, who has two children
and a another, smaller snake. ``I love him a lot. I missed him a
lot.''
   Samson appeared happy to be home, she said.
   ``He's crawling all over.''

<TEXT>
   Typhoon Dot, packing 105-mile-an-hour
winds, triggered landslides and cut of transportation in Taiwan
today after flooding thousands of people from their homes in the
Philippines.
   Police said a 65-year-old man in Taipei was killed by falling
objects, and another man was reported to have been swept out to sea
while fishing in northeast Taiwan.
   The Central Weather Bureau said Dot was off the coast about 75
miles east of Taitung in eastern Taiwan at 5:00 p.m. (5 a.m. EDT).
It was moving northwest at 15 mph. Weathermen said the typhoon had
winds of 105 mph and covered a large radius of about 220 miles.
   All domestic flights and most train services were canceled due
to strong winds. Landslides also blocked highways in several
eastern cities.
   Most schools and government agencies across the island closed
this afternoon to prevent people from being stranded by strong
winds and heavy rains.
   The typhoon was expected to sweep past send Taiwan Saturday and
move toward toward China's Fujian province.
   Earlier today, Dot left the Philippines, where it hit Manila and
central Luzon Island. No injuries were reported, but officials said
about 8,000 people fled their homes because of flooding in suburban
Quezon City and Pasig.
   Several schools and colleges sent students home early. The
state-owned Philippines Airlines canceled flights to and from four
towns on Luzon and Mindoro Islands.
   About one-third of traders and brokers with the Manila Stock
Exchange were unable to reach the trading floor because of the
flooding, officials said. that waters in the area would be
dangerous to all types of sea craft.
   Floods from monsoon rains have killed at least 65 people and
forced tens of thousands to flee their homes in Manila and northern
Philippine provinces since Aug. 24.

   Forget wood and brick. Try a
house built of coal _ 80 tons of it.
   When David Myles, a former coal operator, retired in 1961, he
didn't want to leave behind the black mineral entirely.
   ``I just thought it would be pretty,'' Myles, 84, said of his
coal house.
   Myles' wife, Quindora, and others weren't sure it could be done.
   ``Everybody thought he was crazy when he started,'' she said.
``But he put a white roof and white trim on it and it looked pretty
good. Everybody loves it now.''
   On the inside, the home looks like any other: drywalled and
painted, with carpeting and windows. But the outside is made of
eight-inch-thick blocks of coal, varnished every five years so it
won't crumble from exposure to oxygen.
   Myles said he cut the blocks with an electric saw, which soon
broke. Workers finally discovered that sharp hatchets did the
trick, he said.
   The six-room house, started in 1961, took six months to build.
Myles later added a three-room addition for an elderly uncle.
   At the time, the house cost less to build than it would to build
a brick home. But today, it would be much too expensive, Myles said.
   There are benefits as there's no need for air conditioning or
heating because, since the coal is so thick, Mrs. Myles said.
   Visitors frequently if the couple is afraid their house will
ever catch fire.
   The Myles say it's highly unlikely because of coal's
high-ignition temperatures.

<HEAD>Pitched Battle as Army Tries to Rout Tamil Rebels in Northeast</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Government troops and Tamil rebels
fought pitched battles in the northeast as the army tried to expand
its control after breaking the rebel siege of a strategic garrison,
military officials said today.
   They said 17 Tamil Tiger guerrillas and eight soldiers were
killed in Thursday's fighting near Chilawatte in the Mullaitivu
district on the seacoast south of the Jaffna Peninsula, the
northern end of this island nation.
   The Tigers' 10-week siege of the army garrison at Mullaitivu
town was broken Monday, officials have reported.
   Mullaitivu is 60 miles southeast of Jaffna town, where the
government's efforts to break another Tamil siege, of a 17th
century fort, have been at a standstill for two weeks.
   More than 200 policemen and soldiers have been trapped in Jaffna
Fort for nearly three months, with air force helicopters managing
to make occasional drops of food and blocks of ice that melt into
drinking water.
   The military officials said on condition of anonymity the Tigers
continued their attacks Thursday on Jaffna Fort, killing one
policeman and one soldier.
   Officials say at least 13 government defenders in the fort have
been killed since June 11 when the Tamil rebels broke a
13-month-old cease-fire and renewed their separatist war against
the Sinhalese-controlled government.
   There was no independent confirmation of the reports.
Communications with the region have been cut, and the Tigers issue
only periodic battle reports, usually from offices in Europe.
   The Tamil war for a separate homeland started in 1983 when the
Tigers and other militant groups embarked on a campaign of
guerrilla attacks on the government and massacres of Sinhalese
civilians. At least 14,000 people have been killed since then.
   The Tamils, who make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million
people, accuse the Sinhalese of discriminating against them in jobs
and education.
   The Sinhalese, who have dominated the government and military
since the Indian Ocean island became independent from Britain in
1948, comprise 75 percent of the population.

<HEAD>Emotional Pontiff Sees Dying AIDS Patients in Hospital</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II toured a Burundi
hospital crowded with dying AIDS victims today and said he shared
their suffering.
   ``I know the moment is difficult,'' he told 650 patients at the
Prince-Regent Charles Hospital on the last day of his three-day
visit to this central African nation.
   ``I think especially of those among you who are afflicted by
AIDS, for which there is still no effective cure. But I want to
tell you, in the name of faith, that you have reason for hope and
you are not alone in your ordeal.''
   The pontiff, who toured the hospital before flying to
neighboring Rwanda on the third leg of his 10-day African tour, was
told by doctors that 85 percent of patients in two wards suffered
from AIDS. Most were in an advanced stage of the disease, the
doctors said.
   John Paul, visibly moved, stopped at the bedsides of about 40
men and women, patting their heads and touching their foreheads in
the sign of the cross.
   At the end of the visit, he instructed Archbishop Giovanbatista
Re, the Vatican's undersecretary of state, to write out a check for
$10,000 as a donation to the hospital.
   There are no reliable estimates of AIDS cases in this former
Belgian colony of 6 million people. But health officials say up to
40 percent of young urban adults in some areas could be infected
with the AIDS virus.
   The World Health Organization estimates that 5 million Africans
are infected.
   It was the third time the pope has spoken about AIDS during his
African pilgrimage. In Tanzania last week, he called for a global
effort to combat the virus and reaffirmed the church's rejection of
the use of condoms as a means to check the spread.
   Before leaving, the Roman Catholic leader ordained 22 priests
from Burundi and three from neighboring Zaire during a Mass
attended by tens of thousands of pilgrims in a sprawling meadow on
the outskirts of the capital.
   The new priests, clad in green capes, knelt one by one at the
pontiff's feet to receive his embrace.
   The ceremony marked a record number of ordinations in Burundi, a
predominantly Catholic country that only three years ago emerged
from a bitter conflict between church and state.
   Under the previous military regime that President Pierre Buyoya
toppled in 1987, foreign missionaries were expelled, local priests
were detained and some churches were closed.
   Buyoya, a Catholic, restored full freedom to the church in his
efforts to unify a nation long scarred by ethnic bloodshed.
   After his visit to Rwanda, a former Belgian protectorate, the
pope will travel Sunday to the Ivory Coast on the last leg of his
seventh trip to Africa.

<HEAD>Isidore Becomes a Hurricane, Turning to North Far From Land in
Atlantic</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Rewrites throughout to UPDATE with storm strengthening to 80
mph, turning toward the north. No pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hurricane Isidore's top sustained winds were up to
80 mph this morning, but an early turn toward the north could
signal the storm will never threaten land, forecatserrs said.
   Isidore, which reached hurricane strength late Thursday,
remained in the eastern Atlantic on a northeasterly heading at 13
mph, said Max Mayfield, a specialist at the National Hurricane
Center in suburban Coral Gables.
   ``It's not a threat to any land mass at this time, and it has
turned up towards the northwest much earlier than most storms do in
that area,'' Mayfield said.
   ``That's really good news,'' he said. ``The farther north it
gets out there, the less likely it is to affect the Caribbean and
the United States.''
   Isidore could stengthen slightly in the next day or so, but has
shown no early signs of becoming a major hurricane, he said.
   At 6 a.m. EDT, Isidore's center was located near 17.6 degrees
north latitude and 37.9 west longitude, or about 800 miles west of
the Cape Verde Islands.
   The system was expecting to maintain its course and speed for
the next 24 hours.
   Isidore is the ninth named storm of the 1990 Atlantic hurricane.
Tropical storms are named when their maximum sustained winds reach
39 mph; they are ranked as hurricanes if their wind speed reaches
74 mph.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of Chinese have flooded a McDonald's
office in southern China where the American fast-food giant is
hiring employees for its first restaurant in this communist nation,
a company official said today.
   McDonald's plans to open a 500-seat restaurant in the economic
boomtown of Shenzhen, near Hong Kong, on Oct. 8, said company
spokeswoman Angela Bassage in Hong Kong.
   Two Shenzhen newspaper ads this week drew more than 6,000
applicants for 240 part-time jobs, an official at the Shenzhen
McDonald's said on condition of anonymity. Some applicants held
university degrees, he said.
   ``It was pretty chaotic when the huge number of people raided
our ... office. We're now busy deciding who to pick,'' he said.
   A second office had to be opened to accommodate the crowd, he
said.
   The newspaper ads, displaying the traditional McDonald's striped
shirts with matching caps, read: ``More than 200 youths in Shenzhen
are going to put on this uniform, a symbol of a prosperous future.
As an aggressive person, what are you waiting for?''
   The new recruits must work 12 hours a week, the ads said. Wages
were not given.
   The restaurant will be operated by McDonald's Shenzhen Ltd., a
subsidiary of McDonald's Hong Kong, which is a 50-50 joint venture
with McDonald's in the United States. It will be managed by a
Chinese national, Ms. Bassage said.
   She said the restaurant hopes to serve 10 million burgers a
year, far fewer than the popular Moscow McDonald's which makes
50,000 burgers daily, or more than 18 million in a year.
   Ingredients will be shipped in from Hong Kong initially, but
Chinese potatoes eventually may be used, she said.
   McDonald's plans to open a restaurant in Beijing in 1992, she
said.
   Beijing's only foreign fast-food restaurant is Kentucky Fried
Chicken, which runs four popular restaurants. Pizza Hut will open a
restaurant in Beijing on Monday, its first in China.

<HEAD>Reports: Phones Of Politicians, Journalists Tapped in Israel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel's phone-tapping scandal widened today
amid reports that private investigators illegally tapped phones of
more than 20 journalists and possible witnesses in an investigation
of a Cabinet official.
   Interior Minister Aryeh Deri is being questioned on suspicion of
illegally funneling public funds to religious institutions that he
controls. He is a member of the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party.
   Israel army radio said today that police would complete their
investigation in about two weeks and were expected to recommend
charges against Deri. The report did not name the possible charges.
   If Deri stands trial, it could rattle the government of Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir. A coalition, led by Shamir's right-wing
Likud bloc, has a 62-seat majority in the 120-seat Parliament and
needs the five seats of Shas to govern.
   Police believe three private investigating firms tapped phone
lines in municipal officials in Jerusalem and newspaper offices in
Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, according to today's media reports.
   But a Tel Aviv police official denied the stories, saying they
were ``nonsense.'' She spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The bugging scandal surfaced last week with reports that five
people had been arrested on suspicion of tapping the phone of
Mordechai Gilat, an investigative reporter for the Yediot Ahronot
newspaper. Gilat had written a series of exposes on Deri in June.
   A tape allegedly containing a recording of a conversation
between Gilat and Police Commissioner Yaacov Turner was discovered
earlier this week. Reports said Turner's phone may have been bugged
as well.
   Deri, meanwhile, suggested the left-of-center Labor Party was
responsible for the investigation. He indicated it could have
started as an attempt to prevent the formation of Shamir's
coalition on June 11.
   ``Somebody decided to torpedo the formation of a right-wing
government,'' Deri told the weekly newspaper Kol Hair.
   ``Only six days before the formation of the new right-wing
government did police start to investigate accusations against me.
Only one day before the new government was presented, investigators
confiscated material from the Interior Ministry,'' Deri said.
   Shas was responsible for toppling the previous Likud-Labor
coalition on March 15. During the subsequent wrangling for power,
both Labor and Likud tried to lure Shas onto their sides.

   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, winding up a
global fund-raising mission, said today Japan and South Korea have
given new assurances of support for the massive economic and
military campaign against Iraq.
   But no specific dollar figures were provided following Brady's
talks today with Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, or in an
earlier meeting in Seoul with South Korean President Roh Tae-woo.
   Brady met for an hour with Kaifu, after which he said, ``We have
a very serious problem. It is gratifying to know of Japan's
support.''
   A Japanese official, briefing reporters after the Brady-Kaifu
meeting, said ``Japan will make the utmost contribution. ... We
have to do what we have to do.''
   However, the official refused to provide any specifics of how
that pledge would be translated into additional contributions.
Japan earlier announced about $1 billion in support.
   Brady's meeting with Kaifu was the final stop on a four-day,
18,500 mile journey that took him from Paris to London to Seoul to
Tokyo. However, in none of the cases did the world leaders provide
any specifics about how much they would contribute, saying in most
cases that they needed more time to review the requests.
   However, it appeared that a second fund raising mission headed
by Secretary of State James A. Baker III was having more luck.
   While no figures were given, officials said that Saudi Arabia
had committed several billion dollars with an offer to pick up all
fuel, water and transportation costs associated with maintaining
the 60,000 U.S. troops now stationed in Saudi Arabia.
   Brady, talking to reporters in Seoul after his meeting with Roh,
said he had not expected an immediate answer to the American
request for help in defraying the cost of the U.S. military buildup.
   Brady also was seeking aid for Jordan, Turkey and Egypt, whose
economies have been severely hurt by the United Nations' supported
trade embargo against Iraq. He said the United States was hoping to
get funds flowing to the so-called front line states by the end of
this month.
   There have been reports South Korea is reluctant to commit
significant resources to the campaign against Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein because of fear of jeopardizing construction
contracts in both Iraq and Kuwait worth well over $1 billion.
   Brady said Roh raised these concerns in a ``tangential way''
during their meeting but he said he pointed out to the South Korean
leader the huge stake his country has in keeping the price of oil
from escalating.
   ``Every $10 increase in the price of a barrel of oil means a
$2.5 billion cost to the Korean economy,'' Brady said.
   Brady insisted that he has received strong words of
encouragement at every stop, and he questioned the accuracy of
reports that various countries are balking at the American aid
request.
   ``There are particular problems that every country has, but the
logic is compelling. We want to make sure these sanctions work,''
he said.
   Still, Brady's high-level delegation appeared to be having a
tougher selling job than the Baker mission to oil-rich Middle East
countries.
   Officials traveling with Brady insisted that the aid will be
forthcoming once the allies have time to study the specific
requests presented to them.
   However, in their meetings with world leaders, the U.S.
delegation has stressed that time is in short supply, especially in
Jordan, Egypt and Turkey, which are facing massive costs connected
to their support of the U.N.-sanctioned trade embargo against Iraq.

   Fourteen years of piano training and
a degree in music were Miss Illinois Marjorie Judith Vincent's
ticket to winning the last of three preliminary talent competitions
in the Miss America Pageant.
   The classical pianist from Oak Park, Ill., impressed a panel of
preliminary judges with ``Fantasy Impromptu'' by Frederic Chopin.
   ``I was surprised. I really was. There were so many good talents
in my group,'' she said afterward.
   ``I am difficult on myself as an artist and I felt I could do
better,'' said Miss Vincent, 25, this year's only black contestant.
   Despite an undergraduate degree in music, she has no plans to
make it a career. Miss Vincent is in her third year at Duke
University Law School and hopes to go into corporate law, with an
emphasis on international relations.
   The final swimsuit preliminary competition was won by Miss
Mississippi Beth Howell. Miss Howell, 21, a pharmacy student at the
University of Mississippi and sometime model, said her modeling
experience enhanced her self-confidence.
   ``I don't really feel any pressure being on stage,'' she said.
``There's nothing like feeling right up on the stage and that's
important for swimsuit competition.''
   The 50 Miss America hopefuls are divided into three groups, who
compete in talent, swimsuit and evening gown divisions on three
successive nights to qualify for Saturday's finals.
   At that time, the top 10 finishers will be announced and compete
during a nationally televised final with Gary Collins and Miss
America 1971 Phyllis George as co-hosts.
   The 50 contestants are vying to succeed Miss America 1990 Debbye
Turner. Miss America 1991 wins a scholarship of $35,000.
   Thursday was the last of three preliminary competitions.
   On Tuesday, Miss Texas Suzanne Lawrence won the first talent
competition and Miss Colorado Karrie Mitchell won the first
swimsuit competition.
   On Wednesday, Miss North Carolina Scarlet Morgan won the second
talent competition and Miss Florida Dana Rinehart Dalton won the
second swimsuit competition.
   The winners of the three preliminary evening gown competitions
are not announced until Saturday night's finals.

<HEAD>Commodity Markets Abuzz Over Possible Soviet Credits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commodity markets have been buzzing for days
about the possibility of a credit arrangement for Moscow when
President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev meet this
weekend.
   The administration favors liberalized trade and would like to
see the United States grant most-favored-nation, or low tariff,
status to the Soviet Union. But this would depend on Moscow
changing policies to allow free emigration of its citizens.
   For nearly two decades, the Soviet Union has been a major force
in U.S. agriculture _ a lucrative but sometimes erratic customer.
   Japan is a larger buyer of total U.S. commodities, but the
Soviets' annual grain orders stir excitement around the world. Farm
exports to Japan last year were valued at nearly $8.2 billion,
compared with $3.6 billion for the Soviet Union.
   Many farm leaders want most-favored-nation, or MFN, status for
the Soviet Union and a solution to the hangup over immigration. New
credit deals would sprout, helping sell more U.S. wheat, corn and
soybeans.
   Whether this comes up between Bush and Gorbachev at their
meeting in Helsinki, Finland on Sunday is conjecture at this point.
The crisis in the Mideast is paramount.
   But just in case the recent bread shortages in Moscow prompt
Gorbachev to ask about an emergency loan to buy U.S. grain, it
would be warmly applauded by American wheat farmers who have seen
prices plummet in the wake of a bumper harvest this summer.
   Don Lipton of the American Farm Bureau Federation's office here
said Thursday the organization favors MFN status for the Soviet
Union and realizes that emigration policies are a stumbling block.
   However, he said, if the White House works out a special
arrangement for Bush to present in Helsinki, it would be
``something we would support'' conditionally if it met all the
legal specifications.
   Leland Swenson, president of the National Farmers Union, said
from his Denver office that his members support MFN for the Soviet
Union.
   But Swenson added that many other factors come to bear over the
longer pull, including the question of long-term credit, subsidized
sales of grain and other issues that affect U.S.-Soviet relations.
   The United States has been selling millions of tons of grain to
Moscow at cut-rate prices under the Agriculture Department's Export
Enhancement Program, or EEP, since it was authorized five years ago.
   As of Aug. 30, the Soviet Union had bought 21.3 million metric
tons of wheat under the EEP subsidy arrangement.
   No dollar estimate was available, but the monthly report showed
the Soviet wheat deals under the program accounted for 28 percent
of the five-year total sold to all eligible foreign countries.
   The Soviet Union banged into the world grain market as a major
importer in 1971 with a $150 million purchase of U.S. corn, barley
and oats.
   Traditionally, except for a few times in the mid-1960s, the
Soviet Union had been a net exporter of grain. Suddenly, Russia was
on the loose as a major buyer.
   The conventional wisdom in USDA at the time proved correct. The
Soviets indeed wanted to boost food production and needed to import
more grain to do it. But the department grossly underestimated the
magnitude of Moscow's needs.
   On July 8, 1972, then-President Nixon announced a $750 million
credit arrangement for the Soviet Union to buy U.S. wheat and feed
grains. It was only the tip of an export iceberg.
   Secretly, private grain traders sold millions of tons of U.S.
grain, mostly wheat, to Moscow, for cash while the Nixon credit
deal was being worked out. By August, it was apparent that the
Russians had bought about 19 million tons of grain during the
summer of 1972 _ and at subsidized prices in effect at the time.
   The transactions, carried out by large multinational grain
companies, led to congressional investigations and accusations that
USDA insiders had worked with the private trade in the dealings.
   Grain prices soared, contributing to higher food costs for
American consumers. Eventually, Congress insisted on daily and
weekly public reporting of larger commodity sales to foreign
buyers, a system in effect today.
   Meanwhile, the Soviet Union used most of its $750 million line
of credit announced on July 8, 1972, but the authorization ran out
with about $200 million left on the books _ the equivalent of
around $600 million at current prices.
   Since those beginnings almost 20 years ago, the Soviet Union has
paid more than $25 billion for more than 231 million tons of U.S.
wheat and corn.
   The total since the 1972 credit deal included 78.4 million tons
of wheat and 152.8 million tons of corn. This year's entire U.S.
wheat crop was about 73.6 million tons, and the corn crop is
estimated by USDA at 199.4 million tons.

<HEAD>Government Ordered To Pay Man Who Lost Arm to Gator</HEAD>

   The federal government has been ordered
to pay more than $770,000 in damages to a man whose arm was bitten
off by a 500-pound, 11{-foot alligator in a national forest.
   U.S. District Judge Robert E. Varner, in a ruling made public
Thursday, awarded more than $650,000 to Kermit H. George Jr. for
his pain and suffering, along with sums for medical costs and other
damages.
   The award of damages followed an April 30 ruling in which Varner
found that the U.S. Forest Service had received complaints about
alligators in the Conecuh National Forest but had failed to post
signs warning of the danger.
   On July 26, 1986, George was swimming in a public pond in the
Conecuh forest, not far from his hometown of Florala, when the
alligator attacked him.
   George, who was 42 at the time, was an experienced electronics
engineer who also did land surveying and construction consulting
part time. He had been riding his bicycle and had stopped at a
roped-off swimming area to cool off. He was in chest-deep water at
the time of the attack.
   George was with his dog, a part Doberman pinscher. The dog
wasn't on a leash, and the government argued that George had
attracted the alligator by letting the dog run free in violation of
the park's leash law.
   Varner said it was unlikely the dog had attracted the alligator,
even though alligators ``enjoy dog meat.''
   ``The preponderance of the evidence shows that alligators are
not discriminatory in their tastes and are well known to dine on
whatever is convenient,'' the judge wrote in the April ruling.

<TEXT>
   The nation's unemployment rate rose in August
for the second consecutive month, climbing to 5.6 percent for the
highest jobless rate in two years, the government said today.
   Last month's rise in the civilian jobless rate, up from July's
rate of 5.5 percent, brought unemployment to its highest level
since the 5.7 percent rate posted in March 1988, the Labor
Department said. The nation's jobless rate had also hit 5.6 percent
in August 1988.
   Analysts said the report showed fresh evidence that the U.S.
economy is either already in a recession or about to topple into
one.
   ``It's becoming clear that we are sliding into a recession,''
said Martin Regalia, chief economist at the National Council of
Savings Institutions. ``If it's not quite flatlined, it's time to
get the jumper cables out and do something.''
   The weak employment report would probably renew pressure on the
Federal Reserve to lower interest rates to spur the economy,
private economists said.
   The rise in unemployment was largely caused by the economy's
failure to produce many new jobs last month, the government said.
In fact, all business payrolls actually fell by a total of 75,000,
but much of that was caused by the thousands of federal census
workers who were laid off, the government said.
   Still, private industries overall lost 12,000 jobs as well, with
the slump in the construction and manufacturing sectors continuing.
   Analysts had been bracing for weak payroll numbers in August,
which they blamed in part on the Middle East crisis, saying it
probably had unnerved businesses and kept them from hiring new
workers.
   However, the U.S. economy has been sluggish for months. The
Middle East conflict has not had time yet to fully impact the
nation's economy, analysts said.
   ``It's really a question of whether the oil shock is going to
tip it over,'' said Robert Dederick, chief economist at the
Northern Trust Co. of Chicago.
   ``The economy had reached a virtual standstill. Will this now
push it down into negative territory?'' Dederick asked.
   The nation's jobless rate is derived from a household survey,
but most economists consider a separate survey of business
establishments _ from which the government gets its figures on how
many new jobs were created in a given month _ a better barometer of
economic activity.
   The nation's manufacturing slump continued in August, as factory
jobs posted a 45,000 loss. It was the 16th time out of 17 months
that manufacturing jobs declined.
   Since reaching a post-recession peak in January 1989, the
manufacturing sector has lost 455,000 jobs, the government said.
Industries with the largest losses include electronic equipment,
which has lost 100,000 jobs, motor vehicles, which has lost 80,000,
and apparel, which has posted a 55,000 job loss.
   Meanwhile in August, the construction industry continued to
suffer as well. Those payrolls fell by 40,000 jobs, after a
seasonal adjustment, posting the sixth consecutive decline to
reflect continued weakness in the housing market. The construction
industry has lost nearly 100,000 jobs in the past three months
alone.
   The service sector, which until a few months ago had been adding
huge numbers of new jobs and virtually carrying the rest of the
economy, continued on its recent trend of showing weakness. Service
sector jobs increased by a relatively low 17,000 jobs.
   Health services, which had added an average of 50,000 jobs each
month in the first half of this year, continued to show robust
gains, posting a 44,000 jobs increase last month.
   Labor costs, which have been rising and are being blamed for
worsening the nation's inflation problems, rose only moderately in
August.
   Average hourly earnings posted a 0.2 percent rise last month to
$10.09, up from the $10.07 the average worker earned per hour in
July.
   The Labor Department's household survey showed that overall,
total civilian employment was about 117.7 million in August, down
from the 118 million employed in July.
   The jobless numbered 7 million, up from 6.8 million unemployed
in July.
   The average manufacturing work week was 41 hours in August, up
from the 40.9 hours in July. Manufacturing overtime was 3.9 hours
in August, a slight increase over July's average of 3.8 overtime
hours.
   Before July and August of this year, the jobless rate had held
relatively stable for much of the past year, fluctuating within a
narrow range of 5.3 percent. Many analysts have said the
unemployment rate was able to stay relatively low, despite the
sluggish economy, because fewer Americans are entering the labor
force.
   The unemployment rate among major demographic groups last month
were:
   _Adult white men, 4.3 percent, up from 4.1 percent in July.
   _Adult white women, 4.2 percent, up from 4.0 percent.
   _White teen-agers, 13.2 percent, up from 12.3 percent.
   _All blacks, 11.8 percent, up from 11.3 percent.
   _Adult black men, 10.6 percent, down from 10.7 percent.
   _Adult black women, 9.9 percent, up from 9.4 percent.
   _Black teen-agers, 35 percent, up from 31.2 percent.
   _Hispanics, 7.8 percent, down from 7.9 percent.
   In a separate calculation of unemployment that counts members of
the armed services stationed in the United States, the August
jobless rate was 5.5 percent, up from the 5.4 percent in July but
still better than August's civilian rate of 5.6 percent.

<TEXT>
   Edward Bowles, an electrical engineer who played
an important role in developing radar in World War II, has died of
Parkinson's disease after suffering a series of strokes. He was 92.
   His family said he died Wednesday in a Weston nursing home.
   As a consultant to the secretary of war, Bowles was asked to
devise a way to combat German submarines that were sinking merchant
ships in the North Atlantic.
   Having been a microwave specialist at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, he set up a laboratory at Langley Field,
Va., where Army Air Corps bombers were equipped with radar
developed at the university.
   In 1945, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for his
wartime efforts.
   Bowles was born in Westphalia, Mo. He received his bachelor's
degree from Washington University in St. Louis and a master's from
MIT, where he began teaching in 1921. He became an expert in what
was then the new field of radio.
   Bowles pioneered the development of the multivibrator, by which
a tuning fork, and later a crystal, could be used to maintain a
precise radio frequency. He began a division of electrical
communications at MIT in the mid-1920s.

   The United States, the Soviet Union and four
other countries today failed to reach full agreement on the final
plan for German unification, the East German news agency ADN said.
   While unification is bound to go forward as scheduled on Oct. 3,
today's talks indicate there may be some hard bargaining before
then. Negotiators said ``a few open questions'' will have to be
resolved at next week's foreign ministers' meeting in Moscow,
according to ADN.
   There was no immediate indication of what the sticking points
might be.
   News reports have said there were disagreements over the
timetable for withdrawing Soviet troops from what is now East
Germany.
   The U.S., Soviet, British, French representatives _ who have
been joined by negotiators from East and West Germany _ had hoped
to have the final plan worked out before Wednesday's foreign
ministers' session.
   It is to be the final session of the six-nation talks that began
in May in the West German capital of Bonn.

<TEXT>
   An Iraqi Airways jetliner with 171 American
women and children on board landed in Jordan today, the first
U.S.-chartered airlift to arrive from conquered Kuwait.
   The Americans described conditions in Kuwait, which was taken
over on Aug. 2 by Iraq, as appalling. They said foreigners are
terrified of Iraq's occupation forces, who have been rounding up
Westerners.
   ``It's terrible there. People are frightened, they're in hiding,
running out of food,'' said Patricia Hammer of Denver, Colo.
   She said she was shot at by Iraqi troops when she tried to
escape from Kuwait across the desert several weeks ago. She said
she was abandoned by her escorts and later saved by Bedouins.
   ``We made our way back to Kuwait where I hid, moving from flat
to flat,'' she said. Ms. Hammer said she registered with the U.S.
Embassy in Kuwait for the special flight two days ago.
   ``This morning, I dressed up in a black veil like an Iranian
Shiite woman and made my way to the pickup point. A Kuwaiti friend
followed me to make sure I got there,'' she said.
   The flight made a stop in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, where
passengers picked up Iraqi exit permits. A U.S. Embassy source at
the airport in Amman said 171 American women and children were
aboard the charter. Earlier reports had put the number at 170.
   Hundreds of Western women and children held by Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein have been allowed to leave, but men are being kept
as human shields against attack.
   A woman who identified herself only as Ruthie, from Memphis,
Tenn., said she had to leave her husband behind. She was traveling
with her three children, ages eight, seven and three.
   ``Many people are still hiding in their homes and are very
afraid,'' she said.
   Mary Willett, 35, of Chicago, said of the situation in Kuwait:
``It's a disaster.''
   Another evacuee, Maureen Aldakheel of St. Louis, was asked what
she thought President Bush should do.
   `Go for it. Do something. People are tired of waiting for
something to happen,'' she said. ``People are tired of hoping every
day for some news of a military strike.''
   The evacuees were taken from the airport to a hotel to wait for
the arrival of a charter that will fly them home. U.S. embassy
officials at the airport would not disclose plans for the flight to
the United States.
   A handful of Americans were evacuated by air from Kuwait last
week at the intervention of U.S. civil rights leader Jesse Jackson.
But most other Westerners leaving Kuwait have had to travel across
the desert in scorching summer heat to catch planes out Baghdad.
   Earlier today, a British Airways flight arrived in London
carrying 252 British women and children from Kuwait and Iraq. It
was the biggest group of Britons yet to leave the Iraqi capital,
Baghdad.
   There were an estimated 21,000 Westerners in Iraq and Kuwait
when Baghdad invaded Kuwait. They included 3,000 Americans.
   On Thursday, Baghdad said foreigners caught trying to leave
without permission could face life in prison.
   The State Department on Thursday blasted Iraq for its treatment
of foreign nationals, including the shooting of an American in
Kuwait who was trying to avoid capture. Department spokesman Mark
Dillen called Iraq's behavior ``outrageous.''
   ``We hold the Iraqi government responsible for the health and
welfare of all American citizens held against their will in Kuwait
and Iraq,'' Dillen said.

   The global effort against Iraq strengthened today with promises
of more aid for victims of the Persian Gulf crisis, and Kuwait's
exiled leaders joined the Saudis in pledging funds for U.S. forces
in the region.
   A planeload of 171 American women and children arrived in Amman,
Jordan, today aboard an Iraqi Airways jet, the first U.S.-chartered
airlift out of Kuwait. The arrivals described harrowing conditions
in the emirate.
   ``It's terrible there. People are frightended, they're in
hiding, running out of food,'' said Patricia Hammer of Denver, Colo.
   Moscow said it favored establishing a U.N. peacekeeping force in
the gulf and might have its troops participate in the effort to
rein in Iraq's Saddam Hussein, whose army overran Kuwait five weeks
ago and massed near the Saudi Arabian border.
   Three British minehunters made their way through Egypt's Suez
Canal today, heading for the Persian Gulf region, where scores of
U.S. and other warships are enforcing a U.N.-sanctioned embargo
against the Baghdad government.
   Despite the show of unity, some countries have begun suggesting
they might circumvent the U.N. sanctions. Today, India expressed
frustration that it had not been allowed to send food and medicine
to its nationals stranded in Iraq and Kuwait.
   ``It is inhuman to expect that political objectives will be
achieved through the process of starving people,'' said Indian
Foreign Ministry spokesman Aftab Seth.
   China's Foreign Ministry said Thursday it does not believe the
embargo applies to ``supplies intended strictly for medical
purposes and foodstuffs for humanitarian purposes.'' And Iran's
Tehran Times newspaper, which is close to President Hashemi
Rafsanjani, said in an editorial Thursday that sanctions aside,
providing food and medicine was a ``humanitarian question.''
   In Kuwait, conditions grew intolerable in embassies ordered by
the Iraqis to close two weeks ago. Norway said it would evacuate
its Kuwait mission on Saturday and that its three diplomats would
travel to Baghdad.
   A few embassies, including the U.S. mission, remained open, but
they were surrounded by Iraqi troops, with water, power and
telephone service cut off and food running out.
   Western women and children allowed out under Saddam's Aug. 28
promise they could go free were having an easier time getting home.
Western men are being held as human shields at Iraqi installations
to deter any attack by U.S-led multinational forces.
   In addition to the U.S.-chartered plane, a British Airways
flight arrived in London today carrying 252 British women and
children from Kuwait and Iraq. It was the biggest group of Britons
to leave Baghdad so far.
   There were an estimated 21,000 Westerners in Iraq and Kuwait
when Baghdad invaded and later annexed the neighboring emirate of
Kuwait. They included 3,000 Americans.
   More promises of aid were made today for desperate Asian and
Arab refugees from Iraq and Kuwait stranded in a no man's land at
the Jordanian border.
   Japan said it would pay an additional $12 million to help
evacuees. U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady also received
assurances from Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu in Tokyo
today that Japan would help pay the huge costs of the military
campaign in the Persian Gulf.
   South Korean President Roh Tae-woo made similar pledges to Brady
on the previous leg of his Asian tour.
   A day earlier, Britain earmarked $3.8 million more in refugee
aid, bringing total British aid to $10 million.
   Sweden today decided to contribute $5.2 million to help
repatriate refugees fleeing Iraq and Kuwait. The Swedish aid will
include food and medical assistance.
   European Community foreign ministers meeting in Rome today
agreed to give $2 billion in economic aid to Turkey, Jordan and
Egypt to compensate them for lost trade with Iraq. They also
granted more food and other emergency aid for the refugees from
Iraq and Kuwait stranded at Iraq's borders.
   The Jordanian news agency Petra says more than 600,000 people
have fled since Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2 in a dispute over oil,
land and money.
   Most have managed to leave Jordan, but relief officials said
more than 100,000 Bangladeshis, Pakistanis, Indians, Sri Lankans,
Thais and Filipinos remain in squalid camps that are running low on
food, water and medicines.
   Kuwait's exiled monarch, Jabir al-Sabah, told Secretary of State
James A. Baker III today his government will help pay for the U.S.
buildup in the gulf region ``in order to restore my country to what
it was before.''
   ``We will not spare any amount or any value. We will give
whatever is necessary,'' he told Baker at the royal mountain
retreat in Taif, Saudi Arabia, about 50 miles east of Mecca. The
emir did not immediately give a specific figure.
   U.S. officials say the cost of the 100,000-strong American force
in the region is about $1 billion a month.
   While Kuwait's royal family has lost control of its vast oil
reserves it still has billions in assets worldwide.
   In Saudi Arabia Thursday, Baker was promised that at a minimum,
the Saudi government will pick up all fuel, water and
transportation costs for American troops protecting the kingdom's
oil fields from possible Iraqi aggression.
   The aid has been estimated in the billions of dollars.
   On Thursday, members of a congressional delegation visiting U.S.
troops in Saudi Arabia said they were dissatisfied with the lack of
burden sharing and said international aid was essential to maintain
American public support.
   The delegation was scheduled to meet with Saudi King Fahd today.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov today said
Moscow would be willing to provide troops for a U.N. peacekeeping
force in the Persian Gulf if they were under a joint command that
included Soviet generals.
   U.S.-Soviet cooperation in the gulf crisis will be topic No. 1
on Sunday when Presidents Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev hold a
hastily arranged summit in Helsinki, Finland, spokesman for both
sides say.
   The Soviet announcement came a day after Iraq's foreign
minister, Tariq Aziz, told Gorbachev Iraq would not withdraw from
Kuwait. Moscow and Baghdad are longtime allies, but Gorbachev has
condemned the Kuwait invasion.
   There were, however, cautionary notes. In Tokyo, Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze urged U.S. troops not to take
unilateral action and said the superpower summit would seek ways to
resolve the Middle East crisis peacefully.
   In other diplomatic efforts, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar will send an envoy to occupied Kuwait to meet with
diplomats whose embassies are surrounded by Iraqi troops if he
receives Baghdad's permission.
   The United Nations has sent more than 3,000 tons of food and
supplies to Jordan and received $19 million in relief aid, mainly
from Japan and Sweden, said Robert Souria, a U.N. relief official.

<HEAD>Man Who Helped Wife Die Ordered To Stand Trial On Murder,
Conspiracy Charges</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROMULUS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A California man who said he came to
Michigan to help his dying wife commit suicide was ordered to stand
trial today on charges of murder and conspiracy to commit murder.
   Bertram Harper, 72, of Loomis, Calif., faces possible life
imprisonment if convicted of the Aug. 19 death of his wife
Virginia, 69.
   Romulus District Judge Henry Zaborowski, who presided over
Harper's two-day preliminary hearing, said he agreed with
prosecutors' claims that there was a conspiracy to end Mrs.
Harper's life.
   He also ordered Harper tried on the murder charge because no
evidence showed she consented to her death at the time Harper
pulled a plastic bag over her head and secured it around her neck.
   ``Suicide is self-destruction,'' Zaborowski said. ``There is no
law that gives a person a license to help another person in this
destruction.''
   Zaborowski allowed Harper to return to California, but scheduled
arraignment for Sept. 21 in Wayne County Circuit Court.
   The Hemlock Society, a suicide rights group, is paying for
Harper's defense.
   In his statement to Romulus police, Harper said his wife _
diagnosed with cancer of the breast and liver _ swallowed about a
dozen pills, washed them down with coffee liqueur and lay on their
motel-room bed while she pulled a clear plastic bag over her head.
   Afterward, Harper told reporters that he, his wife and
stepdaughter, Shanda McGrew, would not have come to Michigan if the
state had a law making it illegal to help someone else die.
   Wednesday's hearing included testimony from five witnesses. Four
of the five related accounts of Mrs. Harper's death given them by
McGrew, 40, who traveled with her mother and stepfather from
California to Michigan. Ms. McGrew is an unindicted co-conspirator
in her mother's death but has not been charged.
   Assisting in a suicide in California is a felony punishable by
up to five years' imprisonment. Michigan has no specific law
prohibiting people from assisted in suicides, but some prosecutors
have contended that the practice is still illegal in the state
under the general law against murder.
   Harper said their decision wasn't influenced by publicity over
the so-called ``suicide machine'' case involving Dr. Jack
Kevorkian, an outspoken advocate of death on demand for the
terminally ill.
   The suburban Detroit pathologist is under investigation but has
not been charged in the June 4 death of Janet Adkins, 54, of
Portland, Ore.
   Adkins was said to have had Alzheimer's disease when she and her
husband flew to Michigan, met Kevorkian and drove with him to a
park about 40 miles north of Detroit. There, Kevorkian fitted
Adkins with an intravenous tube and she pressed a button on a
machine he invented and it delivered a fatal dose of heart-stopping
drugs.

   Not one to tamper lightly with tradition,
the Farmers' Almanac suggests nonetheless that the date designated
for Thanksgiving is a turkey.
   In its 1991 edition, just off the presses, the venerable
publication says Americans should consider celebrating the holiday,
the fourth Thursday in November, earlier in the fall.
   An earlier date would rid Thanksgiving of pre-Christmas
overtones, allow for more favorable travel weather and line it up
more closely with the harvest whose bounty it is meant to
celebrate, the almanac says.
   The almanac says the second Monday in October, the date on which
Canada celebrates Thanksgiving, might be an appropriate
alternative. Almanac editor Ray Geiger invites readers to offer
their own ideas.
   ``We're only suggesting that we examine this thing. We're not
bold enough to say `do it!''' Geiger said in an interview.
   Thanksgiving, commemorating the feast held by members of the
Plymouth Colony in Massachusetts in December 1621 to celebrate that
year's harvest, has been observed at various dates over the years.
It has remained at its current date since 1863, except for a brief
period when President Franklin D. Roosevelt reset it for the third
Thursday in November.
   ``Thanksgiving is a sacred holiday. What makes it sacrosanct is
not that it is observed on a certain date each year, but rather
what it means,'' the almanac says. ``When one ponders the real
reason for Thanksgiving, the date of celebration seems immaterial.''
   Geiger said the principal reason for change would be to separate
Thanksgiving from the overlapping demands posed by the start of the
Christmas season.
   ``You've got football, you've got Christmas pressing and you
don't know whether you're celebrating Thanksgiving or Christmas,''
he said.
   An earlier holiday would reduce the chances that travelers would
encounter ice or snow while heading to family gatherings, Geiger
said. And it would shift the holiday to a time closer to the end of
the harvest, when the woods still are ablaze with colorful foliage,
he said.
   By contrast, fields and orchards are bare in late November and
trees have lost their leaves. ``When we celebrate Thanksgiving
under these conditions, we seem to have lost our sense of timing,''
the almanac said.
   The date change could mark the start of a new crusade by the
174-year-old almanac, which in years past has prodded the
government to restore city names to postmarks and eliminate the
nine-digit ZIP code.
   Geiger's almanac is not to be confused with the Old Farmers
Almanac, the 198-year-old New Hampshire-based publication. Geiger
claims a circulation of about 5 million for the 48-page
publication, sold to banks, insurance companies and other
businesses that distribute it to customers as a promotional tool.
   Last year's campaign promoting the introduction of a coin it
calls the Columbus Dollar as a replacement for the $1 bill is
making progress, Geiger said, and bills introduced in the House and
Senate are enjoying increased support.
   That proposal, along with the shuffling of Thanksgiving, does
not mean that the almanac is abandoning its longstanding profession
of traditional values.
   ``Tradition is a must for us, but we're not blinded by it,''
Geiger said.
   Almanac traditions include calendar data, puzzles, household
hints, inspirational messages, one-line jokes and ``flavorite
recipes.''
   Another tradition is weather data. This year's edition predicts
a harsh winter _ chilling news to households concerned about rising
energy prices brought on by the crisis in the Persian Gulf.
   ``It's going to be a rough winter, rougher than last year, with
more snow and more cold weather in January and February,'' Geiger
said.
   ``But it's not going to be a prolonged winter. It's going to
ease off early in March,'' Geiger said. The almanac forecasts a
mild spring and summer that won't be too hot.
   The forecasts are prepared by Caleb Weatherbee, who calculates
them in accordance with a secret formula based on sunspots, the
position of the planets and the tidal action of the moon, Geiger
said.
   ``His track record has been excellent, getting better every
year.''

   The nations of the European Community today agreed
to give $2 billion in economic aid to Turkey, Jordan and Egypt to
compensate them for trade lost as a result of the U.N. sanctions on
Iraq.
   The European countries also granted more food and other
emergency aid for the tens of thousands of refugees from Iraq and
Kuwait stranded at Iraq's borders.
   However, the 12 EC states made no promises to contribute to the
cost of deploying U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf. The buildup was
launched to counter the Iraqi invasion of neighboring Kuwait on
Aug. 2.
   After the meeting of the EC foreign ministers, the Italian
minister, Gianni De Michelis, told reporters, ``We want to
contribute to the burden-sharing in an independent and direct
manner and not to the expenses of a separate country, even though
it is an ally.''
   He said the $2 billion that the EC will grant Turkey, Jordan and
Egypt through 1991 ``relieves the United States of an effort in
this area.'' There have been increasing demands in the U.S.
Congress for America's allies to share the cost of deploying the
thousands of U.S. troops in the gulf.
   Italy holds the EC's rotating presidency.
   Jordan, Turkey and Egypt are particularly hard hit by the
U.N.-ordered embargo on Iraq. The EC executive Commission has
estimated their losses in revenues through 1991 at roughly $10
billion.
   On food and other emergency aid for refugees, the EC countries
agreed to donate another $39 million. That money would come in
addition to the $27 million they already pledged.
   The European Community members are France, West Germany, Italy,
Luxembourg, Belgium, Netherlands, Denmark, Greece, Ireland,
Portugal, Spain, and Britain.

   A hyena that accidentally locked
itself in the bathroom at a game park got the last laugh _ it tore
the room apart and opened the shower tap, flooding the house.
   The Star newspaper said Friday the hyena spent 24 hours in the
bathroom last weekend at the house in Skukuza, a village in Kruger
National Park in eastern South Africa. It apparently wandered into
the house while the occupants were away.
   The hyena pulled down curtains, ripped the medicine chest from
the wall, smashed the toilet seat, damaged a towel rail and bit
into aerosal shaving cream and deodorant cans, the Star said.
   It also turned on the shower, causing overflowing water to seep
under the door into the rest of the house, the newspaper said.
   Neighbors saw water coming out from under the front door and
alerted game rangers, who shot the hyena with a tranquilizer dart
through the bathroom window. Tests on the animal indicated no
serious injuries, and the hyena was released.

   The crisis in the Persian Gulf could be
settled peacefully if Iraqi President Saddam Hussein got his teeth
fixed, the personal dentist to the late guru Osho Rajneesh said
Friday.
   Swami Devageet said Rajneesh, the mystic who was expelled from
the United States in 1985 and died in January, discovered a year
ago that ``man's animal past, including his aggressive instincts,
are mysteriously stored in the human dental structure.''
   In a telex from the commune that Rajneesh founded in Poona,
Devageet said Saddam could become ``a blissful human being instead
of a blistering warmonger'' if he submitted to tooth-centered
character analysis.
   ``It may sound absurd, but it's a lot cheaper than a third World
War,'' Devageet said.

<HEAD>Teen Sentenced to Five Years For Hijacking</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A teen-ager who hijacked an Aeroflot jet to Sweden
in June has been convicted of air piracy and sentenced to five
years in prison, Soviet media reported.
   Dmitry Semenov, 17, pretended he had a grenade and forced the
Minsk-to-Murmansk flight to land in Stockholm on June 9. He told
authorities he hijacked the jet for personal rather than political
reasons.
   Airline hijackings carry a penalty of 5 to 20 years in jail in
the Soviet Union, but because he is under 18, Semenov faced a
maximum of 10 years.
   Prosecutor Ivan Sukhoverkh asked the judges at the trial in
Minsk to sentence Semenov to six years, and on Thursday they
sentenced him to five, the Tass news agency reported.
   The judges took into account the fact that Semenov came from a
broken home and noted his ``high emotional excitability,'' Tass
said.
   There were at least a dozen airline hijackings in the Soviet
Union this summer.
   The youth will serve his sentence in a reformatory for juvenile
delinquents, Tass said.
   Semenov was believed to be the first person to be extradited
from Sweden to the Soviet Union since the end of World War II, when
some Baltic refugees were sent back. The Soviet Union alleged they
were Nazi sympathizers.
   Sweden's acting prime minister, Lena Hjelm-Wallen, said the
decision to grant the extradition request was ``a signal to
would-be hijackers.''

<HEAD>Nudist Camp Owner Challenges GOP Incumbent; Three-Way Democratic
Primary</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Three New Hampshire Democrats are trying to
turn the state's financial woes into a political plus as they seek
to end eight years of Republican domination in the governor's
office.
   Gov. Judd Gregg faces token opposition from a nudist camp owner
in Tuesday's primary.
   The three Democrats fighting for the chance to run against Gregg
are counting on voter unrest to sway independents, who comprise
just under one-third of registered voters, to vote Democratic in
November.
   New Hampshire has a dismal economy and a budget deficit despite
recent tax hikes. But most believe it will be an uphill climb for
any Democrat to unseat Gregg.
   The governor already has more than twice the campaign
contributions his opponents have raised collectively and leads
comfortably in polls.
   Gregg, 43, a former four-term congressman, is seeking his second
two-year term. In the GOP primary, he faces Robert Bonser, 69, who
decided to run to protest having several mobile homes hauled out of
his nudist park in a zoning dispute.
   Former state Democratic Chairman Joseph Grandmaison, 47, state
Senate Democratic Leader Robert Preston, 61, and state Rep. Paul
Blacketor, 63, have focused their campaigns for the Democratic
nomination on Gregg, accusing him of mismanaging the economy.
   Grandmaison says Gregg's ``short-term fixes'' will result in a
``giant past due bill arriving next January.''
   Adds Preston: ``I have never seen such chaos in state
government. Our economy is floundering; the ship of state lacks a
skipper at the helm.''
   Gregg and legislators enacted a package of tax and fee hikes and
spending cuts in February that weren't enough to prevent a deficit
when the fiscal year ended June 30. A further decline in revenues
prompted Gregg last month to make additional budget cuts.
   Gregg says he's acted decisively and that the $160 million fix
in February means ``the budget concerns we now face are
manageable.''
   Preston and Blacketor also have attacked Grandmaison, who leads
them in recent polls, as being too closely tied to Gov. Michael
Dukakis of Massachusetts, whose popularity has plunged since he ran
for president.
   Grandmaison directed Dukakis' first gubernatorial campaign and
has received contributions from more than 40 current or former
Dukakis campaign workers as well as $100 from Dukakis.
   Preston, who says he represents a conservative wing of the party
able to win in November, wants voters to link Grandmaison with
Massachusetts, derisively called ``Taxachusetts'' by some New
Hampshire residents.
   ``Frankly, I think Granite State citizens will resent the fact
that Massachusetts politicians and their fat cat contributors will
try and influence the outcome of a New Hampshire election,''
Preston says.
   ``Mike Dukakis is my friend. He gave my campaign $100,''
Grandmaison responds. ``I don't know why Bob (Preston) finds that
so upsetting.''
   Abortion is an important, but not pivotal, issue, partly because
Gregg vetoed pro-choice legislation both this year and last.
   Preston and Bonser oppose abortion while Grandmaison and
Blacketor are pro-choice. The National Abortion Rights Action
League of New Hampshire endorsed Grandmaison, believing he has a
better chance of winning than Blacketor.
   However, taxes overshadowed abortion in a poll of 900 potential
voters in July by the Becker Institute Inc. of Sudbury, Mass.
   New Hampshire voters traditionally reject candidates who refuse
to take ``The Pledge'' to veto general sales or income tax
proposals. But both Grandmaison and Blacketor advocate tax reform,
which has growing appeal to voters disenchanted that property taxes
have doubled, on average, since 1983.
   Blacketor proposes an income tax earmarked for property tax
relief, while Grandmaison has called for tax reform without being
specific.
   Gregg has promised to veto broad-based taxes.
   In the Becker poll, Gregg topped Grandmaison among pro-choice
voters, 47 percent to 37 percent, with 16 percent undecided.
Grandmaison led Gregg among those who favor enacting a state sales
or income tax, 45 percent to 38 percent, with 17 percent undecided.
   Gregg held a wide lead over Grandmaison among tax- and
abortion-opponents, and among those satisfied with the economy.
   Overall, 52 percent picked Gregg to 32 percent for Grandmaison
with 16 percent undecided. Gregg led Preston by a similar margin.
The margin of error was about 5 percentage points.
   An August poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire for
WMUR-TV had Grandmaison leading his opponents almost 3-1, but more
than half of those polled said they hadn't made up their minds.

   The last large deployment of U.S.
Marines in the Middle East ended with more than 240 of them killed
by a suicide car bomber in Beirut in 1983.
   Risks of such an attack are extremely low in a controlled
society like Saudi Arabia, but the U.S. military says it is taking
no chances.
   ``The lesson we learned from Beirut was a very hard one,'' said
spokesman Lt. Col. John Olsen. ``We're taking a lot of care not to
repeat that.''
   He would not comment on specific security measures, but some are
obvious. Journalists are barred from photographing sleeping areas,
for example.
   The suicide bomber in Lebanon's capital, believed to be a member
of an extremist Shiite Moslem faction, drove a truck crammed with
explosives into a Marines barracks building.
   Commanders were criticized for inadequate precautions that
allowed the truck driver to make it through the gates.
   Marines in Saudi Arabia said Beirut crosses their minds
occasionally.
   ``You always think nothing's going to happen, but you never
know,'' said Sgt. Thomas Hixson, 23, of Kingston, Tenn. ``Just like
Beirut. It helps keep people's morale up to ask them what they
would do in a case like that.''
   The 2nd Battalion's commanding officer was more blunt.
   ``We're not going to allow terrorists to come in here and kill
Marines,'' said Col. Carl Fulford, of Twentynine Palms, Calif.
``We're not going to stack them up in one hotel waiting for someone
to come blow them up.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Blunt talk by commanders makes good newspaper quotes and
excellent television or radio sound bites. The more it sounds like
the movies, the faster reporters try to get every nugget.
   Fulford is a particular favorite for sentences like: ``If the
Iraqi were to come south, we'd give him all he can handle.''
   Said one Australian reporter after a Fulford briefing: ``They
got that guy from central casting.''

   U.S. troops headed into the Saudi Arabian desert are given
strict lectures about Islamic customs that demand fairly
puritanical behavior by American standards, such as the separation
of men and women in public.
   A song booming over the loudspeaker on a bus shuttling around
one staging area seemed inappropriate. The refrain was: ``Take Me
Dancing Naked in The Rain.''

   The new diplomatic quarter in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, is a
stunning enclave of parks and embassies executed by modern
architects. The shopping centers and apartment buildings were
designed to resemble old Saudi mud brick forts.
   The landscaped park around the quarter consists basically of a
high earthern wall with just a few entrances cut through for roads.
   The idea was to allow up to 25,000 foreigners living there some
privacy for outdoor activities like jogging that the Saudi public
might frown on.
   But in this time of crisis, the Iraqi siege of the foreign
embassies in Kuwait is more on everbody's mind than the careful
design.
   ``They'll have no difficulty sealing off this quarter,'' joked
one visitor.

   The question: ``What should be done about Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein?'' elicits a standard array of responses like ``Hit him
hard'' or ``Knock him down'' or just plain ``Kill him!''
   But once in a while the question draws a more vivid answer.
   Like one from an elderly Omani herdsman: ``I'd like to take out
his eyes and heart and boil them.''

<HEAD>White House Panel on Owls Unlikely to Change Endangered Species
Act</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT SONNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Faced with opposition from environmentalists
and key lawmakers, the Bush administration isn't likely to weaken
the Endangered Species Act to save logging jobs in Northwest
forests where the threatened northern spotted owl lives,
congressional aides said Friday.
   Bill Calder, press secretary for Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore.,
said a White House task force hasn't ruled out changing the act to
soften the economic blow of protecting the owl. But, he said,
leaders of the Cabinet-level task force have indicated they're
moving away from that option.
   ``The senator has always believed we should not be tinkering
with the act,'' Calder said.
   An aide to Rep. Bob Smith, R-Ore., also said Friday it appears
unlikely there is enough support in Congress to change the act.
   ``There are too many powerful committee chairmen, subcommittee
chairman, indeed the rank-and-file members, who say they are not
going to change the act,'' said press secretary Dave Redmond.
   Hatfield and Assistant Agriculture Secretary Jim Moseley, who
works on the task force for Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter,
denied reports the panel backs a version of a controversial plan
offered by government scientists in April. That plan would ban
logging on millions of old-growth forests in Washington, Oregon and
Northern California.
   ``It's not the information we have received,'' Hatfield said.
   Moseley said in a statement that the task force has not
completed its deliberations. He said reports that the task force
has concluded owl protection will cost 20,000 jobs are
``speculative and conjectural.''
   ``The task force is working toward recommendations which will
balance the economic and environmental concerns of the Northwest,''
Moseley said.
   Hatfield said the recommendations made by the scientific
committee are ``totally unacceptable.'' Job loss in the region
under that proposal would range from 25,000 to 50,000 and revenue
loss could total $600 million to $2 billion, he said.
   ``I can tell you that would be like sending a missile into the
economy of the Northwest,'' Hatfield said.
   Steve Goldstein, a spokesman for Interior Secretary Manuel
Lujan, denied a report in Friday's Washington Post that the task
force had tentatively agreed to back the April report.
   Lujan is a member of the task force, along with the heads of the
Environmental Protection Agency, the Office of Management and
Budget and the Council of Economic Advisers.
   Goldstein said late Thursday that the task force leaders told
the panel's working members this week ``to begin exploring new
options.''
   ``Clearly the principals are not satisfied that they have come
up with the best solution,'' Goldstein said. ``Secretary Lujan
believes there are better options.''
   Goldstein declined to elaborate on those options.
   A congressional aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity
said White House Chief of Staff John Sununu told Yeutter on
Wednesday that the April report is ``simply unacceptable'' because
of its economic impact.
   An administration source who asked not to be identified said the
task force had concluded it will be more difficult to save timber
jobs than the task force originally had hoped, but that no plan has
been backed.
   The Fish and Wildlife Service declared the owl a threatened
species in June.

   Officials at Will Rogers World Airport
would like to know how a parrot got in with a flock of ducks living
at a pond on airport property.
   But the bird isn't talking.
   Airport spokesman Tom Morton said field maintenance workers
first noticed the gaudy green bird Aug. 31 and called animal
control. But animal control officers were unable to catch it.
   A call to the Oklahoma City Zoo also proved worthless. ``They
didn't want the parrot,'' Morton said.
   Morton and a photographer went looking and found the bird
perched in a tree.
   ``We couldn't coax him down, but he didn't seem to mind our
taking his picture,'' Morton said.
   The bird is not wanting for company in the grassy area known as
Coleman Plaza at the airport entrance.
   ``There are rabbits, ducks, doves, raccoons and other animals
living there,'' Morton said.
   He said the parrot has taken up with the ducks, apparently
because the fowl get fed regularly.

<HEAD>Advice to GOP: Call Democrats `Sick,' `Pathetic,' `Liberal'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attention Republicans: mention ``strength,''
``vision'' and ``hard work'' when talking about yourself. Use
``pathetic,'' ``liberal'' and ``criminal rights'' when talking
about Democrats.
   GOPAC, a conservative political action committee, this week is
distributing scores of suggested words and phrases that can help
GOP candidates burnish their own images and revile their opponents.
   The Washington-based group, whose general chairman is Rep. Newt
Gingrich of Georgia, sent the list and a few helpful hints to some
6,000 Republican officeholders and candidates across the country.
   Gingrich is not one to ignore his own advice.
   In an August speech to the Heritage Foundation, Gingrich packed
four words from the GOPAC list into just two sentences. The loaded
words are indicated in capital letters:
   ``Congress is a broken system. It is increasingly a system of
CORRUPTION in which money politics is defeating and driving out
CITIZEN politics. Congress is a SICKer and sicker institution in an
imperial capital that wallows in the American people's TAX money.''
   Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Ginny Terzano used few
words in responding to the GOPAC circular.
   ``While the Democrats are dealing with issues, Republicans are
playing Scrabble,'' she said.
   The recipients of the GOP list aren't yet running for Congress.
But GOPAC hopes they will.
   ``This list is prepared so that you might have a directory of
words to use in writing literature and mail, in preparing speeches,
and in producing electronic media,'' GOPAC tells its members in
introducing the key words.
   ``The words and phrases are powerful. Read them. Memorize as
many as possible. And remember that, like any tool, these words
will not help if they are not used.''
   In all, there are 131 selections to choose from. Half are called
``positive governing words'' that candidates can use to outline
their vision of the future and of their own philosophy. They
include ``flag,'' ``prosperity,'' ``common sense,'' and ``reform.''
   The others are called ``contrasting words'' that attempt to
identify and label the Democratic enemy in terms voters can
understand. They include ``waste,'' ``corruption,'' ``traitor,''
and ``decay.''
   GOPAC offers a whole host of ``anti-'' words handy for use
against opponents _ ``anti-flag,'' ``anti-family,'' ``anti-child,''
``anti-jobs.''
   The word list is the product of months of research by GOPAC
staffers in focus groups across the country, according to Gingrich.
   GOPAC Chairman Howard ``Bo'' Callaway said the group hopes the
vocabulary list, instructional speaking tapes, forums and other
programs it offers will help correct a flaw in the political
system. Conservatism, he said, is popular, but that isn't being
reflected in the results of local elections. Sometimes
conservatives lose because they don't use the right buzz words.
   ``Language really does matter _ how you say things and the
semantics,'' Callaway said.

<TEXT>
   Two utilities have agreed to develop a
mass-production electric car and put 1,000 of them on the streets
of the nation's smoggiest city by late 1992.
   The $7 million project would produce as many as 10,000 electric
vehicles for car-crazy Los Angeles by 1995, the city Department of
Water and Power and Southern California Edison Co. announced
Thursday.
   ``It is essential that we move ahead on clean air,'' said City
Councilman Marvin Braude, an advocate of electric car development.
``We must find alternative fuels to oil _ and electric power is the
fuel of choice.''
   The car will be designed by Clean Air Transport, a 2-year-old
firm based in Sweden that beat 18 American and foreign bidders for
the contract.
   Dubbed the ``LA 301,'' the clean machine would carry four
passengers, have a range of 150 miles between charges and a top
speed of 70 mph. Designers say it will accelerate from zero to 30
mph in nine seconds.
   In passenger sedan and quarter-ton minivan models, the vehicles
initially would cost $25,000 each, a price officials said would
drop with large scale production.
   ``They're fun to ride. It's exciting and they are
vibrationless,'' Braude said after test driving a prototype.
   The first cars will be produced in England. Henry Munkevik,
managing director of Clean Air Transport, said production
eventually could be transferred to Los Angeles.
   Jerry Enzenauer, the DWP's electric transportation program
manager, acknowledged the utilities hoped the plan would help
persuade air quality officials to ease pollution restrictions on
power plants.

<HEAD>Report Says Louisiana Oil Field Waste Contaminating Wetlands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toxic and radioactive discharges from
oil fields are contaminating southeast Louisiana wetlands, possibly
upsetting the delicate ecological balance and disrupting the food
chain, says a state report.
   The Department of Environmental Quality study released Thursday
said high levels of volatile organic compounds and radium are
accumulating in estuaries and wetland sediment.
   The contamination could spread if the sediment was disburbed by
dredging, a storm or even a passing tugboat, state officials said.
And the pollutants threaten to diminish the seafood supply, they
said.
   ``The more land we lose to coastal erosion, the less we have
left and the more we have to protect it,'' said Maureen O'Neill,
assistant secretary of the department. ``There's a very serious
amount of contamination going into the wetlands through these
discharges and we have to get rid of it.''
   The sediment is being contaminated by ``produced water,'' a
virtual chemical stew that flows from oil wells.
   Companies separate the produced water from petroleum and release
it into the wetlands. Such discharges, amounting to 84 million
gallons a day, are allowed in southeastern Louisiana but are
prohibited in the northern part of the state, O'Neill said. Only
Texas and Louisiana allow the discharge of produced water, the
department said.
   The report appears to add momentum to the campaign to ban such
discharges. The department has circulated proposed regulations to
phase out the discharge of produced water in four years. Oil and
gas companies have complained that the deadline is too short;
environmentalists have objected that it is too long, O'Neill said.
   Industry could drill new wells and inject the contaminants into
them, but that's much more expensive than dumping them into the
water.
   ``It's always cheaper to release contaminants into the
waterways,'' said O'Neill said. ``But this won't put the oil
industry out of business.''
   Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association, the lobbying organization
for the state's oil and gas companies, said in 40 years of
drilling, produced water has not harmed the environment or human
health. The threat has been limited to some bottom-dwelling
organisms in certain wetlands, said spokesman Larry Wall.
   He said a ban on such discharges could force the capping of less
profitable wells. The association has asked for eight years to end
the discharges.

<HEAD>Island Dispute Still Hampers Improved Relations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's planned visit
to Japan is another step to ease tensions between the nations, but
rival claims over an island chain keep relations cool, officials
said Friday following four days of meetings.
   It was unclear if the talks made progress toward resolving the
45-year-old territorial dispute over the islands seized by the
Soviets at the end of World War II. The issue has blocked closer
relations with the Soviet Union while many other nations break down
Cold War barriers with Moscow.
   ``One thing I can confidently say is that the ... atmosphere has
changed significantly during this visit,'' said Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze before returning to Moscow Friday.
   ``It was an extremely meaningful visit for both sides,'' said
Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama.
   The agreement for the April 1991 visit by Gorbachev highlighted
the meetings between Nakayama and Shevardnadze.
   Japanese officials, however, stressed they will continue to push
for the return of the Kuril Islands, a sparsely populated
archipelago north of the Japanese island of Hokkaido.
   The islands, in waters rich with salmon and other marine
resources, were claimed as historically Russian territory. Japan
contends they were ceded by a 19th-century agreement.
   The two countries have yet to sign a post-World War II peace
treaty because of the Kuril dispute.
   ``I could not find any practical change in the attitude of the
Soviet Union on the territorial issue,'' Nakayama said.
   But some analysts say they expect the Soviets to seek a
resolution to the territorial issue in order to gain access to
Japanese economic aid and investment.
   ``I think the time is ripe to take a big political step forward.
It is time to discuss fundamental issues between the two
countries,'' said Shevardnadze.
   ``Our basic policy remains unchanged,'' said Kazuhiko Togo,
director of the Foreign Ministry's Soviet Union Division. ``We have
asked the Soviet side to consider the question seriously, squarely
and straightforwardly.''
   It is not clear whether Japanese officials will discuss the
Kuril dispute with Gorbachev, who earlier threatened to refuse a
Japanese trip if the issue would be raised.
   Shevardnadze also met with Emperor Akihito and invited him to
Moscow.
   Akihito declined to reply immediately, saying ``it is for the
two governments to decide,'' according to an Imperial Household
Agency official.
   On Wednesday, the two governments issued their first joint
statement on an international issue. The declaration condemned the
Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and demanded an immediate
withdrawal of its troops.

<TEXT>
   The government of President
Carlos Menem, signaling it will not bow to pressure by organized
labor, has sent soldiers to the state telephone company to replace
striking employees.
   It was the harshest action yet by the government against the
unions that helped put it in office 14 months ago. A crew of about
20 officials from the army, navy and air force went to work
Thursday at the telephone company's center for international
communications in downtown Buenos Aires.
   The director of the state company, ENTel, said it was necessary
to protect company property and restore service after 350 strikers
were fired. The boycott by the 25,000 union members in the capital
threatened to spread nationwide.
   ``The jobs not covered by normal operators ... are going to be
covered, as of today, by personnel of the armed forces,'' Maria
Julia Alsogaray told reporters after meeting with Menem.
   The Menem government has been plagued by strikes in recent
months, many brought on by salary demands as real wages have been
shrunk by inflation.
   Bus drivers walked off the job Monday just before the evening
rush hour. The next day, 40,000 doctors and nurses at public
hospitals stayed off the job to protest the layoffs of 2,000
colleagues. Most were rehired.
   Train crews were to strike beginning Thursday, but the
government ordered mandatory conciliation for 20 days. University
professors have not given end-of-semester exams since July; grade
school teachers are threatening to revive classroom boycotts held
months ago.
   The government claims some of the strikes are political
statements against its policies of budget austerity and a reduced
role for the state in the economy.
   Unions that represent ENTel and state airline employees admit
they fear job and wage cutbacks when the companies are sold. Formal
transfers of ownership are set for Oct. 8.
   Privatizations and deregulation as well as budget austerity have
been policy centerpieces since Menem took office in July 1989 amid
hyperinflation, recession and a nearly bankrupt treasury.
   He lifted controls on foreign exchange and prices, allowed
foreign companies access to state oil fields, reduced import
tariffs and export taxes, cut back subsidies to private businesses
and provincial governments, seized bank deposits to throttle
speculation, and hiked public service rates to what it costs to
provide them.
   Midway through this year, monthly inflation neared single
digits, Central Bank reserves topped $2.3 billion, and the austral
regained stability.
   However, inflation in July crept up to 10.8 percent and last
month reached 15.3 percent. The austral began to devalue.
   Menem's response was to announce the layoffs of 130,000 contract
employees and civil servants, close down the money-losing National
Mortgage Bank, and pay state suppliers owed $8 billion with bonds
that come due over 10 years.
   ``The party's over,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Tourism officials hope a train ride
following the route of Glenn Miller's ``Chattanooga Choo-Choo''
will boost recognition for the city that inspired the tune.
   The Chattanooga Convention and Visitors Bureau is planning a
special rail excursion from New York to Chattanooga next September
on what will be the song's 50th anniversary.
   Bureau officials plan to use the 18-car train to bring about 400
convention planners, travel writers, tour operators and business
executives to Chattanooga.
   ``It's not just a train ride. It'll have lasting impact. Someone
may book a meeting three years down the road as a result of taking
this trip,'' Carl Little, executive director of the bureau, said
Thursday.
   If all goes as planned, the train will arrive in Chattanooga in
time for the city's annual Choo-Choo festival.
   Harry Warren and Mack Gordon wrote the song ``Chattanooga
Choo-Choo,'' about a fictional New York-to-Chattanooga rail route.
It made its debut in the 1941 movie ``Sun Valley Serenade'' and won
a gold record for Miller.
   ``We're known worldwide for that song,'' said Little. ``I've
traveled quite a few places, and in most parts they don't even know
that Chattanooga's in Tennessee. But they know the Chattanooga
Choo-Choo.''
   The tourism bureau is still working out details with Amtrak, but
the train is expected to leave from New York's Pennsylvania
Station, just as in the song, Little said.
   ``I don't know that we'll leave right at a quarter of four,
because that's the time the Crescent leaves,'' Little said,
chuckling. ``But we will make promotional stops in Philadelphia,
Baltimore, Washington, Lynchburg, Virginia, Charlottesville,
Virginia, Charlotte, North Carolina, and Atlanta.''

   A North Korean soldier on a sea
training exercise broke away from his unit Friday and used a rubber
boat to defect to South Korea, military officials said.
   Lee Kyong Nam, 24, a master sergeant, surrendered to a South
Korean military outpost on Paeknyongdo Island shortly after 2 p.m.,
the officials said. The island, 120 miles northwest of Seoul, is
only six miles from the North Korean coast.
   The defection came a few hours after North Korean Premier Yon
Hyong Muk returned home following after four days of historic talks
with South Korea on easing tensions between the rival states.
   Several North Korean soldiers and civilians have defected to
South Korea by sea and land in recent years.
   The Korean peninsula was divided into the communist North and
the capitalist South in 1945. Their border is the most heavily
armed in the world with more than 1.6 million troops deployed on
both sides.

   Jesse Jackson is campaigning to become the
District of Columbia's unpaid ``shadow senator'' using the same
personal salesmanship skills that earned him 7 million votes for
president in 1988.
   Jackson is favored to win one of two ``shadow senator''
nominations in Tuesday's Democratic primary after spending months
preaching the gospel of statehood for the district.
   The two ``senators'' will serve as lobbyists pressing Congress
for D.C. statehood. District voters also will elect a ``shadow
representative'' this year to advance the district's uphill effort
to become a state.
   It is Jackson's first bid for an office other than president,
and he is using the same articulate, personal campaign style that
he employed in his 1984 and 1988 presidential campaigns.
   While four years ago he was stumping in Iowa wheat fields and
East Los Angeles soup kitchens, Jackson now works coffee klatches
and neighborhood meetings around the nation's capital.
   ``Jackson in person is very persuasive _ in that sense it is the
same as his presidential campaigns,'' said longtime Jackson aide
Frank Watkins.
   ``Statehood was dead, buried and had a couple shovel loads of
earth on it when he started talking about it, and now, all the
mayoral candidates say it is one of their top priorities.''
   If Jackson wins one of the ``senator'' nominations on Tuesday, a
victory in November's general election is a near-certainty, given
that Democrats outnumber Republicans by an eight-to-one margin in
the district.
   Jackson moved from Chicago to Washington last year, and
speculation that he would run for mayor increased with Mayor Marion
Barry's much-publicized legal problems linked to drug and perjury
charges. Barry, who was convicted of a misdemeanor cocaine
possession charge, decided not to seek re-election.
   But Jackson declined to run for mayor, prompting a new round of
criticism from those who have maintained he is unqualified to be
president because he never has served in elective office.
   Jackson says he chose to seek the shadow senator's job because
``my quest is not employment. It's empowerment.''
   ``Why D.C. statehood? Why not mayor? Because my life commitment
is to expand democracy,'' he told a group of Democratic women this
summer.
   Some critics have faulted Jackson for a weak understanding of
local issues, and questioned whether the world traveller will
commit himself fully to the goal of statehood.
   ``Freeing D.C. residents from colonial bondage will require more
commitment than his three-day rescue mission to Damascus or
Baghdad,'' the local ``City Paper'' said in a recent article on
Jackson's campaign.
   Aides say statehood remains Jackson's top priority even as he
continues to be involved in a host of foreign policy and civil
rights issues.
   Last week he traveled to the Middle East, where he interviewed
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein for a syndicated television show. A
week earlier, he stood before microphones and television cameras to
urge minorities to boycott Nike products because the athletic wear
giant has no blacks on its board of directors.
   ``The commitment is there,'' said Bernard Demczuk, a labor
liaison with Jackson's National Rainbow Coalition. ``Whether it is
(in) the Middle East or Mississippi, he is saying that the number
one civil rights priority is statehood for the district.''
   ``Don't forget, he can travel the country, getting the people
who voted for him (in 1988) to pressure their elected
representatives to support statehood,'' Watkins said.
   The shadow senator concept first was employed by the Tennessee
territory prior to its admission to the union in 1796.
   The district's shadow delegation will have no voting rights and
only one official mission _ to encourage Congress to make the
nation's capital the 51st state. The city council originally wanted
to spend $1.3 million for the delegation's salaries and expenses,
but dropped that plan because of budget problems.
   The lack of voting authority and a salary hasn't diminished
Jackson's enthusiasm for statehood _ or his penchant for relentless
campaigning.
   ``He's been to forums, ward events, quite a few house parties,
just like last time around,'' Watkins said. ``The only difference
here is, the travel is a lot easier _ any stop we have to make here
can be done in 20 minutes or less, without getting on a plane.''

<HEAD>Summit Could Lead to Joint Statement on Iraq, Maybe More</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   For President Bush, the Helsinki summit offers
a chance to demonstrate truly global support for his Persian Gulf
policy. For Mikhail Gorbachev, it presents an opportunity to remind
his people the Soviet Union remains a major player in world affairs.
   As for specific actions, there are a number of possible steps
Bush and Gorbachev could take to signal united disapproval of
Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait.
   Administration officials sought to lower expectations for any
major initiatives from either side.
   But, even a joint statement reiterating the call for an Iraqi
rollback from Kuwait would be significant. It would mark the first
time the Cold War rivals have spoken in tandem on a major
international issue other than arms control in more than four
decades _ a strong message U.S. officials say they assume would not
be lost on Saddam.
   The two leaders will also use their Sunday summit to attempt to
prod arms-control negotiations in hopes of nailing down a treaty on
conventional force reductions in Europe by year's end,
administration officials say.
   And they could announce at summit's end whether they will accept
invitations to attend German reunification ceremonies in Berlin on
Oct. 3.
   The White House expectation-lowering effort followed a familiar
pattern in advance of superpower summits.
   ``As the president has indicated, it is an unstructured
agenda,'' said presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Still, at last December's summit at Malta, the White House said
essentially the same thing _ and Bush proceeded to lay out in
careful detail a full 16-point program.
   Here are some steps that could be taken at Helsinki if the
leaders decide to go beyond a simple statement on Iraq.
   _ Although it seems unlikely, Moscow could agree to send forces
to bolster the U.N. military operation. A senior administration
official, briefing reporters at the White House on Friday on the
condition of anonymity, said it would ``be useful if the Soviets
would send ground forces.'' Bush seems likely to convey this
message to the Soviet leader at Sunday's session.
   _ Gorbachev could announce the withdrawal of all or some Soviet
advisers from Iraq, as pressed by the United States. However, such
a step would mark a major concession on the Soviet side _ and U.S.
official say they do not really except it to happen. Still, ``you
can be sure the issue will be discussed,'' the senior official said.
   _ The Soviet Union could agree to develop, with outside help,
its vast oil supplies to help offset losses from the gulf.
Fitzwater said energy supplies will be discussed ``and probably oil
reserves in the Soviet Union.'' However, Soviet oil production has
been down in recent months.
   _ Some long range peace plan for the region could be proposed,
or at least an agreement to study the possibility.
   It would have to be a common ground between the NATO-like
military alliance proposed by Secretary of State James A. Baker III
and the conference suggested by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze to settle both the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait and the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
   _ The Soviets could be invited to play some mediation role in
negotiating the withdrawal of Iraq from occupied Kuwait and U.S.
forces from Saudi Arabia. U.S. officials have played down these
suggestions, however.
   The summit will give a Bush a chance to respond to Soviet
misgivings about the U.S. military buildup less than 1,000 miles
from the Soviet border. Gorbachev has said ``the building up of
military confrontation might lead to unpredictable consequences''
in the tense Persian Gulf.
   Also, if Bush is planning military action against Iraq, he would
no doubt want to tell Gorbachev of his intentions in advance, U.S.
officials agree.
   Lost in the discussions, says one administration official
involved in the summit preparations, is the fact that ``there is
obviously a special relationship that the Soviet Union enjoys with
Iraq.''
   Moscow had been Baghdad's prime arms supplier. The Soviets
``still have their advisers there. They still have influence,'' the
official said.
   ``The fact of the (Helsinki) meeting itself sends a very strong
signal to Saddam,'' the official said.
   Thus far, despite its lukewarm support for the U.S. military
presence in the Middle East, the Soviet Union has tolerated it.
   The summit will also give Bush a chance to sound out Gorbachev
on ``what the Iraq position is,'' particularly in light of this
week's meeting between the Soviet leader and the Iraqi foreign
minister, the official said.
   ``We will pass on what our intentions are and our goals are,''
the official added.
   Many analysts say they doubt that any new initiatives will
result from the summit _ if only because all sides seem to want to
wait to see if the international sanctions are taking hold.

   Investigators found ``promising
evidence'' in the slayings of five college students when they
searched the lodgings and car of a suspect, a spokeswoman said
today.
   On Thursday, investigators searched the apartment of the
suspect, 18-year-old part-time student Edward Lewis Humphrey, as
well as the home of his grandmother and his car. They also took
blood and hair samples from Humphrey.
   ``We did not leave empty-handed,'' Lt. Sadie Darnell,
Gainesville police spokeswoman, told a news briefing today.
   Besides calling the evidence promising, she declined to
elaborate. On Thursday, she had said that while she was not
prepared to label Humphrey a prime suspect, ``it is obvious we have
a lot of information on Mr. Humphrey.''
   Humphrey, whom police describe as one of eight suspects in last
month's grisly slayings, has not been charged in the deaths.
   He remained jailed today on $1 million bond in connection with
an assault on his grandmother shortly after the killings. And
Thursday, University of Florida police announced they issued a
warrant charging Humphrey with two counts of aggravated assault in
another incident Aug. 25, a day before the first two bodies were
found.
   Police would not give details of the incident, but The Miami
Herald reported today that two freshmen, both 18-year-old male
fraternity pledges, were threatened with a knife at the Pi Lambda
Phi house.
   Also Thursday, a judge in Sharpes cited Humphrey's bizarre
behavior when he upheld a $1 million bond on the charge that
Humphrey assaulted his 79-year-old grandmother.
   ``I see before me a very disturbed individual,'' Circuit Judge
Martin Budnick said. ``I see a great deal of acting out ...
neurotic or psychotic behavior.''
   Budnick ruled that Humphrey is a danger to the community. But he
indicated he would consider another request for bond reduction and
wanted to hear medical testimony about Humphrey's mental condition.
   Humphrey's grandmother testified she didn't want to press
charges and would welcome Humphrey back into her home, where
Humphrey's mother also lives.
   ``I want it dropped ... definitely,'' Elna Hlavaty, her right
cheek and right eye badly bruised, said as Humphrey looked on.
   She said she didn't fear her grandson, although she had called
police repeatedly.
   Ms. Hlavaty said she couldn't remember details of the night she
was hurt, other than that she bruised her right side when she fell
on a concrete floor.
   Sheriff's Deputy Douglas Hammack testified she told him the
night of the arrest that she feared Humphrey would beat her again.
   Warrants also have been issued for Humphrey in Indian River
County for attempted sexual battery and armed burglary in an attack
on a woman two years ago.
   Four women and a man, all students at the University of Florida
or Santa Fe Community College, were slain last month in three
attacks. Three victims were mutilated; one was decapitated, police
said.
   Humphrey and Stephen Michael Bates, a 30-year-old Lakeland
short-order cook, have been mentioned publicly as suspects. Bates
has been held in the Polk County Jail on $100,500 bail since his
Aug. 29 arrest in an unrelated assault.
   In Colorado, meanwhile, authorities disclosed Thursday that
Humphrey was arrested two weeks before the Gainesville killings
began on charges of theft and disorderly conduct for failing to pay
for $12 worth of gasoline at a convenience store near Ordway, a
town about 160 miles southeast of Denver.
   When he was booked into the county jail, Humphrey began
``hollering, yelling and flipping out,'' Sgt. Allan Turner of the
Crowley County sheriff's department said. Humphrey also threatened
suicide but didn't threaten anyone else, Turner said.

<HEAD>``Today'' Drops in Ratings, ``Good Morning America'' Gains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC's ``Today,'' which is trying to rebound
against ABC's front-running ``Good Morning America,'' was the only
network morning show that failed to increase its ratings last week,
the A.C. Nielsen Co. said Friday.
   ``Today'' actually lost sixth-tenths of a ratings point as it
came in second to ``Good Morning America'' for the 35th consecutive
week, Nielsen said.
   ``Today,'' which rose to a 3.7 rating two weeks ago when anchor
Bryant Gumbel was reporting from the Middle East, slipped to a 3.1
last week.
   ABC's morning show showed a 10 percent increase in audience,
averaging a 4.3 rating, and ``CBS This Morning'' showed a slight
increase, getting a 2.5 rating. Each ratings point represents
931,000 homes.
   On Monday, the ``Today'' studio will inaugurate a new set.
   The show's ratings woes began before the departure of co-anchor
Jane Pauley and the January appointment of Deborah Norville as her
successor.
   On Tuesday, Norville announced that she is pregnant and expects
to give birth in March, but she did not say how long she would be
away from the show.
   Former ``Today'' co-host Joe Garagiola, 64, who rejoined the
show as a third co-anchor in June, left the show for four weeks on
Aug. 31 to undergo elective surgery for an undisclosed medical
problem.

<HEAD>Steroid Use Among Teen-agers Said to be Growing</HEAD>

   Teen-agers appear to be using more
body-building steroids despite the health risks of the illegal
drugs, federal health officials said Friday.
   What's more, the officials said that coaches, teachers, parents
and other adults may subtly be encouraging the trend.
   The assessment was contained in a report, by the inspector
general of the Department of Health and Human Services, that
estimated more than 250,000 adolescents, mostly boys, have used
steroids.
   Health Secretary Louis Sullivan called the finding
``disturbing'' and said he was ``concerned that some adults who are
charged with our young people's welfare might be passively
accepting or even tacitly approving'' use of the drugs that build
up muscles and strength.''
   Dick Stickle, executive director of a substance abuse program of
the National Federation of State High School Associations, said
coaches can appear to condone steroid use with off-the-cuff
comments such as, ``Everybody uses steroids now in sports,'' or by
telling a young athlete, ``If you were a little larger, a little
stronger, you could be a starter next year.''
   Sullivan said an interagency task force has been formed to look
into new approaches to stemming illegal steroid use. Also, the Food
and Drug Administration is conducting an educational campaign
targeted at young athletes and their coaches, he said, and the
department is launching a public affairs campaign on the issue.
   In the best-known case of steroid use by an athlete, Canadian
sprinter Ben Johnson lost his gold medal in the 1988 Olympics in
when he tested positive. He was disqualified and barred from
competing for two years.
   The report by Inspector General Richard Kusserow estimated that
262,000 students in grades 7 through 12 are using or have used
steroids, based on a 1989 survey by the National Institute on Drug
Abuse.
   The report estimated 5 percent to 11 percent of teen-age boys
use steroids. Among girls, the estimated range was 0.5 percent to
2.5 percent.
   The report, based on interviews with 30 knowledgeable
professionals and 72 current or former steroid users, as well as a
review of recent studies, said steroid use among the young appears
to be rising.
   More than half the users questioned said they had started using
steroids by age 16; 85 percent said they had started by age 17. All
but one said they used injectable steroids.
   The effects of steroids can be physical as well as psychological.
   Users exhibit addictive behavior, although it has not been
proven that these drugs are habit-forming, the experts said. Other
possible psychological effects are increased irritability, violent
behavior, depression, mania, psychosis and suicide.
   Among the physical effects are acne, fluid retention, breast
development in males, masculinization in females, reversible
sterility in males, increased cholesterol levels and high blood
pressure, the report said.
   Also, because adolescents' bodies are still developing, they are
at special risk for some adverse effects, including stunted growth
and long-term dependence on steroids, the report said.

   The Pentagon is trying to increase the
``creature comfort'' quotient for troops in the Mideast by lifting
weight restrictions on mail and telling service men and women to
pack an FM radio.
   Fighting boredom in the far-flung fields of potential battle
could become a major problem for troops deployed in Operation
Desert Shield as long as a military stalemate continues.
   ``There's nothing there but desert _ no women, no liquor, no
fun,'' one military officer said of his colleagues' deployment on
the front lines of the Saudi Arabian-Kuwait border.
   So on Friday, the 12-ounce restriction on military mail to APO
and FPO addresses in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf was lifted.
   And an all-points message went out to those units still
deploying that the troops should be encouraged to bring a personal
portable FM radio now that the Armed Forces radio network has begun
broadcasting in Saudi Arabia.
   Officials also said they were trying to increase shipments of
movies, newspapers, and library books.
   Shipments of films from bases in the United States and Western
European will arrive within 48 hours. Boxes of assorted books from
military libraries are expected to be in Saudi Arabia within six to
eight days, officials said.
   ``They have a thirst to know what's going on,'' Army spokesman
Col. Bill Mulvey said of the troops. ``They want to know not only
about the current crisis situation, but also about who's leading in
the American League East, or what's going on with the pre-season
NFL.''
   The military radio and television network known as AFRTS ``has
begun broadcasting an FM radio service in Saudi Arabia,'' the
Pentagon told commanders.
   The change in mail distribution became possible because the
military postal system in Saudi Arabia has become more organized
and ``sufficient airlift capabilities are now in place to handle
the increased volume of mail,'' a Pentagon statement said.
   ``All classes of mail up to the maximum weights allowed will now
be accepted,'' the statement said.
   Those who want to send packages or mail to particular service
members should check with his or her unit to determine whether an
Army Post Office or Fleet Post Office designation has been
established, a spokesman said.
   It is taking an average of seven days for first class mail to
reach Saudi Arabia, the statement said.
   Tobacco products and U.S. stamps depicting the American flag may
be sent, the statement said.
   Erroneous reports that such products were not allowed have
resulted in ``some isolated cases'' in which letters or packages
have been returned, the statement said.

   NASA workers entered Columbia's rear
compartment Friday and began preparing the area for this weekend's
removal of a fuel pump that is believed to be the source of an
elusive hydrogen leak.
   The space agency's third attempt to send the shuttle on an
astronomy mission was halted Wednesday after hydrogen flooded the
compartment. Engineers suspect the fuel is coming from one of three
recirculation pumps.
   Workers planned to remove insulation around the pumps on
Saturday and replace a package containing all three pumps on
Sunday. A series of tests will follow.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is aiming for
a fourth launch attempt early in the week of Sept. 17.
   Columbia's first countdown was stopped in late May because of
leaking hydrogen. The second was halted last week due to
communications problems with one of four telescopes inside the
cargo bay.
   The telescopes constitute the $150 million Astro observatory,
which will probe ultraviolet light and X-rays emitted from stars,
galaxies, a supernova and a comet during Columbia's nine- to 10-day
flight.

<HEAD>Court Asked to Break Attorney-Client Privilege in Stuart Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors trying to crack the troubling case of
Charles Stuart, who allegedly shot his pregnant wife and later
killed himself, asked the state's highest court Friday to force his
lawyer to talk.
   Suffolk County Assistant District Attorney Thomas Mundy argued
before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court that a grand jury
will be deprived of ``potentially relevant information'' if
attorney John Dawley is not compelled to testify about his final
conversation with Stuart.
   But attorneys representing the Stuart family argued that the
court will be setting a dangerous precedent by tampering with the
ages-old attorney-client privilege.
   Chief Justice Paul Liacos agreed that it would be difficult to
make an exception to the attorney-client privilege.
   Dawley met with Charles Stuart as his attorney on Jan. 3, the
day before Stuart drove to Boston's Tobin Bridge and apparently
committed suicide. He apparently had learned that his 24-year-old
brother, Matthew, had gone to police and implicated him in his
wife's murder.
   Carol Stuart, 30, was shot to death Oct. 23, during what her
husband had claimed was a robbery attempt by a lone black gunman
after the couple had attended a childbirth class. The Stuarts'
prematurely-born son, Christopher, died 17 days later.
   Public interest in the crime was heightened by a dramatic,
tape-recorded telephone conversation between Stuart and an
emergency dispatcher who tracked down the Stuarts' location in
order to send an ambulance.
   The crime shocked Bostonians and aggravated racial tensions,
particularly after a black man was prominently named as a suspect.
The crime's hold on the public imagination grew greater still when
it became clear that the prime suspect was Stuart himself.
   Prosecutors are most interested in learning the extent of
Matthew Stuart's involvement in the slaying. In their arguments
before the court, prosecutors gave the first details in open court
about Matthew Stuart's testimony before the grand jury.
   Mundy told the court that Matthew Stuart has told the grand jury
that he was solicited by his brother to participate in an insurance
scam.
   Matthew testified that he drove his car alongside his brother's
the night of the shooting and was only 5 to 6 feet away from him
when he was handed a bag of items including the murder weapon,
Mundy said. But Matthew testified that he neither saw Carol Stuart
inside the car nor noticed that his brother was injured, Mundy said.
   The grand jury, Mundy said, ``is faced with a question: Was
Matthew Stuart a naive thief who was nearsighted or was he a
willing participant in murder?''
   Mundy argued that the sanctity of the attorney-client privilege
is designed to ``ensure the administration of justice'' and asked
the court to consider making an exception in the Stuart case to
avoid a miscarriage of justice.
   Nancy Gertner, the attorney representing Matthew Stuart, told
the court that overriding the attorney-client privilege would mean
that attorneys could no longer be trusted with confidences.
   ``If Charles Stuart and others had the slightest idea that their
conversations would be disclosed down the line, they would never
want to talk,'' said Gertner.
   Attorney Richard Clayman, who represents the rest of the Stuart
family, said the attorney-client privilege is ``sacred, fundamental
and never waived.''
   The court did not say when it will rule.

   The government must strike a delicate balance
between its duty to clean up the savings and loan crisis and the
need to protect S&amp;L assets that have environmental value, federal
officials told a congressional panel Friday.
   The Resolution Trust Corp., the agency set up last year to take
over and dispose of failed thrift institutions, has under its
control 1,853 S&amp;L properties believed to have important
environmental, historical, recreational or scientific value. The
properties have a total value of about $340 million, the agency
says.
   The agency ``must engage in a balancing act between
(environmental) concerns and the obligation to resolve the savings
and loan crisis at the least cost to the taxpayer,'' said Peter H.
Monroe, president of the RTC's oversight board.
   Monroe appeared as a witness before the House Task Force on the
RTC. The panel's chairman, Rep. Bruce F. Vento, D-Minn., accused
the Interior Department of delaying its effort to help the RTC
evaluate the environmentally sensitive properties.
   The RTC is charged with protecting taxpayers by getting as much
money as it can for the thrift assets it sells. Restrictions
against commercial development on land tend to reduce its market
value sharply.
   Some environmental activists see the government's control of
those lands as a rare opportunity for promoting conservation.
   The lands range from natural habitats of endangered wildlife to
``pocket parks'' in cities to condominium developments located near
scenic sites. A group of properties, for example, lies in the
Balcones Canyonlands, an area west of Austin, Texas, that is home
to several endangered songbirds and other species.
   The 1,853 parcels, many of them situated in Texas, Arizona,
California and Florida, are a small proportion of the 36,000 or so
S&amp;L properties under the RTC's control _ but they have stirred
interest in Congress and the environmental community.
   ``It's plain old common sense for a landowner to learn the value
of a property before it is sold,'' Vento told the hearing. ``Let's
make sure the seller is beware, too.''
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the RTC have drafted an
agreement under which the service, part of the Interior Department,
would review the RTC's inventory of properties. The service then
would recommend conservation restrictions on the use of properties
that are considered environmentally sensitive.
   The agreement was scheduled to be signed by officials from both
agencies on Aug. 3, but it was put on hold indefinitely.
   ``What we don't need with regard to the S&amp;L bailout is more
delay,'' Vento said, addressing Interior Department official Scott
Sewell, another witness. ``You've been dillydallying with it for
the last five weeks.''
   Sewell said the agreement has been held up by reviews within the
Interior Department, the need for computer software and the fact
that ``the information we're dealing with at this point is still
not specific.''
   ``I know it seems like a snail's pace,'' he said. ``We are
proceeding with all due haste to work through the process.''
   Rep. Stan Parris of Virginia, the panel's ranking Republican,
cautioned that the environmental issue should be kept in
perspective.
   The special properties should be protected, he said, ``but we
must be careful to balance that very desirable goal with the
primary purpose of the RTC.''
   Burdensome requirements on the thrift agency could slow the S&amp;L
bailout and scare off potential buyers of assets, Parris said.
   Some of the properties were commercially developed when they
were in private hands, since the laws governing land use are
relatively lenient when assets are privately owned.
   Now that they are under government control and subject to
stricter regulations, environmentalists and historic
preservationists want to seize the chance to protect them and to
attach some conditions to their future sale.
   ``It's the greatest opportunity of the century to protect
important environmental lands,'' Richard Lowerre, a project
director at the Texas Center for Policy Studies in Austin, said in
an interview.
   Vento has said he is seeking ``compatible use'' of the RTC
properties. Some could be sold to state and local governments, he
said, while others could be bought by private developers, with some
protective conservation measures included as a condition of sale.

McCuen said.

   ``This is not a G or a PG-13 type of movie,'' he said. ``They

   John Sasso, who left as manager of the Dukakis
presidential campaign after a flap over his aggressive tactics,
pulled a switch on a car rental company that left employees
thinking he'd stolen a car.
   Sasso, renting a car on the island of Nantucket as the Labor Day
weekend began, said he was given a key that didn't fit the car he
was given. He went behind the counter to find the right keys
because nobody was there to help.
   ``I certainly didn't think I did anything wrong under the
circumstances,'' Sasso said. He added that he'd had to wait 25
minutes with two small children and had gotten fed up, leaving his
credit card and a note.
   Hertz workers, though, didn't know him, saw a man leaving with a
car they'd rented to someone else, and told police the Ford Tempo
was stolen. Police recovered the car at 2 a.m. Saturday, the next
morning.
   ``It was not a major crime, but it was wrong. He annoyed me,''
said Dave Murphy, who runs the Hertz agency. He said he won't press
charges. ``I don't want to spend a lot of time with John Sasso
about a set of keys.''
   Murphy said he did not know it was Sasso who had taken the car
until Sasso called him on Saturday.
   Sasso resigned as Michael Dukakis' campaign manager in September
1987 after it was disclosed he had distributed a videotape showing
rival Sen. Joseph Biden Jr., D-Del., had copied speeches by British
Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock.

for slaughtering hundreds of imported British sheep.
   The former actress, a militant campaigner for animal rights,
released the text of a letter she had sent to President Francois
Mitterrand accusing the farmers of illegal acts of cruelty.
   She cited incidents Thursday and in late August in which French
farmers slaughtered more than 700 British sheep and lambs, burning
some alive. She demanded an immediate halt to ``this revolting,
insolent and demented waste.''
   Farmers protesting lower-priced imported lamb have beaten
British truck drivers, hijacked lamb trucks, blocked roads and
burned a consignment of sheep.
   On Friday, more than 200 farmers protested meat imports outside

   Prince Alexander Karadjordjevic,
whose father served as Regent before the royal family was forced to
flee Yugoslavia in 1941, was feted by hundreds of supporters Friday
on his first visit home in 49 years.
   He is the first male member of the banished Karadjordjevic
dynasty to visit Yugoslavia since the communists assumed power
after World War II.
   Like all the other members of Yugoslavia's former ruling family,
the prince is still legally banned from the country on the basis of
a 1945 communist law that is still on the books.
   But hundreds of people greeted him with tumultuous applause when
he appeared at Belgrade's National Museum to promote a British
biography about his father, Prince Pavle. The prince became Regent
after King Alexander was assassinated in 1934 and served until
shortly before the family fled the invading Nazis in 1941.
   Alexander's sister, Elizaveta, was the first member of the
Karadjordjevic family to defy the legal ban on coming to Yugoslavia
during a visit last year and accompanied him Friday.
   Alexander, who is now in his 60s, was quoted by the state news
agency Tanjug as saying he was delighted to be in his homeland. He
plans to stay a week and tour Serbia.

<HEAD>Premier Li Peng Dismissed From Government Economic Post</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A little-known political and business figure was
named Friday to replace Premier Li Peng as shepherd of China's
stumbling economy.
   It was not immediately known how the loss of the economic post
could affect Li, 61, who faced criticism for his strict fiscal
policies and his role in the 1989 crackdown on the nation's
pro-democracy movement.
   The China News Service said Li asked to be relieved as minister
of the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy so he could
concentrate on his duties as premier. Li took charge of the
commission in 1988, the same year he became premier.
   Li remains one of China's top leaders and the main person in
charge of government policy on a day-to-day basis.
   Radio Beijing and China Central Broadcasting said Li's
replacement was Chen Jinhua, 61. The China News Service said Chen
was a ``longtime leader in economic work'' who had been president
of the China National Petrochemical Corp. since 1983 and held
several political posts in Shanghai.
   Li's austerity program has reduced inflation, which peaked at
about 40 percent in 1988, but it brought the nation to the brink of
recession and forced millions of small factories to close.
   The program also halted many market-oriented reforms and
returned much of the economic decision-making power to the central
government. Local and provincial goverments had gained a greater
say in economic affairs during the past decade.
   Li was in the forefront of officials advocating a hard line
against last year's student-led pro-democracy efforts, which ended
when tanks and riot troops were ordered into Beijing's Tiananmen
Square.
   He was an opponent of former Communist Party General Secretary
Zhao Ziyang, who pushed rapid economic reform but was ousted for
allegedly supporting the pro-democracy protests.
   Li spent many years as an engineer in various ministries before
being elevated to full membership in the party Central Committee in
1978.
   In 1987, Li became a member of the power-wielding standing
committee of the Politburo.
   The National People's Congress standing committee, whose 135
members meet between annual sessions of the full congress,
concluded an 11-day session Friday.
   From 1977 to 1979, Chen was a deputy chairman of Shanghai's
Revolutionary Committee, which replaced the city government during
the tumultuous Cultural Revolution. He was deputy mayor of Shanghai
from 1979 to 1983.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev carries a bag full of
troubles to Helsinki.
   He's attending a summit full of hope, with the United States and
the Soviet Union united in opposition to the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait. It is the first time they have been on the same side of a
global crisis since World War II.
   But at home, Gorbachev's popularity is plummeting, the Soviet
economy is defying predictions it couldn't get worse, and most of
the 15 Soviet republics, including Mother Russia, have declared
sovereignty or independence from the Communist government that
Gorbachev heads.
   After the summit, Gorbachev is expected to rush back to Moscow
to present economic reforms that are likely to strip central
authorities of much of their domestic power and largely dismember
the state planning apparatus that Josef Stalin assembled at the
cost of millions of lives.
   Despite the tumult on the home front, Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze has hailed the Sunday summit in Helsinki as
a ``landmark.'' Soviet media are describing it as a new phase in
superpower cooperation.
   History could well be made in Helsinki.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said in an
interview Friday that the Soviet Union would be willing to send
military forces to the Middle East under a military staff committee
that included officers from the five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council: the United States, Soviet Union, France, Britain
and China.
   The aim, he said, was not only to help the United States enforce
Security Council sanctions against Iraq, but also to impose Soviet
controls on any unilateral military actions against Iraq by the
United States.
   The implication is that despite the collapse of the Soviet
empire in Eastern Europe and the malaise at home, the Soviet Union
retains its superpower status.
   But that view is not universally held. Andrei Kortunov, a young
Soviet scholar at the USA-Canada Institute, publicly classified his
nation as a regular rather than a super power last June. His
analysis has been embraced by a number of respected American
sovietologists.
   ``The Soviet Union is not still a superpower, at least as
pertains to its capability of projecting global power in a
low-violence conflict. Of course, it still has vast nuclear
arsenals,'' said Marshall Shulman, a Columbia University professor
who is visiting Moscow.
   A senior Western diplomat was more cautious, simply saying, ``It
has been a multipower world for quite some time now.''
   The diplomat, who spoke on condition that he not be further
identified, noted that even the United States generally seeks
accord with its allies before exerting military muscle.
   Bush, at least, in requesting the meeting with Gorbachev,
appears inclined not only to acknowledge the Soviet Union as a once
and future superpower, but to recognize Gorbachev as the de facto
leader of the reform movement in the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev faces the threat of eclipse by Boris Yeltsin, who last
May 29 was elected to the newly created post of president of the
Russian Federation, the largest Soviet republic.
   The Russian Congress of People's Deputies quickly declared
``sovereignty,'' asserting that its laws take precedence over
Soviet laws on Russian territory, and that the Russian _ rather
than the central Soviet _ government controlled the republic's vast
natural resources.
   The declaration stopped short of the independence proclaimed
earlier by the three Baltic republics, but it paved the way for
radical sovereignty decrees by other republics, including the
Ukraine.
   The independence and sovereignty movements promise to transform
the shape of the Soviet Union's borders and government structure.
   Yeltsin is also having his way with economic reforms, beating
the Gorbachev team in preparing a radical package to transfer
economic decision-making powers away from central authorities to
the republics.
   Yeltsin introduced his reforms to the Russian parliament last
Monday, whereas Gorbachev is due to propose his to the national
legislature next week, Monday at the earliest.
   Public pressure appears to have forced Gorbachev to jettison a
moderate reform package advocated by his ally, Prime Minister
Nikolai Ryzhkov, in favor of a more radical version drafted by
economist Stanislav Shatalin _ who is also credited with writing
the reforms proposed by Yeltsin.
   Gorbachev's spokesman, Vitaly Ignatenko, said the two programs
would be very similar.
   Widespread consumer shortages, five years into the Gorbachev
administration, are fueling public anger against the Soviet leader
and his allies.
   Reformist Moscow Mayor Gavriil Popov, who quit the Communist
Party in July, renewed calls on Friday for the resignation of
Ryzhkov.
   Gorbachev, who in the West is considered a reformer, is viewed
increasingly in the Soviet Union as a moderate, or even
conservative. Yeltsin hs overtaken Gorbachev in popularity,
according to some polls.

   The 19-year-old son of a state legislator
talked for hours about his hatred for his parents only weeks before
he shot his mother with a hunting arrow, his girlfriend testified
Friday.
   ``He told me about how his parents had been cruel to him,''
Jennifer Bolstad told the jury in Dodge County Court.
   Ms. Bolstad, a student at Mount Mary College in Milwaukee,
testified in the second day of Chad Goetsch's trial. Goetsch is
accused of first degree intentional homicide for fatally shooting
his mother, Carolyn, 51, with an arrow.
   He also is accused of reckless endangerment during a violent
struggle with his father, state Rep. Robert Goetsch, seconds after
his mother was shot Nov. 8 at their home in the town of Oak Grove.
   Ms. Bolstad said she spoke to Goetsch on the telephone about his
parents at least twice last October.
   ``He told me that she (his mother) treated him badly, that she
would be nice to him and then really mean to him,'' Ms. Bolstad
said.
   Ms. Bolstad said she suggested he get away if he didn't want to
be around his parents. She said Goetsch responded that he couldn't
escape his parents' control and that he loved them, ``at least his
mother.''
   District Attorney Kevin Schram reminded Ms. Bolstad that she
testified at a preliminary hearing last December that Goetsch told
her he couldn't go on with his life unless his parents were dead.
   She said that testimony was correct.

<HEAD>Three Leftists Plead Guilty to Bombing the U.S. Capitol</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Three leftist radicals pleaded guilty Friday
to bombing the U.S. Capitol and conspiring to set off explosions at
eight locations in a two-year campaign of ``armed propaganda'' to
protest government policies.
   Marilyn J. Buck, Linda S. Evans and Laura J. Whitehorn each
pleaded guilty to maliciously damaging the U.S. Capitol by setting
off a bomb on Nov. 7, 1983 that blew a hole in the wall outside the
Senate chamber.
   Evans, 43, told U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene that the
bomb was exploded to protest the American invasion of Grenada. Five
paintings were damaged and the door to Democratic leader Robert
Byrd's office was blown off its hinges.
   The three women also pleaded guilty to conspiring to bomb the
Capitol and seven other buildings in Washington and New York
between 1983 and 1985 in what Whitehorn called an effort ``to
resist and protest the unjust policies of the U.S. government.''
   The charges carry a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison plus
fines totaling $20,000. Greene scheduled sentencing for Nov. 28.
   As part of the plea agreement, charges will be dropped against
three co-defendants.
   Whitehorn, 45, also pleaded guilty to possession of equipment to
make fake identification documents stemming from an FBI raid in
1985 on a Baltimore apartment she shared with Evans and Buck. That
charge carries a five-year sentence.
   In addition to fake identification documents, authorities also
found typewritten bomb-making instructions bearing Evans'
fingerprints plus 15 pocket watches similar to the type used to
detonate the Capitol bomb. Nine watches were altered to be timing
devices, according to a statement of evidence from prosecutors.
   All eight bombs ``bore marked similarities'' to each other and
were triggered by altered pocket watches made by the same
manufacturer, the statement said.
   The group, variously identifying itself as the Armed Resistance
Unit, the Revolutionary Fighting Group and the Red Guerrilla
Resistance, claimed responsibility for each of the bombings in
communiques to news organizations.
   Evans, Buck and Whitehorn have participated in radical
activities since the 1960s when they were members of the Students
for a Democratic Society, according to their spokeswoman, Judy
Greenspan.
   None of the eight bombings caused any injuries.
   After the proceedings were recessed, about 50 supporters stood
up in the courtroom and applauded the defendants, who saluted them
with raised fists.
   Outside the courthouse, demonstrators chanted ``Free All
Political Prisoners'' as prosecutors held a news conference.
   But U.S Attorney Jay B. Stephens told reporters that law
enforcement agencies ``will not tolerate terrorism to direct the
policies of our government.''
   Prosecutors said that after the defendants are sentenced, they
will drop bombing charges against Susan Rosenberg, Timothy A. Blunk
and Alan Berkman.
   The government had legal problems with those cases because of a
Supreme Court decision last May on the issue of double jeopardy,
according to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The three defendants claimed prosecutors could not use evidence
that was the basis of earlier convictions to prove they
participated in the four Washington bombings.
   All six defendants, except Whitehorn, are serving lengthy prison
terms for possession of explosives or firearms.
   Buck, 42, is serving a 50-year prison term for participating in
a string of armed robberies, including a 1981 holdup of a armored
car near Nyack, N.Y., in which two policemen and a guard were
killed. She also was convicted of helping convicted murderer Joanne
Chesimard escape from a New Jersey prison in 1979.
   Evans is serving a 40-year prison for illegally purchasing
firearms.
   Rosenberg and Blunk are serving 58-year terms for possessing an
arsenal of explosives they were caught loading into a rented
storage bin in Cherry Hill, N.J. in 1984.
   Berkman, who suffers from Hodgkins disease, is serving a 10-year
prison term for possession of explosives and munitions authorities
found in a garage in Doylestown, Pa., that is also linked to the
bombings, authorities said.
   A seventh defendant in the case, Elizabeth Duke, is a fugitive.

<HEAD>Seattle School Board Approves Plan to Ease Racial Balance
Guidelines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The School Board has approved a plan to relax
racial balance guidelines despite opposition from civil rights
activists who said it would re-segregate schools.
   School busing was a major issue in last year's city elections,
when voters passed an initiative asking the School Board to ban
busing to achieve racial balance.
   The new plan, approved 4-3 Tuesday night, allows 75 percent of a
school's racial makeup to consist of any one racial group,
including whites. The plan replaces a requirement that no more than
50 percent of a school's enrollment be from one minority group, 70
percent from all minority groups, or 65 percent white.
   The new plan means a school could be 100 percent minority. For
example, enrollment could be 75 percent black and 25 percent Asian.
   ``The NAACP will do whatever is necessary, including lawsuits,
to prevent the re-segregation of Seattle public schools,'' said
Larry Steele, president of the Seattle chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   Supporters of the plan said it would reduce mandatory busing by
allowing more minorities, who are bused in greater numbers than are
whites, to attend their neighborhood schools. It would also give
whites more school choices.
   ``I never have and never will favor re-segregating the school
district,'' said board member Ken Eastlack, who wrote the proposal.
   ``All I want is equity. It's interesting that people feel more
choice will result in segregation. I don't think that will happen.''
   The new plan takes effect immediately but would not allow
students to switch schools immediately. An estimated 3,000 students
on a waiting list will have a chance of attending their preferred
schools this fall after officials review the attendance at each
school.

   CBS anchorman Dan Rather, in the Middle East
since the Persian Gulf crisis began Aug. 2, will help cover the
Bush-Gorbachev summit in Helsinki this weekend, then may return
home, CBS said Thursday.
   He will be one of four U.S. network anchormen at the Helsinki
summit. The others are Cable News Network's Bernard Shaw, ABC's
Peter Jennings, and NBC's Tom Brokaw.
   Brokaw, who spent a week in Saudi Arabia reporting on the Gulf
crisis, will do part of ``NBC Nightly News'' Friday from Moscow as
part of the network's preview of the Helsinki summit, NBC News said.
   Rather, anchoring his newscast for the rest of this week from
Saudi Arabia, ``is tentatively scheduled to come home'' after the
Helsinki summit, ``barring another serious development in the
Gulf,'' CBS spokeswoman Donna Dees said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More unmarried couples are buying homes
together than at any time in the past, according to a survey of
major lenders conducted by the Mortgage Bankers Association of
America.
   ``Eighty-nine percent of those surveyed reported more `mingles'
purchasing homes as compared to five years ago,'' said James W.
Nelson, president-elect of the trade association.
   ``I suspect it's the result of greater social acceptance, on the
one hand ... and recognition of the economic benefits both in terms
of mortgage interest deductibility'' and home ownership, he told a
news conference.
   Nelson, president of Eberhardt Co. in Minneapolis, added that
growth in sales to unmarried couples also is recognition by lenders
that many are qualified and capable of handling the financial
aspects of buying a home.
   Nelson also said the Persian Gulf crisis has pushed mortgage
interest rates up one-half of a percentage point since the Aug. 2
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   ``This translates into about $40 more per month on a mortgage of
$100,000,'' he said, adding that the rate increase and tighter
mortgage underwriting will exacerbate affordability problems for
many first-time homebuyers.
   Sixty percent of the 20 mortgage companies in the survey
reported more stringent lending standards because of government
requirements, economic downturns in some markets and increased loan
delinquencies.
   ``It is likely that mortgage rates will stabilize at currently
higher levels over the next few months and, in the short-term,
adjustable rate mortgage rates will look more attractive,'' Nelson
said.
   ``However, we expect long-term rates to come back down somewhat
... once the outcome of the Persian Gulf crisis is resolved,'' he
continued, adding: ``If the shooting starts, all bets are off.''

   Farmers and students opposed to
imports of agricultural products fought riot police in provincial
cities Friday, police and news reports said.
   More than 20,000 police and government officials were reportedly
mobilized across the country. Police said hundreds of protesters
were arrested, but no injuries were reported.
   Scuffles and violent clashes broke out in the southern
opposition stronghold of Kwangju and several other provincial
cities when riot police blocked about 6,000 farmers from attending
planned rallies.
   In Kwangju, about 1,500 riot troopers firing volleys of tear gas
moved on to Chonnam University, where 3,000 farmers and students
gathered, according to Yonhap, the South Korean news agency. About
500 students fought back with firebombs and rocks, Yonhap said.
   The demonstrators called for an end to imports of agricultural
products and urged South Korean farmers to rise up and topple the
government of President Roh Tae-woo.
   The United States and other advocates of free trade have asked
South Korea to open its markets wider, reduce subsidies in exports
and remove trade barriers.
   At a cathedral in Chonju, police allowed about 1,000 farmers to
hold a peaceful indoor rally. In Andong, about 600 hundreds of
farmers supported by radical students staged running protests inde of gasoline

   South African President F.W. de Klerk, who
this week invited representatives of all races to negotiate a new
constitution, will meet with President Bush on Sept. 24, the White
House announced Friday.
   The two leaders are to discuss ``the current negotiating process
underway in South Africa and ways it may be encouraged,'' White
House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said in a statement.
   De Klerk's government has been engaged in negotiations with the
African National Congress on power sharing under a government that
would do away with the apartheid system of racial separation.
   A June visit for de Klerk had been set up at Bush's invitation
but the South African president canceled it indefinitely.
   African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela did visit with
Bush at the White House in June and addressed a joint session of
Congress during a U.S. tour in which he was greeted with accolades
everywhere.
   Mandela, freed this year by de Klerk after 27 years as a
political prisoner, has said his group does not object to the
Bush-de Klerk meeting, as long as the United States maintains its
economic sanctions against South Africa to protest apartheid.
   The White House announcement follows de Klerk's call for a new
constitution and comes against a backdrop of tension stemming from
the South African army's involvement in a township shooting that
killed 11 people.
   No South African leader has visited the United States since
apartheid was implemented formally in the late 1940s, officials
there said.
   De Klerk recently called South Africa's anti-apartheid course
``irreversible.''
   The government opened talks this year with the ANC, the main
black opposition group, on halting anti-government violence and
removing other obstacles toward negotiations on a new constitution.

victims of child abuse and neglect.
   _The YWCA of Elgin, Ill., for its Family Literacy Project geared
to low-income people with limited English ability.
   _The Center for Family Resources in Hempstead, N.Y., for its
Starting Together program serving urban and rural families.
   _Whitley County Communities for Children of Williamsburg, Ky.,
which has a mobile literacy program serving five rural communities
in Appalachia.
   _The Montana Office of Public Instruction for its Family
Learning Center, which addresses the needs of Native Americans and
welfare mothers and children.
   _Delmarva Rural Ministries, Inc. of Dover, Del., for its classes
serving migrant workers and migrant workers.
   _Cohn Adult Learning Center for Future Directions, of Nashville,
which offers computer instruction in a public housing project.
   _Lawrence Public Library in Massachusetts, for its Newcomer
Family Literacy Project helping immigrants learn to read.

   The Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy was founded in
1989 as part of the Community Foundation of Greater Washington,
Inc., a non-profit organization.
   In addition to the grant program, funded through donations, the
foundation supports training and professional development for
teachers and has published ``First Teachers,'' a family literacy
handbook.

   Barbara Bush and Raisa Gorbachev will visit
over tea, look at old books and view Western art together as their
husbands hold their superpower summit in Helsinki, Finland.
   With Finland's first lady, Tellervo Koivisto, the two wives will
meet Sunday for coffee, lunch, and tea while President Bush and
President Gorbachev are engaged in talks on the Persian Gulf and
other matters. Mrs. Gorbachev and Mrs. Bush also will visit a
university library.
   Mrs. Bush has a full schedule beginning with a visit Saturday
afternoon to historical Porvoo in the countryside outside Helsinki,
aides said. She will be accompanied by Virginia Weinman, wife of
the U.S. ambassador to Finland, and Rebecca Matlock, wife of the
U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union.
   Their plans include a tour of the 14th century Lutheran church
in Porvoo, a village of 20,000 people and Finland's second oldest
town, founded in 1346. They also will visit the town museum and are
likely to take a shopping tour on the town's picturesque
cobblestone streets.
   ``She likes to see a little bit more of the countryside when she
travels,'' said Mrs. Bush's press secretary, Anna Perez.
   Mrs. Bush probably will also have a private dinner with the two
ambassadors' wives while the president has a working dinner with
aides.
   On Sunday, Mrs. Koivisto will host Mrs. Gorbachev and Mrs. Bush
at the presidential palace for morning coffee.
   Mrs. Bush and Mrs. Gorbachev then will go to the University of
Helsinki Library to help mark its 350th birthday and view the first
book ever printed in Finnish.
   The two first ladies will join their husbands at the palace for
lunch, and then drop by the U.S. embassy to view a collection of
Western art.
   Later Sunday afternoon, Mrs. Gorbachev will host a tea at the
Soviet Embassy before the wives join their husbands at the send-off
press conference that concludes the summit.
   The weather forecast in Helsinki was chilly and damp, but there
is one item Mrs. Bush was not expected to pack in her baggage _ a
fur coat. The first lady does not wear furs, considering it not in
keeping with her style.

   Pope John Paul II, continuing his travels
across AIDS-ravaged central Africa, comforted dying patients Friday
and assured them ``you are not alone in your ordeal.''
   Before arriving in Rwanda on the third stop of his 10-day
African trip, the pope visited a hospital in neighboring Burundi
for people with AIDS and other terminal illnesses.
   John Paul appeared moved as he stopped at the bedsides of about
40 men and women at the Prince-Regent Charles Hospital in
Bujumbura. Doctors said 85 percent of the patients have acquired
immune deficiency syndrome and most are in advanced stages of the
disease.
   The pope patted the heads of the patients, touched their
foreheads in the sign of the cross and offered his blessing.
   One of the patients, a woman in her 40s, was barely conscious
while undergoing a blood transfusion.
   ``I know the moment is difficult,'' John Paul said. ``I think
especially of those among you who are afflicted by AIDS, for which
there is still no effective cure.
   ``But I want to tell you, in the name of faith, that you have
reason for hope and you are not alone in your ordeal.''
   The pope instructed the Vatican undersecretary of state,
Archbishop Giovanbatista Re, to make a $10,000 donation to the
hospital.
   The pope has spoken frequently on the problem of AIDS during the
trip, which has also taken him to Tanzania. He has said AIDS is
both a moral and medical issue but told followers use of condoms is
not acceptable to check its spread.
   The World Health Organization estimates that 5 million people in
sub-Saharan Africa have the virus that causes AIDS.
   In Burundi and Rwanda, two tiny countries in the heart of the
central African AIDS belt, health officials estimate up to 40
percent of young urban adults in some areas could be infected by
the virus.
   On his arrival in Kigali after a 45-minute flight, the pope was
met by Maj. Gen. Juvenal Habyarimana, who seized power in a
military coup in 1973.
   In a speech to diplomats, the pope said international aid was
needed to help Rwanda and other developing countries boost their
economies.
   ``We will not cease repeating that there is one humanity, and
that poverty and suffering of a large part of its members cannot be
ignored,'' he said.
   The pope will travel Sunday to Ivory Coast, the final stop on
his trip.

<HEAD>Congress Told of Korean Jet Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress has been notified formally of South
Korea's intention to purchase 120 F-A-18 jet fighters and
components in a $4.7 billion deal crafted last year, the Pentagon
said Friday.
   The program covers a triple-phased arrangement by which the
South Koreans purchase 12 of the aircraft from U.S. production
lines, are provided with kits for 36 aircraft that will be
assembled in Korea, and have licensing agreements allowing 72
aircraft to be produced in Korea.
   The agreement had been a matter of dispute for some months in
Congress, particularly among members who wanted more of the
U.S.-produced aircraft to be included in the deal.
   But the arrangement also provides for modernizing South Korea's
aging air fleet of F-4s and F-5s, and increases its military
alignment with the U.S. forces. This may open the way for some of
the more than 40,000 U.S. troops based there to return home,
another goal for budget-cutters on Capitol Hill.
   The F-A-18 ``Hornet'' primary contractor is McDonnell-Douglas
Corp. of St. Louis, Mo.
   The deal also includes 24 GE F-404 engines, produced by General
Electric of Lynn, Mass.; test and support equipment, software
support, spare and repair parts, personnel and technical training
and maintenance support.
   Under the co-assembly and licensing program, commercial
contracts will cover the technical assistance, production and
assembly line equipment, a Pentagon statement said.

<HEAD>Moscow Mayor Calls For Resignation of Soviet Premier</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN FRIEDMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moscow's radical mayor blamed the central
government Friday for shortages of bread and cigarettes in the
capital and joined the calls for Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov to
resign, press reports said.
   Ryzhkov said on Soviet television Friday night that the nation's
economic problems were due in part to lack of discipline by workers
and disruptive strikes. He said the government would take ``severe
measures'' against disruptive workers.
   Moscow's bread shortage was the result of increased demand by
returning vacationers and students, as well as panic-buying,
Ryzhkov said, apparently trying to steer the blame away from the
government.
   ``The political clock has speeded up sharply,'' Ryzhkov said.
``We are aware that the national economy is in a very serious
situation and tensions are growing all the time.''
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev called together economic experts
earlier Friday to work on combining a radical economic reform plan
with the moderate one that Ryzhkov prepared, the Tass news agency
reported.
   Gorbachev is expected to submit a reform plan after the Soviet
parliament convenes Monday. The plan will be drafted in large part
by Stanislav Shatalin, a reformer who sits on Gorbachev's
Presidential Council, apparently bypassing the proposal by Ryzhkov.
   Reformers such as Russian Federation President Boris N. Yeltsin
have been pushing Gorbachev to adopt a more radical plan than
Ryzhkov's.
   Moscow Mayor Gavriil Popov, at a session of the Russian
parliament, sharply denounced the Soviet government and accused it
of trying to retain full control over the country's economic life,
Tass said.
   He called on Ryzhkov, and the rest of the Council of Ministers,
or Cabinet, to resign. Popov said pressure for Ryzhkov's
resignation was growing across the country and a similar call would
be made at the Soviet parliament next week by a radical wing of
legislators known as the Inter-Regional Group, Tass reported.
   During his televised talk, Ryzhkov did not address the calls for
his resignation, but vowed to stand by his economic plan.
   ``If I believe in my decision, I am going to defend it,''
Ryzhkov said.
   Popov also blasted the Cabinet for barring the Moscow City
Council from selling cigarettes at free-market prices. The
introduction of commercial prices helped relieve the ``tobacco
crisis'' in Moscow in recent days, Tass quoted Popov as saying.
   The official price of a premium pack of Soviet cigarettes rose
this week to 3 rubles, about $4.80, and newspapers reported
consumers grumbled about the increase. The old price for a premium
pack of cigarettes was about 90 cents.
   The government later prohibited the increase.
   Popov said that intervention was a violation of the sovereign
rights of the city as a part of Russia and that Moscow intends to
disregard the ruling, the independent Interfax news agency quoted
him as saying.
   The Soviet Union has been gripped all summer by the worst
shortage of cigarettes in decades. Its causes range from the
closure of factories for repairs to a lack of hard currency to buy
usual quantities of cigarettes from Bulgaria. Angry smokers have
taken to the streets in Moscow, Leningrad and elsewhere, staging
strikes and venting their outrage at local officials like Popov, as
well as the national government.
   In recent days, there has also been a shortage of bread in
Moscow for the first time in more than 25 years. The press blamed
it on the sudden rise in demand when Muscovites returned from their
traditional August vacations.
   Popov said he believes the city needs to set up 500 to 600 small
bakeries _ perhaps using the resources of some of the nation's
defense plants _ to deal with the shortage, Interfax reported. The
City Council suggested that these bakeries be privatized and turned
into family enterprises.

<HEAD>Officials Cancel Yoga Class Because of Devil-Worshiping Argument</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOCCOA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yoga is a form of New Age mysticism that can
lead to devil worship, says a man who led protests that forced
officials to cancel a city-county sponsored yoga class.
   ``The people who are signed up for the class are just walking
into it like cattle to a slaughter,'' said Philip Lawrence. ``Half
of yoga is a branch of Eastern mysticism, and it has strong occult
influences.''
   Lawrence said he is opposing the yoga class as a Christian. He
said other people opposing the classes are from Baptist, Lutheran
and Church of God congregations.
   The class, sponsored by the Toccoa-Stephens County Recreation
Department, was scheduled to begin Monday. It was canceled Aug. 31
after city and county commissioners received a number of complaints
from church members in Toccoa.
   ``The different commissioners got together on the phone, and the
majority decided the class should be canceled,'' Mayor Bill Harris
said. ``Some felt that they were under too much pressure.''
   Leonard Greenspoon, a Clemson University religion professor,
said yoga has become a secularized form of exercise and relaxation.
   ``There's certainly no necessary connection between yoga and
devil worship,'' he said. ``Anybody who's equating Eastern religion
with devil worship has made a big mistake.''
   Roger Terrell, program director for the recreation department,
said he met with yoga teacher Carolyn Davis to make sure the class
would involve only simple stretching and relaxation techniques.
   ``We can't be promoting religion or anything,'' he said. ``It's
strictly for health reasons.''
   Some of the 26 people who had signed up for the yoga class say
they won't let the matter drop. ``This is not the end,'' said
Deborah Hartley. ``This is just the beginning as far as I'm
concerned.''
   She and Katherine Hodges, another would-be yoga student,
complained Tuesday to the county commissioners. She said she also
plans to fight for the class at the next meetings of city-county
commissioners and the recreation board.

<HEAD>Army Readying Anti-Missile Test That Raises Treaty Questions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Army scientists are readying a little-known
Star Wars test in the South Pacific that critics say brings the
anti-missile program close to violating a 1972 treaty outlawing
major missile defenses.
   Monday morning, a Boeing 767 equipped with a 3-ton infrared
sensor is scheduled to depart Boeing Field in Seattle for a two-day
trip to Kwajalein Atoll, an Army missile test range in the Pacific.
   Near the middle of the month _ the Army won't give the exact
date for security reasons _ the aircraft will make its first
attempt to track a mock warhead on an intercontinental ballistic
missile fired from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif.
   The ability to use sensors to track incoming missiles and to
distinguish between warheads and decoys is a key element of Star
Wars, which the Pentagon hopes will be ready for deployment within
a few years. The government has spent about $20 billion on Star
Wars since then-President Reagan launched the project in 1983.
   This month's Kwajalein test will be the start of an
``aggressive, intensive'' series of flight tests for the airborne
sensor over the coming 12 months, Col. Gary M. Stewart, who manages
the aircraft program at the Army's Strategic Defense Command
headquarters at Huntsville, Ala., said in an interview Friday.
   A key question in the debate over the aircraft, known as the
Airborne Optical Adjunct, is whether it could substitute for an
anti-ballistic missile radar, which is prohibited by the 1972 ABM
Treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union.
   The Pentagon says the aircraft is purely experimental and will
not be deployed as part of a Star Wars system.
   John Pike, head of space policy at the Federation of American
Scientists and a Star Wars critic, said, ``It appears to be the
functional equivalent of an ABM radar.''
   Pike said the Soviets may be justified in questioning whether
the airborne sensor is a treaty violation.
   ``If we saw the Russians doing this kind of thing, we would be
pretty bent out of shape about it, and if the Russians were giving
the explanation we are, we wouldn't believe them,'' Pike said.
   Stewart said the Army is certain there is no treaty violation.
   ``We are totally treaty-compliant,'' he said. ``There are no
open issues'' to debate.
   The Army says the airborne sensor is not a prototype for an
anti-missile sensor system. It also argues that the aircraft could
not substitute for an ABM radar because of technical limitations in
its infrared sensor and its on-board computers.
   The aircraft's first flight was May 11, when it began a series
of tests to observe stars and track satellites. Stewart said those
tests, which were completed Aug. 28, went smoothly and set the
stage for the missile-tracking test at Kwajalein.

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New Democratic Party ended a five-year
Liberal Party rule in Ontario and gained its first legislative
majority in elections in Canada's most populous province.
   The NDP stunned the Liberals by taking 74 of the 130 seats in
the legislature, knocking off Premier David Peterson and prominent
Cabinet members. ``We have an obligation to govern and provide
people with leadership . . . this was not a sneak attack. It was an
election, '' said NDP leader Bob Rae, who had an easy victory in
his Toronto district of York South in the Thursday elections.
   The Yukon territory has the only other government led by the New
Democratic Party, which supports a socialist platform.
   Ontario, which has about 6 million voters, has been ruled by the
Liberals since 1985.
   Peterson was defeated by New Democrat challenger Marion Boyd,
who runs a women's shelter in the district of London Center.
   Conservative leader Mike Harris held onto one of the few
northern Ontario seats the NDP did not seize. The Liberals retained
some pockets of support in eastern Ontario.
   Before the election, the Liberals held 93 seats; the New
Democrats 18, and the Conservatives 17. Two seats were vacant.
   The Liberals now control four provinces. The national Parliament
in Ottawa is dominated by the Conservatives.
   Public opinion polls released in the final week of the campaign
suggested a dramatic shift away from the Liberals in Ontario.
   Rae made the Liberal government's integrity a main campaign
issue, and the Liberals focused on constitutional reform.

<HEAD>Taxpayer Advocates Face Off With Western Mining Interests Over
Proposed Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 118-year-old federal mining law being
considered for an overhaul by Congress was criticized Thursday as a
taxpayer giveaway to business.
   Mining interests defended it, however, as necessary to the
discovery of new mineral resources.
   ``The law is obsolete,'' consumer advocate Ralph Nader told a
House subcommittee. ``It shows disrespect for taxpayer assets.'' He
called it a ``giveaway program.''
   Representing the miner's point of view, Donald Fife, a geologist
and chairman of the National Inholders Advisory Board, said ``a way
of life for hundreds of thousands of citizens and a national asset
for America would be destroyed by imprudent changes.''
   An inholder is a property owner whose land is surrounded by
government land.
   Cy Jamison, director of the Interior Department's Bureau of Land
Management, acknowledged that parts of the law need changing, but
said that in general it ``has worked well as an efficient and
predictable basis for one of the world's most successful hard rock
mining industries.''
   The three men were among 41 witnesses presenting opinions about
a bill introduced by Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W.Va., that would increase
fees to the government from prospecting for minerals on federal
land and make other changes.
   Rahall is chairman of the House Interior subcommittee on mining
and natural resources.
   An even more extensive bill, introduced by Sen. Dale Bumpers,
D-Ark., is pending in the Senate. However, congressional aides say
work on the legislation will not be completed in either body this
session.
   The 1872 law, frankly aimed at promoting mining, governs the
extraction on public lands of minerals such as gold, silver,
copper, lead and oil shale _ just about anything valuable except
coal, natural gas and liquid petroleum, resources that fall under
other laws and on which the government gets production royalties.
   The federal government is a major landholder throughout the
West, in some states owning a majority of all land.
   When Rahall introduced his bill, he said he was trying to
modernize ``some of the more archaic provisions of the law that
thwart efficient mineral exploration and development.''
   The proposed changes pit environmentalists and taxpayer interest
groups against the mining industry.
   Under the law, anyone may prospect and file a claim. The claim
gives the prospector exclusive rights to prospect and mine.
   To maintain the claim, the holder must perform $100 worth of
work every year _ a figure unchanged since 1872.
   Miners who can show that they have found valuable minerals and
have spent at least $500 on the claim may also _ but are not
required to _ acquire title to the mine land by paying the
government $2.50 or $5 per acre. The federal government has sold
3.2 million acres in this way since the law's enactment.
   Once the title is granted, the miner owns the land outright, and
there is no requirement that a mine be worked.
   The General Accounting Office, which does investigations for
Congress, found that 20 properties passing into private ownership
since 1970 were estimated in 1988 to be worth between $13.8 million
and $47.9 million. The federal government received less than $4,500
for the titles.
   Last week, the GAO reported that many holders were living
rent-free on claims while participating in unauthorized activities,
like storage of toxic chemicals and marijuana cultivation.
   Rahall's bill would require, among other things, that claim
holders pay rent to the government each year of $1.50 per acre _ $5
after the filing of a mining plan.
   Existing claims _ some have been outstanding for decades _ would
have to be converted to ownership or abandoned within three years.
   After mining is finished, the miner would have to restore the
land.

   The stamps, which have an eagle and shield insignia, were
introduced last fall on a test basis. They are peeled off a backing
sheet and can be applied to a letter without moisture.
   The stamps are sold in sheets of 16. They cost $4.50 per sheet

sold at face value of $4.00 per sheet for the servicemen and women
in the Gulf area, officials said.
   Officials said the stamps should be available by the middle of

   A man whose arm was bitten off by an
alligator in a national forest has been awarded $772,870 in damages
in his lawsuit against the federal government.
   U.S. District Judge Robert E. Varner of Montgomery ordered the
Forest Service to pay the money to Kermit H. George Jr. of Florala.
   George's arm was bitten of by a 500-pound, 11{-foot alligator on
July 26, 1986, while he was swimming in the Conecuh National
Forest, not far from his home near the Florida-Alabama line.
   In a ruling released Thursday, the judge awarded $655,200 for
George's pain and suffering. He was awarded $117,670 for medical
needs and other damages.
   The decision followed an April 30 ruling in which Varner found
that the Forest Service had failed to place signs warning of danger
despite having received complaints about alligators in the national
forest.
   He rejected government claims that George encouraged the attack
by allowing his dog to run unleashed into the pond in violation of
national forest rules. The judge acknowledged that alligators
``enjoy dog meat,'' but added that they ``are not discriminatory in
their tastes and are well known to dine on whatever is convenient.''
   George, who was 42 at the time, was an experienced electronics
engineer who also did land surveying and construction consulting
part time. He had been riding his bicycle and had stopped at a
roped-off swimming area to cool off. He was in chest-deep water
when he was attacked.

   The judge in the Bensonhurst racial murder case
ruled Friday that the two white defendants should stand trial
together but with separate juries deciding their fates.
   Prosecutors wanted John Vento, 21, and Charles Stressler, 22,
tried before a single panel, arguing that the cases were similar
enough and would save time and money if tried before a single panel.
   Stressler's lawyer, Jacob B. Evseroff, asked Justice Thaddeus
Owens of the trial-level state Supreme Court for two juries,
arguing that Vento's earlier conviction in the case might prejudice
the panel against Stressler.
   Owens overruled assistant District Attorney Douglas Nadjari and
scheduled jury selection on Stressler's case for Sept. 17 and on
Sept. 24 for Vento.
   Vento was acquitted in July of one second-degree murder charge
in the case, but the jury deadlocked on a second murder count and a
riot charge. He will be retried on those two charges and an added,
second-degree manslaughter count.
   Vento was convicted on two counts of unlawful imprisonment and
four counts of menacing and is serving a sentence of two and
two-thirds to eight years.
   Stressler faces trial on numerous counts, including
second-degree murder, first- and second-degree manslaughter,
assault, riot and other crimes.
   Both face 25 years to life if convicted of murder.
   Vento and Stressler are charged in the Aug. 23, 1989, racially
motivated slaying of Yusuf Hawkins, 16, who was fatally shot when
he and three friends were attacked by a white mob in Brooklyn's
Bensonhurst district.
   Two other whites accused of participating in the killing, Joseph
Fama and Keith Mondello, were tried together before separate
juries, convicted and are in jail.
   Fama, who fired the gun, was found guilty of second-degree
murder and other crimes. Mondello, the ringleader, was acquitted of
murder, but convicted of several lesser crimes, including riot and
unlawful imprisonment.
   Four other young white men are to stand trial later.

   Kuwait's ousted royal rulers pledged $5 billion
Friday to support the U.S.-led campaign against Iraq, urging the
United States to set a deadline for ending negotiations with Saddam
Hussein.
   ``Kuwaitis inside Kuwait are living a nightmare,'' said Yahya al
Sumait, the designated spokesman for the ousted royal family. He
said peaceful measures were unlikely to resolve the crisis.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the United States
would not ``foreclose any actions, but we are not going to put any
deadline there.''
   Emir Jabar al-Sabah offered the $5 billion to Baker at a meeting
in Taif, Saudi Arabia, where the monarch has taken refuge.
   Half the money would help defray the $6 billion the United
States anticipates spending on its military defense of the Saudi
oilfields by year's end. The other half would go to countries such
as Turkey and Egypt, which are suffering economic hardships because
of the United Nations embargo of Iraq.
   Also Friday, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady won a pledges
from Japan and South Korea to increase their support for the
operation. However, no specifics were discussed.
   Baker, here for talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
said he was pleased with the Kuwaiti offer, which followed an
unspecified pledge Thursday night of several billion dollars from
King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.
   ``Their attitude was very, very forthcoming,'' Baker said of the
Kuwaitis, whose rule of nearly 250 years was swept aside in Iraq's
lightning Aug. 2 invasion of the Persian Gulf oil state.
   Baker also said Sheik Zayid bin Sultan al Nahyan, president of
the United Arab Emirates, took ``a very positive and constructive
attitude'' when the aid issue was raised at a meeting Friday in
sun-baked Abu Dhabi.
   However, Baker told reporters he didn't receive ``a final
number'' from the United Arab Emirates, a federation of seven
emirates, which also is protected by U.S. warplanes.
   The Kuwaitis took an especially tough line toward Iraq, which
seized the oil-rich country in a bitter dispute that challenges
Kuwait's right to survive as a nation.
   Al Sumait, the Kuwaiti spokesman, said a deadline should be set
for a negotiated settlement after which military action may be
needed to expel the Iraqi invaders.
   ``We don't want to speak of any military action for the time
being,'' he said. ``Knowing this man (Saddam) and knowing his
actions and his intentions, I don't believe that peaceful actions
will end in any result.''
   Asked when the deadline should be imposed, al Sumait said: ``If
it were up to me, I would like to see it tomorrow.''
   Earlier Friday, Baker went to the Saudi desert to visit a hanger
built to resist a chemical weapons attack and house part of the
U.S. war machine.
   ``We have weapons, we have guns, we have our crew chiefs, we are
ready to go,'' Lt. Col. Tommy Crawford, 41, of Roswell, N.M., said
as he stood in front of the camouflaged F111 fighter plane that
bombed Libya in 1986.
   The plane is being prepared to attack Baghdad should the Persian
Gulf crisis come to that. Alongside was another version of the
F111, equipped with jamming devices, from Home Air Force Base,
Idaho.
   The location of the base is a matter of national security and
reporters accompanying Baker were told to say only that it is
somewhere in western Saudi Arabia.
   From the distance, the hangar looks somewhat like a sand dune,
giving no hint of the firepower inside.

<TEXT>
   Charges will be dropped against 65 Haitians
arrested when riot police used nightsticks to disperse protesters
demonstrating against a clothing store, the state attorney's office
said Friday.
   ``The disputed facts and claims of self-defense make it
impossible to prove a criminal charge against anyone beyond and to
the exclusion of a reasonable doubt,'' Assistant State Attorney
Jerald Bagley wrote in a memo.
   Charges also will be dropped against four other Haitians
arrested outside the Rapid Transit Factory Outlet a week earlier,
after a fight between a Haitian customer and the son of the store's
owner.
   ``By dropping the charges, we are getting one step closer to
reuniting the community,'' said Philippe Brutus, an attorney for
several of those arrested. ``To prosecute would have added salt to
the wounds.''
   Haitians long have claimed they are discriminated against in
immigration policy because their political asylum requests
routinely are rejected and boatloads of refugees intercepted by the
Coast Guard are returned to Haiti.
   Store owner Luis Reyes said State Attorney Janet Reno told him
of the decision not to prosecute anyone in a telephone call Tuesday.
   The controversy began with a June 29 fistfight at the store
between customer Abner Alezi and Joe Reyes, the 16-year-old son of
the owner, Luis Reyes.
   After police arrested Alezi and three others on trespassing
charges, 200 demonstrators clustered around the store in a six-hour
standoff. More than 500 demonstrators showed up at the store the
next day.
   On July 5, as television cameras rolled during a third protest,
police beat several demonstrators and arrested 65 people to
disperse the crowd that refused to leave the shopping center in
Miami's Little Haiti neighborhood.

<TEXT>
   A.J.P. Taylor, Britain's most popular historian,
died Friday after a long battle with Parkinson's disease. He was 84.
   Taylor, who pundits said was a historian who saw history as more
muddle than ideology, wrote at least 30 books of history and
biography.
   Taylor, given to humorous expressions and a bow tie, gained
audiences of millions through plain-spoken journalism and riveting
television lectures on the Russian Revolution and other modern
conflicts. He often stood before the camera without notes or
teleprompter, talking nonstop for up to an hour.
   Taylor's history stressed the importance of what he called ``the
irrational, the unpredictable and the unique,'' and said his
historical philosophy was ``things happen because they happen.''
   Said Michael Foot, former leader of the opposition Labor Party,
``No one ever knew better how to spur the excitement of history.''
   Taylor's study of history in a 60-year career convinced him that
events are often shaped by accident. His argument that Adolf Hitler
was an opportunist who did not plan World War II but blundered into
it caused international controversy.
   Other historians denounced Taylor's stand, put forward in his
1961 book, ``The Origins of the Second World War,'' but Taylor said
a historian must write without preconceptions and on the basis of
events as they happened.
   ``I set out with the firm conviction inherited from my pre-war
years, that Hitler planned the war,'' Taylor wrote later.
   ``I discovered, or thought I discovered, that Hitler, though no
doubt resolved to make Germany a world power, had no clear-cut plan
how to do it and moved forward with the changing situation. Some
critics were shocked by this and attributed to me all kinds of
wickedness _ apologizing for Hitler or justifying the later
appeasement of Soviet Russia.
   ``I had no such aims. My historian's conscience simply carried
me in an unexpected direction. I do not think any historian is
worth his salt who has not had a similar experience.''
   Taylor participated in events as well as writing about them. A
lifelong radical, he was briefly a Communist Party member in 1926
but then joined the Labor Party. He marched for the campaign for
nuclear disarmament.
   In his 1983 autobiography, ``A Personal History,'' he defined
his politics as ``extreme views weakly held.''
   His most enduring book is ``English History 1914-1945'' in the
Oxford History of England series.
   Taylor put in his 600-page account often curious footnotes
describing actors on the political stage, including:
   ``King George V, 1865-1936, second son of Edward VII: married
Princess Mary of Teck, 1893; king, 1910-36; changed name of royal
family from Saxe-Coburg to Windsor, 1917; his trousers were creased
at the sides, not front and back.''
   Taylor wrote that the abdication of King Edward VIII in 1936 was
``an event of no historical importance'' and described Sir Winston
Churchill as the ``savior of his country, the first Englishman to
be so hailed since Alfred the Great,'' the Anglo-Saxon ruler who
died 1,000 years ago.
   Historian David Marquand said Taylor's English history was ``a
story of muddle, folly and incompetence in high places, redeemed
only by the patience, courage and decency of ordinary people.''
   Alan John Percivale Taylor was born March 25, 1906, in Birkdale,
Lancashire, the son of a cotton manufacturer. He studied at Oxford
University and became a lecturer there in international history and
modern and English history.
   Taylor's lively skill in turning history books into bestsellers
won the favor of Canadian newspaper magnate Lord Beaverbrook, who
gave him a platform in his mass-circulation Sunday Express.
   That and the popularity of Taylor's books, such as ``Struggle
for Mastery in Europe,'' aroused the antipathy of academics,
particularly J.C. Masterman, warden of New College, Oxford. In the
1950s, Masterman and others blocked Taylor from receiving an Oxford
Chair of Modern History and then prevented him from becoming Regius
Professor of Modern History at Oxford.
   Taylor is survived by four sons and two daughters from two
marriages, and by his third wife, Hungarian historian Eva Haraszti.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

<TEXT>
   While allowing American women and children to
leave, Iraqi authorities are continuing to round up American men
and now have almost 90 in detention, the State Department said
Friday.
   Spokesman Mark Dillen said the latest addition to the list was
an American man picked up Thursday in Kuwait with his non-American
wife. He was subsequently taken to Baghdad.
   ``We have not been told where our citizens have been taken, and
we have not been granted, with a small number of exceptions to the
contrary, any consular access,'' Dillen said.
   Many of the Americans are believed to have been taken to
military or industrial installations as ``human shields'' to deter
against a potential American military attack on Iraq.
   Some 165 Americans, virtually all women and children, flew out
of Kuwait on Friday and an additional evacuation is scheduled for
Saturday. After the Saturday charter, the number of stranded
Americans in Iraq and Kuwait will have fallen below 2,200, U.S.
officials estimate.
   Dillen said the Iraqis have provided no additional information
about an American who was shot by an Iraqi soldier earlier this
week while trying to evade capture, the first incident of its kind
since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Iraqi authorities told U.S. envoys on Thursday the man was not
wounded seriously and was expected to be released shortly from a
hospital.

   A Titan 4 missile blew up
at a rocket test site Friday, killing one person, leaving one
missing and sending up a huge mushroom cloud over the desert,
authorities said.
   The Titan 4 booster rocket exploded at the testing laboratory at
about 10:45 a.m., said Staff Sgt. Thomas Morgan.
   The blast left one person dead and one missing, said Lt. Col.
Rick Oborn, a spokesman at the Pentagon.
   Oborn said an initial report from the scene indicated that the
blast was due to the explosion of ``one of the stages of a Titan
missile booster.''
   The spokesman said one of the rocket's stages was being moved,
was somehow dislodged or dropped, and exploded upon impact.
   ``It appears to have been one of the solid fuel sections'' of
the booster, Oborn said.
   The resulting plume was moving away from populated areas at an
altitude that posed no immediate threat to residents, Morgan said.
   ``There was a big cloud of smoke. It was really bright,'' said
Roberta Martinson, clerk at a convenience store in Boron.
   Base officials contacted the California Highway Patrol, which
closed a 30-mile stretch of Highway 58. The road, which runs across
the north side of the base, was reopened a short time later.
   There were no evacuations of the area, 70 miles northeast of Los
Angeles, said Capt. Chris Angelo of the Kern County Fire
Department's Boron station.
   ``It was high enough that we felt it wouldn't come down,''
Angelo said.
   Titan 4s, built by Martin Marietta Corp., are considered the Air
Force's primary booster for launching its heavy payloads into space.
   The second Titan 4 built, worth $173 million, was launched June
8 from Cape Canaveral, Fla., carrying a secret surveillance
satellite into orbit. The first was launched on June 14, 1989,
boosting what analysts said was either a missile-warning satellite
or an electronic eavesdropping satellite.
   Ten launches had been planned during 1990-91, but six were
postponed because of delays in preparing launch sites and taking
delivery of the rockets. As of June, the Air Force said it planned
two more Titan 4 launches this year.
   The Pentagon also has said it plans to launch 10 Titan 4s
annually by 1995.
   The Air Force initially planned to build only 10 Titan 4s to
complement the space shuttle as a way to launch heavy payloads. But
the 1986 explosion that destroyed the shuttle Challenger and killed
seven crew members prompted the Pentagon to decide to obtain many
more.
   The shuttle can put a 52,000-pound payload into orbit. The Titan
4, which stands 20 stories tall, can lift a 39,000-pound cargo into
low Earth orbit or a 10,000-pound payload to a fixed orbit 22,300
miles high.
   As of June, the Air Force had let contracts for construction of
41 Titan 4s, and had funds available for nine more. The service
planned to procure 100 Titan 4s by the year 2000.

   Police said Friday they arrested a man they
believe is the ``sexual sadist'' who raped eight women, killing
four of them, in a series of attacks that terrorized Moscow's
northern neighborhoods.
   Deputy Police Chief Maj. Gen. A. Bugayev told the Soviet evening
television news program ``Vremya'' the man was captured after being
identified by a woman who survived an attack.
   Bugayev refused to identify the suspect, but said he had a long
criminal record, including six previous convictions, and lived in
Moscow after being recently released from prison.
   The Moscow City Council had offered a reward of 10,000 rubles _
about $16,000 _ for help in apprehending the man who stalked the
Timiryazevsky district of northern Moscow since July 13, the
newspaper Moskovskaya Pravda reported.
   Police said the killer would surprise his victims by jumping
from behind bushes brandishing a knife.
   Four of the rape victims were stabbed to death. It was not
disclosed how the four survivors managed to escape.
   ``He was a sexual sadist. He never stole anything,'' Bugayev
said. ``He left all their jewelry and only removed rings from some
of them.''

   Jesse Jackson met the Iraqi ambassador Friday
and said the stage was set for an ``airlift of significant
proportions'' of American citizens from Iraq and occupied Kuwait.
   In addition, Jackson urged the United States to honor
humanitarian requests that milk and food for Iraqi children be
exempted from economic sanctions, and he called for more
communication with Baghdad.
   ``If the diplomatic initiative now begins to match the military
initiative, just maybe we can be spared of the ugliest scenario,''
Jackson said.
   ``We must give honorable peace every possible chance,'' said the
civil rights activist and former Democratic presidential contender.
   Jackson acknowledged after an 80-minute meeting with Iraqi
Ambassador Mohamed al-Mashat that he had received no promises that
American men could join women and children now being allowed to
return home.
   American and other Western men are being seized by Iraqi
authorities and moved to strategic installations to discourage
military attacks.
   Jackson met Iraq's President Saddam Hussein in Baghdad last week
and won his approval to escort home 47 American hostages.
   ``What was a trickle is now beginning to look like an airlift of
significant proportions,'' he said.
   A U.S.-chartered Iraqi airliner Friday carried 165 Americans
stranded in Kuwait to Amman, Jordan. State Department spokesman
Mark Dillen said a second flight of Americans will reach Amman from
Kuwait on Saturday, and that additional charters are being planned.
   Asked if Iraq would allow the flights to continue, Jackson said,
``That was the impression. I didn't get the impression there was
`a' flight.''
   Al-Mashat said Iraq had taken the initiative to ``show the world
our good will,'' but complained that the United States had failed
to reciprocate with a similar act to ease tensions.

<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican U.S. Senate candidate Lynn
Martin is willing to dip into her campaign funds to reimburse
people confused by a national GOP group's fund-raising appeal, her
campaign says.
   Martin, a five-term House member who is challenging Democratic
Sen. Paul Simon, joined other top Illinois Republicans in
questioning a recent mailing of $25 ``checks'' by the National
Republican Senatorial Committee. The committee helps elect
Republicans to the Senate.
   Cashing one of the checks authorizes the committee to withdraw
$12.50 a month from the recipient's checking account. Fine print on
the back of each check says the person endorsing it also is
authorizing the automatic electronic transfer of funds.
   The fund-raising letter was mailed to 700,000 people nationwide.
   Martin campaign spokeswoman Kathy Lydon said Thursday that
Martin sent the GOP committee a letter encouraging it to use a
larger disclaimer and to live up to its pledge of a money-back
guarantee to dissatisfied donors.
   Ms. Lydon said the Martin campaign fund would reimburse anyone
who does not quickly obtain a refund sought from the national
senatorial committee.
   GOP gubernatorial candidate Jim Edgar said he disagreed with the
way the committee solicited funds and said it should have made a
more direct appeal for contributions.
   Republican Gov. James R. Thompson also criticized the letter,
saying: ``If you want to ask people for money, simply ask them for
money.''
   Wendy Burnley, a spokeswoman for the Republican senatorial
committee in Washington, defended the appeal for funds as ``fairly
straightforward.''

   Democratic Sen. Bennett Johnston was
supported by 48 percent of those surveyed on Louisiana's U.S.
Senate race, just shy of the 50 percent share needed to avoid a
runoff after the Oct. 6 primary.
   The survey found maverick Republican David Duke, a former Ku
Klux Klan leader, was supported by 28 percent and state Sen. Ben
Bagert, the GOP's endorsed candidate, by 11 percent. Thirteen
percent were undecided.
   The telephone poll of 823 registered voters was conducted Sunday
through Wednesday by Mason-Dixon Opinion Research of Columbia, Md.,
for Gannett News Service and a consortium of television stations.
The margin of error was plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
   Among white voters, Duke was supported by 37 percent of those
surveyed, compared to 36 percent for Johnston and 14 percent for
Bagert. Four out of every five black voters favored Johnston,
according to the poll.
   J. Brad Coker, president of Mason-Dixon, said Duke's support had
risen from a May poll when he was supported by 21 percent of those
surveyed.
   ``The conventional wisdom has been that Duke has started to
slip, but he is up to 28 percent now,'' Coker said. ``I don't know
if people are necessarily voting for him or voting for him to show
their discontent.''

   Less than two days after recapturing
his party's nomination, Republican Gov. Bob Martinez launched a
television commercial tweaking his Democratic rival for retiring
from the U.S. Senate.
   ``Bob Martinez never quits and walks away,'' the ad says, a
reference to Lawton Chiles' decision in 1987 not to seek
re-election to the Senate.
   Julie Fletcher, a spokeswoman for the Chiles campaign, said
Martinez was picking up on a negative theme that backfired on U.S.
Rep. Bill Nelson in his attempt to defeat Chiles in the Democratic
primary.
   ``I think it's also (a) not-so-thinly veiled slap at Lawton for
walking away from the Senate,'' she said.
   The 30-second commercial, touting Martinez as offering
``leadership you can count on,'' debuted statewide Thursday. It
portrays the governor as a fighter and leader who can be counted
on, although it acknowledges that he hasn't won all his fights.
   ``To the extent his endurance and his being a fighter contrasts
favorably with Lawton having quit the Senate, that's a plus, but
not the purpose of the ad,'' said J.M. ``Mac'' Stipanovich,
campaign manager for Martinez.

   Democratic Sen. Claiborne Pell leads his
GOP challenger, Rep. Claudine Schneider, by 12 percentage points,
according to a survey of likely voters in Rhode Island's U.S.
Senate race.
   The survey by Alpha Research Associates showed Pell leading Ms.
Schneider 52 percent to 40 percent, with 6 percent unsure. Both had
picked up support since an Alpha poll in May, when Pell led
Schneider 49 percent to 38 percent.
   The latest random survey of 511 likely general-election voters,
released Thursday, was conducted by telephone Aug. 22-29 and had a
margin of error of 4 percentage points.
   Schneider's camp said it was encouraged that Pell's lead wasn't
larger, given his long tenure in Congress.
   ``He is chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and has a
high profile in this (Middle East) crisis, and barely at 50 percent
is a good sign,'' said Schneider campaign spokesman Robert Rendine.
   Pell campaign spokesman Richard Gureghian said the survey was
conducted before Pell's trip to the Middle East and he stressed
that Schneider herself was an incumbent member of Congress.
   ``This is an incumbent senator running against a congresswoman
of 10 years with statewide recognition,'' Gureghian said.

<BYLINE>By EVE EPSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WESTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Edward Bowles, an electrical engineer and
microwave specialist who played a key role in spurring Allied
development of radar technology in World War II, has died at age 92.
   Bowles, who died Wednesday, had suffered from Parkinson's diease
and a series of strokes, his family said.
   During the war, Bowles worked as a consultant to Secretary of
War Henry Stimson and became a liaison between Washington and radar
scientists working at the Radiation Laboratory at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
   Bowles, who specialized in microwave technology at MIT, set up a
laboratory at Langley Field, Va., where Army Air Corps bombers were
equipped with MIT-developed radar.
   British scientists were first to develop radar, based on the
theories of James Clerk Maxwell, a British mathematician and
physicist, who predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves
that travel at the speed of light.
   In 1935, the British has developed pulse techniques to locate
aircraft up to 17 miles away. By 1940, England's ground-based radar
stations were a decisive element in winning the Battle of Britain.
   But in 1944, Germany began attacking London with its jet-powered
``buzz bombs'' _ the first cruise missile _ and the British asked
for U.S. help.
   Langley had developed ground-based systems that could ``track an
airplane or buzz bomb by radar, plot its course and then tell the
guns where to point and shoot, in order to have the best chance of
hitting the target,'' said Albert Hill, 80, a former Radiation Lab
scientist and MIT professor.
   Bowles then bypassed regulations that would have delayed the
shipment of necessary equipment.
   ``We were loading the requisite materials on ships the next
morning,'' Bowles recalled in an interview with the Washington
University Magazine a decade ago. ``The result was that thereafter
we destroyed above 90 percent of the buzz bombs.''
   A native of Westphalia, Mo., Bowles received his bachelor's
degree from Washington University in St. Louis and a master's from
MIT, where he began teaching in 1921.
   Bowles pioneered the development of a method for maintaining a
precise radio frequency, using a tuning fork. He began a division
of electrical communications at MIT in the mid-1920s.
   In 1945, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for his
wartime service, an honor usually reserved for military personnel.

   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and Secretary of State James
A. Baker III solicited the promises on separate global fund-raising
expeditions.
   They were seeking support for an American plan that needs more
than $25 billion to defray the costs of the U.S. troop buildup and
to provide emergency economic relief to countries hurt by the
U.N.-sponsored trade sanctions against Iraq.
   Administration officials returning to the United States after
Brady's four-day whirlwind trip were upbeat about the chances of
ultimate success, although one conceded that full acceptance of the
plan ``might take a little longer than we had hoped.''
   In Saudi Arabia, Kuwait's ousted royal rulers pledged $5
billion, while one U.S. official said Japan was being asked for
``billions of dollars.''
   None of the other world leaders Brady lobbied this week provided
any specifics on what they would pledge, saying in most cases that
they needed more time to review the request.
   ``Our principal message throughout this trip has been that there
is a cost which all must share in maintaining a freely flowing
source of oil at a price determined by market forces,'' Brady said.
   The United States estimates it will cost about $1 billion a
month to keep American troops in the Mideast, with $10.5 billion
urgently needed to alleviate serious hardships in Jordan, Egypt and
Turkey.
   Brady met for about an hour with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu as
he tried to persuade Japan to contribute more than the $1 billion
package of military support it already has pledged.
   ``I think Japan will not disappoint you,'' Japanese Foreign
Ministry spokesman Yukio Okamoto said after the meeting, but
offered no specifics.
   In Saudi Arabia, Kuwait's exiled monarch, Jabir al-Sabah, said:
``We will not spare any amount or any value. We will give whatever
is necessary.''
   Al-Sabah's regime already has pledged to compensate Turkey for
losses of up to $2 billion from the shutdown of an Iraqi oil
pipeline and the exiled leader also said his government would
contribute to the cost of the American military buildup.
   But a spokesman for the Kuwaiti royal family also urged the
United States to set a deadline for ending negotiations with Saddam
Hussein.
   Baker said the United States would not ``foreclose any actions,
but we are not going to put any deadline there.''
   On Thursday, Saudi Arabia promised several billion dollars
toward the operation protecting the kingdom's oil fields from Iraqi
aggression.
   Al-Sabah, Kaifu and South Korean President Roh Tae-woo joined
French officials and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in
promising to help pay the costs of the military operation.
   Brady said he was pleased with the endorsements from Japan and
South Korea.
   Before Brady arrived, Japan announced it would provide an
additional $12 million to assist the thousands of refugees fleeing
the Middle East and repeated a pledge to provide direct economic
assistance to countries hard hit by the trade embargo.
   Officials traveling with Brady, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said the total being sought from Japan was higher than
$2 billion, with one official saying the request was for ``billions
of dollars.''
   A third American official said the Japanese had a lot of
questions about how the money would be used, but added he
``wouldn't be surprised if we got very close'' to the figure being
sought.
   Brady met earlier Friday with Roh in Seoul, South Korea, amid
reports that country is reluctant to commit significant resources
against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein because officials fear
jeopardizing construction contracts in Iraq and Kuwait worth more
than $1 billion.
   At a news conference in Seoul, Brady said Roh raised those
concerns in a ``tangential way.'' Brady said he pointed out the
huge stake South Korea has in keeping the price of oil from
escalating.
   ``Every $10 increase in the price of a barrel of oil means a
$2.5 billion cost to the Korean economy,'' Brady said.
   He said a similar increase would cost the Japanese economy
nearly $20 billion.

<HEAD>Northern Ireland Man Shot to Death in Bed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>

   Intruders shot and killed a man
Friday while he was in bed, police said.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary said the 34-year-old Catholic man
died soon after he was shot five times in the head and body by at
least two assailants. His girlfriend was in bed with him at the
time of the shooting, police said.
   The man's companion, her two children and a friend spending the
night at the south Belfast house were unharmed, police said.
   Police detectives said the dead man, identified as Emmanuel
Shields, had no connection to the security forces, and they were
afraid the killing was a random attack by Protestant loyalists.
   On Wednesday, the outlawed Ulster Freedom Fighters threatened to
kill Catholic workers after the Irish Republican Army shot and
wounded two men on their way to work in County Tyrone.
   The Apprentice Boys of Derry, meanwhile, said the Rev. Ian
Paisley and four others had been expelled from the group, a major
Northern Ireland Protestant organization, because they publicly
opposed asking for money from a fund set up under the Anglo-Irish
agreement, to build a heritage center.
   The 1985 Anglo-Irish accord angered some of the leaders of
Northern Ireland's Protestant majority by giving the Roman Catholic
Irish Republic a consultative role in the administration of the
British province.
   Derek Miller, general secretary of the Apprentice Boys, said the
five men had broken the rules of the 9,000-member loyalist
organization of clubs, which commemorate Protestants shutting the
gates of Londonderry to the advancing Catholic King James in 1688.
   Paisley, a Democratic Unionist Party member of Parliament, was
unavailable for comment though an appeal was expected.

<HEAD>Sherburne Says Humphrey Splitting GOP For Personal Gain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANK BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The little-known state representative
battling political giant Gordon Humphrey for a state Senate
nomination charged Friday that Humphrey is splitting the party for
personal political gain.
   Jack Sherburne said Humphrey, who is retiring from the U.S.
Senate and running for the New Hampshire Senate, has fragmented the
party with his ultraconservative views and call for a tax revolt.
   ``He is the would-be head of a maverick Republican wing with
little or no social conscience,'' Sherburne said at a news
conference. ``He is so conservative that he has held himself aloof
from the Republicans in Congress and been largely ineffective as a
U.S. senator.''
   Humphrey, 49, is known as a maverick. During his 12 years in
Washington, he has often clashed with Republican congressional
leaders because of his strong views. He gave up almost certain
re-election to stick to a campaign promise that he would serve no
more than two terms in Washington.
   Sherburne said he believes Humphrey wants to use the state
Senate as a springboard to run for governor and, eventually,
president.
   ``He's got a national agenda in mind,'' Sherburne said. ``He's
the darling of the ultraconservatives and that's the role he's
playing. He's staying in government to become governor and then run
for president.''
   Humphrey has said he is interested in becoming governor, but
that he wouldn't challenge his friend, Gov. Judd Gregg. He hasn't
mentioned presidential aspirations. A call to Humphrey's Washington
office for comment was not immediately returned Friday.
   Due in large part to his greater name recognition, Humphrey is
favored in Tuesday's primary. But observers say an upset is
possible, in part because the candidates differ sharply on abortion.
   Humphrey is one of the Senate's staunchest opponents of legal
abortion, while Sherburne is pro-choice.
   Sherburne said Humphrey's call for a tax revolt in New Hampshire
is ridiculous. He said New Hampshire already ranks among the lowest
states in per capita taxation, while its personal income is among
the highest.
   ``Here comes Gordon Humphrey, the former Virginia Democrat, a
converted extremist from Washington who wants a tax revolt. A
revolt against what?'' Sherburne asked.

   A judge on Friday sentenced two peace
campaigners to 15 months in jail for damaging a U.S. Air Force
fighter bomber.
   The campaigners were found guilty Tuesday of causing $475,000
damage when they hammered an F-111 with mallets at the Upper
Heyford air base.
   Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark wrote to Judge Francis
Allen opposing a prison sentence.
   ``The law cannot punish conscience and only hurts itself when it
tries,'' he said. ``We must hope there will always be people with
the courage and selflessness to risk their very freedom to warn
society when they believe it is endangering itself.''
   Stephen Hancock, a 24-year-old poet and publisher, and Michael
Hutchinson, a 35-year-old musician, are members of the Swords Into
Ploughshares anti-nuclear peace group.
   They said they were acting on behalf of the survival of the
human race. The men were wearing large Mickey Mouse ears and
T-shirts when they were arrested hammering the plane March 21.
   Allen said everyone hated the thought of using nuclear weapons.
   ``Since they first darkened the world, men and women have
debated whether they should be permissible. As a matter of
conscience you argue they should not and many agree, but many, no
doubt reluctantly, do not agree.
   ``We live in a democracy, as do the Americans, and in a
democracy the right way to deal with matters of conscience as law
abides is through argument and the ballot box and not by causing
damage to property.''

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Blast Midwest, Parts of East; Nome Freezes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Powerful thunderstorms pounded large parts of the Midwest and
East on Friday, swelling rivers and causing flooding in several
states. Nome, Alaska, recorded its first freezing temperatures of
the season.
   The thunderstorms developed during the afternoon along and ahead
of a cold front curving through the Ohio Valley. Showers and
thunderstorms extended from eastern Kansas through central Illinois
to the upper Ohio Valley.
   There also were thunderstorms in Pennsylvania, New York and
parts of New England.
   Ohio was particularly hard hit by the flooding, with many
communities receiving more than 3 inches of rain in 24 hours. At
Steubenville, where more than 5 inches of rain sent the Ohio River
over its banks, floodwaters were as deep as 10 feet in places.
   Flooding was also reported in Michigan, Pennsylvania and West
Virginia. Nearly 2 inches of rain fell in Pittsburgh, breaking the
record for the date.
   Thunderstorms in central Indiana produced hail an inch in
diameter at Thorntown, northwest of Indianapolis.
   A few showers and thunderstorms also were reported in Missouri,
Arkansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Colorado.
   Isolated showers and thunderstorms dotted the Gulf Coast. A few
light showers fell in western Washington state, western Oregon and
northeastern Nevada.
   Sunny, dry weather prevailed across most of the rest of the
nation, with haze in the Southeast and along the Middle Atlantic
Coast.
   Temperatures warmed into the 90s across much of the area from
the southern and central Plains to the southern half of the
Atlantic Coast.
   Readings were only in the 60s from northern Minnesota through
much of Michigan and northern New England.
   In the West, temperatures ranged from the upper 60s to lower 80s
in the Pacific Northwest, and into the 90s in the desert Southwest.
   The nation's low Friday was 37 degrees at West Yellowstone, Mont.
   At Nome, summery weather came to an end when the mercury dipped
to freezing for the first time since June 11. The first freeze in
Nome typically occurs by Aug. 18, although last year it didn't
occur until Oct. 5.

   A band of thunderstorms from Michigan to Pennsylvania unleashed
high winds and driving rains, flooding Ohio River communities with
as much as 10 feet of water Friday and disrupting flights from the
nation's busiest airport.
   The storms were blamed for the deaths of five people.
   Hundreds of residents fled their homes in Steubenville, Ohio,
and across the Ohio River in Follansbee, W.Va., because of flooding
Thursday night and Friday. The North Ohio Valley Air Authority
reported 5.71 inches of rain fell in 24 hours in Steubenville in
eastern Ohio. Schools were closed Friday.
   ``I lived down here 15 years, and I've never seen anything like
this before,'' Jessica Keifer of Steubenville said.
   Ms. Keifer said she lost a washer and dryer, a motorcycle, pool
table, a friend's furniture she had been storing, her television
and all of her winter clothes.
   United Airlines said it canceled 50 percent of its Friday
afternoon flights out of Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.
Three Chicago-bound flights were canceled out of Washington's
National Airport, and three others delayed earlier in the day, a
United spokesman said. One Chicago-bound flight was delayed 4{
hours.
   Some southbound flights out of O'Hare had to be diverted as far
east as Iowa City before they could start turning south, in order
to get around the storms, said Don Zochert, a Federal Aviation
Administration spokesman in Chicago.
   A sailboat caught in the storm Thursday on Lake Erie crashed
into a breakwater near Cleveland harbor and broke into pieces.
Three women aboard were killed; three men were rescued.
   The boaters were whipped so hard by 36 mph winds and 6-foot
waves that their clothes had been torn off, Coast Guard Lt. Vincent
Weber said.
   In eastern Ohio, a 50-year-old woman was struck by lightning and
killed as she ran for shelter through a farm field near Wilmot, and
another woman died in a two-car accident in Warren blamed on a
power outage caused by the storm.
   Power outages were also reported in southern Michigan and West
Virginia.
   The Allegheny Creek in West Virginia ran out of its banks,
flooding about a dozen businesses with up to 6 feet of water and
submerging cars in Follansbee. About 40 homes were evacuated in the
town of about 4,000.
   ``I can't believe it actually floated cars,'' said Fire Chief
Larry Rea.
   Up to 300 residents left their homes in Steubenville, said
George Starliper, Jefferson County Emergency Services Director.
   Steubenville Mayor Dave Hindman gave lower figures, saying about
30 people went to an emergency shelter during the night and an
equal number stayed with relatives.
   About one-third of the evacuees would be allowed to return home
Friday, but others will have to wait, said Jim Ferris, the city
building inspector. At least 20 of the most heavily damaged homes
would need inspections, he said.
   The National Weather Service said floodwaters in Steubenville
were as high as 10 feet.
   In western Pennsylvania, Plum Creek overflowed about 20 miles
southwest of Pittsburgh, flooding the business district in Houston
with up to 10 feet of water. One hundred residents of Avella were
evacuated, said Washington County Emergency Services Director
Bracken Burns.
   Tornadoes knocked down trees in Pennsylvania's Butler County and
Westmoreland County, the weather service said. Other unconfirmed
tornado sightings were reported in Michigan and Ohio.
   Winds knocked over a tarp at a softball complex in Rochester
Hills, north of Detroit, injuring seven people, one critically.
   Winds ripped the roof off a feed store in Chesterfield Township,
north of Detroit.
   ``The power went off, there was a loud whistling noise, then _
blam! It took the roof off,'' said employee Jerry Scopas, the only
person in the store at the time. ``It only lasted about 15 seconds,
then the roof was gone. It's all laying out front in the parking
lot.''
   The body of the third victim of the Ohio boating accident was
found in Lake Erie on Friday morning. The 26-foot boat had radioed
the Coast Guard for an escort into a Cleveland marina because of
the high water and strong winds, said Coast Guard spokesman Phillip
Franklin.
   ``By the time our boat arrived on the scene, the sailboat had
broken in two, and the mast had collapsed,'' Franklin said.
   One of the rescued crew members, William Alston, said the boat
got pushed up on the rocky breakwall before it broke apart.
   ``Like any accident, some people were in the wrong place at the
wrong time. The boat broke up really fast,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dentist With AIDS Dies; Former Patient Pursues Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 22-year-old woman apparently
infected with AIDS while getting a tooth pulled urged stricter
control of the health care industry Friday, the same day her
dentist's death was revealed.
   David Johnson Acer, 40, of Stuart, died Monday of acquire immune
deficiency syndrome, but his family ``waited to make this
announcement so they could privately grieve,'' lawyer Deborah
Sawyer said. She refused to elaborate.
   On Tuesday, the state Health Department released a letter Acer
wrote to former patients urging them to be tested for the deadly
virus.
   Meanwhile, the patient Acer is accused of infecting came forward
Friday to urge stricter regulation of the health care industry.
Kimberly Bergalis, 22, of Fort Pierce, said she would sue the late
dentist's estate and her own insurance company for malpractice.
   ``What we've gone through is an injustice,'' said Ms. Bergalis,
who in earlier court papers revealed only her initials. ``If this
can be prevented, if new guidelines can be established to prevent
this from happening again, then I think that's what needs to be
done.''
   The national Centers for Disease Control reported last month
that Ms. Bergalis' case marked the first time a health professional
had passed AIDS to a patient. She was apparently infected while
having a tooth pulled in 1987.
   Ms. Bergalis was diagnosed in December 1989 with the virus that
causes AIDS. The illness forced her withdrawal from the University
of Florida and documents filed in state court in Palm Beach
described her as being in the disease's advanced stages.
   Ms. Bergalis criticized the CDC, saying she never heard back
from the three officials who investigated her case.
   ``I was watching the news,'' she said. ``I didn't know what to
think. I assumed either that they had dropped my case, or they had
found something and just never did disclose what they had found
with me.''
   CDC officials in Atlanta refused to comment, citing
confidentiality rules.
   Acer acknowledged in a letter _ dated Aug. 31 and made public
Tuesday _ that he was the dentist involved, but said he had
followed CDC safety guidelines, including consulting his doctor
before continuing his practice and wearing gloves and a mask while
treating patients. He said he doubted he was the source of
Bergalis' infection.
   But Ms. Bergalis' lawyer, Robert Montgomery, questioned the late
dentist's ethics.
   ``I would like to know who his peers were that he consulted
prior to continuing to treat patients with HIV positive,''
Montgomery said.
   Montgomery said he planned to sue Acer's estate and CIGNA Dental
Health of Florida on Ms. Bergalis' behalf. He did not say when the
suit would be filed.
   CIGNA referred Bergalis to Acer, who treated about 370 patients
belonging to the dental plan.
   Health officials received more than 100 telephone calls after
the state Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services released
Acer's letter Tuesday. It was unclear how many he sent to former
patients.
   ``I am a gentle man, and I would never intentionally expose
anyone to this disease,'' he wrote.
   The letter did not say how long Acer practiced after being
diagnosed with AIDS.
   The Cleveland native graduated from the Ohio State University
dental school in 1973 and served as an Air Force dentist, leaving
as a captain in 1976, state records show. He was certified to
practice in Florida in August 1976.

<TEXT>
   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat's forces
crushed dissident guerrillas of terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal in
savage fighting Friday that killed at least 25 people and wounded
70, police said.
   They said Arafat's loyalists from the PLO mainstream faction,
Fatah, overran all bases of Abu Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary Council
breakaway faction in a five-hour battle in the Ein el-Hilweh camp
near Sidon, provincial capital of southern Lebanon.
   Among the dead were seven civilians, members of a Palestinian
family killed by a mortar shell that hit their home. The rest were
mostly from Abu Nidal's group, said a police spokesman. He could
not be identified under standing rules.
   The fighting died down at 8 p.m. after Arafat's men wrested
control of all offices and bases of Abu Nidal's group, the
spokesman said.
   That left about 100 fighters of Abu Nidal's group holed up in
the tiny village of Majdalyoun, five miles east of Sidon, their
only remaining base in southern Lebanon, the spokesman said.
   ``We think it's only a matter of days before the PLO moves to
take Majdalyoun,'' he said.
   Arafat and Abu Nidal, whose real name is Aabri al-Banna, have
been at odds since Nidal broke away from Fatah in 1973.
   Abu Nidal tops the wanted lists in the United States and Europe
for a series of terrorist attacks the past 15 years.
   Arafat's men routed about 200 of Abu Nidal's loyalists from the
Rashidiyeh refugee camp near Lebanon's southernmost port of Tyre in
fighting June 17-18.
   Police had said five Abu Nidal guerrillas were killed, 16
wounded and 40 taken prisoner in the two-day crackdown at
Rashidiyeh, home of nearly 20,000 Palestinian refugees 40 miles
south of Beirut.
   Ein el-hilweh, 25 miles south of Beirut, has a population of
31,750 refugees registered with the United Nations.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said
Friday he is willing to go to Iraq to help settle the Persian Gulf
crisis, Tass reported.
   In an interview with Soviet journalists while flying home from
an official visit to Japan, he said he expected Presidents Bush and
Mikhail Gorbachev would discuss at the Helsinki summit Sunday how
to influence events in the gulf by working with other Arab
countries.
   ``We expect that a substantial discussion will be held in the
capital of Finland relating to ways to stimulate the Arab factor in
order to overcome the crisis,'' Shevardnadze was quoted as saying
by the official news agency.
   ``We shall seek to combine the efforts of those with whom we
have good relations and those with whom the United States has good
relations in order to find a way out of the crisis,'' he said.
   Shevardnadze again proposed an international conference on the
gulf that also would take up the Arab-Israeli conflict and Lebanon.
   ``If the need arises, I am ready to travel to Iraq,'' Tass
quoted him as saying.
   Shevardnadze first proposed the conference Tuesday in
Vladivostok.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said he would consider
participating in such a conference but emphasized his refusal to
discuss the Palestinian question at such a forum.
   Shevardnadze on Friday again raised the possibility of such a
meeting, and suggested convening it in three stages, Tass said.
   ``If only we succeeded in convoking such a conference _ with the
participation of the conflicting sides, U.N. Security Council
member-countries and, maybe, some others _ it would become possible
to consider the Persian Gulf situation already at its first stage,
while devoting the second stage to the consideration of the
situation on the occupied Arab territories, i.e., the whole set of
problems relating to the Arab-Israeli conflict,'' Tass quoted him
as saying.
   The third stage of the conference would discuss Lebanon, and
``this conference would undoubtedly stress the role of the Arab
factor,'' he said.
   He said he knew Secretary of State James A. Baker III views his
plan ``without much enthusiasm. But I think one should not be
scared by this idea.''
   Israel has vehemently opposed Soviet ideas to hold an
international conference to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict, and
Shevardnadze acknowledged this.
   ``It will probably be necessary to do some work with Israel at
the ministerial level,'' he added. ``But I want to reiterate, there
is no need to fear such a conference.
   ``What needs to be feared is the consequences of an exacerbated
conflict,'' Shevardnadze said, according to Tass.
   Shevardnadze said settling the crisis via the U.N. Security
Council is a top priority, but he added, ``If a more resolute
action is needed, the U.N. military staff committee should be
used,'' according to Tass.
   Earlier Friday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov
said the Soviet Union would be willing to provide troops for a U.N.
peacekeeping force in the gulf if they were under a joint command
that included Soviet generals.
   Although Iraq is a longtime ally of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev
halted the flow of Soviet arms to Iraq after Moscow condemned
Baghdad's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.

   Amnesty International said Friday it believes that
leading members of the Tuareg community in northeastern Mali may be
prisoners of conscience.
   The London-based human rights group said a number of Tuaregs
have been arrested since armed uprisings by the ethnic group began
in May, following the arrest of members of their tribe.
   Amnesty called on the government of the sub-Saharan country
either to press charges or release the Tuaregs immediately.
   The organization said some Tauregs were being held in poor
conditions, perhaps solely on account of their ethnic origin. It
identified two as Oefane ag Souleymane, a Gao businessman in his
60s, and Sikaye ag Ekawel, director of a government-sponsored food
aid project in Kidal.
   ``Prison conditions in Mali are generally harsh, with inadequate
food and medical care, and a high level of resulting ill health,''
Amnesty said.
   The group had said 29 Tuaregs were executed in August,
apparently without trial. But Mali's Minister-Delegate for Defense,
Gen. Mamadou Coulibaly, said Aug. 21 that no Tuaregs had been
executed, Amnesty said.

<HEAD>Energy Secretary Meets State Representatives</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy Secretary James Watkins met
representatives from oil producing states Friday to discuss ways
that domestic oil production might be increased, department
officials said.
   The meeting was attended by officials from states belonging to
the 29-member Interstate Oil Compact Commission, which is chaired
by Wyoming Gov. Mike Sullivan.
   Bob Porter, a department spokesman, said the meeting was one of
several that Watkins is holding with both oil producers and
consumers in connection with the development of an interim strategy
to ease U.S. reliance on foreign oil and offset any supply
shortfall brought on by the Middle East crisis.
   Watkins previously has met with oil company executives and
planned meetings with other energy industry representatives and
consummer groups in the coming weeks, officials said.
   The Energy Department wants states to temporarily relax oil
production limits. Texas recently agreed to do so with the
expectation that an additional 20,000 barrles per day may be
produced in the state.
   Porter described Friday's meeting an ``an extremely candid
exchange'' but said he could provide no details on what suggestions
the state officials offered.

<HEAD>Iraq Accuses France of Mistreating Iraqis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Iraq on Friday accused the French
government of mistreating Iraqis in France, saying some have been
deported and others illegally interrogated.
   An unidentified Foreign Ministry spokesman told the official
Iraqi News Agency that ``deportations, unlawful interrogation and
turning back Iraqis with valid entry visas are practices taking
place at airports in Paris in particular.''
   ``Even children have been subjected to these measures,'' INA,
monitored in Nicosia, quoted him as saying.
   ``Also, the movement of 14 students at an educational
institution has been restricted and they have been prevented from
traveling,'' he said.
   He said a senior French Foreign Minitry official justified these
actions as ``necessary for France's national security.''
   ``Iraq never threatened France's security and the measures can
only be understood as unjustified acts that serve aggressive
purposes of the U.S. hostile policies toward Iraq,'' the spokesman
said.
   France last week announced that some Iraqis were under police
surveillance and that it had restricted the movement of 29 who had
received military training.
   France, a major arms supplier to Iraq during the 1980-88 war
with Iran, is contributing to naval fleets imposing the blockade on
Iraq to force it to withdraw from Kuwait.
   A large number of French expatriates are among hundreds of
thousands of foreigners who have been trapped in Iraq and Kuwait
since the Aug. 2 invasion.
   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein has sent some to military
installations as part of human shield to avert an attack by
U.S.-led foreign forces assembled in Saudi Arabia.
   The Iraqi spokesman was quoted as saying Iraq was treating the
French expatriates ``normally, except for hosting some of them to
prevent war from breaking out.''
   He added: ``This measure was dictated by the open threats of
military aggressesion made by the United States and its allies.''

<DATELINE>UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The MTV Music Video Awards, not
noted for their cultural significance, produced a curious mixture
of censorship protests and upset victories at their seventh annual
ceremony.
   Irish pop singer Sinead O'Connor breezed past American bombshell
Madonna during Thursday night's three-hour show and took top video,
best female video and the postmodern awards for her stark ``Nothing
Compares 2 U.''
   Madonna, who performed a racy version of her ``Vogue'' video
dressed in an 18th century French costume bursting at the bust, won
for direction, cinematography and editing _ none of which go to her.
   O'Connor created a flap last month when she threatened to walk
out on an audience of 9,000 at the Garden State Arts Center in New
Jersey if the state-owned arena played the national anthem before
her show.
   ``I'd like to say I had a great respect for people of all
countries, including American people,'' she told the sellout crowd
at the Universal Amphitheatre, which gave her a standing ovation.
   ``My attitude over the national anthem was in order to draw
attention to the censorship issue,'' she added. ``When it's racism
disguised as censorship it's even worse.''
   The group 2 Live Crew performed ``Banned in the USA,'' a rap
version of Bruce Springsteen's ``Born in the USA,'' which sparked a
dancefest by audience members waving bumper stickers reading,
``Censorship is UnAmerican.''
   The rappers, whose ``As Nasty as They Want To Be'' album has
been banned by some record stores, called the reaction to their
explicit music racist.
   ``It's a damn shame. It's racist,'' said lead singer Luther
Campbell.
   Ex-Eagle Don Henley beat Billy Idol and M.C. Hammer in the best
male video category for ``End of the Innocence.'' But M.C. Hammer's
``U Can't Touch This'' won in rap and dance categories.
   Janet Jackson won the 1990 Video Vanguard award, MTV's highest
honor. The sister of pop icon Michael Jackson is the first woman to
have the five highest spots on the Billboard charts with cuts from
a single album.
   Aerosmith, which won the metal-hard rock award, also won an
unofficial ``viewer's choice'' honor, in which members of the TV
audience telephoned a 900-number to declare their favorite group.
   Here's a list of the winners of the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards:
   VIDEO OF THE YEAR: ``Nothing Compares 2 U,'' Sinead O'Connor.
   MALE VIDEO: ``The End of the Innocence,'' Don Henley.
   FEMALE VIDEO: ``Nothing Compares 2 U,'' Sinead O'Connor.
   GROUP VIDEO: ``Love Shack,'' B-52's.
   METAL-HARD ROCK VIDEO: ``Janie's Got a Gun,'' Aerosmith.
   NEW ARTIST IN A VIDEO: Michael Penn, ``No Myth''.
   VIDEO FROM A FILM: ``Cradle of Love,'' Billy Idol.
   RAP: ``U Can't Touch This,'' M.C. Hammer.
   DANCE: ``U Can't Touch This,'' M.C. Hammer.
   POST-MODERN: ``Nothing Compares 2 U,'' Sinead O'Connor.
   BREAKTHROUGH VIDEO: ``Sowing the Seeds of Love,'' Tears for
Fears.
   DIRECTION: ``Vogue,'' David Fincher.
   CHOREOGRAPHY: ``Rhythm Nation,'' Anthony Thomas, Janet Jackson.

<HEAD>Officials Say Stasi Knew of Plans for 1983 West Berlin Attack</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   East Germany's now-disbanded secret police
knew of plans for a 1983 bombing in West Berlin that may have been
the work of the world's most notorious terrorist, officials said
Friday.
   The bomb exploded on Aug. 25, 1983, in West Berlin in the French
cultural center known as Maison de France, killing one person and
injuring 23.
   In a letter to West German officials, the terrorist known as
``Carlos'' claimed responsibility.
   The name is the alias for top terrorist Illich Ramirez-Sanchez,
a Venezuelan.
   Carlos is believed to have been behind several attacks,
including the June 27, 1975, killing of two French secret agents
and an attack on a gathering of Arab oil ministers in Vienna six
months later.
   The East German Interior Ministry on Friday said officials with
the now disbanded Stasi secret police had personal contacts with a
international terrorist group calling itself ``Carlos'' up until
last year.
   Stasi officials also knew of preparations for the Maison de
France bombing in West Berlin, the ministry said in a statement.
   According to the statement, Stasi officials had even arranged a
villa for the bombers outside East Berlin.
   The Maison de France housed the French consulate general, the
French Trade Council, a movie theater and a bookstore.
   There have been previous reports of links between East Germany's
secret police and Carlos.
   The West German newspaper Bild reported in July that former East
German security chief Erich Mielke had personal contacts with
Carlos and other top international terrorists.

<HEAD>Biggest Heroin Cash Seizure Claimed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Drug Enforcement Administration claimed its
largest cash seizure from a heroin investigation Friday after the
arrest of four men and the dismantling of an operation that
distributed Asian heroin.
   The DEA displayed the haul, estimated to be worth up to $6
million, at a news conference attended by Mayor David Dinkins, who
has been criticized as failing to deal with crime in the city.
   The total recovered in 28 bags, some too heavy for one person to
carry, was ``in the $4-, $5-, $6-million range,'' said Robert A.
Bryden, the federal agency's New York chief.
   Bryden said it would take four or five days to count all the
money, piled like bricks on conference tables and guarded by two
agents carrying submachine guns.
   About a dozen agents of the East Asian Task Force, drawn from
federal, state and city agencies, raided three sites in Brooklyn
Thursday night. Agents arrested four men, seized the cash and a
submachine gun, two large-caliber pistols and a .25-caliber pistol
with silencer, Bryden said.
   They also found two heroin presses, about three-quarters of a
pound of heroin and 13 cylinders in which they believed as much as
3,000 pounds of heroin could have been smuggled into the country,
Bryden said.
   Rep. Charles Rangel, a Democrat from Harlem in New York, lauded
the multi-agency operation.
   ``It's very easy for us in Washington to declare the war,'' he
said. ``It's the people on the federal, state and local level that
are in the trenches.''
   Dinkins, accompanied by his police commissioner, Lee Brown,
praised the operation and participation of city police.
   ``When that police department does well, I claim the credit,''
the mayor said. ``When that police department does not do well, I
clearly get the blame.''
   Brown said the number of heroin arrests in the city had doubled
over the past 18 months. He called the high number of heroin users
and dealers especially disturbing because it coincides with a
continued high level of crack use.
   Rangel said the heroin came from Burma. Bryden said the agency
did not know where it entered the United States.
   Those arrested, held for arraignment in Brooklyn on charges of
conspiring to distribute heroin, were identified as Ken Lee Sak,
32; Siu Chuen Chung, 32, and Kam-Far Lee, 45, all of Brooklyn, and
Tak Chew Chiu, 30, of Glendale, Ariz.

   Eight men were indicted Friday on murder and
robbery charges in the stabbing of a Utah tourist who died trying
to protect his mother during a holdup.
   Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said he promised
the victim's father, Sherwin Watkins, that the defendants would not
be offered plea bargains.
   ``I expressed my condolences to him, and told him there was
nothing we could do to bring his son back,'' said Morgenthau, who
said seven of the defendants made incriminating videotaped
statements.
   Each was indicted on one count of second-degree murder, two
counts of first-degree robbery, and two counts of second-degree
robbery, said Assistant District Attorney Thomas Shiels.
   State Supreme Court Justice Thomas Straus ordered the suspects
jailed pending a Sept. 24 bail hearing.
   The gang of young men is accused of killing Brian Watkins, 22,
of Provo, Utah, Sunday night after robbing his father of $200 and
some credit cards as the family waited for a subway train.
   Police said the gang wanted the money to pay for a night of
drinking and dancing at a nightclub where several suspects were
arrested.
   Watkins was stabbed in the chest as he tried to defend his
mother, who was punched during the attack. A youth using a box
cutter slashed his father's pants and took the cash.
   The family was in New York for its annual trip to the U.S. Open
tennis tournament. After spending the day at the tournament in the
borough of Queens, the victim, his mother, father, brother and
sister-in-law returned to Manhattan and were heading to Tavern on
the Green in Central Park for dinner.
   The stabbing occurred in the Seventh Avenue subway stop at 53rd
Street.
   Charged were Anthony Anderson, Pascal Carpenter, Emiliano
Fernandez, Ricardo Lopez, Johnny Hincapie, Ricardo Nova and Yull
Gary Morales, all 18, and Luis Fernando Montero, 22. All live in
Queens and all but Montero made a videotaped police statement.
   Police said Morales stabbed Watkins with a butterfly knife. Two
other suspects were being sought, Morgenthau said.
   Watkins' funeral is scheduled for Saturday in Provo.

   Maoist Shining Path guerrillas killed four
people, including a teen-age student, in attacks outside the
central Andean city of Huancayo, police said Friday.
   In the first incident, rebels shortly after midnight shot to
death two brothers in Orcotuna, 9 miles north of Huancayo, police
said. Huancayo is 120 miles east of Lima.
   Police said eight masked insurgents with machine guns dragged
the brothers from a party out into the street. There the guerrillas
tortured the brothers before shooting them repeatedly.
   The guerrillas left their trademark sign on the bodies, ``This
is how police informers die,'' according to police.
   Guerrillas also killed a schoolteacher and a student in Chupaca,
5 miles west of Huancayo, police said.
   Police said four masked guerrillas, one of them a woman, raided
the town school looking for the pre-military academy instructor.
The insurgents shot the instructor 10 times and also fired at
students who tried to protect him. One 18-year-old student was
killed and another was seriously injured, police said.
   The guerrillas left a sign on the instructor's body threatening
a similar fate for others connected to the military.
   Meanwhile, police were searching Friday for 30 heavily armed
pro-Castro Tupac Amaru guerrillas spotted near Satipo, 70 miles
northeast of Huancayo. Police said the rebels held meetings this
week with local farmers to hear their grievances.
   Huancayo, a major commercial city, and other towns in the
fertile Mantaro Valley, have been the targets of a growing
guerrilla offensive in recent weeks. The guerrillas plan to cut off
Lima's main food supply.
   Clashes between guerrillas and the armed forces have claimed
over 19,500 lives since the Shining Path took up arms in 1980. The
majority of victims have been civilans.
   The guerrillas aim to overthrow the government and set up a
worker-peasant state. After 10 years of insurgency, over half the
country's 22 million inhabitants live in government-declared
emergency zones under military control.

   About 225,000 Egyptians waited Friday
at the Iraqi border to cross into Jordan, but they were held back
because Jordan cannot cope with the 100,000 refugees already
stranded in its desert, a border official said.
   A U.N. relief official warned the refugee problem could explode
into a ``human tragedy.''
   Four tons of canned beef from the Netherlands were sent to
laboratories for testing Friday after tons of cookies, powdered
milk and dates sent to hungry refugees were deemed unfit for human
consumption.
   The worthless food was the latest in a series problems
confronting the people trying to ease the misery of 45,000 Asian
refugees packed into the makeshift Shaalan I camp here.
   Fights have broken out in this and other camps jam-packed with
hungry refugees who fled Iraq and Kuwait after Iraq invaded Aug 2.
They scramble and jostle for a meager daily ration of a piece of
bread, a tomato and a cucumber.
   Red Cross officials and others say some refugees have gone for
up to three days with little water, food or shelter.
   The Jordanian border official, who requested anonymity, said the
Egyptians were stranded in a huge camp just inside the Iraqi border.
   ``They are waiting under terrible conditions for permission to
cross into Jordan to continue their journey home,'' the official
said, who cannot be named under regulations.
   ``But we cannot cope with such huge numbers before the Asian
evacuees already inside Jordan waiting for transportation to their
homes are shifted,'' he added.
   He said 18,325 crossed through this post during the day.
   James N. Purcell, director of the U.N. International
Organization for Migration, appealed urgently for ships and
aircraft to repatriate the Asians squatting in hot and dirty camps
``before human suffering becomes a human tragedy.''
   Jordanian officials are doing their best to stretch meager
resources while awaiting international help to care for the nearly
100,000 refugees already in the country.
   On Wednesday, Jordan ordered 10 tons of dates returned to Egypt
after they were tested and found to be too old and hard to eat.
Forty more tons were on the way to Jordan, and authorities said
they, too, probably would be sent back.
   Rahib Moussa, an official with Jordan's Ministry of Supply, said
Friday it would take at least a day for a laboratory to inspect the
canned beef, only the second shipment of outside aid received at
Shaalan I near the Iraqi border.
   India earlier donated 10,000 sandwiches and 5,000 barrels of
water, he said.
   Most of the refugees crammed into tents at the Shaalan I camp
are Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Indian and Sri Lankan men. Many of the
women and children are being sent to refugee camps in Amman, Moussa
said.
   On Friday, at least 2,000 people stood in a seemingly endless
line that snaked through the hot sand. Those patient enough waited
for hours under the scorching sun for a piece of bread, slice of
cheese and tomato provided by the government.
   Moussa said the government plans to speed up the distribution at
the camp by creating seven feeding stations instead of just one. On
Friday, a nun from Mother Teresa's order stood by offering words of
encouragement and sympathy.
   At a tent hospital set up by the Red Cross-Red Crescent, Dr.
Khaled Issa said 2,000 people a day come in for treatment. Most are
suffering dehydration, colds and other minor illnesses. But in the
harsh camp conditions, minor ailments can rapidly become
life-threatening.
   Issa said those who are sick should drink 5 gallons of water a
day, much more than is available.
   A five-member delegation from the European Parliament toured
Jordan's camps and said Friday they were appalled by the
conditions. One member of the delegation called on European nations
to provide military transport planes to airlift the refugees home.
   France's minister for humanitarian aid, Bernard Kouchner,
speaking to reporters in Amman, said 10,000 more people arrive
every day in Jordan from Kuwait and Iraq. Jordanian officials
estimate the number of new arrivals at about 18,000. Nobody really
knows.
   Official estimates say more than 250,000 foreigners, mostly
Asians, have crossed the desert border post at Reweishid since Aug.
2 following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   Regardless of the precise number, one thing is clear. For those
stranded in Kuwait, Kouchner said: ``these are very, very hard
days.''

   Michael J. Davies, the editor, publisher and
chief executive officer of The Hartford Courant, was named Thursday
to replace Reg Murphy as publisher and chief executive officer of
The Sun newspapers.
   Murphy, 56, will become chairman of The Sun newspapers, said
David Laventhol, president of Times Mirror Co., which owns the
morning and evening papers in Baltimore and the morning daily in
Hartfort, Conn.
   ``Reg Murphy has been an outstanding leader of the Baltimore Sun
for the past decade, both before and after Times Mirror's
acquisition of the paper in 1986 from the A.S. Abell Co.,''
Laventhol said.
   ``He has been a journalistic innovator, leading the paper to two
Pulitzer prizes, to record-breaking circulation gains and to
substantially improved business operations during his tenure.''
   Raymond A. Jansen will succeed Davies as publisher and chief
executive officer of the Courant, newspaper spokesman Dennis Schain
said. The newspaper's senior vice president and general manager
since 1986, the 51-year-old Jansen held numerous advertising and
sales positions during a 22-year career at Newsday in on New York's
Long Island before going to the Courant in 1982.
   Michael E. Waller, the Courant's executive editor since 1986,
was named the newspaper's editor and vice president. Waller went to
Hartford from Kansas City, Mo., where he served as editor of The
Kansas City Star and Times.
   In seven years as publisher of the Courant, Davies ``was an
industry leader, launching a major new zoning effort last year and
improving customer service at every level of the newspaper,''
Laventhol said. Zoning is the practice giving different geographic
areas their own newspaper sections.
   Murphy joined the Sun papers in 1981 after serving as editor and
publisher of the San Francisco Examiner since 1975. From 1961 to
1975, he was with the Atlanta Constitution. He started there as a
political reporter and was named editor of the newspaper in 1968.
   He began his newspaper career with the Macon (Ga.) Telegraph and
News in 1956. He attended Mercer University and Harvard University.
   Davies, 46, came to the Courant in 1983 from The Kansas City
Star and Times, where he had been president and editor since 1978.
Before that, he spent two years as managing editor of The
Courier-Journal in Louisville, Ky., and was managing editor of the
Louisville Times from 1971 to 1976.
   He began his journalism career in 1961 as a reporter for the
Savannah (Ga.) Morning News.
   He has a bachelor's degree from Georgia State University and a
master's in journalism from Northwestern University.
   Murphy will continue to represent Times Mirror as the chairman
of the board of directors of Newspapers First, a national
advertising sales organization. He also will be involved in the
management of the Sun's weeklies and its audiotex service.
   Times Mirror, a Los Angeles-based company, publishes the Los
Angeles Times, Newsday, New York Newsday, The Sun newspapers, the
Courant, The Morning Call in Allentown, Pa., The (Stamford)
Advocate and Greenwich (Conn.) Time.
   The company also has interests in broadcast and cable television
and book, magazine and other publishing.

<TEXT>
   Christian Brando's defense lawyer
has asked a court to reduce the murder charge against him to
manslaughter.
   Another motion, filed Wednesday in Superior Court, seeks to
suppress a tape-recorded police interview of Brando, the son of
actor Marlon Brando.
   Attorney Robert Shapiro will argue the motions before Superior
Court Judge Robert Thomas on Sept. 14, said Sandi Gibbons,
spokeswoman for the district attorney's office.
   Brando, 32, pleaded innocent to first-degree murder in the May
16 shooting of Dag Drollet, 26, the boyfriend of Christian's
half-sister, Cheyenne. He was found dead in Marlon Brando's hilltop
Bel Air estate.
   Trial is set for Oct. 1.
   Shapiro argued unsuccessfully during a preliminary hearing that
the murder charge should be reduced to manslaughter because there
was no evidence Brando intended to kill Drollet.
   The attorney cited statements Christian Brando made to police
that the shooting occurred accidentally while he and Drollet
struggled for a gun.
   Prosecutors have cited reports that Drollet was clutching a TV
remote control device and other items when his body was discovered.
   Shapiro filed the motion seeking to suppress the recorded
interview even though a judge has ruled the statements cannot be
used because a police detective failed to advise Brando of his
right to a court-appointed attorney.
   Brando was released from jail last month after his father met $2
million bail by posting the deed to his estate.

   The State Department said Friday night the
United States would ``view with utmost seriousness'' any
Iraqi-sponsored terrorism.
   Terrorist attacks would be more likely if fighting breaks out in
the Persian Gulf, the department said.
   The department offered no explanation why it issued such a
statement at the unusual hour of 8:30 p.m. In the language of
diplomacy, ``view with utmost seriousness'' is considered a grave
warning of severe consequences.
   Spokesman Mark Dillen, when asked, would say only that the
statement ``simply updates and further draws attention to the
phenomena described in the statement.''
   He said the department did not know of any ``specific,
credible'' terrorist threat. Asked if it knew of any general,
credible threat, he replied, ``No.''
   The statement said Iraq had expanded support for several
terrorist groups, particularly radical Palestinian elements, in
recent months.
   Groups supported by Iraq could attack at ``almost any time''
throughout Europe and the Middle East, with Americans and American
interests among the targets, the statement said.
   ``Iraq support for terrorist groups also endangers U.S.
interests in other regions, although to a lesser extent,'' the
department said.
   ``Such attacks would become more likely if hostilities were to
occur in the Persian Gulf region. The United States would view with
utmost seriousness any Iraqi-sponsored terrorist attack.''
   The department said it would ``provide additional information to
overseas travelers or other concerned parties'' if it received
``specific, credible'' information on a threat to overseas American
interests.
   The department restored Iraq to its list of governments
sponsoring terrorism on Sept. 1. It had been removed several years
ago when the United States was cooperating with Iraq in opposing
Iran.

   An armed high school sophomore held nine
classmates hostage for more than five hours Thursday, releasing
some for candy and soda before growing dizzy and surrendering,
officials said.
   No one was injured during the hostage ordeal at the combined
South Forsyth high school and middle school in Forsyth County,
about 40 miles north of Atlanta.
   Most of the school's 1,200 students were evacuated, and hundreds
of worried parents flocked to the campus as word of the incident
spread. The episode began about 8:30 a.m., shortly after classes
began.
   Forsyth County Sheriff Wesley Walraven said the youth,
identified as 10th-grader Randy Addis, carried a small duffel bag
holding three weapons into the school, pulled out a rifle in Don
Hutchins' civics class and fired it over the students' heads.
   Johnny Tallant, who was teaching in the next room, struggled
with Addis and got the rifle away from him, but not before another
shot was fired, the sheriff said. Addis then ran, Hutchins tackled
him and the youth pulled a shotgun from his bag, he said.
   The youth, armed with the shotgun and a pistol, ordered
Hutchins' students into Tallant's classroom and held both classes _
about 40 students _ at gunpoint, Walraven said.
   Most of the students were released gradually during the morning,
including all the girls but one, who chose to stay because she knew
Addis, he said.
   Some hostages were freed in exchange for candy and soda, said
Joyce Shadburn, a spokeswoman for the county's school
superintendent. The only other demand was for a school bus, she
said, adding that a bus had been taken to the scene.
   Student Shelly Dixon said the boy told ``us to stand up and put
our hands on our heads. He started cussing at us. He said if we
said anything, he'd shoot us.''
   Walraven said the youth demanded the bus to take him to Savannah
and $3,000 cash.
   About 1:45 p.m., Addis began to get dizzy and two of the
hostages ran out, the sheriff said. Officers moved in to take his
weapons and he did not resist.
   ``From our information, he was wearing down. He was starting to
get dizzy. His reaction time was slow,'' said Walraven.
   Addis was being held without bond at the Forsyth County Jail and
was charged with kidnapping and weapons violations, officials said.
   Seventh-grader Shawn Abercrombie, whose older brother was among
the final hostages, described Addis as ``a quiet guy. He has
problems and has seizures and takes pills for them.''
   The youth had a seizure last week, Abercrombie said, and another
student made fun of him. But police would not speculate on the
reasons for the hostage-taking.

   A United Nations conference on crime-fighting
ended in Cuba on Friday with a human rights watchdog group saying
its representatives were harassed and threatened by President Fidel
Castro's communist regime.
   The International League for Human Rights said three of its
U.N.-approved delegation of five were prevented from taking part in
the weeklong Seventh Congress on Crime in Havana, Cuba's capital.
   All three are prominent anti-Castro human rights activists and
Havana residents.
   Yndamiro Restano is a member of the Cuban Commission for Human
Rights and National Reconciliation.
   Antonio de Varona Batlle served as defense counsel for
commission leader Elizardo Sanchez when Sanchez was recently tried
for ``disseminating false news against international peace.''
   Jorge Bacallao is a legal adviser to the Cuban Human Rights
Committee, another non-government group.
   The league said in a news release from its base in New York City
that the three Cubans were ``threatened and followed by security
officials, and may suffer reprisals after the conference
concludes.''
   It quoted league board member Robert Cox, another of its
delegates in Havana, as saying the five ``were harassed,
intimidated and threatened throughout the meeting'' and that
``state security groups appear to be out of control.''
   ``Security guards challenged the delegates on the grounds that
the three, two of whom are lawyers and all of whom are experts on
criminal justice in Cuba, were connected to human rights
organizations in Cuba that are not officially recognized by the
government,'' the league said.
   It said one of the Cubans ``was physically pushed out of the
conference hall'' and all three ``were physically detained
temporarily by security police in a hall off the conference site.''
   The league quoted Cox as saying that security official Felipe
Zilla ``intimated to him that Mrs. Restano was in danger.''
   Cuban acting Foreign Minister Rolando Lopes del Amo threatened
both Cox and the league, saying ``his government would oppose the
league's continued consultative status at the United Nations,'' the
league said.
   Cox, a Briton, was awarded the United Kingdom's Order of the
British Empire for denouncing rights abuses by right-wing military
regimes during Argentina's ``dirty war'' against suspected leftist
subversives in the 1970s.
   Cox was editor of the Buenos Aires Herald at the time. He is now
associate editor of the Charleston, S.C., Courier and Post.
   Dianne Orentlicher, the fifth delegate and another league board
member, is a lawyer who taught at Yale, Harvard and Columbia
universities.
   The league, founded in 1942, has been accredited to the U.N. for
more than a half-century and works to combat rights abuses
worldwide. Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov was its honorary
president until he died last year.
   The congress is held by the U.N. every five years to formulate
guidelines on crime-fighting, protecting prisoners from abuse and
protecting their lawyers from reprisals in countries under
authoritarian governments.
   Dispatches on the conference by the official Cuban news agency
Prensa Latina from Havana, monitored here, made no mention of the
incidents between the Castro government and the league's
representatives.
   A Prensa Latina dispatch Friday said the conference closed after
holding 14 plenary sessions and approving about 30 resolutions, one
of them praising the Castro government and the Cuban people for
their hospitality.
   It said 1,700 delegates from 129 nations attended the meeting.

   That cough of Camille's has been a siren song
for some of the world's best-known actresses and singers. From
Sarah Bernhardt to Eleanora Duse to Greta Garbo to Maria Callas,
the consumptive courtesan who dies for love has been a staple on
stage, on screen and in the opera house.
   But move over, ladies. Everett Quinton has made the role his own
in Charles Ludlam's giddy, giggly adaptation of ``Camille'' that
resurfaced Thursday at off-Broadway's Ridiculous Theatrical Company.
   Ludlum, who died in 1987, originally starred as Camille 17 years
ago in the troupe's tiny Sheridan Square theater. By all accounts,
his performance was definitive, but Quinton, Ludlum's successor as
head of the Ridiculous Theater, is a worthy and very funny
replacement.
   In fact, with this role, Quinton moves out from Ludlum's shadow
and into the spotlight as a first-rate clown, an expressive lead
performer who knows when to go for pathos or a pratfall.
   The actor has a quizzical comic face, highlighted by a Grand
Canyon-size mouth. As Camille, he can be haughty, even slighty
malevolent, but you know it's all in fun. Here, dressed in
Elizabeth Fried's outlandish costumes and sporting a dark wig of
what appears to be tightly coiled mattress springs, he resembles
Agnes Moorehead crossed with Martha Raye.
   Ludlum's version of the Alexandre Dumas tearjerker veers all
over the map _ from high camp to poignant melodrama. But the
adapter never lost sight of the basic story of a woman sacrificing
herself for the man she loved. And Quinton, who also doubles as
director, doesn't either.
   He keeps a firm hand on the production, not letting the play get
too moist or too wild. A menagerie of distinctive character actors
offer some memorable portraits, particularly Stephen Pell as
Nanine, the ever-loyal maid; H.M. Koutoukas as a lascivious baron;
and Georg Osterman as Camille's true love.
   ``Camille'' ranks as one of Ludlam's best efforts, and Quinton
has managed to preserve the laughter and a bit of the tears. And
much of the fun comes from his own splendid performance.

   There is a certain grim fascination in watching ``Money Talks,''
a fascination not unlike driving by an auto accident on the
interstate and wondering how _ and why _ it happened.
   This dumb comedy by Edwin Schloss, which arrived Thursday at
off-Broadway's Promenade Theater, is something the New York theater
hasn't seen in a while _ a vanity production that seems to have
been produced more for the benefit of the playwright than for the
audience. It never should have opened.
   ``Money Talks,'' which reportedly cost $500,000, has an
elaborate, yet ugly, set and a cast of 11 actors. Most prominent
among them are Dolores Gray and Helen Gallagher, two formidable
musical comedy stars.
   The plot revolves around several wealthy Manhattan matrons who
invest in the stock market. The jokes died before vaudeville:
   ``Nature abhors a vacuum.''
   ``So does my cleaning lady.''
   The direction is nonexistent and the acting, except for the
unsinkable Miss Gallagher, hard to watch.
   The evening strings together a series of low points that reach
Death Valley level in the second act when the matrons, dressed in
black for a funeral, parade across the stage to Ravel's ``Bolero.''
Where is Bo Derek when you really need her?
   Miss Gray gets to sing a bit of an old Irving Berlin song,
``Marrying for Love,'' at the end of the show. The diversion
doesn't help, but does remind audiences that the woman should be
back in the musical theater instead of appearing in such disasters
as ``Money Talks.''

   A militant black activist said
Thursday he's calling off a protest of the Miss America Pageant
after reaching an agreement with its director.
   The Rev. Al Sharpton and the city's black youths will not
disrupt Friday's parade or the Saturday night finals with their
demand for a recreational center in Atlantic City, he and pageant
Director Leonard Horn said at a Boardwalk news conference.
   But the protesters will stage a peaceful Boardwalk march
Saturday, Sharpton said.
   Sharpton and 22 others were arrested Monday after about 200
protesters blocked the inbound lanes of the casino city's main
thoroughfare, the Atlantic City Expressway.
   Sharpton promised after his arrest to disrupt the pageant. The
group had 100 tickets for the televised extravaganza Saturday, he
said.
   But Sharpton said Thursday the group's quarrel was not with the
pageant.
   ``As we confront the issue, let's not confuse the issue,''
Sharpton said. ``We feel it would be unfair to do anything contrary
against other youth who are trying to develop themselves.''
   Horn said Sharpton contacted him Wednesday. The men agreed
Thursday afternoon that a demonstration was useless, Horn said.
   Youth leader Jason Sales, 16, said the protesters wanted only to
dramatize the city's lack of a recreational center. The group
refers to itself as the Forgotten Youth of Atlantic City.
   After the news conference, Horn and Sharpton closed the deal
with a handshake. Horn then presented Sharpton with a handful of
cigars, saying he had heard the New York City activist was an avid
cigar smoker.
   Meanwhile, Miss Illinois Marjorie Judith Vincent won the last of
three talent competitions and Miss Mississippi Beth Howell the last
of three swimsuit competitions in the Thursday night preliminaries
of the Miss America Pageant.
   The 50 Miss America hopefuls are divided into three groups, who
compete in talent, swimsuit and evening gown divisions on three
successive nights to qualify for Saturday's finals. Thursday was
the last of the three preliminary competitions.
   The winner of the evening gown competition is kept secret to
heighten the suspense for Saturday night's finals.
   Miss Texas Suzanne Lawrence won the first talent competition and
Miss Colorado Karrie Mitchell won the first swimsuit competition in
the Tuesday night preliminary.
   Miss North Carolina Scarlet Morgan won the second talent
competition and Miss Florida Dana Rinehart Dalton won the second
swimsuit competition in the Wednesday night preliminary.

   Madonna's ``Vogue'' video won for direction, cinematography and

   A judge's ruling has made it more difficult
for an art gallery and its director to fight obscenity charges for
displaying Robert Mapplethorpe's sexually graphic photographs, a
defense lawyer says.
   Hamilton County Municipal Judge David J. Albanese on Thursday
ordered the Contemporary Arts Center and director Dennis Barrie to
stand trial Sept. 24 on one misdemeanor count each of pandering
obscenity.
   Defense lawyers contend the 175-picture Mapplethorpe exhibition
_ mostly portraits and pictures of flowers _ isn't obscene when
viewed as a whole. But Albanese granted a prosecution request to
let a jury see only the five pictures that depict sex acts.
   ``I'm disappointed but I'm not surprised,'' Barrie's lawyer, H.
Louis Sirkin, said after the hearing. ``It certainly doesn't help
us.''

   The financial performance of banks in the
Midwest, South and West showed improvement in the second quarter,
while loan problems continued to grow in the Northeast and
Southeast, government figures show.
   Nationwide, commercial banks earned $5.3 billion from April
through June of this year, down 24 percent from the same period in
1989, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. reported Thursday.
   The FDIC said banks in the Northeast dragged down profits for
the entire industry, which had earned a record $7 billion in the
second quarter of 1989.
   ``It's not great, but it's not terrible,'' said Robert Litan, a
senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington research

   The leader of the nation's largest black
church says racism in America is worse now than it was during the
civil rights struggles of the 1950s and '60s.
   Former President Reagan and his appointments to the Supreme
Court are a large part of the problem, the Rev. T.J. Jemison said
Thursday at the 110th annual meeting of the National Baptist
Convention U.S.A. Inc.
   ``He (Reagan) will be remembered not because he didn't have a
memory, but he will be remembered because he gave respectability to
racism,'' he said.
   Jemison, who led one of the first successful boycotts of
segregated busing in Baton Rouge, La., in 1953, said race relations
stand at a criticial point in the nation's history.
   He said he thought the battle to condemn racism had been won
during the civil rights struggle, but ``it's worse now than it's
ever been.''

   Gun control supporters are calling for a
nationwide ban on bringing firearms within 1,000 feet of schools,
but federal officials say it would be virtually impossible to
enforce.
   ``Passage of this bill will enable our children and their
teachers to travel to and from ... schools without an overriding
fear for their personal safety,'' Cleveland police Chief Edward P.
Kovacic said Thursday.
   He urged the House Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on crime
to approve the bill, which is similar to provisions included in an
omnibus crime package already approved by the Senate.
   Bringing a gun within 1,000 yards of a schoolyard would be
punishable by a maximum five-year sentence under the measure.
   The bill reflects growing concern over gun incidents on school
grounds in recent years, including multiple slayings of youngsters
by deranged individuals in Stockton, Calif., and Winnetka, Ill.

   It is peaceful in the seminary, as it was
through times of partition, before the communists and after they
fell, and when rigid economics was left behind on the bumpy road to
a free market.
   The only sounds reaching the office are the gentle swish of long
black robes as priests glide across the marble floor in sandals,
and the chirping of swallows that inhabit lush inner courtyards
thick with ferns, red petunias and lavender geraniums.
   Priestly routine in Poland, one of only five countries where the
number of Roman Catholic seminary students has risen steadily the
last decade, bears little resemblance to the difficult, uncertain
life on the outside.
   While the church generally faces a chronic shortage of priests,
the number in this country rose from 20,234 in 1980 to 24,678 in
1989, according to the Polish Episcopate Office.
   That works out to one priest for 1,280 church members, compared
with 1,650 members per priest in the United States.
   Burundi, Rwanda, Zaire and India are the only other countries
with net increases in recent years.
   Church officials give many reasons young men are attracted to
the priesthood in Poland, where more than 90 percent of the people
are Catholics. Most obvious is a desire to follow the path of the
Polish pope, John Paul II, whose image is displayed over shop
doors, in cars, even on key chains.
   ``John Paul is beloved everywhere, but especially here,'' said
the Rev. Szymon Stefanowicz of the Jasna Gora monastery in
Czestochowa, site of Poland's holiest shrine. ``Is it any wonder
young men want to be like him? He is such a good force in this
world.''
   Being a priest is a mark of prestige in Poland. Enrollment of a
son in the seminary is as much a cause for celebration as an
American child's acceptance into law or medical school.
   Although church officials stress the compulsion to answer God's
call, some acknowledge the attraction also may be practical.
   Since World War II, families have had to wait decades for
apartments, telephones and cars. Until the economic reforms of
January, they had to spend hours in line for such essentials as
milk and eggs.
   In contrast, seminaries offered secure housing, intellectual
opportunities and a chance to travel outside the Soviet bloc.
   Several priests, who spoke on condtion of anonymity, said
semimaries were havens of safety and comparative comfort through
the bad times.
   Outside, the dangers of communist rule now have been replaced by
painful aspects of the ``shock therapy'' economic plan.
   Inflation is more than 170 percent so far this year and
unemployment, unknown under the communists, has reached 4 percent.
   ``In the West, children are born with everything: television,
computers and cars,'' said Brother Marian Laskowski, a 24-year-old
monk from Elblag in northern Poland. ``In Poland, we are born with
very little.''
   Laskowski said he chose the seminary because he is drawn to God,
but admitted to occasional doubts.
   ``I see people come here wearing short sleeves and short pants,
and I am spending the best years of my life between these cold
marble walls,'' he said. The monk, dressed in a heavy robe, was
tending a stand at St. John's Cathedral in Warsaw that sells icons
and religious postcards.
   Brother Maciek Gaup, also 24, said his decision was made at an
early age. ``Poland is a very spiritual country,'' he said. ``Our
religion is very, very strong and old.''
   Even when the communists were in power, Poland moved to the
rhythms of the Roman Catholic Church.
   In the Soviet Union, those who worshiped openly faced
persecution and the Orthodox Church was strictly controlled. In
Poland, the church withstood the repression and becoming a powerful
rival of the regime.
   During martial law in 1981-83, the pulpit was a bastion of
dissent. The Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, the ``Solidarity priest''
murdered by secret policemen in 1984, is revered as a martyr.
   Worshipers fill churches each Sunday. Construction of religious
buildings in many predominantly Catholic countries has all but
stopped, but nearly 1,000 churches and other religious buildings
have been erected in Poland since 1985.
   The Rev. Henryk Kietlinski, deputy superior of the Pallotines,
one of the country's most popular religious orders, interviews
hundreds of young men who apply for adminission to its seminary
each year.
   ``Many of them are very excited about passing on the pastoral
word in today's world,'' he said. ``Others want to give service to
the world, and others are excited about the possibility of
missionary work in other countries.
   ``Those who become missionaries are able to live abroad and
learn other languages, promote culture in places like Brazil,
Central Africa and Asia.''
   Poland is one of the few countries with enough priests to send
some of them abroad.
   Travel by priests was almost unrestricted under the communists,
but they made it extremely difficult for most other Poles to
venture outside the Soviet bloc.
   Now that Poland is democratic, a goal the church helped achieve,
some Catholic officials fear growing Western influence will deter
young men from the priesthood.
   Records and videos of Madonna, whose Catholic allusions the
church calls blasphemous, are best sellers. Sex shops and
pornography, once taboo, are cropping up in all but the smallest
villages.
   ``More and more of today's youth is intellectually weak,''
Kietlinski said. ``This comes from thoughtless television shows,
bad videos, poorly organized free time and bad family attitudes.''
   The church, he said, intends to reverse the trend with a series
of ``positive'' television programs developed by young priests. In
August, the government announced the return of voluntary religious
classes to primary and secondary schools, a move largely prompted
by church officials.

<TEXT>
   Andrew Lanyi and his researchers study as many
as 30,000 earnings reports a year seeking what they hope will
become blue-chip investments, but you won't find a single blue chip
in their portfolio.
   The reason: Lanyi tries to detect the faint hue of blue before
it deepens, to search out small, growing companies that seem
destined to become high-quality stocks, to discover tomorrow's blue
chips today.
   Somewhere out there are the new McDonald's or H&amp;R Blocks or
Automatic Data Processings _ companies that developed repeat
businesses, that perfected repetitous production of products.
Cookie-cutters products, he calls them.
   By the time Lanyi's choices are true blue and highly visible
they might have been removed from his portfolio, sold for a very
good price to the more traditional investors such as mutual funds.
   Replacing them will be other emerging companies, young outfits
with good products, repeat business, good management and good
profits. Some of these too will become A-one investments.
Inevitably, others will fade.
   It's a lot of work for Lanyi, seven days a week, reading,
talking with management, querying suppliers, and all to discover
perhaps eight prospects a year. Hard work is part of the job, he
says, explaining that as an immigrant Hungarian philosopher he was
lucky even to get into the business.
   Sequent Computers, the biggest holding in the portfolio, was
purchased in January 1988 at about $7.25, rose to as much as $34
and sold this week at about $24.
   Care Plus, bought at year ago at about $8.25, sold this week at
about $18. Occupational Urgent-Care Health Systems, bought in March
1989 at $6.12{, sold this week at more than $20 after having
reached a high of $27.25.
   Wide price swings are in the nature of such stocks, and it takes
patience, information and nerves to stay with them. Lanyi has
stayed with all these stocks, even though some are off sharply in
recent weeks.
   After a one-day decline of $3, Pharmacy Management Services sold
this week at about $8. Lanyi checked it out, found that growth
rather than sales problems had cut profits, and decided to stick
with it. He's an investor, he said, not a trader. The decline made
him more aggressive, he said.
   That sort of confidence is based on knowledge of the company, he
said, and Lanyi sometimes knows more about a company than some of
its officers. Most of this research is done before he buys, but
some is done afterward, too.
   To even consider a stock it must have a dominant position in its
market; be undiscovered by Wall Street; be recession resistant;
occupy a niche, such as home infusion therapy; and have earnings
growth of 30 percent a year.
   Perhaps 300 of them meet the critieria. Lanyi and his
researchers then telephone the company president, who might be
invited to New York to discuss prospects over the next five or six
months. About 100 get the invitation.
   At least five of the company's suppliers and 10 of its clients
are then interviewed. Lanyi himself might even talk to the
company's printer, asking how many boxes or brochures were being
prepared, compared with an earlier period.
   If the printer says he is required to print more and more boxes
Lanyi is pleased. He isn't pleased if the printer states, even
enthusiastically, ``Yes, the company's giving us the same big order
as they gave us last month.''
   Hearing a response like that, Lanyi grows wary, and his research
team is put to work even harder. Conceivably, it could be a sign
that growth is topping out, a very early warning signal to sell.
Why wait for the earnings report?
   Lanyi always tries to sell into strength, to sell before a stock
levels off to just normal growth. Selling is the art, he says, even
more so than buying. ``Take 1,000 brokers, 999 of them are poor
sellers,'' he says.
   Operating as a division of Landenburg, Thalmann &amp; Co., Lanyi and
his staff handle more than 400 accounts, most of which began with
an initial investment of $50,000. Lanyi makes the recommendations,
the customers make the decisions.

<HEAD>New ``Dracula'' Series To Make Transylvania Necker Family Fare</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Geordie in 5th graf is cq</NOTE>

   For reasons known only to students of a full
moon, vampire movies have Hollywood flapping these days _ at least
five are planned. But TV also has a new Dracula in the wings.
   The syndicated ``DRACULA _ The Series,'' however, arriving Sept.
24 on 113 U.S. stations, is a little different from most versions
of the Transylvania Necker.
   Its half-hour tales are being shot in the tiny duchy of
Luxembourg _ yes, Luxembourg.
   And this Dracula is not quite like the pioneering Bela Lugosi
movie model of 1931 that still keeps impressionists telling their
children, ``Drrrrinnk your soooop beforrre it congealllssss.''
   This Dracula, played by Geordie Johnson, is a ruthless European
mogul who seeks global domination through his conglomerate empire.
He's sort of like Gordon Gekko of ``Wall Street'' with a taste for
type A positive.
   Perhaps he's the modern sort of vampire-businessman, hunting for
a corporate takeover or a bare neck nearly 24 hours a day?
   ``Well, in our bible of vampirology, we've decided that he's
found ways through modern technology _ sun block or whatever _ to
operate during the day,'' said David Patterson, the show's
executive producer.
   ``So he doesn't have to go off and hide in the crypt during the
day. On the other hand, he has no vampire-like powers until the sun
sets.''
   Although Patterson's Dracula does wear a black cape now and then
and develops the customary upper fangs when it's time to go for the
gusto, traditionalists who see this mod version may say ``Oh,
drat.''
   They may say worse when they learn the other regulars in this
``Dracula'' include two American teen-agers who get caught up in
things while visiting Europe with their mother.
   The lads team up with another regular, their Uncle Gustav, to
battle the show's Dracula, who goes by the name Alexander Lucard.
   It helps that Uncle Gustav (Benard Behrens) proves to be from a
long line of Dracula-chasers and has some inherited wisdom in this
matter. Dracula, by Patterson's estimate, has been undead since the
1400s.
   The show specifies no European country as its setting. That it's
filmed in Luxembourg _ the sort of duchy where occasionally you may
hear Flemish spoken _ is due as much to lower costs as to
Transylvania-like scenery that includes medieval castles, dungeons
and caverns.
   ``The Luxembourg government has been going to great lengths to
attract film and television production recently,'' said Patterson,
whose production company is based in Toronto.
   The U.S. networks have no vampire efforts this season. Indeed,
the last memorable network series about vampires, zombies and
weirdos who howl in the night was in the halcyon season of 1974-75,
when ABC aired the magnificent ``Kolchak: The Night Stalker.''
   That series starred Darren McGavin as a wisecracking wire
service reporter whose bureau chief kept spiking his amazing
stories of life in the undead lane.
   ``That was an extremely well-done show, and one that we
certainly were aware of during the course of developing this one,''
Patterson said. ``That's because we didn't want to be emulating
anything that had been done.''
   His ``Dracula,'' which has an order for 21 episodes, will be
different in yet another way.
   It's intended for family viewing. That means no lingering shots
of punctured aortas or a bloody-mouthed prince of darkness saying
``Fangs for the the memory,'' or whatever it is such princes say
these days.
   There will be Dracula-caused departures, Patterson said. But
``we are sensitive to the fact that we can't allow the show to boil
down to only blood-sucking and our heroes holding up a cross at the
end of each episode.''
   When the show's modern Dracula sips from his talking cup of
life, he said, that will be alluded to ``but not graphically
portrayed.''
   ``We're talking family drama here. We hope we've got a show that
parents will be happy to see, along with their 9- and 10-year-olds.
. . . We want it to be a family drama, and we think it is.''

   PUT ON A HAPPY FACE...OR THIGH: Shy, retiring talk show host
Joan Rivers is starting the second season of ``The Joan Rivers
Show'' today with the perfect contest for those who suspect they're
not perfect.
   It is the ``Rivers Re-Do,'' a chance for viewers unhappy with
their faces or bodies to win a free plastic surgery operation.
   To enter the contest, you must submit by Oct. 1 a videotape of
yourself in which you address the vital topic, ``Why I'd like to
look better.'' A panel that includes Rivers and a plastic surgeon
will judge the tapes; five finalists will be chosen and the winner
announced later next month.
   The show does not say what happens to the four losers. But maybe
they will be allowed to appear in the new series, ``The Ugly
Family.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bob Geldof, musician, is back.
   Not St. Bob, the humanitarian of British tabloid headlines. Not
Sir Bob, knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 1986, nominated for the
Nobel Peace Prize that same year. Not author Bob, who's already
written a best-selling autobiography, ``Is That It?'' And not
businessman Bob, who oversaw millions and millions of dollars in
contributions for the starving Third World.
   Geldof remains chairman of the board of trustees for Band Aid,
although he says the organization will cease to exist fairly soon.
But his main focus these days is ``The Vegetarians of Love,'' his
critically acclaimed second solo album.
   This is no Boomtown Rats rock 'n' roll extravaganza; Geldof has
instead assembled a mostly acoustic band featuring accordion,
violins, flute, tin whistle, mandolin and ukulele.
   ``For me, I suppose, it's simply a reaction to stuff I hear on
the radio which I don't like _ basically, house music and New Kids
on the Block or Kylie Minogue,'' Geldof said in a recent interview.
   For the new album, Geldof enlisted an old friend _ ex-Rats
bassist Pete Briquette _ and four traditional musicians he'd never
met. They recorded 28 songs in five days; any song that didn't
click after three takes was thrown out. Geldof improvised many of
the lyrics on the spot.
   ``I came in on Monday morning, said hello to four guys I didn't
know ... I'd bash out a song and say, `Right! OK, let's go,' ''
Geldof recalled of the session.
   ``They'd say, `What do you want me to play?' I'd say, `Whatever
you want to play.' They'd say, `Where do you want me to play it?'
I'd say, `Wherever you feel its right.' And `When does the song
finish?' And I'd say, `When it stops, it's over.' ''
   The spontaneity shows. On ``A Gospel Song,'' Geldof tells the
band ``middle eight coming up'' during an instrumental break.
Geldof asks at the start of another cut, ``Are we rolling?'' And at
the end of ``The Great Song of Indifference,'' the entire band is
heard laughing loudly.
   ``Indifference'' is already a Top 40 hit in Britain. ``The last
thing everybody expected was this Irish pub song. And it became a
big dance hit, you know? Thirteenth-century dance music,'' says
Geldof, laughing.
   After almost a decade as front man for the New Wave-era Boomtown
Rats, Geldof became a household name in 1984 _ by organizing the
cream of British musicians to record ``Do They Know It's
Christmas?'' and raise money for African famine victims.
   That was followed by USA for Africa's ``We Are the World'' and
the internationally televised Live Aid benefit. For two years,
Geldof met with heads of state and political power brokers; the
scruffy Irishman was photographed with everyone from Nobelist
Mother Theresa to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   Geldof looks back on those days with pride tempered by the
realization there was only so much that could be done.
   ``I mean, I never said we were going to stop world poverty or
world hunger. I said it was a Band-Aid. `You don't put a Band-Aid
on a gaping wound,' if I remember, was the quote at the time,''
said Geldof.
   ``That wasn't the function, to stop world hunger. It was to
raise the issue to the top of the political agenda, and we did
that.''
   Geldof is still the nominal head of the organization: ``I'm the
chairman of the board of trustees, which requires me to go to a
meeting once every two months. In reality, the buck still stops
here.''
   But he says projects are winding down, and the end of Band Aid
could come in 1992.
   ``We have a million pounds left, which is contingency, which we
don't touch, in case there's an emergency or a shortfall on a
project,'' said Geldof. ``When all that's finished, about two
years, then we just close.''
   So Geldof is back with his first love, music. He's not sure if
``Vegetarians'' will be his long-awaited commercial breakthrough,
and he's aware that there's no immediate market for his songs on
U.S. radio.
   ``So what if it doesn't fit? It's still music,'' says Geldof.
``For every 3 million people who love Bon Jovi, there's a quarter
of a million who can't stand it. I'm not at all bitter. I'm sort of
philosophical.''
   The philosopher looks much the same as he did at Live Aid,
except for the bit of gray in his unruly mop of hair. Geldof
considers the music scene today, and he sees many of the same
things flourishing which led to the punk scene.
   ``I feel a real sort of betrayal now when I listen to the radio.
I understand that this is now a giant, monolithic industry, and I
understand so many millions of people depend on their livelihoods
for it, and they play it safe,'' said Geldof.

<HEAD>Cheers for Saddam Widen Gap Between Arabs and Jewish Majority</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KUFR KANNA, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Children in this biblical Arab town
used to copy stone-throwing Palestinians of the occupied
territories in a game called ``Intefadeh.'' Now they play ``Burn
the American flag.''
   They are responding to what many adults in Kufr Kanna and other
Arab towns in Israel have said since the U.S.-Iraqi showdown began:
Saddam Hussein is a hero who will unite Arabs against the United
States and its ally, Israel.
   Most Israeli Jews have been startled by such wide support for
the Iraqi president among Israel's 800,000 Arab citizens. Liberals
are disappointed and hard-liners cry ``treason,'' some even urging
that Arab citizens be expelled.
   ``The Arabs in Israel are crossing a red line, support for an
enemy who is threatening to annihilate half of Israel with chemical
weapons,'' said Eliezer Tsafrir, Arab affairs adviser to Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   ``We used to say the majority of our Arab citizens are loyal to
the state. We must go on saying that, but I'm not sure any longer
how accurate it is.''
   Tsafrir said ``Saddamania'' was further weakening Jewish-Arab
coexistence already hurt by Israeli Arab support for the
33-month-old Palestinian intefadeh, or uprising, in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Support for Saddam among Israeli Arabs springs partly from anger
about their treatment by the Jewish majority.
   They were under military government until 1966 and, today, their
communities get only about one-quarter the government funds given
to similar Jewish towns.
   Moslem fundamentalism also plays a role. The fundamentalists are
angry that American ``infidels'' have been sent into Saudi Arabia
near Moslem holy places.
   A study by Givat Haviva, a left-wing Israeli think tank, found
that Israeli Arab intellectuals initially condemned the Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, but rallied behind Saddam when U.S.
troops entered Arab lands.
   Outspoken support for Saddam is the rule in Kufr Kanna, a
hillside farming town of 12,000 north of Nazareth that is believed
to be where Jesus changed water into wine.
   Two weeks after Iraq's invasion, about 2,000 people marched
through town, carrying banners with such slogans as ``Saddam, hit
the Americans and Israel with chemical weapons.''
   The marchers burned an American flag and pictures of Hosni
Mubarak, president of Egypt, who has cooperated with the U.S.
defense of Saudi Arabia.
   Omar Saeed, a leader of the nationalist Sons of the Village
movement, said the demonstration inspired the children's game of
pretending to burn makeshift American flags.
   Saeed, a self-proclaimed socialist, sees Saddam as a fellow
revolutionary because he ousted Kuwait's oil-rich royal family.
   ``Saddam is leading the revolution of the poor; he is the Arabs'
Robin Hood,'' Saeed, 30, said in the living room of his father's
two-story home overlooking the town.
   He has an apartment in Haifa, where he is studying for a
doctorate in pharmacology at an Israeli university, and said most
of his Jewish neighbors call him a traitor.
   ``They are saying, `If you are with Saddam, you are against us,'
but my professor said he would fight for my right to speak my
mind,'' said Saeed, who spent four years under house arrest and six
months in prison for nationalist activities.
   His 65-year-old father, Radwan, described Saddam as a savior
fighting to unite Arabs, in the tradition of the late Egyptian
president, Gamal Abdel Nasser.
   Radwan Saeed, who been under town arrest for 10 years because of
nationalist activities, pointed to a picture of Nasser on the wall
and said: ``Tomorrow, we'll have a picture of Saddam up there as
well.''
   Jews are shocked by such sentiments from Arab countrymen, who
remained silent during Israel's wars with its Arab neighbors.
   ``I didn't expect to find them on friendly terms with such a
dictator,'' said Yossi Sarid of the left-wing Citizens Rights
Movement. ``Maybe they haven't digested deeply the democratic rules
of the game.''
   Conservative Israeli newspapers suggested the government crack
down on Arabs supporting Saddam.
   ``No one asks that they identify with Israeli policy, but no
state that values its existence can accept the identification of
its citizens with an enemy,'' said an editorial in the daily
Maariv. ``One does not play with fire.''
   On the extremist fringe, U.S.-born Rabbi Meir Kahane of the
anti-Arab Kach movement said Israeli Arabs should be expelled.
   ``I saw on television, how the Arabs of Kufr Kanna . . . our
Arabs, good Arabs, faithful Arabs, marched in support of this
dictator,'' Kahane said at a rally. ``Friends, if we want a common
policy, it is `Throw the Arabs out'.''
   Tsafrir said there were no plans for action against Israeli
Arabs unless they broke the law, but noted that growing resentment
by Jews would make it more difficult to redress the imbalance in
funding for Arab towns.
   In Kufr Kanna, Mayor Aref Hamdan said Arabs were angry over
``separate and unequal'' policies under which a permit for building
a factory had been denied. The town's unemployment rate is about 25
percent, more than twice the Jewish rate.
   Mohammed Abbas, unemployed after losing jobs in his field of
biology and as a waiter, said: ``The Jews think we are weak,
inferior people. We have to explain ourselves to them all the time,
say that we are loyal to the state. They never explain themselves
to us.''

   Purple and red bougainvillea are
back in bloom, seaside resorts are open and cruise ships call again
at most of the dozen Caribbean islands battered by Hurricane Hugo.
   St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands and the British colony of
Montserrat still are rebuilding, but elsewhere there is little
remaining evidence of the worst storm in a decade, which killed at
least 56 people and caused more than $2 billion in damage on Sept.
17-18, 1989.
   ``I think we've recovered better than expected,'' said Carl
Mitchell, director of the Economic Secretariat of the seven-member
Organization of Eastern Caribbean States in St. John's, Antigua.
   ``Initially, we had looked at the possible long-term effects and
had indicated it was going to take three years before there would
be full recovery,'' he said. ``But I think this may apply just to
Montserrat. The recovery in the other islands has been quite
startling.''
   Nevertheless, Mitchell said, the hurricane caused a drop in
economic growth rates and a sharp rise in the cost of living in
Montserrat and the neighboring islands of Antigua, Dominica and St.
Kitts-Nevis.
   On St. Croix, where one-third of the homes were demolished or
heavily damaged by winds of up to 200 mph, life is returning to
normal gradually.
   Two insurance companies went out of business, leaving more than
$55 million in claims to 1,000 homeowners and 200 businesses
unpaid. The territorial government has agreed to cover policyholder
losses of up to $100,000 each, but hundreds of families are still
waiting to have their homes rebuilt.
   One million cubic yards of debris has been cleared from the
island and restaurants and stores in Christiansted, the main town,
are operating. The landscape, once brown from defoliation, is
greener now.
   The Education Department said all but one of the island's 10
schools were reopening for the fall term after repairs made with a
$43 million federal grant.
   Thirty-three cruise ships are to resume port calls in October.
Betty Sperber, president of the Hotel and Tourism Association on
St. Croix, said 10 of the 15 major hotels would be open by then,
but the other five were closing permanently.
   St. Croix's image as an American paradise suffered both from the
hurricane's destruction and four days of looting that followed.
   President Bush sent 1,100 military police to restore order. They
stayed for two months and the island was under curfew.
   Residents still have angry memories of news reports at the time
about marauding gangs of blacks attacking wealthy whites with
machetes.
   Police Chief Delroy Richards says more than 100 people,
including some prominent residents, were arrested on theft charges
but ``none of the cases can I say were racially motivated.''
   ``I feel the looting is behind us,'' he said. ``People have
condemned those persons who took items that were not needed.''
   St. Croix, population 56,000, was by far the hardest hit of the
three main U.S. Virgin Islands. It has received the bulk of $750
million provided to the territory by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, known as FEMA.
   Hugo also heavily damaged St. Thomas, whose population is about
the same; sparsely populated St. John, and the neighboring British
Virgin Islands, but all of them recuperated quickly.
   Puerto Rico, a U.S. commonwealth of 3.6 million people 70 miles
west of St. Croix, returned to normal within weeks of the hurricane
despite an estimated $1.3 billion in damage and lost production.
   Jose Bravo, the FEMA coordinator in San Juan, said 900 families
still were living in temporary modular housing, mostly in
northeastern Puerto Rico and on the offshore islands of Culebra and
Vieques.
   He said FEMA provided $72 million to the commonwealth government
for new housing but construction has been delayed by permits,
contracts and land development.
   Only $1.1 million of $14.2 million raised for hurricane victims
by a 12-hour simultaneous telethon in San Juan, New York and Miami
had been distributed by the end of August, 11 months later.
   Luis Davila, administrator of the telethon fund, said all
applicants should have their money within three months. She said
the fund also would build 330 homes, all expected to be ready by
Christmas.
   Montserrat, a small, pear-shaped island with only 12,500
residents 200 miles south of Puerto Rico, was all but flattened by
the hurricane and remains far from completely recovered.
   Reuben Meade, the government's director of development, said
about 90 percent of the island's 4,000 homes had been rebuilt and
businesses had reopened in Plymouth, the capital.
   Electricity, water and telephone services have been restored and
the two major hotels have reopened, he said, but roads need
repairs, the port still uses a barge as its main jetty and little
work has been done on government buildings.
   In Guadeloupe, which has 340,000 inhabitants and was the first
island in Hugo's path, wood and corrugated iron is heaped in places
and schools and houses still are being rebuilt.
   Franklin McDonald, director of the Pan-Caribbean Disaster
Preparedness and Prevention Project in Antigua, said the French
government responded quickly.
   ``There are still housing repairs being done, but to a great
extent Guadeloupe is back to normal,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   In the chronic crises of the Middle East, the
Cold War and its remnants always have shaped the moves and
countermoves of the superpowers _ until now. In this crisis, the
rules have changed.
   That shows in the sudden summit meeting between President Bush
and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   The framework of East-West struggle is gone. U.S. and Soviet
leaders, whose predecessors bristled and charged aggression when
one side or the other made or backed military moves in the Middle
East, now are allied against the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   Bush stressed the joint effort, not the limits and points of
friction, as he headed to Helsinki for the brief summit he
suggested about two weeks ago.
   Bush said there was no specific agenda for five hours of
meetings on Sunday but, rather, a need for free-flowing, personal
consultation on a wide array of questions, with the Middle East
chief among them.
   European security, negotiations to limit conventional weapons
there, and other issues are due for discussion, too, as are the
economic strains facing Gorbachev at home.
   The Helsinki conference is a symbol of the basic changes wrought
by the breakup of the Soviet bloc and the passing of the Cold War.
That remodeling of the world political map outweighs and will
outlast the current crisis and others that certainly will follow in
the Middle East.
   It has been a cockpit of East-West struggle for the better part
of 50 years and in a way, the Moscow-Washington rivalry disciplined
the recurring conflicts.
   Each side backed client states to counter the other, and each
side was able to rein its allies before their clashes escalated
into a risk of superpower confrontation.
   ``There is no more East-West game,'' said Judith Kipper, a
Middle East scholar at the Brookings Institution. ``It will make
some people yearn for the Cold War, when there were rules ... ''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is proposing a new
regional security system to seek stability and order in the Middle
East, suggesting that there could be a long-term U.S. presence in
the area as part of such a system.
   At the White House, Bush's spokesman said there was no way to
know whether such an alliance might include the Soviet Union.
   In another era, the Soviet Union, Iraq's chief arms supplier,
might have been able to restrain Saddam Hussein short of the
invasion of Kuwait, another Middle East expert said.
   ``This is the first Middle East crisis in which the Soviet Union
is essentially a secondary player,'' said Robert E. Hunter of the
Center for Strategic and International Studies.
   Hunter, an aide and adviser to Democratic administrations and to
a congressional delegation just back from the crisis zone, said
Moscow is preoccupied with internal economic and political problems.
   But the administration has played up the Soviet role and even
suggested that it might now reconsider economic aid to Moscow.
   The White House was conciliatory on other points, too. While the
Soviet Union has cut off arms shipments to Iraq and joined the U.N.
trade embargo, it still has about 193 military advisers there,
among about 1,000 Soviet citizens involved in training and
maintenance.
   Baker has called their role inappropriate and there have been
congressional demands that the advisers be withdrawn. But White
House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater called it a marginal matter,
since the embargo is working.
   ``There's no sense getting argumentative with the Soviets on
this issue,'' he said.
   On such points, the rule is accommodation.
   ``A new foundation for world order is being built, and the
spadework begins in Helsinki,'' Fitzwater said.
   The accommodating words are mutual. After a Soviet military
leader complained that the U.S. buildup in the Gulf could get
impede negotiations for weapons cuts in Europe, a foreign ministry
spokesman disputed the idea.
   Gennadi Gerasimov said the U.S. deployment in Saudi Arabia was
at the invitation of that government, in a legitimate response to
the invasion of Kuwait.
   Only three years ago, Moscow was denouncing the U.S. naval
operation to protect Persian Gulf tanker traffic as a move that
threatened war.
   But that was the old order.

   ``FAMILY MAN'' (premieres Sept. 22):
   Battling NBC's ``Parenthood'' for viewers, this wholesome new
arrival could be called ``My Three Sons, One Daughter and No
Laughs.''
   It stars Gregory Harrison, late of ``Trapper John, M.D.'' Now he
essays a harried, freshly widowed fire department captain left with
three sons, two of whom are teen-agers, and a kindergarten-age
daughter.
   He also has a kindly father-in law (Al Molinaro) in from New
York to help him.
   This Southern California clan lives in a two-story Spanish-style
home that appears to be the kind that costs maybe $300,000 more
than a fire captain's salary could afford. But heck, maybe this
smoke-eater works in Beverly Hills.
   But the fireman's writers appear to have burnt down, leaving
this motherless family facing such emergencies as burnt pancakes,
still-wet socks and absolutely no funny lines whatsover.
   Sure, there's a lot of warmth, and also a sad moment that leads
to a release of pent-up grief by the youngest son. But ``Family
Man'' is one of the season's most feeble entries.
   All you can say of it is that the actress playing the tiny
daughter has a great deal of peewee charm and appeal. Said actress,
Ashleigh Blair Sterling (why don't they call girls Julie any
more?), is not yet double-digit in years. But she has a fine sense
of timing and will probably do well in later years.
   She should not include ``Family Man'' on her dossier.
   
   ``E.A.R.T.H. FORCE'' (premieres Sept. 22, with Sept. 16 preview):
   Billed by its makers as network TV's first action-ecological
series, this one proves why environmentally concerned Hollywood
writers and producers should be banned as hazardous:
   They threaten the world with deadly clouds of earnest dialogue.
   The series is about a sort of ecological A-Team, funded by the
spare-no-expense Earth Alert Foundation. The team is led by sturdy
Gil Gerard. He plays a brilliant surgeon whose background includes
Vietnam.
   The team has five members, one of them a beautiful woman. Four
hold advanced degrees in such things as marine biology and
anthropology. One even has a double major, nuclear physics and
radical protest. The fifth, a raffish Australian, is a
counter-terrorism expert who also owns a C-130 cargo plane, a
helicopter, a cigar and a pair of driving gloves with the
fingertips cut off.
   The modest goal of the team is to Save The Earth.
   In the show's preview, they're brought together _ by force in
some cases _ by a wicked conglomerate president whose troubled
nuclear power plant is approaching meltdown.
   No government intervention, no press, the mogul says. You guys
take care of it and I'll fund your projects forever.
   The team discovers double trouble: The plant is missing two
kilograms of deadly plutonium stolen during the approaching
meltdown, and the meltdown was programmed by an insider but wasn't
supposed to be for real. It is, though. And as for the plutonium,
it to be sold to a mysterious Middle East country.
   This is bad enough, but the dialogue is even worse.
   Try this, about the potential effect of a nuclear meltdown:
``You won't see a deer or rabbit around here for the next 500
years.'' Or this, in which the industrialist's lovely aide
describes a member of the planet-saving team:
   ``He's the one who threw sheep's blood on your limo in New York
last summer ... even Greenpeace finds him too radical.''
   At the finale, Gerard reports that ``we've lived on this planet
for 50,000 years, and in the last 200 we've damned near killed
it.'' Whereupon the team's staff radical comes right out and says:
   ``We've got to go after the slime that are dumping and
polluting.''
   He may be right. But if the two-hour preview written by Bill
Corcoran is any indication, he'd show more real concern for the TV
environment if he'd put ``E.A.R.T.H. Force'' inside a TV producer's
heart.

   ``PARENTHOOD'' (premieres Sept. 22):
   Based on the movie comedy of the same name, this one stars Ed
Begley Jr. as a financial analyst who, with his college-educated
wife (Jayne Atkinson), is raising a family of four.
   This effort is not a one-family adventure, though. There are
three other families running loose here, all related. One includes
a great-grandmother, the mother-in-law of Begley's dad, well-acted
by William Windom.
   You'll probably like Begley's gruff old dad the best, if only
because he often gives the impression there is nothing more he'd
like to do than take a baseball bat and restore order in his gruff
old way.
   The show's point seems to be that there's much warmth, heartache
and confusion in family life. This is not hot news, and the monster
cast tends to resemble a human gridlock that occasionally sits down
to dinner.
   Matters could improve. The cast is good. But with less than 25
minutes to play with each week, the writers should be constantly
advised of the excellent principle of K.I.S.S. _ Keep It Simple,
Stupid.
   
   ``AMERICAN DREAMER'' _ (premieres Sept. 22; preview not
available).
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FOX</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   ``HAYWIRE'' (premiered Sept. 1):
   This follows ``Totally Hidden Video,'' and can be called
``Totally Dumb Television.'' It's full of the sort of stupid silly
things people do when they get their first video camera _ only
worse.
   Among other things, the opening show dispatched a staffer to
Seattle to see what people would give him for free if he was from a
TV show. The take included handcuffs, a monkfish and two blondes.
   Fox seems confused by ``Haywire.'' The premiere was hosted by
Matthew Perry, a new graduate of the Bob Saget School of Home Video
Show Hosting. But Perry is out now, Fox says, and Alan Hunter is
getting a tryout.
   Hunter is identified as a former MTV veejay. If he is still
around by next week, we will alert you by shouting ``Bingo!''
   
   ``AMERICAN CHRONICLES'' (premieres Sept. 8):
   This is a unique show by ``Twin Peaks'' makers Mark Frost and
David Lynch, the good kind that appeals to ears and eyeballs alike.
   A beautifully photographed, impressionistic look at the sights
and sounds of America, the first show, narrated by Richard
Dreyfuss, examines Mardi Gras in New Orleans, from its humble
beginnings in 1699 to the gaudy present.
   (The gaudy present here includes the baring of female bosoms 14
times in this year's French Quarter frolic. The baring is
electronically blurred, but it's the thought that counts.)
   The video impressionism is nicely scored by Billy Barber,
usually with a sort-of-classical music that goes from a whisper to
a Wagnerian roar, with the morning-after finale done only with a
wistful clarinet and banjo rendition of ``Till I Had You.''
   True, the first video maestro of Americana was Jean Shepherd.
His sardonic ``Jean Shepherd's America'' series on PBS in the '70s
remains one of the best TV looks at the nation ever to come down
the airwaves.
   But ``American Chronicles'' may prove a very close contender for
second place.

<HEAD>Number of Black Farmers Dwindling; Farm Bill Would Address Their
Needs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of freed slaves were wooed to
farming after the Civil War with political promises of ``40 acres
and a mule.''
   The pledge went the way of so many campaign come-ons. Still
farming was a trade that many of the newly freed blacks knew. By
the end of the century, minorities had acquired 15 million acres
for farming.
   ``We never were given the 40 acres and the mule, but a lot of
people were allowed to buy,'' said Ralph Paige, executive director
of the Federation of Southern Cooperatives-Land Assistance Fund.
   But now the number of minority-owned farms is dwindling
drastically, and members of Congress are trying to stop the
decline. The 1990 farm bill includes provisions inserted by Sen.
Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., and Rep. Mike Espy, D-Miss., that give special
attention to the needs of the minority farmer.
   ``I think the government should be concerned about all small
farmers. They're the backbone of this country,'' said Paige, who
lobbied for the minority farming language in the farm bill.
``Minority farms are a different breed. These are farmers who have
the historical problem of discrimination.''
   Only 4.5 million acres _ out 988 million _ are now farmed by
minorities, Paige said.
   He attributed the losses among minority farmers to
discrimination in credit, lack of access to markets and lack of
knowledge about wills and other paperwork necessary to retain
ownership of land.
   Years ago, the severe losses of minority farms were blamed on an
outmoded sharecropping system. But in the 1960s, the U.S.
Commission on Civil Rights found systematic racial discrimination
in the Agriculture Department. In 1982, after noting that
minority-owned farms were disappearing at 2.5 times the rate of
white-owned farms, the commission recommended federal and state
action to remedy the situation.
   The farm bill passed by the Senate includes more remedies for
the decline in minority-owned farms than the House measure. A
congressional conference committee will begin work this month to
resolve the differences on these and other provisions of the farm
bill.
   ``Minority farmers traditionally have received less federal
assistance than their white counterparts, and have been more
vulnerable to changes in agriculture,'' said Fowler. ``When they
hurt, the communities around them hurt.''
   From 1978 to 1987, the number of minority-owned farms declined
23 percent, while white-owned farms declined 7.1 percent, said
Fowler.
   ``That means nearly one in four minority farms disappeared in
just one decade,'' he said.
   Virtually all of this loss came from the ranks of black farmers,
though minority farmers include Asians, Hispanics and American
Indians, said the Rural Coalition in a report based on the 1987
Census of Agriculture.
   Nine out of 10 of the failed black farms were in the South, the
coalition said.
   The coalition reported that while a third of the white farms
receive direct government payments, less than half that percentage
of minority farms do. ``A white farm is four times more likely to
obtain a loan from the federal government's Commodity Credit Corp.
than a minority farm,'' it said.
   Half of all white farms have sales above $10,000, but just 30
percent of minority farms have sales at this level, according to
the coalition's findings.
   The House bill would expand outreach and education to increase
minority participation in Agriculture Department programs.
   The Senate includes a similar provision, and also would:
   _Establish a national registry of minority farmers to monitor
ownership.
   _Assign extension agents to areas with high population of
minority farmers to involve them in existing USDA programs.
   _Create demonstration programs for minority youth and beginning
farmers.
   _Direct the agriculture secretary to review the effectiveness of
the current appeals process for discrimination complaints and
affirmative action policies.
   _Review the impact of the Agriculture Department's purchasing
and contracting policies on minority businesses.
   Espy has offered a separate, more far-reaching minority farm
bill. It is unlikely to be acted upon this year.

   Here are capsule reviews of the networks' new
prime-time television series on Sundays:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ABC</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   ``AMERICA'S FUNNIEST PEOPLE'' (premieres Sept. 16):
   This is the second half of ``America's Funniest Home Videos.''
   To understand this show, first you must watch Part I with host
Bob Saget, a standup comedian who stars on ABC's ``Full House,''
the top-rated sitcom among children ages 2 to 11.
   The host of ``America's Funniest People'' is Dave Coulier, a
standup comedian who also stars on the ABC sitcom ``Full House.''
   Do you enjoy ``America's Funniest Home Videos''? Is it funny? Do
you laugh at home videos of other peoples' pratfalls, misfortunes
and stupidity _ even if a bit nervously? Maybe a bit guiltily?
   Don't feel bad. That's the appeal of these shows. It's a coarse,
sometimes cruel brand of homemade slapstick. Call it the frontier
humor of the Electronic Age.
   If you dislike ``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' you probably
will feel the same way about ``America's Funniest People,'' which
features people doing Rodney Dangerfield impressions, making rude
noises and performing strange stunts on demand.
   If you really dislike ``America's Funniest People,'' take solace
that NBC's Brandon Tartikoff believes it will shorten the life of
home video programming.
   If you really love ``America's Funniest People'' and can play
``God Bless America'' with your armpit, please contact the show's
producers.

   ``HULL HIGH'' (premieres Sept. 30, preview aired Aug. 20):
   ``Hull High'' threatened to be another empty-headed knockoff of
the pretentious teen musical ``Fame,'' but turns out to be a
bright, funny, musical comedy about a California high school that's
beguiling from its first scene.
   In addition to superior production values and an excellent cast,
``Hull High'' is well-written and tightly edited. It's directed by
Kenny Ortega, who choreographed ``Dirty Dancing'' and keeps things
moving.
   ``Hull High'' opens with a house-dancing production number and
introduces the four rappers, lads who function as a kind of Greek
chorus to the action. Adults will enjoy a bilious teacher's
jaundiced reaction to them.
   There's a lovely teacher (Nancy Valen) who can't understand why
her male students don't seem to comprehend the material. The
popular teacher (Will Lyman) sits in on her class, and his fantasy
becomes a production number on the figures of speech. Simile and
metaphor were never so well-danced.
   Then there's the student (Mark Ballou) who falls for the
wistfully beautiful transfer student (Cheryl Pollak). Will the
course of true teen love run smooth? Nah. Will they get back
together? Go figure.
   ``Hull High'' is beautifully photographed, its music is melodic,
and it keeps the teen-age angst at an acceptable level.
   It's fun to watch, filled with throwaway bits that are grace
notes to the longer scenes. Its humor is suprisingly sophisticated
and sometimes even subtle.
   ``Hull High,'' celebrates people who are young and alive and
about 16 years old with nary a thought in their heads. It even
admires the people who teach them.
   
   ``LIFESTORIES'' (premieres Sept. 30, preview aired Aug. 20):
   NBC has great hopes for this medical series, which looks at
life-threatening illnesses from the patient's perspective.
   It's a clever idea for a drama and, given current American
attitudes toward the medical industry, it's probably all for the
best that this is not a doctor show.
   Judging from its pilot episode, however, the patient is in
trouble.
   The episode is about colorectal cancer, America's second-most
common cancer after lung cancer. Last year, colorectal cancer
killed 61,000 Americans. It is preventable and, if detected early,
has surprisingly high recovery rates.
   Introducing patients and their illnesses gives ``Lifestories''
an inherently difficult exposition. But writer Jeffrey Lewis
resorts to a narrator, Robert Prosky, in the persona of an
omniscient clinic founder.
   Prosky's know-all narration gives us the facts on colon cancer,
explains peoples' motivations and generally intrudes on the story.
It's so sentimental and superfluous that it actually ruins the
story and the acting.
   In the first scene, the narrator introduces us to Don, a real
estate developer who makes the putt of his life and raises his arms
in triumph. Freeze frame. Cut to Don's gut, special effect, a
sectional view, where a single cell has started its perverse
multiplication.
   ``Lifestories'' promises more freeze-frame, cutaway views of
central characters and their innards. TV characters walking about
like medical textbook illustrations is not something to look
forward to.
   The very talented Richard Masur plays Don. Lisa Barnes plays his
wife, and Kieran Mulroney his son. The three create a real sense of
how a family's dynamics are altered when cancer strikes it.
   Yet when these people create a mood, the narrator steps in and
ruins it.
   As information, ``Lifestories'' is good. As entertainment, it is
not.

   ``TRUE COLORS'' (premieres Sept. 9):
   It's difficult to believe groundbreaking can be done so tamely,
or that the weblet which brought us the Bundys and the Simpsons
would buy into this very mild sitcom about a biracial marriage.
   ``True Colors'' features Nancy Walker, fresh from the paper
towel races, portraying an old-fashioned, domineering,
wise-cracking mother-in-law. Is this a stretch for her as an
actress, or what?
   Frankie Faison plays a dentist, the widowed father of two sons;
his new wife is played by Stephanie Faracy (late of CBS' ``His and
Hers''), a bubbly-sweet kindergarten teacher and mother of a
teen-age daughter.
   The offspring are played by Claude Brooks as the elder son, a
Joe Cool materialist; Brigid Conley Walsh as a naive, cause-minded
liberal; and Adam Jeffries as a hip-hop-talking 14-year-old.
   This is the most well-adjusted group of human beings since the
Huxtables of ``The Cosby Show.'' There's no real tension between
the kids, the parents are wonderful role models and consequently
nobody is particularly funny.
   Only once does ``True Colors'' obliquely refer to the tragedy
that is its central theme, when the police come to the family home
on a mistaken burglary call. Miraculously, nobody gets shot.
   It would be wonderful if racism would just go away. It won't,
though, and there's no point in ignoring it simply because you're
trying to do comedy.
   
   ``PARKER LEWIS CAN'T LOSE'' (preview aired Sept. 1, premieres
Sept. 9):
   Well, maybe he can, but it won't be his fault. ``Not a
problem,'' Parker says, repeatedly, in this winning high-school
farce. Its writers, Lon Diamond and producer Clyde Phillips, have
done their homework.
   Corin Nemec plays Parker, a bright, wholesome, basically decent
teen-age lad you might trust with your sister _ until you found him
promoting her for the minimalist page in Sports Illustrated's
swimsuit edition.
   Parker's pastime, joy and full-time hustle is to exploit his
fellow students, maximize profits and minimize the tedium of
getting a high school diploma. Inevitably, these traits put him at
odds with the principal, Ms. Musso (Melanie Chartoff), a dragon
lady determined to get Parker expelled and yet helplessly unable to
thwart his outlandish excuses, scams and schemes.
   The style of ``Parker Lewis Can't Lose'' is one of its most
endearing qualities. People don't just move quickly, they WHOOSH.
The school bully doesn't just stand, he looms like a mountain to
the faint buzzing of flies.
   As it stands, ``Parker Lewis Can't Lose'' is a droll, delightful
fantasy. If writers Diamond and Phillips put their minds to it,
they could make this show the greatest high school sitcom since
``The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis.''
   
   ``GET A LIFE'' (premieres Sept. 23):
   What's the matter with a 30-year-old man who still lives with
his parents and has a paper route? Absolutely nothing, provided the
aging adolescent is played by Chris Elliot.
   One of the blither spirits to hit television, Elliott rose from
the writing staff of ``Late Night with David Letterman'' to portray
The Guy Under the Seats, The Fugitive Guy and other very skewed
'80s-kinds-of-guys.
   His first venture into series comedy is pretty good stuff. He
plays Chris Peterson, a guy who simply chose not to have a career
and a full-time job. He just kept his old paper route and lived in
his old room.
   His long-suffering parents are wonderfully played by Chris' real
father, the comedian Bob Elliott, and the lovely June Lockhart.
   They rejoiced when their son said he wanted to move out. Then he
moved into an apartment over their garage.
   Chris' best friend, Larry, is played by Sam Robards. Larry
bought into the rat race and his frequent second thoughts about
being a grownup make him easy prey to Chris' schemes and adventures.
   Robin Riker plays Larry's wife who has less than no use for
Chris.
   ``Get a Life'' is about an immature, selfish, narcissistic Peter
Pan who refuses to grow up and take life seriously. The frightening
thing is that he may be right.

   ``FRESH PRINCE OF BEL AIR'' (premieres Sept. 10):
   An amiable but not memorable exercise.
   This sitcom has rap music star Will Smith as a street-wise
teen-ager from a tough black section of Philadelphia sent to live
with wealthy relatives in the posh Bel Air section of Los Angeles.
His new family consists of his sympathetic aunt, her stuffy lawyer
husband, three kids _ two of 'em teen-age twits _ and a butler who
insists on calling the newcomer Master William.
   This clash of cultures has promise. But its opening round is
tame, mainly because it lacks comic tension. Instead of being
suspicious of his new surroundings and the inmates thereof, Master
William is ceaselessly good-natured, impish and decent.
   The only time a point of view peeps out is when, in an angry
exchange with his stuffy uncle (James Avery), he says: ``I remind
you of where you came from and where you used to be. But you got
soft. You forgot who you are and where you came from.''
   There are a few funny moments in this look at the black upper
crust in a predominantly white enclave. Example: Smith tells his
preppy cousin Carlton (Alfonso Ribeiro) that Malcolm X is his hero,
then asks the lad who he admires. ``My dad,'' the preppie says.
``And Bryant Gumbel. He's darned good.''
   There also is a small surprise now and then, as in a closing
scene, when Smith quietly picks out a passage of classical music on
the piano.
   But they'd best put some more punch in this series, or ``Fresh
Prince'' will quickly become stale sitcom.
   
   ``FERRIS BUELLER'' (premieres Sept. 17):
   This is a half-hour tribute to the proposition that anybody can
write a realllllllly dumb sitcom.
   Based on the movie ``Ferris Bueller's Day Off,'' it mostly
occurs in a Southern California high school, just like NBC's new
``Hull High'' and Fox's new ``Class of Beverly Hills'' and ``Parker
Lewis Can't Lose.''
   Like ``Parker Lewis,'' a distant sitcom cousin of ``Ferris
Bueller,'' NBC's show is about a glib, charming student who aims to
get through school with little work and much fun.
   He's much like, say, a network comedy development executive.
   Charlie Schlatter plays Ferris, a junior so cool he can
computer-hack false attendance records, change the school menu or
get a stretch limo for a ride to school.
   With the push of a remote-control button, he even can send his
nemesis _ surprise, surprise, it's the forever-fuming high school
principal _ plunging through a trap door on the opening day of
school.
   The only thing Ferris Bueller can't do is get a funny script.
Let us join hands now and pray for an end to sitcoms set in
Southern California high schools. Or at least an end to sitcom
writers who attended Southern California high schools.

   ``LAW &amp; ORDER'' (premieres in October, date to be announced):
   Critics of longtime television producer Dick Wolf say he
presided over the decline of ``Miami Vice'' as its producer and the
demise of ``Hill Street Blues'' as its ``executive story
consultant.''
   He created ``H.E.L.P.,'' an action-adventure about a fictitious
New York City fire-police-rescue unit, and it was last year's
lowest-rated series. His ``Nasty Boys,'' a ninja-narco-SWAT action
show, sank without a trace.
   Still, he persists, and may have found a winning formula with
his latest creation, ``Law &amp; Order.''
   It's a police procedural for its first half-hour, starring the
venerable George Dzunda and Christopher Noth as a couple of New
York City detectives. They are patient, dogged, unglamorous and
utterly believable.
   The second half-hour stars the distinguished Michael Moriarty as
a hard-working assistant district attorney; Richard Brooks plays
his colleague and Stephen Hill is the district attorney.
   The pilot episode has teads
to a release of pent-up grief by the youngest son. But ``Family
Man'' is one of the season's most feeble entries.
   All you can say of it is that the actress playing the tiny
daughter has a great deal of peewee charm and appeal. Said actress,
Ashleigh Blair Sterling (why don't they call girls Julie any
more?), is not yet double-digit in years. But she has a fine sense
of timing and will probably do well in later years.
   She should not include ``Family Man'' on her dossier.
   
   ``E.A.R.T.H. FORCE'' (premieres Sept. 22, with Sept. 16 preview):
   Billed by its makers as network TV's first action-ecological
series, this one proves why environmentally concerned Hollywood
writers and producers should be banned as hazardous:
   They threaten the world with deadly clouds of earnest dialogue.
   The series is about a sort of ecological A-Team, funded by the
spare-no-expense Earth Alert Foundation. The team is led by sturdy
Gil Gerard. He plays a brilliant surgeon whose background includes
Vietnam.
   The team has five members, one of them a beautiful woman. Four
hold advanced degrees in such things as marine biology and
anthropology. One even has a double major, nuclear physics and
radical protest. The fifth, a raffish Australian, is a
counter-terrorism expert who also owns a C-130 cargo plane, a
helicopter, a cigar and a pair of driving gloves with the
fingertips cut off.
   The modest goal of the team is to Save The Earth.
   In the show's preview, they're brought together _ by force in
some cases _ by a wicked conglomerate president whose troubled
nuclear power plant is approaching meltdown.
   No government intervention, no press, the mogul says. You guys
take care of it and I'll fund your projects forever.
   The team discovers double trouble: The plant is missing two
kilograms of deadly plutonium stolen during the approaching
meltdown, and the meltdown was programmed by an insider but wasn't
supposed to be for real. It is, though. And as for the plutonium,
it to be sold to a mysterious Middle East country.
   This is bad enough, but the dialogue is even worse.
   Try this, about the potential effect of a nuclear meltdown:
``You won't see a deer or rabbit around here for the next 500
years.'' Or this, in which the industrialist's lovely aide
describes a member of the planet-saving team:
   ``He's the one who threw sheep's blood on your limo in New York
last summer ... even Greenpeace finds him too radical.''
   At the finale, Gerard reports that ``we've lived on this planet
for 50,000 years, and in the last 200 we've damned near killed
it.'' Whereupon the team's staff radical comes right out and says:
   ``We've got to go after the slime that are dumping and
polluting.''
   He may be right. But if the two-hour preview written by Bill
Corcoran is any indication, he'd show more real concern for the TV
environment if he'd put ``E.A.R.T.H. Force'' inside a TV producer's
heart.

   ``PARENTHOOD'' (premieres Sept. 22):
   Based on the movie comedy of the same name, this one stars Ed
Begley Jr. as a financial analyst who, with his college-educated
wife (Jayne Atkinson), is raising a family of four.
   This effort is not a one-family adventure, though. There are
three other families running loose here, all related. One includes
a great-grandmother, the mother-in-law of Begley's dad, well-acted
by William Windom.
   You'll probably like Begley's gruff old dad the best, if only
because he often gives the impression there is nothing more he'd
like to do than take a baseball bat and restore order in his gruff
old way.
   The show's point seems to be that there's much warmth, heartache
and confusion in family life. This is not hot news, and the monster
cast tends to resemble a human gridlock that occasionally sits down
to dinner.
   Matters could improve. The cast is good. But with less than 25
minutes to play with each week, the writers should be constantly
advised of the excellent principle of K.I.S.S. _ Keep It Simpltupid.
   
   ``AMERICAN DREAMER'' _ (premieres Sept. 22; preview not
available).
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FOX</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   ``HAYWIRE'' (premiered Sept. 1):
   This follows ``Totally Hidden Video,'' and can be called
``Totally Dumb Television.'' It's full of the sort of stupid silly
things people do when they get their first video camera _ only
worse.
   Among other things, the opening show dispatched a staffer to
Seattle to see what people would give him for free if he was from a
TV show. The take included handcuffs, a monkfish and two blondes.
   Fox seems confused by ``Haywire.'' The premiere was hosted by
Matthew Perry, a new graduate of the Bob Saget School of Home Video
Show Hosting. But Perry is out now, Fox says, and Alan Hunter is
getting a tryout.
   Hunter is identified as a former MTV veejay. If he is still
around by next week, we will alert you by shouting ``Bingo!''
   
   ``AMERICAN CHRONICLES'' (premieres Sept. 8):
   This is a unique show by ``Twin Peaks'' makers Mark Frost and
David Lynch, the good kind that appeals to ears and eyeballs alike.
   A beautifully photographed, impressionistic look at the sights
and sounds of America, the first show, narrated by Richard
Dreyfuss, examines Mardi Gras in New Orleans, from its humble
beginnings in 1699 to the gaudy present.
   (The gaudy present here includes the baring of female bosoms 14
times in this year's French Quarter frolic. The baring is
electronically blurred, but it's the thought that counts.)
   The video impressionism is nicely scored by Billy Barber,
usually with a sort-of-classical music that goes from a whisper to
a Wagnerian roar, with the morning-after finale done only with a
wistful clarinet and banjo rendition of ``Till I Had You.''
   True, the first video maestro of Americana was Jean Shepherd.
His sardonic ``Jean Shepherd's America'' series on PBS in the '70s
remains one of the best TV looks at the nation ever to come down
the airwaves.
   But ``American Contender'' may prove a very close contender for
second place.

   Oil prices soared over $30 a barrel, reaching
that plateau for the second time during the Persian Gulf crisis as
traders bet that supply shortages will develop.
   Light sweet crude rose throughout a hectic day of trading on the
New York Mercantile Exchange, closing up $1.66 at $31.43 per barrel
for October contracts on Thursday.
   Analysts attributed the surge to reports that supplies could be
short this winter as well as a lack of any signs that the Middle
East crisis could be resolved soon.

   Commercial banks earned $5.3 billion from
April through June of this year, down 24 percent from the same
period a year ago, the government said.
   Banks in the Northeast dragged down profits for the entire
industry, which had posted a record $7 billion in profits in the
second quarter of 1989, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said
Thursday.
   The financial performance of banks in the Midwest, South and
West showed improvement in the second quarter, while loan problems
continued to grow in the Northeast and Southeast, according to the

   Contract talks between the United Auto Workers
and General Motors Corp. are moving faster than past talks, a union
executive said roughly a week before the pact expires.
   UAW Vice President Stephen Yokich told reporters Thursday that
about half of the non-economic issues before negotiators have been
resolved in tentative agreements. He declined to elaborate.
   UAW contracts with GM, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. cover
more than 450,000 active workers and expire Sept. 14. A new UAW-GM
contract, which would cover more than 300,000 of the employees, is
expected to be used as a pattern for talks with Ford and Chrysler.

   A federal appeals panel ordered
government regulators to retake control of Franklin Savings
Association on Thursday _ just hours after the thrift's managers
had moved back into their offices.
   Operators of the largest thrift in Kansas were allowed back in
the offices in the morning, after U.S. District Judge Dale E.
Saffels ruled Wednesday that regulators had improperly seized the
company.
   But the government obtained a stay Thursday afternoon from the
10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver.
   In response, Saffels ordered the Resolution Trust Corp. to
retake control of the thrift.

   A new corporation backed by the oil industry
plans to spend $800 million over the next five years on a
nationwide system designed to clean up the worst oil spills.
   The cost is three times the original estimate for setting up the
Marine Spill Response Corp., but President John D. Costello said
Thursday the increases were necessary to do the job.
   The company plans to construct five regional centers in areas
where major oil spills are most likely to occur: the New York-New
Jersey area; Port Everglades, Fla., north of Miami; Lake Charles,
La., near the Texas border; Port Hureneme, Calif., north of Los
Angeles; and Seattle.

   American businesses plan to increase spending
for new plants and equipment just 5.1 percent over 1989, the
smallest growth in three years, the government said.
   Analysts said the Commerce Department survey, released Thursday,
shows that businesses remain leery of a softening economy and
worried about falling profits. The survey found businesses planning
to spend $526.9 billion for expansion and modernization this year.

   Atlantic Richfield Co. introduced its second
less-polluting gasoline, a premium unleaded it said would burn
cleaner and cost less than any competitor's.
   Arco Chairman Lodwrick M. Cook said Thursday the fuel will help
prove his contention that cleaner gasolines, not fuels such as
methanol or natural gas, are the best way to meet increasingly
tough smog-control laws. The gasoline will cost a few cents more
per gallon, but Arco plans to absorb the costs rather than passing
them on to dealers, Cook said.

   As the Soviet economy tries to switch from
state-run to market-driven, the New York Stock Exchange is offering
help in reviving an institution that flourished in St. Petersburg
until the 1917 revolution.
   A trip to Moscow next month by NYSE Chairman John J. Phelan Jr.
and other Wall Street leaders could help reshape the Soviet
economy, but U.S. experts say it will be years before profit-taking
and program trading become Soviet lingo.
   Before creating a place to swap stocks and bonds, the rigid
central economy must be dismantled, economists said. State-owned
firms must be turned into private companies and a banking system
installed.
   The Soviets also must decide why they want a stock exchange: For
worker ownership of newly privatized enterprises? To raise capital
for moribund factories? For trading, speculation and profit-making?
   No matter what, it would be a long way from Lenin, who after the
October revolution denounced the ``grasping, malicious, frenzied,
filthy avidity of the moneybags'' inhabiting banks and exchanges.
   ``The minute you allow the stock of Soviet companies to be sold
you have affected the way in which income will be distributed
throughout society,'' said Paul Gregory, a Soviet expert at the
University of Houston. ``You're dipping into very fundamental
issues.''
   As in other Eastern European countries, Soviet officials are
pressing ahead. Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris
Yeltsin, president of the Russian republic, recently agreed on a
plan for free markets within 500 days. Laws expanding private
ownership rights and creating a banking system and stock market
would be readied in the first 100 days.
   At Soviet invitation, the NYSE, the largest U.S. stock exchange,
is holding a seminar in Moscow Oct. 8-10 on creating a Soviet
exchange. Sessions will touch on operations, regulation and other
issues.
   ``What we're going over to do is answer questions they have and
share the experiences we've had the last 200 years in the evolution
of our exchange,'' NYSE spokesman Richard Torrenzano said.
   The Soviets have history of their own on which to draw.
   A ``fondovaia birzha'' thrived in St. Petersburg, now Leningrad,
from the early 1800s until Lenin seized all private assets in
December 1917. The stock exchange building on Vasilii Island in the
Neva River, now a naval museum, could be returned to its former use.
   Trading there occurred in many of the more than 2,000 Russian
companies existing in 1914, as well as government and corporate
bonds and foreign stocks. Russia was the world's largest debtor at
the time, and bonds of its companies traded actively in Paris.
   Commodity exchanges abounded, with 82 in 1914, according to
Thomas C. Owen, a Louisiana State University historian writing a
book about companies in czarist Russia. The first was formed in St.
Petersburg in 1703. Odessa had a grain exchange, Kiev a sugar
exchange and Kharkov an iron and coal exchange.
   Economic need forced a brief and tightly controlled revival of
commodity houses and companies in the 1920s before a total
abolition by Stalin in 1928. The gap has made returning to a market
system more difficult, scholars said.
   ``There is no culture of capitalism from which this generation
can draw,'' Owen said Thursday. ``There is no cultural background
for these European and American institutions.''
   Hungary has the only functioning stock exchange in Eastern
Europe, but activity there is slight. Poland has approved
legislation creating an exchange and Czechoslovakia has said one
will follow many other reforms.
   David Kemme, an economist at the Institute for East-West
Security Study in New York, said a stock exchange ``is not the most
important component. It's not even the most important part of
capital markets.''
   Before state-owned enterprises issue stock, their assets have to
be fairly valued, presumably by commercial banks that could approve
loans.
   Czechoslovak and Polish reform plans, possible models for the
Soviet Union, called first for prices to be liberalized, allowing
fluctuations and, therefore, markets for goods and services.
   State-owned enterprises then could be converted into joint-stock
companies. The state could own 51 percent of shares, with the rest
distributed to workers, the population at large or foreign
investors.
   The ruble would have to be made convertible to attract
foreigners, experts said, allowing its rate to fluctuate in
relation to foreign currencies.
   Once commercial banks are able to assess companies'
creditworthiness, the value of physical and intangible assets can
be established and shares issued.
   ``For an investor, it's going to be very tricky,'' Kemme said.
``No one's going to have any clue what they're buying.''
   There are other questions, such as whether the new economy would
produce the kind of power elite the revolution sought to crush.
   ``They have to permit the possibility that some individuals will
accumulate vast capital holdings in the means of production that
were formerly owned by the government,'' said Judy Shelton, a
research fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution and
author of ``The Coming Soviet Crash.''
   Tomasz Telma, an economist with PlanEcon Research Associates
Inc. in Washington, said the sale of shares outside a company could
be limited initially to stop foreigners or domestic parties from
gaining too much control.
   ``The bottom line is to allow workers to purchase stocks in the
company they work for but not sell too many to prevent effective
management,'' Telma said.
   Shelton said Soviet leaders and citizens also must overcome the
communist belief that a society of capitalists and workers is ``a
recipe for exploitation.''
   ``In the back of their minds I think the Russians will be
receptive to the idea once they get over the stigma that this is
capitalist,'' she said, adding that stocks may prove appealing
because ``the people own the means of production.''

<HEAD>Ho-Hum August for Retailers Prompts Predictions of Worse to Come</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Retail Sales-Table</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The specter of a sluggish Christmas season has retailers
thinking conservatively and shoppers may find abundant holiday
bargains as stores try to boost business during the industry's most
important time of year.
   Major retailers on Thursday posted generally mediocre to poor
August results.
   Analysts said retail sales could go into an extended slump for
the rest of the year because concerns about U.S. involvement in the
Middle East have made consumers, who already had economic worries,
even more nervous about spending.
   ``I think that the retail environment faces a challenging
Christmas season,'' predicted Jeffrey P. Luker of the Andersen
Consulting division of Arthur Andersen &amp; Co.
   Several national chains did adequately during the start of the
traditional back-to-school period but overall the retail industry
rang up sluggish revenue.
   ``I would say that the list of retailers reporting disappointing
sales is growing,'' said analyst Jeffrey Edelman of Barclays de
Zoete Wedd. ``We are in a consumer slowdown. And before it's over
we're going to have more disappointments and that list is going to
grow.''
   He added: ``The bottom line is we are heading into a recession
if we're not there already.''
   Mindful of the economy's weakness and the negative impact that
the Persian Gulf conflict has had on consumer confidence, retailers
are planning to keep inventories as trim as possible in the months
ahead. Most are cautious about how business will be during the
Christmas season _ when they typically look to make 50 percent to
60 percent of their annual profits.
   ``Retailers are already cutting back on merchandise commitments
as well as reducing expenses in order to protect profitability,''
said analyst Jeffrey Feiner of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. ``This will be
another difficult Christmas for most retailers, marking the first
time in awhile that we've had two poor Christmases back to back.''
   The grim outlook for retailers could be good for customers.
Shoppers may find merchandise marked down earlier than normal. A
season of brisk promotional activity is expected as retailers pour
on the hype to boost sales.
   But with inventories being kept lean, retailers may not need to
be quite as aggressive in moving merchandise as they were last
year, when financial problems at some chains triggered rampant
price cutting.
   In any event, Feiner said Merrill Lynch has reduced its earnings
projections for retailers and now expects average growth this year
of 5 percent to 7 percent rather than 6 percent to 8 percent
forecast previously.
   A few retailers bucked the trend in August. One of the
exceptions was Wal-Mart Stores Inc., a rapidly expanding discounter
widely believed to be on the brink of unseating the industry's two
highest ranking retailers in size, Sears, Roebuck and Co. and K
mart Corp.
   Wal-Mart posted a double digit gain in sales of stores open a
year or longer, as it usually does each month. Called comparable or
same-store sales, these results are considered the best guide to a
retailer's health. They exclude the revenue that comes from opening
new outlets.
   Total August sales for Wal-Mart jumped 30 percent from a year
earlier while sales at stores operating at least a year were up 13
percent.
   Sears, the industry leader in terms of annual sales volume last
year, experienced a modest improvement in August from recent past
months but sales still were only so-so. Total sales rose 4.7
percent from August of last year while same-store sales were up 4.1
percent.
   Discounter K mart Corp., the second largest U.S. retailer, said
parents shopping for clothing and merchandise for the new school
year helped offset softness in electronics and other categories of
expensive goods.
   On a comparable store basis, K mart's sales edged up 1.6
percent. Total K mart sales, including stores opened in the past
year, grew 11.1 percent.
   Sales this year looked particularly poor for some retailers
because they were compared to robust levels in August 1989.
   J.C. Penney Co., for instance, said its store and catalog sales
for the four weeks ended Sept. 1 slid 1.2 percent from a record
amount in the corresponding 1989 period. Sales at stores open a
year or longer slumped 2.4 percent.
   Penney Chairman William R. Howell said the retailer was up
against a strong 1989 performance when Penney led all department
store chains with a 14.4 percent increase in same-store sales, the
largest monthly gain for all of 1989.
   There was evidence in the numbers Thursday that new fall
fashions haven't captivated shoppers. A leading specialty apparel
chain, Limited Inc., often regarded as a barometer of the response
to styles in women's clothing, said its same-store sales inched up
just 1 percent. Total August sales at Limited rose 14 percent.
   By contrast, specialty apparel chain Gap Inc. had brisk August
business. Total sales grew 24 percent while comparable-store sales
gained 14 percent.

<TEXT>
   Prodigy, the home computer information service
owned by IBM and Sears, says it hopes to gain a million subscribers
by the end of 1991 and start turning a profit in a few years.
   But some industry analysts are skeptical. Similar computer-based
home shopping and information services with nearly as powerful
backers failed to catch on and were closed in recent years.
   On Thursday, Prodigy announced it was available nationwide
except Alaska. The service says it already has about 465,000
members in 42 major cities, and now will be available in most areas.
   Prodigy is losing money, but it should turn a profit in ``the
early 1990s,'' said its president, Theodore Papes. He declined to
discuss specific financial figures.
   Analysts estimate the 50-50 investment in Prodigy by
International Business Machines Corp. and Sears, Roebuck and Co. at
$500 million to $800 million.
   Among Prodigy's 900 services are news, sports scores, weather
reports, children's stories and other features, as well as
commercial services such as discount stock trading, airline ticket
purchasing and home shopping through Sears, J.C. Penney Co. and
other retailers.
   Prodigy also offers a messaging service between members, and on
Thursday added several new services, including an encyclopedia.
   Nearly every Prodigy ``page'' has an ad at the bottom, making it
the only advertiser-supported computer service. Papes said ad
revenue helps limit subscription costs and eliminates the need for
the per-minute charges levied by some competitors.
   Prodigy costs $9.95 a month on an annual subscription basis and
$12.95 on a month-to-month basis.
   Subscribers also need Prodigy software, at $49.95; the right
kind of computer, such as an Apple Macintosh or IBM or compatible
models; and a modem, the device that connects a computer to the
telephone. Prodigy sells a modem and software package for $179.95.
   Prodigy says it has about 200 advertisers, including the
retailers and banking services available on the system.
   Prodigy was launched two years ago. By that time, CBS Inc., one
of the original partners, had pulled out. Since then, it says it
has been the fastest-growing computer information service.
   Prodigy's chief competitors are CompuServe Information Services,
which is owned by H&amp;R Block Inc., General Electric Co.'s GEnie, and
Quantum Computer Services, said Joshua Harris, president of Jupiter
Communications Co., a New York research firm that follows the
database industry.
   Harris said both CompuServe and GEnie are highly profitable, in
part because they have invested much less and have fewer employees
than Prodigy, which employs about 1,300 workers.
   CompuServe, the largest computer service at over 600,000
members, is aimed more at computer buffs than Prodigy, Harris said.
That could work in Prodigy's favor since it is attracting more
female users that CompuServe, and women do more shopping than men,
he added.
   Harris said it would be difficult for IBM and Sears to win back
their investment.
   As to Prodigy's growth prospects, he said, ``There's a finite
pool of people with PCs and modems.''
   He also said that with current personal computer technology, it
takes more time to get at certain data in Prodigy, such as weather
reports, than it would to turn on the TV to an all-weather cable
channel.
   Prodigy executives say one of the biggest hurdles they face is
getting customers to try the service. There is a lack of knowledge
of what it provides among the 20 million U.S. homes with computers.
   IBM is helping boost Prodigy awareness by packaging it with its
new home computer line, the PS-1, which it launched in June.
   Similar so-called videotex services offered by two newspaper
companies, Knight-Ridder Inc. and Times Mirror Co., were closed in
the past few years after their parent companies grew discouraged
with their prospects.
   While Prodigy is an information service, its success may lie in
its value to advertisers, analysts say.
   ``Prodigy is an extremely powerful marketing tool,'' says a
report from Yankee Group, a Boston-based research firm, because it
allows advertisers to know exactly how many people are reading
their ads and, in many cases, provides demographic information on
the viewers.

<HEAD>OTS Expands Charges Against Spiegel, Opens Hearings to Public</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Regulators have expanded their charges against
Thomas Spiegel, a former thrift executive who had ``survival
chamber'' bathrooms with bullet-proof glass installed in the
company's new headquarters.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision announced Thursday that it
added a new charge to its accusations against Spiegel, who had
earlier been accused of squandering $19 million.
   The thrift agency's latest accusation says Spiegel caused a
$29.2 million loss to Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association from the
construction of a new headquarters ``without any attempt to limit
costs.'' The new building included a large multi-level gymnasium
and the ``survival chamber'' bathrooms that also had an independent
air and food supply, the OTS said.
   Columbia, which is trying to sell the building, has removed the
gymnasium and the survival chambers. The building cost Columbia
more than $54.7 and has a market value of around $24 million,
according to the OTS.
   It was not possible to remove the top-quality limestone and
marble, stainless steel floors and ceiling tiles, leather wall
coverings and other accoutrements ordered by Spiegel, according to
the regulators' latest catalog of S&amp;L excesses.
   In a related development, the OTS said it has decided to open to
the public hearings on the charges against Spiegel and Charles H.
Keating Jr., a key figure in the savings and loan crisis. Nearly
all the documents related to those two proceedings also will be
made public, the agency said.
   ``The American taxpayer will be best served by open hearings in
these cases,'' OTS Director Timothy Ryan said in a statement.
``With accurate reporting by the news media, Americans will have
the opportunity to understand the importance of both of these
enforcement actions by the agency.''
   Spiegel was the chief executive officer of Columbia, a troubled
thrift based in Beverly Hills, Calif. In late July, Columbia agreed
to sell its high-risk junk bonds for $3 billion to a Canadian-led
investment group. Regulators had allowed Columbia to continue
operating even though it was insolvent while its managers tried to
find a buyer for the bonds.
   The new charge has been added to the regulators' previous
allegations that Spiegel breached his duty to Columbia's
shareholders and showed a ``reckless disregard'' for the law that
resulted in excessive personal enrichment.
   The OTS alleges that Spiegel used Columbia's funds to pay for
trips he took with members of his family to, among other places,
London; Rome, Milan and Bologna, Italy; Frankfurt and Munich, West
Germany; and Zurich, Switzerland. On four trips alone, Spiegel
charged to the thrift around $70,000 in hotel bills and other
expenses that were unrelated to business, according to an OTS
document.
   Spiegel also spent at least $91,000 of Columbia's money to buy
about 80 guns, including Uzi submachine guns, rifles, revolvers,
automatic pistols and shotguns, as well as ammunition and
accessories.
   The OTS has been seeking to bar Spiegel from the financial
institutions industry, and to recover $19 million from him for
restitution and a civil penalty of $5 million. The $19 million in
restitution would go to Columbia, while the $5 million penalty
would be paid to the Treasury.
   The total of $24 million represents the largest civil case ever
brought against an individual by thrift regulators.
   The regulators accused Spiegel in July of squandering $19
million on various ventures, some in partnership with his friend
and financial ally, junk bond pioneer Michael Milken. Spiegel
angrily denied the charges, which the OTS made in a civil lawsuit.
   Under Spiegel's direction, Columbia had the thrift industry's
largest portfolio of junk bonds.
   On Wednesday, the Justice Department announced that Keating had
agreed to give notice of any large transactions and not to transfer
assets out of the country. Those terms had previously been imposed
on Keating by the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles.
   Keating recently provided financial disclosure statements to the
regulators, but they will not be made public as part of the move
announced Thursday, an OTS spokesman said.
   The government's case against Keating stems from the collapse of
Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif., which
Keating controlled and has been accused of looting. Regulators
estimate the failure may cost taxpayers $2 billion, ranking with
Miami's CenTrust Bank as the costliest S&amp;L failures.
   The OTS has partially frozen Keating's assets in connection with
its efforts to recover $41 million from him and five associates.
   Keating denies any wrongdoing. His case has attracted particular
attention because of his $1.3 million in contributions to the
campaigns of five senators: Republican John McCain of Arizona and
Democrats Alan Cranston of California, Donald W. Riegle Jr. of
Michigan, Dennis DeConcini of Arizona and John Glenn of Ohio.

<HEAD>GM-UAW Talks Progressing Well with a Week Left</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National contracts between the United Auto
Workers union and the Big Three automakers expire a week from
today, and talks are going well at the largest of the automakers,
union and company officials say.
   UAW Vice President Stephen Yokich, directing the union's
bargaining team with GM, said Thursday that talks with GM are
progressing faster than past contracts.
   He said negotiators would begin ``burning the midnight oil''
today and that weekend bargaining sessions were likely.
   Late last month, the union chose GM as its bargaining target in
talks with GM, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. UAW contracts with
the three automakers cover more than 450,000 active workers. Each
expires at midnight Sept. 14 _ one week from today.
   If things go as the union plans, a contract ratified by GM
workers will be used as a pattern for agreements with Ford and
Chrysler.
   ``I think we are right down to the hard stuff now,'' Yokich told
reporters Thursday. ``I think we're way ahead of any past
schedules.''
   He said company and union negotiators have reached tentative
agreements on about half of the non-economic issues before them.
Typically, economic issues, including wages, time off and job
security, are left for last.
   GM spokesman John Maciarz declined to estimate how far
bargaining on non-economic issues has progressed other than to say:
``We're still making good progress.
   ``The members of the (GM negotiating) committee like where they
are at this point of negotiations.''
   There has been a calm air surrounding the UAW-GM negotiations
this year. The only evidence of contention has come from bargaining
on contracts at the 155 UAW locals at GM factories.
   Last month, the UAW staged a six-day strike at a parts plant in
Flint that resulted in shutdowns at seven assembly plants and
partial or complete shutdowns at more than a dozen component plants.
   The walkout was settled when union members ratified a contract
guaranteeing more than 2,500 jobs for six years.

<TEXT>
   Two defunct penny stock brokerages and 15
individuals in four states have been charged by federal regulators
with a series of schemes that netted $20.7 million from investors
in high risk securities.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission brought charges Thursday
against Power Securities Corp., a Las Vegas-based brokerage that
went out of business in February 1989, and seven of its officers
and employees.
   The SEC civil action, filed at federal court in Denver, also
charged Allied Capital Group Inc., an Englewood, Colo. firm that
ceased operations in November 1989, and six officers and employees.
   The SEC charged that the two firms had a secret working
relationship in violation of federal securities law.
   Meanwhile, two other former Power employees have settled civil
charges with the SEC _ one of them agreeing to a 15-month
suspension from the securities industry.
   Penny stocks are low-cost, high-risk securities that are usually
not traded on any stock exchange. Information about their price and
performance is often sketchy and difficult to come by, making them
ripe for fraud schemes.
   State securities regulators have estimated that American
investors lose up to $1 billion a year on penny stock fraud.
   The SEC charged that between late 1987 and the fall of 1988,
various defendants excessively marked-up the price of stocks sold
through dealers, engaged in insider trading, manipulated the market
for securities of New York-based Star Publications Inc. and
Denver-based Art Cards Inc.
   Not all of the individual defendants were charged in each
alleged scam.
   The SEC lawsuit seeks a total of $1 million in restitution and
$3 million in fines from Power, Allied and three individuals:
Power's board chairman, Richard T. Marchese, 30, of Las Vegas;
Allied's former president, Barry H. Freedman, 38, Parker, Colo.;
and Joseph V. Pignatiello, 43, Englewood, Colo., the head of a
financial consulting company.
   The SEC lawsuit also seeks a court order requiring all
defendants to pay back all illegal profits and losses avoided
through their alleged illegal activities.
   The SEC announced that Toni S. Allen, 40, of Las Vegas, a former
Power account executive and Joseph M. McDonough, of Denver, the
firm's former vice president of finance and compliance, settled
civil charges without admitting or denying wrongdoing.
   McDonough agreed to be barred from the industry for at least 18
months.

<TEXT>
   U.S. securities regulators have charged a
former director of ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd. with making $2.6
million in illegal trading profits on inside information about the
Swedish-Swiss company's acquisition of Combustion Engineering.
   Christian Norgren was accused in a civil complaint Thursday of
illegal insider trading in Combustion Engineering securities
through his company, Finacor Anstalt, a Liechtenstein-based
financial services company.
   Norgren, a Swedish citizen living in Liechtenstein, allegedly
used confidential information about the then-upcoming $1.6 billion
deal to buy Combustion Engineering common stock and call options
contracts.
   A call option contract is an agreement to buy 100 shares of a
stock at a later datt price. It is a trading strategy used by
investors betting a stock's price will rise sharply.
   The Nov. 13, 1989 announcement of ABB's takeover offer for
Combustion Engineering at $40 per share drove the Stamford,
Conn.-based company's stock up more than $13 per share.
   Thursday's charges were the latest in a Securities and Exchange
Commission crackdown on alleged insider trading by foreign
companies and individuals.
   Thursday's complaint, filed by the Securities and Exchange
Commission at federal court in New York, amended earlier charges
brought late last year against Finacor Anstalt.
   Last December, a federal judge froze about $3 million of Finacor
Anstalt's U.S. assets.
   A New York attorney representing Finacor Anstalt called the
amended complaint ``an unwarranted effort to expand the charges in
this case.''
   ``This case should have been settled long ago and could have
been, had not the commission adopted a rigid agenda unrelated to
the merits of this action,'' said Finacor attorney Thomas E. Engel,
adding that Finacor has tried to resolve the matter without loss to
Combustion Engineering share and options holders.
   In addition to Norgren and Finacor Anstalt, the SEC action also
charges unidentified persons or entities who bought Combustion
Engineering call options contracts through an account in the Grand
Cayman Islands of the Caribbean and an account with an unidentified
Luxembourg bank.
   In a related case, a Rancho Mirage, Calif. agri-businessman
settled SEC charges that he aided Norgren's alleged illegal trading.
   Howard P. Marguleas, head of a private agricultural concern,
settled _ without admitting or denying wrongdoing _ a separate
civil complaint that he bought 200 call option contracts for Norgen
in November 1989.
   The SEC said Marguleas tried to reverse the transaction and
refused to pay for the securities after the tender offer was
publicly announced.
   The $229,000 in trading profits reverted to a brokerage error
account and as part of the settlement, Marguleas asked that the
firm release the funds to the court, said his attorney, Alexia
Morrison.
   ``There was never any intent that Howard going to benefit from
this. It was a trade made as a favor to Christian (Norgren),'' she
said, adding ``Howard was a victim here.''

<HEAD>Financial Company Chairman Fellheimer Quitting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman and chief executive of Equimark
Corp., Alan S. Fellheimer, is resigning from those posts.
   The troubled bank holding company announced Thursday that
Fellheimer, 47, will return the practice of law. He will continue
to serve as a director after his resignation becomes effective.
   ``I am leaving because Equimark now needs steady, day-to-day
management and I find more personal satisfaction in crisis and
turnaround management and the problem solving associated with the
practice of law,'' Fellheimer said in the statement.
   The announcement follows the May 29 resignation of Fellheimer's
wife, Judith, as Equimark vice chairman. Shortly after that move,
Claire Gargalli resigned as company president.
   Equimark has reported losses of $31 million in the first half of
this year, and the company announced Tuesday it was suspending
dividend payments on its common stock.
   But a company official said Thursday that Fellheimer's
resignation was not connected to the company's financial situation.
   ``It was very much a personal choice on Alan's part,'' said
Libby Fishman, Equimark's executive vice president and general
counsel. ``He will remain available during an orderly transition
period.''
   Fellheimer was named to lead Equimark in 1985 after joining the
$3.5 billion company as a director the previous year. At the time,
federal regulators were threatening to shut down the bank.
   ``Equimark now has in place marketing, operating, credit quality
and expense-containment plans necessary, which will serve as the
basis for the company's new strategy, and return to
profitability,'' Fellheimer said.
   Part of the bank's recovery is due to a personal investment by
Fellheimer and his wife of $9.5 million in Equimark. The purchase
gave the Fellheimers a 10 percent stake in the company.
   Equimark said Fellheimer has no plans to make a ``significant
change in his equity position'' in the company.
   The Equimark board of directors has established a committee to
find a successor for Fellheimer. David Gardner, a director, will
chair the committee.
   Equimark's principal subsidiaries include Equibank, Liberty
Financial Group Inc., EquiManagement Inc. and Treasure Valley
Bancorp Inc.

<HEAD>Government Regains Control of Franklin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OVERLAND PARK, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government again has
control of Franklin Savings Association.
   Just six hours after the thrift's managers moved back into their
offices Thursday, a federal appeals court temporarily set aside a
court order issued Wednesday that had returned Franklin to its
owners.
   U.S. District Judge Dale E. Saffels had ruled Wednesday that
regulators improperly seized the thrift, the largest in Kansas.
   The appeals court's stay does not overturn Saffels' order, but
sets it aside for an undetermined length of time.
   In response to the order issued by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in Denver, Saffels ordered the Office of Thrift
Supervision to reinstate the Resolution Trust Corp. as conservator
in charge of Franklin. The court made no comment on Saffels'
decision.
   ``The reaction is this is an order of the court and obviously
we'll comply,'' said Roger Stanton, an attorney for Franklin.
``Ernie (Franklin Chairman Ernest Fleischer) had a nice day seeing
employees and customers. They were all happy to see him back.''
   The OTS seized control of Franklin, based in Ottawa, Kan., last
February in a dispute over whether it was being managed prudently.
It placed Franklin under management of the RTC, the agency formed
to sell or liquidate insolvent thrifts.
   Franklin's officers sued to regain control of the thrift, and
Saffels held in a 93-page opinion made public Wednesday that the
government seizure was arbitrary and capricious and had no basis in
law.
   OTS attorney Harris Weinstein in Washington reiterated Wednesday
after the ruling that the federal agency believes Franklin had
insufficient capital and was being operated unsafely before it was
seized.
   Fleischer was talking to an employee in the thrift's Overland
Park office when he received word of the stay on Thursday. He said
it was not a setback.
   ``The important steps are the district court decision and the
appellate court decision,'' he said. ``You might want to think of
this in terms of the reverse. Let's suppose the OTS had won this
case. I would much rather have a district court victory and allow
the appellate court whatever time it needs.''
   But he said he thought the sudden shift in control hurt several
groups.
   ``We do not believe that the change of control from the
government to the management and back again to the government is
good for the employees, the public or for anyone,'' Fleischer said.
   Steven Dimmick, an OTS attorney, said the stay did not mean the
fight between Franklin and the government agency was over.
   The government filed a notice of appeal with the appeals court
Thursday but has not yet presented its case to overturn Saffels'
decision.
   Stanton said he anticipated it would take the court a week to
two weeks to review the case.
   An OTS statement said its director, T. Timothy Ryan, reinstated
the RTC as a conservator to retake control of Franklin on Thursday
night.
   Fleischer and other board members had met with officials from
the RTC Thursday morning, the deadline Saffels had given regulators
to return the thrift.
   ``We waited for a couple minutes and then the order came in from
Timothy Ryan to return the thrift to us, and that's what they
did,'' said John Scowcroft, president of Franklin's holding company.
   Government attorneys filed a motion with the appeals panel
shortly after the deadline asking for a stay. Earlier Thursday
morning, Saffels had denied a similar request for a stay.

   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis arrived in Germany today
on a trade mission, leaving Massachusetts to an insurgent
lieutenant governor who threatened to seize control of the state's
ailing finances while he's gone.
   Dukakis allies doubted that Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy, lagging in
the Democratic primary to succeed her boss, can do anything in her
week as acting governor to solve a fiscal crisis more than 2 years
old.
   ``She's elevated Murphy's Law to an art form,'' said Stephen
Crawford, a Dukakis spokesman. ``Whatever can go wrong, she'll make
sure goes wrong.''
   Murphy said Dukakis and his aides are overreacting.
   ``I don't understand what he's afraid of,'' she said Thursday.
   Dukakis delayed his trip after Murphy said she intended to take
over state government and push secret financial plans once he left.
He eventually decided to go. He arrived in Berlin this morning, his
office said.
   ``I think the episode of the past 24 hours is really kind of
pathetic,'' Dukakis told reporters before boarding his plane.
   Dukakis is scheduled to return Sept. 14, four days before the
primary election. He said he could cut short his trip if anything
happened that affected the government's stability.
   In Massachusetts, the lieutenant governor is elected
independently of the governor. Murphy was a strong supporter of
Dukakis in his 1988 bid for the presidency but has been at odds
with him before.
   ``There's no good will here and certainly no mutual respect,''
Murphy said.
   She said she was treated with disrespect Wednesday in telephone
conversations with Dukakis and his chief of staff, S. Stephen
Rosenfeld, who demanded that she disclose her plans. She said she
would disclose the plans today.
   ``To see the kind of overreaction by him and by his staff, this
kind of wildness, I don't understand,'' Murphy said.
   Dukakis bitterly denounced Murphy, saying she was using a
political maneuver designed to gain favor with voters in her
gubernatorial bid.
   Murphy is well behind her two opponents in the Sept. 18
Democratic primary, according to recent polls. Before this week,
she tried gently to dissociate herself from Dukakis, claiming she
warned him in writing in the spring of 1988 that the state was
headed for trouble.
   The state had one of the nation's strongest economies during
much of the 1980s, a fact Dukakis touted in his presidential bid.
But by the time he returned after losing to George Bush, the
economy had begun slipping.
   Now the state has the lowest bond ratings in the country. And
just today, the federal Labor Department announced that the state's
unemployment rate in August soared to 6.7 percent, up from only 4.1
percent a year ago. The national rate stands at 5.6 percent.
   The Legislature has approved three tax increases, including one
this year that is the largest in state history.
   Lawmakers this year also ordered $265 million cut from the
state's $13.4 billion budget; Dukakis, learning that tax revenues
were below expectations, on Tuesday ordered his Cabinet to make an
additional $150 million in cuts.
   Murphy insisted quicker action was needed, but she didn't
immediately give specifics.
   Murphy's actions caused a defection within her ranks. William
Currier, a campaign coordinator, resigned this week because of her
moves against Dukakis.
   Currier dismissed Murphy's maneuver as ``show bizzy.''
   ``It's almost an attempted bloodless coup,'' he said.

   Stock prices drifted lower today, registering
some disappointment over the latest news on employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 8.91 to 2,587.38
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 8 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 311 up, 486 down and
482 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 15.45 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said the Labor Department's report for August on the
employment situation suggested continuing weakness in the economy _
but not enough evidence of trouble to warrant action by the Federal
Reserve to relax its credit policy.
   Thus, the data seemed to provide little encouragement for
traders on the outlook for either interest rates or corporate
profits.
   The civilian unemployment rate increased from 5.5 percent in
July to 5.6 percent last month. Nonfarm payroll employment dropped
by 75,000 jobs, after a revised decline of 89,000 in July.
   Interest rates rose in the government bond market after the
report was issued.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Boeing slipped | to 46|;
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph \ to 31\, and Eastman Kodak &lsqb; to 40|.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.29 to 175.72. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 1.00 at 323.50.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 31.93 to
2,596.29.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 9 to 5 on the
NYSE, with 507 up, 951 down and 489 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 125.62 million shares, against 120.61
million in the previous session.

<HEAD>Former Director of Wall Street Brokerage Firm Indicted</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former director of a defunct Wall Street
brokerage firm has been accused of obstructing an insider trading
inquiry and lying to Securities and Exchange Commission
investigators.
   A federal grand jury returned a three-count indictment Thursday
against Charles Howard, 45, of Bedford, N.H., former director and
first vice president of Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc., U.S.
Attorney Wayne Budd said.
   The indictment charged Howard with conspiracy to obstruct an SEC
investigation, obstructing an SEC investigation and perjury in the
SEC's 1987 inquiry of alleged insider trading.
   The 1987 SEC investigation followed the announcement that
Suffield Savings Bank of Suffield, Conn., and Coastal Savings Bank
of Portland, Maine, planned to merge.
   Howard was a key figure in a four-state investigation of the New
York-based Thomson McKinnon that led last March to $320,000
penalties against the brokerage firm to be paid to Connecticut, New
Hampshire, Vermont and Maine.
   Howard was accused of conspiring with others to conceal from the
SEC the names of investors with inside information who had bought
Coastal stock before the July 9, 1986 announcement of the merger
plans.
   The indictment also alleged that Howard tried to influence,
obstruct and impede the SEC's investigation of the trading of
Coastal stock and that he committed perjury before the SEC.
   If convicted of all the charges, Howard faces a maximum 15 years
in prison and a $750,000 fine, Budd said. He said arraignment had
not been scheduled.
   Howard's attorney, Steven M. Gordon of Concord, said Thursday
that Howard has known for several years that federal investigators
were probing his dealings. ``He is in some respects relieved that
he will now be provided with the specifics of the allegations
against him and be permitted to fully contest the charges in a
court of law,'' Gordon said in a statement.
   Howard will not comment on the case until he sees the evidence
against him, Gordon said.
   Investigations into suspicious trading of stock in at least 10
New England banks revolved around Howard, who had close ties to the
Suffield Bank and a former executive, Robert DiGennaro.
   DiGennaro, former chief executive of the Suffield Financial
Corp., was convicted on insider trading and obstruction charges
last year. Investigators traced a lead of privileged information
from DiGennaro through a Simsbury developer to a Hartford
stockbroker.
   Days before its chairman was indicted, Suffield filed a $24
million lawsuit against Howard for the losses the company sustained
buying back stock under the broker's direction.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Olsten Corp. plans to buy a health services
subsidiary from Upjohn Co. for an undisclosed amount, the two
companies announced Friday.
   The purchase of Upjohn HealthCare Services Inc., which had about
$182 million in sales last year and accounted for 6 percent of
Upjohn's total sales, will expand Olsten's presence in the home
health care field.
   Upjohn HealthCare provides home health care and supplemental
staffing to hospitals, nursing homes and in other settings. The
sale, which must receive regulatory clearance and legal approval,
includes operations in both the United States and Canada.
   Olsten's health care network will grow by more than 200 offices,
giving it the capability to supply trained temporary help to
patients in homes and elsewhere in more parts of North America.
   ``Acquiring the Upjohn HealthCare Services network is part of
Olsten's strategic plan and will save us years of internal growth
and development in health care services,'' said Frank N. Liguori,
vice chairman and chief executive officer of Olsten Corp.
   Olsten, based in Westbury, N.Y., is the third largest temporary
help provider. Last year it employed 325,000 temporary workers in
business, industry, government and health care throughout a network
of 550 owned, franchised and licensed offices.
   By divesting the unit, Upjohn will shed a subsidiary that no
longer fits into its corporate fold.
   ``As we position the company for the decade of the nineties we
realize that Upjohn HealthCare Services does not provide an
acceptable fit to our strategic plan,'' said Upjohn's Chairman,
President and Chief Executive Officer Theodore Cooper.
   Upjohn, based in Kalamazoo, Mich., is a major worldwide provider
of human health care products, animal health products, specialty
chemicals and some agricultural items.
   The joint announcement of the sale was made available here.

<HEAD>Bush Says He's Committed to $50 Billion Deficit Reduction</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New material, editing throughout with Bush remarks. Also
moving on general news wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush arrived at
budget negotiations with congressional leaders today saying he is
committed to working out a $50 billion deficit-reduction program
for next year.
   ``Nothing has transpired anywhere that makes me less interested
in getting this budget deficit under control once and for all,''
Bush said as he arrived at Andrews Air Force Base outside
Washington, the site of the talks.
   Some lawmakers have said that with the weakening economy and the
uncertain situation in the Persian Gulf, a smaller
deficit-reduction plan could avoid pushing the economy into a
recession.
   Asked if the figure of $50 billion in savings is carved in
stone, the president responded, ``Yes.''
   Bush said he was ``somewhat optimistic'' that a budget deal
could be worked out quickly. ``I am pleased with ... the
cooperative attitude that exists up there now (on Capitol Hill),''
Bush told reporters on leaving the White House. ``I am hopeful that
this spirit of cooperation ... will be the catalyst in getting the
budget agreement that's long overdue.''
   Bush remained at the negotiations for about a half-hour. The
budget negotiators, ending a five-week break for Congress' August
recess, hoped to work out a deal by Monday.
   But the president acknowledged that Democrats and Republicans
have a large gap to bridge before finalizing a compromise.
   ``Big differences remain,'' he said. ``It's going to take
compromise.''
   Congressional negotiators said foreign payments for American
military forces in the Persian Gulf would help their efforts to
reduce the deficit.
   ``I think the fact that some allies are being helpful will help
us,'' Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., said as bargainers gathered at
Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland outside Washington.
   ``Obviously we have to take into account the cost of the Desert
Shield operation,'' said House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt,
D-Mo., referring to the U.S. operations in the Middle East. ``To
the extent those costs can be offset by our allies around the world
that makes our job easier.''
   Officials announced that Saudi Arabia, the ousted Kuwaiti
government, Japan and South Korea have pledged to help the United
States bear the cost of the economic and military campaign against
Iraq.
   ``We'll put a plan on the table,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici,
R-N.M. ``From what I understand the Democrats will put their plan
on some time this morning, and then we'll start negotiating.''
   Democratic and Republican negotiators said they agree on the
amount of deficit reductions they need, but disagree strongly over
how far to cut military spending.
   The new fiscal year begins Oct. 1. Without some combination of
spending cuts and tax increases, the administration estimates the
budget gap will approach a record $250 billion, Republican
officials said.
   Unless a budget deal is enacted by then, the Gramm-Rudman law
will impose about $100 billion in spending cuts in most domestic
and defense programs. As a result, the bargainers hope to wrap up a
deal by Monday to give Congress time to enact it.
   Leaders of both sides said they want to aim for packages cutting
red ink by $50 billion next year and $500 billion over five years.
Since Iraq's Aug. 2 conquest of Kuwait and the resulting oil price
increases, some lawmakers have cautioned that the first-year figure
should be lower for fear of driving the weakening economy into a
recession.
   GOP officials, speaking on condition they not be identified,
said their first offer would be similar to the $53 billion
deficit-cutting measure the administration drew up in July.
   It would include new taxes on alcoholic products and defense
cuts of about $7 billion _ several billion dollars less than
Democrats prefer.
   ``I suspect the defense figure will fare better than it
otherwise would have had there not been a crisis in the Middle
East,'' said House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill.
   Democrats talked of a package that would take a deeper slice out
of the Pentagon, more akin to their earlier proposals of $9 billion
to $16 billion cuts. They said they were reluctant to add the costs
of the U.S. Middle East military buildup _ about $1 billion monthly
_ into the long-range spending plan.
   ``It comes more under the head of emergency conditions than of
regular planning for the future,'' said House Speaker Thomas Foley,
D-Wash.
   Foley, House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., and Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said they wanted a budget
plan that also encouraged economic growth, protected social
programs, contained progressive taxes and pushed the United States
toward energy security.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said he favored energy
production incentives. Domenici, ranking Republican on the Senate
Budget Committee, said new taxes and tax incentives on energy were
a possibility.
   Divisions remained within GOP ranks. Gingrich, the No. 2 House
Republican, continued to call for tax cuts to spur the economy.

   Oil prices dipped this morning but stayed above
$30 per barrel as traders sold futures to pocket their profits from
Thursday's price surge.
   ``I don't really think there's anything in terms of hard news,''
said William Byers, an analyst with Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. ``I think
there's simply some profit taking after the market ran up
yesterday.''
   In late morning trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
light sweet crude was down 70 cents to $30.74 per barrel on October
contracts. On Thursday, oil had shot above $30 per barrel on the
Merc for the second time during the Middle East crisis that began
Aug. 2.
   The Merc had previously not seen $30 oil since November 1985.
   Unleaded gasoline was down .22 cent to 94.85 cents per gallon
this morning for October delivery, while home heating oil was down
1.84 cents to 86.40 cents for October delivery.
   Natural gas was down to $1.501 per 1,000 cubic feet after
closing Thursday at $1.530.
   Other contract months for petroleum futures were also trading
lower today.
   A broker with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. said today's selling
was partially attributable to a report that the Saudis would be
able to vastly increase their crude production by the end of the
year.
   A multinational military force has assembled in Saudi Arabia to
protect it in the wake of Iraq's invasion and occupation of
neighboring Kuwait.
   Anticipation that President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev would issue a joint statement on the Persian Gulf after
their summit Sunday in Helsinki, Finland, also depressed prices,
the Shearson broker said.
   The Soviet Union has been an ally of Iraq, so a joint
U.S.-Soviet statement would show ``it's not the United States
versus Iraq, but it's more the world versus Iraq,'' said the
broker, who did not want his name used.
   The continued airlifting of hostages out of territory controlled
by Iraq was also calming traders this morning, the broker said.

<HEAD>Mack Signs Merger Plan With Renault</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Renault Vehicules Industriels SA has
sweetened its offer and agreed to buy all outstanding shares of
Mack Trucks Inc. that it does not already own in an $81 million
deal, the truck company said.
   Mack said Thursday it had agreed to be sold to the Paris-based
Renault for $6.25 per share. Renault had previously offered $6 a
share.
   Renault owned 44.5 percent of Mack's 29 million shares prior to
the merger agreement. As of late Wednesday, Renault had received an
additional 4.5 percent of Mack's shares under terms of its initial
bid.
   The tender offer has been extended until Sept. 20, said Renault
spokesman Bill Catacosinos Thursday.
   The French car company has been trying to buy the
Allentown-based truck company for several months, saying it was
making the offer ``because of the continuing deterioration of the
financial condition of Mack'' and the need to restructure the
company's debt.
   Mack lost a record $185.4 million last year and $97.2 million
for the six months ending June 30, 1990.
   Net sales for the first half of 1990 were down 22 percent to
$793.9 million from just over $1 billion in 1989.
   The company's five-year financial plan in July projected a net
loss of about $130 million for the year ending Dec. 31, 1990. At
the time, Mack officials said they did not expect the company to
show a profit before 1992.
   In the past year, Mack had tried to reduce business costs and
conserve cash amidst a slowing market for heavy trucks and
negotiated an agreement with the United Auto Workers for employees
at Mack's Winnsboro, S.C., truck plant.
   Mack is one of North America's largest producers of heavy-duty
diesel trucks.

<HEAD>IBM, Metaphor Announce Software Venture</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   IBM Corp. and Metaphor Computer
Systems plan to ease a bottleneck in the computer industry by
developing software that could be used to write other software.
   The new venture, Patriot Partners, will start work immediately
on software that would allow most applications programs to work
with major operating systems, including multiple versions of Unix
and OS@2.
   IBM and Metaphor said Thursday the project probably would take
two or three years. The venture, to be based in Mountain View, will
be jointly staffed and financed and is expected to employ up to 200
people.
   The personal computer-software industry has been hampered by the
cost and difficulty of writing new programs and converting them to
different formats.
   But IBM and Metaphor predicted their new venture will help ease
that problem and make it easier to include such sophisticated
features as stereo sound and full-motion video and let the programs
work together on networks of different kinds of computers.
   ``We think a whole lot of brand-new thinking will come out of
this,'' said Joseph Guglielmi, president of IBM's
applications-solution division.
   Analysts said the effort could have a major impact on the
software industry provided that Patriot Partners can do what it
promises.
   ``There's a lot of questions as to whether they can pull it
off,'' said Nancy McSharry, an analyst with International Data
Corp., a market research company in Mountain View.
   Several years ago, software pioneer Mitch Kapor founded a
company for a similar project, but his firm, On Technology, has
become a developer of applications for the Macintosh computer.
   ``It was Mitch Kapor's initial thought and then he realized how
huge the task was and he came up with much less ambitions plans,''
said Bruce Lupatkin, an analyst with Hambrecht &amp; Quist in San
Francisco. He called the new project ``a bit like searching for the
Holy Grail.''
   But Metaphor's president, David Little, said the new venture
differed from Kapor's plans.
   ``(He) had four guys and a little venture capital,'' Liddle
said. ``We have a battle-hardened organization. We have IBM as a
partner and accept that it's a big activity we're going to have to
do.''
   Metaphor was founded in 1982 by Liddle, chief executive and
president of the new venture, and other former Xerox Corp.
executives who worked with Star computer. That project pioneered
the idea of controlling personal computers with a mouse pointing
device and set of visual prompts, technology that helped popularize
Apple's Macintosh.
   Metaphor originally sold its own computers but now chiefly sells
data-analysis software that incorporates its graphical user
interface. In 1988 IBM paid $10 million for an 8 percent stake in
Metaphor, and the two companies jointly market Metaphor's
data-analysis software.

<HEAD>Reynolds Introduces Cheaper Cigarette</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. is using an
old name to introduce a new low-cost premium cigarette.
   Company spokesmen say they think there's a niche for their
Sterling cigarette, which will sell about $3 a carton below the
price of premium brands and $1 to $2 above savings blends.
   But industry analysts say it's a tricky move for the tobacco
company, which also sells such premium brands as Camel and Winston.
   ``It's a very tricky piece of marketing,'' said David Goldman,
an analyst at Nomura Research Institute in New York. ``If you're so
successful with this brand, ... then you've created a conception in
the consumer's mind that high-quality brands can be had at a lower
price.''
   Despite that risk, Goldman says he thinks the cigarette will be
successful.
   ``It's innovative,'' he said. ``My feeling is it's going to be a
very successful brand. More importantly, it might be the beginning
of a brand-new cigarette segment.''
   Some smokers may remember the old Sterling, a luxury smoke
touted as a cigarette for ``a growing segment of the population who
appreciate the finer things in life,'' as a news release stated.
But similarities end at the name, said Reynolds Tobacco spokeswoman
Peggy C. Carter.
   The tobacco blend and the packaging are different, she said.
   Sterling, to go on sale Oct. 1, will have a metallic-gray
package with burgundy and diagonal stripes _ teal and gold on
menthol packages. Cartons will have coupons that consumers can peel
off at the checkout counter and get $3 off the price.
   ``We do believe Sterling will enhance our portfolio because it's
a whole new dimension in our pricing structure here,'' Ms. Carter
said. ``It is targeted to people who are looking for a
premium-quality cigarette with a price advantage. There is a niche
of people looking for this type of cigarette as a midpoint price.''

<TEXT>
   Bethlehem Steel Corp. said Friday it will
make $100 million in improvements at its Johnstown production plant
if it obtains concessions from the United Steelworkers of America.
   Sufficient concessions would allow the company to make major
improvements, including a new continuous caster and modernization
of an existing bar mill to permit rod production, said Bethlehem
Chairman Walter Williams.
   The Bar, Rod and Wire Division headquarters plant in Johnstown
employs about 2,000 workers, while plants in Lackawanna, N.Y., and
Sparrows Point, Md., each employ 350 workers.
   The current labor contract, which expires July 31, 1993, calls
for modifications to the agreement for plants having financial
difficulties, ``and the Bar, Rod and Wire Division is one of
them,'' said company spokesman Henry Von Spreckelsen.
   He would not indicate what form of concessions the company is
seeking and would only say the division has lost ``millions of
dollars since its formation in 1983.''
   ``It must be competitive on its own terms,'' he said. ``In this
case we're saying for an unprofitable operation to survive requires
a reduction in production costs, through a reduction in labor
costs, and more efficient facilities.
   ``We've made some progress, but it hasn't been sufficient,'' he
said.

magazine's 30 employees Thursday that the September issue will be
the last.
   ``It's been a tough year for everyone in the magazine
business,'' Todd said. ``For us, it proved fatal.''
   Consumer magazine ad pages are down overall this year, and the
tough ad climate has already led to the demise of Woman magazine
and the regional magazines Southpoint and 7 Days.
   Earlier this week, France's Hachette SA said it would end
regular publication of its Memories magazine with the October issue
and publish only two issues of it in 1991 because of the weak ad
climate. The news nostalgia magazine had been published every other
month and had planned to go monthly this fall.
   According MagazineWeek's Ad Monitor, ad revenues for the first
seven months of 1990 at New England Monthly were down 7.5 percent
from 1989.
   From its first issue in April 1984, the magazine attracted a
base of 120,000 subscribers. But it was unable to turn a profit.
   Industry observers said the magazine and the target audience
were not specific enough to draw large amounts of advertising in
several critical categories, such as home furnishings, food and
retailing.
   ``I think what it did best weren't always sexy issues,'' said
Geoffrey Wolff, a Rhode Island-based writer who was a regular
contributor to New England Monthly.
   New England Monthly twice won the National Magazine Award for
general excellence. It won the same award from the American Society
of Magazine Editors.
   New England Monthly was founded by Texas Monthly veteran Robert
Nylen and editor Daniel Okrent. Todd succeeded Okrent as editor
last October.
   The magazine was threatened with closing 18 months ago, but
given a new lease on life when it was bought by Telemedia Inc.,
Canada's largest publisher of consumer magazines.
   The new owner pledged to pour working capital into New England
Monthly. But Todd said the magazine faced an outstanding debt of
about $5 million.

<TEXT>
   The beleagured advertising giant Saatchi &amp; Saatchi
Co. PLC announced Friday it does not have enough reserves at hand
to pay a dividend.
   The shortage follows Saatchi's sale of two consultancy
businesses for less than the expected amount.
   Saatchi is in the process of selling all its consulting
businesses as it tries to focus on its advertising and marketing
businesses. Saatchi grew rapidly in the 1980s and owns the New
York-based ad agencies Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising and Backer
Spielvogel Bates.
   In June, Saatchi sold Peterson &amp; Co., a litigation support
management company, to Peterson's management for about $2.2
million. Saatchi paid $79 million for the unit in September 1987.
   Atchi sold the Hay Co. consultancy to a group of
investors and management for $90 million in cash and notes. It
bought that company in 1985 for an undisclosed sum.
   The London-based advertising agency took a writeoff of about $76
milllso in June, Saaion on the sales, and cited them for its inability
to pay the
dividend.
   A Saatchi spokesman said that although there are funds to pay a
dividend, it would involve getting the permission of bond holders
and paying a high price to obtain that permission.
   ``We didn't think it was prudent to squander the funds at the
moment,'' said the spokesman, who requested anonymity.
   The spokesman also said that the problem was ``largely
technical'' and that payments would yment was a
``reflection of the fact that they have a balance sheet which is in
a fragile state.''
   ``It saves them 6 million pounds (about $11 million) a year
which is a sensible move at this point in time,'' Sheppard said.
   Losses are also expected from the sale of the Gartner Group
Inc., a Stamford, Conn.-based consultancy being sold to an
investment management group for $55 million in cash and $15 million
in notes and other obligations. Saatchi bought the group in June
1988 for $86 million.

   Stock prices rose in quiet trading today,
recovering some of Thursday's losses.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 31.93 on Thursday,
climbed 22.03 to 2,618.32 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 8 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 851 up, 535 down and
506 unchanged.
   Analysts said the Labor Department's report for August on the
employment situation suggested continuing weakness in the economy _
but not enough evidence of trouble to warrant action by the Federal
Reserve to relax its credit policy.
   Thus, the data seemed to provide little encouragement for
traders on the outlook for either interest rates or corporate
profits.
   The civilian unemployment rate increased from 5.5 percent in
July to 5.6 percent last month. Nonfarm payroll employment dropped
by 75,000 jobs, after a revised decline of 89,000 in July.
   Interest rates rose in the government bond market after the
report was issued.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Philip Morris rose { to 45\;

<HEAD>Crop Futures Fall on Profit-Taking, Fading Export Hopes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices fell moderately
Friday amid profit-taking and fading expectations that the United
States will grant agricultural export credits to the Soviet Union
soon.
   Forecasts for rain this weekend in the Mississippi Delta region,
where soybeans have been stressed by dry, hot conditions, also
weighed on the soybean complex, said Pat O'Connell, grains analyst
with Refco Inc. in Chicago.
   ``It's kind of a wait-and-see attitude,'' he said. ``If it rains
a little less than expected, we'll be back up on Monday. If it's a
little more than expected, we'll go another leg down.''
   The soybean, soybean meal and wheat markets posted strong gains
earlier this week on hopes that President Bush and Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev would strike a deal on export credits during
their summit meeting Sunday.
   But talk circulated Friday that the State Department was opposed
to granting credit to the Soviets unless Moscow lifts emigration
restrictions that have prevented the United States from designating
the Soviet Union a most-favored trading partner.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1} cents to 4{ cents lower with
the contract for delivery in September at $2.62 a bushel; corn was
1{ cents to 4{ cents lower with September at $2.38{ a bushel; oats
were } cent to 2{ cents lower with September at $1.08} a bushel;
soybeans were 3 cents to 5} cents lower with September at $6.12{ a

<HEAD>Oil Executives, Analysts Fear Gulf Crisis Could Cause Gasoline
Shortages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even minor disruptions of gasoline supply
channels could cause shortages at gas pumps this winter because of
the Persian Gulf crisis, oil industry leaders and analysts warned
Friday.
   The problem isn't just that the cutoff of Iraqi and Kuwaiti
supplies has reduced flow by nearly 2 million barrels a day. It's
that the replacement oil, mainly from stepped-up Saudi Arabian
production, is heavier and contains more sulfur.
   That means less of the lighter petroleum products like gasoline,
jet fuel, diesel and home heating oil can be extracted from each
barrel. And the coking and cracking units that break down the
heavier oil are already running at near capacity, the experts said
in a series of interviews this week.
   ``We are really on the razor's edge with no margin for error,''
said George Baker, an energy analyst with Merrill Lynch Research in
New York.
   ``As we go into the fourth quarter, there's a potential for it
getting tight,'' said Lodwrick M. Cook, the chief executive of Los
Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield Co.
   Their worries followed warnings by Bush administration officials
and other private analysts this week that oil shortages could
develop out of the Mideast crisis.
   Baker said shortages at the pumps might be caused this winter by
something as minor as the fire that recently knocked out part of
Shell's refinery in Deer Park, Texas.
   He noted that during last year's fourth quarter, at least two
such events occurred: A fire at an Exxon refinery in Baton Rouge,
La., and Hurricane Hugo's assault on an Amerada Hess facility in
St. Croix, Virgin Islands.
   ``Any prolonged outages would change it from the razor's edge of
balance to a situation where people actually might not be able to
get gas,'' Baker said.
   He and Cook shied away from using shock words from the '70s,
like ``gas lines.'' But Baker suggested that some form of
rationing, such as shorter hours of operation or 10-gallon limits,
might be seen at gas pumps during the fourth and first quarters.
   Cook said it was too early to make predictions, but he finds the
situation worrisome. Although gasoline use drops as winter
approaches, use of heating oil rises, he noted in an interview.
Home heating oil also is one of the lighter products made from
crude oil.
   ``If you look at purely the arithmetic, we ought to be able to
get through. But there's a lot of other factors,'' Cook said. The
unknowns include whether suppliers at any stage hold back, hoping
for higher prices later. Panic buying by drivers could also could
cause problems, he said.
   ``If people decide to hoard supplies, if people decide to top
off their tanks, there could be problems,'' Cook said.
   Another chief executive, Robert McClements Jr. of Sun Co. in
Radnor, Pa., rearranged his agenda at a meeting with analysts in
New York last week to address the problems caused by the heavier
crude. He'd been scheduled to talk about the clean-air legislation
making its way through Congress.
   McClements estimated the cutoff of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude oil
and refined products may produce a shortfall equivalent to 1.95
million barrels of crude a day. Even if higher prices cut demand,
the shortfall is likely to remain at 1.5 million barrels per day.
   The heavier oil on average will yield 8 percent or 9 percent
less of the light-end products such as gasoline than the light
sweet crude oil it is replacing, McClements told the analysts. With
refineries already operating at near capacity, it will be hard to
compensate for that, he said.
   ``The message was the tight market's out there already. Refiners
are at very high levels of utilization,'' said Timothy R. Hughes,
Sun Co.'s director of investor relations.
   ``Products like gasoline and distillates (such as home heating
oil) are going to be very tight,'' he said.
   ``It's possible that we'd get back to gas lines or rationing in
some form if this keeps up,'' Hughes said.

   With its dim lights, glittering chrome and
glass-polishing bartenders, Aqua Bar Genryu looks like many other
Tokyo watering holes.
   But at this cozy bar, water is the hardest thing on the menu. In
fact, it's the only thing on the menu.
   Designer water, in dozens and dozens of brands, has flooded the
Japanese market, with imports expected to more than double this
year. And at Aqua Bar they drink it straight.
   The bar, on the sixth floor of an upscale Seibu department
store, is near boutiques for designer brands Chanel and Piaget.
   ``We get maybe 100 or 120 customers in here a day,'' said
bartender Masamitsu Matsumoto. ``They may not know their water very
well, but they know this is the fashion.''
   According to Yoshio Yamamoto, executive director of the Japan
Mineral Water Association, the market this year is expected to be
about $103.4 million, with imports forecast to go up 137 percent
from last year.
   Sales of domestic brands, which make up about 85 percent of the
Japanese market, are expected to increase roughly 20 percent, he
said.
   ``Sales tooink something clean.''
   Kazuhiro Uda, head of the Tokyo Waterworks Department's Water
Quality Section, disagreed. ``Mineral water is just a fad.''
   But he acknowledged that legal requirements for chlorine tend to
create ``somewhat smelly water.''
   ``Each summer we also have some problems with mold, and I
suppose some people have begun to lose confidence in us,'' he said.
``But what's important is that wherever you go in Japan you can
turn on the tap and get clean, drinkable water.''

<HEAD>British Government Wants Coffee, Cocoa Bodies to Remain in London</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British government is preparing to fight off
any overseas bid to attract the international coffee and cocoa
organizations, officials said Thursday.
   ``The U.K. government wishes to keep the organizations in London
and is doing everything possible to get the best deal possible (on
rents),'' said an official from the Ministry of Agriculture,
speaking anonymously.
   Her comment followed a statement by Dutch officials attending
the first day of International Cocoa Organization talks here that
their government was considering offering the 41-nation body a new
home in the Netherlands.
   In June, the West German government said it was likely to
support a bid being drawn up by the state of Hamburg to attract the
73-nation International Coffee Organization away from London.
   Neither government has yet made formal bids for the two
organizations, which provide a forum for producing and consuming
countries to discuss matters of mutual concern.
   In the past the organizations have also operated
price-stabilization treaties for both commodities.
   The lease on their present shared headquarters in central
London, which is held by the British Agriculture Ministry, expires
in May 1991. The landlords are seeking a rent increase.
   Both organizations are eager to keep down costs to member
governments.
   The Ministry of Agriculture has appointed agents to negotiate
the rent and look at cheaper alternative headquarters in the
capital.
   Last year the British government guaranteed rent subsidies to
the international wheat and sugar organizations in a successful bid
to persuade them to remain in London in the face of offers of
alternative accommodation in Paris, Brussels, Belgium and
Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
   Commodity industry sources said the departure of the coffee and
cocoa organizations would damage London's prestige as the world's
commodity center.

<HEAD>USX Launches Investment at Historic Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRADDOCK, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USX Corp. returned to its roots Friday to
launch a $250 million investment in a historic steel mill, saying
the project will ensure the survival of steel in the industry's
cradle.
   The company broke ground for a continuous slab caster at the
115-year-old Edgar Thomson mill, Andrew Carnegie's first steel
plant, in the depressed Monongahela Valley region near Pittsburgh.
   In continuous casting, molten steel is poured into a caster that
shapes it into slabs up to 36 feet long. The process eliminates
several steps in making flat-rolled steel, saving time and money
and improving quality.
   ``In marking the start of this construction project, we are also
marking the beginning of a new era in steelmaking in the Mon Valley
region,'' said USX Chairman Charles A. Corry.
   ``The company is undertaking this large investment on the
premise that world-class, quality steel products can be produced at
competitive costs in the Mon Valley,'' he said.
   The caster, which will be completed in mid-1992, will have an
annual capacity of 2.6 million tons.
   The company is building the caster under terms of a labor
agreement reached with the United Steelworkers of America in 1987.
It plans to begin renovating the hot strip mill at its nearby Irvin
plant later this year for another $250 million. Millions more are
being spent to renovate the nearby Clairton coke ovens.
   Some years ago, Corry said, there were serious questions about
whether the company's steel division would still be operating in
the valley in 1990, ``let alone investing a quarter of a billion
dollars for modernization.''
   ``While this project is not without risks, we are confident that
with the dedicated support and cooperation of our employees and the
community we can succeed,'' he said.
   There aren't many steelworkers left in the Mon Valley, an area
hit hard by plant closings in the 1980s.
   The caster will mean the loss of an unknown number of jobs, but
union and business leaders agree the improvement means job security
for most of the 4,000 people who work at Thomson and the two other
USX plants in the valley.
   The project will create about 550 construction jobs, and civic
leaders hope the casters will draw other industries to the area.
   Bethlehem Steel Corp. joined USX in hailing the improvements
Friday. The company said it will invest $100 million in its
Johnstown production facility if it obtains labor concessions from
the steelworkers union.
   Sufficient concessions would allow the company to make major
improvements, including another new continuous caster and
modernization of an existing bar mill to permit rod production,
said Bethlehem Chairman Walter Williams.
   The Bar, Rod and Wire Division headquarters plant in Johnstown
employs about 2,000 workers, while the division's plants in
Lackawanna, N.Y., and Sparrows Point, Md., employ 350 workers
apiece.
   The current pact, which expires July 31, 1993, calls for
modifications to the agreement for plants having financial
difficulties, ``and the Bar, Rod and Wire Division is one of
them,'' said company spokesman Henry Von Spreckelsen.
   He would not indicate what form of concessions the company is
seeking and would only say the division has lost ``millions of
dollars since its formation in 1983.''
   ``It must be competitive on its own terms,'' he said. ``In this
case we're saying for an unprofitable operation to survive requires
a reduction in production costs, through a reduction in labor
costs, and more efficient facilities.
   ``We've made some progress, but it hasn't been sufficient.''

<HEAD>Fed Stays Out of Foreign Exchange Market For First Time Since 1986</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   The government did not intervene in the foreign
exchange markets to support the dollar's value from May through
July, the first time in four years it has refrained from taking
action during one of its quarterly reporting periods, officials
said Friday.
   Federal Reserve System officials said the dollar's slide against
the German mark, British pound and Japanese yen during the quarter
was not seen as a threat.
   ``This does not mean we're out of the intervention business or a
change in policy or a change in approach,'' said Sam Y. Cross,
executive vice president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank,
which manages foreign-exchange operations for the Fed.
   During the three months ended July 31, the dollar's value
declined 8 percent against the yen, 5{ percent against the mark and
12 percent against the pound, Cross said at a news conference.
   It was the first time since August-October 1986 that the
nation's central bank refrained from selling or buying dollars to
affect the value of the currency during a quarter, the Fed said.
   The Fed attempts to regulate the value of the dollar against
other currencies either by selling or buying dollars in foreign
exchange markets, where various currencies are bought and sold much
like soybeans or barrels of oil.
   If the central bank believes the dollar is undervalued, it will
buy dollars to limit their supply on world markets in the hope that
will prop up their value. If it believes the dollar is too strong,
it will sell dollars from its reserves to try to lower their value
through the law of supply and demand.
   Such interventions are not always successful, but they can
change the dollar's value over the short term, particularly when
central banks of other nations join in.
   A strong dollar makes imported goods cheaper, but makes U.S.
exports more expensive on world markets. A weak dollar, conversely,
makes imports more expensive but benefits exporters.
   Cross said the Fed did not view the dollar's decline against
other major currencies during May-July to be a major threat to the
economy, or that the dollar was ``being pushed inappropriately one
way or another.''
   He also said there was no panic movement of the dollar in the
markets that may have prompted the Fed to intervene.
   ``We certainly do not try to keep the dollar at a rigid level,''
he added.
   He said domestic issues in Japan, Germany and Great Britain were
in large part responsible for the rise in those currencies against
the dollar. However, the dollar also was weakened later in the
three-month period by signs that the U.S. economy was
deteriorating, he said.
   The Fed was not completely out of the foreign exchange market,
however. On behalf of the Treasury, it sold 1 billion marks for
dollars on the open market and sold another 1 billion marks for
dollars directly to another central bank, Cross said.
   But these transactions were timed to have little or no impact on
the dollar's value, he said. They were undertaken as part of the
Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund to adjust balances and to
enable the fund to eliminate some of the foreign currency it stores
with the Fed.
   The Treasury earned a profit of about $330 million from the
currency dealings, Cross said.

   A surprise audit of 30 radio and TV stations
indicates most apparently were overcharging for political
advertising, a Federal Communications Commission official said
Friday.
   Roy J. Stewart, chief of the FCC's mass media bureau, said the
charges were not necessarily deliberate and that the commission
would not impose sanctions pending further investigation.
   ``I would prefer to think they (broadcasters) are not aware of
their full range of responsibilities ... in carrying out the law,''
Stewart said. He said no more audits were planned and that no final
determinations had been made regarding any violations by individual
stations.
   Instead, the FCC will increase its efforts to educate station
executives in the intricacies of political advertising laws,
Stewart said.
   Broadcasters said they were making good-faith efforts to comply
with complicated rules.
   ``Historically, the commission has not done a good job of
educating broadcasters to the various nuances in this important
area,'' said Edward O. Fritts, president of the National
Association of Broadcasters.
   The FCC can impose sanctions ranging from a letter of admonition
to fines totaling $250,000. In April the commission fined an
Indianapolis television station, WXIN, $10,000 for violating the
political ad rules.
   The July 16-17 audit indicated widespread overcharging at 16 of
20 TV stations and four of eight radio stations. Two other radio
stations sold no political ads during the time audited.
   At one TV station, candidates paid $5,500 to run a 30-second ad
in a time slot that cost commercial advertisers no more than
$3,000, Stewart said.
   Stewart would not identify any of the stations that may have
been in violation. He said they first would be given a chance to
respond to the commission's inquiries before a final determination
of any violations were made.
   The audit reviewed the stations' compliance with federal rules
requiring that candidates have equal opportunities _ commonly
referred to as equal time _ to appear on stations and that stations
sell ads to candidates at the lowest rates fr specific time slots.
   Political advertising rates are a sore spot in Congress, where
proposals are pending to guarantee that candidates get the lowest
rates without fear of being preempted by commercial advertisers who
later offer to pay higher prices.
   The bureau said broadcasters' ``sales techniques encouraged
(candidates) to buy higher-priced classes of time.''
   ``It appears from the audit that certain industry practices are
not in compliance with the law, and that political candidates have
paid higher prices than commercial advertisers at a majority of the
stations,'' the bureau said.
   Besides the pricing problems, the audit found many stations
weren't keeping adequate records to allow candidates to determine
whether they should be getting equal time with opponents.
   One proponent of tougher political ad rules, Sen. John Danforth,
R-Mo., said the FCC's audit ``confirms what candidates have known
for some time, that broadcasters routinely ignore the law'' on ad
pricing.
   The inspections _ the first of their kind _ were carried out in
Cincinnati; Dallas-Fort Worth; Philadelphia; Portland, Ore.; and
San Francisco. The commission said the stations were chosen because
of their diverse locations and because they serve large areas.
   Jeff Rosser, general manager at one of the stations, KDFW-TV in
Dallas, said officials there thought they had been complying, but
found problems when they conducted their own audit.
   ``One could argue that we did overcharge, not by design, but by
not being totally aware of the small print and the intricacies of a
very complicated rule,'' Rosser said Friday.
   Dirk Brinkerhoff, general manager of KTXA-TV in Dallas, and
Charles D. Schwartz, general manager of WWDB-FM in Philadelphia,
said their stations would be found in compliance.
   Jim Wood, general manager of WWNK-FM in Cincinnati, said his
station did not sell political ads during the audit period.
   The other audited stations were:
   Cincinnati _ WCPO-TV, WKRC-TV, WLWT-TV, WIII-TV and WCKY-AM.
   Dallas-Fort Worth _ KXAS-TV, WFAA-TV, KRLD-AM and KPLX-FM.
   Philadelphia _ KYW-TV, WCAU-TV, WPVI-TV, WGBS-TV and WPEN-AM.
   Portland, Ore. _ KATU-TV, KGW-TV, KOIN-TV, KPTV, KWJJ-AM and
KKSN-FM.
   San Francisco _ KGO-TV, KRON-TV, KTVU-TV, KOFY-TV, KNBR-AM and
KABL-FM.

   Venture capitalist William Connell was named
Friday as president and chief operating officer of Whittle
Communications.
   Connell, 50, will be taking posts at the Knoxville, Tenn.-based
media company that have been vacant since Nicholas Glover stepped
down two years ago.
   Chairman Christopher Whittle said he has known Connell for most
of a decade and found him to be a broad-gauged business leader.
   ``His presence will allow me to devote my time to development
and marketing while he focuses internally on the needs and morale
of our work force which makes all of our ideas work,'' Whittle said.
   Connell has operated a venture capital business called Peregrine
Capital Partners of Cincinnati, specializing in securing financing
for optical businesses and day care centers.
   He had previously worked for 25 years at Procter &amp; Gamble,
heading its $300 million bar soap and laundry products division in
Canada at one point and later its $800 million U.S. beauty care
division.
   Whittle Communications, a private company that is 50 percent
owned by Time Warner Inc., specializes in creating media vehicles
ranging from magazines, sponsored posters and video programs to
sampling kits and books that are designed to appeal to narrowly
defined audiences.
   Its Channel One TV news show with commercials is designed to run
in high school classrooms. It has created magazines for beauty
parlors and doctor's waiting rooms, wall media for school lobbies
and sponsored books sent free to American opinion leaders.
   The company employs 1,000 people and expects to generate revenue
of $230 million this year.

<HEAD>Oil Dips, But Stays Above $30 a Barrel, as Traders Take Profits</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Oil prices fell Friday as traders sold futures
to pocket their profits from Thursday's surge over $31 a barrel,
but crude stayed higher for the week amid fears of supply shortages
this winter.
   ``There was really no news to go on,'' said Ed Kevelson, a
trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``It was a Friday, so people
were more likely to take profits.''
   Light sweet crude for October delivery fell $1.39 to $30.04 per
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Later contract months
also fell.
   For the four-day trading week, shortened by the Labor Day
holiday, October crude was up $2.72 per barrel following
speculation that the Persian Gulf crisis may drag on. Prices also
gained in response to government statements that supply shortages
could be on the way.
   Unleaded gasoline for October delivery dropped 2.01 cents to
93.06 cents per gallon on Friday. Later contract months were also
down.
   Home heating oil fell 4.26 cents to 83.98 cents per gallon for
October, while later months were also down.
   Gasoline was down 3.26 cents for the week, while heating oil was
up 8.09 cents over the four-day period.
   Friday's fall in oil prices helped boost the stock market. The
Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 23.26 to 2,619.55,
finishing the week with a gain of 5.19 points.
   Kevelson said oil made a steadier rise above the $30-per-barrel
threshold this week than it had two weeks earlier, when it hit that
level for the first time in nearly five years.
   Although no major news or rumors were moving the markets Friday,
the bits of news that traders were watching tended to help keep
prices down.
   Friday's selling was partly attributable to a report that the
Saudis would be able to increase vastly their crude production by
the end of the year.
   Anticipations that President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev would issue a joint statement on the Persian Gulf
after their summit Sunday in Helsinki, Finland, were also helping
to keep oil prices lower.
   Traders were also calmed by more airlifting of hostages out of
territory controlled by Iraq.
   Among other energy futures traded Friday on the Merc, natural
gas settled at $1.510 per 1,000 cubic feet, compared with $1.530 a
day earlier and $1.500 a week earlier.

   Stock prices closed out a week of erratic swings
with a moderate rally Friday as oil prices fell.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 23.26 to 2,619.55,
finishing the week with a net gain of 5.19 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
922 up, 560 down and 488 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 123.80 million
shares, against 125.62 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 148.63 million shares.
   Analysts said a drop in oil prices helped encourage some
sporadic buying. Crude oil futures for October delivery fell $1.39
a barrel to $30.04 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   But the advance got little help from a lackluster report on the
state of the economy.
   The Labor Department's report for August on the employment
situation signaled continuing weakness in economic activity _ but
apparently not enough evidence of trouble to warrant action by the
Federal Reserve to relax its credit policy.
   Thus, the data seemed provided little encouragement for traders
on the outlook for either interest rates or corporate profits.
   The civilian unemployment rate increased from 5.5 percent in
July to 5.6 percent last month. Nonfarm payroll employment dropped
by 75,000 jobs, after a revised decline of 89,000 in July.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Philip Morris rose { to 45\;
General Electric | to 60|; McDonald's 1&lsqb; to 27~; International
Business Machines 3&lsqb; to 105{, and Pepsico } to 25\.
   UAL climbed 8 to 100\, bolstered by revived talk about efforts
to put together a buyout plan for the company among employees,
management and outside investors.
   UAL shares traded as high as 294 in 1989 before a planned
$300-a-share buyout went sour for lack of financing.
   Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber dropped 1| to 20|. On Thursday the
company said it expects to report a net loss for the third quarter
of about $65 million, which would represent its biggest quarterly
deficit ever.
   Oracle Systems tumbled 1} to 8&lsqb; in the over-the-counter market.
The company said it would post a loss for the fiscal first quarter
ended Aug. 31.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $22.39 billion, or
0.74 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 1.45 to 177.51.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 3.17 to 382.65, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 2.94 at 323.40.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
1.60 to 380.38. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 323.77, down .73.

<TEXT>
   President Bush and
congressional leaders resumed budget talks Friday as lawmakers said
foreign payments for U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf would ease
some _ but not all _ pressure on the deficit.
   After a five-week break for Congress' summer vacation,
negotiators returned to work in the main bar of the base Officers'
Club, 10 miles from the capitol.
   Their goal was to finish by Monday a $50 billion package of tax
boosts and spending cuts for next year and $500 billion in savings
over the next five years. Reporters were confined to another
building on the base about two miles away in an effort to reduce
interruptions.
   Democrats and Republicans swapped plans Friday afternoon as the
bargaining began, said officials who asked to not be identified.
   The administration proposal calls for $52.5 billion in savings
next year and $513.2 billion over the next five years, one official
said. It is similar to the budget Bush proposed in January, and to
a July administration plan never formally released but revealed by
GOP bargainers.
   The proposal calls for $4 billion in defense cuts and $15.5
billion in reductions in benefit programs, including Medicare.
   It seeks $20.4 billion in new taxes, including levies on alcohol
and limits on the deduction allowed for state and local income
taxes. It also calls for a cut in the capital gains tax rate, which
Bush says would raise money by encouraging the sale of real estate
and other property.
   Fewer details of the Democratic proposal were known. An official
said it relied heavily on defense cuts and taxes, including levies
on energy. The plan took no account of the costs of U.S. military
operations in the Persian Gulf, the official said.
   Democrats have argued that the costs of Operation Desert Shield
are similar to a one-time emergency and should not be counted in
the government's long-range budgeting.
   Unless lawmakers and the administration enact a deal by Oct. 1,
the Gramm-Rudman law will impose about $100 billion in cuts to most
defense and domestic programs. Most participants on both sides say
slashes of that amount would be so harsh that they could not be
allowed to stand very long.
   Bargainers want to finish their work at Andrews by Monday to
give Congress a chance to write the plan into law.
   As the talks began, bargainers reaffirmed their goal of slicing
$50 billion off of next year's federal deficit.
   ``Nothing has happened anywhere that makes me less interested in
getting this budget deficit under control once and for all,'' Bush
told reporters as he arrived at the base for a 30-minute visit to
the talks.
   ``If we needed a budget agreement five weeks ago, we need one
more today,'' said House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.
   Since the talks recessed in late July, the economy has shown
signs of weakening and Iraq and the United States have faced off in
what may be a long-term standoff in the Persian Gulf.
   Legislators welcomed the news that Saudi Arabia, the exiled
government of Kuwait, Japan and South Korea would be paying the
United States billions of dollars to defray the costs of American
forces in the Middle East.
   ``It helps out a little,'' said Rep. Silvio Conte, R-Mass.
   But with U.S. military expenses in the gulf expected to run
about $1 billion per month _ barring large-scale fighting _ Conte
and others cautioned that there was no reason to expect that the
foreign help would put a major dent in the federal deficit.
   The administration has estimated that unless some savings are
found, next year's deficit would be a record $250 billion. Fiscal
1991 begins Oct. 1.
   Republicans have been optimistic that because of the
confrontation with Iraq, cuts to the $290 billion defense budget
will be limited.
   ``I think we'll have an orderly defense build-down now,'' said
Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas. ``I think we're not going to have the
defense meltdown some people thought.''
   Democrats have sought defense cuts more in the $9 billion to $16
billion range.
   Other important differences remained between Democrats and
Republicans.
   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said Republicans were hoping for a
package that would rely slightly more on spending cuts than on tax
increases in the first year. Democrats want the two components to
be equal in size.
   Domenici, Gramm and Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan. _
all from energy-producing states _ said they wanted a plan that
encouraged energy production with enticements such as tax credits.
   Democrats said they want a package that encourages the United
States to move toward energy independence, with some officials
saying privately that they have discussed some sort of new taxes on
energy.
   ``Big differences remain,'' Bush said. ``It's going to take
compromise.''

<HEAD>Dollar Rises Against Most Currencies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar gained against most major currencies
except the Japanese yen Friday in a session traders described as
eventless.
   Gold prices were marginally mixed. On the Commodity Exchange in
New York, a troy ounce of gold for September delivery fell 20 cents
to close at $389.50. Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of
$390.00 for an ounce, up 15 cents from Thursday's 4 p.m. EDT bid.
   The dollar firmed slightly in reaction to a government report
showing the nation's jobless rate rose to 5.6 percent in August
from 5.5 percent the month before, traders said.
   ``I think people were anticipating a far worse figure,'' said
Harlan Matusow, an assistant vice president in currency trading at
the New York office of Bank Julius Baer &amp; Co.
   Analysts said a bad unemployment report could have persuaded the
Federal Reserve to ease credit. Lower interest rates tend to weaken
the dollar.
   Much of the dollar's advance the rest of the day appeared to
stem from investors covering short positions by buying dollars, he
said.
   Traders who anticipated a worse unemployement report, and had
been selling dollars, decided to cover their positions, he said.
   In addition, since the start of the Iraqi crisis, investors have
been afraid to hold short positions over weekends for fear the
dollar's value could be adversely affected by events before the
market reopens on Monday, he said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 140.25 Japanese yen from
141.65 yen at Thursday's close. Later, in London, it fell to 140.15
yen. In New York, the dollar was quoted at 140.05 yen at late
afternoon, down from 140.65 late Thursday.
   The dollar rose against the British pound. The pound cost
$1.8933 in London, cheaper than $1.9075 late Thursday. In New York,
the pound was quoted at $1.8930 at late afternoon, down from
$1.9125 late Thursday.

   Ford Motor Co. said Friday it would shut
down a truck plant in Ohio and a car plant in Georgia next week
because of high inventories and a shortage of dealer orders.
   The company said its Lorain, Ohio, plant, which makes Ford
Econoline vans, and its Atlanta factory, which makes Ford Taurus
and Mercury Sable cars, would be closed in the week of Sept. 10.
   About 2,500 hourly workers will be laid off in Atlanta and about
2,000 in Ohio.
   Ford spokesman Joel Pitcoff said there were 92 selling days
worth of unsold Econolines on dealer lots at the end of last month.
Inventories stood at 66 days for Taurus and 74 days for Sable.
   The closing didn't sit well with Bill Allen, president of United
Auto Workers union Local 425 in Lorain. The union is involved in
local contract negotiations with the automaker.
   He said workers weren't told of the layoffs until after they
reported for work Friday.
   ``Ford agreed to let us know a week to 10 days in advance of a
layoff. They have no regard for workers whatsoever. It just creates
total chaos,'' he said.
   Pitcoff said under normal circumstances the company will inform
workers a week to 10 days before a planned shutdown. He said this
notification came later because the company was trying to find
other orders to justify continuation of production.

<TEXT>
   Eagle-Picher Industries Inc. has been
financially devastated by liability for asbestos disease claims and
faces insolvency by the end of 1992, a court-ordered report
released Friday said.
   The report by former federal judge Marvin E. Frankel marked a
major step in implementing a national class action for thousands of
lawsuits filed against companies with insufficient assets to pay
asbestos claims.
   The 24-page document was a stark portrayal of a company
struggling under the weight of asbestos claims, which form the
biggest product liability matter in U.S. history. Eagle-Picher,
based in Cincinnati, is a maker of industrial products that used
asbestos widely for years.
   Frankel said Eagle-Picher has more than 64,000 asbestos claims
pending with another 20,000 being filed annually. The company's
1988 forecast of $613 million in asbestos liability was too
optimistic, he said, and it faces a cash shortfall of up to $75
million by 1992.
   ``There is, in a word, a clear danger for disaster for
Eagle-Picher within the next two years,'' the report said. ``There
is a strong prospect of insolvency by the end of 1992.''
   Frankel also said there is a ``clear risk'' the company will not
be able to pay future claimants seeking to recover for asbestos
injuries or deaths. Inhaled asbestos fibers can cause lung cancer
and other respiratory ailments many years after the fact.
   ``At this time Eagle-Picher's options appear limited,'' Frankel
said. ``Aggressive settlement of claims and aggressive litigation
both require cash flow beyond current expectations.''
   Frankel was appointed as a special master in the case last month
by U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein. Frankel said Eagle-Picher
met legal requirements for its claims to be converted into a class
action.
   Weinstein has said he plans to pool the resources of
Eagle-Picher and up to five other companies that don't have the
money to fight cases in court or pay present and future claims.
   Weinstein's effort is part of a three-tiered plan to resolve 20
years of contentious litigation and clear state and federal courts
nationwide of some 90,000 asbestos lawsuits.
   The judge has said he expects to combine funds from Eagle-Picher
and the other companies with money from the Manville trust to
settle claims.
   The Manville trust, formed after Manville Corp. reorganized in
bankruptcy court, is in the process of being overhauled. A plan for
Manville Corp. to inject up to $520 million in new money into the
trust was announced Friday.
   Frankel said Eagle-Picher has paid out $5,990 per claim to
settle about 64,000 claims to date, sharply higher than 1988
estimates. It also doled out $35 million on legal expenses last
year while generating $27 million less from operations than
projected.
   Eagle-Picher has been forced to sell off businesses to meet its
asbestos claims, but even the recent divestiture of three divisions
fell short by $12.3 million. Also, its remaining insurance for
fiscal 1990 and 1991 is just $8 million, $17 million less than
anticipated.
   ``The result is a picture . . . that is fraught with risks going
to the company's very survival, let alone its ability to meet its
asbestos liabilities,'' Frankel said.
   In addition to the fund created by Eagle-Picher and the other
companies, a second part of the national asbestos plan called for a
group of healthy companies facing claims to form a settlement fund
in Cleveland.
   But that attempt was struck down by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in Cincinnati, which said federal Judge Thomas D.
Lambros did not have the right to consolidate cases outside his
jurisdiction.
   The third phase of the plan _ a class action of cases that would
go to trial _ is proceeding before federal Judge Robert M. Parker
in Beaumont, Texas, where a hearing is set for next Friday.

   KCPL launched an $857 million, or $27 per share, takeover of

   Kansas Gas' motion Friday asked regulators to deny KCPL's

claims FERC should wait until a federal lawsuit challenging the

   The motion filed with FERC said ``it would not be in the public

<HEAD>Copper Futures Soar on Supply Concerns, Technicals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices soared more than 7 cents a pound to their
highest levels in nearly a year Friday, reflecting renewed concerns
that labor and production problems will lead to further tightening
of supplies.
   On other commodity markets, precious metals were mixed; oil
futures fell sharply; grains and soybeans were lower; and livestock
and meat futures were mixed.
   Copper futures settled 3.9 cents to 7.25 cents higher on New
York's Commodity Exchange with the contract for spot delivery up
7.25 cents at $1.3545 a pound, the highest settlement of a
near-term copper contract since Sept. 22, 1989.
   The most heavily traded contract, for December delivery,
finished 6.95 cents higher at $1.3035 a pound.
   The rally followed an advance of 2.05 cents in the September
contract on Thursday, making for a two-day gain of 9.3 cents or
about 7.4 percent.
   Analysts said the surge in buying interest was prompted in part
by reports of production setbacks or labor problems in a number of
copper-producing countries including Chile, Peru, Zambia and Zaire.
   Frederick Demler, metals analyst with PaineWebber Inc., said two
key developments were the shutdown due to environmental problems of
an Exxon Corp. copper smelter in Chile and the rejection of a
contract offer by striking copper miners in Peru.
   ``There are a number of production problems around the world and
there are still relatively low worldwide inventories,'' Demler said.
   Tom Blaney, metals specialist with Balfour Maclaine Corp., said
Friday's stronger stock market and steep drop in oil prices
bolstered confidence in the economy and contribued to copper's
gains.
   The Japanese were heavy buyers of copper, analysts said.
Speculative funds also bought large amounts after the December
contract surpassed $1.26 a pound, previously a point of a
resistance.
   Gold futures edged lower on the Commodity Exchange, ending a
three-day rally, but silver futures continued to advance.
   Gold settled 20 cents to 30 cents lower with September at
$389.50 a troy ounce; silver was 2.4 cents to 3 cents higher with
September at $4.80 a troy ounce.
   Crude oil futures gave back nearly all of Thursday's gains on
the New York Mercantile Exchange as the standoff in the Persian
Gulf appeared to sway in the direction of a peaceful settlement.
   A U.S.-chartered airlift plucked 165 Americans from occupied
Kuwait on Friday and carried them to safety in Jordan, raising
hopes the pace of freedom flights might quicken.
   And as President Bush prepared to meet with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Sunday to try to break the desert deadlock,
Japan, South Korea and Kuwait promised financial aid to defray the
cost of keeping 100,000 American troops in the Gulf region.
   Light sweet crude oil futures settled 95 cents to $1.45 lower
with October at $30.04 a barrel; heating oil was 3.51 cents to 4.26
cents lower with October at 83.98 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was 2.01 cents to 3.99 cents lower with October at 93.06 cents a
gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures prices fell moderately on the Chicago
Board of Trade amid profit-taking and fading expectations that the
United States will grant agricultural export credits to the Soviet
Union soon.
   Forecasts for rain this weekend in the Mississippi Delta region,
where soybeans have been stressed by dry, hot conditions, also
weighed on the soybean complex, said Pat O'Connell, grains analyst
with Refco Inc. in Chicago.
   Wheat futures settled 2} cents to 3{ cents lower with September
at $2.62} a bushel; corn was 1{ cents to 4\ cents lower with
September at $2.38} a bushel; oats were 2\ cents to 2} cents lower
with September at $1.08{ a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents to 5\
cents lower with September at $6.12\ a bushel.
   Cattle futures rose modestly on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
in line with stronger cash cattle prices.
   Pork futures ended narrowly mixed ahead of Sunday's U.S.-Soviet
summit meeting, which some analysts believe could produce an
agreement on food export credits for the Soviets.
   Live cattle futures settled unchanged to .48 cent higher with
October at 77.97 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower
to .53 cent higher with September at 87.37 cents a pound; hogs
futures were .25 cent lower to .32 cent higher with October at
49.35 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .10 cent lower to .07
cent higher with February at 52.12 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Rise as Oil Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government bond prices rose Friday as an oil
price drop dampened inflation fears and an employment report
offered some signs of a weakening economy.
   The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond gained &rsqb; point, or $3.75
per 1,000 face amount. Its yield declined to 8.91 percent from late
Thursday's 8.95 percent.
   Prices fell in morning trading after the government said August
employment data showed weakness in the labor market _ but not
enough to induce the Fed to foster an economic revival by lowering
interest rates.
   The report said the civilian unemployment rate increased to 5.6
percent in August from 5.5 percent in July. Non-farm payroll
employment dropped by 75,000 jobs, after a revised decline of
89,000 in July.
   A slight upward revision in the July payroll figures suggested
to credit market participants that conditions in the job market,
while bad, weren't as severe as previously thought.
   That left an ambiguous impression about the economy's health,
which led some bond traders to believe that the Fed will refrain
from acting until a clearer picture emerges.
   But market sentiment later shifted, in large part because oil
futures prices declined, reducing the fear of worsening inflation.
Light sweet crude fell $1.39 to $30.04 per barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   Inflation is bad for the bond market because it erodes the value
of fixed-income securities.
   Scott Winningham, a market analyst at Stone &amp; McCarthy Research
Associates Inc. in Princeton, N.J., said bond prices had been
following the oil market in lockstep until focus shifted to the
employment report earlier this week.
   After the report was released, the focus again returned to oil,
he said.
   ``Fed policy issues apparently are on the back burner as market
participants concluded they are not going to ease imminently,''
Winningham said.
   In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of
short-term governments gained about 3-32 point, intermediate
maturities rose about 5-32 point, and long-term issues were up
about &rsqb; point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial information
service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, gained 1.97 to 1,146.70.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.60 percent as the
discount declined 1 basis point to 7.37 percent. Yields on
six-month bills rose to 7.71 percent as the discount added 1 basis
point to 7.33 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 7.72
percent as the discount dropped 1 basis point to 7.21 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was quoted at 8 percent, down from 8&lsqb;
percent late Thursday.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds closed at 89 19-32, up 1-32 point. The
average yield to maturity held at 7.61 percent from late Thursday.

   Subsidies by European governments to Airbus
Industrie, maker of the Airbus models of large commercial jet
aircraft, threaten the competitiveness of the U.S. aircraft
industry, according to a study prepared for the Commerce Department
released Friday.
   On the average, 74 percent of the cost of developing Airbus
models has been provided by the governments of France, Britain,
West Germany and Spain, Commerce said.
   Member companies in the Airbus consortium have received or have
been pledged more than $13 billion in direct government suppport,
and if they had been required to pay interest at commercial rates,
the value of that support would be $25 billion today, the
department said.
   By the year 2008, Airbus will have paid out $30 billion more
than it will have received, the department's summary concluded.
   If the subsidies continue, competing U.S. manufacturers will
suffer reduced profits, either through lost sales or lower prices,
Commerce said.
   The study was prepared by the consulting firm of Gellman
Research Associates.
   The U.S. office of the European Common Market said in a
statement it had not had time to study the report, but it was
released in the middle of negotiations on the subject between the
United States and the Common Market and was ``therefore untimely
and unhelpful.''
   Commerce says the U.S. aircraft industry earned $12 billion last
year in overseas sales, after deducting the value of imports.
   Airbus' principal competitors are Boeing Corp. of Seattle and
McDonnell-Douglas Corp. of St. Louis, which makes planes at Long
Beach, Calif.

   The nation's civilian unemployment rate hit a
two-year high of 5.6 percent last month, the government said,
reviving worries that the economy is on the brink of a recession _
if not already sliding in.
   The 0.1 percentage point rise, which followed a 0.3 percentage
point increase in July, showed widespread sluggishness. Over the
last two months, the ranks of the jobless have swelled by 550,000,
according to the report issued Friday.
   ``There's a little bit of life, but it looks like it's ebbing

   Even minor disruptions of gasoline supply
channels could cause shortages at gas pumps this winter, industry
leaders and analysts warn.
   The problem isn't just that the cutoff of Iraqi and Kuwaiti
supplies has cut the flow of crude oil. It's that replacement oil,
mainly from stepped-up Saudi Arabian production, is heavier and
contains more sulfur, making it less usable in U.S. refineries,
experts said Friday.

<HEAD>Mineworkers' Leader to be Charged over Accounts</HEAD>

   Two top British mineworkers' leaders will be
charged with improper accounting following an inquiry into union
finances during the 1984-85 miners' strike, a court official said
Friday.
   John Richman, a Sheffield Magistrates' Court clerk, said he had
issued nine summonses against Arthur Scargill, president of the
National Union of Mineworkers, and union general secretary Peter
Heathfield, as well as against the union itself.
   The charges were brought by Trade Union Certification Officer
Matthew Wake, a union watchdog responsible to the Department of
Employment following the inquiry.
   The charges are failure to keep proper accounting records,
failure to maintain a satisfactory system of accounting control,
and failure to submit true and fair accounts in the return for
1989. The two men face fines if convicted.
   ``We have done nothing wrong and we shall contest the action all
the way,'' Scargill said in response.
   ``This is the latest in a long line of attacks on the national
leadership of the miners' union from the establishment who have
never forgiven us for what we did in the 1984-85 miners' strike,''
he said.
   Scargill led the bitter and futile showdown with the government
over the closure of unproductive mines. The union, which had
235,000 members at the time, now has 50,000, and 98 mines have been
closed.
   In July the union sued Scargill to recover 1.4 million pounds,
or about $2.6 million, that had been donated by Soviet and other
East Bloc miners to help the British miners during the strike.
   The court granted the union a delay while it sought to settle
the issue by negotiation, and on Monday, a union delegation heads
to the Paris headquarters of the International Miners' Organization
to determine control of the funds.
