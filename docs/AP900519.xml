   U.S. Customs agents on Friday unveiled a
fortified tunnel under the U.S.-Mexican border and said it had been
used to smuggle at least a ton of cocaine into this country.
   ``It was like something out of a James Bond movie,'' Customs
spokeswoman Judy Turner said.
   The tunnel dubbed ``Cocaine Alley'' was about the length of a
football field and 30 feet underground, authorities said. They said
the smuggling operation included a warehouse and elaborate
entryways on both sides of the border.
   U.S. authorities and Mexican Judicial Police raided the tunnel
late Thursday, using jackhammers and torches to break in, said
Thomas McDermott, head of the U.S. Customs Service in Arizona. Law
enforcement officers found about 25 to 30 pounds of marijuana, but
made no arrests.
   McDermott told reporters that U.S. officials working with
Mexican Judicial Police arrested two men earlier this month in
connection with the smuggling ring.
   McDermott said authorities also confiscated the Agua Prieta,
Mexico, house of businessman Rafael Francisco Camarena and two of
Camarena's businesses _ Douglas Building Supply Co. and Douglas
Redi-Mix Concrete. One entrance of the tunnel is in the house, and
the other end was in a warehouse on the U.S. side of the border.
   Camarena was not in custody. McDermott declined to say whether
there was a warrant for his arrest.
   In Mexico City, the Attorney General's Office said two people
were arrested in the house. The Attorney General's communique was
unclear if those were the same people mentioned as arrested by U.S.
officials. Their names were withheld.
   The northern end of the tunnel was in a Douglas Building
warehouse built eight months ago about 200 feet north of the fence
that divides the two cities. It was just one block from the
unmarked Customs enforcement building and four blocks from the
international port of entry.
   McDermott said that in Camarena's house, excavation was hidden
in the family room beneath an 8-by-12-foot concrete slab holding a
pool table. He said that when an operator turned a small mechanism
shaped like a garden faucet, a hydraulic lift boosted the slab,
with pool table, about 5 feet into the air.
   ``It was a tremendously sophisticated operation,'' McDermott
said. ``This the most unique smuggling operation I have ever come
across.''
   The tunnel was 5 feet high, 4 feet wide, well lighted, and lined
with supports to prevent cave-ins, authorities said. At various
points were compartments where up to 5 tons of drugs could be
stashed.
   Smugglers used a cart to load cocaine and ferry it through the
tunnel, which was up to 40 feet below the surface on the Mexican
side and 30 feet on the U.S. side, officials said.
   On a tour of the warehouse, reporters were shown the northern
entrance: a grate which, when lifted, revealed a 7-foot drop to a
gangway about the size of a small bedroom. That led to a
30-foot-deep well down to the tunnel proper.
   Over the well was a pulley and hoist system apparently used to
raise drug packages.
   The entrance and well were lined with concrete block.
   ``It was just an exceptionally, professionally engineered
tunnel,'' Ms. Turner said. ``It was something that you and I in the
ordinary world would only find in the movies.''
   The smugglers were probably also using the tunnel to transport
profits back to Mexico, said Drug Enforcement Administration agent
Gerard Murphy.
   McDermott said it probably took several months and $1.5 million
to $2 million to build the tunnel. The house and the warehouse,
which provided cover for moving large amounts of dirt, were built
eight months ago.
   McDermott said a geological survey team found the tunnel through
tests which detected ``an anomaly, something below the ground that
shouldn't be there.'' Further tests helped pinpoint the tunnel.
   Ms. Turner said Customs agents who suspected the tunnel's
existence used aerial surveillance to track the shipment of 2,258
pounds of cocaine with an estimated street value of $102 million
from Douglas to a spot outside Phoenix on May 11.
   They confiscated the haul and arrested Caesar Thomas Howard, 44,
of Mesa and Joseph Edward Osborn, 31, of Tempe.
   The cocaine was transported from the warehouse in a
false-bottomed, flatbed truck and had been destined for Southern
California, McDermott said.
   He said authorities knew of no other tunnels, but said they
would be looking. ``This investigation is far from being over,''
McDermott said.

<HEAD>North Notebooks Say Noriega Help for Contras Accepted</HEAD>

   The Reagan administration was accepting
Panamanian Gen. Manuel Noriega's assistance to the Contra rebels in
Nicaragua amid mounting publicity about his involvement in drug
trafficking, according to Oliver North's notebooks.
   North, a former National Security Council aide, and then-CIA
official Duane Clarridge on Aug. 24, 1986, discussed a possible
agenda for a proposed North-Noriega meeting with ``5 steps''
pertaining to ``How to clean up image,'' North's notebooks state.
   The Clarridge-North discussion followed reports in The New York
Times that Noriega was involved in drug trafficking.
   ``Tell (Assistant Secretary of State Elliott) Abrams that
Noriega has asked for meeting'' with North ``re cleaning up
image,'' said a North notebook entry in the meeting with Clarridge,
who then headed the CIA's counterterrorism section.
   A Sept. 3, 1986 meeting with State Department and CIA officers
that focused on Panama mentioned ``Corruption ... drugs-arms
trafficking ... money laundering,'' according to North's notebooks.
   As revealed at North's Iran-Contra trial last year, Noriega met
North met on Sept. 22, 1986, in London, where the Panamanian leader
said he would sabotage Nicaraguan facilities.
   North's notes reflect that Noriega offered to collect
intelligence on an airport, a refinery, electric and telephone
systems and ``Puerto Sandino.'' One entry from the Noriega meeting
reads, ``Killed head of PLO (presumably Palestine Liberation
Organization) in Brt.''
   The PLO entry appears under the abbreviation ``Co.,'' presumably
company, with ``capabilities'' in counter-terrorism and commando
operations, according to the notebook entry. The entry then refers
to a ``head of ops'' and the words ``Betzar'' and ``Yonis.''
   The North and Noriega conversation also touched on what appears
to be an idea for a ``school'' with ``courses for commandos'' and
the desire ``to train experts'' with courses in ``booby traps ...
night ops ... raids,'' apparently for service in ``Afghanistan.''
   Some 1,200 pages of North notebook entries, heavily censored by
the government, were made available Friday by a private research
organization, the National Security Archive.
   President Bush, who was then vice president, has said he did not
know details of the covert sale of arms to Iran until Dec. 20,
1986, and did not know of North's Contra resupply operation while
it was in operation.
   But sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a federal
grand jury was convened Friday to continue the 3{-year-old criminal
investigation of the Iran-Contra affair, with a focus on the
precise roles of Bush and former President Reagan.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked for comment on
Bush's role, said Friday: ``We have nothing to add. This matter has
been thoroughly investigated by congressional committees.''
   A North notebook entry from Nov. 25, 1986, the day the affair
became public, refers to a telephone call to North from
then-national security adviser John M. Poindexter and then states,
``VP call Peres'' _ Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
   The entry adds that the ``Contra connection'' has been
``discovered'' and that it ``wd be best if Israel wd accept that
they were aware that some funds were diverted.''
   It is not known if any phone call between Bush and Peres was
made that day or whether the possibility of making a call was
brought up with Bush.
   But Attorney General Edwin Meese III, in disclosing the
diversion of Iran arms sale profits to the Contra aid effort, put
the responsibility partly on Israel. Meese said Iran arms sale
money went directly from the Israelis into bank accounts held by
the Contras.
   Meese's statements, which he made after interviewing North and
Poindexter, drew immediate complaints from the Israeli government.
   Peres called Meese later that day and said Israel had not paid
anything into any Contra accounts. Peres ``indicated that Israel
... was not going to take the blame for the diversion,'' the
congressional Iran-Contra committees said in their final report in
1987.
   Israel had made three arms deliveries to Iran in 1985 with the
blessing of the Reagan administration and had charged far in excess
of what had been paid the Pentagon to replenish the arms shipped to
Iran.
   The diversion apparently began with the November 1985 shipment
of Hawk anti-aircraft missiles, when unexpended funds wound up in
accounts controlled by arms dealers Richard Secord and Albert Hakim.

<HEAD>Controller Protests FAA Removal For Taking Anti-AIDS Drug</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An air traffic controller says the government
improperly removed him from his job because he started taking an
anti-AIDS drug.
   Ron Wilkinson, who worked at Washington Dulles International
Airport, on Friday accused the Federal Aviation Administration of
discrimination.
   His union, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, has
filed a grievance contending that the presence of the human
immunodeficiency virus, HIV, which causes AIDS or use of the drug
AZT should not disqualify a controller.
   FAA spokesman Bob Buckhorn said the agency has a policy of
giving desk jobs to controllers who take AZT, out of concern that
side effects might compromise their critical task of following
aircraft on radar screens.
   Buckhorn declined to comment on Wilkinson's case, citing federal
privacy laws, but he said the FAA is re-examining medical analysis
of AZT to see whether its policy should be re-evaluated.
   Controllers found to carry the HIV virus but who do not take AZT
can continue to direct air traffic, Buckhorn said.
   Wilkinson, 29, now living in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., said he has
been offered no new assignment and hasn't received any pay since
February. He took several months of leave, some of it donated by
other employees, after FAA doctors voided his medical certificate,
he said.
   ``When you're not sick, what do you do, just sit and do
nothing?'' Wilkinson asked. He said he had no symptoms of AIDS
itself.
   Jim Morin, counsel for the controllers union, said federal
guidelines require that the FAA give Wilkinson ``reasonable
accommodation.''
   ``I think that there is some discrimination because of the
nature of his condition,'' Morin said.
   AIDS is an incurable, fatal disease that attacks the body's
immune system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases
and infections.
   President Bush in March called on business executives not to lay
off or fire people infected with or exposed to the virus. ``They
can serve many more productive years with no threat to you, your
other workers or your companies,'' he said.
   Dr. William Reiter, director of the Center for Special
Immunology in Fort Lauderdale, where Wilkinson is being treated,
said tests of patients on AZT have shown no significant sleepiness,
dizziness or any other problems that might hinder their work as
controllers.
   In some cases, he said, patients given a placebo showed more
side effects than those given AZT. And he said new studies have
failed to find any impact on the nervous system from the presence
of HIV virus.
   AZT, originally known as azidothymidine but now called
zidovudine, is the only drug approved for anti-viral treatment of
AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Wilkinson said he was an Air Force controller for eight years.
He said he worked for the FAA at Dulles, in a Virginia suburb
outside Washington, for 21 months and had expected to qualify as a
top-level controller in about a year.
   Wilkinson was interviewed by telephone after a report on his
case by Washington's WUSA-TV.
   On Friday, WUSA reporter Kent Jarrell interviewed another
controller who said he has ignored a doctor's orders to take AZT
because he doesn't want to lose his job at one of the nation's
busiest air traffic control facilities.
   That controller, whose identity was concealed for the report,
said he knew of several others facing the same dilemma.

   First there was entertainment and news. Then
there were commercials. Now there are infomercials.
   And they lure unsuspecting consumers who can't tell the
difference into spending millions of dollars on ``miracle''
products that don't stand up to their claims, according to
government officials and researchers.
   Consumers last year spent $450 million on questionable products
and services hawked by infomercials _ program-length advertisements
masquerading as objective programming, Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said
Friday.
   ``For millions of Americans watching television, it's getting
harder and harder to distinguish between commercials and talk shows
and news programs,'' Wyden said at a hearing on the programming by
two House Small Business subcommittees.
   Witnesses testified that the shows should be clearly identified
and more closely monitored for substantiation of claims.
   Infomercials are commercials, frequently lasting a half-hour,
which are carried on broadcast and cable television most often
during non-peak and early-morning time slots. They use special
report and talk-show program formats and often include live
audiences, familiar actors as hosts or former government officials
as experts.
   ``One of the essential questions in terms of consumer protection
is whether viewers can identify infomercials as paid advertising,''
said Rader Hayes, an assistant professor of consumer science at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison.
   She showed the panels videotapes of infomercials touting items
ranging from a stun gun as ``a cousin to the Star Trek phaser'' to
a water cleaning system that claimed to aid in weight reduction.
   Hayes said an internationally recognizable symbol should be
adopted and required to be visible on the TV screen during the
entirety of infomercials because ``even I have been fooled.''
   ``It would be immediately evident to viewers ... that they are
watching a paid commercial program,'' she said.
   Harold A. Shoup, vice president of the American Association of
Advertising Agencies, said infomercials were a ``violation of our
standards both in terms of the claims that are made as well as the
format that masks the commercial purpose of the program itself.''
   Shoup said no infomercials cited at Friday's hearing were
created by members of his group.
   Wyden chided government agencies' reluctance to act against the
ads.
   ``The snake oil has been flowing in rivers and the federal
government has been very slow to get to the levee,'' he said.
   The Federal Trade Commission, however, has an active infomercial
monitoring and investigation program, said Barry Cutler, director
of the Bureau of Consumer Protection at the agency.
   ``In the past 18 months, the FTC has taken six public law
enforcement actions involving claims made in program-length ads,''
Cutler testified.
   The commission is concentrating its efforts on major producers
of infomercials and on obtaining consent decrees that cover all of
their programming, not just the individual cases involved in
complaints, Cutler explained.
   None of the hearing participants said new regulations or
legislation were needed to control infomercial advertising.

   Previously, ``I never looked up and saw my name in lights and
felt a warm glow. I never thought, `I'm a movie star. Isn't this
wonderful.' I never experienced any of that because I never allowed

   The Central Electoral
Board agreed Friday to doublecheck vote totals in a tight
presidential race after challenger Juan Bosch accused the board and
incumbent President Joaquin Balaguer of fraud.
   Bosch at the same time withdrew his threat to lead street
demonstrations protesting the vote count, which went into its third
day Friday.
   The electoral review, though not a full recount, is a laborious
process affecting all races and could delay the outcome of
Wednesday's general election by two more days or longer, officials
said.
   Balaguer, a five-time president who is 83 and blind, and Bosch,
80, a former president who was overthrown in a 1963 military coup,
were locked in their fifth race for the presidency of this
Caribbean nation of 7 million people. Balaguer won three of the
four previous races.
   With 88 percent of polling stations reporting, Balaguer led
Bosch by 13,000 votes, according to the Central Electoral Board.
   Balaguer had 579,431 votes and Bosch 566,405 with 5,873 of the
6,663 polling stations reporting, official results showed. Jose
Francisco Pena Gomez, a former socialist mayor of Santo Domingo and
a former Bosch protege, was a distant third with 384,647.
   Former President Jimmy Carter, one of 30 international observers
of the voting, announced the decision to review the vote count at a
news conference Friday.
   ``Any fraud or honest errors will be discovered and resolved,''
said Carter, reading in Spanish from a statement signed jointly by
him and Froilan Tavares, the Central Electoral Board president.
   Carter said all eight presidential candidates approved the
procedure under which copies of tally sheets obtained by political
parties from polling stations will be checked against tallies
received by the electoral board .
   The tally sheets record vote totals in all the elections,
including the 30 Senate, 120 congressional and 103 mayoral races.
   Official results showed Balaguer's Social Christian Reformist
Party retaining control of the Senate, but the outcome of the other
races remained unclear.
   Carter said Bosch called off a street demonstration planned for
Friday and was cooperating with the electoral review.
   ``Neither Professor Bosch nor any of the candidates presented to
me any evidence of fraud,'' Carter said, in answer to questions. He
said there were some complaints about minor errors, ``but I have no
doubt these errors can be corrected.''
   The electoral board announced on television Thursday night that
election law barred public demonstrations while the vote count
continued. The announcement was repeated several times.
   On Friday morning, a scuffle broke out when Bosch arrived at his
Dominican Liberation Party headquarters, where about 200 supporters
had gathered. Reports conflicted as to what happened.
   Party vice president Elfidio Baez said an army intelligence
agent stepped from the crowd and pulled a gun on Bosch as he
stepped from a car, while two other men ``pushed Bosch around.''
Supporters began hitting the agent before security men intervened
and took him away, Baez said. He said the two other men fled.
   An army spokesman confirmed the man involved was an intelligence
agent, but denied the man drew a gun. The spokesman, who insisted
on anonymity, said the agent suffered minor injuries and was taken
to a hospital by police.
   Bosch, who served only seven months as president before being
overthrown in 1963, accused both Balaguer and the Central Electoral
Board of fraud in tabulating votes.
   ``The Central Electoral Board and Dr. Balaguer committed a
colossal fraud,'' he told reporters Thursday, without elaboration.
   About 3.2 million people were registered to vote nationwide.
   Bosch, an author and intellectual who describes himself as a
Marxist but not a Communist, ran on a moderate platform, endorsing
capitalism as the best way to improve his country's economic plight.
   Balaguer, now blind from glaucoma, was first elected president
in 1966 and served three consecutive four-year terms before losing
in 1978. He was re-elected in 1986.
   Balaguer has presided over a $2 billion public-works project to
transform Santo Domingo. The project has created thousands of jobs,
but the country's economic crisis has worsened.

   Federal health officials want to use a new
testing program to make experimental drugs available more quickly
to people infected with the AIDS virus.
   Under the proposal announced Friday, a promising experimental
drug that has been shown to be safe could be made available to
patients who have no treatment alternative.
   ``We are proposing this initiative because of its potential for
prolonging lives,'' said Dr. James Mason, assistant secretary for
health in the Department of Health and Human Services.
   Patients with no treatment alternatives would be getting the
drugs at the same time as patients who are participating in the
second phase of clinical trials. In this phase, drugs found to be
safe are tested for efficacy.
   Officials cautioned that the plan, called ``parallel track,''
would not replace or substitute for conventional drug-testing
trials, which are required for marketing approval by the Food and
Drug Administration.
   ``We believe we have built sufficient safeguards into parallel
track to ensure that it neither compromises the drug approval and
clinical trials process nor delays the speedy delivery of promising
investigational agents from the laboratory to the bedside,'' Mason
said.
   Officials said they did not know which drug would be the first
to be put on the parallel track.
   The plan is not intended to decrease the time in which a drug
gets marketing approval from the FDA, officials said.
   This process usually takes years, with the average being about
4.2 years for life-prolonging and life-saving drugs, FDA officials
have said.
   The plan is similar to the expanded access system that was set
up for the anti-AIDS drug DDI, or dideoxyinosine, which is being
compared in clinical trials with AZT, the only approved drug that
fights the AIDS virus directly.
   However, under the DDI plan, patients who were not in the
clinical trials were getting the drug faster than the patients
participating in the controlled trials because of the time it takes
to set up such testing.
   ``With parallel track, that wouldn't happen,'' said James Allen,
director of the National AIDS Program Office. ``Clinical trials
would need to be under way or at least starting at the time the
drug would be made available'' for the wider distribution.
   The parallel track idea was initiated last summer.
   The Public Health Service, which includes the National
Institutes of Health and the FDA, is proposing that it be used at
first only for people with AIDS or those infected with the human
immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS.
   But health officials said they will consider expanding the plan
to make experimental drugs for other life-threatening diseases
available to patients earlier.
   The proposal is to be published in the Federal Register on
Monday. The Public Health Service will accept public comments on
the proposal for the next 60 days, after which it can publish a
final rule.

   An army patrol killed 14 Maoist rebels
in a battle in Peru's coca-producing Upper Huallaga valley, army
officials say.
   The fight took place Thursday afternoon near the village of
Morona, 20 miles north of Tingo Maria. One army officer was
wounded, according to the report.
   The fight began when a column of Shining Path guerrillas
ambushed an army patrol that was returning to its base in Tingo
Maria, 200 miles northeast of Lima, officials said Friday.
   Tingo Maria is the largest city in the Upper Huallaga valley,
where most of Peru's illegal coca crop is grown. The coca leaf is
used in making cocaine.
   The Shining Path gets money from drug traffickers who buy the
coca leaf from area farmers. Peru is the world's largest coca
producer.
   The guerrilla group launched its armed insurgency in the
southern highlands 10 years ago.
   One faction operating in the Ayacucho region, 235 miles
southeast of Lima, announced Thursday it was temporarily halting
attacks to ``evaluate'' its strategy. However, the announcement
appeared to come from a small splinter group as rebel attacks have
continued.
   The government says more than 18,000 people, mostly civilians,
have died in the decade of violence.

   Death penalty opponents ended a 400-mile,
two-week march with a meeting with the daughter of Martin Luther
King Jr., who called for an end to ``legalized murder.''
   ``I believe the death penalty is un-Christian, un-American and
unconstitutional,'' Bernice King said at Ebenezer Baptist Church on
Friday. She called on politicians to support stricter gun control
measures and film makers to cease the ``endless glorification of
violence'' in today's movies.
   ``Let us send a message from Atlanta that we are today united
and determined to put an end to legalized murder,'' Ms. King said.
   About 150 death penalty opponents were to participate today in
laying a wreath on King's tomb.A core group of about 30 people made
the entire journey to Atlanta from Starke, Fla. They left May 4.
   ``The death penalty is just the use of violence in a very
selective way,'' said Sister Helen Prejean, the Louisiana nun who
organized the pilgrimage. ``It is an act of despair (because)
anti-crime problems are really much more complex than just
executing a few people each year.''
   Sister Prejean had served as a spiritual adviser to Dalton
Prejean, who early Friday in Louisiana became the 128th prisoner
put to death since executions resumed in the United States in 1977.
Helen and Dalton Prejean were not related.
   The death penalty opponents marched into the Atlanta business
district Friday carrying 37 black-draped, coffin-shaped boxes
intended to represent states that have the death penalty on the
books, and 13 green plants for states where it is illegal.
   The pilgrimage was sponsored by Amnesty International, the
American Friends Service Committee and the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference.

   So many grief-stricken fans showed up to
say a last farewell to Sammy Davis Jr. that they had to be moved
through the cemetery in shifts.
   The 64-year-old song-and-dance man known as ``Mr.
Entertainment'' was buried Friday next to his vaudeville
entertainer father in a family plot. The fans, many in tears,
silently filed by the fresh, flower-laden grave.
   In Las Vegas, hoteliers darkened their marquees for 10 minutes
Friday night in honor of the entertainer's memory.
   About 1,200 people had filled the Hall of Liberty at Forest Lawn
Memorial Park in the Hollywood Hills, while hundreds more cheered
Davis' recording of ``I've Got to be Me'' played during the
90-minute funeral service.
   ``He has answered the curtain call over and over and over again,
and now we want an encore,'' the Rev. Jesse Jackson said in a
eulogy. ``Encore, encore no more. Let him rest. Let Mr. Bojangles
rest. He has earned it.''
   Jackson said Davis had forged new attitudes about blacks in
America.
   ``The world of segregation had to stop ... to let him get on and
change the world,'' said the civil rights leader.
   Davis died Wednesday from throat cancer at age 64. He
entertained millions during a career that began in vaudevlle at age
1{ and eventually encompassed almost every form of entertainment.
   Sympathy messages and flowers flooded in from all over the world.
   After Friday's service, hundreds of cars formed a motorcade to
the cemetery a few miles away. Traffic jammed on two freeways,
while scores of people watched the motorcade from sidewalks.
   In a walled courtyard named the Gardens of Honor, Davis rested
next to his entertainer father, Sammy Davis.
   Hundreds of fans waited for hours in the hot sun to view the
Davis grave site and could be accommodated only in shifts.
   Dancer Gregory Hines tearfully recalled being inspired as a
10-year-old while seeing Davis perform in 1956 at the Apollo
Theater in Harlem.
   He recounted how during a recent visit, the entertainer, unable
to speak, mimed the action of throwing a ball to him. ``I hope I
have the courage to carry that ball,'' Hines said.
   Outside the funeral, a fan had sculpted the words ``Luv you
Sammy'' in his hair.
   ``How lucky we all were to have Sammy in our lives and how
dearly I will miss him,'' Davis' widow, Altovise, told the
gathering as her voice broke.
   The host of celebrity mourners included Frank Sinatra, Dean
Martin, Liza Minnelli, Shirley MacLaine and Wayne Newton.
   Stevie Wonder, Angie Dickinson, Gladys Knight, Roddy McDowell,
Dennis Hopper, Robert Culp, Carroll O'Connor, Ben Vereen, Billy
Crystal, Tony Danza, Robert Wagner, Jill St. John, Ricardo
Montalban and Burt Reynolds also came.

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Hosni Mubarak has completed a
six-year process of reconciliation with the Soviet Union without
damaging Egypt's special relationship with the United States.
   Mubarak returned home with political and economic benefits for
Egypt after a 46-hour visit to Moscow this week, the first by an
Egyptian head of state in 18 years.
   He won Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's public support for
his Middle East policies. It included Gorbachev's strong
condemnation of Israel for allowing Soviet Jewish immigrants to
settle on occupied Arab territories.
   The two nations also signed an agreement that holds the promise
of substantial Soviet economic aid for Egypt during the 1990s.
   Perhaps more importantly, the improvement in Cairo-Moscow
relations has not come at Washington's expense.
   There was no hint during Mubarak's visit of any Soviet intent to
revive the Kremlin's old role as Egypt's principal arms supplier, a
function that the United States assumed in 1980. Nor was there any
suggestion of Moscow trying to join the United States in current
Middle East peacemaking efforts.
   Rather, Mubarak came away with a Soviet pledge to support U.S.
and Egyptian efforts to initiate a Palestinian-Israeli dialogue in
Cairo. Previously, Moscow's policy focused solely on the
Israeli-spurned idea of an international Middle East peace
conference.
   Mubarak's visit came six years after he initiated a policy of
trying to normalize relations with the Soviet Union, where as a
young air force officer he trained to be a fighter pilot.
   He began by restoring diplomatic representation to the level of
ambassador. Later, he mended other fences smashed by his
predecessor, Anwar Sadat.
   Sadat, assassinated by Moslem extremists almost nine years ago,
was the last Egyptian head of state to visit Moscow, in 1972 just
before relations soured. First the Soviets refused to meet Egypt's
arms requests. Sadat reacted with sweeping reprisals including
expelling 17,000 Soviet military personnel.
   Despite the improvement in relations since 1984, there remained
what one Egyptian official termed ``a psychological shortcoming in
terms of the absence of personal, face-to-face contact at the top.''
   Mubarak's visit to Moscow from Monday to Wednesday sealed that
breach.
   Ibrahim Nafei, editor of Cairo's leading newspaper Al-Ahram and
a member of Mubarak's entourage, wrote that the meeting ``rectified
the balance of relations and put them in the proper context.''
   ``More accurately, it codified the relationship ... on the
footing of close personal knowledge between the two leaders that
had been missing.''
   The visit was part of an Asian-European tour that also took
Mubarak to China, North Korea, Oman and Britain.
   Before setting out, Mubarak made clear his objectives included
seeking economic benefits and marshaling opposition to the settling
of Soviet Jewish immigrants in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   He evidently succeeded.
   In a Moscow dinner speech honoring Mubarak, Gorbachev denounced
settling Jewish immigrants among the 1.7 million Palestinians
living in the West Bank and Gaza as ``anti-Soviet.'' It is part of
``insidious designs'' by Israel, he said.
   ``To push emigrants to Israel into doing that amounts to
dangerously and immorally playing with their fates,'' Gorbachev
said.
   It was Moscow's strongest censure of Israel since the influx of
Soviet Jews began last fall. Israel captured the West Bank from
Jordan and Gaza from Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Officials in Cairo said the Soviets promised to consider
Egyptian ideas on the emigration issue. One would grant Soviet Jews
the right to return if they find difficulties in Israel after
emigrating. Another would ask the United States to relax
restrictions on Soviet Jewish immigration.
   Hundreds of thousands of Soviet Jews are expected to emigrate to
Israel in the next few years as the result of a relaxation of
travel regulations in the Soviet Union and a tighter entry quota in
the United States.
   Israel says it has no policy of settling the new arrivals in the
occupied territories.
   Gorbachev and Mubarak also signed a joint declaration that
reflected an apparent shift by Moscow on Middle East peacemaking.
   The joint declaration clearly gave precedence to U.S.-brokered
peace talks over an international conference aimed at reaching an
overall Middle East settlement.
   The two countries signed a 10-year agreement that sets
guidelines for economic, commercial, scientific and technological
cooperation.
   Under the accord, Egyptian officials anticipate receiving Soviet
economic aid amounting to $700 million to $800 million. They said
this would include expansion of Egypt's steel and aluminum
industries, originally built with Soviet help, and construction of
new power stations.

<HEAD>Sandinistas Criticize Suspension of Contra Disarmament</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RODOLFO GARCIA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   MANAGUA, Nicaragua _ A decision by the Contra guerrillas to stop
disarming has drawn energetic criticism from spokesmen for both the
Sandinista opposition and President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro's
government.
   The announcement Friday came despite an earlier agreement to
disarm, one of the key elements of the transition from President
Daniel Ortega's Sandinista government to Mrs. Chamorro, who was
inaugurated April 25.
   Alfredo Cesar, one of Mrs. Chamorro's closest advisers, said the
Contras should understand that the nation's stability depends on
the disarmament, the demobilization and the full integration of the
rebels into civil life.''
   The Contras had agreed to disarm by June 10, but the process was
going slowly, with only 1,000 of about 11,000 fighters putting down
their weapons as of Thursday.
   In a communique signed by chief of staff Israel Galeano, the
Contras announced they were suspending the disarmament process
indefinitely because of an ``atmosphere of uncertainty and social
instability.''
   Galeano was referring to strikes by government workers that
paralyzed Mrs. Chamorro's government earlier this week.
   He also asserted the Contras were not receiving promised medical
assistance and food; some Sandinista troops were still in security
zones where the rebels have concentrated, and demobilized Contras
were being harassed when they returned home.
   Galeano also called for a meeting to review the accords, a call
that drew an angry reaction from the Sandinistas.
   ``We think that these accords should be carried out, exactly as
they were signed,'' said Sergio Ramirez, leader of the Sandinista
delegation to the National Assembly.
   The Contra announcement came as the National Assembly was
debating a series of laws designed to reverse laws passed by the
lame-duck Sandinista assembly between the Feb. 25 election and the
inauguration.
   Mrs. Chamorro had attempted to suspend some of the laws by
presidential decree but gave up when government workers staged
sit-down strikes.
   Laws to reform the civil service and national labor laws were
passed by 48-2 and 47-0 respectively; the 39 Sandinista
representatives abstained, saying the laws were unconstitutional.
   A controversial law on university autonomy was withdrawn at the
last moment at Mrs. Chamorro's request, drawing applause from both
sides in the assembly.
   Mrs. Chamorro said she was setting up a special commission
including Sandinista university leaders to study changes in the
law, which grants the universities self-government.
   Mrs. Chamorro's coalition charges that the Sandinistas are
trying to entrench themselves in the universities, while the
Sandinistas say the government is trying to destroy university
independence.
   Several hundred students, many of whom feared government budget
cuts would increase the cost of education, demonstrated against the
measure outside the assembly throughout the day.
   The basic disarmament agreement was signed by representatives of
the Contras and Mrs. Chamorro's transition team March 23;
subsequent agreements signed during April and May set the
disarmament to begin May 8 and end June 10.
   Ramirez, who was vice president during the Sandinista
administration, stressed Friday that there could be no changes in
the accords ``because to do so would be to renew uncertainty and
open the perspective of more pain, more death, more blood.''
   Cesar, a former civilian Contra leader who now is also first
secretary of the assembly, said the government and U.N. observers
would have to hold an urgent meeting on the Contra decision.
   Representatives of the U.N. group that is overseeing the
disarmament process have said privately that they do not expect
that the process can be completed by June 10.
   Luis Sanchez, the assembly's first vice president, said he
wasn't surprised by the Sandinista-led strikes or the Contra
decision.
   ``This is a result of the terrible damage done by 10 years of
war to the national conscience,'' said Sanchez. ``Nobody trusts
anybody.''

<HEAD>Cosmonauts Awaiting Ladder to Repair Space Ship</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two cosmonauts aboard the Soviet space station
Mir are awaiting delivery of a ladder so they can repair the space
ship that would speed them back to Earth in case of an emergency.
   The ladder is to be carried aloft aboard an unmanned resupply
craft that is scheduled for launch on June 1, the magazine Aviation
Week and Space Technology says in its May 21 issue.
   The Soviets had disclosed previously that the Soyuz TM-9
spacecraft was damaged, apparently when it was launched Feb. 11 en
route to the Mir with cosmonauts Anatoli Solovyev and Aleksandr
Balandin. Three of the ship's eight thermal blankets came loose.
   ``This is a situation which generally requires attention, of
course, but it probably is not all that serious,'' one of the
cosmonauts said in a three-minute excerpt carried on Soviet radio
on March 9. He said he and his companion were prepared for a space
walk.
   The Soviets use small Soyuz capsules to transport cosmonauts to
and from the space station. Sometimes the crews will ride their own
Soyuz back to Earth, at other times a crew that has been aboard the
Mir will travel in a Soyuz brought by other cosmonauts. The space
station has several docking ports.
   Aviation Week interviewed cosmonaut Alexander A. Serebrov, who
recently returned from the Mir, where he photographe the damaged
Soyuz TM-9 vehicle from his own TM-8 spacecraft.
   The pictures show large thermal blankets on the outside of the
TM-9 have been ripped out of place. The magazine said they are
blocking key sensors needed to align the spacecraft properly for
re-entry to Earth's atmosphere.
   In addition, the vehicle's metal skin has been exposed to space,
degrading its ability to control temperature inside.
   ``The Soyuz has become cold, causing a buildup of water
condensation in the vehicle,'' Aviation Week said. It quoted
Serebrov as saying engineers are concerned that the condensation
could cause an electrical malfunction during re-entry.
   Some repair materials were aboard an unmanned resupply vehicle,
Progress 42, which docked with Mir on May 8. The ladder is expected
to arrive aboard an unmanned Kristall module.

   The Hubble Space Telescope is finally ready to
send its first picture from space.
   Unless something unexpected interferes, the picture will be
taken Sunday morning and sent to the Goddard Space Flight Center in
Maryland in the afternoon. The National Aeronautics and Space
Administration was to announce the exact time today.
   The image won't be much better than a similar view taken with
far less-expensive telescopes from Earth.
   ``We will probably learn nothing of any scientific value because
the telescope won't be performing anywhere near its eventual
value,'' NASA's Hubble project scientist, Ed Weiler, said Friday.
``This not a science image, just an engineering picture.''
   The first picture will be of an open star cluster called Theta
Carina in the southern constellation Carina, a Latin word that
means Ship's Keel. The cluster is 3 billion years old, 1,260 light
years from Earth and 21 light years across. Its astronomical
designation is NGC3532.
   The wide field planetary camera, one of five scientific
instruments on the telescope, will store the picture Sunday morning
on an onboard recorder. Later the image will be transmitted to the
ground through a relay satellite and run through a computer to
remove background noise.
   ``We're all kind of excited, all looking forward to getting
first light out of our way,'' Weiler said.

   Fourteen-year-old Brian Jenkins of Malvern,
Ark., found it hard to believe he was in last place of the closing
round of the National MATHCOUNTS finals, but he wasn't daunted by
the odds.
   Jenkins won the only national mathematics competition for junior
high school students Friday by first beating Robert Shih of Palos
Verdes Estates, Calif., who had tied him for ninth place.
   The eighth grader outfigured the other eight opponents in
rapid-fire fashion, including the three who had made perfect scores
in the written round of the contest.
   To top first place-contestant Matthew Crawford, 12, of
Birmingham, Ala., Jenkins gave the correct response of 10 when
asked how many combinations of wins and losses are possible if a
team is to win a series of basketball games, and if the series is
won when one team wins three out of five games.
   With that answer, Jenkins won an $8,000 scholarship, a gold
medal, a personal computer and a week at U.S. Space Camp in
Huntsville, Ala.
   ``I thought I had a pretty good chance'' of winning, Jenkins
said, explaining his attitude as he entered the ballroom of the
Washington hotel.
   ``But when you said I tied for ninth place, I found that hard to
believe,'' he told a program official. ``But as I got going, I
thought I had a pretty good chance.''
   Jenkins correctly answered 22 of the tough math questions and
acknowledged he had to actually calculate seven or eight of the
problems.
   Runner-up Crawford took home a silver medal and a $6,000
scholarship, while third-place finisher Daniel Schepler, 14, of
Beavercreek, Ohio, was awarded a bronze medal and $4,000
scholarship. Each won a week at the space camp.
   For the first time since the program began in 1983, the
fast-paced Countdown Round that resembles a game show started with
three students getting perfect scores on the written portion of the
competition.
   Crawford, Schepler and Ravi Shanmugam, 12 of Lawrence, Kan., had
to draw straws to determine who would enter the final round in
first, second or third place. Program officials agreed to award
each youngster with the $2,000 top written competition prize and an
additional award for the third-place scholarship.
   The winning team was from Ohio. The second-place team was from
California, followed by Illinois, Virginia, Wisconsin,
Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Iowa, Alabama and Florida.
   Based on individual scores in the written semifinals, 10
students qualify for a chance at the national championship.

<HEAD>VA to Pay Vietnam Veterans for Soft Tissue Sarcoma</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Veterans Administration has decided to
allow disability payments to Vietnam veterans with soft-tissue
sarcoma, a rare form of cancer linked to Agent Orange exposure.
   Veterans Secretary Edward J. Derwinski announced the action
Friday, the second time this year the VA has decided to award
compensation for cancers linked to exposure to the
dioxin-contaminated herbicide that was sprayed in undiluted form
during the Vietnam War.
   On March 29, Derwinski announced that veterans suffering from
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma would be eligible for compensation.
   Friday's decision was based on the recommendations made by the
VA's Veterans Advisory Committee on Environmental Hazards, a panel
of outside scientists and lay people. It found Thursday that there
is ``at least as likely as not'' a significant statistical
association between the disease and exposure to Agent Orange.
   The ruling in March was based on a study by the Centers for
Disease Control study of selected cancers. Researchers found a 50
percent increased risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma among Vietnam
veterans, but the study looked only indirectly at whether Agent
Orange was the cause.
   The CDC study found no such increased risk for soft-tissue
sarcoma. But the advisory committee's examination of other
scientific literature relating to herbicide and dioxin exposure
tilted the balance in favor of compensation.
   ``I believe this is another step forward in resolving a most
difficult and emotional issue,'' Derwinski said. ``We intend to
proceed as quickly as possible to award compensation to these
veterans who are so deserving of our care and concern.''
   For years, Veterans have been seeking compensation for diseases
they say were caused by Agent Orange, a combination of two phenoxy
herbicides, one of which was contaminated with the byproduct dioxin.
   As many as 28 health problems, mostly cancers, can be associated
with exposure, according to Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr., a special
adviser to Derwinski.
   VA plans to publish its final compensation regulation for
soft-tissue sarcomas in early fall. An estimated 1,100 veterans or
their survivors are expected to receive compensation for
soft-tissue sarcomas to start with. An additional 50 claims
annually are expected thereafter, given the long latency period for
cancer.
   Soft-tissue sarcomas are a group of malignant tumors found on
muscles and connective tissue or in body fat.

<HEAD>Congress Told Sanctions Should Be Left To President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush should be allowed to decide
whether to punish nations that use chemical or biological weapons
in violation of international law, the State Department argues.
   Deputy spokesman Richard Boucher called on congressional
negotiators Friday to reject a bill _ approved 92-0 by the Senate
on Thursday _ requiring the president to impose sanctions in all
such cases.
   If the bill is passed in its Senate form, Administration
officials say they will recommend that Bush veto it. They say it
would restrict the president's constitutional responsibility to
conduct foreign policy.
   ``The administration believes that flexible and non-mandatory
sanctions legislation can play a useful role in support of our
policy objectives,'' Boucher said.
   He said the Bush administration supports a bill passed earlier
by the House, which he said enables the president ``to target
sanctions for maximum effectiveness, taking into account the entire
range of our foreign and national security policy interests.''
   Boucher said Bush has taken the lead in seeking a global
chemical weapons ban and noted that talks are underway with the
Soviet Union on a range of weapons issues, including a possible
agreement to reduce chemical weapons stocks in anticipation of a
global ban.
   But lawmakers said they are concerned about the spread of the
weapons among Third World countries.
   ``It's clear that the inhibition against the use of chemical
weapons is slipping,'' said Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman
of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   The legislation was prompted by the use of chemical weapons in
the Iran-Iraq war, Iraq's reported use of the weapons last year
against its Kurdish minority, and Iraq's recent threat to use
chemical weapons against Israel.
   The bill declares that as many as 20 nations are capable of
producing chemical weapons and that by the year 2000 at least 15
developing countries will have the ability to produce ballistic
missiles capable of delivering such weapons to their targets.
   The Senate sanctions require a cutoff of arms sales, an embargo
on imports from violating countries, an end to credit guarantees
from the U.S. Export-Import Bank, a halt to financial assistance
from U.S. banks and an end to U.S. military and economic assistance.
   They would apply to governments and also to foreign companies
that help them produce chemical and biological weapons.

   A fortified tunnel under the U.S-Mexico
border _ and the noses of U.S. Customs agents _ allowed drug
dealers to smuggle at least a ton of cocaine into the United States
while smuggling profits out.
   U.S. authorities and Mexican Judicial Police Thursday night
jointly raided the tunnel connecting a warehouse on the American
side of the border and a single-family home 200 feet south in Agua
Prieta, Mexico.
   Thomas McDermott, in charge of the U.S. Customs Service in
Arizona, described the concrete-lined tunnel dubbed ``Cocaine
Alley'' as ``the most unique smuggling operation I have ever come
across.''
   ``A tremendous amount of engineering went into it,'' he said.
   ``It was like something out of a James Bond movie,'' Customs
spokeswoman Judy Turner said Friday.
   A hydraulically lifted concrete slab covered the entrance on the
Mexican side, with a pool table covering the slab.
   Both the warehouse and home were owned by Rafael Francisco
Camarena, 33, of Mexico. McDermott declined to say whether there
was a warrant for Camarena's arrest, but said two other men were
arrested near Phoenix on May 11.
   About 25 or 30 pounds of marijuana was found in the Mexican part
of the tunnel, he said.
   The tunnel was estimated to have cost at least $1 million and
was within one block of an unmarked Customs enforcement building
and four blocks from the international port of entry.
   McDermott said he had no estimate of how much cocaine had been
smuggled through the tunnel.
   The proximity to American authorities indicated the
sophistication of drug smugglers and the measures such groups will
take to move dope into the United States, McDermott said.
   There had been speculation for years that tunnels were being
used, but ``they weren't talking about this type of tunnel,'' he
said. The tunnel ``really shows what the profit motive is. It's not
just cocaine coming in, it's the profits probably going back.
   ``It's a helluva way to get cash out of a country.''
   Turner said, ``It was something that you and I in the ordinary
world would only find in the movies.''
   The raid followed months of investigation and the seizure May 11
of 2,258 pounds of cocaine near Phoenix that was traced to the
warehouse.
   Caesar T. Howard, 44, of Mesa, and Joseph E. Osborn, 31, of
Tempe, were arrested with the cocaine valued at $102 million,
authorities said.
   The warehouse, a metal prefabricated building about 40 by 120
feet, is about 8 months old. The house, which McDermott described
as ``very nice,'' was built about the same time, he said.
   The Mexican entrance was hidden by a concrete slab about 8 by 12
feet covered by a pool table. A spigot in the home's yard was
actually an adjustment valve that hoisted the pool table and
concrete slab.
   A 5-foot-long steel grate in the warehouse floor resembling a
drain disguised the American exit. Underneath was a 7-foot-high
concrete-block room about 10 by 8 feet that was used for storage,
McDermott said.
   A cement-lined shaft with a pulley system led from the room to
the 5-feet- diameter tunnel equipped with a cart for the smugglers
to ferry cocaine, he said.
   The tunnel dips to 40 feet on the Mexican side, an FBI agent
said, and McDermott said it passes below a drainage ditch between
the countries that is at least 10 feet below ground.
   McDermott said the investigation was continuing and that when a
new smuggling method is discovered, ``We are certainly gonna spread
the word and look in other places that this may be employed.''

<TEXT>
   An AIDS-infected inmate convicted of biting
a sheriff's officer was sentenced to 25 years in prison despite
appeals from civil rights groups who said the sentence grew out of
hysteria over the disease.
   Superior Court Judge John B. Mariano on Friday said Gregory D.
Smith, 26, would serve at least 12{ years before becoming eligible
for parole.
   Smith was convicted April 11 of attempted murder, four counts of
aggravated assault and one count of making terroristic threats for
biting sheriff's Officer Albert Waddington, 26.
   Mariano said it wasn't important that experts think it doubtful
AIDS can be spread through biting or spitting. What counts is what
Smith believed when he bit Waddington, Mariano said. Waddington has
not tested positive for AIDS.
   ``The weapon of choice was not his fist, but rather his teeth
and saliva,'' Mariano said. ``His only purpose was to give the
guard a slow and agonizing death, which evidences the depravity of
his actions.''
   Tears rolled down Smith's face as he stood handcuffed after the
sentencing.
   ``You are more or less sentencing me to life because you'll be
taking my life away from me,'' he said. ``I never bit that officer
and I'll say that until the day I die.''
   During the trial, Waddington said Smith bit him three times on
the hand, spat on him and said, ``Now die, you pig. Die from what I
have.'' The episode occurred when Smith was being taken to a
hospital for a checkup from the prison where he is serving a
five-year robbery sentence.
   Mariano said he had received scores of letters asking for
leniency from prisoner and AIDS advocacy groups.
   After Mariano imposed the sentence, about 20 protesters stood
and began chanting: ``Shame! Shame! Shame on you, judge!''
   ``The message was exactly the one we wanted to prevent: one of
continuing the fear and hysteria about AIDS,'' said Judy Greenspan,
a monitor of AIDS-related cases for the American Civil Liberties
Union's National Prison Project.
   ``He was not sentenced because he bit anybody. He was not
sentenced because he commited a crime,'' Ms. Greenspan said. ``He
was sentenced because he's HIV positive.''
   Smith is one of about 10 people in the country charged with
attempting to spread the virus through biting or spitting. In
Texas, Curtis Weeks, 28, was sentenced to life in prison in
November for spitting on a prison guard and announcing he wanted to
``take someone out'' with him.

<HEAD>Agency Says Farmers Taking Less Land from Production</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department says farmers are
taking about 20 percent less cropland from production in 1990 than
they did last year under government acreage programs.
   Under this year's commodity programs, farmers will idle 24.8
million acres, compared with 30.9 million taken from production
under the 1989 programs, according to a preliminary figures
released Friday.
   Most of the reduction in idled land signed up in the 1990
program is in wheat and feed grains acreage. Sharp production
increases have been projected by USDA for those commodities this
year.
   To be eligible for federal price support and related benefits,
farmers are required to take a percentage of their base acres from
crop production and put the land in conservation uses that help
protect the soil.

<HEAD>Pentagon Orders Danger Pay For Personnel In Philippine</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. military and Defense Department civilian
personnel in the Philippines will be getting special danger pay.
   The decision to declare the Philippines an area of imminent
danger for special pay purposes followed the shooting last Sunday
of two U.S. airmen near Clark Air Base, apparently by Communist
guerrillas.
   The step has been taken, the Pentagon said Friday, ``because of
the current unstable conditions'' in the Philippines.
   The designation also affects State Department personnel working
in the country.
   The imminent danger pay amounts to a 15 percent increase in the
basic salary for civilian employees and $110 per month for all
military personnel, the statement said.
   There are 14,745 military personnel and 1,355 Defense Department
civilian workers in the country, the Pentagon said.

<HEAD>Nunn, Glenn Ask GAO To Examine Treatment Of Women At Naval Academy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam
Nunn and Sen. John Glenn want an independent probe of the way the
U.S. Naval Academy reacted when midshipmen handcuffed a female
student to a urinal.
   The General Accounting Office already is reviewing how well the
service academies are being managed. The two senators asked
Comptroller General Charles Bowsher, who heads the GAO, to expand
that investigation.
   The senators said they were concerned about the Naval Academy's
response to the hazing incident as well as ``irregularities in the
processing of ... certain disciplinary cases'' and a break-in at
the engineering department and possible theft of final examinations.
   ``Together, these incidents suggest the possibility of problems
at the Naval Academy and insensitivity by its leadership with
regard to academic integrity, the overall treatment of women and
fairness in disciplinary proceedings,'' wrote Nunn, D-Ga., and
Glenn, D-Ohio.
   Glenn, chairman of the Armed Services Subcommittee on Manpower
and Personnel, released the letter Friday.
   Gwen Dreyer, 19, recently resigned from the academy, saying she
was frustrated by the way officials handled the investigation of
her complaint that two male midshipmen handcuffed her to a urinal
and taunted her as others snapped pictures.
   Rear Adm. Virgil L. Hill Jr., superintendent of the academy at
Annapolis, Md., already has ordered special inquiries into the
widely publicized incident.
   After an academy hearing, two midshipmen received one-month
campus restrictions and demerits on their records after an academy
hearing. Six others received written warnings.
   About 10 percent of the academy's 4,334 students are women.

<TEXT>
   Here is a look at Romania's national
election to be held Sunday.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   AT STAKE _ The presidency and 506 seats in the bicameral
parliament, or Constituent Assembly. There are 119 seats in the
Senate and 387 in the Assembly of Deputies. An additional 15 seats
are given to officially recognized minorities.
   Deputies' main task will be to adopt a new constitution. New
elections must be held a year after the constitution is approved.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   VOTING _ Romanians 18 years and older are eligible to vote. That
accounts fo almost 17 million of Romania's 23 million people.
   Elections in the 41 constituent districts are valid only if a
majority of eligible voters cast ballots. If turnout is too low,
runoffs will be held within two weeks. In the second round of
voting, no minimum number of voters is required.
   If no candidate wins a majority in the presidential race, a
runoff will be held June 3 between the top two vote-getters.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SUPERVISION _ About 1,000 foreign observers are expected in
Romania, including delegations from the Vienna-based International
Helsinki Human Rights Federation, the Strasbourg-based Council of
Europe and the U.S.-based National Democratic Institute for
International Affairs.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   MAIN PARTIES _ Only six of 82 parties running are expected to
gain seats. These are:
   _National Salvation Front, which has dominated politics since
the December overthrow of Nicolae Ceausescu. It claims 1 million
members and urges cautious moves to a free-market system. Polls
predict it will win a majority in parliament.
   _National Liberal Party, which claims 600,000 members, gets most
support from urban youth and intellectuals. It advocates rapid
privatization and foreign investment.
   _National Peasants Party, which claims 800,000 members. Most
support comes from rural areas.
   The three other smaller parties are the Ecology Party, the
Democratic Agrarian Party and the center-left Social Democratic
Party.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES _ Ion Iliescu, interim president, is the
leader of the National Salvation Front and heavily favored to win.
He is a 60-year-old former Communist minister demoted by Ceausescu
after challenging him in 1971.
   Radu Campeanu, 66, leads the National Liberals. Campeanu was
imprisoned in the 1950s and lived in exile in France from 1973
until after the December revolution. Polls indicate he could win 13
percent of the vote.
   Ion Ratiu, 72, coms from the Peasants Party. He left Romania in
1940 and became a millionaire in Britain, then returned after the
revolution. Polls give him 6-7 percent of the vote.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ISSUES _ How quickly to move from a Communist command economy to
Western-style capitalism, and from authoritarian rule to more
genuine democracy. Job security is a prime issue, with many
worrying about mass unemployment if subsidies are cut and firms
privatized.
   National minorities _ especially the 2 million Hungarians who
complain of discrimination _ are another, highly emotional issue.

<HEAD>Washington Will Give Laos Money for Artificial Limbs,
Rehabilitation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. government has agreed to give
$850,000 to Laos to buy artificial limbs and rehabilitation devices
in 1990-1991, the official Laotian news agency KPL reported.
   The report said it was the second project funded by the U.S.
Agency for International Development ``since the thaw of the two
countries' diplomatic relations.'' The first project, for rural
development in the northeastern province of Houa Phanh, began late
last year.
   The KPL report Friday was seen in Bangkok today.
   It said a memorandum on the new agreement was signed Thursday in
the capital, Vientiane, by Laotian Foreign Minister Soubanh
Sritthirath and by Richard Solomon, the U.S. assistant secretary of
state for Asian affairs. Solomon visited Laos as part of a regional
tour.
   U.S. relations with Laos have improved since the Communist
government there agreed in 1987 to accelerate cooperation in the
search for the remains of American servicemen reported missing in
action from the Vietnam War.
   A U.S. military team is in Laos to excavate two warplane crash
sites that previous investigations have indicated may yield remains
of missing airmen. They are the fourth and fifth joint excavations
with Laotians experts this year.
   American officials said last year that relations soon may be
upgraded to the ambassadorial level. Each country is now
represented by charges d'affaires.
   The aid for Houa Phanh marked the first time since the
Communists came to power in 1975 that the United States has
directly funded a development project in Laos. It is part of an
effort to eradicate the cultivation of illicit narcotics.
   The KPL report did not say who would receive the artificial
limbs and rehabilitation aid. Many Laotians were maimed after the
Vietnam War spilled over into Laos. Since the war ended in 1975,
many others have lost limbs after they accidently triggered
unexploded bombs dropped by the Americans.

   Cheers and tears of joy greeted the
announcement by Mills College that it was reversing a decision two
weeks to admit undergraduate men to the elite liberal arts school.
   Trustees agreed Friday to keep men out of classes at the
138-year-old college after alumnae put together an alternative
financial rescue plan. They had been forced to do so by students,
who held a two-week strike that closed down the school.
   ``Women who are taught to strive for equality and justice have a
power that can never be crushed,'' said Melissa Stevenson-Dile,
incoming student body president. ``On this day, May 18, 1990, the
women of Mills College have proved we are worthy of our education.''
   The board wanted to admit undergraduate men in fall 1991 to
boost enrollment from its current 777 to 1,000 and help balance
Mills' $24 million annual budget. Yearly tuition at the school is
almost $12,000.
   ``All of you have had a lot of banners for us all week. Here's
one for you,'' board chairman Warren Hellman told a crowd of about
300 women as he unfurled a banner that read, ``Mills _ For Women.
Again.''
   ``Sometimes in your lifetime you are involved in something that
may not just change an institution, it may change the world. I
think you've done it,'' he said.
   Graduation ceremonies will be held as planned Sunday, but
students won't get their diplomas until this summer because records
couldn't be verified in time to issue the documents.
   College President Mary Metz stopped short of giving the student
protesters full credit for the reversal and warned that if the
school runs into serious financial trouble administrators will
again consider admitting men.
   ``The civil disobedience was very important in expressing care
for the college and giving us time to work out the future,'' she
said.
   Senior Jamai Deuberry, 22, said students are confident that they
and alumnae will be able to help boost enrollment and gifts to the
school as proposed under the Mills rescue plan.
   ``We do not shy away from that responsibility,'' Deuberry said.
   The alumnae raised $3 million in a seven-day telephone fund
drive after a group of former Mills students met with Hellman.
   Teachers voted by a 2-to-1 margin to ask Mills trustees to
reverse the move and allow five years to see if changes in
recruitment and curriculum could increase enrollment.
   The students on Thursday ended their strike that included
boycotting classes.
   The switch to co-education had been considered for a year.
Enrollment in Mills' 33 undergraduate programs dipped 4.2 percent
from three years ago.
   Mills is the only single-sex undergraduate institution in
Northern California. Two women's colleges are located in Southern
California and 94 nationwide.
   The school has 50 male graduate students. Federal laws mandate
that graduate programs at all schools be open to both sexes.

   One day after another youth was convicted of
murdering a black teen-ager in an unprovoked racial attack by a
white mob, the group's alleged ringleader was acquitted of murder.
   The verdict Friday in the case of Keith Mondello, no less than
that of Joseph Fama the day before, had been closely watched by
city residents fearful that a sense of injustice could provoke
racial violence.
   Supporters of the family of the black victim, 16-year-old Yusuf
Hawkins, took to the street Friday night, but there was little
violence. Five local television news employees received minor
injuries in attacks by demonstrators.
   Hawkins was shot to death Aug. 23 after he and three friends
were surrounded by a mob of about 30 whites in the mostly
Italian-American Bensonhurst area of Brooklyn.
   Mayor David Dinkins asked New Yorkers to join in a ``weekend of
unity'' in the wake of the verdicts.
   ``I ask those of you who grieve over the loss of Yusuf not to be
swayed by those who would use this occasion to spread their venom
and cause our city more pain,'' Dinkins said.
   Mondello, his hands clenched on the table in front of him,
stared at the ceiling crying as jury forewoman Mimi Snowden
announced ``not guilty'' verdicts for charges of murder and
manslaughter.
   Before Ms. Snowden could pronounce the 19-year-old defendant
guilty of 12 lesser charges, near bedlam erupted in the courtroom
as supporters of Hawkins' parents jumped to their feet screaming at
the jurors.
   The jury convicted Mondello on charges of riot, unlawful
imprisonment, discrimination, menacing and criminal possession of a
weapon, a baseball bat. Prosecutors said they would request the
maximum sentence, eight to 24 years in prison.
   Mondello was jailed pending sentencing June 11 by Judge Thaddeus
Owens.
   But anger quickly spread to the streets outside the Brooklyn
courthouse, where scores of people had gathered for more than a
week awaiting the verdicts in the Fama and Mondello trials.
   ``I lived 60 years to see the white man win again,'' one woman
yelled.
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, a controversial activist who has assisted
Hawkins' parents through the trials, yelled to the crowd through a
bullhorn: ``We're not going to take this verdict lying down.''
   He added: ``We're going to move this city like it's never been
moved before.''
   Five television trucks were pelted with rocks while crews were
interviewing residents near Hawkins' Brooklyn residence, police
spokeswoman Sgt. Tina Mohrmann said. The windshields of some vans
were broken and the crowd tried to turn the vans over, she said.
   As they pulled hurriedly away, three vans with still-extended
transmission towers got caught in power lines and briefly blacked
out a one-block area.
   Five TV crew members were injured _ three from WCBS and two from
independent WPIX. The most serious injury was broken fingers
sustained by Alex Padilla of WCBS, Mohrmann said.
   Police reported no arrests.
   The jury, which had often appeared sharply divided and had twice
said it was deadlocked on numerous counts, delivered its verdict at
6 p.m. on the 11th day of deliberations.
   The other panel convicted Fama, 19, of second-degree murder
Thursday. He faces 25 years to life in prison.
   Confusion reigned in the tightly packed fourth-floor courtroom
as the Mondello verdict was announced.
   ``Thank God! Thank God! It's God! My mother can rest in peace!''
shouted Michael Mondello, the defendant's father. ``Jesus has
risen!''
   About eight feet away, on the opposite side of the aisle,
Hawkins' mother, Diane, crumpled sobbing into the arms of her
husband, Moses Stewart.
   ``It was a long and difficult process. We heard and reheard
several testimonies,'' Ms. Snowden said in a prepared statement.
   Neither she nor the other jurors would answer questions about
the deliberations, during which they were sequestered.
   Most of the evidence presented to the Fama and Mondello juries,
which sat together in the same courtroom throughout the trial, was
the same.
   Fama was accused of being the triggerman, while Mondello was
said to have organized the mob out of fear that a young woman had
invited her black and Hispanic friends into the neighborhood for a
rumble.
   Six other young whites still face trial for the slaying.

   An ebullient Helmut Kohl waxed poetic
after the two German nations signed a historic treaty to merge
their economies, saying that holding back unification was as futile
as trying to stop the Rhine River. The West German chancellor
beamed throughout the treaty-signing ceremony inside the opulent
government-owned Palais Schaumburg. After the East and West German
finance ministers signed the treaty, Kohl broke into a smile and
started a chorus of applause.
   The treaty all but ensures the West German chancellor's place in
history as the man who choreographed the end of Germany's
four-decade division.
   The treaty was signed Friday, just 10 days after the 45th
anniversary of Nazi Germany's May 8, 1945 defeat _ the seed of
Germany's separation.
   ``What we are living through here is the birth of a free and
united Germany,'' Kohl said.
   ``This is a historic hour in the life of the German nation,''
said the West German leader, addressing members of both his Cabinet
and that of East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere.
   But Kohl admitted there is ``still much work ahead of us'' in
negotiations between the two German nations and the four World War
II victors _ the United States, Soviet Union, Britain and France _
on the international aspects of unity.
   Formal unification cannot occur until the thorny question of a
united Germany's military allegiance is settled. The Soviet Union
rejects NATO membership for a unified Germany, while the United
States insists the German nation should belong to the NATO alliance.
   Kohl has hinted that he hopes full political unification will be
achieved in all-German elections at the end of the year.
   Despite Kohl's jubilation, German enthusiasm over the economic
merger treaty was not unanimous.
   The treaty will plunge fragile East Germany into the rigors of
capitalism starting July 2. Many East Germans fear unemployment and
price increases could be the immediate result as state subsidies
are eliminated. West Germans worry that the awesome unification
costs will lead to inflation and tax hikes.
   West Germany's leftist Greens party boycotted the treaty-signing
ceremony, charging that the agreement will leave East Germans more
impoverished than they already are.
   ``We don't want to be dazed spectators of this consummation of
subjugation,'' the Greens said in a statement.
   New Forum, the East German activist organization that started
the autumn revolution that toppled the hard-line Communist
leadership, had a similar assessment.
   ``Sacrificing all sovereignty, the GDR (East German) government
bows to the will of the victors in Bonn, whose power will triumph
in a future Germany over the dignity and interests of the GDR
populace,'' Neues Forum said.
   Hans-Jochen Vogel, head of West Germany's main opposition Social
Democratic Party, said the treaty on economic merger ``leaves open
a whole series of questions.''
   Vogel said it is still unclear, for example, how East
German-made products can be protected from competition with
better-made goods from West Germany.
   But the East German government has opted for annexation by West
Germany's own powerful economy as preferable to possible economic
collapse.
   Flanked by Kohl and de Maiziere, the finance ministers of the
two nations signed the treaty, under which East Germany's economy
and social services will be absorbed by West Germany's.
   Under the treaty, West Germany's deutsche mark will become East
Germany's legal tender. All monetary affairs will be controlled by
West Germany's central bank.
   De Maiziere said not all ``flowery dreams'' of East Germans will
be fulfilled with the treaty. ``But no one will be worse off than
before.''
   Kohl struck a surprisingly poetic note to express his belief
that unification has always been a matter of destiny.
   ``There flows the Rhine,'' said Kohl, nodding toward the
legendary river streaming past the Palais Schaumburg.
   ``It streams along on its way, seeking the sea. Naturally, you
can stem its flow or make it detour, and that would create much
trouble on the river banks.
   ``But the water reaches the sea. And that's also how it is with
the current of German history.''

   Here are the main points of the treaty
signed Friday by the two German nations, establishing monetary,
economic and social union effective July 2.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   MONETARY UNION _ The West German mark will become East Germany's
currency and the West German central bank, the Bundesbank, will
regulate all monetary policy. Funds from East German wages,
pensions and savings up to 4,000 marks will be swapped at a
one-to-one rate for West German currency, with additional savings
at two-to-one.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ECONOMIC UNION _ After four decades of a centrally planned
economy, East Germany switches to the capitalist free-market system
and private ownership. East Germany will adopt West German
monetary, economic and tax policies.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SOCIAL UNION _ West Germany's unemployment benefits, social
security and medical care system will extend to East Germany.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SUPPLY CONTRACTS _ Under the treaty, West Germany also
guarantees East Germany's supply contracts with the Soviet Union.
There is doubt whether the contracts will be renewed when they
expire and whether East Germany will continue to accept
non-convertible Soviet rubles for its products.

   Prime Minister Bob Hawke was resting
comfortably in a hospital today after undergoing prostate surgery,
a government spokesman said.
   The 60-year-old prime minister had a small non-cancerous growth
removed from his prostate gland during a one-hour operation Friday
at St. Vincent's private hospital in Sydney. A local anasthetic was
used.
   The spokesman said Hawke was ``quite comfortable'' and cheerful
today following a good night's sleep. The spokesman said there were
no complications from the surgery.
   Hawke is expected to stay in the hospital until the middle of
next week and will then rest at his home in Canberra for a week.
   Treasurer Paul Keating is acting prime minister while Hawke, who
recently was re-elected to a record fifth term, recovers from the
operation.

<HEAD>Report: Imelda Marcos Gave $50,000 in Cash to Governor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Then-Gov. George Ariyoshi of Hawaii received
$50,000 in cash from Imelda Marcos in 1982, the Los Angeles Times
reported today, quoting expense logs entered as evidence at her
racketeering trial in New York.
   The money reportedly was paid to Ariyoshi three days after the
Democrat announced his intention to run for reelection, the Times
said.
   If it was a campaign contribution, state law required it to be
reported to the Hawaii Campaign Spending Commission. In any case,
such a large contribution would have been illegal.
   State records show that Ariyoshi, governor from 1974 to 1986,
did not report the $50,000 payment from Mrs. Marcos as a campaign
contribution, the Times said.
   Ariyoshi, now a private attorney, was reportedly on a business
trip to Japan. His secretary said she had forwarded his interview
requests to him, but he had not responded by the time the story
went to print.
   In the past Ariyoshi has acknowleged getting gifts from the
Marcoses but declined to describe the extent or nature of those
offerings, calling gift-giving a ``private act of courtesy,'' the
Times said.
   Ariyoshi's name appears in the log of a July 1982 trip that Mrs.
Marcos made to the Soviet Union, Morocco and the United States, the
Times said.
   On a page listing ``cash disbursements'' for July 20, 1982, is
the brief handwritten entry: ``$50,000 _ Given to Gov. Ariyoshi,''
it said.
   The logs are written in notebooks in which a private secretary
to Mrs. Marcos, identified in testimony as longtime aide Fe Roa
Gimenez, maintained a running account of expenses incurred by Mrs.
Marcos.
   Ben Cassiday, one of Mrs. Marcos' attorneys, told Honolulu
television station KHON, that travel records show Mrs. Marcos was
not in Hawaii in July 1982.
   Cassiday said Mrs. Marcos and her late husband, former
Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, gave small gifts to Ariyoshi
over the years, but Mrs. Marcos denies giving money to Ariyoshi.
   ``She told me that she thought it very unfair that Governor
Ariyoshi was being brought into this whole entire situation,''
Cassiday said. ``And she promised me that she had never given a
dime to Governor Ariyoshi.''
   Cassiday questioned the reliability of the logs.
   ``These books and these little records are so inaccurate,'' he
said. ``Seventy percent of what's down here has already been proven
false.''
   Mrs. Marcos' trial on charges of racketeering, mail fraud and
obstruction of justice resumes Wednesday at U.S. District Court in
New York. She is accused of helping her husband embezzle $220
million from the Philippines treasury to buy New York property and
art works.
   Ariyoshi is a longtime friend of Mrs. Marcos. He was at Hickam
Air Force Base in Honolulu to greet the Marcoses in February 1986
when they fled the Philippines in the wake of an uprising that
brought Corazon Aquino to power.
   Marcos died in exile in Honolulu in September following a long
illness.

   The drive for a U.S.-Soviet summit declaration to
cut nuclear arms went into overtime today as Secretary of State
James A. Baker III delayed his departure for Washington for more
talks.
   Baker set up an extra meeting with Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevarndadze today amid indication of progress on limiting cruise
missiles, one of the toughest unresolved issues.
   A mixed working group of U.S. and Soviet experts took up the
pursuit of an agreement, with Baker and Shevardnadze awaiting the
results of their deliberations before entering the negotiations
again themselves.
   ``We haven't closed,'' a senior U.S. official said after Baker
held 10 hours of talks on Friday, five of them with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Both sides claimed progress.
   President Bush and Gorbachev would like to announce at their May
31-June 3 summit in Washington agreement on all the key issues in a
treaty to reduce the superpowers' long-range nuclear missiles,
bombers and submarines.
   U.S. and Soviet negotiators in Geneva would then work at least
through the summer to complete the details.
   ``The gaps are not seen as being unbridgeable,'' the senior U.S.
official said at a news briefing held under rules granting him
anonymity.
   He also cautioned reporters: ``I can't tell you we are going to
get there.''
   Baker had planned to fly home today after a news conference
announcing the results of his five-day visit to Moscow. Instead, he
scheduled another meeting with Shevardnadze and delayed his
departure until at least mid-afternoon.
   ``If you can close, obviously you are going to do it,'' the
senior U.S. official said. ``If you can't, it's not the end of the
world.''
   Other American officials gave a more upbeat assessment. They
said Baker and Shevardnadze had settled most of their differences
over limiting the ranges of cruise missiles carried aboard planes
and ships.
   A settlement on the elusive, nuclear-tipped weapons would clear
the biggest obstacle to a treaty cutting the overall arsenals of
U.S. and Soviet long-range nuclear weapons by 30 percent to 35
percent.
   But the officials cautioned that many details still must be
worked out.
   Baker and Shevardnadze had reported earlier Friday that they had
made progress on the treaty.
   ``I have always believed the main points will be agreed upon,''
Shevardnadze said. ``Things are moving in that direction.''
   Baker, after seeing Gorbachev, told reporters: ``We made some
progress ... We still have a number of issues that are still out
there.''
   Shevardnadze, standing at his side, chimed in: ``We did a lot.
We accomplished a lot today.''
   The foreign minister also gave a positive report on negotiations
to ban the production of chemical weapons. Asked whether a
U.S.-Soviet agreement was ready for the summit, he replied: ``Yes,
major progress was made.''
   Bush last week offered to halt the production of U.S. binary
weapons _ two chemical potions that become deadly when mixed _ if
the Soviets were willing to schedule the destruction of their
poison gas stockpiles. Shevardnadze gave no details of the emerging
accord, which is also designed for a summit signing.
   Earlier in the Kremlin, Gorbachev said his side was doing its
best to stitch together a Strategic Arms Reduction treaty. He had
been accused of backsliding by the Bush administration before
Baker's arrival here Tuesday.
   The Soviet leader said he did not know whether the goal of a
framework agreement would be met, but ``I think we are moving
closer.''

<HEAD>Jill Ireland, 54, Succumbs to Cancer After Six-Year Battle</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jill Ireland, actress, author, producer
and champion of cancer patients, succumbed to a six-year battle
with the disease.
   The British actress died Friday at her home with her actor
husband Charles Bronson and family at her side. She was 54.
   ``She was a living definition of courage,'' said actor Rod
Steiger.
   ``She'll be remembered as being a tremendous woman _ but she was
also funny, sexy, witty and a great mother,'' said Joan Rivers.
   Encouraging women who had undergone mastectomies, Miss Ireland
said, ``Think of yourself and be happy, make the most of your life
and put yourself first. ... A breast does not make me who I am.''
   Miss Ireland wrote about fighting the disease in the best-seller
``Life Wish,'' an ironic response to one of her husband's most
famous films, ``Death Wish.'' She appeared in both ``Death Wish''
films.
   At the time of her death she was completing a new book, ``Life
Times,'' a profile of her friends.
   Miss Ireland, a frequent co-star with Bronson, managed as
recently as two weeks ago to attend the wedding of her son, Paul.
Though frail, she had pledged to live to see him marry.
   In April, the actress accepted a star on the Hollywood Walk of
Fame. Though obviously not well, she smiled brightly and attended
the ceremony wearing a wig because she had lost her hair from
cancer therapy.
   Miss Ireland died at her hillside home Friday with her husband,
mother Dorothy, brother John, sons Paul and Valentine McCallum, and
daughter Zuleika Bronson at her side.
   In her books and frequent lectures about her battle with the
disease, Miss Ireland spoke eloquently about self-respect and
optimism in the face of devastating illness, calling herself a
survivor, not a victim.
   ``That's a voice the American Cancer Society could ill afford to
lose,'' said Allan Jonas, the past chairman of the National Board
of Directors for the American Cancer Society. In her speeches, Miss
Ireland stressed the importance of early detection.
   The actress first underwent surgery for removal of a cancerous
right breast and eight lymph nodes under her arm in 1984. The
cancer, after a brief remission, spread to her lungs, and last year
to her hip, femur and thyroid.
   Miss Ireland's adopted son, Jason McCallum, a longtime drug
abuser, died in November from a lethal drug mixture.
   The star of the television series ``Shane'' and a variety of
action movies like ``The Mechanic'' with Bronson, Miss Ireland was
awarded the Medal of Courage from President Reagan, the Betty Ford
Award from the Susan Komen Foundation and was a Crusade Chairman
for the American Cancer Society.
   She testified in Washington for the inclusion of mammography for
women on Medicare.
   Miss Ireland grew up in a suburb of London, the daughter of a
grocery store manager. Her mother was a dance and music devotee who
enrolled Jill in ballet school when she was only 4.
   At age 18, she performed a solo in the movie ``Oh, Rosalinda,''
which led to a film contract.
   With her first husband, actor David McCallum, co-star of ``The
Man From U.N.C.L.E.,'' she had two sons and adopted another, the
late Jason. She divorced McCallum in 1967 and married Bronson a
year later.
   In lieu of flowers, the family has asked that donations be made
to the American Cancer Society or the Susan Komen Foundation.
   Funeral arrangements are pending.

billion, Iran's official Islamic News Agency reported.
   IRNA said Industries Minister Reza Nematzadeh made the

agreements involved over 100 projects, mainly involving eduation
and heath.
   The minister said the agreements also included machinery and
work involving the oil, gas and petrochemical industries, according
to the report.
   Nematzadeh said Iranian carpets and other handicrafts exported
to Austria would be exempted from taxes.
   Recent economic relations with Tehran have been under scrunity
in Austria, with several high officials under investigation for
weapons sales during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.

   A mob hit man turned state's evidence
has been jailed for violating parole after he appeared on a
television talk show to complain that the government was exposing
him to danger.
   James Cardinali, a self-avowed killer who was the government's
chief prosecution witness in the 1987 trial of reputed New York mob
boss John Gotti, was jailed Thursday.
   Corrections officer Joseph Garcia said Cardinali, 40, was being
held in the protective custody unit of the Bernalillo County
detention center.
   Cardinali returned to Albuquerque Wedneswday after appearing the
night before in Washington, D.C., on CNN's ``Larry King Live.''
During the show, Cardinali said he had been warned not to fly to
Washington.
   The U.S. Marshals Service, which runs the witness protection
program, will neither confirm nor deny whether Cardinali is a
participant. But Garcia said records showed Cardinali was being
held for pickup by a U.S. marshal.
   Cardinali last month picketed the federal courthouse in
Albuquerque with a sandwich board sign that read: ``Marked to die
by the Justice Dept.'' and ``Mob Star Witness'' on the other.
   In May, he demonstrated in front of a building where Attorney
General Richard Thornburgh was speaking.
   Cardinali, of New York, said the government granted him immunity
in five drug-related murders and promised to protect him for life
in return for his weeklong testimony in 1986 against Gotti, reputed
leader of the Gambino crime family. Gotti was acquitted of
racketeering and conspiracy charges.
   After serving five years and seven months in jail, Cardinali
allegedly was placed in the protection program and given a new
identity and financial support. He said he was removed last July
for confiding his identity to a girlfriend.
   He said he fears he will be gunned down by Gotti's people.

<TEXT>
   Dozens of radical students attacked
two police stations with firebombs today, and riot police
surrounded a university where about 15,000 militants had thrown up
barricades.
   The protests followed a rampage through downtown streets Friday
night by thousands of anti-government protesters after a rally
marking the 10th anniversary of a pro-democracy uprising in the
southern city that was crushed by the military.
   About 2,000 riot police armed with shields and clubs sealed off
the campus of Chonnam University on the northern edge of Kwangju.
About 230 students were arrested by police near the campus, the
national news agency Yonhap said.
   At a rally inside the campus, thousands of radical students
jabbed their fists in the air and screamed ``Down with (President)
Roh Tae-woo!'' and ``Yankee go home!''
   ``Our nation has no hope until Roh Tae-woo is ousted,'' student
leader Song Gap-suk told the rally. Song is one of 17 student
militants sought by police on charges of instigating violent
anti-government protests.
   Students used tires, school desks, chairs and broken furniture
to erect 10-foot-high barricades at the university's three gates.
More than 500 students armed with three-foot metal pipes stood
guard inside the gates.
   Groups of several hundred radical students marched around the
sprawling campus throughout the day singing protest songs.
   Police set up roadblocks around Kwangju to prevent more people
from joining the protesters.
   At dawn today, police fired warning shots into the air from
pistols and rifles, as dozens of militant students attacked two
Kwangju police stations with firebombs, Yonhap reported.
   The students fled, and no arrests or damage were reported, the
news agency said.
   Police said about 5,300 people were arrested Friday in
nationwide protests in more than a dozen cities marking the 10th
anniversary of a pro-democracy uprising in Kwangju, a city of more
than 1 million people about 150 miles south of Seoul.
   Police said all but 481 of the 4,325 arrested in Seoul had been
released. In Kwangju, police said 123 people were arrested and at
least 20 injured. Another 23 were injured in other cities.
   The Kwangju uprising began when hundreds of thousands of
citizens rose up against the central government to protest a
crackdown on political dissent. Protesters took control of the city
for 10 days before being crushed by tank-led paratroopers.
   By official count, about 200 people were killed and more than
1,700 others injured. Kwangju citizens claim the death toll was
much higher.
   In Kwangju, about 7,000 radical students and citizens rampaged
through downtown streets late Friday, hurling rocks at police and
burning tires at intersections.
   The street clashes erupted after a peaceful three-hour nighttime
rally by about 100,000 people in the city center to demand the
ouster of the Roh government and the 43,000 American troops in
South Korea under a mutual defense treaty.
   Roh, a former army general, is unpopular in Kwangju because of
his alleged role in crushing the 1980 revolt. He was a key member
of the then-martial-law government that suppressed the uprising,
the worst in modern Korean history.
   Anti-U.S. sentiment is also strong among Kwangju citizens
because many believe Washington condoned the ruthless crushing of
the revolt. The United States has repeatedly denied the charges.
   After the initial nighttime rally, thousands of students marched
along downtown streets, shouting anti-government and anti-U.S.
slogans.
   When blocked by squads of riot police near a district
headquarters of Roh's governing party, the protests turned violent.
Groups of 200 to 1,000 demonstrators clashed with police at street
corners and in back alleys.
   Protesters hurled rocks at riot police, who responded with tear
gas.
   Angry citizens fought alongside the students, throwing bricks,
boards and bicycles at police. Protesters ripped apart telephone
booths and street signs to make weapons.

   The Chrysler Corp. said its new
400-horsepower Dodge Viper sports car has a top speed of 190 miles
per hour and will cost ``under $50,000'' when it goes on the market
in 1992.
   The company on Friday unveiled the car, powered by a V-10 engine
originally designed for trucks. Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca said
it could accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 3.9 seconds.
   Chrysler officials said they eventually expect to produce about
5,000 Vipers a year, to be sold at 300 to 500 U.S. dealerships.
   The Viper's development cost Chrysler ``tens and tens of
millions _ not hundreds of millions,'' Iacocca said, adding it
could make money for the company at a sales pace of 5,000 cars a
year.
   Features on the sleek two-seater, which debuted at the Detroit
auto show in January 1989, include an integrated roll bar and
exhaust pipes built into a cutaway side. It is designed to compete
with Chevrolet's high-performance Corvette.
   Among the team members who came up with the Viper concept was
Chrysler consultant Carroll Shelby, father of the popular Shelby
Cobras.
   Iacocca told reporters at a downtown news conference that it was
Shelby who edged him out of getting the first Cobra produced in the
1960s.
   Shelby has been offered millions and millions of dollars for
that car, Iacocca noted ruefully.
   ``I am not making the same mistake twice,'' he said pointing to
a red Viper on display. ``This one here is mine.''

<HEAD>Gov't Announces Plan To Fight Terrorism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has announced a plan to
fight terrorism but says it will not create a new unit to replace
the hated secret police of the previous military regime.
   Interior Minister Enrique Krauss said the government is instead
reinforcing the nation's regular police services because ``they are
the only institutions legally in charge of guaranteeing public
order and security.''
   Krauss told a new conference that the government is already
allocating additional funds to police to hire more personnel and
purchase new equipment. He did not elaborate.
   Under the previous rule of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the security
work was carried out by a secret police agency known as National
Information Central, which was widely accused of torture, killing
and the illegal arrest of dissidents.
   Pinochet's agency, made up mostly of military officers,
maintained secret detention centers and its agents worked under
assumed names. It was disbanded shortly before Pinochet handed over
power March 11 to his elected civilian successor, Patricio Aylwin.
   The secret police files were either destroyed or transferred to
the army, which has not made them available to the new government.
Pinochet remains army commander.
   Since its inauguration, the Aylwin government has faced sporadic
political violence and terrorism. In March, two retired army
generals were shot and seriously wounded by a pro-Communist leftist
guerrilla group. Last week, a retired police colonel who was
prominent in Pinochet's secret service was killed.
   A series of recent bombings in Santiago has damaged government,
military and business targets.
   Krauss said those actions ``seek to damage the democratic
process,'' and vowed that the government ``will do whatever
necessary to safeguard'' the newly restored democracy.
   Aylwin is the first civilian president since Salvador Allende,
who was overthrown by Pinochet's forces in 1973.

<HEAD>Professor Arrested for Covering Nude Statue to Protest Obscenity
Charges</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A professor was charged with disorderly
conduct for draping a bikini over the bare breasts of the city's
most recognized statue to protest the prosecution of an art gallery
for obscenity.
   The Contemporary Arts Center and its director, Dennis Barrie,
were indicted in April over an exhibit containing sexually explicit
photographs by the late Robert Mapplethorpe.
   Michael D. Shapiro, a math professor at Ohio State University in
Columbus, said he came out of a visit to the arts center last
Sunday outraged at the prosecution. He noticed that nude statues
were on display in the center of nearby Fountain Square, which is
the heart of the city.
   ``When I walked out of the Mapplethorpe exhibit and saw a naked
statue of a child less than a block away, the irony struck me,''
Shapiro, 41, said today in the Columbus Dispatch. ``It just showed
me that the attacks on the Mapplethorpe exhibit are politically
motivated and not about nudity.''
   Shapiro also wrapped a flourescent orange diaper with black
hearts over the buttocks of a statue of a nude boy.
   ``The officer who arrested me said, `You can do a lot of things
in this town, but don't mess with the statue,''' he said.
   Shapiro pleaded no contest Tuesday in Hamilton County Municipal
Court. He was not fined or sentenced, but was ordered to pay $32 in
court costs.
   The arts center and Barrie were indicted by a Hamilton County
grand jury on charges of pandering obscenity and using pictures of
children in material involving nudity when the exhibit opened April
7. Seven photographs in the 175-piece exhibit display naked
children or homoeroticism.

<TEXT>
   Lithuania's parliament began an emergency session
today on compromise proposals that leaders of the secessionist
Baltic republic hope will lead to negotiations with the Kremlin.
   Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene opened the
session of the Supreme Council by telling the lawmakers of her
talks in Moscow with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
according to a spokeswoman for the parliament.
   Lawmakers were to consider compromise measures that would keep
Lithuania in the Soviet defense system, address border issues and
outline a transition period to full independence.
   The measures are contingent, however, on the Kremlin beginning
negotiations with Lithuania. It does not call for suspending or
rescinding the republic's March 11 declaration of independence.
   Since March 11 and throughout a subsequent economic embargo on
oil, natural gas and other key materials imposed on the republic by
Gorbachev, Lithuanian officials have refused to roll back on the
declaration. They have said other issues may be negotiated.
   In an hourlong meeting with Mrs. Prunskiene on Friday, Secretary
of State James A. Baker III had urged her to consider suspending
the declaration, according to a U.S. official who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Before she returned to the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius, Mrs.
Prunskiene told reporters that her meeting with Baker gave
Lithuania a boost.
   ``I became convinced again that the U.S.A. as well as other
governments support the restoration of independence and the path we
are taking,'' she said at the U.S. ambassador's residence where she
met with Baker.
   The prime minister said she told Baker about Lithuania's plan
and her talks with Gorbachev a day earlier.
   Baker said, ``We had a full discussion on the situation with
respect to the Baltics, particularly Lithuania. We are very
hopeful, as we have been for some time, that a dialogue can begin.
It remains to be seen the degree to that which will be continued.''
   He has said the Baltic impasse was casting a shadow over the
summit later this month in Washington between Gorbachev and
President Bush.
   Another U.S. official, also speaking anonymously, said Baker
told Mrs. Prunskiene ``a way has to be found'' to settle the
dispute.
   A recommendation to suspend independence would go a step beyond
a formula proposed last month by French President Francois
Mitterrand and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl to suspend
subsequent laws implementing the declaration.
   Mrs. Prunskiene also told reporters that Gorbachev and Premier
Nikolai Ryzhkov hinted that stricter economic measures would be
taken against Lithuania ``if we don't behave more rationally.'' She
said the Soviets did not elaborate.
   Mrs. Prunskiene's meeting with Gorbachev on Thursday marked the
first time the Soviet president has sat down with Baltic officials
to discuss their independence drive. He has branded their
declarations of independence void and imposed an economic blockade
against Lithuania.
   Gorbachev also has ruled parliaments in the the neighboring
Baltic republics of Latvia and Estonia acted illegally by approving
declarations calling for independence over a transition period, but
so far he has not invoked sanctions against them.
   Mrs. Prunskiene told a news conference that progress was made
but that the Soviets were insisting that Lithuania rescind its
declaration.
   Pro-Soviet forces in Vilnius stepped up their pressure Friday.
   Thousands of Soviet troops remain in Lithuania and the republic
is suffering from an oil and natural gas blockade that Gorbachev
imposed to stop the secession. The Lithuanian economy is closely
meshed with that of the Soviet Union.
   In Vilnius, thousands of anti-independence demonstrators
demanded the secessionist government resign and that Soviet rule be
restored.
   Military helicopters dropped leaflets saying, ``Down with the
Government of Separatists! Long Live Soviet Lithuania.''
   Supporters of independence gathered around the Lithuanian
Parliament building to block any attempt by pro-Soviet forces to
occupy it, said Eduardas Potashinskas, an editor at Lithuanian
television.
   The pro-Soviet crowds dispersed by evening, but pro-independence
guards remained around the building into the night, said Simas
Ardjiunas, a parliamentary spokesman.

   A charter bus carrying European tourists
lost its brakes on a winding mountain highway, slammed into an
embankment and rolled over, killing one person and injuring 44
others, authorities said.
   Passengers trapped inside the bus Friday screamed for help,
while others sat dazed outside. Rescuers had to pry out a woman who
was wedged beneath a seat.
   The California Highway Patrol identified the dead woman as
Marguerite Finat, 60, of Marseilles, France.
   Ambulances and helicopters ferried the injured from the crash
site on Highway 168 to hospitals in nearby Bishop, Calif. and Reno,
Nev., some 200 miles to the north.
   The bus driver, Juan Garcia, 30, of Phoenix, Ariz., was driving
down a six percent grade when his brakes failed, said highway
patrol Sgt. Ray Dixon. Unable to down shift to from third gear to
second, Garcia chose to drive into the embankment rather than a
rock bed, Dixon said.
   ``He was probably going too fast to get it into second but he
probably saved a lot of lives by doing that,'' Dixon said.
   The bus, operated by Southwest Charter Co. of Phoenix, Ariz.,
had left Las Vegas and was bound for Mammoth Lakes. It carried
tourists from Belgium, France, Germany and Austria, said Lt. Phil
Downs.
   The passengers ranged in age from 10 years to the mid-70s, said
Northern Inyo Hospital administrator Herman Spencer. The language
barrier complicated treatment, he said.

<HEAD>Flood-Weary Texans Get Aid, Louisiana Farmland Under Water</HEAD>

   The swollen Red River pushed southward today in Louisiana, where
it has swamped 80,000 acres of rich farmland, and flood victims in
Texas got relief checks to help make it through the high-water days.
   The Army Corps of Engineers predicted 700,000 acres will be
flooded in Louisiana before the river and backwaters recede.
   The Red River, swollen with draining floodwaters from states
upstream, was expected to crest Sunday in Alexandria, in central
Louisiana, at 40 feet, eight feet over flood stage.
   ``In Louisiana we have one commodity ready to harvest, winter
wheat. That's gone in the flooded areas,'' said Larry Michaud of
the state Agriculture Department. ``There will be extensive damage
to the cotton in the area.
   ``Along the Red there are levees for the most part. The farms
inside the levees are the ones that are hurt,'' he said.
   In Texas, 38 counties have been declared federal disaster areas.
   Brad Harris, regional head of the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, was distributing relief checks Friiday. He said at least
3,000 people already have requested aid, and that his agency ``bent
the rules'' to get it to them.
   ``Now I can go find a place on dry land,'' said Laura Baird,
whose family has refused to leave their floodwater-surrounded home
near Kenefick because they had no money. She received a $415 check.
   ``They're saying we should have water in the house by tonight
and 4 to 5 feet in a few days,'' she said.
   Flooding that plagued Texas, Arkansas and Oklahoma during the
past three weeks has also forced dozens of people out of their
homes in southern Indiana, Missouri, and southern Illinois.
   Thirteen people have perished in Texas and one in Oklahoma from
the flooding, which has caused hundreds of millions of dollars in
damage.
   In Texas, floodwaters from rain-swollen Lake Livingston, about
75 miles northeast of Houston, were expected to inundate more than
200 square miles along the Trinity River.
   Water moved toward San Jacinto County, where 800 to 900 homes
are already flooded or at risk, said county sheriff's spokesman
Ricky Sanders. More than 375 people in that county and four others
have been evacuated since last week.
   Agricultural damage in Texas has been estimated at at least $700
million and at least $60 million to residences.
   Near Pineville, La., a National Guard truck helped Mildred Johns
move from her house inside the levee. The water in her front yard
was 3 to 5 feet deep.
   ``I held up pretty good until this morning,'' said Johns.
   In Missouri, floods have covered 800,000 acres of corn fields,
but not all will have to be replanted, officials said.
   Floodwaters from the swollen Missouri River has damaged or
destroyed more than 700 homes in Kansas City, and about 360 people
have been evacuated.
   ``We have people who have lost everything _ every scrap they
owned,'' said Colleen McQuillan, a Red Cross spokeswoman. ``Then
there are those who just need to have eyeglasses replaced, or a
bed, maybe some kitchen appliances.''
   An estimated 1,000 people were out of their homes in
Mississippi, where floods occur every spring. Gov. Ray Mabus has
issued a statewide disaster declaration.
   In southern Indiana, people used boats to get around flooded
streets in the small town of West Baden Springs, and officials
worried that rain-swollen rivers could make things worse.
   Illinois' floods mainly hit farm areas, and no evacuations were
reported.

   The nation's largest ecumenical group welcomed
the coming visit of anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela to the
United States but said apartheid should be lifted before South
Africa's president is invited.
   The National Council of Churches wrapped up it policy-making
meeting Friday with a resolution criticizing President Bush's
decision to receive South African President F.W. de Klerk.
   ``Any signal of support of de Klerk will send the African
National Congress a message we are backing away from our call for
the dismantling of apartheid,'' said the Rev. Tyrone Pitts of the
Progressive National Baptist Convention.
   The church council, which represents most major Anglican,
Orthodox and Protestant religions, but not Roman Catholics,
comprises 32 denominations with 42 million members.
   The council also regretted the U.S. congressional recognition of
Jerusalem as Israel's capital, asked American companies to stop
buying coffee from El Salvador and called for the withdrawal of all
American soldiers from the Philippines by 1996.
   The council said Jerusalem is threatened by actions favoring one
religion, such as the non-binding congressional measure.
   The city is ``a focus of deepest religious inspiration and
attachment of'' Judaism, Christianity and Islam, the council said.
   The council asked Israeli leaders to remove Jewish settlers from
St. John's Hospice, a Greek Orthodox shelter.
   About 150 armed Jewish settlers, backed by $1.8 million from the
Israeli government, moved in during the week before Easter. Last
week an Israeli court ordered all but 20 settlers to leave until
the court resolves the issue.
   The hospice is across the street from the Church of the Holy
Sepulchre, believed by Roman Catholic and many Orthodox religions
to be the burial site of Jesus Christ.
   The church deplored the Supreme Court's decision in April that
said a state could deny jobless benefits to American Indians who
use the hallucinogenic drug peyote in religious rituals.
   The council ``urges its member communions to alert their
constituents to this incredible loss of protection for religious
rights because of an aggressive and radical exercise in judicial
activism.''

<HEAD>Disease That Killed Muppet Creator on the Rise, Researchers Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Muppets creator Jim Henson died of severe
pneumonia caused by a rare complication from a common bacteria _
but not as rare as it used to be.
   The pneumonia began with an infection with group A streptococcus
bacteria, which cause ``a wide variety of infections, but most are
mild infections, such as sore throat and impetigo,'' said Centers
for Disease Control spokesman Chuck Fallis.
   CDC researchers cautioned in January that group A streptococcus
infections ``have re-emerged as a public health problem.'' But the
Atlanta-based agency said ``factors contributing to the apparent
recent increase ... are unclear.''
   Among several recent outbreaks of group A streptococcal illness
was an outbreak of bacteremia _ a severe bloodstream infection _ in
Denver last year. Nineteen cases were confirmed in one hospital in
the first eight months of 1989, where just three had been reported
in all of 1987.
   Those serious bloodstream infections occur in just four or five
cases per 100,000 Americans each year, Fallis said. ``It's still
uncommon.'' Of those severe infections, only one in five patients
goes on to develop pneumonia, such as Henson did.
   Henson had complained of cold symptoms to a physician cousin the
weekend before his death Wednesday. He did not see a doctor for
treatment until he checked into a New York hospital Tuesday
morning, after he began having trouble breathing.
   By that point, doctors said, the bacterial infection from his
lungs had begun attacking other organs and the illness could no
longer be controlled with antibiotics.
   The fatality rate associated with group A streptococcus
bacteremia is between 20 percent and 30 percent, Fallis said.
   Serious group A streptococcal infections ``generally occur in
the elderly, or in people with decreased immunity because of an
underlying illness, such as cancer,'' Fallis said.
   Before the recent rise in serious group A streptococcal
infections, they had been less common than in previous generations.
   ``Over the past five decades, the rate and severity had been
decreasing,'' Fallis said.
   Infections are usually easily treated, if caught in time; the
bacteria are quite sensitive to penicillin.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of students and professors held
sit-ins today to protest the nomination of the nation's only
four-star general as the country's next prime minister.
   But a government spokesman dismissed as ``hogwash'' the
protesters' claim that the appointment of Defense Minister Hau
Pei-tsun as prime minister represents a move toward military rule.
   The demonstrations came on the eve of the inauguration of
President Lee Teng-hui, who will be sworn in for a regular six-year
term Sunday.
   Earlier this month, Lee surprised the nation by announcing that
he would ask Hau to head the government. The president is expected
to formally nominate Hau as prime minister Sunday. The appointment
must be approved by parliament.
   During his inauguration, Lee is also expected to make a major
policy statement on improving relations with the Communist
government in China. He may also announce the release of political
prisoners.
   About 300 students, many wearing yellow headbands reading
``Oppose military interference in government,'' staged a sit-in
today in the rain at Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Park to oppose Hau's
nomination. Hundreds more were expected to join the demonstration
Sunday.
   Meanwhile, a sit-in at another downtown park by professors and
artists opposed to Hau entered its second day.
   Hau's nomination ``is not only unconstitutional but
anti-democratic,'' said Chang Chung-tung, a history professor at
the National Taiwan University.
   He said it would ``bring back an atmosphere of fear and
suppression experienced so painfully by the people in this island
in the past 40 years of martial law.''
   The governing Nationalist Party has gradually eased its
authoritarian grip on Taiwan in recent years _ lifting martial law,
allowing opposition political parties and giving more government
posts to native Taiwanese who account for 85 percent of the
island's 20 million people.
   But Hau belongs to the Nationalist old guard that fled to Taiwan
with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in 1949 after losing a civil war
to Communist forces on the Chinese mainland.
   About 20 professors met Lee on Friday to express their concerns
and demand an end to the appointment of retired military officials
to top intelligence, diplomatic and media posts.
   Government spokesman Shaw Yu-ming said that ``nobody in this
land ... can turn the clock back.'' He said claims the government
was moving toward military rule were ``hogwash. Nobody would accept
that.''
   Political observers said Hau's appointment represents an attempt
by Lee to expand his power base and stem criticism among aging
Nationalist conservatives who have questioned his pragmatic policy
toward their sworn enemies in Beijing.
   Lee became the first native Taiwanese to lead the government in
January 1988 when he moved up from the vice presidency to succeed
President Chiang Ching-kuo, who died in office. Chiang was the
eldest son of Chiang Kai-shek.

   A 76-year-old man has been fined $25 and
ordered to do community service for throwing coffee on a cigar
smoker.
   Veldie Kelley was sentenced Friday for his conviction on charges
he threw lukewarm coffee at a man who brought a cigar into the
no-smoking section of a McDonald's restaurant.
   Fayette County Circuit Judge Joseph Fribley said Kelley's
conduct was ``pretty childish'' for a man his age.
   A jury last month convicted Kelley, who was responsible for
establishing a no-smoking section in the restaurant, of battery. He
faced a $1,000 fine and up to 364 days in jail.
   Fribley put Kelley on nine months court supervision and ordered
him to do five hours of community service a week for two months.
Kelley also will be banned from the McDonald's, from which he once
was ejected for throwing a glass of water on a cigarette-smoking
employee, for the duration of the supervision.
   ``I'm not a lawbreaker,'' Kelley said after the sentencing. ``I
done it to protect my health. If he hadn't of let out the smoke, he
wouldn't have gotten'' the coffee thrown at him.
   Kelley says he has a severe allergy to smoke. During his trial,
Kelley said McDonald's employees and customers ``made a game'' out
of smoking near him.

   Lava from Kilauea Volcano destroyed
three more houses in this coastal community, and President Bush
declared the region a disaster area.
   None of the 31 remaining dwellings were in immediate danger from
the lava flow, which wiped out much of the community in April and
early May, said Hawaii County Civil Defense spokesman Dennis
Shigeta.
   A total of 142 dwellings have been demolished since the volcano

   Kalapana's only store and one of its two churches still stand.
The other church was hauled to safety.
   The molten rock also has destroyed a national park visitor
center, 2{ miles of roads, 2 miles of water lines and 2 miles of
electric lines.
   Gov. John Waihee, who previously issued a state disaster
declaration, estimated damage at $61 million.
   The federal disaster declaration was made effective back to the
start of the eruption.
   The federal aid can take the form of temporary housing, grants,
low-cost loans for uninsured property owners and other assistance
to help individuals and businesses recover from the disaster.

   Marlon Brando's son was ordered held without
bail after he pleaded innocent to first-degree murder in the
shooting death of his pregnant half-sister's boyfriend.
   Municipal Judge Rosemary Shumsky on Friday denied an urgent plea
from the attorneys of Christian Brando, 32, that a bail hearing be
held immediately.
   Shumsky agreed to a bail hearing on Tuesday after the prosecutor
said he wasn't ready to argue bail.
   Unshaven and dressed in a shirt and jeans, the younger Brando
sat silently in a crowded courtroom while his lawyers entered an
innocent plea to first-degree murder.
   In addition to the murder count, Christian pleaded innocent to
possession of a machine gun and a silencer found following the
shooting in the den of his father's home. The weapons weren't used
in the shooting, authorities said.
   He is charged in the death of Dag Drollet, 26, a guest at the
home and the son of a Tahitian official.
   Drollet reportedly was father of 20-year-old Tarita Cheyenne
Brando's unborn child. Police said the shooting apparently was
sparked by an argument over Drollet's treatment of Miss Brando.
They said there were allegations that Drollet beat the actor's
daughter.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III resumed
negotiations today with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze in a drive for a U.S.-Soviet summit declaration to cut
nuclear arms.
   A working group of U.S. and Soviet experts met for three hours
today in pursuit of an agreement, then Baker and Shevardnadze
entered the negotiations themselves.
   Baker had delayed his departure for Washington and set up the
extra meeting amid indication of progress on limiting cruise
missiles, one of the toughest unresolved issues.
   ``We haven't closed,'' a senior U.S. official said after Baker
held 10 hours of talks on Friday, five of them with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Both sides claimed progress.
   President Bush and Gorbachev would like to announce at their May
31-June 3 summit in Washington agreement on all the key issues in a
treaty to reduce the superpowers' long-range nuclear missiles,
bombers and submarines.
   U.S. and Soviet negotiators in Geneva would then work at least
through the summer to complete the details.
   ``The gaps are not seen as being unbridgeable,'' the senior U.S.
official said at a news briefing held under rules granting him
anonymity.
   He also cautioned reporters: ``I can't tell you we are going to
get there.''
   Baker had planned to fly home today after a news conference
announcing the results of his five-day visit to Moscow. Instead, he
scheduled another meeting with Shevardnadze and delayed his
departure until at least mid-afternoon.
   ``If you can close, obviously you are going to do it,'' the
senior U.S. official said. ``If you can't, it's not the end of the
world.''
   Other American officials gave a more upbeat assessment. They
said Baker and Shevardnadze had settled most of their differences
over limiting the ranges of cruise missiles carried aboard planes
and ships.
   A settlement on the elusive, nuclear-tipped weapons would clear
the biggest obstacle to a treaty cutting the overall arsenals of
U.S. and Soviet long-range nuclear weapons by 30 percent to 35
percent.
   But the officials cautioned that many details still must be
worked out.
   Baker and Shevardnadze had reported earlier Friday that they had
made progress on the treaty.
   ``I have always believed the main points will be agreed upon,''
Shevardnadze said. ``Things are moving in that direction.''
   Baker, after seeing Gorbachev, told reporters: ``We made some
progress ... We still have a number of issues that are still out
there.''
   Shevardnadze, standing at his side, chimed in: ``We did a lot.
We accomplished a lot today.''
   The foreign minister also gave a positive report on negotiations
to ban the production of chemical weapons. Asked whether a
U.S.-Soviet agreement was ready for the summit, he replied: ``Yes,
major progress was made.''
   Bush last week offered to halt the production of U.S. binary
weapons _ two chemical potions that become deadly when mixed _ if
the Soviets were willing to schedule the destruction of their
poison gas stockpiles. Shevardnadze gave no details of the emerging
accord, which is also designed for a summit signing.
   Earlier in the Kremlin, Gorbachev said his side was doing its
best to stitch together a Strategic Arms Reduction treaty. He had
been accused of backsliding by the Bush administration before
Baker's arrival here Tuesday.
   The Soviet leader said he did not know whether the goal of a
framework agreement would be met, but ``I think we are moving
closer.''

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Hosni Mubarak has completed a
six-year process of reconciliation with the Soviet Union without
damaging Egypt's special relationship with the United States.
   Mubarak returned home with political and economic benefits for
Egypt after a 46-hour visit to Moscow this week, the first by an
Egyptian head of state in 18 years.
   He won Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's public support for
his Middle East policies. It included Gorbachev's strong
condemnation of Israel for allowing Soviet Jewish immigrants to
settle in occupied Arab territories.
   The two nations also signed an agreement that holds the promise
of substantial Soviet economic aid for Egypt during the 1990s.
   Perhaps more importantly, the improvement in Cairo-Moscow
relations has not come at Washington's expense.
   There was no hint during Mubarak's visit of any Soviet intent to
revive the Kremlin's old role as Egypt's principal arms supplier, a
function that the United States assumed in 1980. Nor was there any
suggestion of Moscow trying to join the United States in current
Middle East peacemaking efforts.
   Rather, Mubarak came away with a Soviet pledge to support U.S.
and Egyptian efforts to initiate a Palestinian-Israeli dialogue in
Cairo. Previously, Moscow's policy focused solely on the
Israeli-spurned idea of an international Middle East peace
conference.
   Mubarak's visit came six years after he initiated a policy of
trying to normalize relations with the Soviet Union, where as a
young air force officer he trained to be a fighter pilot.
   He began by restoring diplomatic representation to the level of
ambassador. Later, he mended other fences smashed by his
predecessor, Anwar Sadat.
   Sadat, assassinated by Moslem extremists almost nine years ago,
was the last Egyptian head of state to visit Moscow, in 1972 just
before relations soured. First the Soviets refused to meet Egypt's
arms requests. Sadat reacted with sweeping reprisals including
expelling 17,000 Soviet military personnel.
   Despite the improvement in relations since 1984, there remained
what one Egyptian official termed ``a psychological shortcoming in
terms of the absence of personal, face-to-face contact at the top.''
   Mubarak's visit to Moscow from Monday to Wednesday sealed that
breach.
   Ibrahim Nafei, editor of Cairo's leading newspaper Al-Ahram and
a member of Mubarak's entourage, wrote that the meeting ``rectified
the balance of relations and put them in the proper context.''
   ``More accurately, it codified the relationship ... on the
footing of close personal knowledge between the two leaders that
had been missing.''
   The visit was part of an Asian-European tour that also took
Mubarak to China, North Korea, Oman and Britain.
   Before setting out, Mubarak made clear his objectives included
seeking economic benefits and marshaling opposition to the settling
of Soviet Jewish immigrants in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   He evidently succeeded.
   In a Moscow dinner speech honoring Mubarak, Gorbachev denounced
settling Jewish immigrants among the 1.7 million Palestinians
living in the West Bank and Gaza as ``anti-Soviet.'' It is part of
``insidious designs'' by Israel, he said.
   ``To push emigrants to Israel into doing that amounts to
dangerously and immorally playing with their fates,'' Gorbachev
said.
   It was Moscow's strongest censure of Israel since the influx of
Soviet Jews began last fall. Israel captured the West Bank from
Jordan and Gaza from Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Officials in Cairo said the Soviets promised to consider
Egyptian ideas on the emigration issue. One would grant Soviet Jews
the right to return if they find difficulties in Israel after
emigrating. Another would ask the United States to relax
restrictions on Soviet Jewish immigration.
   Hundreds of thousands of Soviet Jews are expected to emigrate to
Israel in the next few years as the result of a relaxation of
travel regulations in the Soviet Union and a tighter entry quota in
the United States.
   Israel says it has no policy of settling the new arrivals in the
occupied territories.
   Gorbachev and Mubarak also signed a joint declaration that
reflected an apparent shift by Moscow on Middle East peacemaking.
The joint declaration clearly gave precedence to U.S.-brokered
peace talks over an international conference aimed at reaching an
overall Middle East settlement.
   The two countries signed a 10-year agreement that sets
guidelines for economic, commercial, scientific and technological
cooperation.
   Under the accord, Egyptian officials anticipate receiving Soviet
economic aid amounting to $700 million to $800 million. They said
this would include expansion of Egypt's steel and aluminum
industries, originally built with Soviet help, and construction of
new power stations.
   In addition, the official Middle East News Agency said Saturday
the Soviet Union had promised Egypt major debt relief that includes
repayment in goods rather than cash. The news agency, which did not
cite its sources, said under the agreement, Egypt would pay only
about 7 percent of the debt's value at the official exchange rate,
beginning after a six-year grace period.
   The news agency said the debt totaled 2.2 billion rubles, or
$3.58 billion at the official exchange rate.

<HEAD>East Germany Tightens Restrictions on Romanian Refugees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Romanians seeking to enter East Germany now
must prove they have a personal invitation from an East German, the
government says.
   The tightening of visa requirements on Friday was part of an
effort to stem a flood of refugees from Romania.
   The move drew criticism, however, from the East German
commissioner for foreigners. ``Our historic and humanitarian
responsibility ... demands more far-sightedness,'' said Almuth
Berger.
   Nearly 2,000 Romanian refugees have been housed at barracks
buildings around East Berlin. Thousands more are believed inside
the country, and train stations have become homes to hundreds.
   The Romanians are lured by East Germany's imminent unification
with West Germany and are also fleeing political strife and
uncertainty in their own country.
   Romanians overthrew Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in a
bloody December revolution. They are scheduled to vote in national
elections Sunday after a campaign that has frequently turned
violent.
   In another move, the East German government said it was lifting
visa requirements for citizens of Belgium, France, Luxemburg and
the Netherlands, the state news service ADN reported. The new rules
allow citizens of those countries to enter without visas and stay
for up to three months.
   The government also was preparing to lift visa requirements for
citizens of Greece, Great Britain, Ireland, Sweden, Norway, Malta,
Portugal and Switzerland, ADN said.
   It said the actions were aimed at advancing European unity.
Westerners had only limited travel privileges in the country under
the ousted Communist government.
   An estimated 500,000 East Germans fled their own country over
the past year to escape the former Communist government and seek
prosperity in the West. They were taken in by West Germany.
   Their exodus gave rise to East Germany's peaceful revolution
that toppled four decades of Communism and led to the nation's
first democratic government.
   A flood of Romanians, Poles and other groups into East Germany
in recent months has heightened German resentment of foreigners as
the nation moves closer to a free market.
   The two Germanys signed an economic treaty on Friday and plan to
merge their economies by July 2. The merger is expected to force
many East German factories to close, triggering widespread
unemployment.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of foreign observers spread
out across the country today to monitor Romania's first free
elections in more than 50 years, and several said they were
checking reports of campaign irregularities.
   Anti-Communist demonstrators continued to defy a ban on
political rallies before Sunday's presidential and parliamentary
elections, occupying a downtown square for the 28th straight day.
   Many of the 700 protesters in the square today said they feared
the elections would be rigged.
   ``They will fiddle with the votes in the computers _ and we are
scared of the outcome,'' said 23-year-old Beatrice Andrei, who has
slept in University Square, a main traffic artery, for 20 days.
   Gheorghe Ivescu, a 43-year-old engineer, said: ``When we come
out of the polling booth, they'll ask us `who did you vote for' and
then punch us if we voted against the Front.''
   Interim President Ion Iliescu and his National Salvation Front
lead in the campaign for the presidency and seats in a two-chamber
Parliament. Iliescu has two presidential opponents, and 82
opposition parties are fielding slates for Parliament.
   The Front came to power in the violent December revolution that
ousted Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, and the protesters
accuse it of wanting to retain the Communist political system.
   The election obervers include a 60-member international
delegation sponsored by the U.S. Republican and Democratic parties'
Institutes for International Affairs.
   At a news conference Friday night, several said they were
investigating reports of intimidation, violence, and irregularities
in the campaign, which officially ended at midnight Thursday.
   ``No one has suggested ... that the election has been carried
out without difficulty,'' said Roy Hattersley, a member of the
British Parliament. ``We can't tell the extent of the problems.''
   ``Every party leader and candidate for president has talked
about intimidation of himself and his staff,'' Hattersley said.
   Jim King, senior vice president at Northeastern University in
Boston, said even if the number of observers is small, their
presence is crucial.
   ``The world is watching and that has a cooling effect on those
with hot heads, and it gives a powerful push for those people who
want tolerance and fair elections,'' he said.
   King said he believed the government had not done enough to stop
harassment and intimidation. He said he had seen policemen stand by
and do nothing to halt such acts.
   Late Friday, thousands of anti-Communist protesters gathered on
University Square in downtown Bucharest. Those remaining early
today jeered loudly at a TV-screen-sized movie of Iliescu being
shown on the wall of a building on the square. Demonstrators have
occupied the square since April 22, demanding Iliescu and other
former Communists quit politics.
   Polls of uncertain accuracy indicate Iliescu, a 60-year-old
former Communist minister demoted after criticizing Ceausescu in
1971, will get up to 60 percent of the presidential vote. His main
rivals are Radu Campeanu of the National Liberal Party and Ion
Ratiu of the National Peasants Party.
   The Front also expects to win a majority in Parliament.
   ``Our round-the-clock protest will continue until we get our
liberty back, until democracy is restored in our country!'' protest
leader Dumitru Dinca shouted to the demonstrators.
   Iliescu had said the protesters should be ``cleaned out'' of the
square after the campaign officially closed Thursday. Campaigning
and political rallies are banned the last two days of the campaign.
   But Premier Petre Roman said the government decided to tolerate
the demonstrators' ``violation of the law'' for the time being.
   In campaign violence Thursday in Timisoara, where the revolution
began, the Front and opposition accused each other of inciting
attacks at a Front rally.
   The electoral commission said Friday that 15.9 million Romanians
aged 18 or over are eligible to vote in the country's first free
elections in 53 years.

<HEAD>New Political Alliance Supports Walesa Presidency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DRUSILLA MENAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new political alliance has backed Lech
Walesa for president in another sign of the growing disagreement
between the Solidarity leader and Poland's Solidarity-dominated
government.
   The new group, the Center Alliance, was formed by a close Walesa
advisor and favors speeding up economic and political reform.
   It also wants Poland's current president, former Communist Party
chief Wojciech Jaruzelski, to step aside.
   The Solidarity government has launched an ambitious
top-to-bottom overhaul of the socialist economic system. But Walesa
has pressed for an even faster expunging of the former government's
personnel and policies.
   ``The acceleration we are proposing is to do away with the
remnants of the old system,'' Sen. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who is
spearheading the new alliance, said Friday. Kaczynski is editor of
the weekly Tygodnik Solidarnosc and a member of Walesa's inner
circle.
   The alliance has issued a founding declaration, but it is not a
formal political party.
   The split over the pace of reforms goes back to the April 1989
accord signed by then-Communist authorities and Solidarity. It
paved the way for democratic parliamentary elections that led to
the takeover of the government by Solidarity.
   But under the accord, parliament seats were guaranteed to the
subsequently dissolved Communist Party, the interior and defense
ministers were retained from the former government, and Jaruzelski
was installed as president to smooth the transition and help
maintain relations with the Soviet Union.
   With the democratization elsewhere in Eastern Europe in recent
months, some say the accord is out of date.
   ``The round-table agreement cannot be binding any longer,''
Kaczynski said. ``Jaruzelski should come to the conclusion that his
mission is concluded.''
   Jaruzelski's presidential term lasts until 1995, and fully free
parliamentary voting is not scheduled until 1993. But there is
pressure from many quarters to speed up the timetable, possibly as
part of a rewriting of the Polish Constitution.
   Walesa has fueled the debate with his interest in the presidency
and his criticism, recently more strident, of the government of
Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a former Solidarity leader
himself. Kaczynski said his declaration of support for Walesa is
not a move against Mazowiecki.
   ``It is true that there is some argument about whether we should
continue in small steps or make quick, radical changes. It is true
that we differ in our assessment of the situation. But...we don't
want to remove Mazowiecki,'' he said.
   Kaczynski said Walesa supports his group, but that the alliance
will not dissolve if he rejects its suggestion that he run for
president.
   ``Our main goal is capitalism,'' Kaczynski said.

   Alabama authorities have finally got a
firm hold on Carl Guenther Jr.
   Twenty-eight years after staging a holdup in Montgomery,
Guenther is behind bars serving out a 25-year sentence.
   In the intervening years, he escaped from a state prison, won
asylum in his home state of Michigan, pulled a fat income as the
owner of a tree-pruning business, got married and raised two
children.
   Guenther, of Port Huron, Mich., was 16 years old and working for
a traveling carnival when he robbed a man of his car at gunpoint in
Montgomery in 1962, authorities said. The police caught up with him
but Guenther got loose, slipping back to Michigan when he was
released on bond.
   In 1965, he was convicted of burglary and served 18 months in a
Michigan prison. When he got out, Alabama authorities said they
wanted to talk.
   ``They sent me a letter, and I bought a bus ticket down here,''
Guenther, 45, said in a recent interview at Montgomery's Kilby
Correctional Center. ``I wanted to get this thing resolved.''
   A Montgomery court did just that, convicting him of robbery and
sentencing him to 25 years on Oct. 12, 1967, according to state
records. A year later, Guenther broke out with three other inmates.
   He lived in New Orleans, Florida and South America, then moved
back home in the 1970s, working as a farm manager in Benton Harbor,
Mich., before opening a tree service in Port Huron in 1977.
   ``I was making $50,000 or $60,000 a year,'' Guenther said. ``I
thought I was a pretty damn productive citizen.''
   When he was picked up on a traffic violation in 1976, police
discovered he was wanted in Alabama. Gov. George C. Wallace sought
his extradition, but Guenther found help in Michigan Gov. William
Milliken.
   Mark Blumer, an assistant Michigan attorney general who
represented Alabama in extradition proceedings, said an aide to
Milliken recommended asylum. While Blumer said there was no records
showing it was formally approved, Guenther was never extradited.
   In 1983, Guenther was convicted of drunken driving and Wallace's
office again intervened. But Guenther got protection from Gov.
James Blanchard.
   In a letter to Wallace, Blanchard wrote that Guenther ``has
lived in Michigan successfully for 20 years, established a
profitable business, and supported a family. ... He has never
broken the law.''
   In 1986, Guenther pleading guilty to sexually abusing the the
adolescent daughter of a woman he was living with, and was
sentenced to 4-to-15 years in jail.
   When he won parole, Guenther went to federal court to try to
block his extradition. But U.S. District Judge Richard A. Enslen
ruled in March that he could be extradited under a 1987 U.S.
Supreme Court ruling that said federal courts could force states to
honor extradition requests by other states.
   Guenther arrived in Montgomery on April 11, said Kilby prison
spokeswoman Debbie Herbert. Unless he is paroled, he is due to
finish his sentence on May 22, 2003, she said.
   Guenther believes he has paid for mistakes made as a teen-ager _
``Hell, yes, I think I've been mistreated.''
   But some officials regard him as a habitual criminal who used a
gift of gab to avoid prison.
   ``In discussing it with some of the attorneys involved, they
said he would have been all right if he had been a salesman,'' said
an official in Blanchard's office who spoke on condition she was
not identified.
   Said Blumer: ``As far as we were concerned, he was a person who
had abused a rather extraordinary privilege. We were quite pleased
that Alabama still wanted him, and we were very happy to send him.''
   Guenther has not heard yet if he'll be prosecuted for the 1968
breakout.
   ``I'm not going to try to escape again. I wouldn't leave if they
set me out in the yard,'' he said.

   Lithuania's prime minister warned lawmakers today
that if they give in to Moscow's demand to suspend their
declaration of independence, the Baltic republic risks coming back
under Kremlin control.
   Kazimiera Prunskiene's comments came as Lithuania's parliament,
meeting in emergency session, considered compromise proposals that
leaders of the secessionist republic hope will lead to negotiations
with the Kremlin.
   The prime minister briefed lawmakers on her talks in Moscow on
Thursday with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, according to Rita
Dapkus, a spokeswoman for the parliament.
   Gorbachev said the republic's March 11 declaration of
independence must be suspended, which was a softening of his
original demand to revoke it.
   But Mrs. Prunskiene told lawmakers that even suspension would be
too risky, said parliamentary spokesman Ed Tuskenis.
   Ms. Dapkus quoted the prime minister as saying if the
declaration were suspended, Lithuania might again be subject to
Soviet law.
   The compromise measures being considered by the Supreme Council,
or Lithuanian parliament, outline a transition period to full
independence.
   The measures are contingent, however, on the Kremlin beginning
negotiations with Lithuania. They do not call for suspending or
rescinding the republic's March 11 declaration of independence.
   Ms. Dapkus said the lawmakers were not expected to take any
action today.
   During the session, 200 supporters of independence gathered
outside the building to keep anti-secessionists from coming in, Ms.
Dapkus said.
   Last week, anti-independence protesters tried to enter
parliament buildings in Estonia and Latvia, but police or
volunteers stopped them.
   In an hourlong meeting with Mrs. Prunskiene on Friday, Secretary
of State James A. Baker III urged her to consider suspending the
declaration, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Before she returned to the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, Mrs.
Prunskiene told reporters that her meeting with Baker gave
Lithuania a boost.
   ``I became convinced again that the U.S.A. as well as other
governments support the restoration of independence and the path we
are taking,'' she said at the U.S. ambassador's residence where she
met with Baker.
   The prime minister said she told Baker about Lithuania's plan
and her talks with Gorbachev a day earlier.
   Baker said, ``We had a full discussion on the situation with
respect to the Baltics, particularly Lithuania. We are very
hopeful, as we have been for some time, that a dialogue can begin.''
   He has said the Baltic impasse was casting a shadow over the
summit later this month in Washington between Gorbachev and
President Bush.
   Another U.S. official, also speaking anonymously, said Baker
told Mrs. Prunskiene ``a way has to be found'' to settle the
dispute.
   A recommendation to suspend independence would go a step beyond
a formula proposed last month by French President Francois
Mitterrand and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl to suspend
subsequent laws implementing the declaration.
   Mrs. Prunskiene also told reporters that Gorbachev and Premier
Nikolai Ryzhkov hinted that stricter economic measures would be
taken against Lithuania ``if we don't behave more rationally.'' She
said the Soviets did not elaborate.
   Mrs. Prunskiene's meeting with Gorbachev on Thursday marked the
first time the Soviet president has sat down with Baltic officials
to discuss their independence drive. He has branded their
declarations of independence void and imposed an economic blockade
against Lithuania.
   Gorbachev also has ruled parliaments in the the neighboring
Baltic republics of Latvia and Estonia acted illegally by approving
declarations calling for independence over a transition period, but
so far he has not invoked sanctions against them.
   Mrs. Prunskiene told a news conference that progress was made
but that the Soviets were insisting that Lithuania rescind its
declaration.
   Pro-Soviet forces in Vilnius stepped up their pressure Friday.
   Thousands of Soviet troops remain in Lithuania and the republic
is suffering from an oil and natural gas blockade that Gorbachev
imposed. The Lithuanian economy is closely meshed with the Soviet
Union's.
   In Vilnius, thousands of anti-independence demonstrators
demanded the secessionist government resign and that Soviet rule be
restored.
   Military helicopters dropped leaflets saying, ``Down with the
Government of Separatists! Long Live Soviet Lithuania.''
   Supporters of independence gathered around the Lithuanian
Parliament building to block any attempt by pro-Soviet forces to
occupy it, said Eduardas Potashinskas, an editor at Lithuanian
television.
   The pro-Soviet crowds dispersed by evening, but pro-independence
guards remained around the building into the night, said Simas
Ardjiunas, a parliamentary spokesman.

   An empty grave is kept ready at the new
``Martyrs Cemetery'' to receive the next victim of Kashmir's revolt
against Indian rule.
   On the topmost branch of an ancient chinar tree a few yards
away, the bright green flag of Islam flutters briskly in a light
breeze that somehow fails to stir the drooping banner of the
Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front.
   But the spirit of the insurrection is far from sagging, despite
the presence of Indian troops on every major street, despite
hospital wards full of people with bullet wounds and beating
injuries they say the ``alien'' soldiers inflicted, despite a
counterinsurgency campaign that has sent leaders of the freedom
movement into deeper hiding in the tangle of narrow alleyways.
   No one doubts there will be more ``shaheed,'' or martyrs, for
the graves under the chinar tree and the scores of other new burial
grounds in the Kashmir Valley below the snow-capped Himalayas.
   Nearly 400 people, mostly Moslem militants or their supporters,
have been killed since Jan. 20, when the government began its
harshest crackdown on the Kashmir secessionist movement. The
movement has simmered, sputtered or flared for 43 years, and
exploded last winter into assassinations, bombings and kidnappings.
   The Kashmir crisis is a legacy of 1947, when Britain left the
Indian subcontinent, one of the unruliest expanses of its
once-mighty empire.
   Hindus and Moslems were unable to reconcile under the banner of
a single country, so the vast territory was partitioned into
secular India, dominated by Hindus, and the Islamic Republic of
Pakistan.
   Both claimed Kashmir, a predominantly Moslem region whose Hindu
maharajah hemmed and hawed until Pakistani tribesmen invaded his
Western domains. He hastily cast his lot with India.
   Pakistan and India bisected Kashmir. Two wars failed to settle
the sovereignty issue, and it threatens to drag them into another.
   The cry for freedom is heard today throughout Srinagar, summer
capital of Jammu-Kashmir, the only Indian state with a Moslem
majority.
   It is whispered by shoppers to foreigners who cycle past Indian
guns in the heart of the old city. It is spoken with defiance and
resolution by businessmen, doctors and civil servants in homes and
offices, chanted by toddlers prompted by their elders, shouted by
young men, rasped by old men and women.
   It is categorically rejected by the government of Prime Minister
V.P. Singh in New Delhi and the appointed governor of
Jammu-Kashmir, a tough-minded Hindu who uses the single name
Jagmohan and sits in the magnificent isolation of an old princely
residence overlooking Dal Lake.
   ``Our only demand is freedom,'' said Hilal Ahmad Beg. ``We want
our Kashmir.''
   Beg, 26, leads the Students Liberation Front, which kidnapped a
Moslem university vice chancellor and a Hindu industrialist six
weeks ago and killed them when Jagmohan refused to release three
jailed militants.
   Instead, the governor ordered 15 days of around-the-clock curfew
and house-to-house searches. He said they resulted in the arrests
of 836 people, ranging from terrorists to people of ``bad
character'' who took advantage of the unrest to commit nonpolitical
crimes.
   All but 249 have been released, Jagmohan said.
   The dragnet missed Beg, who said the authorities do not have
have his photograph and he walks unchallenged past Indian troops.
Indeed, he strolled openly, though watchfully, down a street and
into a building to meet a reporter for an interview arranged
through intermediaries.
   Only three days earlier, Beg said, he led a midday attack that
killed a paramilitary trooper in the center of Srinagar.
   The neatly dressed leader of the Students Liberation Front
readily acknowleged he had been too busy with militant activities
for the past eight years to enroll anywhere as a student. On at
least three occasions, Beg said, he went to Pakistani Kashmir for
up to 3{ months of military training.
   His group is a wing of the oldest secessionist group, the
Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, whose leader, Amanullah Khan, is
based in the Pakistani part of Kashmir.
   Beg and other militants said the independent Kashmir they
envision should include the predominantly Hindu Jammu region plus
both parts of divided Kashmir.
   Their state would be a landlocked enclave bordering,
Afghanistan, China, Pakistan and India. Its main economic base is a
multimillion-dollar tourist business that has evaporated during the
violence.
   Frustration with such a limited economy helped spur the revolt.
   In Srinagar, multilingual Moslems with university degrees work
as office clerks and shopkeepers. They accuse Indian officials of
reserving a disproportionate share of state government posts for
Hindus.
   Resentment of the government crackdown feeds the fire of
independence. Any conversation with a half-dozen or more people
seems to produce at least one man or woman who angrily displays
gashes, bruises or cast-covered bone fractures blamed on Indian
soldiers or paramilitary forces.
   At SHMS Hospital _ no one calls it Sri Hari Maharajah Singh
Hospital _ a black scrawl on the wall declares: ``Long live free
Kashmir. The death of the martyr is the life of the nation.''
   Hospital rooms turn into miniature political rallies as
relatives, even strangers visiting patients in other wards, crowd
around the latest to be admitted.
   Mohammad Ashraf Khan, 25, hopped on his remaining foot and
maneuvered with crutches to the bedside of his mother, Janna,
recently admitted with two bullet wounds in her right shoulder. She
said she was hit by paramilitary troopers who opened fire after
they were attacked by militants.
   Khan's right leg was amputated at the knee two months ago _ the
result, he said, of being shot by security troops as he walked down
a street during a curfew relaxation.
   Even when he had two legs, Khan said, he had not been able to
find a job, despite having a college degree.
   ``It is dangerous to be a young man in Srinagar,'' said Shaheeda
Shireen, a 30-year-old bank manager watching from the doorway.
   ``It is also dangerous to be an old man,'' she said, turning to
cross the hall to the room of her 68-year-old uncle, Gul Mohammad,
who says he was shot at point-blank range by paramilitary troopers
at his home.
   On the hill overlooking Dal Lake, Gov. Jagmohan said his policy
of ``firmness and fairness'' would break the revolt.
   ``Our effort is to deal firmly with the terrorists who have got
the guns and just want to shoot and kill people,'' he said. ``A
stitch in time saves a lot of things.''
   Asked about allegations of government brutality, he said: ``Our
instructions are very strict that we do not tolerate any such thing.
   ``So far as roughing up people, when we are operating in such a
big way, some sort of aberration at the lower level is inevitable.
Supposing there are six or seven bombs exploding, and a man has a
rifle in his hands and he's scared. We have to understand.''

   A Bahamian-registered cargo ship and a Japanese
fishing boat collided in heavy fog off Japan's northern island of
Hokkaido early Saturday, leaving two Japanese fishermen missing,
officials said.
   The Reeferl Sachi, a 2,340-ton cargo ship carrying 17 South
Korean crewmen, collided with the No. 25 Hamanaka-Maru, a 19-ton
salmon fishing boat with nine crewmen, about 20 miles off Rakushi
Point at the eastern edge of Hokkaido.
   Two fishermen, Hideaki Kayukawa and Tadafumi Murata, both 23,
were missing. The rest of the crew escaped from the damaged vessel
in a life boat, an official of the Maritime Safety Agency said on
condition of anonoymity.
   The official said the missing two might still be on the damaged
vessel. The extent of damage to the ship is still unknown.
   The cargo ship had been en route to Kushiro, 550 miles northwest
of Tokyo.

<HEAD>Showdown Time Arrives in Senate for Ban on Assault Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate conservatives are pushing hard to erase
a ban on assault rifles from an election-year crime package set for
floor action this week.
   But the bill's supporters have no intention of giving up without
a fight.
   ``The Senate really faces a choice of do we side with the gun
lobby or do we side with law enforcement,'' said Sen. Paul Simon,
D-Ill. ``Faced with that choice, I'm going to support law
enforcement.''
   Police groups have backed the bill's ban on sale and manufacture
of nine types of semiautomatic assault weapons, while the National
Rifle Association has lobbied to have the provision dropped.
   The wide-ranging package also would authorize the death penalty
for 30 federal crimes, including presidential assassination, and
reshape the sometimes drawn-out post-appeals process under which
convicts seek new trials.
   It also would fine tune the nation's money-laundering laws and
reverse Attorney General Dick Thornburgh's decision to give local
U.S. attorneys control over the Justice Department's
organized-crime strike forces.
   Thornburgh says he ``revitalized'' the forces, which in recent
years have put scores of organized crime figures behind bars. But
at least 75 percent of the attorneys have resigned from the units
since his decision.
   The bill has been hanging fire in the Senate for months. It
began as part of the Bush administration's 1989 anti-crime package
but has since been completely overhauled by Senate Judiciary
Chairman Joseph R. Biden, D-Del., and other Democrats on the panel.
   The Bush administration now opposes the bulk of the package.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, planned to
start debate Monday, with the first votes on what promises to be a
raft of amendments coming Tuesday. He set aside the entire week for
action on the bill and warned that some midnight oil might be
needed.
   Supporters and critics alike said the National Rifle Association
made headway in its drive to dump the assault weapons provision.
``My guess is that it will be knocked out, although I will vote to
keep it,'' Simon said.
   ``I think it's probably pretty close,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah. ``The lobbying's been real hard, but I believe we have the
votes to strike it.''
   As usual, the gun group's rhetoric has been freewheeling and
muscular. NRA legislative official Wayne LaPierre asked members of
the group in a letter in February:
   ``Would you be shocked if I told you that Michael Dukakis had
been elected to the United States Senate and was on the verge of
passing a bill to ban guns? Well, that nightmare is not as far from
the truth as you might imagine.''
   It said Biden and other sponsors ``are banking on their buddies
in the national news media saturating the television airwaves,
radio frequencies and magazine racks with hysterical anti-firearms
propaganda.''
   On the other side, Handgun Control Inc. has been running
advertisements showing a sinister-looking TEC-9 machine pistol
labeled ``a drug dealer's best friend.'' Handgun Control
spokeswoman Gwen Fitzgerald said the group hopes to stamp that
label on any senator who moves to drop the assault weapons
provision from the package.
   ``They may be able to do it, but hopefully we'll be able to make
them sorry,'' she said.
   The Bush administration has been pushing a rival plan that would
ban domestic assembly of foreign assault weapons and clips of more
than 15 rounds.
   Conservatives have been pressing for limits on the post-appeals
process in which convicts can obtain a federal court review of
their cases and perhaps a new trial by claiming their
constitutional rights were violated the first time around.
   Critics of the system point to seemingly endless delays in
carrying out executions because of almost open ended ``habeas
corpus'' proceedings.
   The Biden version would tighten the process in some ways but
open a new opportunity for convicts to claim they had been
victimized by a ``miscarriage of justice.''
   The bill also contains a provision sponsored by Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., that would allow those sentenced to death to use
statistical evidence to show they were victims of discrimination
against minorities.
   Conservatives say this ``racial justice act'' measure represents
an indirect attempt to outlaw capital punishment.
   Meanwhile, Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., and his allies want to
add a provision that would permit courts hearing criminal cases to
consider evidence obtained in searches without warrants.
   The Biden bill would restate a Supreme Court decision under
which evidence may be admitted if obtained with a flawed warrant _
but not if there were no warrant at all.

   Three skinheads admitted they desecrated 100 graves
at a Roman Catholic cemetery and tried to make it appear that Jews
carried out the attack to avenge the vandalism of Jewish
cemeteries, police said.
   The three appeared in court Friday and wore masks provided by
police, who feared possible reprisals against the skinheads or
their families.
   They did not enter pleas during their court appearance, but
police said they had confessed.
   There has been a series of attacks on Jewish cemeteries in
recent weeks that started in France. Vandalism since has been
reported in Italy and Canada.
   In the case in France, police said the skinheads wanted people
to believe the vandalism Wednesday night in Nantes was committed in
revenge for the gruesome desecration last week at a Jewish cemetery
in Carpentras. A corpse there was dug up and impaled on an umbrella
handle.
   Slogans painted on graves in the Nantes suburb of Saint Herblain
included ``Carpentras will be avenged'' and ``Death to Le Pen'' _ a
reference to far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen.
   The skinheads, all in their early 20s, were arrested at their
homes in Nantes late Thursday and early Friday.
   They face sentences of up to two years in prison if convicted on
the charges of vandalism and provoking racial hatred.
   Police said people living near the cemetery were awakened by
noise during the incident and took down the license plate of one of
the suspects. After his arrest, he provided the names of his two
accomplices and the three quickly admitted the acts, police said.
   The three remain jailed at Nantes prison in Brittany.
   The Carpentras case remains unsolved. The government said it was
considering posting a reward, a step rarely taken in France.
   Skinheads in France generally sympathize with neo-Nazi groups
and have shaved heads or close-cropped hair.
   In Royan, a regional government education official served as
substitute teacher Friday for Christiane Guiard, who was severely
beaten by two masked intruders at her home after she devoted a
class to the ramifications of the Carpentras desecration.
   The administrator, Loic Legoherel, presented a brief discourse
on freedom in France to three classes of Ms. Guiard, a high school
history and geography teacher.
   ``Violence, while always unacceptable, is particularly odious
when it is aimed at teachers, for whom freedom of speech is
essential,'' Legoherel said.
   About 1,500 people attended a rally Friday in Royan in
solidarity with Ms. Guiard, police said.

   When President Bush went to violence-torn
Colombia to talk about drugs, no one worried more about his safety
than White House physician Burton Lee.
   ``I thought it was a dangerous play,'' Lee says. ``I didn't
particularly want him to go. I thought it was asking for it.''
   Lee and his staff of 16, together with a handful of civilian and
military surgeons, set up a seagoing trauma center on a U.S.
aircraft carrier. It was equipped to deal with casualties up to the
level of what Lee likened to ``invasion catastrophies.''
   The well-guarded president was not his only worry.
   ``One of the principal concerns of the people in the White House
was that we thought the press corps was going to get it. I was set
up for 20 or 30 of the press corps if they had gotten hit,'' he
says.
   To Lee's relief, the facility went unused during the one-day
presidential trip, which ended without violence.
   ``I think it was really quite dangerous and when it was over we
were all very happy,'' he said in an interview.
   The drug summit was ``by far'' the biggest operation yet for
Lee, the doctor with principal responsibility for the president's
health.
   It was not the job he had in mind when Bush, a longtime friend,
tapped him to come to Washington.
   ``I wanted something in the drug-fighting game,'' he said _
perhaps the drug czar post that went to former Education Secretary
William Bennett.
   But ultimately he gave up his large lymphoma practice at New
York's Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to become White House
physician.
   As such, he or someone from his staff must be within a few steps
of the president at all times.
   He travels with the president aboard Air Force One. He oversees
the president's physical exams, and Mrs. Bush's. He joins Bush on
fishing excursions, their shared passion.
   And he often pokes into health-care policy issues that are not
within the purview of his office, earning a reputation in some
administration quarters as a gadfly. One conservative official
called him ``a well-meaning kibitzer.''
   Lee says ministering to Bush's health is fairly uncomplicated
because the 65-year-old president is in excellent shape.
   During a rapid-paced ``power walk'' along the shore of
Kennebunkport, Maine, this winter, the 60-year-old Lee, trim and
fit himself, ended up having to hitch a ride in a police car
because he couldn't keep up with Bush.
   ``I got so far behind the police started asking me who I was,''
he lamented.
   Lee is close to both the president and Mrs. Bush and is known as
a great raconteur.
   A lifetime medical professional, he has an intensity befitting
his profession, his administration colleagues say. Perhaps because
of that, he has had a tendency to speak his mind even if it doesn't
follow the official administration line.
   He got into a bit of hot water by revealing that he does not hew
to the GOP's anti-abortion position. He was quoted as suggesting
the administration used an abortion litmus test in appointing
high-level officials, and he said that Bush would never pick him as
surgeon general.
   Explaining the flap now, he says, ``I think that the person that
fills that particular position should agree with the president on
his stated views on abortion.''
   Working on President Reagan's AIDS commission was one of Lee's
proudest accomplishments.
   He was a key architect of the committee's 200-page report that
generated considerable controversy when it was released in June
1988.
   ``Burt was enormously influential'' and dedicated on the
committee, even though he still had his New York practice, said
Polly Galt, former executive director of the commission. ``He
really puts his money and time where his mouth is.''
   Lee's passion these days is health-care financing reform, a
topic on which no dramatic steps are expected from the Bush
administration.
   ``Since I was originally mainly interested in dealing with
issues here, I'm trying to spread my wings in this job,''
participating on government panels dealing with health care
financing and liability reform, he said.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said today a
``trail-blazing agreement'' on U.S.-Soviet cooperation to ban
superpower production of chemical weapons will be signed at the
Washington summit.
   The two sides have also resolved major disputes on cutting their
strategic nuclear arms, Baker announced at a news conference after
concluding talks aimed at setting the stage for the U.S.-Soviet
summit from May 30-June 3.
   President Bush, who was in Houston, called the development
``encouraging'' and added that ``some problems still remain to be
solved.''
   ``It's a mixed review right now,'' Bush said. ``It's interesting
developments. We're not sure we know all of it yet.''
   Baker's comments followed four days of intensive negotiations on
an agenda for the summit that Bush will host for Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Baker acknowledged failure to bridge differences on reducing
troops and tanks in Europe, but otherwise gave a positive account
of his talks with Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze.
   Baker said he offered new approaches on cutting conventional
arms, but found ``our counterparts were unable to respond at this
time.''
   Looking tired as he prepared to fly home to report to Bush,
Baker said ``we have been engaged in some heavy lifting,'' and had
achieved ``some real accomplishments.'' He added: ``The results
make us optimistic we can have a productive summit.''
   The projected chemical weapons accord is designed to set a
pattern for 40 nations negotiating a global ban on chemicals
weapons production. The two superpowers would destroy their
stockpiles over several years. Some two dozen nations are believed
to have the capability to produce poison gas.
   ``We have reached agreement on a precedent-setting accord,''
Baker said. ``I believe that this agreement is very significant,
particularly as it provides a real pathway toward a global ban on
horrific weapons that we already know from bitter experience
actually get used,'' he said.
   During Baker's talks, attention was focused primarily on the
drive for an agreement on reducing U.S. and Soviet long-range
nuclear missiles, bombers and submarines.
   The goal was a declaration to crown the summit in Washington.
   While some issues remain, Baker said, he reached agreement with
the Soviets on ``two of the most vexing problems we have faced:
air-launched cruise missiles, and sea-launched cruise missiles.''
   A settlement on the elusive, nuclear-tipped weapons would clear
the biggest obstacle to a treaty cutting the overall arsenals of
U.S. and Soviet long-range nuclear weapons by 30 percent to 35
percent.
   Missiles carried on fighter planes would be restricted under a
``complicated formula which equitably meets the needs of both
sides'' he said.
   As for sea-launched cruise missiles, Baker said the superpowers
agreed to a declaration outside the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.
   ``The declaration will enhance both strategic stability and
predictability without creating verifications difficulties for
either side,'' he said.

   The main issue in next Sunday's
presidential elections is whether to negotiate with cocaine barons,
whose henchmen police say have stalked and killed three candidates.
   It's easy to tell where the four surviving candidates stand.
   The two who favor talks with drug traffickers are out kissing
babies. The two who reject negotiations speak only on radio and
television. They make no public appearances, and small armies of
security men surround their homes and offices 24 hours a day.
   President Virgilio Barco, who ordered security forces to crush
the traffickers after a leading presidential candidate was
assassinated in August, has refused to negotiate. His four years
end Aug. 7 and the constitution does not allow a second consecutive
term.
   The question of negotiations overshadows all others, many of
which also relate to the drug trade.
   They include constitutional changes giving the president more
power to combat traffickers; agrarian reform, which would split up
the traffickers' vast holdings; overhaul of an antiquated judicial
system; and anti-corruption measures.
   None of the four candidates agreed to be interviewed by The
Associated Press.
   Cesar Gaviria and Antonio Navarro have said they would give no
quarter to drug traffickers.
   Both replaced presidential candidates police say were
assassinated by traffickers. Gaviria and Navarro say they have
received numerous death threats and have relied largely on free air
time on state-owned radio and TV stations to get their message to
the people.
   Gaviria replaced Luis Carlos Galan of the governing Liberal
Party, who had urged the government to act against the drug barons
while there was still time.
   Galan was shot down Aug. 18 as he stood on a large wooden
platform delivering a campaign speech in a lower-class Bogota
neighborhood. About 60 heavily armed security men were in the crowd
to guard him.
   Gaviria, 43, would be Colombia's youngest president. He is a
former treasury minister and former minister of government, which
put him in charge of internal security.
   He got 51 percent of the vote March 11 in a five-way party
contest to choose a single candidate, and he is heavily favored to
win the May 27 election.
   About 60 percent of Colombia's registered voters are Liberals,
and roughly 35 percent support the Conservative Party. The
remainder favor the leftist Patriotic Union and other small
organizations.
   Gaviria does not speak out on drug trafficking, but when pressed
by reporters, he pledges to continue the government effort against
the cocaine gangs.
   Navarro, the other candidate who would give no quarter, is a
disabled former guerrilla of the April 19 Movement.
   His guerrilla group, known as M-19, signed a peace agreement
with the government in March, disbanded and became a political
party. The M-19 commander, Carlos Pizarro, became a presidential
candidate.
   An assassin killed Pizarro on a domestic airline flight April
23. Navarro, second in command of M-19, took his place in the
presidential race.
   Navarro also has been the victim of violence. A hand grenade was
tossed into a bar where he and friends had gathered in the western
city of Cali. He lost a leg and his rapid-fire manner of speaking.
His speech now is hesitant and slurred.
   It is unclear whether drug traffickers killed Pizarro. Colombian
newspapers have made much of his declaration in talks with the
government last year that he opposed extraditing Colombians to the
United States. Extradition is the government weapon feared most by
the traffickers.
   Pizarro was a nationalist, however, and declared that Colombia
should solve its own problems. He said drug trafficking was no
exception, which would make it appear he was not an ally of the
cocaine lords.
   Drug gangs have been killing guerrillas and other leftists since
the sister of some prominent traffickers was kidnapped about 10
years ago. She was released on payment of $10 million ransom.
   Semana, a Colombian news magazine, quoted Navarro recently as
saying he opposes extradition because he, like Pizarro, believes
Colombia must solve its own problems. He said the government's only
choice is to fight the traffickers.
   A third presidential candidate, leftist Bernardo Jaramillo, was
assassinated March 22. Police said he was killed by the Medellin
cartel, Colombia's main cocaine gang.
   Jaramillo was the candidate of the Patriotic Union Party, which
has said it will not put up another candidate.
   Rodrigo Lloreda, one of the candidates favoring negotiations, is
a former foreign minister and is the Conservative Party candidate.
He has made clear that he would stop extraditing traffickers to the
United States.
   Alvaro Gomez, who also says the government and traffickers
should talk, is the son of Laureano Gomez, who was president in
1950-51. He opposes extraditions. A former Conservative Party
member, he leads the independent National Salvation Movement.
   Neither Lloreda nor Gomez has said how he would treat other
demands of the drug gangs, which go beyond insisting merely on a
halt to extradition.
   Statements attributed to the traffickers, and uncontested by
them, have said the Medellin cartel wants to become a political
force. Many read that to mean the cocaine barons want to run the
country.

<HEAD>The Man Who Would Replace Gadhafi</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prince Idris al-Sanusi is confident that by
this time next year he'll be on the throne in Libya. He's so sure,
in fact, that he is making the rounds of world capitals to
introduce himself as Libya's future monarch.
   Idris, whose great uncle King Idris I was overthrown by Col.
Moammar Gadhafi in 1969, was in Washington recently meeting with
Republicans in Congress, with officials in government and with
business representatives.
   Lounging in his hotel suite, the pretender to the throne said he
was making plans for the day Gadhafi is overthrown. And that day,
he said, is near.
   ``We have strong signals from within Libya that they want the
Sanusi family to rule,'' he said in an interview. He added that an
underground group of loyalists was defying Gadhafi's iron rule and
sending out messages.
   Western officials are skeptical that an organized opposition
exists within Libya.
   Idris reasons that Gadhafi has been increasingly isolated in
recent months by a decline in support from the Soviet Union, and
from East Germany and other East European governments which have
since fallen.
   Once European governments understand that there is a viable
alternative to Gadhafi, Idris said, they too will isolate him and
give Libyans the impetus to revolt.
   Gadhafi should go quietly into exile to prevent bloodshed. Idris
will head a temporary government until free elections can be held.
The new Libya will destroy Gadhafi's arsenal of chemical weapons _
Gadhafi claims there are none _ give up support for terrorism and
become a responsible member of the world community.
   Despite Gadhafi's autocratic rule and periodic reports that he
was about to be toppled, Western and Arab diplomats in Tripoli see
no indication he is about to go. Idris also likely would face a
challenge from other exiled opposition groups, who have failed to
mount a serious threat to Gadhafi partly because of in-fighting.
   Idris' family derives its legitimacy in part from a direct line
of descent from the Prophet Mohammed, founder of Islam. But Idris
describes himself as a moderate Moslem, and envisages a Libya
tolerant of opposing views and religions.
   ``I may even take a drink once in a while,'' despite Islam's
strict prohibition on alcohol, he said.
   Idris, who was raised in Europe and is fluent in five languages,
has married Christian women _ first an American and then a Spanish
Catholic noblewoman, daughter of the Marquis of Leon. Recently they
had an audience with Pope John Paul II.
   Idris' family left Libya without much money but he has gone on
to do well as an oil consultant for European and Middle Eastern
firms and governments.
   He was a jet setter until he had to ditch the Lear for fear
Gadhafi might try to assassinate him. Gadhafi once tried to place a
bomb in his father's car, Idris said.
   He describes himself as impetuous in his youth. When he first
started to organize an opposition to Gadhafi, ``I made the mistake
of approaching the CIA and other agencies,'' he said. ``But now I
have matured and I know that Gadhafi can only be removed by the
Libyan people themselves.''
   His message to the international business community, which has
substantial investments in Libyan oil fields, is to refrain from
interfering in a revolt against Gadhafi, Idris said.
   Idris said investors want Gadhafi to stay in power because he
gives them exclusive contracts and fat commissions.
   A democratic Libyan government would reassess its contracts with
foreign companies, he said. ``I say you'll have a more healthy
relationship with us ... maybe less profit,'' he said.
   From Washington he travels to East Europe, where he will offer
his help in facilitating oil purchases for the newly emerging
democracies from the Persian Gulf, Idris said.
   The Soviet Union, which is experiencing a drop in oil
production, has cut exports to its East European clients and is
demanding payment in hard cash rather than goods and services.
   Idris said he could use his contacts to obtain easy terms for
East European oil purchases in the Mideast, and could eventually
supply them Libyan oil.

<HEAD>Three Republicans Trying To Stop Andrus Steamroller</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK WARBIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The three Republicans hoping to oust Gov.
Cecil Andrus are vying for a shot at a Democrat whose popularity in
GOP Idaho is formidable after three terms as governor and four
years in Jimmy Carter's Cabinet.
   Their challenge is further complicated by an economic resurgence
in Idaho reminiscent of the boom times of the 1970s, when Andrus
served his first two terms as governor.
   Challengers looking for a flaw have focused on what they contend
is Andrus' increasingly imperial demeanor, charging he has become
arrogant and out of touch with the people and their needs.
   Andrus, who has no Democratic opposition in Tuesday's primary,
has emphasized the state's accomplishments during his tenure. He
also has tried to counter his opponents' efforts to paint him as
out of touch with Idahoans.
   ``The people of Idaho know me pretty well,'' he said in
announcing his re-election bid. ``They know what I stand for and
what we have accomplished together.''
   Andrus first served as Idaho's governor from 1971 to 1977, when
he began a four-year stint as Carter's Interior secretary. After
several years on the political sidelines, he was elected to his
third term as governor in 1986.
   This year's race for the GOP gubernatorial nomination has been
fraught with personal missteps that have left no clear front-runner
and a sense of frustration among party officials looking toward the
general election.
   In the campaign's closing days, observers saw the potential for
Milton Erhart, a Boise stockbroker and relative political newcomer,
to emerge from the pack, especially if there were a large primary
turnout.
   The other two GOP candidates are Rachel Gilbert, a state senator
and real estate broker, and Roger Fairchild, a former state Senate
majority leader and apple processor.
   Erhart, 49, has stressed his pro-choice stand on abortion as a
fundamental difference between himself and the other Republicans.
   ``I'm right where the people are,'' Erhart said, contending his
opponents represent the more traditional, conservative wing of the
GOP in Idaho.
   ``The party has changed,'' he said. ``It's much more moderate
and much more mainstream. I don't think they represent the majority
of the Republican Party.''
   Erhart's position on abortion could hurt him with GOP primary
voters, but may allow him to undercut what could be a major base of
support for Andrus in November.
   Andrus' pro-choice support is predicated largely on the
governor's March veto of a bill that would have created the
nation's most restrictive state abortion law.
   Anti-abortion forces have targeted Andrus for defeat, but
pro-choice activists have vowed to work just as hard to support him.
   Fairchild, 37, calls himself a ``progressive conservative'' and
has based his candidacy on a commitment to Idaho's infrastructure.
   But his campaign has been plagued by his admitted use of
marijuana as a youth, allegations of abuse from his ex-wife and
what he contends have been misinterpretations of his attempts at
humor on the stump.
   Among them were his declaration that he would have signed the
anti-abortion legislation Andrus vetoed ``in a baby's heartbeat.''
On another occasion, he said, ``You can make love to small animals
or large men, but if you have sex with a woman and get her
pregnant, you have a responsibility.''
   Mrs. Gilbert, 59, has picked up the nickname ``Attila the Hen''
for her caustic debating style in the Idaho Senate. She has made
the image of Andrus as an arrogant, aloof chief executive a
consistent theme of her candidacy.
   Her primary issue has been a call for state tax cuts, which she
pushed unsuccessfully in the 1990 Legislature as it decided how to
spend a $126 million state budget surplus.

<HEAD>Congress Told Ban on South African Diamonds Would Be Futile</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. ban on South African diamonds would be
futile because they can be sold through other countries with false
papers, a congressional study says.
   The General Accounting Office said DeBeers' Central Selling
Organization, the world's main buyer of rough diamonds, has refused
requests from U.S. buyers to identify stones from South Africa.
   DeBeers also mines almost all South African diamonds. Its
stockpile was estimated as worth $3 billion last year.
   Japan spends more on diamond jewelry than any other nation, and
the Japanese buy the choicer kinds. In 1988 they provided 31
percent of the industry's estimated $4.3 billion income.
   The U.S. share of the purchases was only slightly smaller, 30
percent. Americans bought more than twice as many pieces as the
Japanese.
   The GAO, which is the investigative arm of Congress, presented
its report last month to Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., a prominent
advocate of sanctions against South Africa to compel abolition of
race laws there. The report was given to reporters last week.
   It said that to keep prices high, DeBeers sells rough diamonds
only to about 150 buyers, many of them in Antwerp, Belgium. Many of
the diamonds are also cut in Antwerp, and others in New York,
Bombay, India and Tel Aviv.
   The report said DeBeers could sell the rough diamonds in
Antwerp, where false documents could be created for shipments to
this country. It said the Belgian government does not ask importers
where their diamonds came from.
   ``It is likely that a ban on South African diamonds would
encounter widespread evasion through false country of origin
certificates for imported diamonds,'' the GAO said.
   The GA0 quoted an Indian merchant who said traders got around an
Indian government ban against South African diamonds by using such
false certificates. He said DeBeers' shipments to India came with
papers claiming the country of origin was unknown.
   The report suggested that a ban might be easier to enforce
through agreements between the United States and the governments of
countries where most of the cutting is done: Israel, India and
Belgium. Such agreements were made to prevent nickel mined in Cuba
from entering this country.
   It said the agreements would work only if the governments
persuaded DeBeers to separate the stones that come from South
Africa. It added that if DeBeers refused, the cutters might buy
directly from other diamond-producing countries. These include the
Soviet Union, Brazil, Guyana and Venezuela, as well as several
African countries.
   It pointed out that direct sales would loosen DeBeers' control.
   Direct sales could increase the producing countries' profits,
while cutters and consumers could benefit from lower prices, it
added.
   The report also told Kennedy that sanctions in general had
little effect against Namibia in the years before it achieved
independence from South Africa, though it did raise prices for
imported goods. Most of those goods came from or through South
Africa.
   The GAO said now that sanctions have been lifted against
Namibia, it may become a path for avoiding sanctions against South
Africa. They pointed out that Namibia's main port, Walvis Bay,
remains under South African control.
   South African goods could be labeled as coming from Namibia and
imports banned to South Africa could be reshipped from Namibia.
they added.

   Election officials
agreed to review vote totals in the tight presidential race after
challenger Juan Bosch said vote fraud had occurred and threatened
to lead street protests.
   Former President Jimmy Carter, an election observer, helped
persuade Bosch and incumbent President Joaquin Balaguer on Friday
to accept the review, and Bosch called off the planned
demonstrations.
   By noon today, only 90 percent of ballots were counted from
Wednesday's election, the Central Election Board said. Balaguer,
83, a five-time conservative president, clung to a 14,880-vote
lead, the results showed.
   Balaguer had 592,554 votes and Bosch 577,674, with 5,905 of the
6,663 polling stations reporting, official results showed. Jose
Francisco Pena Gomez, a former socialist mayor of Santo Domingo,
was a distant third with 388,315.
   Pena Gomez, a former Bosch protege, was thought to have been
instrumental in getting the agreement for the electoral review. He
had warned Bosch that street demonstrations could lead to a
``bloodbath.''
   Bosch, 80, a former president who was overthrown in a 1963
military coup, has claimed ``colossal fraud,'' a charge that has
not been substantiated.
   Pena Gomez late Friday said there were widespead irregularities,
mainly in the vote count in the capital, Santo Domingo. He did not
elaborate further.
   Carter met with both leading candidates Friday to come up with
the agreement to examine vote totals.
   He told reporters the main presidential candidates approved the
procedure under which copies of tally sheets obtained by political
parties from polling stations will be checked against tallies
received by the electoral board. The process could take several
days.
   ``Any fraud or honest errors will be discovered and resolved,''
said Carter, reading in Spanish from a statement signed by him and
Froilan Tavares, the election board president.
   A Bosch spokesman, Leonel Fernandez, had accused the electoral
board of selectively announcing voter returns to prepare public
opinion for a fraudulent Balaguer victory. Bosch had claimed before
the election that Balaguer had 300,000 fake ballots to rig the
election, an accusation Balaguer denied.
   Carter, one of 30 international election observers, said that
neither Bosch ``nor any of the candidates presented to me any
evidence of fraud.''
   The election is Carter's third in Latin America in a year. He
presided over election monitoring efforts in the May 1989 vote in
Panama and the Feb. 25 balloting in Nicaragua, in which voters
ousted the Sandinistas from power.
   Balaguer and Bosch were locked in their fifth race for the
presidency of this Caribbean nation of 7 million people. Balaguer
won three of the four previous races.
   An army intelligence agent was beaten Friday outside the
headquarters of Bosch's Dominican Liberation Party, where about 200
supporters had gathered to greet the candidate. The party's vice
president, Elfidio Baez, said the agent pulled a gun on Bosch, but
the army denied it.
   Bosch, who describes himself as a Marxist but not a Communist,
campaigned on a moderate platform, promoting free-enterprise
solutions to the country's serious economic problems.
   Balaguer, now blind from glaucoma, was first elected president
in 1966 and served three consecutive four-year terms before losing
in 1978. He was re-elected in 1986.
   Balaguer has sought to capitalize on a $2 billion public-works
project that has created thousands of new jobs. But the project has
fueled inflation and the country is plagued by electricity
blackouts and water shortages.

   For black teen-ager Yusuf Hawkins, the
Bensonhurst neighborhood of Brooklyn was an ugly place where he was
killed by an angry white mob.
   For Sharon Woolard, who also is black, Bensonhurst is a pleasant
place where whites welcomed her with gifts of vegetables just a
week before Hawkins was killed around the corner from her apartment.
   So when she heard that neighbor Keith Mondello had been found
innocent Friday of murder charges in Hawkins' death, she smiled.
   ``That's all I wanted to know. He's a nice kid. My son loves
him. He always plays with him,'' Ms. Woolard said.
   Mondello, 19, was found guilty of lesser charges. A day earlier,
co-defendant Joseph Fama, 19, was convicted of second-degree murder.
   For residents, inconsistencies between the Hawkins case and the
way they see new residents such as Woolard treated are enough to
convince them Bensonhurst is painted with too wide a brush when it
is called racist.
   Decades ago, Bensonhurst, a south Brooklyn neighborhood of
modest rowhouses and small apartment buildings, was exclusively
populated by whites. But that has changed in the past decade.
   ``It's a melting pot here,'' said Lisa Galarza, who is Puerto
Rican. She also lives on the same block as Mondello and around the
corner from where Hawkins died.
   ``Bensonhurst isn't predominantly white. It's a shame
Bensonhurst got a bad name because it's a nice place to raise
kids,'' she said.
   Her neighbors, she added, include Asians, blacks, Colombians,
Arabs and Jews, just to name a few.
   ``They're labeling the whole neighborhood as racist,'' said Jay
Shah, 33, an immigrant from India who moved to Bensonhurst two
years ago. ``I don't think that's right.''
   ``People who don't live here have a misconception about this
whole Bensonhurst neighborhood. They think it's unsafe for
non-whites to come here,'' he said.
   Maria Gonzalez, 25, a Hispanic woman who moved to Bensonhurst
two years ago, said she considers Mondello and the others to be
friends and likes that they sometimes play with her 2-year-old son.
   ``They love him and he's half black,'' she said. ``They play
ball with him. If these people were racists, I wouldn't live in
this neighborhood.''
   Prosecutors say Hawkins was killed last August by a mob of
whites, armed with baseball bats and a gun, who mistook Hawkins and
his three friends for blacks who they thought were coming to the
neighborhood to fight.
   ``The guy was in the wrong place at the wrong time,'' Ms.
Gonzalez said.
   Bensonhurst, like many other New York neighborhoods, is a place
where children sometimes grow up too quickly.
   Some youngsters use profanity freely in the calmest of
conversations and are quick to take on any challenge.
   On Friday, a 10-year-old boy became angry at two other boys of
about the same age and stood on his porch with a beer bottle. He
smashed the bottle against a wall and a porch railing, then threw
the pieces at the other boys. They laughed, and were not hit.
   Then the boy on the porch took a 4-foot stick and chased the
others down the street.
   ``C'mon over here children,'' he taunted them.
   ``I don't come to dogs. Dogs come to me,'' one of the boys
answered.
   Emilio Dellosso, 58, said youths in Bensonhurst have always
protected their turf and sometimes armed themselves with bats, but
said it was never racially motivated.
   He called Bensonhurst ``one of the best neighborhoods you can
live in.''
   ``Why do they knock the whole neighborhood?'' he asked. ``It's
ridiculous.''
   Ms. Woolard said she will continue to live in Bensonhurst with
her 1-year-old daughter and 15-year-old son.
   She recalled fondly the day shortly after she moved in when two
Italian neighbors brought her vegetables as a welcome gift.
   ``I loved the neighborhood,'' she said. ``I was welcomed with
open arms.''

<HEAD>Space Telescope To Take `First Light' Photo</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Hubble Space Telescope, the most powerful
astronomical observatory ever lofted into orbit, takes its first
picture of the heavens Sunday.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration announced
Saturday that engineers had completed the early part of an
elaborate checkout of the $1.5 billion telescope and would open a
shutter on one of its cameras on Sunday for a wide-angle photo of a
distant cluster of stars.
   Traditionally, a new telescope's initial glimpse of the heavens
is called ``the first light.'' For Hubble, the first light will
have traveled across space for more than 12 centuries before
reaching the orbiting telescope.
   Engineers expect to receive the photo on the ground at 1:49 p.m.
EDT and release prints at the Goddard Space Flight Center in
Maryland.
   Space officials warned that the first effort will not represent
the telescope's best work. Nor will the photo have any great
scientific value. But ``first light'' will mark completion of weeks
of work by engineers to test, focus and align the 25,000-pound
telescope.
   ``We will consider it a total success if the first picture that
comes down is as good as a ground-based exposure,'' said Ed Weiler,
NASA's space telescope program scientist. ``You'll hear a lot of
cheering when that happens.''
   Weiler said the only real value of the first light photo is as
``a useful engineering test.''
   ``I guess to the public it has become an historic event,'' he
said in an interview Friday. ``We will probably not learn anything
of scientific value because the telescope is not performing
anywhere near its eventual value.''
   NASA engineers believe that Hubble, with its 94.5-inch diameter
mirror and powerful light-amplifying and focusing equipment,
eventually will take photos of stars that are 25 times fainter than
the dimmest object visible from Earth. Pictures from Hubble are
expected to have 10 times the clarity of photos taken by the most
powerful ground-based telescopes.
   Testing and tuneup of the telescope are expected to continue for
another seven months or so. Only then will Hubble begin what
experts believe will be a 15-year mission of astronomical
exploration and scientific discovery.
   Hubble was carried into space last month by space shuttle
Discovery. On April 25, it was plucked from the shuttle's cargo bay
and left to orbit on its own, 381 miles above the Earth.
   From this vantage point, the telescope is above the Earth's
atmosphere, which obscures the stellar view for instruments on the
ground. Astronomers expect the Hubble will be able to study stars
at the depths of the universe some 14 billion light years away.
   The telescope engineering checkout encountered a series of
difficulties _ including a still-unsolved jitter _ that delayed the
first light picture for weeks.
   Jean Olivier, a Marshall Space Flight Center engineer and deputy
director of the Hubble orbital checkout, said the telescope's
jitter, or oscillation, will be solved soon.
   ``It's just considered a headache,'' he said. ``We know with the
activities coming up in the next few weeks we will have it under
control.''
   Hubble's first light picture will be a one second exposure of a
star cluster called Theta Carina. The target can be seen only south
of the equator and is part of a constellation called Carina, a word
that means ``ship's keel.''
   The star cluster, identified in the New General Catalogue of
stars as 3532, is thought to be 3 billion years old. Its distance
from Earth is about 1,260 light years, or 7,400,000,000,000,000
miles.
   A wide field camera, one of five instruments in the telescope,
will capture the image and store it in a tape recorder on board. It
will be sent, in the form of electronic bits, through a relay
satellite to the Goddard Space Flight Center.
   Computers at Goddard will assemble a picture from the electronic
bits, take out any stray background signals, and send a visual
image to a screen.
   And astronomers of today will then be able to analyze light that
erupted from Theta Carina in about the year 730 A.D., more than
eight centuries before the first telescope was invented.

<HEAD>Trial Shows Conflict Between Religious Freedom, Child Protection</HEAD>

   David and Ginger Twitchell have held hands and
listened while prosecutors press their claim that the Christian
Science couple recklessly caused their 2{-year-old son's death by
withholding medical treatment.
   The trial is being closely watched by the Christian Science
Church, based in Boston, and by others who say it represents a
conflict between religious freedom and child protection.
   Four years ago, Robyn Twitchell died in the Twitchells' Hyde
Park home after five days of illness. An autopsy revealed the boy
had a birth defect, called Meckel's diverticulum, which caused a
blockage in his bowel. Two years later, manslaughter charges were
filed against the parents.
   What is at issue in the trial is whether the parents, both
longtime Christian Scientists, acted recklessly in relying solely
on prayer to heal the boy.
   Christian Scientists believe that physical disease and sin can
be healed by spiritual means alone. Church members may seek out
special Christian Science practitioners for help in praying for
health.
   The Twitchells' response to their child's suffering has become
one of the early issues in their complicated manslaughter trial,
which enters its third week of testimony Monday.
   Special Prosecutor John Kiernan has asked several witnesses
about Twitchell's demeanor when his son was dying, and some have
testified that he was expressionless.
   Under questioning, witnesses also have said that Mrs. Twitchell
wears glasses and that her husband sought dental treatment for
himself.
   In often stomach-churning detail, prosecution witnesses have
described what Robyn might have felt during his last day, from
agonizing pain to frequent vomiting. Medical experts have also
testified the boy's life could have been saved by medical
intervention, almost up until the end.
   In cross-examination, defense attorneys Rikki Klieman and
Stephen Lyons have hammered at the prosecution's medical experts in
efforts to prove that medical science is not exact, and that a
doctor could not have guaranteed Robyn's life.
   They have sought to show that Robyn's symptoms resembled the flu
and that he died suddenly while cradled in his father's arms. On
the day of his death, ``it appeared to one and all there was
nothing seriously wrong with this child,'' Klieman said.
   Christian Science practitioner Nancy Calkins, who treated Robyn
with prayer, testified that the boy was playing with the family cat
less than an hour before his death.
   ``I think that's pure fantasy,'' Dr. William Hardy Hendren
testified as a medical expert. He is chief of surgery at Boston's
Children's Hospital.
   Church officials say Christian Science itself is on trial.
Klieman has moved for a mistrial, arguing that the prosecution's
questions were improperly aimed at analyzing religious doctrine.
   Kiernan has said the state is not challenging the Christian
Science faith, but attempting to protect children who are too young
to make religious decisions for themselves. ``I applaud
enthusiastically the value and use of spiritual healing. It is the
exclusion of medical science that creates the problem,'' he said.
   Kiernan closely questioned Calkins about the role of prayer in
healing, often citing quotations from Mary Baker Eddy, who founded
Christian Science more than a century ago, seeking to show church
members can seek medical help without being excommunicated or
ostracized.
   Asked to explain what she did for church members, she said: ``If
they're in pain, I just take up the work. If they want Christian
Science help for a stubbed toe or a severed hand, they will have it
from me. Truth will heal a stubbed toe or a severed arm.''
   Klieman said Kiernan's questions took Mrs. Eddy's teachings out
of context. ``The central core of Christian Science is spiritual
healing,'' she said. The church ``is not some fringe, cult group.
It is been an established church for 100 years.''
   The courtroom has been packed for nearly every session,
attracting church officials and Rita Swan, a former Christian
Scientist and the founder of CHILD, a Iowa-based group that seeks
prosecution of parents who withhold medical treatment of children
for religious reasons.

   Days after Hurricane Hugo smashed into
this city, a banner appeared on the side of a pastel building on
the edge of Calhoun Square.
   ``The opera ain't over 'till the fat lady sings,'' it said.
``And we're not going to let her sing.''
   The banner, which remains until this day, reflects the spirit of
this city as well as of the organizers of Spoleto Festival U.S.A.
   As if to prove Charleston has recovered from the ravages of the
storm, the curtain rises this week on the most ambitious Spoleto in
the 14-year history of the American arts festival.
   ``The storm has not been able to allay the enthusiasm about the
festival,'' which is keeping pace with last year's record box
office, general manager Nigel Redden said.
   The Sept. 21 hurricane, which packed 135 mph winds and a 12-foot
tidal surge, damaged hundreds of buildings, tore off roofs and
toppled trees throughout the area. Repairs have been made and the
historic district, where the festival events are staged, has been
cleaned.
   The festival, which opens Friday and runs through June 10,
features more than 110 performances offering a little bit of
everything from grand opera to multimedia events and some old
favorites.
   The festival was brought to Charleston in 1977 by composer Gian
Carlo Menotti. He founded the Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto,
Italy, in 1957 with the aim of merging the cultural worlds of
Europe and America.
   In a departure from tradition, the first major event of the U.S.
festival this year is not an opera, but a gala concert to celebrate
the hurricane recovery.
   The Friday evening event, which has been sold out for weeks,
will feature Beethoven's Symphony No. 7 and will be conducted by
Leonard Bernstein.
   One of the most extravagant events at this year's festival will
be a five-hour production of Richard Wagner's opera ``Parsifal''
directed by Menotti.
   The production, which will be staged twice during the festival,
begins in the late afternoon and features a dinner break where
operagoers will be able to eat in a medieval setting.
   ``It's one of the great masterpieces of theatrical repertory,''
Menotti said. ``It's a very exciting theatrical experience _
exciting not only because it's full of magic, it's full of
theatrical tricks.''
   The Pulitzer Prize-winning Menotti also will direct a revival of
last year's hit, ``The Marriage of Figaro.'' This season's version
will be staged with a new cast and the sets have been redesigned
because the old ones were damaged in the hurricane.
   National publicity about Charleston after the hurricane may be
helping the box office, said festival spokeswoman Ann Wilson.
Ticket sales are ``running neck and neck or a little better'' than
last year when a record $1.48 million in tickets were sold.
   ``The media attention seems to be focused a bit more heavily on
the festival this year,'' she said. ``I have newspapers coming to
cover the festival who have not been for some time. I think that's
one of the positive spinoffs of the hurricane.''
   ``I hope it's going to show everybody that Charleston is fine
and you can still come and it's still pretty, and all the buildings
aren't lying in a heap in the streets.''

<HEAD>On 100th Anniversary of Ho Chi Minh's Birth, Vietnam Looks Back</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam on Saturday celebrated the
centenary of the birth of Ho Chi Minh, the frail-looking
revolutionary who spurred a ragtag army to victory over the forces
of France and the United States.
   Although he died before the war ended in 1975, ``Uncle Ho,'' who
preached a blend of Confucianism and communism, was the driving
force behind Hanoi's war effort.
   But Ho's hopes for a peaceful and prosperous postwar state were
never realized. The country today faces growing economic woes,
political isolation and the continuing war in neighboring Cambodia
sparked by Vietnam's 1978 invasion.
   The official Voice of Vietnam radio devoted a half-hour tribute
to Ho on the 100th anniversary of his birth, playing music
dedicated to the ``great national hero.''
   It aired a recording of Ho's declaration of the founding of
Communist North Vietnam in September 1945, which the radio called
the most emotional moment in his life.
   Nationwide celebrations Saturday included cultural festivals,
parades, mass meetings and the unveiling of memorials to Ho, the
official media said.
   Western analysts have pointed to the darker side of Ho's
leadership, including the land reform program in the 1950s in which
up to 50,000 people died.
   But in Vietnam, any public criticism of Ho is unlikely.
Dissenters are virtually without voice.
   An American who was recently held in Vietnam for alleged
anti-government activities said security officials anticipated
possible trouble on the anniversary and were arresting dissidents
in Saigon, the former South Vietnamese capital. It was renamed Ho
Chi Minh City by the Communists.
   Born in Nghe An in central Vietnam in 1890, Ho was the son of a
poor but educated father who schooled him in Confucian philosophy
and patriotism.
   Ho went to Paris as a student in the early 1920s and was caught
up in radical politics. With Lenin's work as his inspiration, he
vowed to fight to liberate Vietnam from French colonialists.
   He founded the Indochinese Communist Party in 1930, and was
tutored by both Soviet and Chinese Communists. In 1941 he found the
Vietminh front, the backbone of the guerrilla insurgency that
defeated the French in 1954 and the U.S.-backed South Vietnam
government in 1975.
   Both the French and the Americans found him a brilliant
strategist and a ruthless, relentless opponent.
   ``The war may last five years, 10 or 20 years,'' he said before
his death in September 1969. ``Hanoi, Haiphong and a number of
municipalities and enterprises may be destroyed, but the Vietnamese
people are not afraid.''
   ``When we achieve victory,'' he boasted, ``the Vietnamese people
will build their country bigger and more beautiful.''
   But today the official Vietnam media almost daily bemoan the
corruption, food shortages and crumbling state enterprises.
   And the country's isolation is growing, despite a troop pullout
from Cambodia last year that eased some of the concerns of the
West. Its traditional allies, the Soviet Union and the Eastern
Europe countries, have significantly reduced aid.
   In recent months, Vietnam, with its continued hard-line
adherence to socialism, found itself out of step with the
democratic changes elsewhere.
   In a gathering in Hanoi to mark the Ho centenary, Vietnam's
Communist Party chief Nguyen Van Linh insisted Friday that the
country would continue to adhere to Ho's objectives.
   ``Despite the current serious challenges, socialism is bound to
overcome immediate difficulties and prevail,'' the official Vietnam
News Agency quoted him as saying.
   The report, seen here Saturday, said senior representatives from
the Soviet Union, Laos, Cambodia and India attended the gathering.
India is the only major non-Communist country friendly to Hanoi.
   ``On this solemn occasion, our entire party and people further
reaffirm the determination forever to follow the path that
President Ho Chi Minh has chosen,'' said Linh, whose 3-year-old
administration has made Western-style economic changes but avoided
substantial political ones.
   A U.S. private humanitarian agency, the International Mission of
Hope, said it, too, had plans to commmemorate the anniversary of
Ho's birth. It was opening a health clinic Saturday at the wartime
massacre site of My Lai village.

<HEAD>Mother Still Writes Letters to Son Killed in Vietnam</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eleanor Wimbish dutifully writes her eldest
son four times a year. But she never mails the letters.
   She leaves them beneath panel No. 32 of the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial, where her son's name is permanently engraved in black
granite.
   Wimbish, a 63-year-old great grandmother from Glen Burnie, Md.,
began writing the unmailed letters to her son, William Reed
``Spanky'' Stocks, after he was killed in a helicopter crash in
Vietnam on Feb. 13, 1969, For years, she told no one of the letters
she wrote in the wee hours of the morning to comfort herself.
   But in recent years her letters have been published in numerous
books and magazines. Next week, one of the letters will be read
during public television's live Memorial Day evening broadcast of a
National Symphony concert on the U.S. Capitol grounds.
   In the letters, Wimbish often discusses childhood memories of
her son and the kindnesses his fellow military buddies have shown
her through the years.
   ``This (writing) is my way of coping with the pain,'' Wimbish
said after leaving a letter at the Memorial earlier this month, on
what would have been Stocks' 43rd birthday. ``My son warmed his way
into everyone's heart. He was very special.''
   Stocks, nicknamed ``Spanky'' by his comrades in Vietnam, died at
age 21. The blades of his helicopter cut into the aircraft, leaving
Stocks severely injured. He died about half an hour later.
   His body was returned to the United States in a glass-covered
casket. Wimbish explained that all bodies deemed viewable were
placed in such caskets.
   ``I didn't have to wonder like others who only got pieces
back,'' Wimbish said, clutching her handbag and fighting back tears
during a recent interview. ``I hope you know I'm going to go home
and bawl like crazy. But that's OK. It's worth it. It's worth it
for people to know.''
   An estimated 200,000 people are expected to gather on the West
Lawn of the U.S. Capitol on May 27. The 90-minute TV special will
feature actress Colleen Dewhurst, who will read the letter, in
addition to appearances by actor James Earl Jones and singer
Rosemary Clooney, who will perform with the National Symphony.
   ``Memorial Day is a time for all Americans to honor the memory
of those who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country,'' said
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash. ``This televised event will
allow Americans everywhere to share in this important holiday.''
   Foley is scheduled to appear at the event with House Minority
Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill.
   The letter to be read was written six years ago.
   ``Today is Feb. 13, 1984. I came to this black wall again to see
and touch your name, and as I do, I wonder if anyone ever stops to
realize that next to your name, on this black wall, is your
mother's heart. A heart broken 15 years ago today, when you lost
your life in Vietnam,'' Wimbish wrote.
   ``When my son died, I wrote my pledge,'' Wimbish said. ``I said
I will not now or ever let people forget.''

   A reputed top member of the Medellin drug
cartel was convicted today of two counts of drug conspiracy.
   Jose Abello-Silva, who was extradited from Colombia last fall,
was convicted on federal counts of conspiracy to import drugs into
the United States and conspiracy to possess drugs with intent to
distribute.
   Prosecutors alleged Abello was a ranking member of the Medellin
drug cartel and one of the top drug offenders brought to the United
States under a new extradition treaty with Colombia.
   He faces up to $8 million in fines and up to 30 years in prison.
   Jurors, whose identities were withheld for security reasons,
returned the verdicts 45 minutes after convening today. They had
deliberated since Thursday.
   Many jurors clenched their fists and wrung their fingers while
the foreman, identified only as Juror No. 7, read the guilty
verdicts.
   Defense attorney Richard Haynes, who was given until June 1 to
file an appeal, and fellow defense attorney Patrick Williams said
they met with Abello following the verdict.
   ``I had a very emotional conference with our client,'' Williams
said. ``I told him what we're going to do. He's emotional. He's
hurt. I imagine he's just a little bit frightened that so much is
going on that he doesn't know about.
   ``As he looked up at us, he said, `It just isn't fair. It just
isn't fair.'''
   U.S. Attorney Tony Graham called the verdict a thoughtful one
and praised jurors and authorities for their efforts.
   Abello was indicted in Tulsa in 1987 and was extradited Oct. 29
from Bogota, Colombia.
   Abello was tried here because of phone calls and money exchanges
between groups in Tulsa and Florida that allegedly helped raise
money for a man who was jailed in Tulsa at the time.
   Graham said some proceeds from a cocaine shipment were to have
been used to raise money for the man. A plot to ship a quantity of
cocaine for that purpose never was carried out.
   Prosecutors called 23 witnesses over five weeks.
   Among the evidence was a recording secretly made by an FBI
informant during a meeting in Florida of a confessed smuggler
discussing plans he had made with Abello in Aruba to import cocaine.
   Prosecutors contend Abello and the smuggler agreed at the
meeting in Aruba to ship 500 kilograms _ more than half a ton _ of
cocaine into the United States.
   Abello has admitted attending the meeting but said he stormed
out of the room when the conversation turned to drugs.

<HEAD>Communist Rebels Denounce Decision to Proceed With Bases Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist rebels on Saturday
denounced the government's decision to continue talks on the future
of U.S. military bases as an affront to national sovereignty and
vowed to intensify their struggle.
   Also Saturday, Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said the
Philippines must prepare for the possibility the bases will close
and appealed for greater military cooperation among non-Communist
nations of Southeast Asia.
   The executive committee of the banned Communist Party of the
Philippines issued the condemnation one day after Philippine
officials accepted U.S. promises to work for increased aid and
agreed to further talks on extending the bases after the lease
expires next year.
   In the statement, the rebels urged a ``struggle to stop the
latest sellout of the national sovereignty in exchange for the
right price.''
   It vowed to fight to prevent ``the U.S. imperialists,'' the
government of President Corazon Aquino ``and other local traitors''
from reaching an accord on the bases.
   Five days of preliminary talks on the bases ended Friday with
the two sides agreeing to continue negotiations but setting no date
for the next round.
   The talks are to determine whether the United States can
continue using Clark Air Base, the Subic Bay naval base and four
smaller installations after the current agreement expires on Sept.
16, 1991.
   A week ago, on the eve of the talks, Communist rebels killed two
American airmen near Clark and threatened further attacks on
Americans until all 40,000 U.S. troops, Defense Department
civilians and military dependents leave the Philippines.
   A regional military commander said Friday that troops had
arrested three suspected members of the Marxist New People's Army,
one of whom may have been involved in the killing of the two
Americans.
   In Washington, the Pentagon announced Friday that U.S. military
and Defense Department civilian personnel in the Philippines will
get pay increases because of ``unstable conditions'' here.
   The imminent danger pay amounts to a 15 percent increase in the
basic salary for civilian employees and $110 per month extra for
all military personnel, the statement said.
   In a speech Saturday to graduates of the military's Command and
General Staff College, Ramos said removal of the American bases
would force members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
to increase defense spending.
   The association, or ASEAN, includes Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia,
the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.
   ``It would be reasonable to expect that the closure of the bases
will result in ASEAN countries doubling their efforts to protect
their own interests,'' Ramos said.
   Ramos said that even if a new bases agreement can be reached,
``the U.S. facilities cannot permanently remain as a fixture of our
national territory.''
   ``The wisdom of pursuing a self-reliant defense posture is
self-evident,'' he said.

   President Bush said today there are encouraging
developments from U.S.-Soviet arms talks in Moscow but ``some
problems still remain to be solved.''
   ``It's a mixed review right now,'' the president told reporters
when asked if he had an update from Secretary of State James A.
Baker III on his talks with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   Bush made his comments before heading off to inspect flood
damage in Texas on a four-day western trip.
   He spoke after Baker told a news conference in Moscow that ``a
trail-blazing agreement'' on U.S.-Soviet agreement to ban
superpower production of chemical weapons would be signed at the
Washington summit at the end of the month.
   Baker said the two sides have also resolved major disputes on
cutting their strategic nuclear arms. He acknowledged failure to
bride differences on reducing troops and tanks in Europe but
otherwise gave a positive account of the talks.
   Bush said he and his National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft
had just been discussing the latest developments.
   ``It's interesting developments,'' he said. ``We're not sure we
know all of it yet. It's encouraging.''
   He added, ``Some problems still remain to be solved.''
   Bush arrived in Texas on Friday and expressed astonishment and
sadness at the damage wrought by the Trinity River, whose
overflowing window-level waters forced residents from their homes.
   ``There's some sadness involved in this homecoming,'' the
president said after arriving in his adopted home state for a
political event and a commencement speech.
   He said that looking out the windows of Air Force One, he and
his wife Barbara ``were astounded we could only see the tops of
some trees where the Trinity's overflowed'' in the state where the
couple arrived to start a new life 42 years ago.
   Bush made the comments in addressing a Dallas fund-raising
dinner for the state Republican Party before flying to Houston to
spend Friday night.
   Bush on Saturday visited the Livingston Dam region where Lake
Livingston and the Trinity River had swollen out of their banks,
engulfing forests and homes in the rural area 75 miles northeast of
Houston.
   After flying over the region by helicopter, Bush talked with
local flood workers and surveyed the surging waters beneath the
dam, which submerged a recreation and boat launching area.
   Bush greeted several dozen onlookers and commented that
``fortunately it isn't a highly concentrated residential area _ it
isn't like a city is under water.''
   Noting the emergency assistance available through the Federal
Emergency Managment Agency, he said, ``The federal government wants
to be very responsive.'' Bush then flew by helicopter to the
Deerwood County Club outside Houston to participate in the Doug
Sanders Celebrity Golf Tournament with his son George Bush, a part
owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team.
   Also playing were two former astronauts, Alan Shepard and Eugene
A. Cernan.
   Hundreds of people crowded the course to applaud the president.
   The president declared a federal disaster in Texas on May 3.
Thirty-eight counties have been included in the region eligible for
federal disaster loans and grants.
   Flooding has caused at least 13 deaths in Texas as dozens of
square miles have been inundated.
   Bush said Friday night that, ``The losses have been heavy, but
one thing that comes through to me from talking to my friends is
that this state will never lose its soul,'' he said. He lauded
``the indomitable spirit'' of Texans.
   The president was completing his day by addressing evening
commencement ceremonies at the University of Texas in Austin.
   Bush arrived in Texas on Friday for a $1.5 million fund-raising
reception and dinner to benefit the state Republican Party.
   Party faithful who paid $25,000 a couple got to mingle with Bush
at a private reception, while others bought $5,000 and $1,000
tickets for the dinner.
   Attending Friday's events was the flamboyant Republican
gubernatorial candidate, Clayton Williams.
   Williams, an oil millionaire whose campaign has been marked by a
series of controversial statements about women, maintains a
double-digit lead over Democratic rival Ann Richards, according to
a recent GOP poll.
   But neither side has introduced any television commercials for
the November election, and both are concentrating on fund-raising
at this stage.
   Bush said Williams ``will bring his own energetic style to the
governor's office and stamp his brand of leadership on the Texas of
the 90s.''
   He said Texas Republicans ``are blowing away the stuffiness of
irrelevant liberalism, because your new breeze carries the new
ideas Texas need for the '90s. Ideas that encourage investment in
business and in the business of our children _ education.''

<TEXT>
   The Mormon Church rejected polygamy 100
years ago under federal pressure and still excommunicates known
polygamists, but the state ignores the practice that a historian
says is ``healthy and alive and well.''
   Practitioners defend polygamy and its roots in Mormon
fundamentalism, and have forged alliances they say are stronger
than ever before.
   ``They have to make more sacrifices and learn more about their
beliefs to sustain a defense than anyone else does,'' said Ogden
Kraut, a polygamist with five wives said in a telephone interview
last week.
   ``And in doing so, they become stronger in their convictions,''
he said. ''I think it's more rooted in now than it ever was.''
   With roughly 30,000 men, women and children living in polygamy
communities, the practice is ``healthy and alive and well _ and
it's everywhere,'' said historian Martha Sonntag Bradley.
   She estimates the polygamist community is doubling every decade,
both from the birthrate and conversion.
   This year marks the 100th anniversary of the ``Manifesto,'' in
which church President Wilford Woodruff advised the faithful to
abandon the practice of men taking multiple wives, a practice
introduced by church founder Joseph Smith.
   The federal government had threatened to seize church property
in the Utah Territory if the Mormons failed to observe
anti-polygamy laws. Woodruff feared continuing the practice would
imperil the Mormons' hopes for statehood.
   From then until now, staunch believers have rejected the
decision to remove polygamy from the doctrines of the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
   It is a stance that has driven many Mormon fundamentalists, to
remote enclaves in Utah, Idaho, Montana, Arizona and Mexico.
   Others have kept their beliefs and actions secret.
   ``If you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and believe that the
prophet Joseph Smith was his representative on earth, how in the
world can you go around saying we have to correct their mistakes?
This we cannot do,'' said Owen Allred, leader of the Salt Lake
City-based Apostolic United Brethren, one of the largest
fundamentalist groups.
   Allred's followers and the 5,000 residents of the adjoining
towns of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Ariz., prefer a communal
setting apart from the modern world.
   ``We know, even according to Christ himself, that if you're
friends with the world, you're the enemy of God,'' Allred said.
``Now that's the main point, to be in harmony with the world. We
don't believe in it, and we suffer the consequences.''
   For Cyril Bradshaw, 67, of Colorado City, polygamy has survived
not only through faith, but because ``men have done it very
secretly.''
   ``Men have taken plural wives and kept them in their homes ...
and different places because it's a requirement of the Lord,'' said
Bradshaw, the father of 23 children.
   At one time, polygamists were hunted down and jailed for
flouting laws against cohabitation. Utah authorities haven't
undertaken any such raids since the 1950s. Today, they ignore the
practice.
   Utah Attorney General Paul Van Dam said prosecution isn't worth
it.
   ``When you consider the difficulty of prosecution, the social
disruption, and the constitutional considerations (of freedom of
religion), it all adds to an allocation of resources that many of
us feel would literally deplete our ability to prosecute more
harmful crimes,'' he said.
   In fact, most agree that violence by splinter groups have
corroded the public's image of polygamy far more than the
lifestyles of otherwise law-abiding believers.
   Indeed, Allred said the real threat to polygamy is the Mormon
Church, which he contends would ``cover us in dirt'' for refusing
to adhere to modern interpretations of church doctrines.

<HEAD>Report: Honecker Once Planned Internment Camps for Opponents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 10 years ago, East Germany's
hard-line Communist government proposed building internment camps
to lock up thousands of its opponents, a newspaper said Saturday.
   The reported plan to stamp out the first signs of a grassroots
opposition was never carried out, and on Oct. 18, 1989, a surging
pro-democracy movement drove Erich Honecker and his Communist
regime from power.
   Since Honecker's downfall, there have been numerous accounts of
how he tried to curb growing dissent. Some of those reports said
Honecker intended to lock up opponents last year as the pressure on
his tottering regime mounted.
   In the latest report, the East German newspaper Der Morgen said
Honecker's aides started planning internment camps much earlier,
during the late 1970s, as the fledgling opposition movement was
just beginning.
   The internment camps would have marked a major change for
Honecker, who imprisoned hundreds of activists during his regime
but never rounded up opponents en masse and shipped them to a gulag.
   The subject of such camps is sensitive in a country still
saddled with the murderous legacy of the Nazi death camps and
concentration camps.
   Der Morgen said it had obtained ``extensive proof in the form of
numerous secret papers'' that the once-dreaded secret police were
behind the plot. ``The Ministry for State Security had plans ready
since the late 1970s for internment camps for opponents of the
system and opposition figures,'' the newspaper said.
   Der Morgen is published by the Liberal Party, once a puppet of
the East German Communist regime and now an independent party that
plays only a negligible role in the country's politics.
   ``From the documents for the period from 1979 to 1989, it is
clear to see with what precision and disrespect for human rights
principles the internment was planned,'' the daily newspaper said
in its Saturday editions.
   The newspaper said one of the camps was planned for 1,500 people
near the town of Gotha in the far southwestern part of the country.
Der Morgen ran two pictures of a cluster of a buildings targeted as
the site.
   Another camp was planned for the southern city of Erfurt in
1984, according to Der Morgen. It did not specify other sites, but
said that all together thousands of people were to be interned.
   ``The camps were intended for members of the human rights, peace
and environmental movements, for democratic socialists,
representatives of church groups and those wishing to leave,'' the
newspaper said.
   By last year, those categories included a sizeable portion of
the entire population of 16.6 million people.
   The now-disbanded secret police, the Stasi, had a massive
network of spies and informers to single out anyone opposed to the
hard-line system.
   Opposition boiled over early in October during the visit of
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to East Berlin.
   At that time, police beat protesters with clubs in a futile
attempt to crush the pro-democracy movement.
   Less than two weeks later, Honecker and his hard-line cronies
had been ousted in a move that paved the way for democratic
elections on March 18.

   After more than a quarter century with two
wives, Don Cox no longer sees polygamy as the only road to heaven.
He ahd his wives hope their children will have more sense than to
share a spouse.
   ``I don't feel like there are many advantages,'' said Earlene
Cox, Don's first wife. ``If you had asked me seven years ago, when
I believed that my salvation depended on my living like this, then
my answer might have been different.''
   Cox, 57, is an electrical contractor who grows bedding plants to
help support his wives and 19 children. He thinks having more than
one adult at home may be the only advantage to plural marriage.
   ``Like, when we make trips to deliver plants, there is always
someone in the home,'' he said.
   But Earlene, the 54-year-old mother of 11 of the Cox children,
said the lifestyle is an unrelenting emotional struggle.
   ``It gets plain complicated and it's a challenge,'' she said.
``Another wife comes in and wants to do it her way and it's
continual give and take.''
   Don and Earlene were married in 1953. In 1962, he took a second
wife, Katy, who is 50. The three have lived in Colorado City for 22
years.
   While the Mormon Church abandoned polygamy in 1890 in exchange
for Utah statehood, thousands of fundamentalists continue the
practice, believing it remains a commandment essential for a
person's eternal welfare.
   The Coxes are one of a handful of families in the adjacent
polygamist communities of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Ariz.,
who have severed their their association with the Fundamentalist
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which is not part of
the Mormon Church.
   They are among 30 people who have sued in a federal court,
claiming the sect leaders who govern the towns' 5,000 inhabitants
are illegally holding property belonging to church members.
   Earlene and Katy, who are often mistaken for sisters, have shed
the faith's traditional long skirts and hair in favor of blue jeans
and shorter hairstyles.
   ``We both decided it's not how you look on the outside, but what
you are on the inside that matters,'' Earlene said.
   The Cox mothers are encouraging their two 17-year-old daughters
not to marry into polygamy. Several of their older children are
married, and thus far each has only one spouse.
   ``It's too hard of a lifestyle,'' said Earlene.
   Sometimes the three parents disagree about how to raise the
children. And Don said that even though he tries to be impartial
with his affection for his wives, it sometimes seems impossible.
   ``It's hard when one person perceives something that really
might not be happening,'' Don said. Life with two women is ``just
plain complicated.''
   Nevertheless, the three have no plans to break up a relationship
that has outlived its origins in religious belief.
   ``Oh yeah, we will stick it out,'' Earlene said. ``I mean, we
have raised these kids together.''

   DEARBORN, Mich. _ Alex Cameron props his feet up on the porch
rail every day and says strange words like phrenicectomy to nobody
in particular.
   The linguistics professor from the University of Dayton in Ohio
is preparing for his 10th year as the pronouncer at the May 30-31
Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee in Washington.
   ``There's a big push on a return to basics,'' Cameron said
Saturday at his sister's house in this Detroit suburb, where he is
spending the month. ``People are trying to call attention to those
kinds of skills.''
   Three researchers put together in November a list of 1,000 words
for the bee, at which 220 students from across the United States
will compete. Cameron, using Webster's Third New International
Dictionary, researches definitions, pronunciations, roots and
homonyms for the words.
   Phrenicectomy, which means removal of a nerve in the diaphragm,
was a word in the bee a few years ago, he said. He said he didn't
remember if anyone got it right.
   Cameron whipped out a few words he considered tricky to say and
spell. He said some contestants were stumped by the word acalculia,
which means the lack or loss of ability to perform simple or
arithmetical tasks.
   ``It's a strange feeling to see these kids hanging around the
lobby with their parents, and they're perfectly normal little
kids,'' Cameron said. ``You don't expect them to be able to stand
in front of a bank of network news cameras and work their ways
through words.''
   ``You see them pause, and they're just plain figuring it out up
there,'' he said.
   ``Memorizers rattle off words rather casually, but later they
disappear rather quickly,'' Cameron said. ``That's the point at
which people who have read a lot and have sense of the shape of
words, the basic roots, make it.''
   He said few parents try to persuade him beforehand to go easy on
their youngster.
   Cameron, who's been at the University of Dayton for 25 years,
said his start in pronouncing was a fluke. He was looking over a
word list made by a colleague, Richard Baker, who served as the
national bee's pronouncer for 29 years.
   Cameron spotted a word on the list that could be spelled two
different ways. Baker drafted Cameron to proofread and eventually
turned the top job over to him when he retired.
   Cameron, who has never competed in a spelling bee, said every
once in a while he stumbles over a word when pronouncing but is
caught immediately by back-up readers and judges who shout out.
   ``Now and then, you have something carefully written out and you
look right at it and say the wrong thing,'' he said.

   Here is a text of remarks Saturday by Secretary of
State James A. Baker III after talks with Soviet leaders.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   We have just finished four days of long and detailed talks with
President Gorbachev, Foreign Minister Shevardnadze, and their
colleagues. These have been some of the most intensive discussions
we have had with our Soviet counterparts during this
Administration. In the end game of negotiations, it is reasonable
to expect both the intensity and difficulty of the work to
increase. In short, we have been engaged in some heavy lifting to
lock in agreements by the summit between President Bush and
President Gorbachev.
   I think our discussions have resulted in some real
accomplishments, and the progress we have made here makes me
optimistic that we will have a productive summit in Washington,
beginning less than two weeks from now.
   In the five hours of meetings with President Gorbachev, we
covered a number of issues, including some arms control; Baltic,
and in particular, Lithuanian, desires for independence; German
unification; and the Soviet economy. We had a full exchange of
views on these issues.
   I might just say that in the discussions I had here on
Lithuania, the parties expressed a desire to find a way to peaceful
dialogue. I can't say at this point that the Soviets and
Lithuanians have yet arrived at a common basis on which to proceed.
I think they are now more actively seeking to develop that basis,
but they are not there yet.
   Let me briefly cover the results of our talks and where our
relationship stands as we get ready for the Summit.
   On START (the Stragetic Arms Reduction Talks), our goal has been
to reach agreement on the major substantive issues by the summit,
and we are now in a position to do so. While some issues remain, we
have now reached agreement at this ministerial on what have been
two of the most vexing problems we have faced in START:
air-launched cruise missiles and sea-launched cruise missiles. On
ALCMs, we have agreed to a complicated formula which equitably
meets the needs of both sides.
   On SLCMs, we have agreed to a politically binding declaration
which will stand outside of the START treaty itself. The
declaration will enhance both strategic stability and
predictability without creating verification difficulties for
either side.
   We resolved a number of other START issues and also agreed to
begin to work on the objectives for follow-on negotiations on START.
   On chemical weapons, we have reached agreement on a
precedent-setting accord. I believe that this agreement is very
significant, particularly as it provides a real pathway toward a
global ban on horrific weapons that we already know from bitter
experience actually get used.
   Very simply put, this U.S.-Soviet accord is a trailblazing
agreement that implements the president's initiative on CW
(chemical weapons).
   On nuclear testing, we have completed work on the protocols to
the nuclear testing treaties. These are now ready for signing at
the summit.
   We also have agreed to a summit joint statement on nuclear,
chemical and missile non-proliferation.
   The one area where we made less progress in arms control than we
had hoped for is CFE (Conventional Forces in Europe). We had come
with ideas designed to push this process forward, but our
counterparts apparently weren't able to respond meaningfully at
this time.
   On regional issues, we had a full discussion on Afghanistan. I
believe we are close to developing a common basis on which to move
to free and fair elections _ the surest path to reconciliation,
peace, and legitimacy in that war-torn country.
   On Central America, our discussions reaffirmed the importance of
continued adherence to (the) Esquipulas (Treaty, which established
the Central American peace plan) and the need to end the insurgency
in El Salvador and promote a political dialogue.
   On human rights and democratization, we stressed our continuing
concern over the remaining refusenik cases in the Soviet Union and
the need to resolve all of them as soon as possible. I also raised
my concerns about anti-Semitism and the vital need for the Soviet
leadership to speak out strongly against it.
   We had exchanges on economics, transnational and bilateral
issues. We have finalized for signing at the summit several
U.S.-Soviet agreements in the commercial area, including the
Long-Term Grains Agreement and the Maritime Transportation
Agreement.
   In terms of transnational and bilateral issues, we are ready to
sign a maritime boundary agreement, an agreement on oceans study,
an accord to open cultural and information centers in Moscow and
Washington, and perhaps others. We also will be able to sign the
Thousand-Thousand Agreement _ an exchange of a thousand
undergraduate students between our countries.
   In closing, we have worked to prepare the ground so that our
presidents can lock in and institutionalize mutual points of
advantage in our relationship.

<HEAD>Banking Official Calls Regulation a Plus for Economy</HEAD>

   Builders complaining about a ``credit crunch''
are actually better off than they would be if regulators relaxed
lending standards to keep money flowing, a federal banking official
said Saturday.
   Sometimes ``economic growth and a safe and sound financial
system appear to come into conflict''in the short run, Comptroller
of the Currency Robert L. Clarke told the National Association of
Home Builders.
   But ``economic growth must rest on a safe and sound banking
system'' in the long run, he said in a speech prepared for delivery
to the trade group.
   Earlier in the week, the group's president, Martin Perlman,
complained that a credit crunch was crippling the construction
industry, threatening 200,000 jobs.
   Restrictions on savings and loans that Congress built into the
nine-month-old S&amp;L bailout law combined with a crackdown on real
estate lending by commercial bank regulators mean ``builders are
being indiscriminately cut off from the credit markets,'' Perlman
said.
   Clarke, whose office regulates nationally chartered banks,
pointed out that banks have increased their mortgage lending from
21 percent of the market in 1985 to 35 percent in 1989.
   Without tough regulation, banks might not have been able to pick
up the slack in mortgage lending when the S&amp;L industry ran into
trouble, he said.
   Clarke added that regulators are not trying to prevent banks
from making real estate loans but merely attempting to encourage
caution in light of a cyclical downturn in real estate markets.
   ``If a banker ever tells you that he can't make a loan because
examiners won't let him _ be suspicious. ... We're not telling them
to cut off credit from good customers,'' he said.

<HEAD>Asteroid That Killed Dinosaurs May Have Hit Cuba</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An asteroid many scientists believe ended the
dinosaurs' reign on Earth 66 million years ago may have struck just
off the western tip of Cuba, say two U.S. researchers.
   If they can overcome diplomatic hurdles caused by the U.S.
economic embargo, Bruce Bohor of the U.S. Geological Survey in
Denver and geophysicist Russell Seitz, a former Harvard visiting
scholar, want to go to the island to confirm their theory.
   ``The very presence of Cuba itself may be due to the asteroid,''
Bohor said in a telephone interview last week. ``The curved tip of
western Cuban may be the crater rim, and the Isle of Pines could be
the central uplift,'' or peak.
   Clues pointing to a Caribbean landfall were assembled slowly in
the decade since scientists first advanced the idea of a
catastrophic end to the dinosaurs. Although the asteroid theory is
not universally accepted _ some paleontologists blame climate
changes or disease for the dinosaurs' extinction _ it now has
widespread support.
   The theory requires an asteroid about 6 miles in diameter
gouging out a crater up to 150 miles wide. The resulting dust
cloud, or perhaps impact-spawned fires, volcanic activity, climatic
shifts and other factors, could have killed the giant reptiles
directly or choked off their food supply.
   ``But there was a tough time accepting this because there was no
crater to relate it to _ so we had to find a crater,'' Bohor said.
``The possibility was that it hit in the ocean, but that was hard
to determine.''
   Researchers, however, began to notice what is in effect a
geological directional arrow pointing to somewhere near North
America.
   A study by Arizona researchers Alan Holdebrand and William
Boynton, published in Friday's Science magazine, agrees about the
general area of the strike, somewhere in the Caribbean. They
believe the asteroid fell more to the south of what is now Cuba,
however _ closer to Colombia.
   Bohor and Seitz, who explained their theory in the April 12
edition of Nature, say without a close inspection of the Cuban
site, no one can be sure. And, they say, all geologists are basing
their findings on the same data.
   All around the world, a layer of irridium, an element found in
asteroids, has been found at about the 66-million-year level in
geological formations. Also found at the same level are ``shocked''
mineral grains _ microscopic quartz crystals apparently blown out
of the Earth's crust by a massive impact and carried around the
world by winds.
   But something interesting happens to those crystals in North
America, says Seitz.
   From Colorado south, the crystals get bigger _ so big they could
not have been blown there, but would had to have been ejected
directly by the force of impact.
   Then a team examining what was thought to be a volcanic site in
Haiti, just east of Cuba, made an intriguing find _ similar
crystals that appeared to come from an asteroid impact. But the
crystals were 10 times bigger than any previously found and were in
a layer 25 times thicker.
   ``It set off a bell that we were getting closer to the crater,''
Bohor says.
   Bohor and Seitz then began poring over geological data from the
Caribbean, and came upon old references to beds of large, exotic
boulders in Cuba.
   Scientific studies in Cuba since Fidel Castro took power in 1959
have been conducted primarily by Eastern bloc experts. In 1986,
Polish geologist Andrej Pszczolkowski published a study of
half-mile sized boulders found on the sea floor off the Cuban
coast. From the patterns of the rocks, he determined they must have
been hurled there, rather than simply pushed by slow geological
movement, as earlier researchers theorized.
   If the asteroid did strike near Cuba, even larger rocks must lie
either on the island or just offshore, rocks as large as 3 miles
wide, they believe.
   As geologists, Bohor and Seitz take no position on whether an
asteroid killed off the dinosaurs, or even if this impact might be
a candidate. Their goal, they say, is simply to determine if there
is an impact just south of Cuba's western tip 66 million years ago.
   Knowing where the asteroid hit could help solve questions about
``nuclear winter,'' acid rain, previously unexplained evolutionary
patterns and other scientific controversies.
   Of most immediate concern, it could give insight into confusing
geological plate movements in the Caribbean, they note. Examining
the crater could perhaps help determine when and where to expect
earthquakes.

<TEXT>
   Christians from around the
world gathered Saturday for a new version of the centuries-old
Passion Play about the suffering of Jesus, rewritten to cut out
anti-Semitic passages and images.
   Until now, the play depicted Jewish high priests with horns and
obscured Jesus' identity as a Jew. In the new version, Jesus and
the apostles wear traditional prayer shawls, and Jesus is
frequently addressed as ``Rabbi.''
   ``When we Christians put on an affair involving Jews _ after all
Jesus was a Jew and nearly all of the characters were Jewish _ we
have to do it with a great deal of caution and respect,'' said the
play's 28-year-old head director, Christian Stueckl.
   But a main question at Saturday's performance _ a final dress
rehearsal before the premiere on Sunday _ was whether the changes
went far enough.
   Controversy focused on a passage in which Jews, upon the
condemnation of Jesus, cry out: ``His blood be on us and on our
children.''
   The words, used for centuries, are seen by many as burdening the
Jews with collective guilt for Christ's death.
   ``Why must this sentence, which has plagued Jews for so many
generations, remain in the play?'' Jewish theologian Pinchas
Lapide, an Austrian who worked as an adviser to the play's
directors, asked at a news conference.
   Stueckl said he had wanted to remove the line but could not win
permission from the village committee presiding over the play.
   A five-page epilogue to the play text defends the line, saying
it is not anti-Semitic.
   ``The words about blood guilt are not meant to be anti-Semitic
or anti-Jewish,'' wrote Rudolf Pesch, an adviser to the text
committee. He said the words were ``formulated in the Jewish
biblical tradition.''
   ``Jesus was a Jew. Anti-Semitism of any kind is also directed
against him,'' Pesch added in the epilogue.
   The Oberammergau Passion Play dates back to 1633, when bubonic
plague was raging. Roman Catholic villagers vowed to stage a
Passion Play every 10 years if the plague abated, and it did. It
was considered a miracle.
   Now Christians converge on the Bavarian alpine village of 5,000
every 10 years for the staging of the play. The last performance, a
special jublilee presentation in 1984, attracted 470,000 visitors,
about half of them Americans.
   Nearly half a million visitors are also expected this year.
There will be 95 performances of the daylong production, which runs
until Sept. 30.
   Some got a preview on Saturday by viewing the dress rehearsal.
   ``The quality of the production _ the acting and the music _ is
just excellent,'' said Maj. Barry Cole, 39, a U.S. Army pilot from
Chattanooga, Tenn., who is stationed in West Germany.
   ``I've never seen such a wonderful setting,'' said his wife,
Rebecca.
   While the audience sits inside the theater, the stage extends
beyond the roof under the open sky. The Bavarian alps are the
backdrop, and birds fly overhead.
   Meanwhile, play officials said prosecutors were investigating a
possible case of fraud that left thousands of would-be playgoers
disappointed.
   Village officials said at a news conference that two British
travel agencies had paid a local hotel about $1.25 million for
20,000 tickets that the hotel then failed to deliver as promised.
   The committee said the hotel was not authorized to sell tickets,
which travel agencies can obtain only from the official
Oberammergau community tourist office. The play has been sold out
for months.
   The committee said prosecutors were investigating the hotel for
possible fraud. The agencies asked that extra performances of the
play be held for their disappointed customers, but the committee
turned them down.

   D. Tennant Bryan, chairman of Media General
Inc. since the newspaper holding company was created in 1969, will
be succeeded July 1 by his son, J. Stewart Bryan III.
   The younger Bryan, 52, also was chosen Friday by the company's
board of directors to become president and chief executive officer,
replacing James S. Evans, 68, who will stay on as vice chairman.
   Stewart Bryan, a member of the board of directors of The
Associated Press, is the fourth generation of his family to serve
as a newspaper publisher in the city. His great-grandfather founded
the forerunner of the Richmond Times-Dispatch and The Richmond News
Leader in 1850.
   Stewart Bryan has been chief operating officer of Media General
since last year. In addition to the two Richmond newspapers, the
company owns the Tampa Tribune in Florida and the Winston-Salem
Journal in North Carolina, three television stations, two cable TV
franchises, a 40 percent share of New Jersey-based Garden State
Newspapers and all or part of several newsprint plants.
   In more than 25 years with the company, Stewart Bryan has worked
as a reporter and in circulation, advertising and production. He
has been a director of Media General since 1974 and publisher of
the two newspapers since 1978.
   ``This change completes the leadership transition we began
several years ago and will enable Stewart Bryan to apply his
vigorous and innovative leadership to the full range of executive
functions at Media General,'' said Evans, who will remain a company
director along with the 83-year-old Tennant Bryan.
   The senior Bryan also will become chairman of Media General's
executive committee, a switch that longtime company director J.
Harvie Wilkinson Jr. compared to going from team manager to
third-base coach in baseball.
   ``I would be surprised if he doesn't still take a fairly active
role in the management of the company,'' said Michael Lavery, an
analyst with Wheat First Securities Inc. here.
   The management shifts were voted on by the directors just before
the start of the company's annual shareholders' meeting and were
announced when the meeting began.
   During a period of uneven earnings performance, Media General
has slimmed down its holdings to core East Coast media interests.
One of the biggest changes was the sale last year of two groups of
community weekly newspapers in Los Angeles and Orange County, Calif.
   Last year, the company's revenues fell to $606 million from $756
million in 1988, largely because of divested assets. Operating
profits of $65 million were down 34 percent from $98 million a year
earlier.
   Stewart Bryan acknowledged the industry has been in the doldrums
but said earnings would be ``robust'' this year. He would not give
an estimate.
   Evans said another year or two of lean financial results was
possible but the company's long-term future looked bright.
   ``It may be that Stewart Bryan is taking over at the beginning
of an era of renewed growth for the company,'' said Joseph L.
Antrim III, a media stock analyst at Davenport &amp; Co. in Richmond.
``Clearly, that's what they think is in store for them.''
   The younger Bryan said no major acquisitions are envisioned in
the near term.

   A Moscow-bound passenger train collided with a
freight train Saturday south of the Black Sea resort of Sochi,
killing at least nine people and injuring another 23, a Georgian
official said.
   Doctors were dispatched from the republic's capital of Tbilisi
to treat the injured at the crash site near Gantiadi, about 21
miles south of Sochi, the official Soviet news agency Tass reported.
   It said a government commission was also sent to investigate.
   Anatoly Zeykhanov, a duty officer for Georgia's Interior
Ministry, said the passenger train stopped ``for some technical
reason'' about 1.5 miles short of the station.
   ``Soon a freight train ran right into its tail end,'' said
Zeykhanov, who was contacted by telephone.
   He said four freight cars and one passenger car derailed and
``the preliminary estimates have it that nine people died on the
spot and 23 were hospitalized.''
   Tass said the passenger train had been en route from Tbilisi to
Moscow.

   Former Communist dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, had lavish burial plans, but a
government official said Saturday they were buried under false
names in a public cemetery.
   The ranking official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
confirmed rumors that the Ceausescus, who were toppled in the
December revolution, were buried at the Ghencea cemetery in south
Bucharest.
   ``He is on the left and she is on the right side of the path''
leading to the cemetery's chapel, the official said.
   Gravediggers took a group of Western reporters to the burial
site and pointed out two plots overgrown with weeds. Candles burned
on other nearby graves, but the two in question were unattended.
   The violent revolution that toppled the Ceausescus and ended
more than 40 years of repressive Communist rule climaxed on
Christmas Day when the two were executed.
   Ceausescu and his wife, a former Politburo member and first
deputy premier, had been tried in secret in a military barracks in
Tirgoviste, a city 43 miles west of Bucharest.
   A recent film of the Ceausescus' execution and burial was shown
on Romanian TV, but it did not disclose the site. The videotape
also did not show Ceausescu tearfully going to his death in front
of a firing squad and Mrs. Ceausescu screaming in panic at his side.
   Authorities, fearing that vengeful Romanians would desecrate the
graves, have refused to say where the two were buried.
   ``This is a state secret, we cannot let the cat out of the bag
... people might find out and they will scrub the graves to know
the truth,'' said Vasile Ionescu, a 68-year old carpenter who has
worked at the graveyard for 15 years.
   However, gravediggers showed reporters the unkempt plots assumed
to hold the Ceausescu's bodies. They refused to identify
themselves, saying they would be ``severely'' punished if the
authorities learned their names.
   The gravediggers pointed out the unusual way in which the graves
had been dug, breaking with the regular pattern and resembling
hastily added plots.
   The government official refused to disclose the names under
which the Ceausescus were buried.
   Ceausescu's presumed grave is topped by a common oak cross whose
inscription reads: Col. Popa Dan, 1920-1989. Mrs. Ceausescu's has
an identical wooden cross carrying the name Col. Enescu Vasile,
1921-1989.
   According to official statistics, Ceausescu was born in l9l8 and
Elena in l9l6.
   Cemetery administrators would not confirm the burial site and
insisted that the Ceausescus graves should remain ``secret.''
   ``They could be buried in Tirgoviste or some other place, but
not here,'' an undertaker said.
   The dictator and his wife had carefully planned for their
burials by ordering expensive gold-plated coffins, media reports
have said.
   ``The dictators deserved their fate'' said a beggar, pointing to
the cheap, desolate graves.

<HEAD>Baker Announces Chemical Weapons Deal, Progress on Nuclear Accord</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III on Saturday
concluded a ``trailblazing agreement'' with the Soviet Union to
destroy chemical weapons and settled long-smoldering disputes over
limits on nuclear-tipped cruise missiles.
   ``We have engaged in some heavy lifting,'' Baker said after four
days of marathon talks that set the stage for this month's meeting
between President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
``The progress we have made here makes me optimistic that we will
have a productive summit in Washington.''
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said the Moscow
meetings gave him ``confidence now that the treaty on strategic
arms can be prepared for signature before the end of this year.''
   At the same time, a tired-looking Baker said before flying home
that the two sides had made less progress than he hoped toward a
treaty to reduce troops, tanks and other non-nuclear arms in Europe.
   Bush, speaking with reporters in Texas, gave the talks a ``mixed
review.'' He said it would ``take some give'' by the Soviets for
the summit to be a success.
   The agreement on chemical weapons, to be signed during the May
30-June 3 summit, is designed to show the way for some 40 nations
negotiating a global ban on chemical weapons production in Geneva.
   ``Very simply put, this U.S.-Soviet accord is a trailblazing
agreement,'' Baker said.
   Baker said Bush and Gorbachev also will sign an agreement on
verifying limits on underground nuclear test explosions conducted
under 1974 and 1976 U.S.-Soviet treaties. The protocols call for
on-site inspection.
   Baker said the two sides were closer to a plan for elections in
Afghanistan, which the Soviet Union invaded in 1979.
   The agreement on air and sea-launched cruise missiles removes a
major obstacle to a declaration to cut U.S. and Soviet long-range
nuclear weapons by Bush and Gorbachev at their summit.
   ``We are now in a position to do so,'' Baker said, although he
said some issues remained to be settled. They will be tackled by
U.S. and Soviet negotiators beginning Sunday in Geneva, and the
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) might be completed by the
end of the year.
   A summit declaration would point the way to an overall reduction
of 30 percent to 35 percent in U.S. and Soviet long-range bombers,
missiles and submarines.
   Turning to Lithuania, Baker said the Soviets and the leaders of
the breakaway Baltic republic were working harder to find a way to
settle their dispute peacefully, ``but they are not there yet.''
   Baker was euphoric in announcing the chemical weapons pact.
   ``We have reached agreement on a precedent-setting accord,'' he
said. ``I believe that this agreement is very significant,
particularly as it provides a real pathway toward a global ban on
horrific weapons that we already know from bitter experience
actually get used.''
   Under the agreement to be signed at the summit, the two sides
would immediately cease production of chemical weapons and destroy
80 percent of their stocks.
   By the eighth year, both sides would have reduced their supplies
further to 2 percent of the current level and two years after that
they hope to destroy the rest, if all other countries capable of
producing chemical weapons join them in a global ban, U.S.
officials said.
   The nuclear test accords have never been ratified by the Senate,
and former President Ronald Reagan reported to Congress the Soviets
may have exceeded the ceiling of 150 kilotons.
   Shevardnadze and Baker said the U.S. and Soviet presidents also
will issue a joint statement against the spread of nuclear and
chemical arms.
   Baker noted less progress than he hoped to complete a treaty on
conventional forces in Europe. ``We had come with ideas designed to
push this process forward, but our counterparts apparently weren't
able to respond meaningfully at this time,'' he said.
   On Afghanistan, he said the United States and the Soviet Union
were closer to developing a plan for free and fair elections _
``the surest path to reconciliation, peace and legitimacy in that
war-torn country.''
   Although Baker did not go into details, U.S. and Soviet
officials have been mapping out a plan that would permit the
Soviet-backed government in Kabul to try to retain a share of power
in a transitional government, but President Najibullah and many of
his key supporters would have to step down.
   On human rights, Baker said he had registered his concern about
anti-semitism ``and the vital need for the Soviet leadership to
speak out strongly against it.''
   He said he was concerned, as well, over the refusal of
authorities to grant exit permits to Jews on the ground they knew
state secrets. According to U.S. officials, 12 of the 20
``refuseniks'' Bush urged Gorbachev at the Malta summit last
December to let go have not been given permits.
   Shevardnadze said he had asked Baker to raise the U.S. quota to
allow more Soviet Jews to emigrate to the United States rather than
Israel, in order to reduce tensions in the Middle East. He said no
specific number was mentioned.
   On strategic nuclear arms, Baker said the two sides reached
agreement on ``two of the most vexing problems we have faced:
air-launched cruise missiles, and sea-launched cruise missiles.''
   Missiles carried on fighter planes would be curbed under a
``complicated formula which equitably meets the needs of both
sides'' he said.
   As for sea-launched cruise missiles, Baker said the superpowers
agreed to a declaration outside START.
   ``The declaration will enhance both strategic stability and
predictability without creating verifications difficulties for
either side,'' Baker said.
   Shevardnadze said the agreement on cruise missiles ``was not
easy to achieve,'' and that talks almost broke off at some points.
   Explaining the agreement on air-launched cruise missiles, Baker
said the Soviets achieved their goal on the range of the elusive
missiles, while the United States won out on how nuclear missiles
would be distinguished from conventional cruises and on the
numerical ceiling.
   On sea-launched cruise missiles, which the United States
successfully sought to exclude from the pact, Baker said there
would be limit of 880 of the nuclear-tipped version but there would
be no system of going aboard ships or otherwise verifying how many
weapons were at sea.

<HEAD>Lynch's `Wild at Heart' a Success at Cannes, Despite Sex and
Violence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUZY PATTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CANNES, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Wild at Heart,'' David Lynch's latest
dark and surreal portrait of contemporary America, was well
received at the Cannes Film Festival on Saturday, despite its heavy
dose of violence and explicit sex.
   Lynch's film was the last of three American movies shown in
competition for the Golden Palm award. Given the warm applause it
received from critics and journalists at special press viewings, it
looked like a well-placed contender.
   Like Lynch's earlier films, ``Eraserhead'' and ``Blue Velvet,''
and his current TV series, ``Twin Peaks,'' ``Wild at Heart''
follows a cast of peculiar and quixotic characters through a plot
drawn from the world of soap operas.
   The Cannes program described Lynch as an ``Eagle Scout from
Missoula, Montana,'' but the director told a news conference the
film would have been even more violent if he had portrayed the
fantasies he had as a Scout.
   The story line, base on a novel by Barry Gifford, describes a
love affair between Sailor Ripley, portrayed by Nicolas Cage, who
commits manslaughter in self-defense, and Lula Pace Fortune, played
by Laura Dern.
   Lula's alcoholic, nymphomaniac mother _ played by Dern's
real-life mother, Diane Ladd _ tries in vain to get rid of the
hapless Sailor.
   The film becomes a chase as the young couple are pursued through
the Deep South and Texas all the way to a seedy burg called Big
Tuna by various characters who are engaged to waylay and kill
Sailor.
   The people the couple encounter along the way include a hoodlum
named Bobby Peru, portrayed by Willem Dafoe, and his exotic
girlfriend, played by Isabella Rosselini wearing a blond wig and
bushy eyebrows.
   The Cage-Dern couple have explicit love scenes throughout.
   The audience also witnesses plenty of gore. In one scene, Sailor
batters a knife-wielding aggressor. In another Cage and Dern watch
a girl bleed to death after a car accident. And in a third, a
passing cop kills Peru.
   It's all done with a straight face, but as in his other works
the impression is that Lynch is often laughing up his sleeve.
   Fire becomes a central image in ``Wild at Heart,'' including
flashbacks showing the violent death by fire of Lulu's father.
   Cigarettes are lit so often that one critic remarked: ``You
might have a hard time getting the film shown on planes in the
States.''
   ``It might set off smoke alarms,'' Lynch agreed.
   Lynch said he was worried the American Motion Picture
Association may force him to cut some of the most violent and
sexually explicit scenes for American audiences.
   He said he gave test showings and ``in the first, 100 people
walked out. In the second, 120 left.''
   ``But I cut one little thing,'' he added without saying what,
``and nobody walked out of the third showing.''
   In all, 19 films from a dozen countries are competing for the
Golden Palm. The two other American entries are Clint Eastwood's
``White Hunter, Black Heart'' and Alan Parker's ``Come See the
Paradise.''
   The film festival ends Monday following a showing of ``The
Comfort of Strangers,'' an American film directed by Paul Schrader
that is being shown out of competition. The Golden Palm winner is
announced Monday evening.

   Rival Shiite Moslem militia factions
allied with Syria and Iran fought street battles in crowded west
Beirut Saturday as a cease-fire appeared to be holding in the
Christian enclave.
   Police said one person was killed and 17 others were wounded in
the sudden outbreak of violence between the pro-Iranian Hezbollah,
or party of God, and the Syrian-backed Amal militia.
   The fighting engulfed west Beirut's densely populated
neighborhoods of Bourj Abu-Haidar, Musaitbeh and Nuwairi, where the
Iranian embassy is located.
   When the battles erupted at 4 p.m., panicky motorists abandoned
their cars to take cover in nearby buildings.
   Hundreds of families huddled in basements and bomb shelters as
the two sides blasted each other's positions with mortars and
rocket-propelled grenades.
   Voice of the Nation, a Moslem-run radio station based in Bourj
Abu-Haidar, interrupted programming to report that a school in the
district was burning. It appealed to civil defense officials to
dispatch fire engines to the scene.
   Police said Syrian troops in charge of west Beirut's security
deployed troops and tanks in the embattled district three hours
later, and enforced a cease-fire.
   It was unclear what touched off the battles, but a Hezbollah
statement accused Amal militiamen of firing rocket-propelled
grenades at Hezbollah militiamen.
   Amal and Hezbollah have been locked in a struggle since May 1987
for control over Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, who make up the
largest single sect in the country.
   At least 1,041 people have been killed and 3,076 wounded in
intermittent Amal-Hezbollah clashes in Beirut and south Lebanon in
the past three years.
   In Beirut's Christian enclave, police reported occasional
outbursts of sniper fire between rebel Gen. Michel Aoun's troops
and Lebanese Forces militiamen of his rival, Christian warlord
Samir Geagea.
   But they reported no serious confrontations or casualties.
   Despite the lull in the Christian enclave, security sources said
truckloads of ammunition sent by pro-Syrian factions were rolling
down the central mountains into Aoun's beleaguered Metn Province.
   The ammunition was mainly for his Soviet-designed 130mm howitzer
batteries, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   One source explained that Syria ``is not dealing directly'' with
Aoun, but that its surrogates were transporting the ammunition to
the army officer who last year fought the Syrians for six months in
what he called a war of liberation.
   The pro-Syrian groups involved in the operation, the source
said, were factions that have had a longstanding blood feud with
Geagea.
   The source said Aoun was paying cash for the ammunition, adding
that the moves served Syria's goal of stripping him of funds he
received from Iraq and the Palestine Liberation Organization. Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein and PLO chairman Yasser Arafat are Syrian
President Hafez Assad's main Arab foes.
   Saddam and Arafat had backed both Aoun and Geagea in last year's
war against Syria's 40,000 troops in Lebanon. The two have tried to
bring the 3-month-old inter-Christian confrontation to a halt in an
effort to rescue the anti-Syria camp in Lebanon.
   The inconclusive showdown between Aoun and Geagea has killed
1,031 people and wounded 2,769 since Jan. 30.

   Barbara Bush, who left college before
graduating to marry George Bush, was given an honorary doctor of
humanities degree Saturday and praised as ``a role model for wives
and mothers across the land.''
   Mrs. Bush urged graduates of St. Louis University to ``set sail
and take risks'' as they leave school, reminding them that no
decisions they make early in life are irrevocable.
   ``You need not have a game plan for life,'' she told them.
``George Bush certainly didn't. I know. I was there.''
   Mrs. Bush also made an indirect peace offering to feminists at
Wellesley College.
   ``Somewhere in this audience today may be a future president of
the United States,'' Mrs. Bush told the 1,488 graduates of the
Roman Catholic school. ``And I wish her well.''
   Last month's announcement that she would give the commencement
address at the Massachusetts women's college June 1 drew protests.
   About 150 of Wellesley's 2,200 students signed a petition saying
Mrs. Bush ``gained recognition through her husband's
achievements,'' not her own, ``which contradicts what we have been
taught over our years at Wellesley.''
   The president of St. Louis University, the Rev. Lawrence Biondi,
said however, that Mrs. Bush had accomplished much on her own.
   ``Her charm and wit have endeared her to the great and humble
alike,'' Biondi said. ``And by forthrightly choosing to be herself,
she has become the people's choice _ as a role model for wives and
mothers across the land (and) as a staunch supporter of
voluntarism. She is thus a most worthy candidate for recognition
... today.''
   The Wellesley controversy eased Friday when it was announced
that Mrs. Bush would share the podium with Soviet first lady Raisa
Gorbachev, who has a doctoral degree from a Soviet university.

<HEAD>Rebel, Government Spokesmen Deny Contra Disarmament Process Halted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RODOLFO GARCIA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a turnabout, officials of the
government and the Contra rebels on Saturday denied that the rebels
had stopped laying down their arms.
   A day earlier, the chief Contra military commander, Israel
Galeano, had said the disarmament process was suspended, citing
what he said were broken promises to the rebels and what he called
``social instability.''
   The rebel disarmament is one of the key elements of the
transition from President Daniel Ortega's Sandinista government to
that of Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, who was inaugurated April 25.
   The Contras had agreed to disarm by June 10, but the process has
been going slowly, with only 1,000 of about 11,000 fighters putting
down their weapons by Thursday.
   Roberto Ferrey, a former Contra leader who now is the government
coordinator for the disarmament, denied that the process had
stopped.
   ``At no time has the demobilization and disarmament process been
suspended,'' he said Saturday.
   In Miami, Contra spokesman Alejandro Acevedo said Galeano's
statements had been ``deauthorized'' by the Contras' general staff.
   The conflicting statements could not be immediately reconciled.
   Galeano released his statement from the remote community of El
Almendra, in one of several zones designated to safeguard security
while the rebels disarm. The zones are policed by the United
Nations.
   Asked if Contra commanders would release a second statement
rescinding the one from Galeano on Friday, Ferrey answered: ``That
depends on the decision of the general staff of the resistance.''
   Ferrey, who visited the El Almendra area on Friday, said he
explained the situation to the rebel leaders and added that ``the
wishes of the government and of Violeta Barrios de Chamorro remain
firm.''
   ``The process must continue ... the idea is to keep the
demobilization and disarmament process moving forward until it
arrives at its culmination,'' he said.
   Many Contras want top Sandinistas removed from high military
positions and say they want the size of Nicaragua's army, the
region's largest, pared down.
   Although the Sandinistas lost the elections, they still wield
considerable power. A paralyzing Sandinista-led strike by public
employees last week resulted in the strikers winning almost
everything they had demanded.
   Galeano said in his communique that demobilized Contras were not
getting sufficient food or care, that Sandinista troops had not
completely abandoned the security zones and that Sandinista
sympathizers have not been disarmed.
   Ferrey said he spoke with five Contra commanders who are part of
the general staff, and they assured him that the disarmament
process is continuing. Sergio Ramirez, vice president under the
Sandinistas, called the communique from Galeano ``an extremely
grave move against the peace and stability of Nicaragua.''
   A communique delivered Saturday to The Associated Press,
purportedly from a clandestine group called Urban Commandos of the
Internal Resistance, expressed support for the deal between the
government and the Contras but demanded the dismantling of
Nicaraguan military units near the security zones.
   It contended the army, made up almost entirely of Sandinista
supporters, plans to infiltrate the security zones starting June
11, the day after the rebel disarmament is to be completed.

   ``We are now in a position to do so,'' Baker said, although he
said some issues remained to be settled. They will be tackled by
U.S. and Soviet negotiators beginning Sunday in Geneva, and the
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) might be completed by the
end of the year.
   A summit declaration would point the way to an overall reduction
of 30 percent to 35 percent in U.S. and Soviet long-range bombers,
missiles and submarines.
   Turning to Lithuania, Baker said the Soviets and the leaders of
the breakaway Baltic republic were working harder to find a way to
settle their dispute peacefully, ``but they are not there yet.''
   Baker was euphoric in announcing the chemical weapons pact.
   ``We have reached agreement on a precedent-setting accord,'' he
said. ``I believe that this agreement is very significant,
particularly as it provides a real pathway toward a global ban on
horrific weapons that we already know from bitter experience
actually get used.''
   Under the agreement to be signed at the summit, the two sides
would immediately cease production of chemical weapons and destroy
80 percent of their stocks.
   By the eighth year, both sides would have reduced their supplies
further to 2 percent of the current level and two years after that
they hope to destroy the rest, if all other countries capable of
producing chemical weapons join them in a global ban, U.S.
officials said.
   The nuclear test accords have never been ratified by the Senate,
and former President Ronald Reagan reported to Congress the Soviets
may have exceeded the ceiling of 150 kilotons.
   Shevardnadze and Baker said the U.S. and Soviet presidents also
will issue a joint statement against the spread of nuclear and
chemical arms.
   Baker noted less progress than he hoped to complete a treaty on
conventional forces in Europe. ``We had come with ideas designed to
push this process forward, but our counterparts apparently weren't
able to respond meaningfully at this time,'' he said.
   On Afghanistan, he said the United States and the Soviet Union
were closer to developing a plan for free and fair elections _
``the surest path to reconciliation, peace and legitimacy in that
war-torn country.''
   Although Baker did not go into details, U.S. and Soviet
officials have been mapping out a plan that would permit the
Soviet-backed government in Kabul to try to retain a share of power
in a transitional government, but President Najibullah and many of
his key supporters would have to step down.
   On human rights, Baker said he had registered his concern about
anti-semitism ``and the vital need for the Soviet leadership to
speak out strongly against it.''
   He said he was concerned, as well, over the refusal of
authorities to grant exit permits to Jews on the ground they knew
state secrets. According to U.S. officials, 12 of the 20
``refuseniks'' Bush urged Gorbachev at the Malta summit last
December to let go have not been given permits.
   Shevardnadze said he had asked Baker to raise the U.S. quota to
allow more Soviet Jews to emigrate to the United States rather than
Israel, in order to reduce tensions in the Middle East. He said no
specific number was mentioned.
   On strategic nuclear arms, Baker said the two sides reached
agreement on ``two of the most vexing problems we have faced:
air-launched cruise missiles, and sea-launched cruise missiles.''
   Missiles carried on fighter planes would be curbed under a
``complicated formula which equitably meets the needs of both
sides'' he said.
   As for sea-launched cruise missiles, Baker said the superpowers
agreed to a declaration outside START.
   ``The declaration will enhance both strategic stability and
predictability without creating verifications difficulties for
either side,'' Baker said.
   Shevardnadze said the agreement on cruise missiles ``was not
easy to achieve,'' and that talks almost broke off at some points.
   Explaining the agreement on air-launched cruise missiles, Baker
said the Soviets achieved their goal on the range of the elusive
missiles, while the United States won out on how nuclear missiles
would be distinguished from conventional cruises and on the
numerical ceiling.
   On sea-launched cruise missiles, which the United States
successfully sought to exclude from the pact, Baker said there
would be limit of 880 of the nuclear-tipped version but there would
be no system of going aboard ships or otherwise verifying how many
weapons were at sea.

<TEXT>
   A Republican legislative leader announced
Saturday that he wouldn't seek the Republican nomination to
challenge Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo's expected re-election bid
this year.
   The move by State Assembly Minority Leader Clarence Rappleyea
leaves GOP leaders still struggling to find a strong candidate to
tackle Cuomo with the state Republican Convention scheduled to
begin a week from Tuesday.
   ``I am not going to run for governor,'' Rappleyea wrote in a
letter to state GOP Chairman J. Patrick Barrett, who had asked him
to consider a bid. ``I just don't want to be governor.''
   Cuomo, considered a potential 1992 presidential contender, is
expected to announce in the next week or two his candidacy for a
third term.
   For a time, Rappleyea had appeared to be a possible light at the
end of the tunnel for beleaguered Republican leaders in search of a
well-known Cuomo challenger.
   But in his letter to Barrett, Rappleyea said he wanted to remain
a legislator and someday become speaker of the state Assembly,
currently controlled by Democrats 98-52.

   Militants on rooftops shot and killed
10 people and wounded 27 in this southern city Saturday, bringing
to 29 the number of people killed last week in clashes between
rival ethnic parties, police said.
   The extremists also set fire to a dozen shops during the attacks.
   Thousands of paramilitary troops, soldiers and riot police
patrolled the streets of this southern city of 700,000 to try to
control the violence.
   Members of the Mohajir Quami Movement, a militant Indian
immigrant party, and Sindhi nationalists demanding independence or
greater autonomy are behind the violence, police said. MQM wants to
be recognized as a fifth nationality in Pakistan, along with the
Pathans, Baluchi, Sindhis and Punajbis.

<TEXT>
   Every spring, when the corn started
sprouting and the tiny yellow-and-white chamomile flowers began
winking along the narrow roads, the dark shadow of Nicolae
Ceausescu fell over this village.
   That was when the line of blue and black official cars would
begin to arrive, bringing the Communist leader on frequent visits
to his holiday residence about 20 miles north of Bucharest.
   This year, everything is different.
   For the first spring in decades, there is no Ceausescu in
Snagov, no army or secret police. And on Sunday, residents once
imprisoned by fear will vote in the first free national elections
in more than 50 years.
   ``There's a new atmosphere,'' said Dumitru Grigore, a retired
supply clerk at the Ceausescu vacation compound. ``People are
living better.''
   Like many other villages in Romania, Snagov suffered under
Ceausescu, who was overthrown and executed in a popular revolution
last December.
   Traditional homes were torn down and replaced by concrete
apartment buildings in a forced urbanization program. Inefficient,
collectivized agriculture caused food shortages.
   In addition, Snagov had the burden of playing host to the
capricious Ceausescu.
   Local residents say peasants had to kill their roosters every
spring so they would not wake him. Roads were blocked. The church
bell was silenced. And residents were sometimes ordered to work on
Sundays, because Ceausescu liked to see them looking busy.
   ``We were not allowed to have a pig, because they stink,'' said
Gheorge Trandafir, 79, who farms a small plot across the street
from the walled-in Ceausescu compound.
   A new era has begun in this village of 3,000 people, reflecting
nationwide changes wrought by the interim government led by Ion
Iliescu.
   The hated urbanization program has been halted. And the
transitional government has granted peasants the right to own about
5,000 square yards of land, up from 200 square yards under
Ceausescu.
   ``From the moment Iliescu came to power, we have had food and
wood for the fire,'' said Trandafir's wife, Anica, 75, wrapped in a
faded dress, her gray hair peeking from a brown-and-yellow
polka-dot scarf. Behind her, corn sprouted and grape vines dangled
from wires.
   ``Ceausescu was not for his people. He was for himself,'' she
declared.
   Who would she vote for on Sunday? ``For the one who gives me
bread,'' she smiled.
   She shrugged off opposition charges that Iliescu _ the
presidential candidate of the National Salvation Front _ was an
unreformed Communist.
   ``Everyone had to be a Communist if he wanted to do well,'' she
said.
   Grigore expressed similar enthusiasm for Iliescu and the Front,
a loose grouping of former Communist officials and intellectuals
who took power during the revolution.
   ``My opinion is that everyone is content about Iliescu. We had a
hard life under Ceausescu,'' he said.
   He gestured to a series of modernistic, bone-white apartment
buildings that people were being forced to inhabit. The style
contrasted sharply with the traditional brick or stucco village
homes trimmed with curly wrought iron and surrounded by gardens.
   ``If Ceausescu hadn't died, no houses would have remained
here,'' Grigore said. ``He had to die for the village to survive.''
   About 400 of the 1,600 homes in the village were demolished
under the urbanization program, local officials said.
   Now, on the edges of Snagov, new homes and barns are going up.
   Ceausescu's vacation compound is still off limits, guarded by
soldiers. But Mayor Nicolae Marian Marinescu says the national
government is planning to convert the series of lakeside villas
into residences for visiting Western business executives.
   The mayor said villagers were excited about voting, but that
some vestige of Ceausescu remained.
   ``They feel more liberated,'' he said. ``But after 45 years of
fear, they have fear in their souls.''

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney joins NATO
defense ministers in Brussels this week to evaluate the diminished
Soviet threat and chart the future of the Western military alliance.
   The meeting follows U.S.-Soviet agreement, announced Saturday in
Moscow, on cooperation to ban production of chemical weapons and
resolution of major disputes on cutting long-range nuclear arms.
   The defense ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization's member nations will focus on NATO's plans for its
armies and non-nuclear weaponry, and to hear an updated report on
the threat posed by Soviet forces.
   Cheney, in a speech Friday in Washington, termed the Warsaw Pact
``a fiction,'' a military unit that ``no longer constitutes a
significant military threat to Western Europe.''
   ``The threat may not have disappeared totally, but it certainly
would appear to be headed in that direction,'' Cheney said in a
speech to an executive exchange group at the State Department.
   At the Brussels meeting Tuesday and Wednesday, the ministers
must assess the need for their own armed forces once an East-West
accord is completed on slashing the number of tanks, artillery and
other so-called ``conventional'' weapons.
   Although the pace of the talks in Vienna has slowed, an
agreement is expected to be reached later this year. In an attempt
to erase a major sticking point, the administration has put forward
new proposals that could allow a compromise on the number of combat
aircraft allowed by either side.
   The Brussels talks come only two weeks after ministers met in
Canada, where they agreed to make more cuts in their arsenal of
short-range nuclear missiles. The sessions have been scheduled as a
series of consultations in preparation for the summit of NATO
government leaders in London in July.
   This week's session ``will show that much useful work has been
done at NATO and in its capitals to plan ahead for the environment
we anticipate by the mid-1990s,'' said a senior Pentagon official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   At the session, the ministers are expected to formally scrap the
longstanding, but rarely honored, budget target of a 3 percent
annual growth in their defense budgets.
   As well, the United States and the NATO allies have tentatively
agreed on a plan for sharing the cuts in tanks, artillery and other
weapons that are expected to be reached in the conventional arms
accord later this year.
   Alliance sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, have
indicated the United States will get the largest share of the cuts.
   Unchanged for NATO, the Pentagon official said, will be ``a
militarily significant U.S. force presence in Europe'' and the
presence of U.S. nuclear weapos on the continent as a deterrence to
nuclear war.
   In the coming months, the alliance faces two crucial tasks, the
official said.
   These include identifying the aspects of NATO ``which can and
should be revised,'' and developing a plan ``for much broader
changes'' that will take into account the implementation of the
conventional arms accord, the withdrawal of Soviet troops from
Eastern Europe and the emergence of pluralistic systems in those
nations.

   One of the men wounded when robbers
interrupted a high-stakes dice game at a cafe last week died
Saturday, bringing the death toll to five, hospital officials said.
   Bob Woods, administrative director for John Peter Smith
Hospital, said Earl Edwards Jr., 30, of Fort Worth died at 3:30
a.m. The death of complications from a single gunshot wound was
ruled a homicide, said the Tarrant County medical examiner's office.
   Masked robbers broke in to the Glass Key Cafe on Monday morning
during a gambling session, shooting eight people, police said. Four
of the people died Monday.
   Timothy Miller, 19, and his brother, Paul Miller, 22, were
arrested Thursday night on capital murder warrants. Police on
Saturday continued their search for a 23-year-old suspect also
named in the warrants, and tried to determine the identity of the
fourth gunman.
   The assault, the bloodiest in Fort Worth since 1982, reportedly
interrupted a dice game in which players were betting thousands of
dollars on each roll. Authorities say up to $400,000 was involved
in the game, and one of the victims was carrying $60,000.

   Strains of ``Kingdom Coming'' echoed along
Pennsylvania Avenue on Saturday in a re-creation of the last march
125 years ago of the victorious Union army.
   Among those joining in an abbreviated _ in time and troop size _
reenactment of the Grand Review were a company of the 54th
Massachusetts Regiment, the black soldiers made famous in the movie
``Glory.''
   Although few blacks were in the original parade, representatives
of the regiment's Company B in Saturday's gathering were given the
honor position at the wreath-laying ceremony at the statue of Gen.
Ulysses S. Grant at the foot of the U.S. Capitol.
   Morale was high despite temperatures near 80. The Civil War
enthusiasts seemed to take the heat in stride even though all wore
authentic wool uniforms and many were in full pack.
   ``Marvelous, don't we love them, guys,'' Paul Baader, 43, said
as he tugged at his uniform.
   Baader, an advertising executive from Bayonne, N.J., stood at
the head of the 2nd Rhode Island Volunteer Infantry and the First
Company, U.O..
   Walter B. Sanderson, a 37-year-old area resident who had played
a sergeant in ``Glory'' and managed the company's affairs
off-screen, said the heat was worse in 1865. ``It was hotter, no
doubt of that.''
   One of his group was felled by heat prostration while waiting to
march, he said.
   Sanderson said black regiments were left out of the original
march because they were on guard duty in Charleston, S.C.
   About 2,000 people took part in Saturday's march from the
Capitol to the Washington Monument, compared with some 150,000
victorious Union soldiers who marched on May 23-24, 1865.
   Saturday's march was sponsored by the National Park Service and
a local development group.

   A Colombian reputed to be an important
figure in the Medellin cocaine cartel was convicted Saturday on two
federal drug conspiracy counts.
   Jose Abello Silva faces up to $8 million in fines and 30 years
in prison. U.S. District Judge Thomas Brett set sentencing for May
29.
   Jurors convicted Abello, 35, of conspiring to import marijuana
and cocaine into the United States and conspiring to possess drugs
with intent to distribute.
   His attorneys said they would appeal.
   Abello met with his attorneys after the verdicts and sobbed,
said defense attorney Richard Haynes.
   ``It's a normal human reaction,'' Haynes said. ``He's
devastated. He's hurt. He's terribly disappointed. He cried. I
cried.''
   The jury deliberated a little more than 20 hours over three days
before issuing its verdicts. Jurors' identities remained secret
throughout, for security reasons.
   Prosecutors called 23 witnesses during five weeks of testimony.
Many were convicted drug smugglers who identified Abello in the
courtroom and said he supervised drug shipments from Colombian
airstrips through the Bahamas.
   Abello testified that he was an honest rancher who sold imported
cars and fought bulls on the side. He said he was a friend of the
Ochoa family _ alleged to be part of the leadership of the Medellin
drug cartel _ but said his visits were limited to dealings with
cattle.
   Haynes and co-counsel Patrick Williams said prosecutors' secrecy
about witnesses hurt their case, and Haynes criticized pretrial
publicity.
   ``We'll appeal. We think there are some errors in the case,''
Williams said. ``This has been couched in secrecy. We were totally
denied access to previous statements witnesses made.''
   Williams said many of the witnesses were confessed drug
smugglers and suggested they had lied about Abello to shorten their
own prison sentences.
   ``Snitches behind bars can come up with stories that will fool
good investigators, that will fool good prosecutors and that are
totally untrue,'' Williams said.
   Abello, of Santa Marta, Colombia, was indicted in Tulsa in 1987.
He was extradited Oct. 29 from Bogota to Tulsa.
   Colombia's Administrative Security Department said he had been
arrested in a Bogota restaurant and that he had undergone facial
surgery to avoid easy detection.
   It also said Abello was the fourth-ranking person in the
Medellin cocaine cartel.
   The Administrative Security Department said Abello was the
cartel's chief of operations for Colombia's northern coast, where
dozens of clandestine air strips are used to smuggle 300 to 400
tons of cocaine into the United States each year. That region also
has ports where cocaine is stashed aboard rusty freighters working
the coast of Central America and Mexico.
   Abello was not on the U.S. Justice Department's list of 12 most
wanted traffickers, but the department has said it wanted dozens of
other Colombians on federal drug charges.
   Of 15 Colombians extradited to the United States since last
August, Abello is the first whose case has reached a verdict.
   The case against Abello started in 1986 when Oklahoma
authorities arrested a drug courier en route to Denver. He agreed
to cooperate under a plea agreement and helped police hook Boris
Olarte Morales.
   Olarte also agreed to cooperate and began making telephone calls
to fellow smugglers. The calls resulted in a February 1987 meeting
in Aruba, off Venezuela's coast, between Abello and several others.
   Prosecutors contended Abello agreed to import 500 kilograms of
cocaine _ more than half a ton _ into the United States. Part of
the proceeds allegedly would have gone to help free Olarte. The
plan was never enacted.
   Abello testified that he attended the meeting in Aruba, but said
he stormed out of the room when the conversation turned to drugs.

   African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela
thanked Moammar Gadhafi for his support during a meeting with the
Libyan leader, that country's official news agency reported
Saturday.
   Mandela, who has a grandson named after Gadhafi, was greeted
with a 21-gun salute when he arrived Friday evening with his wife,
Winnie, and others, said a JANA dispatch from Tripoli, Libya.
Mandela is on a North African tour.
   JANA, monitored in Rome, said Mandela thanked Gadhafi for his
backing and conveyed the solidarity of the people of South Africa
with Libya.
   ``You have spoken all the time and openly against all forms of
tyranny and oppression, and you have provided military assistance
to the people of South Africa in their struggle for freedom and
self-determination,'' the agency quoted Mandela as saying to
Gadhafi.
   It quoted Gadhafi as saying, ``We salute your courage, we salute
the struggle of the people of South Africa, we salute your
steadfastness during imprisonment, and we did not forget even for
one single day your suffering.''
   Last year, Libya awarded Mandela a human rights prize. The
prize, named after Gadhafi, was presented to Mandela's daughter
Zenani since Mandela was still imprisoned in South Africa. He was
released in February after more than 27 years behind bars.
   In past years, the South African government has accused Libya of
training some of the black guerrillas fighting white minority rule.
Mandela is deputy president of the ANC, which has run a largely
ineffective guerrilla war against the government.
   JANA said Mandela and his delegation visited the former
two-story house of Gadhafi that was damaged in the U.S. bombing of
Tripoli on April 15, 1986. The gutted, rubble-strewn residence is a
routine tour for many foreign visitors.
   The United States has long been at odds with Gadhafi, accusing
him of backing international terrorism.
   JANA said Mandela noted that he first visited Libya in 1962.
That was seven years before Gadhafi came to power in a coup that
overthrew the monarchy.
   Mandela arrived in Tripoli from Algeria. He went to Egypt on
Saturday for a two-day visit to brief President Hosni Mubarak on
efforts to dismantle racial segregation in South Africa.
   While in Cairo, Mandela is also expected to meet with Palestine
Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat, who also arrived
there Saturday for talks with Mubarak.

<HEAD>First Lady Tells of Painful Bout With Depression</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First lady Barbara Bush says she suffered a
severe case of depression after returning from China in 1976, but
overcame it after throwing herself into volunteer work.
   ``I would feel like crying a lot and I really, painfully hurt,''
Mrs. Bush is quoted as saying in the May 28 issue of U.S. News &amp;
World Report.
   Mrs. Bush, the subject of the magazine's cover story, recalled
how depression overtook her when she and husband, George, returned
to the United States after two years in China.
   Bush had been the U.S. liaison officer in Beijing and the couple
had been together much of the time. But that changed drastically
when Bush returned to become director of the CIA.
   She said depression preyed on her mind. ``And I would think bad
thoughts, I will tell you. It was not nice.''
   Her remedy was to volunteer for service work in the Washington
Home, a health-care center for the seriously ill. In that role she
performed chores ranging from changing bedclothes to washing the
hair of patients.
   She befriended a number of nurses and patients and remains close
to Janet Tulloch, a resident of the home who has cerebral palsy,
U.S. News said.
   Within six months, the depression cleared up and has never
returned, according to the magazine.
   It said many of her service efforts have gone unreported and
that she dislikes ``braggadocio,'' which she considers
self-aggrandizing and a bit tawdry.
   It was not the first time the first lady turned to volunteer
work in time of stress, the magazine said. She threw herself into a
volunteer project in 1953 following the loss of her 3-year-old
daughter Robin to leukemia while the family was living in Midland,
Texas.
   ``The pain was so extraordinary,'' she said.
   ``For a while after Robin died I played with my children all of
the time,'' she said. ``I one day heard little George out the
window saying to his friend, `I can't play with you today. I have
to play with my mother.' And that's when I threw myself into the
League project.''
   Calling on wealthy friends for contributions and spreading the
news among the poor, she worked with a forerunner of the Junior
League to establish a thrift shop to help clothe the needy.
   The future first lady also worked at Midland Memorial Hospital,
giving baths to patients and rubbing their backs.
   In the interview, Mrs. Bush also reiterated that she had no
quarrel with students at Wellesley College who have protested her
selection as commencement speaker.
   The students complained she was invited not because of her
independent accomplishments but because she is the president's wife.
   ``I'm not going to scold, I'm not going to cajole, I'm not going
to apologize, I'm not going to explain,'' said Mrs. Bush. Raisa
Gorbachev, the wife of the Soviet president, will join Mrs. Bush at
the commencement.
   ``The poor girls, they're so bored with it now they could throw

graduates saying they are so upset about the protest that they will
no longer contribute funds to the elite New England women's college.
   ``I'd like to write a letter saying, `Please give to
Wellesley,''' she said. ``This is very normal. I understand it.
It's no big deal.''

   Actors Michael
Boatman and Kevin White went up, up and away for a segment of
``Robin Leach's Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.''
   They were filmed parasailing _ riding a parachute towed by a
boat _ over the Pillsbury Sound between the U.S. and British Virgin
Island on Friday.
   Boatman, of ABC's television series ``China Beach,'' said he
selected the Caribbean for a vacation because of his passion for
water sports and the beautiful surroundings.
   ``The water's just not the same in California,'' he said.
   Boatman recently completed filming a cable television feature
film, ``Fourth Story,'' with actor Mark Harmon. He will return to
filming ``China Beach'' later this summer.
   White recently completed a television movie, ``Victor 1'' and
said he will return to theater company work in Los Angeles.

<HEAD>Three Police Officers Slain; Ton and a Half of Cocaine Seized</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said Saturday they had seized
more than 1{ tons of cocaine in northern Colombia in a raid on a
processing lab, and they blamed drug traffickers for killing three
police officers in Medellin.
   Police said Friday's raid by a special anti-narcotics police
unit near the town of Puerto Triunfo, 75 miles north of Bogota,
yielded more than 3,000 pounds of cocaine.
   Authorities also seized processing equipment and about 25,000
gallons of ether, acetone and other chemicals used to make cocaine,
they said.
   In less than a month, police and army units have seized more
than 22 tons of cocaine. They say that is a record amount for such
a brief period.
   The policemen were killed in separate attacks late Friday in the
drug capital of Medellin, a police communique said Saturday.
   In the last eight days, 20 police officers have been slain in
the city, the base of the Medellin drug cartel. Police have said
the cartel is paying more than $4,000 for each police officer
killed.
   Authorities say the attacks on police are part of the drug
traffickers' campaign of violence, which has also targeted the
civilian population.
   Last week, four car bombings blamed on the traffickers killed 28
people and injured more than 300 in the cities of Bogota, Cali and
Cartagena.
   The government began a U.S.-backed crackdown on the traffickers
in August following the slaying of presidential candidate Luis
Carlos Galan, and the traffickers have responded with a wave of
attacks in a bid to force an end to the crackdown.

<HEAD>Syria Criticizes Britain for not Doing Enough on Hostages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Syrian government official Saturday
accused British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of lacking
interest in gaining the release of British hostages held in Lebanon.
   Information Minister Mohammad Salman used the issue to criticize
the British government for making it difficult for Syrian
journalists to enter Britain, and he said Syria would retaliate.
   ``In spite of the efforts displayed continuously by Syria to
secure the release of the Western hostages in Lebanon, it seems
that the government of Mrs. Thatcher is not interested in the fate
of British hostages, since it has not established any dialogue or
contact with the concerned Syrian authorities,'' Salman said.
   Britain broke relations with Syria in 1986 after its
intelligence services were linked to an effort to plant a bomb
aboard a London-Tel Aviv flight.
   Still, Salman said, Syria has always smoothed the way for the
entry of British journalists. They have been allowed to obtain
visas at Damascus Airport or other border posts two to three days
after notifying the Information Ministry, he said.
   Britain, however, has forced Syrian journalists to travel twice
to embassies in either Amman or Nicosia to apply for and pick up
visas, a process that often takes between four and six weeks and is
``very costly in Syrian standards,'' Salman said.
   From now on British, journalists will have to apply for visas at
embassies abroad and wait for an answer, he told a visiting United
Nations fact-finding team.
   The Syrians have been instrumental in negotiating hostage
releases. Two American captives were released in April through
Damascus.
   The remaining 16 hostages include six Americans, four Britons,
two West Germans, two Swiss, and Italian and an Irishman. Terry
Anderson, 42, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the longest-held hostage. He was kidnapped on March 16,
1985.
   The weekly magazine Al-Shiraa in Beirut, Lebanon, reported
Saturday that U.S. hostage Thomas Sutherland was ill and would be
the next American released.
   Sutherland, 59, former dean of agriculture at the American
University of Beirut, was kidnapped on June 9, 1985. The magazine
did not describe his health problems.
   In a brief report attributed to a knowledgeable source,
Al-Shiraa also said that an Irish envoy was in Beirut seeking the
release of the Irish hostage, Brian Keenan, and that contacts were
under way on behalf of the Britons. It did not name the Irish envoy.
   Al-Shiraa gained international fame in November 1986, when it
was first to report on the secret U.S arms shipments to Iran in
return for the release of hostages. But its reporting on hostages
since then, including several predictions about their release, has
been wrong.

   The U.S.-Soviet chemical weapons accord
announced Saturday brings to fruition a proposal President Bush
made to the United Nations last fall, six years after he used his
vice presidential power to save a $130 million nerve-gas program.
   Bush, exercising his constitutional authority as presiding
officer of the Senate, voted July 13, 1983, to break a 49-49 tie,
thus defeating an attempt to stop the Pentagon from modernizing
these lethal weapons.
   But the following year Bush carried a draft chemical weapons
treaty text to multilateral negotiations in Geneva on a global
accord. He proposed at the time that nations signing such a pact
stop producing the arms right away and destroy their stockpiles
over a 10-year-period.
   With the Geneva negotiations still dragging on, Bush, eight
months after being sworn in as president, brought his proposal to
the United Nations. In the Sept. 24 address, he said the United
States would agree to a chemical weapons phase-out.
   It was an attempt to spur a separate effort by Washington and
Moscow to find agreement on a bilateral chemical weapons ban.
   The Geneva talks continue, but Bush didn't want to wait. So the
accord hailed by Secretary of State James A. Baker III on Saturday
as a ``trailblazing agreement'' gives the superpowers a concrete
achievement to highlight at the May 30-June 3 summit that Bush will
host for Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   An era of generally declining U.S.-Soviet tensions and the
political risks of lost opportunities conspired to lead Bush
inexorably along the path that led to the Moscow breakthrough over
the weekend. And he's come under increasing pressure from Congress,
as well.
   The administration, in fact, served notice last week that it
opposed the Senate version of legislation which would require the
president to impose sanctions against nations that use chemical or
biological weapons in violation of international law.
   The State Department said the Senate bill, with its mandatory
sanctions, would limit Bush's constitutional authority to conduct
foreign policy.
   Bush's record on chemical weapons has been checkered over the
years. While he long has considered these weapons a world menace,
he also has believed the United States could not engage in a
wholesale destruction of its arsenal while countries retained
theirs.
   He was sharply criticized by Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, for failing to mention in the U.N. speech that
he had decided to make a new generation of chemical weapons even
while publicly pursuing an international ban.
   But Ronald Lehman, head of the Arms Control and Disarmament
Agency, jumped to Bush's defense, saying ``it is not good to cut
programs in anticipation of negotiations _ that undercuts your
negotiation leverage, it undercuts your security.''
   Six months later, the Pentagon confirmed that it was considering
forcing two chemical firms to sell the Army a key ingredient for
poison gas. The Army had used up its supplies of the chemical
thionyl chloride, accrued from the 1950s, and had sought new
supplies from Occidental Petroleum Co. and the Pittsburgh-based
Mobay Corp.
   Both companies have refused to supply the chemical, and told the
Pentagon their corporate policies barred them from providing it for
use in the production of chemical weapons.
   Pentagon spokesman Bob Hall said in late March that there were
other potential sources of the chemicals, and he declined to say
whether the Pentagon would invoke its power under the Defense
Product Act to compel the sale of the material by Occidental and
Mobay.
   Under the agreement to be signed at the summit, the two sides
would immediately cease production of chemical weapons and destroy
80 percent of their stocks.
   By the eighth year, both sides would have reduced their supplies
further to 2 percent of the current level and two years after that
they hope to destroy the rest, if all other countries capable of
producing chemical weapons join them in a global ban, U.S.
officials said.
   The United States and the Soviet Union are the only two nations
to acknowledge having chemical weapons, although up to a dozen,
including Libya and Iran, are thought to have the grisly
substances. Iraq's President Saddam Hussein has boasted that he has
them _ and recently threatened to use them against Israel if
attacked by the Jewish state.
   The United States has about 32,000 tons of poison gas. The
Soviet stockpile is believed to be larger.
   Binary weapons, usually artillery shells or missile warheads,
contain two relatively safe compounds that combine to produce toxic
nerve gases. The first use of chemical weapons was outlawed under
the 1925 Geneva protocol.

   Incumbent President
Joaquin Balaguer clung to a razor-thin lead Saturday with most
ballots counted in a presidential race disputed by his main leftist
opponent.
   But the announcement of a winner was expected to be delayed for
several days until election officials finish reviewing tallies.
   Challenger Juan Bosch, of the Dominican Liberation Party,
claimed vote fraud had occurred and agreed to the review after
threatening to call for civil disturbances.
   The count continued at a snail's pace Saturday, four days after
the election, with ballots still being tabulated from 7 percent of
the more than 6,663 polling stations.
   Balaguer, an 83-year-old conservative, leads former President
Juan Bosch, an 80-year-old self-declared Marxist who had campaigned
on a moderate platform, by fewer than 20,000 votes _ a mere 0.5
percent of the vote, the Central Electoral Board reported.
   With 6,206 of the 6,663 polling stations reporting, Balaguer had
620,181 votes and Bosch, 601,954. Jose Fransisco Pena Gomez, a
former socialist mayor of Santo Domingo mayor had 406,070 votes.
   About 3.2 million people were registered to vote, and turnout
was estimated at 60 percent.
   Although those results are official, winners were being
certified by a laborious process under which thousands of tally
sheets obtained by political parties from polling stations were
checked against tallies received by election officials.
   The review began Saturday in the presence of representatives
from the four main political parties and could last several days,
officials said. All races, including 30 Senate, 120 congressional
and 103 mayoral contests, will be reviewed.
   The electoral board ordered the review Friday in an agreement
brokered by former President Jimmy Carter, one of 30 international
observers to the voting.
   Both Bosch and Pena Gomez accused Balaguer of widespread fraud.
   Bosch had threatened street protests but called them off Friday
after the board agreed to the electoral review. He had said before
the election he had evidence that Balaguer's Social Christian
Reformist Party had prepared 300,000 phony ballots to rig the
outcome _ a charge Balaguer denied.
   Pena Gomez, a former Bosch protege, said Friday there were
``grave irregularities'' and vote-buying by Balaguer's party.
   Before returning to the United States on Friday, Carter said
none of the candidates had presented any evidence of fraud but
added he had never observed such a close election.
   Wednesday's balloting was the fifth election pitting Balaguer
and Bosch against each other for leadership of this Caribbean
nation of 7 million people. Balaguer won three of the four previous
contests.
   Balaguer, now blinded by glaucoma, was first elected president
in 1966 and served three consecutive four-year terms before losing
power in 1978. He was re-elected in 1986.
   His popularity has waned as the country's economic crisis
worsened. He presided over a $2 billion public works project that
is remodeling the capital. The project created thousands of jobs,
but fueled inflation, while electricity blackouts and water
shortages continue.
   Bosch was the first freely elected president after the
assassination of dictator Gen. Rafael Trujillo. But the military
overthrew him in 1963 after only seven months in office.
   An attempt by rebel soldiers to restore Bosch to power led to
civil war in 1965. President Lyndon Johnson sent in 23,000 U.S.
Marines to prevent a leftist takeover.
   In this election campaign, Bosch endorsed capitalism to improve
the economy and pledged good relations with the United States.
   Bosch held a 10 percent lead in opinion polls before the
elections, but observers said he harmed his chances by criticizing
a 1954 agreement with the Vatican providing that all army chaplains
are Roman Catholic. The Dominican Republic is overwhelming Catholic.

   House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich
Saturday hosted an hour-long television show designed to kick off a
``citizen's involvement movement'' across the country.
   Sitting at the counter of a barbeque restaurant in Newnan, Ga.,
in his home state, Gingrich took views of the nationwide television
hookup to several sites around the country, including Portland,
Maine, Detroit and San Diego.
   ``We hope today to establish a citizen's opportunity
initiative,'' he said, ``because all of us know that the
bureaucratic welfare state and permissive attitudes have failed.''
   Gingrich had said in promoting Saturday's telethon that it was a
``nonpartisan'' undertaking. But the estimated $250,000 cost of the
satellite hookup was picked up by GOPAC, a Republican political
action committee.
   Two Democrats _ former Attorney General Griffin Bell and
Wisconsin State Rep. Polly Williams _ were among the mostly
Republican figures who appeared on the show talking about how
Americans fare best when they help themselves.
   ``We've become convinced that America's problems cannot be
solved by any political figure ... but by individual initiative,''
said Gingrich.
   The show revolved around ``success stories'' _ such as the
``Buddy Search'' computer service business founded by Vietnam
veteran Chuck Shontag in Davenport, Iowa, which aids veterans in
contacting one another.
   Ms. Williams was given a prominent role in the show, explaining
how she lobbied for a state law in Wisconsin giving lower-income
parents greater latitude in deciding where to send their children
to school.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South African President F.W. de Klerk appealed to
Europe on Saturday to completely rethink its policy toward his
country, saying the process of change there is irreversible.
   In Britain on the fifth leg of a European tour, de Klerk won
congratulations from Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for his
reforms.
   Calling for a ``fundamental reassessment'' of Europe's stand
toward his country, he said the continent generally recognizes
``that there is a new reality in South Africa.''
   The president has initiated a series of racial reforms in his
country. He is now negotiating to bring South Africa's black
majority into the political system.
   At a news conference, he indicated that some countries had had a
change of heart about issues like their sanctions against South
Africa, but were not yet ready to put it into practice.
   ``My general impression is that Europe is ready to take specific
steps, is really ready to do this re-evaluation,'' de Klerk said in
reply to a question.
   But ``in some countries, it is felt that public opinion still
offers an obstacle to this, and that maybe Europe will need some
time before it can concretize the conclusions that they have
already arrived at.''
   However, de Klerk insisted he had not come to Europe looking for
specific measures, such as a relaxation of sanctions.
   Asked about the African National Congress' demand that sanctions
be maintained, he said: ``I personally think that sanctions in
general are in any event becoming irrelevant almost, by what is
happening inside South Africa, and therefore we are not here to
address that as a primary issue. It has not surfaced as such in the
talks that we have had.''
   The ANC, whose deputy president is Nelson Mandela, is the
leading group fighting the apartheid system of racial separation in
South Africa.
   In 1986, the 12-nation European Economic Community banned
imports of South African iron, steel and gold coins. After de
Klerk's talks in Belgium on Thursday, a Community official said it
was too early to talk of lifting the sanctions.
   Mrs. Thatcher broke ranks with her European partners by lifting
some sanctions against South Africa as a gesture of encouragement
after de Klerk released Mandela from prison in February. He has
served 27 years of a life sentence for sabotage and plotting to
overthrow the white government.
   Apart from his Saturday talks and lunch with Mrs. Thatcher at
Chequers, her country residence, de Klerk also met British
industrialists and bankers.
   De Klerk declined to give timetables for negotiation or for
lifting the state of emergency that gives authorities sweeping
powers to quell black unrest.
   However, seeking to demonstrate that changes are moving fast, he
said a report by a joint government-ANC committee on the question
of exiles and political prisoners ``is almost on the table and on
my return to South Africa it will receive immediate attention.''
   In Johannesburg, South Africa, the government Saturday granted
temporary amnesty to 38 exiled anti-apartheid activists, including
ANC President Oliver Tambo and other leaders of the organization.
   The amnesty, valid until Aug. 19, will allow ANC officials to
return to South Africa for talks with the government designed to
clear the way for full-scale constitutional negotiations.
   In Durban, about 8,000 members of a Zulu political party, some
heavily armed, marched to the U.S. consulate Saturday to call for
the end to economic sanctions.
   Representatives of the United Kingdom, Italy and West Germany
also were at the consulate to receive a petition from Inkatha, a
relatively conservative group headed by Mangosuthu Buthelezi.
   The Inkatha marchers carried pointed sticks, spears, whips,
knives, axes, clubs and iron bars as they marched though central
Durban. However, police took no action and no violence was reported.
   Earlier, a British spokesman said Mrs. Thatcher congratulated de
Klerk for the changes he has brought about, and quoted her as
saying ``there will be further substantial progress on all fronts
in the near future.''
   De Klerk visited France, Greece, Portugal and Belgium before
arriving here. He flies to West Germany on Sunday, and continues to
Switzerland, Spain and Italy.

   Radical reformers Saturday proposed amending the
Russian republic's constitution to give its laws priority over the
laws of the Soviet Union, in a direct assault on President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's authority.
   The draft ``sovereignty'' declaration is similar to the ones
that began the Baltic republics' drive for independence 18 months
ago. If adopted, it could dramatically reduce the power of
Gorbachev's government.
   It would allow the Russian parliament to push through more
radical reforms than Gorbachev wants in the republic, which
contains 52 percent of the Soviet population and three-quarters of
its land mass.
   The author of the proposal, Social Democratic leader Oleg
Rumyantsev, said in an interview he believed it could be approved,
possibly as early as Monday.
   Rumyantsev estimated there are 350 to 500 progressives among the
1,059 members of the newly elected Russian parliament who would
vote for the proposal. The positions of several hundred more
remained unclear.
   Constitutional amendments normally require a two-thirds majority
to pass.
   But Rumyantsev noted that 1,004 of the legislators _ nearly all
_ voted to move the issue of sovereignty high on the parliament's
agenda.
   ``This shows that sovereignty could be a possible point of
consensus,'' he said.
   However, many of those 1,004 legislators undoubtedly share the
opinion of Alexander Vlasov, the candidate for Russian president
backed by Gorbachev. He said he supports sovereignty but defined it
only as a ``special approach'' to the unique problems of Russia.
   ``The republic laws must must not be superior to the law of the
Soviet Union,'' said Vlasov, the current Russian premier. At a news
conference Saturday, he said if Russian leaders do not like a
national law, they have the right to complain and suggest changes
to the national legislature.
   Rumyantsev said the Gorbachev-Vlasov forces favor only economic
sovereignty for Russia, such as control over its own natural
resources. But he said even this idea requires political
sovereignty, because it contravenes Soviet law.
   The sovereignty proposal is comparable to an American state
amending its constitution to claim that it no longer must abide by
U.S. laws, unless they are accepted by the state legislature.
However, unlike the U.S. system, the Soviet constitution says each
of the 15 republics in the country is ``a sovereign republic,''
without defining the term.
   Gorbachev has said the sovereignty declarations in the Baltic
states of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia are invalid.
   But he did nothing to enforce that decision, and the three
republics then pursued their own economic and political reforms
regardless of national, Soviet law. The drive culminated this
spring in declarations of complete independence from the Soviet
Union, which Gorbachev has fought.
   Using its sovereignty law, Lithuania's parliament legalized
non-Communist parties last December, outraging hard-liners. Two
months later, however, Gorbachev asked the national Communist Party
to permit identical reform throughout the country.
   But allowing the tiny Baltics, with a total population of 8
million, to succeed in flouting Soviet law is far different from
permitting the same decision in Russia, the heart of the Soviet
Union with 147 million people.
   The Russian radicals also hope to elect Gorbachev critic Boris
Yeltsin president of their republic, instead of Gorbachev's man,
Vlasov. The agenda calls for the parliament to vote on that after
deciding the sovereignty issue.
   Saturday afternoon, several hundred people surrounded
legislators returning from the Kremlin to their hotel to chant
their support for ``Yeltsin! Yeltsin!''
   ``The bureaucrats need Vlasov, the people need Yeltsin,'' one
poster read.
   One middle-aged woman who declined to give her name said she
favored Yeltsin because ``he is a people's leader who has refused
all privileges.''
   ``He's smart and talented,'' she added.
   The sovereignty proposal also could play havoc with Gorbachev's
economic blockade of Lithuania, which he imposed in hopes of
forcing the republic to rescind its declaration of independence.
   Legislator Mikhail Bocharov, a factory manager who has led
experiments with workers leasing their plants from the government,
said Russia should have the power to decide whether to supply oil
to Lithuania.
   ``That is the affair of a sovereign state,'' Bocharov said in
last week's New Times magazine.
   Yuri Kovalchenko, another man in the crowd of Yeltsin
supporters, said he favored giving more authority to the Russian
parliament because it was more professional and democratically
oriented than the national one.
   The national parliament was elected last year, in the Soviet
Union's first multi-candidate elections, and it includes many
hard-liners.
   The Russian parliament was elected this spring, after the people
had experienced a full year of democratic reform, and includes a
greater proportion of progressives.

   When the first evacuation call came, folks
in this river bottom town thought the spring floods would wash
through their neighborhoods for a few days at most.
   Now nerves are fraying as they learn the highest waters this
century may keep them away from home for months.
   Hundreds have dug in at camp grounds, emergency shelters and
hotels, and some don't even know if they have a home to return to.
   ``Stop and think if it's your house ... and you don't know,''
said Chris Dozier, her eyes filling with tears. ``Some people might
say, `It's only a home,' but it's not only a home when it's your
home.''
   Mrs. Dozier, 63, and her husband, like several hundred others,
were forced this week to leave the Camilla Twin Harbors subdivision
just below Lake Livingston Dam.
   Authorities this week have been releasing record amounts of
water from the dam's floodgates, inundating low-lying areas,
because heavy rain swelled the Trinity River upstream.
   Since Thursday, water has gushed through at a rate of 756,000
gallons a second, and the Trinity River Authority says releases
will continue for another five or six days.
   Mrs. Dozier said she and her husband knew they were building in
a flood plain 10 years ago, but they never expected water to reach
the rooftops.
   The retired couple has been staying at a motel for a week and a
half, but say they can't afford to stay there much longer.
   Spring flooding has long been considered an inconvenience, but
not a disaster, until this flood and a lesser one last June.
   ``We were never even told to expect anything like this,'' said
Louis Dozier, gazing down at a flooded pasture near the river.
``That looks like a nice lake there, doesn't it? Normally that's
grange land for the cattle. The river's supposed to be on the other
side of those trees.''
   The Doziers said they, like many neighbors, will rebuild and
take their chances because they can't afford to move.
   Authorities say it could take all summer for enough water to
recede to let residents return to the areas below the dam.
   Ed Lepley, San Jacinto County emergency management coordinator,
said Camilla Twin Harbors residents were evacuated because up to 20
feet of water endangered them and rescue workers.
   ``When we bought the land, they told us it wasn't in a flood
plain,'' lamented Rebecca Ward, who with her husband, Curtis
Brooks, has lived in the nearby Cedar Valley subdivision for five
years.
   Stress showed on their faces as they headed to a rented house in
Houston, where they'll wait for the water to leave their river
bottom home.
   The retired couple plan to return, but will put their trailer on
higher blocks, Brooks said.
   Of those evacuees who think they'll stay, many said they don't
know how much it will cost to rebuild because they haven't been
able to see their property.
   Bill and Audrey Wyatt said they've had it with life in the flood
plain, though they'll keep their Camilla Twin Harbors property as a
vacation getaway. They bought their trailer last year, right before
the June flood.
   ``We don't want to give up the place, but I don't want to live
here any more. We've been through this twice in one year,'' Mrs.
Wyatt said.
   For the past week, they have camped at the Grocery and Marina
Campground, with about 200 other subdivision refugees. Camp owners
give them free sites, water and utilities.
   Mrs. Wyatt, shaky from being unable to sleep since leaving home,
said they'll leave the area as soon as their 9-year-old daughter
finishes school June 2.
   ``There's snakes galore, rats galore, alligators over on Fourth
Street,'' Mrs. Wyatt said. ``It's a little much.''

<HEAD>50,000 Macedonians Block Greek Border</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than 50,000 ethnic Macedonians
blocked three border crossings with Greece on Saturday to protest
that country's refusal to recognize them as a separate nationality,
the state news agency reported.
   The protesters, from the Yugoslav side of the border, also
demanded abolition of Greek visas for Yugoslavs and discussion of
the Macedonian issue by the United Nations, the European Parliament
and other international organizations, the Tanjug news agency said.
   Greece, like Yugoslavia's eastern neighbor Bulgaria, says
Macedonia is a historical and geographical term and there is no
Macedonian ethnicity.
   On Friday, Greek consular officials in Skopje, capital of the
Yugoslav constituent republic of Macedonia, turned back more than
100 Macedonians with the explanation that ``conditions do not
exist'' for issuing visas to them.
   On Saturday, the Macedonians from shut three border crossing
points with several hundred trucks and buses, but two of the points
were opened six hours after they were blocked.
   Vasil Tupurkovski, Macedonia's representative to Yugoslavia's
collective presidency, addressed 20,000 protesters at Gevgelija,
one of the crossing points.
   He said the protester's demands were ``a test for European
democracy.'' He said the presidency will discuss the issue on
Wednesday.
   Foreign Minister Budimir Loncar, meanwhile, called for an urgent
meeting with his Greek counterpart, Andonis Samaras.
   Macedonia is one of Yugoslavia's six republics. Ethnic tensions
have been increasing in Yugoslavia, and two weeks ago a separatist
party won multiparty elections in the republic of Croatia.

   Rain was scattered over much of the central part of the nation
Saturday, causing flash flooding in Iowa, and snow moved into the
mountains of northern California and western Nevada.
   At midday, showers and thunderstorms extended from north-central
Oklahoma across northeastern Oklahoma, eastern Texas, western
Louisiana, Arkansas, northwestern Mississippi, southern and
east-central Missouri, Illinois, northwest Indiana, Wisconsin,
northern Iowa and southern through central Minnesota.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
2.09 inches at Little Rock, Ark.; 1.39 inches at Springfield, Mo.;
and 0.98 of an inch at both Fort Leonard Wood, Mo., and Redwood
Falls, Minn.
   Rain also soaked central and eastern South Dakota during the
night, with up to 4.6 inches reported in the southeast near Yankton.
   There was flooding during the night along Perry Creek at Sioux
City in western Iowa and more than 200 people had to be evacuated
until after sunrise. The creek crested almost 2 feet higher than a
1949 record flood, the National Weather Service said.
   The White River in southwestern Indiana reached its highest
flood in almost 30 years, the weather service said.
   Flooding continued on the Trinity River in southeastern Texas,
and a flood crest on the middle Red River was expected to reach
Alexandria, La., during the night.
   Advisories were posted overnight into Sunday morning for snow
from a late spring storm in California's Mount Shasta-Siskiyou

<HEAD>Chefs Heat Up The Competition For Culinary Olympics</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Seven chefs were up to their elbows in cornish
game hens, veal, oysters and other ingredients as dawn broke
Saturday, hoping to create the top taste and palate pleaser to earn
them a spot at the culinary Olympics.
   The cooking competition started at 6 a.m., kicking off the
National Restaurant Association international trade show at the
city's lakefront McCormick Place convention center. The show runs
through Wednesday.
   Thirty-three chefs will be in the kitchen this week, vying for
25 spots at the international cooking championship in West Germany
next year. The winners of the national competition will be
announced Tuesday.
   Out of the kitchen, however, the restaurateurs are faced with a
keener competition _ for the customer.
   ``The thing that's probably affecting all of them is the
overdevelopment of the industry _ too many restaurants growing too
fast in too many areas,'' said Michael Hurst, the association's
president.
   A hot topic in the restaurant industry is a trend among
expensive, formal restaurants toward so-called ``downscaling.''
   A suburban restaurant boom throughout the 1980s produced an
abundance of good, close-to-home restaurants that drew customers
away from very expensive, formal, downtown restaurants, Hurst said.
   ``You tended to be able almost to cut the grass and go get
something to eat,'' he said. ``You might prefer once in a while to
get dressed up and go back downtown, but it's a thing that's done
less often.''
   In the fight to regain customers, some restaurants are scaling
down. That can take the form of lowering prices, redecorating,
adding lower-cost entrees, or shutting down and reopening
completely under a different concept, he said.
   For the duration of the five-day trade show, Chicago restaurants
will have no lack of customers. For several evenings, thousands of
the toughest critics in the country will be looking for a place to
eat.
   ``We're totally, totally booked,'' said Luann Bayless, manager
of the city's popular Frontera Grill.
   More than 100,000 people from the restaurant and hotel industry
in the U.S. and 70 other countries are expected for the conference.
   ``This is the greatest meeting place of suppliers and users in
the hospitality industry,'' said Richard Cregar, a member of the
association's board of directors and chairman of the convention.
   Those who attend will browse among 2,000 companies' equipment
and supply lines _ ``everything from cream puffs to washing
machines,'' Cregar said.
   Many of the products on the exhibit floor bring technological
innovations to the restaurant.
   Sweet Art of Kansas City is displaying birthday cakes decorated
with computer-generated reproductions of photographs.
   Jeron Technology of Boca Raton, Fla., is marketing a noiseless
beeper that's intended for use by the kitchen staff to summon the
wait staff. The beeper vibrates to page the waiter or waitress.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Saturday called
for legalizing private ownership of homes and residential lots,
challenging a 73-year-old Communist law that stipulates state
ownership of all such property.
   The official Tass news agency said he made the proposal in an
attempt to solve the nation's critical shortage of housing.
   All Soviet land is now owned by the state, under one of the
strongest tenets of Communism. However, Soviet leaders have already
approved private ownership of buildings, equipment and factories.
   Gorbachev's decree instructed the government to formulate new
measures by Sept. 1 that would double the pace of building
individual homes and apartments.
   Tass said Gorbachev ordered a housing plan that ``removes the
whole number of restrictions on building individual housing in the
Soviet Union, grants the right to own and inherit housing and the
plots on which it is built.''
   The housing plan would overturn the Land Decree of 1917 that
nationalized all private land holdings.
   The law was the precursor to dictator Josef Stalin's massive
collectivization of farms in the 1930s. The collectivization cost
of millions of lives through starvation, and many peasants who
resisted were sent to forced labor camps.
   Gorbachev's decree Saturday called for at least 30 million new
apartments and houses by the year 2000 to meet Gorbachev's pledge
of individual dwellings for all Soviets by the end of the century.
   ``The seriousness of the housing problem has not lessened,'' the
decree said. ``It is obvious that solving the housing problem with
current methods is impossible.''
   Gorbachev's call-to-action urged legislation allowing individual
bank loans for housing construction, construction of apartments for
immediate sale, and a sharp increase in the availability of
construction materials, now virtually unavailabile to individuals
because they are allocated to government agencies.
   Gorbachev's decree said there have been recent positive shifts
in solving the housing problems, but the problem is still acute.
``Nearly 4.5 million families live in housing with less than five
square meters (yards) per person,'' it said.
   Five square meters is about half the size of a small Western
bedroom.
   The long-range plan is to develop a housing market in which
every family can choose whether it wants an apartment or a house,
Gorbachev's decree said.
   It did not spell out whether individuals would have the right to
sell property purchased from the government, but it warned against
speculation, the Soviet term for selling at a profit.
   The Supreme Soviet legislature in March approved private
ownership of buildings, equipment and factories. But under
Gorbachev's direction, it rejected legalizing private ownership of
land.
   Just a month later, Gorbachev's advisory board was reported to
be reconsidering that policy.
   At the time, Gorbachev spokesman Arkady Maslennikov told a news
conference that economists believed the widespread sale of
apartments, and possibly land, could help soak up a vast pool of
billions of rubles in private bank accounts and under mattresses,
for which there are no goods to buy.

<TEXT>
   Six members of an international drug ring
were convicted of distributing tons of cocaine in a case
authorities say was one of the first to link a Colombian cocaine
cartel to Los Angeles street gangs.
   The gang's two leaders, Brian ``Waterhead Bo'' Bennett and Mario
Ernesto Villabona Alvarado, faced mandatory life prison sentences
without possibility of parole under a federal drug kingpin law.
   The other four convicted Friday with Bennett and Villabona by a
U.S. District Court jury could each receive prison terms of 10
years to life at sentencing scheduled July 30.
   Villabona, 29, also was ordered to forfeit to the government
$750,000 discovered in bank accounts in Denmark.
   ``It's very significant because it's one of the first to
establish a connection between Colombian cartels bringing enormous
amounts of cocaine into this country and black gangs,'' said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Dean G. Dunlavey.
   Authorities say Bennett, 24, is a Los Angeles gang member and
Villabona is a high-ranking official in the Cali cocaine cartel.
Prosecutors contended that Villabona imported tons of cocaine to
Los Angeles and Bennett supervised distribution to gangs that sold
it in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Detroit and other cities.
   Bennett and Villabona were convicted of operating a continuing
criminal enterprise.
   Each of the six defendants was convicted of conspiring to
possess thousands of kilograms of cocaine with intent to distribute
and of possessing nearly 1,000 kilograms of cocaine each.
   Also convicted were Maria Cecilia Fatima Barona, Luz Janneth
Martinez, Michael Harris and Michael DuBarry McCarver, all of Los
Angeles.
   As the verdicts were read, Martinez hung her head and sobbed.
The others showed no emotion.
   Defense attorneys said they would appeal, claiming that wiretap
recordings and other evidence used by the prosecution should not
have been admitted.
   ``If the Department of Justice thinks that convicting these
young people is going to do one thing to stop the flow of drugs,
they're crazy,'' Martinez' attorney, David Chesnoff, told reporters.
   Federal investigators testified the defendants laundered drug
proceeds through bank accounts in Panama and Denmark. Authorities
said Villabona and Bennett also bought legitimate businesses,
including a chain ofcheck-cashing outlets, to launder drug money.
   Prosecutors said McCarver and Harris served as cocaine
distributors, while Martinez and Fatima arranged shipments of cash.

   European Community foreign ministers
gathered at this southwest Ireland resort Saturday to work on a
blueprint for a political union of Europe by 1993.
   ``This is the start of a major exercise,'' said Irish Foreign
Minister Gerry Collins, chairman of the two-day meeting, in an
interview with Irish radio.
   He spoke as the ministers of the 12-nation community met at
Parknasilla, a picturesque garden resort overlooking Kenmare Bay.
Ireland holds the rotating presidency of the body of Western
European nations.
   The meeting was the ministers' first attempt to draw up draft
proposals on a political union to present to the community's heads
of state at a meeting at the end of June.
   At a special summit in Dublin on April 28, community leaders
agreed in principle to achieve a closer political union by 1993.
   In June, the leaders are expected to convene an
inter-governmental conference on political union, despite British
reservations. The European Community plans to create a vast common
market by the end of 1992.
   Britain has been skeptical toward the idea of a political union
and has proposed that the community's elected assembly, the
518-member European Parliament, is only given powers to control the
group's spending and to monitor compliance by member states with
community-wide regulations.
   But France and West Germany, backed by Italy and Belgium, have
argued that Western Europe must forge greater ties as a stabilizing
force in Europe.
   France favors power centered in the heads of government, while
West Germany favors greater powers for the European Parliament
based in Strasbourg, France.
   Several smaller community nations, including Ireland, have been
reluctant to increase the powers of the Parliament, which allocates
seats according to population.

   Graduating seniors at Hood College on
Saturday made sure the school's president didn't leave commencement
empty-handed.
   In 1988, President Martha E. Church was handed a goldfish for
each diploma she bestowed. On other years, it's been marbles and
pennies.
   On Saturday, the class of 1990 left its legacy in gladioli.
   As the 254 seniors received their diplomas, each handed Church a
gladiolus bulb resembling a cluster of garlic.
   They will be planted around a $9.2 million library and
information technology center being built at the school of 2,000
students, mostly women, in western Maryland.
   ``They're going to come up red, hot pink, light pink, white,
yellow and purple,'' representing the class' diversity, said
graduate Michal Lord, a 22-year-old from Denver.
   ``It's one of the best gifts,'' Church said of the gladiolus
bulbs. ``This can be shared by everyone. They will make the campus
beautiful for years and years to come.''
   The gag-gift tradition began in 1985, when Church received 242
marbles that rolled all over the stage for lack of something to put
them in.
   ``The students were doing this, Martha was going crazy and the
audience looked like they didn't know what was going on,'' recalled
Barbara J. Hetrick, vice president and dean of academic affairs.
   ``So since I was at the microphone, I said: `The students are
informing President Church that she has lost her marbles and that
they are returning them one-by-one.'''
   Ever since, seniors have tried to outwit the preceding class.

   The government is prosecuting the
Czechoslovak Communist Party for ``stealing from the state,''
Prosecutor General Pavel Rychetsky was quoted as saying Saturday.
   Rychetsky made the announcement at a rally in Prague, according
to the state news agency CTK. He demanded the Communist Party give
up all property unlawfully acquired during its more than 40-year
rule.
   ``We consider it our primary duty to introduce order and justice
in this country,'' Rychetsky said in the presence of Czechoslovak
President Vaclav Havel.
   ``I can therefore tell you that (his office) ... launched
criminal proceedings on charges of stealing from the state by the
Communist Party,'' he added.
   According to witnesses at the rally, Rychetsky did not provide
any names or specify the charges. But reliable sources indicated
that current officials of the Communist Party could be investigated
in the near future.
   Four of the 22 political parties running in Czechoslovakia's
parliamentary elections June 8-9 have demanded outlawing the
Communist Party. But the appeal was rejected both by Havel and the
Federal Parliament.
   However, there is general agreement among all political forces
in the country that much of the party's property should be
confiscated.
   Quoting participants at the rally, CTK said property acquired by
Communists over the last 18 years alone amounted to about $1
billion.
   Rychetsky said most of the criminal acts under investigation now
would fall under an amnesty declared by Havel on Jan.1.
   ``However, the moral condemnation by the nation and the
publishing of our findings will undoubtedly be necessary,'' he said.
   It was near clear if unlawful acquisition of property would be
covered by the amnesty.
   Czechoslovakia, caught up in the democratic tide last year,
swore in its non-Communist government in December.

   A senior U.S. official denied Saturday
that Secretary of State James A. Baker III urged Lithuania's prime
minister to suspend the Baltic republic's declaration of
independence from the Soviet Union.
   In fact, the official said, Baker assured Prime Minister
Kazimiera Prunskiene in Moscow on Friday that the Bush
administration wanted the independence movement to succeed.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has demanded that
Lithuania retract the March 11 declaration as a precondition for
negotiating a settlement. Gorbachev met with Mrs. Prunskiene on
Thursday night.
   After Baker met with her, reports circulated in Moscow that he
had urged Mrs. Prunskiene to suspend the declaration to facilitate
a dialogue with the Kremlin.
   The senior official, briefing reporters as Baker flew home,
denied the report.
   ``In the meeting, he made very clear to them (the Lithuanians) ,
very explicit to them, this is not a decision anybody but you can
take,'' the official said. ``Whatever decision you take, it is one
we are going to support,'' the official quoted Baker as saying.
``This is exactly what he said.''
   Baker did not talk to reporters on the flight here to refuel his
U.S. Air Force jet. The official who gave the briefing imposed
rules that bar identifying him.
   Earlier, at a news conference in Moscow, after four days of
talks with Soviet officials, Baker was asked whether he had pressed
Mrs. Prunskiene to retract the declaration.
   ``I did not press them,'' he said. ``I said dialogue was
important.''
   Baker also said he told the Lithuanian leader ``we support
strongly their hopes and aspirations, and I made that point.''
   Baker did not encourage Mrs. Prunskiene to suspend the
declaration and ``he at no time suggested any approach'' to deal
with the Soviets, the official said.
   Again quoting Baker, the official said he told Mrs. Prunskiene
``you are the best judge of what you can do.''
   Gorbachev has imposed a partial economic blockade against
Lithuania while also advising the leaders there to pursue
constitutional means in seeking independence. That process could
take five years.
   Meanwhile, the two other Baltic states _ Estonia and Latvia _
also are pushing for independence from the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev told Baker he did not have ``a lot of room to
maneuver'' on the Baltic situation, the U.S. official said.
   ``He (Gorbachev) made it clear he understood the Lithuanians
could not simply give in to a diktat and that he could not simply
demand they revoke the declaration because that would put them in a
position that would be untenable,'' the official added. ``He said
there would have to be a compromise.''

   Lithuania's prime minister Saturday urged
lawmakers in her breakaway republic not to suspend their
declaration of independence, despite Soviet demands and reports of
a U.S. suggestion they do so.
   Although Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev now insists on
suspension rather than revocation of the March 11 action, Prime
Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene said either step would put the
republic back under Moscow's thumb.
   She met with Gorbachev on Thursday in Moscow, and Lithuania's
parliament held an emergency session Saturday in Vilnius, the
republic's capital, to hear about the latest efforts at compromise
in the standoff with the Kremlin over independence.
   As Mrs. Prunskiene addressed the lawmakers, about 10,000 singing
and flag-waving people rallied outside to show their support and to
protect the building from anti-independence activists, Vilnius
Radio reported.
   Gorbachev has said the other two Baltic republics, Estonia and
Latvia, violated the Soviet constitution with the steps they have
taken toward independence. But he has not imposed economic
sanctions on them, as he has against Lithuania.
   Gorbachev has cut off all oil and most of the natural gas
supplied to Lithuania, as well as some raw materials, for its
secessionist moves.
   ``We must take as many steps toward the other side as we can,''
Mrs. Prunskiene said, according to parliamentary spokesman Ed
Tuskenis.
   She noted that both Gorbachev and Secretary of State James A.
Baker III had urged a temporary suspension of the declaration of
independence, Tuskenis said. She met with Baker on Friday.
   Vice President Ceslovas Stankevicius, who was with Mrs.
Prunskiene during her meeting with Baker, told the lawmakers that
Baker's suggestion of a ``suspension does not mean an annulment''
of the declaration, Tuskenis said.
   But on Saturday, a senior U.S. official denied Baker had urged
Mrs. Prunskiene to suspend the declaration of independence.
   In fact, the official said, Baker had assured the Lithuanian
prime minister that the Bush administration wanted the independence
movement to succeed.
   ``Whatever decision you take, it is one we are going to
support,'' the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
quoted Baker as saying. ``This is exactly what he said.''
   Earlier, at a news conference in Moscow, Baker was asked whether
he had pressed Mrs. Prunskiene to retract the declaration.
   ``I did not press them,'' he said. ``I said dialogue was
important.''
   Tuskenis quoted Mrs. Prunskiene as saying her meeting with
Gorbachev, while being a difficult session, signaled a ``positive
evaluation'' in general because his position on the declaration had
moved ``from revocation to suspension.'' Gorbachev insisted,
however, that the declaration be suspended ``as a minimum''
requirement, she said.
   What remained unclear is whether suspension of the declaration
would mean that Soviet laws would go back in force in Lithuania,
she said.
   A suspension would be too risky, because Lithuania would revert
to ``the status of being the Lithuanian S.S.R. (Soviet Socialist
Republic), instead of the Republic of Lithuania,'' Tuskenis quoted
her as saying.
   Since March 11 and throughout the Kremlin economic embargo,
Lithuanian officials have refused to roll back on their
declaration. They have said that other issues, such as
pro-independence laws, may be negotiated.
   At a news conference in Moscow, Baker said Soviet and Lithuanian
leaders were working harder to find a way to settle their dispute
peacefully ``but they are not there yet.''
   After Mrs. Prunskiene's speech, lawmakers began to debate her
proposals, said Rita Dapkus, a parliamentary spokeswoman, but they
were not expected to take immediate action.
   Ms. Dapkus and Eduard Potashinskas, an editor at the Lithuanian
television station, said the crowd that gathered outside the
Supreme Council building included volunteers who were recruited to
guard the building against any actions by anti-independence
protesters.
   On Tuesday in Latvia and Estonia, crowds opposed to secession
from Moscow tried to enter those republics' parliaments but were
forced back by pro-independence supporters and local police.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass said the Soviet Interior
Ministry on Saturday dispatched extra units to the republics to
assist local authorities ``in working out and implementing concrete
measures on strengthening law and order.''
   Many Russians and other ethnic minorities in the Baltic
republics complain that they are discriminated against because of
the independence movements. The republics were forcibly annexed by
Josef Stalin in 1940.

   A federal Immigration and Naturalization
Service agent was charged with rape, kidnap and other crimes
involving four women, including one who said she was attacked after
refusing to prove she was a legal U.S. resident.
   James Edward Riley, 32, was arraigned in Van Nuys Municipal
Court Friday on charges stemming from three of the incidents that
took place in September, January and February.
   He pleaded innocent to one count each of rape, false
imprisonment by a police officer and assault by a police officer,
and two counts of kidnapping. Court Commissioner Rebecca
Omens-Rochman ordered Riley held without bail pending a May 25
preliminary hearing.
   Earlier last week, Riley was arrested in the fourth case and
pleaded innocent to the April 11 kidnap and rape of a 23-year-old
woman.
   Authorities say that woman refused Riley's demand to prove she
was a legal U.S. resident, after which he allegedly handcuffed her,
took her to his Los Angeles apartment and raped her at gunpoint.
   A search through police reports for similar crimes led to
Riley's being charged in the three earlier cases, said Deputy
District Attorney James Baker.
   INS spokesman Joe Flanders said Riley was placed on unpaid leave
while the INS conducts its own investigation.

   Summer Squall outran Kentucky Derby winner
Unbridled to capture the Preakness Stakes on Saturday, dashing
racing fans' hopes of a Triple Crown winner this year.
   Summer Squall, avenging his second-place finish in the May 5
Derby, charged down the stretch to cross under the wire two lengths
ahead of Unbridled. The winning time for the mile and
three-sixteenths race was 1:53 3-5, just one-fifth of a second off
the track record.
   Mister Frisky, who had been unbeaten until his eighth-place
finish in the Derby, ran third in the field of nine colts at
Pimlico.
   Summer Squall, ridden by jockey Pat Day, won $445,900 for his
day's work to boost his career earnings to $1,330,978. The colt
will get a much-deserved rest and will sit out the June 9 Belmont
Stakes, said trainer Neal Howard. Summer Squall is owned by a
28-person partnership managed by Dogwood Stable.
   Only 11 horses have won racing's Tripe Crown _ the Derby, the
Preakness and the Belmont _ and none since Affirmed in 1978.

   Two light aircraft collided in flight
south of London on Saturday, killing four people, officials said.
Witnesses reported that a fifth person leaped with a parachute from
one plane as it fell.
   The other plane, a Piper Cherokee, fell in a school playing
field a few yards from children. Five children were treated for
shock.
   Police and tracking dogs searched woods near the crash site
looking for the missing person. One witness said the person's
parachute only partially opened.
   Motorists on the major M25 beltway circling London saw the Piper
and the 1930s Tiger Moth crash. They fell to the ground on both
sides of the highway at Upper Gatton near the turnoff to Reigate,
20 miles south of central London.
   Four people were killed, including three in the Piper and one in
the Tiger Moth, according to the Civil Aviation Authority. It
released no details of other casualties.
   The crash occurred about three miles from Redhill Aerodrome in
Surrey, in one of the busiest stretches of airspace in the south.
   A spokeswoman for the Redhill air field said the Tiger Moth had
taken off from Redhill and the Piper Cherokee was returning from a
local flight.
   Two boys about 12 years old said they saw someone jump with a
parachute from the Tiger Moth.
   An adult living in the area confirmed the sighting and told
police the person's parachute had only partially opened.

   An opposition environmental group has
filed the country's first lawsuit against the government, which is
controlled by former communists, the state news agency reported
Saturday.
   The Ecoglasnost environment group has taken its case to the
Supreme Court, seeking revocation of a government decision to
expand a forestry project, the BTA news agency said.
   Few details of the case were provided by the terse official
report. The report said the suit was filed against the Council of
Ministers.
   ``The summons was filed under No. 1, which shows that the suit
will be the first of its kind,'' BTA said.
   The formation of opposition groups and cautious reforms toward
multiparty democracy began after the Nov. 9 ouster of longtime
Communist leader Todor Zhivkov.
   Ecoglasnost is a member of the 16-party Union of Democratic
Forces, an alliance that has vowed to defeat the former communists,
who changed their party name to the Socialist Party. The first
multiparty elections in postwar Bulgaria are set for June 10.

<HEAD>First Plastic U.S. Stamp Goes On Sale, through Cash Machines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARRIE FIGDOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's first plastic stamp _ one that takes
no licking to keep it sticking _ went on sale Saturday through
automated teller machines at banks.
   Over the next six months, 22 ATMs in the Seattle area will
dispense the limited-edition, 25-cent stamps in a test to see
whether people will buy them and if banks want to sell them, said
U.S. Postmaster General Anthony Frank.
   ``We think ATM stamps represent a good idea and a technological
milestone,'' Frank said at a first-day-of-issue ceremony Friday.
   The stamps, which feature an abstract American flag, need no
moisture to stick. You simply peel one off a sheet of backing and
post it on your letter.
   They are humidity and tear-resistant, and were designed to have
the thickness of a dollar bill, to be dispensed through 24-hour
bank machines.
   The 10-layer stamp is basically a polyester film over a
pressure-adhesive with a water-soluble primer. Less than
five-thousandths of an inch thick, it is dispensed in sheets of 12,
roughly the size of a dollar bill.
   It is not biodegradable, but can be soaked off envelopes and
recycled by companies that deal with mixed materials, said Alan
Gotcher, vice president in charge of corporate research for the
stamp's developer, Avery International Corp. The company makes
pressure adhesives.
   If the marketing test succeeds, Avery plans to seek a contract
to make up to 1 billion of the stamps, Gotcher said. He said the
company has patents on some of the technology to develop the
adhesive but not on the stamp itself.
   The Postal Service and Seafirst Bank came up with the idea of
the bank-dispensed stamp. Harry Zelenko of New York City designed
it.
   The ultimate goal is to develop a similar stamp made of
recyclable paper, Frank said.
   At Friday's ceremony in Seattle's Columbia-Seafirst Tower,
people lined up to buy first-day covers. The festivities also
included a jazz band, an honor guard and a Seafirst choral group.
   Only 2 million of the stamps have been printed, so they are
likely to become a valuable collectors' item, said Jim Hall, a
member of the Collectors Club of Seattle and a part-time stamp
dealer.
   ``It's quite innovative. It's just a test stamp so it will be
above average in value, more valuable than other commemorative
stamps,'' said Hall, who bought 30 sheets and 15 first-day covers.
   He estimated that one of the stamps could be worth a dollar
within a few years.

<HEAD>Commission Continues Work on Health Care Priority List</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oregon's health officials met Saturday to
rework a health care rationing plan that ranked crooked teeth near
the top of its list and AIDS treatment near the bottom.
   The Oregon Health Care Commission's draft list of medical
priorities was widely rebuked when it was released earlier this
month. Even panel members admitted that major surgery was needed on
the way the computerized list ranked certain illnesses.
   Oregon's Medicaid reform plan was designed to increase the
number of people who receive basic health care by limiting the most
expensive and least effective treatments.
   After 11 public hearings and 50 community meetings, the
commission devised a formula in which the cost of treatment was
divided by the duration of benefits and the quality of well-being,
a factor that measures how a patient would fare with treatment as
opposed to without treatment.
   The formula was applied to some 1,600 medical procedures and fed
into a computer. The result was a document so loaded with errors
the commission considered withholding it.
   ``It's a ponderous, complicated, almost overwhelming collection
of data, but we had to start somewhere,'' said commission chairman
Bill Gregory in releasing the list May 2.
   On Saturday, the panel heard from invited health care
professionals in its efforts to rework the list. On Sunday, the
commission planned to continue working on the flaws of the list.
   Craig Irwin, of the Oregon Transplant Project, criticized the
list as incomplete and inaccurate, both in cost analyses and
treatment alternatives. Irwin also said the ranking failed to
consider the human factor in treating illness.
   The panel had hoped to submit the list to Gov. Neil Goldschmidt
by July 1.
   But Brad Buvinger, of the consumer action organization Oregon
Fair Share, urged the panel to take its time in preparing the list,
rather than bend to pressure from the public and the Oregon
Legislature.
   ``Don't get too carried away with that list,'' warned panel
member Yayoe Kuramitsu. ``We haven't even started to sort through
it.''
   One of the few encouraging witnesses was Dr. Ralph Crawshaw, of
the medical consulting firm Oregon Health Decisions.
   Although he criticized the way the news media had reacted to the
raw list, Crawshaw said, ``The open and complete disclosure of the
(committee's) actions ... is probably the most powerful insurance
that the final report will have wide public acceptance.''
   Rather than reworking the list, the panel discussed whether a
different formula might yield a more useful ranking.
   Dr. Harvey Klevit said the panel ought to consider whether the
duration factor ought to be the same when a medical condition is
treated or not treated. He cited the example of a cancer patient,
who may live five years with treatment and only two years without
treatment.
   On the other hand, Klevit questioned whether a chicken pox
patient would receive any long-range benefit since the disease
would probably go away with or without treatment.
   Dr. Richard Wopat questioned whether the panel was wasting its
time on trying to find the perfect formula.
   ``I like the idea of science and using an objective formula,''
said Wopat. ``But health care doesn't lend itself to formulas.''
   Dr. Tina Castanares of Hood River and Dr. Paul Kirk of Portland
agreed that it was worthwhile for the panel to rework the formula.
   ``Maybe we're not applying science (to the list), but we're
applying fairness,'' said Castanares.
   State welfare officials estimate the completed plan will add
77,000 new clients to the current list of 130,000 Medicaid
recipients. Before it can go into effect, Oregon must get
permission from Congress or the Department of Health and Human
Services to alter its Medicaid program.

   A rural florist vilified by his
neighbors because they wrongly believed he had AIDS was robbed and
assaulted Saturday, authorities said.
   Bill Grealis, 41, was struck in the head and had his left arm
slashed by an assailant, said Sgt. W.G. Slimick of the Kanawha
County Sheriff's Department said.
   The attacker painted ``AIDS'' on the wall and other epithets on
the cooler in Grealis' shop in Campbells Creek, said his wife,
Diana.
   ``I just don't care anymore,'' said Grealis. ``They've ruined my
life, they've ruined my business, they've taken my dignity. I don't
have anything left.''
   No arrests have been made, Slimick said.
   Grealis was taken to Charleston Area Medical Center, where he
received six stitches in his arm.
   Grealis was terrorized by people in the small mining community
of 300 people since last December, after he lost 50 pounds from
prostrate problems and split with his wife of 22 years.
   He said the tires of his van were slashed earlier and ``AIDS''
scrawled on the side of the vehicle.
   Last Monday, Grealis and state Attorney General Roger Tompkins
announced at a news conference that Grealis was free of the deadly
acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   The florist posted his clean bill of health on the shop window
to convince those who shunned him that he is AIDS-free.
   ``I've had people who have seen me in the grocery store coming
down the same aisle and turn around and go the other way, people
that I've known up here for 22 years,'' he said Monday.
   Grealis said he was nearly forced into bankruptcy and at one
point considered suicide because of the smear campaign.
   Tompkins, who vowed to send investigators ``up and down this
hollow until we are satisfied that this nonsense is going to
stop,'' could not be reached for comment Saturday. He did not
immediately return a message left on the answering machine at his
home.
   ``I shouldn't have left him alone, but I did,'' said Diana
Grealis, who is separated from her husband but accompanied him at
the shop earlier in the day.
   ``They have their nerve. This was in broad daylight,'' said Mrs.
Grealis.
   Grealis said he went into a back room and felt a burning
sensation on his arm. Knocked unconscious, he came to moments later
with a bump on the back of his head and the cut on his arm, he said.
   Grealis said he did not see his attacker.
   ``The law better get 'em before I find out who they are. I'm
going to blow a hole right through 'em. I just can't fight
anymore.''
   Grealis said he received no threats Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday, but got menacing telephone calls Friday night and
Saturday.
   An investigator from the Kanawha County sheriff's department
escorted him home Friday night, said Mrs. Grealis, who remained
vigilant.
   ``I'm in here to fight 'em.''

   A federal prosecutor said Saturday he would
discuss bringing civil rights charges against a white youth
acquitted of murder in the death of a black teen-ager.
   U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney said he and District Attorney
Charles Hynes would consider statements made to reporters by a
woman who said she witnessed the killing of Yusuf Hawkins.
   Her comments were publicized Friday after a jury acquitted Keith
Mondello, 19, of murder and manslaughter charges. He was found
guilty of 12 lesser charges, including riot, unlawful imprisonment
and discrimination.
   Prosecutors charged Mondello with being the ringleader of a mob
that attacked Hawkins and three black friends when they went to the
predominantly white neighborhood of Bensonhurst looking for a used
car.
   ``I understand a new witness has come forward,'' Maloney told
The Associated Press in a telephone interview. ``I will be
discussing with Mr. Hynes to find out if anything can or should be
done.''
   The woman told reporters that she heard Mondello urge
co-defendant Joseph Fama to shoot the 16-year-old.
   Fama, 19, was convicted Thursday of second-degree murder in the
killing of Hawkins by a second jury that heard the same testimony.
Fama was accused of being the trggerman in the Aug. 23 attack.
   The 50-year-old woman, who asked to be identified only as
``Maria,'' claimed she didn't come forward earlier because she
feared retribution. She said she tried to telephone the judge who
presided over the case last week, but a court clerk rebuffed her
because she refused to give her name.
   She told reporters Friday that she saw Fama hesitate, then shoot
Hawkins when Mondello reportedly said, ``Shoot him, he's just a
nigger.''
   Maloney, in dicussing possible civil rights charges, cautioned
that the federal government's jurisdiction for civil rights
prosecution was limited. The law requires ``some effect on
interstate commerce, (for example), prohibiting someone from using
a lunch diner or rioting on a bus,'' he said.
   ``There has never been a prosecution authorized since the bill
was passed 25 years ago for simply racial assaults involving people
walking down the street,'' he said.
   Patrick Clark, a spokesman for the district attorney, refused to
comment when asked if authorities had talked to the woman or
investigated her remarks.
   Supporters of the Hawkins family took to the street Friday night
after the Mondello verdict, but there was little violence. Five
local television news employees received minor injuries in attacks
by demonstrators.
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, an activist who has been an adviser to
Hawkins' parents, said Saturday that he did not condone the attacks
on the TV crews.
   ``We must continue to go to Bensonhurst until people know that
anybody of our race has a right to go anywhere in this nation that
we helped build,'' he said at a news conference before addressing a
rally.
   Sharpton later led about 500 marchers through Bensonhurst,
starting from the corner where Hawkins was killed. About 500 local
residents, mostly young people, lined the route.
   ``No peace! No peace!'' and ``Yusuf! Yusuf!'' the marchers
chanted. ``Murderers! Murderers!''
   ``Animals!'' the spectators yelled back.
   Some youths threw watermelons at the marchers. Others spit at
them.
   ``My grandfather owned your grandfather!'' shouted Dylano
Marchetti.
   But other local residents sounded a conciliatory note.
   Parishioners of the Lefferts Park Baptist Church stood along the
route holding signs that read, ``Pray for the peace of Brooklyn,''
and ``Bensonhurst is not guilty but grieved.''
   ``I don't believe that a few speak for the majority,'' David
Schulter, the church's pastor, said of the shouting youths beside
him.
   About 500 police officers lined the 10-block march route, but
authorities said there were no arrests or major incidents.
   Meanwhile, prosecutors geared up for their case against Joseph
Vento, 21, one of five white males still awaiting trial on
second-degree murder and other charges for their part in the mob
that surrounded Hawkins.
   A sixth defendant is charged with first-degree assault.
   Vento is scheduled for a pretrial hearing at trial-level state
Supreme Court on Monday, Clark said Saturday.
   After the killing, Vento told investigators he saw Fama shoot
Hawkins and was granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for
his testimony.
   But late last year, he fled the city. After surrendering in Ohio
in March, Vento backed out of the deal and was indicted by a grand
jury.
   ``We want the judge to push this case,'' Assistant District
Attorney Edward Boyar told the Daily News. ``It's certainly our
strongest case. Vento hangs himself.''

<HEAD>Report: Israel Promises No First Strike Against Arabs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel told Egypt it will not launch a first
military strike on any Arab nation, a government official said
Saturday.
   Israel refused to confirm or deny it had made any new assurances
but said its longstanding policy is not to start any wars.
   However, in June 1981, Israeli warplanes bombed and destroyed an
Iraqi nuclear reactor on the outskirts of the capital, Baghdad.
   Egypt may have elicited the reported promise to allay Arab fears
that Israel was preparing to launch a military strike on Iraq to
cripple its burgeoning weapons industry.
   The Egyptian government official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Israel gave the assurance in recent contacts with
President Hosni Mubarak's government. He refused to give details.
   The official's statement followed a report distributed by
Egypt's state Middle East News Agency. The agency said it had
learned from unidentified sources that in a ``recent contact,''
Israel gave Egypt ``a promise that it will not be the first to
attack any Arab state.''
   It said Israel also told Cairo that it was ``anxious for the
continuation of the peace process with Egypt and for the
achievement of peace with other Arab countries.''
   Avi Pazner, a spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, said Saturday that Israel sought to ``reach out and change
its relationship'' with Arab countries but did not confirm or deny
the report about new assurances.
   Pazner, reached by telephone, said: ``It is our longstanding
policy for the last 42 years, since Israel's founding, never to
attack an Arab state.''
   Egypt and Israel signed a U.S.-sponsored peace treaty in 1979.
The Egyptians thus became the first and remain the only Arab people
not in a state of war with the Jewish state.
   Egyptian officials said Mubarak, in direct talks or diplomatic
contacts with Western leaders, has been trying to defuse a crisis
involving their relations with Iraq.
   Since April, Britain and several other European countries have
impounded Iraq-bound parts of what they characterized as a ``super
gun'' capable of firing nuclear or chemical warheads hundreds of
miles to Iranian or Israeli territory. Iraq has denied having or
developing nuclear arms.
   In a speech last month, President Saddam Hussein of Iraq said he
would destroy half of Israel with chemical weapons from his arsenal
if Israel mounted a nuclear attack on Iraq.
   The Iraqi leader has accused Israel and the West of trying to
undermine his efforts to build a strong military arsenal.

   Two detained pro-democracy activists were released
on bail Saturday, an Interior Ministry spokesman announced.
   Opposition sources said former legislator Ahmed al-Rabei was
released from a hospital, where he was recovering from an asthma
attack. He was admitted to the hospital while in custody.
   The other released detainee was Ali Bouerki, a businessman, the
sources said.
   The two men were detained for holding an illegal meeting. They
were released on $1,000 bail.
   Bouerki owned a hall where about 50 to 60 people had gathered
last Sunday to listen to al-Rabei protest government plans to
institute a National Assembly made up of 25 government appointees
and 50 elected members.
   The body is to replace the freely elected Parliament, which was
suspended in 1986 after deputies harshly criticized government
ministers.
   The two men, and 13 others arrested on similar charges, can
still be recalled by the prosecutor and formally charged.
   Thirty-two of 50 members of the former parliament are pressing
for the body's restoration. They been urging people to boycott June
10 elections to the National Assembly.

   ``The bus was going at an absurdly fast speed, and the driver
obviously lost control,'' said police officer Carlos Campos.
   He said no other vehicle was involved.
   The afternoon accident occurred near the town of
Itaquaquecetuba, about 40 miles from Sao Paulo. The bus was on a
local route and carried a total of 63 people.
   Campos said the bus fell 66 feet and landed on part of the Rio
de Janeiro-Sao Paulo railroad tracks.
   TV Globo, Brazil's largest network, showed the overturned bus
with its wheels in the air and its roof caved in.
   Campos said the injured were being treated at several hospitals
throughout the region.

   Golden Neck won by more than a beak,
Drumstick took the bantamweight prize and Judy ``thoroughly
disgraced herself'' by flying the wrong way at Saturday's 20th
annual Chicken Flying Meet.
   Golden Neck, who weighs 31 ounces, became this year's
featherweight champion with a flight of 278 feet 4 inches, said
Carol Crabtree, spokeswoman for Bob Evans Farm, which sponsors the
annual display of avian acrobatics here.
   ``We feel pretty badly about Judy,'' said Ms. Crabtree. ``She
thoroughly disgraced herself by flying backwards. She landed on a
tent top and had to be rescued.''
   But none of the 197 entrants beat Judy's 1989 all-time flying
record of 542 feet 9 inches. Judy's owner, John Salyers of
Galloway, vowed she'd return to fly again.
   Frankie, who weighs 68 ounces and is owned by Lloyd Danner of
Gallipolis, won the heavyweight title with a flight of 36 feet 5
inches.
   Drumstick, coached by Leon Okes of Parkersburg, W.Va., became
bantamweight champ by coasting 129 feet 4 inches.
   And Citizen Kane, sponsored by The Athens News newspaper, took
the medium weight title with a flight of 127 feet 4 inches.
   Golden Neck, owned by Roger Gearing of Londonderry, and the
other title winners got $100 and a ribbon.

<TEXT>
   President Bush welcomed the outcome of arms
talks in Moscow on Saturday as ``a major step forward'' in improved
U.S.-Soviet relations and a ``breakthrough'' toward a reduction in
nuclear weapons.
   In a commencement address at the University of Texas, Bush
heralded progress reported earlier in the day by Secretary of State
James A. Baker III after four days of talks in Moscow.
   ``While there is additional work to be done, I think Jim Baker's
meetings represent a major step forward,'' the president said.
   ``This breakthrough should allow us to reach the important goal
we set in Malta _ completing the major substantive elements of an
historic strategic arms reduction treaty.
   ``In addition,'' Bush added, ``we will be able to conclude other
arms control measures with the Soviets, including an agreement on
dramatic reductions in chemical weapons, as well as technical and
commercial agreements.
   ``I am confident that the progress we have made will allow this
summit to be another solid step forward in the vital U.S.-Soviet
relationship.''
   Earlier in Houston, Bush had pronounced himself encouraged by
the progress of the Moscow talks, but said it will ``take some
give'' from the Soviet Union for his upcoming summit with Mikhail
S. Gorbachev to be a success.
   ``We still have some unfulfilled arms control problems I think
we're all familiar with,'' Bush told reporters as he toured the
site of July's seven-nation economic summit.
   Bush also visited an area hard hit by floods and was
participating in a celebrity golf tournament.
   The president gave what he called ``a mixed review'' on the
outcome of Baker's pre-summit arms negotiations with Soviet leaders.
   ``Some encouraging things and some things that still remain to
be solved,'' Bush said.
   In Moscow, Baker announced that a ``trailblazing'' agreement had
been reached on banning chemical weapons and that major disputes
had been resolved on cutting long-range nuclear weapons.
   However, Baker conceded a failure to break a stalemate on
reducing troops and tanks in Europe.
   Bush, speaking to reporters at the John Kirby Mansion, the
headquarters for the Houston economic summit, said, ``We want the
Gorbachev summit to be successful. It's going to take some give on
the Soviet side in my view. But we're going to keep pushing.''
   Bush did not elaborate.
   The president said his national security adviser, Brent
Scowcroft, planned to be in touch with Baker later in the day to
get more details on the talks.
   Scowcroft later told reporters aboard Air Force One that the
tentative accord on cruise missiles is ``a breakthrough in the
sense that cruise missiles are the major elements that still have
to be resolved in order to say we could conclude a START treaty.''
   He cautioned that such a treaty probably will not be ready for
signing at the upcoming summit, but said the details yet to be
worked out are not the kind of things ``we would consider treaty
stoppers.''
   ``Indeed, most of them don't have to go to the heads of
government at all,'' said Scowcroft.
   As to conventional weapons in Europe, Scowcroft said the concern
is that the Soviets ``are now stonewalling'' on reductions.
   In the commencement speech, Bush also said ``the free world is
now more vast than anyone dared imagine'' and challenged the
students to ``live a life of adventure and meaning so brilliant
that like a Roman candle, it lights up the world.''
   ``Dazzle us. Astonish us. Be extraordinary,'' Bush said.
   He called on the graduates to ``spend your life doing'' after
years of learning. ``Make your Czech or Polish lessons work for the
Citizens Democracy Corps, put your Spanish in the service of the
Peace Corps, or work with VISTA right here in our precious USA.
Care for AIDS babies.''
   In earlier comments to reporters on the economic summit, the
president said this year's annual meeting among leaders of the
United States, Britain, Japan, France, West Germany, Italy and
Canada was ``taking place at a fascinating time as we see the
evolution of democracy in Eastern Europe.''
   Bush also made a helicopter tour of flooded areas near Houston.
He stopped briefly at the spillway of Livingston Dam, about 75
miles northeast of here, where overflowing waters from Lake
Livingston and the Trinity River had forced hundreds of people on
both sides of the dam out of their homes.
   After flying over the region by helicopter, Bush talked with
local flood workers and surveyed the surging waters beneath the
dam, which submerged a recreation and boat launching area.
   Bush greeted several dozen onlookers and commented that
``fortunately it isn't a highly concentrated residential area _ it
isn't like a city is under water.''
   Noting the emergency assistance available through the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, he said, ``The federal government
wants to be very responsive.''
   Torrential rains have driven thousands of people from their
homes over the past few weeks in Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas.
Flooding has caused at least 13 deaths in Texas as dozens of square
miles have been inundated.
   The president has declared a federal disaster in Texas.
Thirty-eight counties have been included in the region eligible for
federal disaster loans and grants.
   After surveying the floodwaters, Bush flew by helicopter to the
Deerwood County Club outside Houston to participate in the Doug
Sanders Celebrity Golf Tournament with his son George Bush, a part
owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team.
   Also playing were two former astronauts, Alan B. Shepard and
Eugene A. Cernan.
   ``This is a tough golf course,'' Bush, an avid if uneven golfer,
said as he began the tournament. ``Please don't laugh at the drive
off the first tee.''
   Bush also was to give speeches in Portland, Ore., and Los
Angeles before returning to Washington on Monday.

   A barrage of rockets slammed into
residential areas of the Afghan capital Kabul on Saturday, killing
two people and wounding 27, state-run radio reported.
   Kabul Radio accused ``Pakistan-based extremists'' of firing 22
surface-to-surface rockets into the city's southern and western
districts. The term ``extremists'' refers to the Moslem guerrillas
who have been trying for 12 years to overthrow Afghanistan's
Soviet-backed government.
   The radio, monitored in Islamabad, said rockets struck near the
vacant Japanese and West German embassies. It said a rocket also
hit near the residence of the International Committee of the Red
Cross staff but did not say if there were any casualties there.
   Also Saturday, Afghan guerrillas claimed they shot down a
government fighter jet and seized a large cache of weapons in
fighting outside the southern city of Kandahar.
   MIDIA, the official news agency of the Afghan resistance, said
the U.S.-backed guerrillas captured tanks, armored personnel
carriers and military trucks during their weeklong assault on
security posts ringing Kandahar's airport.
   Several Afghan soldiers and about a dozen guerrillas were killed
in the fighting, MIDIA said.
   Claims by the guerrillas and the Afghan government are
impossible to verify independently.
   Citing security concerns, Japan, West Germany and other
countries closed their missions in Kabul just weeks before the last
Soviet soldiers left Afghanistan in February 1989 and ended nine
years of direct military involvement.
   Last week, a rocket hit in the compound of the closed U.S.
Embassy, located near the radio station. Hundreds of people have
been killed in rocket attacks on the capital in recent years.
   The guerrillas, supported by the United States, Saudi Arabia and
other Arab states, insist they target only military installations
but admit they sometimes misfire and hit residential areas.

   Groups of black men shouting references to the
white-on-black Bensonhurst killing attacked whites and Hispanics in
two incidents early Saturday, police said.
   A jury Friday found Keith Mondello, a white 19-year-old,
innocent of murder and manslaughter in the killing of Yusuf
Hawkins, a black 16-year-old, in the Bensonhurst section of
Brooklyn.
   At 12:30 a.m., 12 to 20 blacks shouting ``For Yusuf'' and
``White boys, you don't belong here,'' assaulted two white men just
north of Times Square in Manhattan, said Sgt. Mary Wrensen.
   The victims ran away and called police, while the group
assaulted four other white men and a man and woman who tried to
intervene, Wrensen said.
   Police arrested Alan Janurris, 39, Kenneth Smith, 22, Kevin
Richardson, 19, and Eugene Martinez, 19, said Wrensen. They were
charged with assault, riot, aggravated harassment and reckless
endangerment, she said.
   The victims were treated for minor cuts and bruises, she said.
   At about 12:45 a.m., about 15 black men shouting ``Mondello got
off'' attacked two Hispanic men in the Canarsie section of
Brooklyn, Wrensen said.
   One of the men was robbed and suffered a broken nose, she said.
   No arrests were made.
   Mondello was convicted of 12 lesser charges on Friday, including
riot, unlawful imprisonment and discrimination. Another jury on
Thursday found Mondello co-defendant Joseph Fama, also white and
also 19, guilty of second-degree murder in the Aug. 23 killing.

   Report: Scientific Panel Looking at Dumping Iron in Ocean to Slow
Warming
</TEXT>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A special panel of the National Research
Council has given quiet endorsement to a proposal by several
scientists to battle the ``greenhouse effect'' by dumping iron into
the oceans to stimulate plant growth, according to a published
report.
   The Washington Post says in Sunday's editions that the panel
concluded ``it is conceptually feasible to slow the increase in
atmospheric carbon dioxide'' by fertilizing the oceans with iron.
   The idea is that the iron would stimulate growth of marine
algae, which in turn would soak up some of the excess carbon
dioxide in the air that is believed to be responsible for global
warming.
   The Post said the panel's report, which has not been made
public, recommends that ``after careful modeling and appropriate
preliminary experiments,'' a large international ``iron enrichment
experiment'' be implemented at a cost of between $50 million and
$150 million.
   It says researchers have suggested that the first experiment be
conducted off the coast of Antarctica or Alaska.
   The National Research Council is an arm of the National
Academies of Sciences and Engineering, which is an independent
organization chartered by Congress to advise the government on
scientific, medical and technical issues.
   ``You give me half a tanker full of iron, I'll give you another
ice age,'' said John Martin of Moss Landing Marine Laboratories in
California, one of several private scientists quoted by the Post.
   ``I think it is a good idea,'' said Roger Revelle, former
director of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. ``I see no
reason why it shouldn't work.''
   A third scientist quoted by the paper, Anthony Michaels of the
Bermuda Biological Station for Research, said, ``There are lots of
unknowns, but it is an enticing idea that is being actively
pursued.''

<HEAD>Report: Government to Tell How Much It Paid Noriega</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials plan to declare how much money
the United States paid Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, according to a
published report.
   The New York Times reported Sunday that the U.S. government will
disclose the amount at a federal court hearing in Miami on Monday.
   The amount, an unidentified government official told the Times,
is far less than the $11 million Noriega's chief defense lawyer
says the former Panamanian dictator claims to have been paid.
   The lawyer, Frank A. Rubino, said part of his case might include
videotaped testimony from Cuban President Fidel Castro.
   Rubino told the Times he hopes to show that Noriega carried out
many apparently illegal activities with the compliance, and
sometimes assistance, of American intelligence agencies.
   The lawyer said he intends to subpoena current and former
American intelligence officials, as well as classified documents,
to support his client's contention that he was acting as an agent
of the United States.
   ``I will show that, sure, he did some not-nice things, but that
he did them as part of operations that he was carrying out for our
government,'' Rubino told the newspaper.
   Federal prosecutors have not moved yet to block, on national
security grounds, the introduction of classified material in the
case against Noriega.
   Noriega, after years of being a paid American agent, was seized
in December after U.S. troops invaded Panama. Noriega was indicted
by two grand juries in Florida in 1988 on a dozen counts of cocaine
trafficking and racketeering involving shipment of drugs to the
United States.
   Rubino said Castro gave him documents that would help Noriega's
defense. The Times report did not say what those documents might be
or contain.

<HEAD>Former Urban League President Warns Against Bush Veto of Civil
Rights Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former head of the National Urban League
said Saturday that President Bush risks widespread protests and
destruction of his popularity among blacks if he vetoes civil
rights legislation pending before Congress.
   ``Black people may have forgiven George Bush for the Willie
Horton ads, but there will be no forgiveness for vetoing a bill
that saves basic civil rights from the tender mercies of the Reagan
Supreme Court,'' Jordan told the George Mason University graduating
class in suburban Fairfax, Va.
   ``A veto would unleash a firestorm of protest that would
permanently rupture the administration's credibility and galvanize
black people and white people who believe in the power of the law
to right the wrongs of racism,'' he said.
   Critics said 1988 presidential campaign ads to boost Bush's
image as a tough-on-crime candidate were racist in their use of
Horton, a black convicted killer who raped a woman while on
furlough from a Massachusetts prison.
   Jordan served as the league's president from 1972 to 1981.
   Leaders of major civil rights organizations have urged Bush not
to veto the Civil Rights Act of 1990 that would overturn several
controversial 1989 Supreme Court decisions in the area of
employment discrimination.
   However Bush last week said he objected to key provisions of the
proposal that could lead to hiring quotas.

<TEXT>
   Actress Judy Carne was arrested at Kennedy
International Airport on an 11-year-old warrant discovered by
customs agents, officials said Saturday.
   Carne, who gained fame in the 1960s as the ``sock-it-to-me''
star of television's ``Laugh-In,'' was arrested at about 7:30 p.m.
Friday, said Lt. Arthur Sweet, a Port Authority Police spokesman.
   Carne was checking in with the U.S. Customs Service, having just
returned from another country, when the warrant was discovered,
Sweet said. The warrant from Hamilton County, Ohio, sought Carne on
charges of illegal possession of drug documents and drug abuse.
   Police did not know which country Carne, the former wife of Burt
Reynolds, had been visiting.
   From the airport, she was taken to Queens central booking but
was then transferred to City Hospital Center in Elmhurst when she
became ill, Sweet said.
   After a brief stay at the hospital, she was returned to the
booking center and was arraigned Saturday night, officials said.
She was being held on $500 bail, which she had not yet posted, they
said.
   Carne's career after ``Laugh-In'' went into a tailspin because
of drug problems. In 1987, she was fined for trying to smuggle a
fraction of an ounce of cocaine into Britain.
   Most recently, she has tried a comeback as a singer and cabaret
artist.
   Ohio officials said they would take action to extradite Carne,
Sweet said.

<HEAD>Koreans Mount Daily Protest at Japanese Embassy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korean protesters held a sit-in
in front of the Japanese Embassy on Friday for the fifth
consecutive day to demand an apology by Japan's emperor for
colonial rule of Korea.
   Some of their placards asked President Roh Tae-woo to cancel his
three-day visit to Japan next week. Roh has been under mounting
public pressure to put off the visit unless Emperor Akihito makes
such an apology.
   The protesters, relatives of Koreans drafted by Japan and killed
during World War II, were demanding an apology and compensation for
Japan's wartime acts.
   The protest began Monday, when about a dozen people, all more
than 50 years old, sat on the ground about 15 yards from the
embassy's main gate, shouting ``Akihito, apologize!'' About 60 riot
police guarded the embassy, but there have been no arrests.
   The protesters gather in the morning and stay several hours
after nightfall, reading statements and chanting slogans.
   Minor scuffles have broken out only when the protesters
screaming slogans try to run after cars carrying Japanese
diplomats. Some irate protesters hurled eggs on Thursday.
   The late Emperor Hirohito, who died in January 1989, said in
1984 he sincerely regretted that there was an unfortunate past
between the two countries.
   However, South Korean officials have said the apology was
unclear to the Korean people.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan has said he will apologize
to the Korean people next week. But Japanese officials have
resisted calls for Akihito to make a formal apology, saying the
emperor, the symbol of the Japanese state, should not be used for
political purposes.
   Anti-Japanese sentiment is strong among many elderly Koreans who
remember Japan's harsh colonial rule. Following the Russo-Japanese
war, Japan annexed Korea in 1910 and controlled it until the end of
World War II.
   During the war, Japan drafted hundreds of thousands of Koreans
as soldiers and forced laborers.
   In Japan on Friday, authorities reported two suspected arson
attacks linked to Roh's visit.
   Three cars were destroyed in one attack by suspected leftist
extremists at a state police headquarters in Omiya, just north of
Tokyo, police said.
   Local authorities reported a separate fire at housing facilities
for South Korean residents in Nagoya, central Japan, on Thursday
evening.
   No one was reported injured in either incident, and only minor
damage was reported to the building.
   Radical extremist groups that oppose Roh's visit claim it is a
step toward reviving the Japanese empire as it existed earlier in
the century.

<HEAD>Scientists May Have Found Crater from Giant Meteorite</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers say they may have found the 65
million-year-old crater left by a giant meteorite that some
scientists blame for the extinction of the dinosaurs.
   Traces of a hole 180 miles across have been found beneath the
Caribbean Sea, two University of Arizona researchers report in
Friday's journal Science. They suggested an asteroid or comet fell
to the seafloor 3 miles below the ocean's surface and plunged 50
miles into the Earth's mantle.
   Planetary sciences Professor William V. Boynton and Alan R.
Hildebrand, a doctoral candidate in planetary sciences, theorized
the impact created a wave, up to three miles high, that dumped
debris in what is now Mexico and throughout the southern and
eastern United States.
   At least since 1980, late physicist Luis Alvarez, his son,
Walter, and others theorized that most of the dinosaurs might have
been wiped out as a result of a giant asteroid or comet striking
the Earth.
   ``I'm only cautiously optimistic,'' Walter Alvarez, an earth
sciences professor at the University of California-Berkeley, said
by telephone Friday. ``If it is, indeed, the impact site, then we
have the smoking gun. We would like to find the site, that would
tie up the theory.''
   The researchers analyzed 65-million-year-old rock samples from
surface and deep-sea holes around the world for signs of debris
tossed up by the impact.
   ``I think the evidence is compelling that the impact had to be
somewhere in this region,'' Hildebrand said Thursday of the area
about 180 miles northwest of what is now Colombia.
   The pair has identified a possible impact crater, which they
believe to be 180 miles in diameter _ about twice the size of any
known crater from terrestrial impact.

   Deaths: 13
   Injuries: Undetermined.
   Damages: At least 4,000 homes damaged. State officials will not
release estimate of public lands damaged until they get more
information. Residential estimates in north Texas from earlier
flooding are at $60 million.
   Losses: Officials estimate agriculture losses at up to $700
million.
   Livestock losses: Undetermined.
   Evacuations: At least 389 people in southeast Texas since
flooding began.
   Status of rivers: Trinity River at Goodrich, just below Lake
Livingston, 46.5 feet, 10 feet above bank and expected to remain
for several days. At Liberty, 28.8 feet, flood stage 24 feet,
expected to crest and stay at crest of 29.5 for several days.

   Damages: Undetermined number of homes damaged; some parish roads
closed because of flooding; more than 110,000 acres flooded and
more than 80,000 acres of farmland.
   Losses: Crops lost are winter wheat and cotton. In northwest
Louisiana, damage is estimated at $6.5 million to $7 million in
Caddo, Bossier, Red River, Natchitoches and Desoto parishes.
Officials say that does not include costs of rebuilding or

   Livestock losses: None.
   Evacuations: Approximately 360 people evacuated.
   Status of rivers: The Red, which crested Tuesday in Shreveport
at 34.5 feet, was down to 32.4 feet _ 2.4 feet above flood stage _
on Friday.
   The river is expected to crest at 40 feet Sunday at Alexandria,
in central Louisiana's Rapides Parish. It was at 38.6 feet
Thursday. Flood stage is 32 feet.
   Emergency declarations: Gov. Buddy Roemer has requested federal
emergency declaration and agricultural disaster declaration.
   Outlook: There may be more rain that could make for more
backwater flooding in north and central parts of state. The
flooding is moving south. Even where fields aren't flooded,
officials say it will be weeks before farmers can work in them
again. Evacuees expected to begin returning to homes in north this

   One day after another youth was convicted of
murdering a black teen-ager in an unprovoked racial attack by a
white mob, the group's alleged ringleader was acquitted of murder.
   The verdict Friday in the case of Keith Mondello, no less than
that of Joseph Fama the day before, had been closely watched by
city residents fearful that a sense of injustice could provoke
racial violence.
   Supporters of the family of the black victim, 16-year-old Yusuf
Hawkins, took to the street Friday night, but there was little
violence. Five local television news employees received minor
injuries in attacks by demonstrators.
   Hawkins was shot to death Aug. 23 after he and three friends
were surrounded by a mob of about 30 whites in the mostly
Italian-American Bensonhurst area of Brooklyn.

   An air traffic controller says the government
improperly removed him from his job because he started taking an
anti-AIDS drug.
   Ron Wilkinson, who worked at Washington Dulles International
Airport, on Friday accused the Federal Aviation Administration of
discrimination.
   His union, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, has
filed a grievance contending that the presence of the human
immunodeficiency virus, HIV, which causes AIDS or use of the drug
AZT should not disqualify a controller.
   FAA spokesman Bob Buckhorn said the agency has a policy of
giving desk jobs to controllers who take AZT, out of concern that
side effects might compromise their critical task of following

<HEAD>Stock Analysts See Downside to Interest-Rate Drop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whenever Wall Street is ailing, few remedies
offer stronger curative powers than a simple dose of lower interest
rates.
   At least that would seem to be the message of what has happened
over the past few weeks, when the fortunes of both the stock and
bond markets took a dramatic turn for the better.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, after languishing
for months in what technical analysts call a ``trading range,'' has
abruptly jumped to record highs. The bond market likewise has come
to life after a slump through the winter and early spring.
   Inflation and recession fears have faded. Stock market seers are
setting their sights on targets like the 3,000 mark for the Dow.
   Amid all the enthusiasm, however, some analysts have begun to
question whether some caution isn't warranted as well.
   Even if interest rates were to keep falling the way they have
been since the beginning of May, these observers maintain, the news
might not be an unalloyed plus for the stock market.
   Prices of top-grade bonds are directly linked to interest-rate
expectations, as long as expectations don't change much about a
bond issuer's presumed ability to make interest and principal
payments when they come due.
   But the connection between interest rate fluctuations and stocks
is more tenuous, many analysts say.
   For one thing, the benefits of sluggish growth and low inflation
for stocks can be diminished by worries that a recovery in
corporate profits may be delayed.
   ``I still believe the world economy will slow and inflation will
ebb in the second half of this year and through the first half of
next year,'' writes Barton Biggs at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in a
current strategy bulletin.
   ``For a while, this represents better news for bonds than for
stocks, because the economic combination I anticipate will cause
many companies to report profits below consensus expectations.
   ``Lower interest rates justify higher price-earnings ratios, but
they don't validate higher prices unless the profits part of the
equation matches expectations.''
   In a similar appraisal, Wright Investors' Service of Bridgeport,
Conn., argues that ``evidence of a weak economy and moderate
inflation bode well for the bond market over the balance of the
year.
   ``Stock prices, on the other hand, are expected to move lower,
mainly because weak business conditions are likely to keep
corporate profits under pressure for the foreseeable future.''
   Such warnings didn't deter bullish stock traders in the past
week. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 18.33 points to
2,819.91, hitting record highs in three of the week's five trading
days.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.31 to 193.55;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gained
10.21 to 448.31, and the American Stock Exchange market value index
was up 3.82 at 356.32.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 175.65 million shares a day,
against 164.34 million the week before.
   In recent weeks, most analysts agree, stock and bond traders
alike have registered their delight over signs of waning
inflationary pressures. But many observers now are questioning how
long that unanimity of sentiment can continue.
   ``The issue now is just how much will inflation abate and, on
the stock market side, just how much will moderating inflation mean
to profits,'' says Greg Smith at Prudential-Bache Securities.
   ``I remain somewhat skeptical as to whether the inflation rate
can keep improving for a year or two accompanied by very good
profits.''

<HEAD>AT&amp;T Brawling With Big Banks Over Credit Cards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In this corner, a tag team of leading U.S.
banks. In that corner, challenger American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
Co., the nation's largest phone company. The purse for this match
is the plastic in your wallet.
   One of the biggest business brawls of 1990 shaped up this past
week when four major issuers of credit cards challenged AT&amp;T's new
card, which has attracted enormous consumer interest and could
realign the dominant players in the U.S. market of roughly 200
million cards.
   Citicorp, Chase Manhattan Corp, BankAmerica Corp and MNC
Financial Corp. asked regulators to examine whether AT&amp;T was
flouting banking and communication laws with the Universal Card, a
no-fee, low-interest Visa or Mastercard that doubles as a telephone
calling card. AT&amp;T started issuing them two months ago.
   The banks complained the phone giant offered card users
long-distance call discounts without the needed regulatory
approval, issued the cards through a tiny, inadequately financed
Georgia bank, and illegally controlled the bank. AT&amp;T called the
complaints groundless.
   ``We feel we did our homework and anticipated what the possible
questions would be,'' said AT&amp;T senior vice president Peter
Gallagher. ``We're in this business to stay.''
   Credit card industry analysts, awed by AT&amp;T's immense marketing
power, prior experience with government regulators and instant
customer base of 40 million long-distance callers, seemed inclined
to take AT&amp;T at its word. They said the banks have a real fight on
their hands.
   ``It's like trying to stop a thousand-pound gorilla,'' said
Spencer Nilson, publisher of the Nilson Report in Santa Monica,
Calif., which tracks the credit card business. ``I don't see any
way you can stop these people. If I were American Express or
Citibank, I would worry.''
   Citicorp's Citibank subsidiary, the largest U.S. issuer of Visa
and Mastercards with nearly 37 million, said it wasn't upset about
the competitive implications of AT&amp;T's entry into an industry known
for fierce rivalries. Citibank said it was concerned AT&amp;T was
getting into the game by cheating.
   Still, it's no secret that the banks have viewed AT&amp;T's entry
into their territory with growing anxiety. Soon after the phone
company started issuing the Universal Card, Citicorp gave $30
million in business to AT&amp;T competitor MCI Communications Corp.
   American Express, which has issued more than 24 million cards in
the United States alone, has raised no objections to AT&amp;T's card
and isn't worried about it, said Gary Tobin, vice president of
public affairs for the company's Travel Related Services division.
   He said the basic reason is that American Express cards are
charge cards, which must be paid in full each month and therefore
appeal to a different market than users of a Visa or Mastercard,
who pay interest on the outstanding balance of what they owe.
   ``AT&amp;T had a choice, issuing a credit card or charge card. They
went with a credit card,'' said Tobin. ``With Citibank and Chase
suing them, you can see who thinks AT&amp;T is their competitor.''
   AT&amp;T has declined to divulge how many people have signed up for
its new card, although the company has said inquiries have vastly
exceeded expectations. Industry analysts estimate AT&amp;T has issued
more than a quarter-million since the March 26 debut.
   Some said the banks' objections to the new card was a
smokescreen for their real concern, the ease with which AT&amp;T could
take away their business. A few banks that issue Visa and
Mastercards already have sought calling-card partnerships with the
MCI and Sprint long-distance phone companies, but are still worried
about the AT&amp;T card's impact.
   ``It's not so much that these banks can't be copycats. They can
be,'' said Elgie Holstein, executive director of the Bankcard
Holders of America, a consumer credit education group. ``It's that
AT&amp;T is building on an existing relationship with 40 million
people. It's that fundamental relationship that spooks these big
banks.''
   In other business and economic news this week:
   _The U.S. trade deficit swelled by more than $2 billion in March
to $8.45 billion, but economists were encouraged because of an
enormous growth in exports. Some predicted the trade deficit, the
difference between what the country sells and buys and the most
visible symbol of American economic weakness, would shrink
significantly this year.
   _A big convenience store chain swollen with debt headed for
refuge in bankruptcy court. The move by Circle K Corp. reflected
the growing financial squeeze on companies that expanded rapidly
with borrowed money in the 1980s.
   _Pan Am Corp. said it wants to sell the lucrative Northeast
shuttle, the most dramatic sign yet that one of the nation's oldest
and most troubled airlines urgently needs to raise cash. Pan Am's
announcement means both carriers that serve the most heavily
traveled air route in the country are for sale. Developer Donald
Trump put the shuttle he bought from Eastern Airlines a year ago up
for sale last month.

<HEAD>A Bored Economy Thinks of Taxes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fear of taxes is rising, and with plenty of
reason.
   The Tax Foundation states that each American's share of the
federal debt will increase by $827 in fiscal year 1991, and doesn't
everyone know that debts eventually have to be paid or somehow
worked off?
   Take your eye off taxes and they rise.
   Some folks still can't fathom how it was that the 1980s began
with a highly publicized tax cut but that the decade ended with
both Federal and state taxes having risen more than inflation.
   Locally, municipalities have been performing tricks too, holding
the line on basic real estate rates and assessments, but managing
to generate more revenue by adding separate fees for sewers and
water and trash collections.
   Now the fear quotient has taken a spurt with indications that
President Bush, the great defender against higher taxes, might be
willing to compromise on the issue in order to beat down the budget
deficit.
   The matter of taxes thus seems to be filling a void in a dull
economy, one that is neither strong nor weak, neither inflated nor
deflated. No economic boom is in sight, and no dangerous recession
either. Only boring sluggishness.
   ``Taxes appear to be the only `major problem' with any life in
it,'' said economist William C. Dunkelberg in releasing the latest
quarterly economic report of the National Federation of Independent
Business.
   Taxes, he said, were named as the No. 1 problem in the survey,
which included responses from 2,377 companies, all members of the
federation. It claims a total of more than 500,000 mostly small
companies.
   Second on the list of important problems was the first cousin of
taxes, regulation, which Dunkelberg describes as ``another form of
taxation that confiscates entrepreneurial resources to the
government's chosen issues.''
   The so-called alarmist issues that used to figure prominently in
the survey _ tight money, rising labor costs and deteriorating
labor quality _ ``all faded in April,'' he said.
   In all, small-business optimism, a statistical measure the
federation uses to determine the mood of smaller businesses, was
almost unchanged, suggesting a continuation of sluggish economic
activity for the next six months.
   If that sounds like an old story it is probably because you
heard it last year and in 1988 and in 1987. In all four years, the
early spring outlook for business conditions six months ahead was
about the same.
   Said Dunkelberg: ``If you want to have an economic boom you have
to experience a bust first.'' But neither bust nor boom is in sight.
   Instead, he said, ``What you can count on is a few more boring
chapters of modest economic entertainment before we can even begin
to hope for something more interesting.''
   Economically speaking, however, boredom can't long exist without
challenge, and increasingly the challenge appears to be shaping up
over taxes.
   The budget deficit points to taxes as a possible remedy.
Business has raised taxes to the status of a No. 1 problem.
President Bush, while still not moving his lips, has been perceived
to nod in that direction.

<HEAD>UAW Meets to Set Bargaining Agenda</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Auto Workers executives, who bragged about
winning job protection the last time they signed Big Three
contracts, may have some explaining to do when they meet fellow
unionists in Kansas City this week.
   Employment security is expected to be the top concern among UAW
delegates who have watched helplessly in recent years as U.S.
automakers have closed plants and idled thousands because of too
many cars and too few buyers, despite the reassuring language on
jobs in the current labor agreements.
   The nation's leading industrial union begins a convention Monday
to decide the most important issues at contract talks with General
Motors Corp., Chrysler Corp. and Ford Motor Co. starting this
summer.
   Besides the job security issue, rising health care costs are
also expected to dominate the convention agenda. Wages, while
certainly important to the rank and file, are lower on the priority
list.
   All three Big Three contracts, covering about 500,000 active and
laid-off workers, expire at midnight, Sept. 14.
   The differences among the three companies are great. But they're
all dogged by sluggish sales and aggressive competition from Japan,
which has increasingly muscled into the U.S. market by building
assembly plants here. About 28 percent of all cars sold in this
country are now Japanese.
   To UAW delegates, however, the issue of national origin of cars
is almost secondary. Many are questioning the usefulness of the job
protection provisions the union trumpeted years ago in the last Big
Three negotiations.
   The contract language said an automaker could not shut down an
assembly plant for any reason other than a slump in sales of the
product made at that plant.
   By the time those contracts expire, 17,000 workers will have
been idled by closings at GM assembly plants in Leeds, Mo.;
Pontiac, Mich.; Framingham, Mass.; and Atlanta and at Chrysler
factories in Kenosha, Wis.; Detroit, and St. Louis.
   Ford has not been under the same pressure as GM and Chrysler to
shrink, partly because it did not aggressively build new plants in
the 1980s. The last time it closed an assembly plant _ in San Jose,
Calif. _ was in 1983.
   ``In many respects, there is only one issue and that is how many
people will be working at General Motors over the long term,'' said
auto analyst Joseph Phillippi of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. of New
York.
   At the end of last year, there were about 429,200 GM hourly and
salaried employees North America, down 9 percent from two years
earlier. Ford's employment of 205,900 was down 2.3 percent, and
Chrysler's work force of 88,542 dropped 6.2 percent during the same
period.
   As the active employment rolls shrink, the number of retirees
grows. The UAW said it was unable to estimate how many retirees are
among the Big Three workers it represents. Chrysler has about one
retiree for every active employee. Active-to-retired employee
ratios at GM and Ford are slightly lower.
   Workers at Honda Motor Co.'s U.S. assembly plants average 33
years old compared with the average of 45 at Ford. Because there
are fewer retirees, the Japanese enjoy a competitive cost advantage
over GM, Ford and Chrysler, which have growing pension liabilities.
   The Japanese companies also can price their cars lower because
of lower labor expenses.
   A movement gaining strength in the UAW would add cost-of-living
protection for retirees. Union and management executives have said
that could be extremely expensive.
   The union has no obligation to bargain for retiree benefits, but
to ignore the issue could be political disaster for UAW leaders.
Union President Owen Bieber has said the union looks after its own.
   A hot debate in Kansas City on cost of living for retirees is
likely, but the issue appears doomed. During a conference of the
UAW's skilled trades council in Detroit last month, a proposal to
include the issue in bargaining agendas was defeated.
   Linked to retiree costs are health costs in general. Automakers
have said the expenses add hundreds of dollars to the price of each
car and truck made.
   The Big Three have been meeting during the past six months to
discuss common concerns about rising health-care costs and how to
approach the UAW about them. An internal Chrysler document
suggested any changes in job security provisions should be
accompanied by moves to cut health-care costs.
   It's the first time in 11 years that contracts expire at the
same time. In the past, the UAW has picked one automaker and
suspended negotiations with the others. When a pact was reached
with the ``target,'' it would be forced on the other two with
modifications.
   Chrysler negotiated separately with the UAW in the 1980s as it
recovered from near bankruptcy with the help of federal loan
guarantees.
   With negotiations drawing near, automakers are planning
production increases. At the same time, the union is telling
members to save money and avoid big debts. Both are hedges against
a potential strike.
   Those are normal precautions during contract negotiation years.
Phillippi thinks the posturing may be unnecessary.
   ``The embedded costs of this industry, the infrastructure, have
gotten so high because of robots and ongoing projects which cannot
stop because of competition with our friends from Japan,'' he said.
``This industry literally can't afford to take a strike longer than
a week or two to vent some steam.''

<HEAD>South African Violence Casts Doubt On Platinum Production Forecast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Signals from South Africa are confounding the platinum market,
which relies on the racially divided nation for more than
three-fourths of its supply.
   An annual report released last week by the British platinum
refiner Johnson Matthey PLC says South African mining companies
plan to increase platinum production by nearly 40 percent as of
1995.
   That forecast ordinarily would have given the platinum market a
reason to retreat. But in the case of racially divided South
Africa, precious metals strategists always look at how politics
could affect the market.
   So instead of reacting to the Johnson Matthey report, platinum
futures traders focused last week on incidents of racial violence
in South Africa and the related threat of mining shutdowns.
   Reports of at least 12 deaths due to racial violence helped
boost the price of platinum for July delivery on the New York
Mercantile Exchange to $507 a troy ounce at the close of trading
Friday compared with $483.90 a week earlier.
   What really shook the platinum market was news that one of the
biggest mining companies operating in South Africa, the
Anglo-American Corp., shut down part of a gold mine following a
clash that left two whites dead and several blacks injured.
   ``If the situation in South Africa were to reach dangerous
levels where they would have to close a few of those platinum
mines, you could see a strong rally develop,'' said Peter Cardillo,
commodity trading adviser with Josephthal &amp; Co. in New York.
   Johnson Matthey's new annual report on the platinum industry
makes little mention of racial strife in South Africa or the
possibility of mining disruptions.
   The London-based company said South African mines plan to raise
production by 1 million troy ounces during the next five years.
   This year alone, South Africa will produce as much as 150,000
ounces more than last year's record output of nearly 2.6 million
ounces, the company predicted.
   Johnson Matthey said worldwide platinum production last year
reached a new peak of about 3.4 million ounces, falling short of
demand by 90,000 ounces. That made 1989 the fifth straight year of
declining platinum stockpiles.
   Demand was down 5 percent in 1989 compared with 1988 but last
year still was the second-highest demand year on record, the report
said.
   Demand by the automobile industry, which uses platinum in
catalytic converters, rose 9 percent to 1.45 million ounces,
Johnson Matthey reported.
   The company said jewelry-related demand climbed to 1.3 million
ounces from 1.2 million in 1988, with almost all of that demand
coming from Japan.
   Investment demand for platinum bars and coins tumbled 75 percent
to 160,000 ounces last year from 660,000 ounces in 1988, mainly
because of high returns on other investments and a reduction in
inflation fears, Johnson Matthey said. Precious metals are
perceived as a good investment in inflationary times.
   Despite the forecast for increased production, the company said
it expects continued strong demand from the automotive and jewelry
sectors to keep the market in a delicate balance.
   ``As far as price is concerned, Johnson Matthey sees no reason
to deviate from the range forecast in their last interim review in
November of 1989, which predicted that prices would fluctuate
between $470 and $520 per ounce,'' the report said.
