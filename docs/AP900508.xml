   The Bush administration is pressing El
Salvador's President Alfredo Cristiani for progress on
investigating the murders of six Jesuit priests, the White House
said Tuesday.
   Presidential chief of staff John Sununu raised the matter with
Cristiani in a meeting Monday in San Jose, Costa Rica, where both
were attending the presidential inauguration of Rafael Calderon,
said White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   Nine Salvadoran military men have been accused of murdering the
priests on Nov. 16.
   Sununu ``emphasized that this is a serious matter for the U.S.
that must be properly addressed and he said that prosecution of
this case would have a significant impact in America,'' Fitzwater
told reporters.
   The spokesman said Cristiani had asked for the meeting.
   Fitzwater did not say that U.S. aid to El Salvador would be cut
if the Salvadoran government fails to pursue the case. But he did
say that Sununu underscored with Cristiani the growing reluctance
in Congress to approve additional aid while the case is stalled.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III recently told a
congressional committee that U.S. assistance will be affected by
how the case is handled.
   ``The administration and everyone in America is concerned about
the prosecution of the murders and that obviously would have an
impact on American attitudes,'' Fitzwater said when asked whether
the administration would back away from its request for $90 million
in military aid for El Salvador next year.
   He said Sununu and Cristiani ``talked about the overall problems
of the aid bill, the overall attitude in Congress and the status of
the investigation.''
   A Democratic congressional report this month said the
investigation of the case has come to a virtual standstill due to a
reluctance by the Salvadoran government to implicate its military.
   The State Department said Monday that the U.S. Embassy in San
Salvador is looking into reports that a log book and diary of one
defendant, Col. Guillermo Benavides, is missing.
   Benavides has been accused of ordering the slayings of the
Jesuits, who were accused by rightists of sympathizing with leftist
Salvadoran rebels.
   Columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak said in a column
appearing in Wednesday newspapers they had interviewed Benavides
for 2{ hours and he denied all knowledge of the massacre, saying,
``It was a complete surprise to me.''
   Three lieutenants accused in the case are among those who have
accused Benavides of ordering the killings. They reportedly have
said their orders came from Benavides, but there are now ``private
reports from the high command that the lieutenants are withdrawing
their accusations against him,'' the columnists wrote.
   Benevides was quoted as saying two of the lieutenants had been
under his command for only two days and he gave them no orders, and
all his orders to the third had to pass through the staff of the
military school he commanded.
   U.S. officials, trying to move the case along, had encouraged
the judge in the case to follow up such leads as the colonel's log
and diary, Boucher said.
   The administration has avoided directly criticizing Cristiani,
but the Sununu meeting is evidence of increasing U.S. pressure on
him to make sure the investigation gets back on track and is
successfully concluded.
   ``We take him at his word that he's trying to prosecute this to
the best of his ability,'' Fitzwater said, adding in reference to
the missing evidence, ``There are these complicating matters.''

<HEAD>Louvre Exhibition of High-Fashion Dolls Revives 1945 Chic</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A high-fashion show of French dolls wearing postwar
couture outfits has been brought back from the United States after
44 years in exile.
   Called Le Theatre de la Mode, the exhibition of 171 dolls in
spectacular Parisian settings will be presented Thursday at the
Musee des Arts de la Mode in a wing of the Louvre.
   Created by top couturiers and artists, the exhibition created a
sensation in 1945 in France, then in England and the United States
the following year.
   With clothes by designers such as Gres, Balenciaga and Balmain
and sets by the likes of Jean Cocteau, the exhibit showed the world
Paris remained a fashion leader despite its wartime hardships.
   Having been ``lost'' for decades, the dolls were traced to a
museum in Goldendale, Wash.
   They were brought back to be refurbished and displayed thanks to
a chance discovery and the perseverance of Susan Train, Paris-based
editor of Vogue magazine.
   ``It was like a miracle,'' said Train, who first heard in 1983
that the doll collection was at the Maryhill Museum.
   ``I'd heard about the beautiful dolls before, but nobody seemed
to know where they were,'' said Train.
   Then she was contacted by Stanley Garfinkel, a history professor
at Kent State University in Ohio, who stumbled across the
collection during research.
   Train consulted fashion industry leaders such as Pierre Berge,
president of Yves Saint Laurent, and Jacques Mouclier, head of the
Chambre Syndicale fashion guild.
   ``Everyone was excited by the discovery, and we decided to have
the show here if Maryhill agreed,'' said Train. Traveling to
Goldendale, she found many of the 27-inch-high dolls in good
condition.
   She won an agreement to let the dolls return to France _
temporarily.
   After closing in Paris on Sept. 9, the show will move in
December to the Costume Institute of New York's Metropolitan Museum
before the dolls return to Maryhill.
   In 1992, they are scheduled to be shown in Tokyo.
   ``I've been living and breathing the dolls,'' said Train, who
enlisted the few original creators still alive to help reconstitute
the 1945 show.
   She also persuaded writers like former Vogue editor Edmonde
Charles-Roux and historians Garfinkel and Herbert Lottman to write
chapters of an accompanying book.
   Of the postwar couturiers, only Mmes. Gres and Carven are
living. ``But we're lucky to have two of the original set-makers,
Andre Beaurepaire and Jean-Denis Malcles,'' said Train.
   Before the show opened, the museum's workrooms and galleries
bustled with artisans putting final touches on the dolls and
12-foot-high sets.
   ``It was like an archaeological puzzle to put heads, arms and
legs together,'' said Train.
   She pointed out a gown with a tulle drape and silk cord basque
waist.
   ``That was just a crumpled rag when we first saw it,'' she said.
``But Nadine Gasc (a curator of the fashion museum) figured out how
the original looked.''
   The costumes ranged from tweed suits to satin ball gowns.
   ``It's amazing how the dolls began to get their personalities
back when the experts started working on them,'' Train said.
   Every detail was perfect, from gloves to platform-soled shoes.
Every hair of the elaborate period coiffures was in place as styled
by Alexandre, today's most famous hairdresser.
   ``Imagine going 40 years without a coiffeur,'' said Train.
Miniature pins were used to curl the dolls' locks.
   Conceived by Robert Ricci, son of couturiere Nina Ricci, working
with Lucien Lelong, head of the Chambre Syndicale, the show was
intended to raise money for French war victims.
   It proved a brilliant success, and stands today as a document of
postwar fashion and art.
   Train said the exhibition ended up at Maryhill after being kept
in a San Francisco department store following a museum show there.
   ``Moving the whole thing back to France was apparently too
expensive, so with French approval, in 1952 it was sent to the
Maryhill.''
   The accompanying book, due to appear in English in December,
fills in background about the period and its fashions.
   Nadine Gasc's chapter points out the near-miracle of creating
such a collection at a time when Paris was exhausted by the
Occupation. Food was scarce, not to mention couture materials.
   ``The Nazis tried several times to transport French couture,
lock stock and barrel, to Germany,'' she said. ``But finally an
accord was reached whereby 60 houses could continue operating in
France during the war, with small allotments of fabric.''

<HEAD>FBI Warns Churches Nationwide About Possible Mail Bombs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI said Monday it was warning
churches nationwide to be on the alert for mail bombs.
   The warnings stemmed from concerns about similarities between
two bombs that exploded earlier this year in Virginia and Texas,
said Ron Wolfe, FBI spokesman here.
   The bombs that exploded in a Houston church in January and at
the Christian Broadcasting Network headquarters in Virginia last
month were wrapped similarly and were the same size, Wolfe said.
   ``We're not absolutely positive they're connected,'' he added.
   At a news conference April 29 in North Carolina, officials said
both exploding packages bore return addresses in Bladen County, N.C.
   Richard Metz, senior postal inspector for North Carolina and
South Carolina, declined to reveal the exact addresses but said
they were ``in the Fayetteville area.''
   The FBI is warning churches to watch for brown-paper wrapped
packages that measure about 6 inches long, 4 inches wide and 3
inches deep, and bear 15 25-cent stamps.
   Wolfe said the FBI telephoned 30 to 40 religious leaders in
Arkansas alone last week, ``every denomination we could think of.''

   Nora Dunn, a cast member of ``Saturday Night
Live,'' is refusing to perform on this weekend's show because she
considers host Andrew Dice Clay's comedy act degrading and
repulsive.
   ``I don't want to be associated with him and I oppose his
work,'' said Miss Dunn, who has been on the NBC comedy show since
the 1985-86 season.
   Clay's act, laced with expletives and frank descriptions of oral
sex and masturbation, is ``hateful,'' Miss Dunn said in a telephone
interview from New York on Monday. Others have called his routine
sexist and homophobic.
   Clay's management company in Los Angeles did not immediately
return a call seeking comment.
   Miss Dunn said she didn't know if other cast members would join
her boycott.
   Lorne Michaels, producer of the 15-year-old ``Saturday Night
Live,'' said, ``We're proud of Nora Dunn's statement and her stand
on this. But the show will go on.''
   Miss Dunn, 37, appeared in the films ``Working Girl'' and
``Miami Blues.'' Her characters on ``Saturday Night Live'' include
talk show hostesses Pat Stevens and Linda Dano, and Babette, the
international sex-kitten model.

   Pete Rose, awaiting sentencing on tax charges,
is no longer considered a publicity coup by some charities.
   Several charities have dropped plans to use the banished
ballplayer in publicizing their causes, his spokeswoman, Barbara
Pinzka, said Monday.
   ``Some charitable organizations decided that despite the
potential benefits of having Pete work with their organizations,
they were concerned about negative publicity,'' she said. ``There
have been three or four cancellations along those lines.''
   Banned from baseball last year for gambling, the former
Cincinnati Reds manager admitted cheating on his taxes by failing
to report $354,968 over four years. He could receive up to six
months and jail and $500,000 in fines.
   No sentencing date has been set.
   Rose is living at his winter home in Plant City, Fla., and has
several autograph appearances and charity golf tournaments
scheduled for the next two months, Pinzka said. He also is doing a
weekly radio sports show in Cincinnati.

   Sylvester Stallone, who subdued boxers and
guerrillas in his ``Rocky'' and ``Rambo'' roles, got the scare of
his life when he was mobbed by fans in Italy, his spokesman says.
   ``He appreciates the respect and love they give to him, but they
should be more careful,'' Paul Bloch said in a telephone interview
Monday from Milan. ``A lot of people could have been injured,''
   Bloch said the incident happened as Stallone was leaving a Milan
theater, where he had just received a TV network's award as ``the
world's most popular actor.''
   A crowd of 4,000 to 6,000 rushed Stallone's limo and pounded on
the windows and body and tried to climb on top to get to Stallone,
Bloch said.
   ``They were chanting, `Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!' They meant well,
but it was really, really scary,'' Bloch said.
   Stallone's limo finally escaped but was pursued by cars of
teen-age fans, forcing him to return to his hotel instead of
meeting friends for dinner.
   ``He said it was the scariest experience he's ever had before in
a crowd,'' the spokesman said.
   The actor's next stop is the Cannes film festival in France,
then he will head to Philadelphia for a final week of shooting on
``Rocky V,'' due for release in November, Bloch said.

   Rep. Tom McMillen, a former pro basketball
player, thinks Congress should get involved in regulating money in
college sports.
   ``I think our national legislature has the right to be involved
in looking at the imbalance between academics and athletics,'' the
Maryland Democrat told a National Press Club forum Monday.
   Colleges and even high schools are neglecting their duty to
provide athletes with a solid education, said McMillen, a former
Rhodes Scholar who played in the NBA.
   A bill he introduced last week would encourage high schools to
require students in extracurricular activities to maintain a ``C''
average, and reward schools with a 10 percent bonus in federal
money if they stick to the standard.
   But McMillen stressed that problems at high schools reflect
unbalanced college priorities, especially in money-making sports
such as football and basketball.

   Bruce Springsteen says he will match
the $10,000 raised at a benefit concert Sunday for an organization
that helps unemployed workers and their families.
   Springsteen has been supplementing state funding for the
non-profit Worker Resource Center over the last three years, said
group director Stanley Fischer.
   During the benefit, the rock star called Fischer from
California, where he is recording an album, and pledged to match
whatever amount was raised, Fischer said.

   The Grammy-winning hard rock group Living
Colour has sued Fox Broadcasting Co., claiming the network's new
``In Living Color'' show stole the band's name and logo.
   The lawsuit, filed Friday in New York, seeks an injunction
against Fox and producers of the Saturday night comedy as well as
unspecified damages.
   ``In Living Color'' producer Tamara Rawitt declined to comment,
as did Brad Turell, senior vice president of Fox.
   ``In Living Color'' has received rave reviews and was 29th in
the ratings during its April 15 debut.
   Created by Keenen Ivory Wayans, who did the black satirical
films ``Hollywood Shuffle'' and ``I'm Gonna Git You, Sucka,'' ``In
Living Color'' is a black version of ``Saturday Night Live'' that
pokes fun at racial stereotypes with an almost all-black crew of
comedians.

   Movie stars Dustin Hoffman, Kathleen Turner,
Maggie Smith and Tom Hulce won recognition for their work on stage
in the 1990 Tony nominations for the best of Broadway.
   Two lavish musicals, ``Grand Hotel'' and ``City of Angels,''
dominated the nominations announced Monday.
   ``Grand Hotel,'' a Tommy Tune musical set in 1920s Berlin, led
the field in the musical category with 12 nominations. ``City of
Angels,'' a 1940s Los Angeles detective musical, garnered 11.
   Both shows were nominated for best musical along with Andrew
Lloyd Webber's ``Aspects of Love'' and ``Meet Me in St. Louis,'' a
stage version of the MGM musical.
   The winners will be announced June 3 on CBS. They will be chosen
by 661 theatrical professionals and journalists who vote by secret
ballot.
   ``The Piano Lesson'' by August Wilson, the winner of this year's
Pulitzer Prize for drama, is the top contender for best play. It
will face ``Prelude to a Kiss,'' a comic fantasy by Craig Lucas,
``Lettice &amp; Lovage,'' by Peter Shaffer, and ``The Grapes of
Wrath,'' an adaptation by Frank Galati of John Steinbeck's novel.
   Smith was the favorite to win the best actress-play award for
her performance as an eccentric British tour guide in ``Lettice &amp;
Lovage.''
   Her competition will be newcomer Mary-Louise Parker of ``Prelude
to a Kiss,'' Geraldine James, who played Portia in a revival of
``The Merchant of Venice,'' and Turner, who is Maggie in a new
production of Tennessee Williams' ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.''
   ``I was hopin' that would happen,'' Turner said as she announced
the nominees at Sardi's, the restaurant of the theater crowd.
   Hoffman, snubbed by Tony nominators six years ago for his role
in a revival of ``Death of a Salesman,'' was nominated as best
actor for his portrayal of Shylock in ``The Merchant of Venice.''
   His competition in what could be a hotly contested category:
Charles S. Dutton, ``The Piano Lesson''; Hulce, the eager young
attorney in the courtroom drama ``A Few Good Men,'' and Robert
Morse, for his portrait of Truman Capote in ``Tru.''
   Tyne Daly, who plays Mama Rose in ``Gypsy,'' is the favorite to
win an award for best actress in a musical. Her competition
includes Georgia Brown, ``3 Penny Opera''; Beth Fowler, ``Sweeney
Todd,'' and Liliane Montevecchi, ``Grand Hotel.''
   Best actor-musical nominations went to David Carroll, Miss
Montevecchi's co-star in ``Grand Hotel''; Bob Gunton, who played
the title role in ``Sweeney Todd,'' and the stars of ``City of
Angels,'' James Naughton and Gregg Edelman.
   ``Gypsy'' and ``Sweeney Todd'' received best revival
nominations, as did ``The Merchant of Venice'' and ``The Circle,''
by W. Somerset Maugham.
   Michael Blakemore received two directing nominations, for
``Lettice &amp; Lovage'' and ``City of Angels.'' His competition in the
musical category are Tune, ``Grand Hotel''; Trevor Nunn, ``Aspects
of Love,'' and Susan H. Schulman, ``Sweeney Todd.''
   Blakemore goes against Galati, ``The Grapes of Wrath''; Peter
Hall, ``The Merchant of Venice,'' and Lloyd Richards, ``The Piano
Lesson,'' for best direction of a play.
   Tune also received a nomination for his choreography of ``Grand
Hotel.'' In a meager year for dance on Broadway, there were only
two other nominees, Joan Brickhill for ``Meet Me in St. Louis'' and
Graciela Daniele for ``Dangerous Games.''
   Terry Kinney and Gary Sinise, both from ``The Grapes of Wrath,''
received featured or supporting actor nominations. They will go
against Rocky Carroll in ``The Piano Lesson'' and Charles Durning,
who plays Big Daddy in ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.''
   Polly Holliday, who plays Big Mama in the production, was
nominated for best featured actress in a play. Also nominated were
S. Epatha Merkerson in ``The Piano Lesson,'' Lois Smith in ``The
Grapes of Wrath'' and Margaret Tyzack in ``Lettice &amp; Lovage.''

   NATO is at a critical phase as it struggles to
adapt to change in Europe and tries to make ``a partner in
security'' out of the Soviet Union, the alliance's secretary
general says.
   ``We are looking at this alliance not as an instrument of
confrontation, but as an element of cooperation in a new security
structure,'' Manfred Woerner said Monday.
   Speaking on the eve of the opening of a new round of NATO
meetings, Woerner also dismissed Soviet suggestions that a unified
Germany become neutral or hold dual membership in both the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact.
   ``Neutrality is no alternative. And to be a member of both pacts
is just neutrality without a word,'' the former West German defense
minister said.
   Woerner was in Washington for talks with U.S. officials before
flying today with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to Calgary, Canada,
to attend the spring session of NATO's Nuclear Planning Group.
   Woerner said the alliance is at a ``decisive ... phase of its
history'' as it attempts to adjust its military and political role
to the changes in Europe and its traditional foe, the Warsaw Pact.
   The alliance sees itself as fostering ``an element of
cooperation in a new security structure'' for Europe, he said, and
NATO will be ``one of the essential pillars, if not the essential
pillar, in such a structure.''
   This structure must involve the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact
member countries, he added.
   ``Clearly, we are looking towards the Soviet Union as a partner
in security, and we want them to look at our alliance not as an
antagonistic institution,'' the secretary general said.
   The NATO Nuclear Planning Group, composed of the defense
ministers from the alliance's 16 member nations with the exceptions
of Iceland and France, holds its formal sessions Wednesday and
Thursday.
   President Bush's announcement on Thursday that he was scrapping
plans to modernize short-range Lance nuclear missiles in Europe and
to upgrade nuclear artillery shells was expected to be the prime
topic at the session.
   Under intense pressure from the West Germans, NATO agreed last
year to postpone a decision on modernizing the aging Lance
missiles, which are expected to become obsolete in the mid-1990s.
   The updated weapons _ designed to fall on East German soil _
were deemed politically impossible to deploy, given the
developments in Eastern Europe and the prospects for German
unification.
   Woerner told reporters he expected the defense ministers to
issue a statement of support for Bush's initiative and to direct
the supreme allied commander in Europe, U.S. Gen. John Galvin, to
undertake a comprehensive study of the alliance's needs for nuclear
weaponry.
   The Calgary meeting is just the ``opening session'' of a series
of spring NATO meetings that will pave the way for the expected
summit of NATO leaders to be held in early July, Woerner said.
   He said the summit will ``most likely'' be held in London the
first half of July, but the dates are not yet set.
   Bush is scheduled to meet in Washington with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the end of May.
   At the summit session, the allies must decide when and how they
will address Bush's call for East-West talks on the future of
short-range nuclear weapons. The president's initiative left
unaddressed the future of those short-range weapons currently based
in Western Europe.
   Galvin's nuclear review also will include looking at the pact's
air-launched nuclear systems, Woerner said.
   Those systems are accepted by the public in West Germany as a
necessary part of belonging to the alliance, Woerner said, adding
that he didn't see an ``anguished debate'' within NATO about their
presence.
   Asked if he believed that NATO would begin to destroy its older
Lance missiles unilaterally before negotiations on short-range
weapons, Woerner said that wasn't likely given the Soviets' great
numerical advantage in such weaponry.

   The gala celebrating the 50th anniversary of
American Ballet Theater was such a success here in January that the
company decided to open its two-month season at the Metropolitan
Opera House by repeating it.
   There were a few differences Monday night; the evening was less
exciting but smoother running. As one ballet excerpt ended, the
next dancers entered. The audience could applaud but there was no
wasted time.
   This time, Alicia Alonso did not dance and Igor Youskevitch did
not make a speech. Two who danced Monday and did not in January
were Carla Fracci and Faruk Ruzimatov, formerly a Kirov Ballet
star, who has joined Ballet Theater.
   Mikhail Baryshnikov and Jerome Robbins, both praised during the
evening, did not attend either gala. Agnes de Mille gave a stirring
speech each time, though on Monday her body mike went on and off.
Company co-director Oliver Smith said 750 company members have
danced 385 ballets by 168 choreographers in the 50 years.
   Miss de Mille said, ``Lucia (Chase) said she wanted it to
include every kind of good ballet dancing and it did. People said
we had no style. That was our style.''
   She spoke after a lively excerpt from her ``Rodeo,'' with
Kathleen Moore as the Cowgirl and Victor Barbee as the Wrangler.
   Carla Fracci, an Italian ballerina much loved when she was a
guest artist with American Ballet Theater, danced the bride-to-be
in Antony Tudor's ``Lilac Garden.'' It was a poignant excerpt, with
Ricardo Bustamante as Her Lover, Michael Owen as The Man She Must
Marry and Martine Van Hamel as An Episode in His Past. Two other
Tudor excerpts were ``Pillar of Fire'' and ``The Leaves Are
Fading.''
   Ruzimatov provided excitement, danced a bravura solo from ``Le
Corsaire.'' Fernando Bujones also did bravura dancing, with Cheryl
Yeager in a ``Don Quixote'' excerpt and with Christine Dunham in a
Black Swan excerpt. Bjuones, an audience favorite when he was a
member of the company, has returned and was listed in the program
as a guest.
   Christine Dunham and Ross Stretton danced a White Swan duet.
Stretton will give his final performance May 22 and become
assistant to the company's directors. Johan Renvall also had a
flashy solo, the dance of the Bronze Idol from ``La Bayadere.''
Alessandra Ferri and Ricardo Bustamante did part of the hushed but
passionate balcony scene from Kenneth MacMillan's ``Romeo and
Juliet.''
   Dancer Kevin McKenzie made a speech saluting American Ballet
Theater's dancers through the years. At the end, a dozen company
alumni took bows with all the evening's dancers.

   Members of the city's bomb squad were somewhat
red-faced when they sent a robot to check out the contents of a
suspicious-looking suitcase in the heart of Montreal's red-light
district.
   The case was full of ladies' lingerie.
   The whole operation was carried out at mid-morning Monday before
hundreds of amused onlookers near the corner of Rue St-Laurent and
St. Catherines Street.
   The suitcase was left outside a cinema specializing in X-rated
films. An employee alerted police, who called the bomb squad.

   Executives of weight loss businesses say their
ads claiming that people can shed obesity for slimness simply show
the most encouraging examples of dieting.
   But a congressman who has been investigating diet companies
doesn't see it that way.
   ``It's high time some standards were put in place to do
something about the rampantly misleading advertising in the
field,'' Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said Monday.
   At a hearing of his House Small Business subcommittee, Wyden
chided the executives for promising extensive weight loss in short
time frames.
   ``I am concerned with the near-obsession in the industry with
fast, fast, fast when people should not go that route,'' Wyden
said, noting that rapid weight loss has been linked to health
problems.
   All the executives said no quick fix existed for obesity.
   ``The claim to lose weight quickly can be a very appealing
claim,'' said Peter Berger, president of Weight Watchers Inc. ``But
there are recognized speed limits of one to two pounds a week.''
   Berger defended a Weight Watchers' ad that says dieters can lose
three to five pounds the first week.
   ``Week one is an unusual week. Most people lose a lot of weight,
mostly a liquid loss,'' Berger said, indicating that advertising is
supposed to encourage.
   ``We believe in slow and steady, but too slow can be
discouraging,'' he said.
   Others who spoke included representatives of Jenny Craig
International, the Diet Center, Physicians Weight Loss Centers,
Nutri-System, Optifast and Medifast.
   The session was one of a series that Wyden's subcommittee has
held on diet programs, which each year generate about $33 billion
in revenue but are governed by few federal regulations.
   Wyden pulled out a Diet Center advertisement that said: ``You
can lose 10 pounds in two weeks, be two sizes trimmer in three
weeks.''
   ``That relates to the earlier weight loss people experience in
the first weeks,'' said Jim Liljenquist, Diet Center senior vice
president for corporate communications. ``But this ad has been
discontinued.''
   Ellen Destray, vice president of Jenny Craig International, said
she expected reforms in diet company advertising as a result of
Wyden's hearings.
   Slow weight loss, employing nutritional eating habits with
simple exercise was advocated by most of the group as the
healthiest approach.
   Advocates of the faster results of liquid diets said their
patients are supervised by doctors.
   Some of the weight loss professionals agreed that federal
regulations should be developed; others said the industry could
police itself.

   Selma's first black schools superintendent
resigned Monday and said he would drop his $10 million racial
discrimination suit against the city and the school board in return
for a cash settlement.
   In announcing his resignation, Norward Roussell cited the stress
of the turmoil surrounding his case since the school board voted
late last year to dismiss him.
   Roussell did not disclose the amount of the settlement, but said
it was ``close to'' what he would have received if his three-year,
$69,500-a-year contract had been renewed, about $208,500. He said
the settlement agreement would be effective ``when I get the
money.''
   The December vote by the white-controlled school board not to
renew Roussell's contract, expiring June 30, sparked
near-continuous protests by blacks, some of whom were arrested
during demonstrations.
   Roussell sued the city and the school board, claiming racial
discrimination was behind the board's vote. The board said it voted
to dismiss him because of his management style.
   In his resignation statement, Roussell said he decided to ``exit
early'' so he and his family could go on with their lives ``without
continually having to deal with the stress related to the current
situation in Selma.''
   ``People are protesting because they want quality education for
their children,'' Roussell said in a telephone interview from his
home Monday night. ``This protest has never been about me. It is
not something I asked people to do.''
   Roussell said he had plans for his future but he declined to
discuss them.

   The mother of a Peace Corps volunteer held
captive in Africa said she received word Monday that he is ``safe''
but still being held by Liberian rebels.
   Jane Kelley said she was telephoned by a Peace Corps official
and told that a reporter in Africa was in touch with the rebels.
   ``We were told he was safe, but nothing further,'' said Mrs.
Kelley.
   Her son, David Kelley, 24, and three relief workers were
kidnapped a week ago as they inspected refugee centers along the
Liberian-Guinean border.
   One of the relief workers was freed on Friday and told Guinean
authorities that the rebels were holding the others for
interrogation.
   The Peace Corps had hoped for Kelley's release over the weekend,
``But we have to play the waiting game a little longer,'' Mrs.
Kelley said.
   The rebels have previously captured other Westerners and held
them for several days before releasing them.
   Fighting between the rebels and Liberian government troops broke
out Dec. 24, and humanitarian groups estimate hundreds of rebels
and scores of soldiers have been killed.
   The State Department said Wednesday that 380 American officials
and their dependents had left Liberia as rebel forces moved within
striking distance of the capital, Monrovia.

<HEAD>GAO: Army Overpays Contractors Millions of Dollars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six Army inventory centers lost control of
more than $328 million in payments to contractors, and in some
cases overpayments and errors in accounting went uncorrected for a
year or more, congressional investigators say.
   The General Accounting Office, in a study released Monday, said
a review of selected payments showed the Army did not take prompt
action to collect millions of dollars in overpayments made to
contractors and did not correct thousands of bookkeeping errors.
   It said one year-old $2.8 million overpayment wasn't collected
until it was brought to the attention of Defense Department
personnel by the GAO, an investigative arm of Congress.
   In another instance, the GAO found that more than a year elapsed
before the Army detected a $307,000 duplicate payment to a
contractor, the study said.
   The report noted that the lack of accuracy tied up ``Army funds
which could be used to meet other Army requirements. If not
collected promptly, these overpayments can be considered
interest-free loans to contractors and may be lost in case of
contractor bankruptcy.''
   Although Army regulations require that immediate corrective
action be taken to resolve such problems, ``We found that in many
cases the subordinate commands do not initiate followup actions for
a year or more to resolve outstanding negative balances,'' the
study said.
   The GAO study involved a review of the Army Materiel Command's
control procedures over what is formally known as ``negative
unliquidated obligations,'' or ULOs, related to the purchases of
supplies and equipment. These result when the recorded expenditure
exceeds the amount obligated, the GAO said.
   The Army Materiel Command has six subordinate commands
nationwide, through which it purchases, stocks and distributes
billions of dollars worth of supplies. It performs this task for
Army units, other military services and foreign governments.
   As of last Sept. 30, records showed about 4,500 negative ULO
balances totaling $328 million, the study said.
   ``Our analysis of the negative ULO balances totaling about $49
million show that 47 of the balances valued at over $23 million
were more than six months old,'' the study said. ``Coordination
problems between the commands and other Department of Defense
organizations caused these delays in resolving the negative
balances.''
   Because regulations don't require the disclosure of such
problems, ``Army headquarters personnel did not know the
magnitude'' of the negative balances, the report said.
   Most of the negative ULOs occurred ``because ... a contractor
was paid too much ... or information on an obligation, payment or
collection transaction was inaccurately or incompletely
processed,'' the study said.
   ``Of the $49 million in negative ULOs we reviewed in detail,
$7.6 million was caused by overpayments, $23.8 million was due to
processing errors, and $2.7 million was related to other causes,''
the study said. ``In addition, the causes for $18 million could not
be determined.''
   Also, the study said, the government employees responsible for
making the overpayments to contractors are personally liable for
any overpayments that are not covered unless the comptroller
general, who heads the GAO, ``relieves them of that liability,''
the report said.
   In its comment on the report, Defense Department officials
agreed that the report's findings were serious and that they
reflect ``a systematic DOD problem.''
   The department agreed to take remedial action along the lines
recommended in the report.

<HEAD>Third World Prices Rose Record 86.3 Percent in 1989</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer prices rose a record 86.3 percent in
Third World countries last year, spurred by a 350 percent rise in
Latin America, the International Monetary Fund reports.
   The United States, the world's largest economy, was a little
above the average of industrial countries at 4.8 percent.
   Among 22 industrial countries the rise was only 4.5 percent, up
from 3.4 percent in 1988, the IMF said Monday. The increases ranged
from 1.1 percent in the Netherlands to 20.8 percent in Iceland.
Japan had 2.3 percent and West Germany 2.8 percent.
   The IMF gets figures from its member countries but calculates
them on its own basis to make them comparable, so rates for
individual nations sometimes differ from those published by
governments themselves.
   Latin American average prices were heavily increased by runaway
inflation in two of the area's most important countries: Argentina
at 3,079 percent and Brazil at 1,287 percent. That meant Argentine
consumers were paying roughly 30 times as much for the same basket
of goods at the end of 1989 as at the beginning of the year.
   Peru had an even higher rate: 3,398 percent.
   Mexico, which adopted a strict austerity program, dropped to 20
percent from 114 percent in 1988.
   The fund classifies 130 of its members as ``developing
countries,'' including those in Eastern Europe. The Soviet Union
does not belong and the fund gives no figures for it.
   For its seven European members outside the industrial group, the
inflation rate rose in 1989 to an average 232 percent, largely
because of Yugoslavia's 1,239 percent and Poland's 244 percent. An
IMF official said Poland's inflation has dropped sharply this year
because of the new non-Marxist government's shock program to shift
away from communism toward a market system.
   Annual figures for Africa and the Middle East were incomplete.
Many Middle East countries have not been reporting in recent years.
Among those that have, Israel's inflation rate rose to 20.2 percent
last year from 16.3 percent in 1988 and Egypt's climbed to 21.3
percent from 17.7 percent a year earlier.
   Africa's average appeared steady: 18.9 percent in 1988 and 21.2
percent in the third quarter of 1989. That average masked a wide
range, from Zambia's 186 percent inflation in October to small
price reductions in several countries including Chad, Togo and the
Central African Republic.
   Only Asia's average showed a decline in the inflation rate. For
21 countries there the annual increase dropped to 10.2 percent last
year from 11.8 percent in 1988. China's rate declined to 16.3
percent from 20.7 percent and India fell from 9.4 percent in 1988
to an annual rate of 6.2 percent in the third quarter of 1989.

<HEAD>Japanese Breaking Cultural Barriers in Iowa Town</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROGER MUNNS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LE MARS, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Students, townspeople and some board
members were wary when 198 Japanese freshmen enrolled at tiny
Westmar College under a merger with a Tokyo university. But the
cultural barriers are coming down fast.
   Cash-strapped Westmar announced the agreement with Teikyo
University in March. In return, Westmar got about $4 million to
refurbish dormitories and buildings, raise salaries, add faculty
and enroll up to 400 Japanese.
   ``It sounded like a lot of propaganda by the board of
trustees,'' said senior Tom Joaquin of Denver. ``They said the
Japanese would broaden our campus. Right. We've had foreign
students before, and they mostly stay in their rooms.''
   But after the Japanese arrival in April increased enrollment by
more than a third to 566 students, Joaquin's impressed.
   ``It's like a real school now,'' he said.
   ``They're just like Americans, young and wild,'' said Cuong Van
Lo, a student from Rock Valley.
   The Japanese can read and write English but most do not speak
well. The new students are courteous and cheerful, say American
students and townspeople, but conversations are lurching affairs
that usually break down into gestures.
   Businesses in this town of 8,200 also said there is a language
barrier, but Japanese students have learned that money talks.
   ``We didn't anticipate that they'd have much money when they
arrived,'' said Dean Carroll, manager of the Pamida discount
department store. ``But they had bucks burning holes in their
wallets.''
   Carroll said there isn't a mountain bike to be found in town
after Japanese students bought every one in stock.
   ``I know we sold between 10 and 15 within four hours. That's
quite a few. They're the more expensive bikes, anywhere from $120
to $160,'' he said. ``And I know Coast to Coast Hardware is out of
all 10-speed bikes, too.''
   ``To be honest, I didn't think it would have the impact it has.
It's like the back-to-school rush. Like in boom boxes. They don't
want the cheaper ones, they want the ones with compact disks that
run for $169. They don't worry about price,'' Carroll said.
   He also said the new students created a run on toiletries,
stationery, audio cassettes and disks, even bottled water.
   Student Hiroshi Hayakawa said Americans are more friendly than
Japanese and aren't in such a rush.
   ``Many people say hi,'' he said. ``In Japan, people don't say
hi. They just pass.''
   ``To be friends with Americans is a little difficult'' because
of language barriers, he said. ``So we play sports, join them with
eating. We make friends that way.''
   He also said he didn't miss the food from home. ``I like pizza,
spaghetti, hamburger.''
   Westmar is one of four U.S. schools to affiliate recently with
Teikyo, whose president plans on spending $70 million to develop
academic homes for Japanse students overseas. In 1988-89, there
were about 24,000 Japanese students enrolled in the United States.
   Westmar jumped at Teikyo's offer of cash and students. But the
chairman of the board resigned over the quick decision. Other board
members also complained, and the United Methodist Church said it
would review the $90,000 it gives the school each year.
   ``Westmar has always lived on the financial edge, as many
private colleges do,'' said Valda Embree, vice president of
institutional advancement. ``What was so interesting about Teikyo
was the offer of students to go along with their gift.''
   Students said they have heard the newcomers will be tough
competitors. One college staffer, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said, ``I feel sorry for the Americans. The Japanese
will eat them alive in the classroom.''
   Marsha Melnichak, school spokeswoman, said classes will be
taught in English. She quoted one professor as saying, ``Remember,
these students are studying in another language. If they can still
beat you, then you should be worried.''
   By agreement with Teikyo, the Japanese students will never
outnumber the Americans. Another 200 Japanese will arrive next
spring.

   The United States will bar the importation of
looted Peruvian archaeological treasures to shield them from the
greed of U.S. art dealers and collectors, the Bush administration
says.
   ``The import ban is the strongest action possible to assist Peru
in preserving its cultural heritage,'' Bruce S. Gelb, director of
the U.S. Information Agency, said at a news conference Monday.
   The ban targets artifacts of the Moche culture being stolen by
armed looters in Peru's Sipan region, the locale of intact
pre-Colombian tombs.
   Gelb said the archaeological sites are ``believed to be the
richest tombs found in the Western Hemisphere.''
   He said an inquiry showed that the U.S. market for art objects
looted from the tombs of the Moche culture in northern Peru ``is so
large it is encouraging looting in the region.''
   Cesar Atala, the Peruvian ambassador to the United States, said
the ban ``will help us avoid the enormous lure of the U.S. market.''
   Intricately crafted gold, gilded copper and silver objects have
been uncovered at the site.
   Michael H. Lane, deputy commissioner of U.S. Customs, compared
the looting to narcotics trafficking.
   ``We see the same techniques and the same motive _ greed _ as we
see every day in the smuggling of narcotics,'' Lane said.
   Under the presidential order, requested by Peru, artifacts from
the region will be seized by Customs agents and returned to Peru
unless the items are accompanied by an export permit issued by the
Peruvian government.
   Atala said the looting was preventing archaeologists from
evaluating the material in its original location and from studying
the Moche culture, its origins and its relationship to other
pre-Colombian cultures.
   Experts say the tombs, discovered in 1987, have yielded
important information about the civilization that inhabited the
river valleys of northern Peru from 100 to 700 A.D.
   Lane said the ban would not be retroactive, but Moche objects
already in the United States could be seized under other laws if
they were shown to have been stolen.
   The United States imposed emergency restrictions on monumental
pre-Colombian artifacts from El Salvador in 1987 and on some Andean
textiles from Bolivia last year. Similar requests from Canada and
Guatemala are pending.

   Andrew Jackson's parrot shook up
presidential functions with a foul mouth, Warren Harding's pooch
had his own chair in the Cabinet room and the current first dog
eats out of a china dog dish.
   A new exhibit at the Gerald R. Ford Museum on presidents and
their pets provides a rare glimpse into the private lives of first
families.
   ``This is a way for people to see the more personal, human side
of our presidents,'' museum curator James Kratsas said Monday.
``Pets are something almost everyone can relate to.''
   Personal attachments with animals date back to George
Washington, said exhibit specialist Jane Isaacs. The first
president established a deer park at Mount Vernon and got rid of
his foxhounds because they chased and frightened the graceful
animals.
   Exotic birds seemed to be the popular presidential choice in the
19th century. Both Dolly Madison and Thomas Jefferson had
mockingbirds.
   Jackson gave his wife, Rachel, an Amazon parrot, who learned to
speak in English and Spanish.
   ``She was quite profane _ probably in both languages,'' Isaacs
said of the bird, named Poll. ``She behaved so badly at Jackson's
funeral (in 1845), she had to be removed.''
   Theodore Roosevelt's family's liked exotic animals. The
presidential menagerie included a badger, bear cubs, guinea pigs,
ponies and dogs. The president's daughter, Alice, attended
presidential functions with a green snake named Emily Spinach
tucked inside her purse.
   Harding's attachment to his Airedale, Laddie Boy, gave man's
best friend a special status in the White House, Isaacs said.
   ``Laddie Boy actually had his own chair in the Cabinet room,''
Isaacs said.
   Also on display are current first dog Millie's china food bowl
from Air Force One and the 25-square-foot doghouse _ a replica of
the White House _ that Ronald Reagan's pooch, Rex, slept in.
   One of the best known stories involving presidential pets
occurred when Lyndon Johnson picked up his pair of beagles by the
ears.
   ``I call it the yelp heard 'round the country,'' said Isaacs,
who added that Johnson was really very devoted to his pets.
   Johnson later became inseparable with a mutt that his daughter,
Luci, found at a Texas gas station. ``Yuki slept with them and
attended formal ceremonies,'' Isaacs said.
   Another great animal lover was Calvin Coolidge, who allowed his
white collie to attend news conferences, entertain heads of state
and sleep in his bedroom.
   One of the few presidents to like cats, Coolidge once took to
the radio to ask for help in finding his cat, Tiger, who had run
off. ``As you might imagine, everybody and his brother turned up
with a gift cat,'' Isaacs said.
   Ford's close companion, golden retriever Liberty, proved her
worthiness in helping manage the president's time, Isaacs said.
   ``When a guest was in the Oval Office and had overstayed his
welcome, he would give a signal and Liberty would come over and
start wagging her tail. It provided a natural pause in the
conversation and the president could move onto his next
appointment,'' Isaacs said.
   The exhibit runs through Nov. 4.

<HEAD>Eastern Europe Seen as Market for High-Protein Meal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Agriculture Department analysis says
Eastern Europe's market-oriented drive toward greater livestock
output could help boost U.S. exports of high-protein meal.
   But the department's Economic Research Service also cautioned
that there are some big question marks.
   ``Eastern Europe is a protein-deficit region, yet has a
developed livestock sector that serves and established export
market and supports high per capita meat consumption,'' the agency
reported Monday.
   Led by Poland, East Germany and Romania, the region is among the
top five users of oilseed meal, which includes meal from
cottonseed, rapeseed, sunflowerseed and other sources.
   The largest are the United States, the European Economic
Community, the Soviet Union and China.
   ``Behind exporter optimism are expectations that widespread
popular demands for improved living standards, so evident in
Romania last December, will force officials to increase protein
imports,'' the report said.
   Thus, oilseed imports ``could rise modestly'' over the decade by
about 3 percent annually from the 1 percent rate of the late 1980s.
But the report added that ``it's uncertain whether political and
economic reforms can stimulate significantly higher'' growth than
that.
   ``With or without economic reform, the region still must service
its sizable foreign debt,'' the report said. ``Debt service
requirements will constrain overall import growth, as they have
throughout the 1980s.''
   Looking at Poland, the biggest user of oilseed meal in Eastern
Europe, the report said the country's comparative advantage lies in
expanded production of pork and other livestock products.
   ``An increase in pork output depends on a significant
improvement in feed rations,'' the report said. ``Currently,
Poland's hog sector lags in every production indicator: sows
produce smaller litters than in the industrialized West; piglets
take longer to wean; sows produce fewer litters per year; hogs tend
to be slaughtered at nine months instead of six months, and the fat
content is higher.''
   The report, by USDA economists Robert Cummings and Nancy
Cochrane, said Poland's shortcomings in swine production are
largely a result of inadequate animal nutrition.
   ``Part of the protein need could be satisfied with Poland's
large rapeseed crop, but only if the Poes are able to expand
crushing capacity and expand cultivation (of desirable varieties).
Even so, there will be a significant need for soybean meal.''
   But even if the optimistic estimates about Eastern European meal
needs are correct, substantially larger sales of U.S. soybean
producers are not certain.
   ``Preference for soybean meal imports, South American
competition, the fate of currency convertibility, and the
availability of export credit guarantees will determine the level
of U.S. sales,'' the report said.

   Former Agriculture Secretary John R. Block,
who is now a food industry executive, says the recent Earth Day
celebration was flawed.
   ``The amount of national attention the whole event received was
unbelievable'' he said. ``It is very fashionable to be an
environmentalist. I guess we all want to be one.''
   But Block said there was ``something wrong'' with the Earth Day
celebration last month.
   ``It was more like a wake, with the environmental fringe filling
the air with their own pollution of gloom,'' Block said a statement.
   For example, he said, there were allegations that ``farmers are
poisoning the land by using dangerous chemicals'' to produce food
and that the world's population stands on the brink of global
famine.
   Block, who is president of the National-American Wholesale
Grocers' Association, was secretary of agriculture during most of
the Reagan administration.
   The 20th anniversary of Earth Day was April 22, climaxing a week
of activities to call attention to global environmental problems
and urge their solution.
   ``A celebration should have included a tribute to the American
farmer, the American food industry and American technology which
has been able to keep the wolf away from the door all these
years,'' Block said. ``Food in this country takes less than 13
percent of disposable family income. No other country in the world
can claim the same.''
   One of the things that riled Block was the praise of West
Germany ``over and over again for being the ideal environmental
nation.''
   ``Germany may be doing rather well in recycling bottles and
papers,'' he said. ``But they use five times as much fertilizer per
acre as we do and twice as much in (other) chemicals.''
   Further, he said, ``the free enterprise, market-driven economy
of the United States has left the communist, central-planned
economies in Europe choking in their own filthy air.''

   The Agriculture Department says private
exporting companies have sold the Soviet Union an additional 1.75
million metric tons of U.S. corn for delivery this year under a
long-term supply agreement.
   Officials said Monday 1.15 million tons were new sales while
600,000 tons were previously reported but were shifted from
``unknown'' destinations to the Soviet Union.
   Large sales are reported daily to USDA by exporters, who
frequently list foreign destinations as unknown until final
arrangements are made.
   Orders since Oct. 1, the beginning of the agreement's new year,
now total more than 15.6 million tons of corn, 3.3 million tons of
wheat, 342,300 tons of soybeans and 1.2 million tons of soybean
meal. In addition, sales of barley total 7,300 tons.
   In 1988-89, sales were a record of more than 21.7 million tons,
including more than 16.3 million tons of corn and nearly 5.4
million tons of wheat.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 1.75 million tons
of corn would be about 69 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.66 per bushel at the
farm level, according to USDA's five-day average. Thus, the latest
sale could have a farm value of about $184 million.

<HEAD>Fundamentalist Guerrilla Warns Against Superpower Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY GANNON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fundamentalist Moslem guerrilla
leader threatened to fight against any superpower deal to end the
12-year-old struggle to oust Afghanistan's pro-Moscow government.
   Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, firebrand leader of Hezb-i-Islami or Party
of Islam, has vowed to launch a jihad or ``holy war'' if a dealis
worked out at this month's U.S.-Soviet summit in Washington.
   The Afghan war is expected to figure prominently in talks
beginning May 30 between President Bush and Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``The superpowers have agreed to prevent the formation of an
Islamic government in Afghanistan,'' said Abdul Qadir Karyab, who
heads Hekmatyar's politicial committee.
   ``We will not only continue our jihad on the battlefield, but we
also have other ways should the superpowers interfere in our
internal affairs,'' Karyab told The Associated Press.
   Western diplomats and Afghan experts in Islamabad have hinted
the superpowers are close to a deal, but decline to give any
specific details.
   The likeliest scenario, they said, was have elections in
Afghanistan run jointly by the United Nations and the Organization
of the Islamic Conference or by a neutral group chosen by the two
organizations.
   But they also warned it will be very difficult to find a
political solution acceptable to both the rebels and the Afghan
government.
   Afghan President Najibullah has refused to step down prior to
elections, a pre-condition set by even the most moderate guerrilla
groups headquartered in Pakistan's rugged frontier city of Peshawar.
   The guerrillas have come under increasing pressure, particularly
from the United States, to end their internal rivalries and devise
a political settlement to the war.
   But the seven guerrilla groups are deeply divided. The president
of the guerrilla's self-proclaimed government-in-exile,
Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, has branded Hekmatyar a ``murderer'' and
accused him of killing more innocent Afghans than Soviet or Afghan
soldiers.
   Karyab said the Hezb-i-Islami would consider imposing its will
on the other guerrilla groups.
   ``If they can't agree with our reasonable proposals, we have our
unreasonable ways,'' he said refusing to elaborate.
   Hekmatyar is also feuding with Burhanuddin Rabbani, leader of
the powerful Jamiat-i-Islami or Society of Islam. The two have
traded threats and accusations of murder, kidnapping and theft.
   Hekmatyar, who is strongly anti-Western, fought ferociously
against the Soviets and received the lion's share of U.S. military
assistance during the 12-year-old war.
   Karyab said Washington now fears Hekmatyar's strength in
Afghanistan.
   ``As far as I can see, the United States has very dangerous
plans, including certain activity, even terrorist acts against the
Hezb-i-Islami leader,'' Karyab said.
   The United States sends $500 million a year in aid to the
guerrillas while the Soviet Union gives an estimated $5 billion a
year to the Kabul government.

<HEAD>Woman Charged With Adultery Agrees to Parental Counseling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ASHLAND, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman charged with adultery after
admitting at a divorce hearing that she had an affair has agreed to
community service and counseling rather than face a trial.
   Donna E. Carroll, 28, was charged under the state's
seldom-enforced adultery law in July.
   Under an agreement signed Monday, she must perform 40 hours of
community service and attend two months of parental counseling
sessions for the charge to be dismissed.
   Defense attorney Jay S. Moynihan said she entered into the
agreement, which does not represent an admission of guilt, to avoid
a trial.
   Mrs. Carroll, a homemaker, has been free on a $1,000 bond and
has moved to Janesville with her 7-year-old son. Their phone number
is unlisted.
   District Attorney Robert E. Eaton has refused to discuss the
case.
   Mrs. Carroll was charged after admitting under oath at a divorce
proceeding that she had an affair in February 1989 with a truck
driver her husband befriended.
   Mrs. Caroll's now former husband, Robert, also admitted he had
had an affair. But prosecutors did not press adultery charges
against him, saying there was insufficient evidence to prove any
violation occurred in Wisconsin.
   A court-appointed guardian for the couple's son said last fall
that Carroll wanted to disqualify his wife for custody, which she
later won.
   Eaton has said the custody dispute played no part in his
decision to prosecute Mrs. Carroll.
   The statute, seldom enforced this century, prohibits a married
person from having sex with any person other than his or her
spouse. It carries up to two years in prison and $10,000 in fines.
   About two dozen other states, including Illinois, have criminal
laws against adultery, but enforcement has virtually been
non-existent in recent years. The penalties are as minor as a $10
fine in Maryland.
   In court papers, Eaton argued the adultery law is still valid
and is based on the ``interest of the state in the preservation of
the marriage.''
   But Moynihan and the American Civil Liberties Union argued the
law is unconstitutional. They said it denies Mrs. Carroll's rights
to privacy and equal protection of the law and amounts to cruel and
unusual punishment.
   Eunice Edgar, executive director of the Wisconsin ACLU, said the
organization will push for repeal of the statute.
   The case ``indicates that couples who are in the throes of
divorce and custody battles will often use whatever they can in the
state law to inflict more harm and pain to each other,'' Ms. Edgar
said.

   Bessie Butler says if elected sheriff she'll
move into the jail and cook for the prisoners.
   Just don't expect her to mother the inmates.
   ``I can hold down a horse, and I have rassled with my sons, and
I can take care of myself,'' said the 63-year-old former horse
wrangler, camp cook and sawmill worker. ``I am not scared of no
man, and I never have been.''
   Her husband, 84-year-old Tex Butler, who ran unsuccessfully for
sheriff in 1982, added, ``She's a crack shot, too. She can outwork
and outshoot any man.''
   If elected, Butler would be the first female law officer in
recent memory in largely uninhabited, mountainous Granite County,
which has 1,400 registered voters. She is entered in the June 5
primary for the Democratic nomination.
   Butler said she and her husband will move into the now-vacant
sheriff's quarters in the jail and be on call 24 hours a day.
   Instead of buying meals from the Granite County Hospital food
service in Philipsburg, she'll do the cooking herself to save the
taxpayers money, she said.

<HEAD>New President Has Arias' Shoes to Fill</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inauguration set to begin at 2 p.m. EDT</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 41-year-old lawyer from a
prominent political family takes over as president today in the
long shadow of Oscar Arias, who thrust this country into the global
spotlight with his regional peace efforts.
   Incoming President Rafael Angel Calderon acknowledges his
predecessor's international renown but says he will concentrate on
internal affairs _ without giving short shrift to foreign policy.
   Arias spearheaded Central American peace efforts that promoted
democracy and sought an end to civil wars. He won the 1987 Nobel
Peace Prize for drafting a regional peace plan.
   Though originally thrilled with Arias' fame, many Costa Ricans
have now come to feel that he gained it at their expense _ by
ignoring domestic problems. Even so, he leaves office with an
approval rating of 90 percent, according to national polls.
   Calderon's Party of Social Christian Unity is slightly to the
right of Arias' social-democratic National Liberation Party.
However, the two men seem to basically think alike, and Calderon is
expected to steer Costa Rica on the same course that has made it a
democratic bulwark in Latin America.
   Years of neutrality and stability have given Costa Ricans one of
the higher living standards and literacy rates in the hemisphere.
The United States has long pointed to Costa Rica as an example of
what countries can accomplish under democratic governments.
   First Lady Barbara Bush headed the U.S. delegation attending
today's inauguration, which was being held in the national soccer
stadium before 50,000 spectators.
   Calderon says his administration will eliminate what the Social
Christians call the ineffeciency and bureaucracy of a swollen
public sector that eats heavily into the national budget.
   But the new president, whose father was a president and social
reformer, also advocates a broad profit-sharing program for
private-sector employees.
   Calderon had twice lost bids for the presidency, in 1982 and
1986, before narrowly defeating National Liberation candidate
Carlos Manuel Castillo in February. Arias, who was elected in 1986,
was barred by the constitution from running for re-election.
   The quest for the presidency by Calderon, affectionately known
as ``Junior,'' was made tougher by the reputation of his father,
also named Rafael Angel.
   Though the elder Calderon founded the social security system and
was considered a champion of the common man, he also triggered the
only major election-related violence during the past half century
in Costa Rica.
   The father was president from 1940 until 1944. He ran again in
1948, alleging fraud when the count showed him the loser.
   Several hundred lives were lost in the strife that followed, and
Jose Figueres seized power. He abolished the armed forces and in
1949 ceded power to Otilio Ulate, the victor in the 1948 vote.
   The elder Calderon went into exile in Nicaragua, where his son
was born March 14, 1949.
   The younger Calderon began his political career at age 16 when
he was elected chief of high-school affairs for the Calderonist
Youth movement.
   At 21, he was named director of Social Security. He was elected
to the national legislature at 25 and four years later became
foreign minister.
   In an interview last week with The Associated Press, Arias said
he will now dedicate himself to working for the Arias Foundation
for Peace and Human Progress.

<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. is recalling eight models of
1985 Plymouths and Dodges that have flunked federal exhaust
emission standards, says the Environmental Protection Agency.
   The recall to replace part of the carburetor choke system
affects 383,700 vehicles: the Plymouth Horizon, Turismo, Reliant
and Reliant wagon; and the Dodge Omni, Charger, Aries and Aries
wagons, the EPA said.
   Chrysler agreed to the recall after the cars, all with 2.2-liter
engines, exceeded the allowed hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide
exhaust emission levels in routine EPA tests, the agency said.
   The recall does not affect cars sold in California.
   The manufacturer will replace the choke vacuum delay valve,
which allows a richer mixture of fuel and air when the engine is
started cold. Chrysler has designed an improved valve, the EPA
said. The work is to be done free by Chrysler-Plymouth or Dodge
dealers.

   Cuba now says it will jam Radio Marti 24 hours
a day.
   The action announced Monday marked the latest escalation in the
electronic war between Cuba and the United States.
   Cuba began jamming the Voice of America radio broadcasts during
the pre-dawn hours last month, then started interfering with
programming between 6 a.m. and noon.
   After the announcement that jamming would be carried out around
the clock, the VOA issued a statement saying, ``We deplore this
action, which is clearly designed to deny the Cuban people access
to uncensored information.''
   The jamming of the broadcasts began shortly after the agency
started testing TV signals to Cuba on March 27. Cuba has jammed the
TV tests each day since then.
   The Cuban government tolerated the Radio Marti broadcasts for
five years but reacted sharply to the introduction of TV Marti,
calling it a violation of national sovereignty, and started jamming
the long-accepted radio signals in addition to blocking the start
of TV Marti.

<HEAD>Police Protect Students Traveling on Subway</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY NEUMEISTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police officers have begun riding with students
on designated subway cars to protect the youngsters from being
robbed or assaulted on the way home from school.
   Nine officers started riding on selected trains Monday in a
two-month experiment involving five schools in Brooklyn. New York
City has 1,000 public schools and the subway, free for students, is
often the only way to class.
   Principal Jack M. Pollock of Abraham Lincoln High School in
Brooklyn suggested the program to stem the rise in gang-related
crime against students. Youths in groups of three or more carried
out 159 robberies or assaults from Jan. 1 to March 13 on the
subway, police said.
   ``There have been kids held up for jewelry, sneakers. That's
been on the increase over the last few years, especially with the
rise in crack,'' said Bob Terte, spokesman for city schools.
   Juan Charbonier, 17, welcomed riding a car patrolled by a
policeman. He recalled being attacked by a gang two years ago.
   ``I was on the train by myself and a posse of kids came on the
train and tried to rob me, tried to snuff me. I pulled out a knife
and sliced one of them,'' the soft-spoken teen-ager said matter of
factly. ``Then I never traveled by myself.''
   Other youngsters also liked riding with an officer on the
designated second-to-last car as they passed through Brooklyn on a
roughly 10-mile section of a subway line. At least one officer rode
the train until nearly all the students had gotten off.
   ``They keep us from getting into fights. We associate with some
of the cops,'' said Harold Brunsen, 16.
   The program operates from 1:30 p.m until rush hour begins about
two hours later. By then, subway cars are more crowded, offering
safety. Adults can also board the cars designated for students.
   Sgt. Mike Courtney, in charge of a patrol area covering several
stations, said officers are enthusiastic about the idea. Mingling
with officers will help students start to think of ``a policeman
being a human being,'' he said.
   ``Hey, sarge,'' one smiling teen-ager with schoolbooks said as
she waved from across the platform at Courtney.
   At least one student, 16-year-old Jamal James, was not
impressed. ``I think it's corny,'' he said.
   The program ran smoothly, although Courtney had to send one
officer on the student detail to answer a crime call elsewhere in
the subway system.
   Police said the subway has become more dangerous when school
lets out because some youths in loosely knit gangs rob, harass or
pick fights with other students. ``As inner-city youths are known
to do, they may pull out a knife or a gun,'' Courtney said.

<HEAD>NBC Plans to Offer 24-Hour News Service</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC plans to offer a 24-hour news service along
the lines of Cable News Network to its affiliate stations.
   The plan, which would let affiliates use the service for their
own broadcasts or when NBC is not broadcasting, could put NBC in
head-to-head competition with CNN; 51 of NBC's 208 affiliates also
are affiliated with CNN.
   NBC News President Michael Gartner said in a statement Monday
that many details have yet to be worked out. The network hopes to
unveil the service at the NBC affiliates' annual convention June
3-6 in Washington.
   The new service, according to one published report, could cost
$2 million to start and $8 million a year to run.
   James R. Sefert, chairman of the NBC affiliates' board,
characterized the idea as an extension of an NBC service called
A-News, which sends affiliates reports from NBC News and the
network's affiliates.
   He said he had seen no details of the plan but that based on NBC
officials' description, ``I think it's terrific.'' However, Sefert,
president of Cosmos Broadcasting Corp. in Greenville, S.C., said he
didn't know enough about the plan to say whether NBC-affiliated
stations would approve.
   ``We are still studying it,'' CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said
of NBC's plan. ``But we've developed very strong relationships with
220 broadcast affiliates over the 10 years that we've been in
business.
   ``We're certainly confident that those relationships will
persist.''
   Michael J. Corken, vice president and general manager of WTHR in
Indianapolis and head of the news subcommittee of the NBC affiliate
board, said he doesn't know whether he would drop CNN if NBC came
up with a similar service.
   ``I'd have to look and see what the viability of the
NBC-proposed system would be,'' he said.
   NBC in 1985 tried to buy 51 percent of CNN but failed because of
its insistence that NBC News have editorial control of any NBC-CNN
operation that would result.
   NBC's plan could become the first major network news push
against CNN in the pre-dawn hours since the early 1980s, when there
was the short-lived ``NBC News Overnight'' and CBS News'
``Nightwatch.''
   NBC's service would be separate from the network's regular
newscasts.

   The charred remnants of America's
two worst space tragedies, the 1967 Apollo fire and the 1986
Challenger explosion, will soon be united in an abandoned missile
silo miles from any plaque or memorial.
   The Apollo capsule will be moved from NASA's Langley Research
Center in Hampton, Va., where it has been in a shipping container
for 23 years, and buried atop the remains of the shuttle.
   No ceremony is scheduled when the capsule, its heat shield and
31 cartons of hardware and investigative material arrive on a
flatbed truck around May 20. No marker is planned.
   ``It's not as if by putting this in the silo we have forgotten
the contribution these guys have made to the program. There are
memorials'' elsewhere, said NASA spokesman Mark Hess. ``We didn't
think it was really appropriate that we do anything special or make
some kind of a public event out of this.''
   People will remember, regardless of what happens to the
spacecraft remains, Hess said. ``They will remember that as long as
there is a space program,'' he said.
   The families of the Apollo astronauts had no objections to the
plan, said John Lawrence, chief of congressional affairs for NASA's
Office of Space Flight.
   The agency never seriously considered putting the capsule or
other material on display, he said. ``Quite frankly, everybody
found the notion repugnant,'' Lawrence said.
   Derek Elliott, curator for the National Air and Space Museum,
part of the Smithsonian Institution, said he is interested in
acquiring the burned capsule, even though that seems unlikely at
this point.
   ``We're not thinking in terms of display. Our job is to collect
and preserve historic artifacts,'' Elliott said.
   Astronauts Virgil ``Gus'' Grissom, Roger B. Chaffee and Edward
H. White II died on Jan. 27, 1967, when fire engulfed the capsule
during a countdown rehearsal for the first manned Apollo mission.
The fire, in a cabin filled with 100 percent oxygen, was triggered
by a spark when a broken or bruised wire beneath Grissom's couch
contacted metal.
   After the accident, the capsule and other remains were placed in
a locked container at Langley and surrounded by a chainlink fence.
Until about 10 years ago, the corrugated metal container was kept
in a low-pressure nitrogen atmosphere to minimize corrosion. The
container has since developed small leaks.
   NASA said it decided to move the more than 17,600 pounds of
material to the missile silo at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station,
next to Kennedy Space Center, to avoid the necessary maintenance
and to free up space at Langley.
   About half the silo, which is 90 feet deep and 12 feet in
diameter, is filled with Challenger debris. Challenger remains also
fill another missile silo a quarter-mile away, as well as an
underground equipment room at each site.
   The 215,000 pounds of material salvaged from the Jan. 28, 1986,
explosion, which killed seven astronauts, was lowered by crane into
the waterproofed steel cylinders in 1987. Each of the approximately
5,000 items was catalogued and their location noted for future
retrieval.
   NASA twice has gone into the silos to remove engine pieces for
analysis.
   A similar procedure will be followed with the Apollo remains.
NASA wants the items accessible on ``the off-chance that maybe
there will be new investigative techniques developed or somebody
claims it was sabotage,'' Lawrence said.
   The two silos were used from 1961 through 1970 for Minuteman
missiles. The Air Force, which lent the deactivated silos to NASA,
uses the area for combat training.
   About eight miles away, also on Air Force property, is the
launch platform on which the Apollo craft burned. Weeds fill the
cracks in the brick and concrete pad.
   A bronze plaque was attached to the platform last fall by a
former volunteer at the nearby U.S. Air Force Space Museum who was
concerned by NASA's failure to recognize the spot, said museum
historian Ernest Malnassy.
   The plaque reads: ``They gave their lives in service to their
country in the ongoing exploration of humankind's final frontier.
Remember them not for how they died, but for those ideals for which
they lived.''
   Every year on Jan. 27, someone _ no one knows who _ places a
wreath at the site.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar drifted higher in Tokyo Tuesday, while
the Tokyo Stock Exchange barely managed to extend its rally for a
fifth trading day.
   The dollar ended the day at 158.05 yen, up 0.25 yen from
Monday's close of 157.80 yen. After opening at 158.15 yen, it
ranged between 157.95 yen and 158.25 yen.
   On the stock market, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average at one
point increased beyond 31,000 points but retreated to finish at
30,970.58, up just 14.31 points, or 0.05 percent, from Monday's
close. The Nikkei gained 782.63 points on Monday.
   Mitsuhiko Kinugasa, a currency dealer with Daiwa Bank, said
cross-trading with European currencies, especially the West German
mark and Swiss franc, was the focus of foreign exchange activity.
   ``There's been some speculative buying of the dollar'' in
advance of the U.S. Treasury note and bond auction due to begin
later Tuesday in Washington, Kinugasa said. ``But there's not much
happening with the yen and dollar. Cross-trading is the main
action.''
   The Treasury was scheduled to sell $10.5 billion in three-year
notes Tuesday, the first leg of its three-part, $30.5 billion
quarterly refunding.
   ``The dollar is unlikely to keep rising because sooner or later
investors will start selling it for profit-taking,'' said Akiyoshi
Sakai, a dealer with Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   The mood on the stock market was basically optimistic for the
short term, according to Chris Schreiber, a broker with New Japan
Securities Co.
   ``There's a general feeling that the currency is pretty stable.
Interest rates also seem stable, so short-term conditions look
pretty sound.''
   But he added that a 0.05 percentage point reduction in brokerage
commissions that took effect Tuesday was encouraging small
investors to take profits.
   ``The lower commission makes it easier for individual investors
to meet their profit targets,'' Schreiber said.
   Investors who trade small lots pay higher commissions, now a
maximum of 1.15 percent, under Tokyo's fixed-rate system.
   In bond dealings, the benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese
government bond strengthened. As of 3 p.m. it was listed at 86.43
points, up from 86.36 points Monday. The yield dropped to 7.280
points from Monday's or 7.295 percent. 10-year Japanese government
bond weakened to 86.29 from 86.36 Monday. That boosted the yield to
7.31 percent from 7.295 percent.

   In a slick new twist to street crime, hoods
have been oiling down an intersection and attacking motorists who
spin out on the goo.
   No serious injuries have been reported in the attacks over the
past month by the oilcan bandits wielding clubs, bottles and guns,
police said Monday.
   City cleanup crews have repeatedly spread sand on the slick but
now work only with a police escort after Molotov cocktails were
thrown at them, authorities said. On Monday, a TV news crew was
pelted with rocks and bottles.
   The L-shaped intersection in the Mission District abuts the
rundown, graffiti-scarred Bernal Housing Project, a multi-story
complex covering two blocks. The oil catches drivers stopped at
lights, police said.
   ``With the oil on the streets, the tires can't get a grip, and
the victims can't get away,'' said Lt. Al Casciato. ``They're just
helpless.''
   ``What we figure is happening is people going there to buy drugs
are being ripped off,'' he said. By the time officers arrive, the
victims have fled, he said.
   Police have arrested one suspect.
   One robbery has been directly linked to the oil slick, but
Casciato said residents call frequently to report assaults at the
slippery intersection.
   Early Saturday, Casciato watched a group of men drag a driver
out of a spun-out car and rob him. Officers chased the suspects
into the housing project, where they escaped, Casciato said.
   On Monday, a sandy stain remained on the street around a corner
where police say dealers openly sell crack and marijuana. One block
away, well-tended Victorian homes stand out against the bleak
projects.
   Sgt. Gile Pursley said Saturday's slick was as wide as two cars
and about 70 feet long. At least 15 gallons of goo too slick to
walk on covered the road, he said.
   The outline of a human figure was spray-painted by locals on the
asphalt next to the slogan ``211 victom (sic),'' a reference to the
penal code number for robbery.
   Since April 24, eight robberies have been reported in the area,
and three attempted robberies have been reported since May 1, one
of which was definitely grease-related, police said.

<HEAD>Contra Accord Is History Repeating Itself</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORALISA PILARTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An arrangement under which more than
13,000 Contra rebels are to disarm and be given land to work
parallels in some ways an earlier episode in 20th-century
Nicaraguan history.
   In 1932, a newly elected civilian government uneasily
co-existing with a strong military struck a peace pact with
recalcitrant guerrillas.
   In exchange for laying down their weapons, the rebels of the
1920s and 30s were promised a huge cooperative where they could
farm and live among their own. Augusto Cesar Sandino, the ``general
of free men'' who fought against the U.S. occupation of Nicaragua
for five years, had cut a deal with the elected government of
President Juan Bautista Sacasa.
   Sandino and his army of peasants were granted about a fourth of
the country to farm.
   Resentful of the pact and suspicious of the rebel general's
intentions, Gen. Anastasio Somoza, who headed the National Guard
created by the United States, had Sandino killed on Feb. 21, 1934.
   Less than two years later, Somoza seized power, starting a
43-year dynasty that ended on July 19, 1979, when the guerrillas of
the Sandinista National Liberation Front _ named after Sandino _
seized control of a popular uprising and ousted Somoza's son, also
named Anastasio.
   Now the U.S.-backed Contra rebels have cut a deal with the new
government of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro in exchange for
giving up their arms in a process that was to begin today.
   Mrs. Chamorro, elected Feb. 25 and inaugurated last month, is
struggling to bring peace to a country that has seen nine years of
war between the Contras and the leftist Sandinistas, who continue
to control the army.
   In exchange for disarming, the Contras, most of whom are
peasants, are to receive land in southern Nicaragua where they can
settle.
   The Contras had refused to fulfill a previous accord to lay down
their arms, saying they wanted Gen. Humberto Ortega, brother of
former President Daniel Ortega and a leader of the Sandinista
revolution, removed as commander in chief of the armed forces.
   The latest accord, reached last Friday, makes no mention of that
demand.
   Mrs. Chamorro's government, in a transition of power agreement
signed in March, allowed the Sandinistas to keep control of the
army in exchange for de-politicizing the body.
   She has said Gen. Ortega will keep his post only temporarily.
   In a gesture designed to show the civilian government's ultimate
control of the armed forces, Mrs. Chamorro took over the post of
defense minister herself.
   Contras and Sandinistas, both of whom understand military power
far better than political accommodation, remain suspicious of each
other.
   Since Mrs. Chamorro's April 25 inauguration, the Contras have
been gathering in security zones established on a rough north-south
line through central Nicaragua.

<HEAD>Racketeering Charge Dismissed Against Federal Judge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors have dropped the first-ever
charge of racketeering against a federal judge, but Robert Aguilar
still faces retrial on five charges.
   U.S. District Judge Louis Bechtle on Monday granted dismissal of
the racketeering charge and another count against Aguilar.
   Aguilar, 59, remains charged with leaking a wiretap, trying to
deceive the grand jury and the FBI and conspiring to influence a
fellow judge to grant favorable treatment to a felon. The charges
carry up to 25 years in prison.
   Bechtle also granted a defense request to delay the retrial from
June 4 to August because of a foot injury incurred by Aquilar's
chief attorney, Patrick Halliman. Halliman needs medication that
could affect his concentration.
   Bechtle did not rule on a defense request seeking government
documents to support Aguilar's claim he is being prosecuted for his
liberal rulings.
   The jury at Aguilar's first trial acquitted the U.S. District
Court judge March 19 of trying to influence a colleague in a felony
case, and deadlocked on seven other charges, including use of his
judgeship as a racketeering enterprise.
   The Justice Department then moved to dismiss the racketeering
charge, saying the one charge on which Aguilar was acquitted might
have left a fatal gap in the ``pattern of racketeering activity''
alleged in the indictment.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar inched up in Tokyo today after a
three-day decline, while the stock market extended its rally to a
fifth day with a marginal gain.
   The dollar closed at 158.05 yen, up 0.25 yen from Monday's close
of 157.80 yen. After opening at 158.15 yen, it ranged between
157.95 yen and 158.25 yen. The dollar had fallen 1.28 yen in the
three previous trading days.
   On the stock market, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average climbed
above 31,000 points briefly but closed at 30,970.58, up just 14.31
points, or 0.046 percent, from Monday's close. The Nikkei gained
782.63 points Monday.
   The benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese government bond
strengthened. As of 4 p.m. it was listed at 86.43 points, up from
86.36 on Monday. The yield dropped to 7.280 from Monday's 7.295
percent.
   ``Yen-dollar trading was quiet as market participants are
awaiting the start of (the U.S. Treasury bond) auction tonight,''
said Mamoru Tabata, a currency dealer with Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank.
``The dollar stayed in an extremely narrow range.''
   Masafumi Koyama, chief customer dealer at Bank of Tokyo, said
there was not much interest in yen-dollar deals among either buyers
or sellers. Trading against European currencies occupied center
stage, he said.
   ``Cross-trading against the (West German) mark, Swiss franc and
even the sterling pound will continue'' overnight, Koyama said.
   If the dollar weakens against those currencies, it will advance
no further than the lower 159-yen range against the yen, he
predicted .
   The stock market, meanwhile, is aiming at the 31,600 mark, where
it would recoup one-third of its losses this year, said Chris
Schreiber, a broker with New Japan Securities Co.
   But in today's trading, he added, ``every time it got up there
around 31,000, there was selling pressure.''
   He questioned whether the rally could be sustained, noting that
only the ``externals'' _ interest rates and currency stability _
were positive. Purchases centered on bargain hunting for stocks
with latent value in land holdings rather than profitability, he
said.
   ``The market's negative factors are still out there,'' he said,
citing a large number of margin purchases that will be dumped on
the market by June to make settlement deadlines.
   Some traders said that brokerages, not investors, were the main
buyers behind the rally.
   ``Brokers are trying to rescue issues from December,'' said
Julian Jones, a broker at W.I. Carr.
   The Nikkei peaked at the end of December before beginning a
slide of more than 25 percent. The slump apparently bottomed out
April 2.

<TEXT>
   The Bass family of Texas has donated $20
million to Yale University to study the environment and says its
largesse won't end there.
   The gift will establish the Yale Institute of Biospheric
Studies, which will take a broad interdisciplinary approach to
studying the biosphere _ that zone of the earth, from crust to
atmosphere, that contains living organisms.
   The donation is the biggest Yale has received since Paul Mellon,
a 1929 graduate, contributed more than $12 million in 1966-67 to
construct the Yale Center for British Art and an art collection
worth an estimated $35 million.
   ``This institute is an idea whose time has come,'' said Edward
Bass, a 1968 Yale graduate involved in a number of ecological
issues worldwide.
   He said his family will make several additional gifts over the
next 12 to 15 months to other areas of the university. He would not
disclose the sum.
   The gift will pay for laboratory and classroom renovations,
research, conferences, exhibitions and endowments. The gift also
provides a $2 million endowment for the directorship of Yale's
Peabody Museum of Natural History.
   Bass is chairman and chief executive of a venture and investment
capital company, and has numerous other business interests. Fortune
magazine in September placed the value of the Bass family fortune
at $5 billion.
   Outside Tucson, Ariz., his Space Biospheres Ventures has been
developing Biosphere II, a 2{-acre greenhouse-like, closed
ecological system designed to test applications for living in space.
   Bass' father and three brothers are also Yale graduates. Sid
Richardson Bass, a brother, is a Yale trustee. Previous gifts from
the family included $1 million to establish an expository writing
program.
   The institute will draw largely on the resources of the
departments of biology, geology and geophysics, along with the
School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, said Yale President
Benno C. Schmidt Jr.

percent.
   Most states have a limit of 0.1 percent; at least four states _
California, Maine, Oregon and Utah _ already have 0.08 percent
limits.
   A uniform standard among states would improve police handling of
drunken driving cases and would increase public awareness of the
problem, the council's board of directors said Monday in adopting
the policy.
   More than 23,000 people die and about 350,000 are seriously

<TEXT>
   Selma's first black school superintendent,
whose ouster sparked student boycotts and marches, has accepted an
undisclosed amount to leave early and drop his $10 million lawsuit
against the school board.
   Norward Roussell said Monday that the amount of the settlement
was close to what he would have received if his three-year,
$69,500-a-year contract had been renewed. The contract was to have
run out June 30.
   He said the settlement would be effective ``when I get the
money.''
   In announcing his resignation, he cited the stress of the
turmoil since the white-majority board voted in December not to
renew his contract. The move sparked near-continuous protests by
blacks, including a 5{-week sit-in at City Hall.
   Roussell had sued the city and the board, claiming racial
discrimination. The board said it dismissed him because of a
dictatorial management style.
   ``People are protesting because they want quality education for
their children,'' Roussell said in a telephone interview. ``This
protest has never been about me. It is not something I asked people
to do.''
   A leader of the continuing protests, Dallas County Commissioner
Perry Varner, said Roussell's resignation wouldn't affect the
demonstrations.
   ``We call them the Roussell wars and his situation was merely
one battle,'' Varner said. ``We're just as concerned about tracking
and other issues as his situation.''
   Critics said ``tracking'' had been used by school officials to
guide black students into lower-level classes regardless of their
ability. In his lawsuit, Roussell said his attempt to revise the
tracking system prompted his removal.
   School board member Dick Bean, who is white, said Roussell's
resignation could allow the board's racial split to begin healing.
   Selma's schools have about 6,000 students, 70 percent of them
black.

<TEXT>
   Shiites imprisoned by an Israeli-backed militia
in Lebanon will not be traded for Western hostages unless efforts
are made to include freedom for militiamen and Israeli soldiers in
the deal, the militia's commander says.
   The remarks by Gen. Antoine Lahad of the South Lebanon Army come
as Washington steps up pressure on Israel to free Arab detainees to
help win freedom for six Americans and 10 other Westerners held by
Shiite Moslem extremists in Lebanon.
   Lahad's remarks Monday appeared to reflect a hard line by Israel
toward any deal that excluded its own captives.
   ``I want to make clear ... that I cannot release anybody ...
just because of the foreigners,'' Lahad said in an interview on
Middle East Television. ``There is no way I can release (my
prisoners) unless there are negotiations to release SLA and Israeli
captives.''
   Lahad holds 300 Arab detainees, most of them Shiite Moslems, at
a jail two miles southeast of his headquarters in Marjayoun.
   Shiite extremist groups have demanded the release of detainees
held by Lahad and Israel. An Iranian newspaper suggested last week
that good will gestures by Israel would encourage the release of
additional Western hostages. Two Americans were freed last month.
   Lahad also told the television network that he has temporarily
stopped freeing prisoners for Moslem holidays to quell rumors that
such moves were part of a package deal to release Western hostages.
   When the publicity dies down, Lahad will resume the customary
prisoner release on Moslem holidays, the network quoted him as
saying.
   Sources close to Lahad's 2,500-member South Lebanon Army, which
gets training and supplies from Israel, said eight of his fighters
are held by Shiite groups.
   Israel, meanwhile, reiterated that it is not opposed to a swap
in principle, but that such an exchange should include three
Israeli servicemen captured in Lebanon in 1986 and believed held by
radical Shiites linked to the pro-Iranian Hezbollah militia.
   ``It is our stated policy that we are ready to contemplate an
exchange for the Israeli prisoners who are held by those
organizations,'' said Avi Pazner, a spokesman for Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   He denied there was any direct U.S. pressure on Israel to make
prisoner releases exclusively on behalf of Western hostages.
   Israel's most prominent prisoner is Sheikh Abdul-Karim Obeid, a
Shiite Moslem cleric. Obeid and two assistants were abducted by
Israel in July.
   Israel also holds 9,986 Palestinians detained during the
29-month uprising against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
   Of the Western hostages in Lebanon, the one held longest is
Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<TEXT>
   This university town has named a
commissioner to oversee the welfare of some 60,000 animals used in
experiments here each year.
   Dr. Stuart Wiles was named Monday to the position of
commissioner of laboratory animals established by the City Council
in June as part of the nation's first city ordinance to protect
animals used for research.
   Wiles, a veterinarian, will monitor Harvard University, the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and about a dozen other
academic and private firms that do about some $100 million per year
in animal research.
   ``This will keep scientists honest,'' said Gul Agha, who
initiated the legislation four years ago when he was a researcher
at MIT.
   ``It's an excellent precedent because we have two of the most
prestigious institutions in the country accepting accountability to
the public,'' Agha, who teaches computer science at the University
of Chicago at Urbana, said in a telephone interview.
   The ordinance, which covers all non-human vertebrates, defines
an experiment as any procedure a research institution conducts on a
live animal. Institutions covered include schools, colleges and
diagnostic laboratories.
   Federal law covers dogs, cats and monkeys but not reptiles,
amphibians, mice, rats and rabbits.
   Wiles' job will be to ensure that researchers provide proper
ventilation, nourishment and other care to lab animals.
   The commissioner has the right to make unannounced visits to
research sites, report infractions to the city manager, conduct
hearings and impose fines of $300 per day per violation.
   ``There are a great many people concerned about the welfare of
animals,'' Wiles said. ``But it's important to regulate _ not
over-regulate or place an unfair burden on the researchers.''

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The news from biologists that record flooding over
the past two weeks is likely to produce a bumper crop of mosquitoes
has been particularly unsettling to one group of Texans _ nudists.
   Claudia Adcock, manager of the Ponderosa Ranch nudist colony
near Wills Point, said her camp is putting up bird houses to lure
purple martins, which eat mosquitos ``like nobody's business.''
   Officials said pests such as mosquitoes, fleas and fire ants
will be plentiful because of the moisture this spring from the
worst flooding since 1908.
   Spring is a particularly tough time for nudists anyway because
many people are venturing out into the sun for the first time all
year.
   To protect novice nudists, Ponderosa keeps an ample supply of
insect repellent, sunburn ointment, poison-ivy lotion and other
skin-injury remedies.
   ``Sunburn is our biggest problem with newcomers,'' Ms. Adcock
said. ``If your butt ain't seen daylight before, you don't have any
idea how quickly it's going to burn.''

<HEAD>Beach Boy Wilson's Cousin Seeks to Take Over His Affairs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys crashed a
news conference called by cousin Stanley Love as Love was about to
announce his intention to become legal overseer of the musician's
estate and life.
   Wilson, 48, took the microphone at the Greater Los Angeles Press
Club on Monday and declared he was fit to handle his own affairs.
He dismissed allegations that therapist Eugene Landy controls his
every move.
   ``I have heard of the charges by Stan Love, and I think they're
outrageous,'' said Wilson.
   Wilson had just been served with a petition to appear at a June
22 conservatorship hearing in Superior Court, said Love's
spokesman, Warren Duffy.
   Love, brother of Beach Boy Mike Love, said Landy abused his role
as therapist by taking control of Wilson's finances and other
aspects of the singer's life. Landy generated controversy and lost
his psychology license after beginning a 24-hour treatment program
for Wilson.
   Wilson has credited Landy with helping him beat his drug and
alcohol addiction, slim down from more than 300 pounds and return
to a music career that featured the release of an acclaimed solo
record last year.
   Love, though, said he had taken care of Wilson for four years in
the late 1970s and believes Landy has improperly treated Wilson. He
said Wilson suffers from schizophrenia and an ``adaptive disorder.''
   ``If Brian went to the store and gave the checker a $100 bill
for a $2 item and the checker said, `May I keep the 98 bucks?'
Brian would say, `Sure.' That's Brian's problem the whole time,
whether it's the high level of LA or whether it's just a clerk at
the store,'' said Love, a former Los Angeles Laker.
   Wilson, who is producing his second solo album, denied he is
some sort of puppet.
   ``I see who I want to see when I want to see them. And I am
totally in charge of my whole life,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Two Colombians claiming to represent the
Medellin cartel offered $6 million in cocaine proceeds for Stinger
missiles and other weapons for use against aircraft carrying
Colombian officials, the FBI says.
   The two defendants ordered 120 of the shoulder-fired
ground-to-air missiles, FBI agent Charles A. Salemme testified at a
hearing Monday.
   The men, who claimed to work for reputed cartel kingpin Pablo
Escobar, told undercover agents they were willing to pay $5 million
from the sale of a half-ton or more of cocaine for the missiles, 50
automatic rifles and a plane to carry them, Salemme said.
   An additional $1 million would be paid to those who would steal
the weapons from the military, Salemme told U.S. Magistrate Thomas
Wilson in Tampa.
   Instead of getting the Stingers, the men were arrested.
   Alfredo Antonio Ramos-Tinoco, 47, and Luis Fernando
Arcila-Giraldo, 28, were ordered held without bail on charges of
conspiracy to receive stolen property and export arms illegally.
They were also charged with drug trafficking.
   No cash or weapons ever changed hands in the deal, the latest of
several attempts by drug traffickers to obtain Stingers,
authorities said. Federal officials say none of the earlier
negotiations had gone as far as the deal foiled Saturday.
   The Colombians said the weapons were intended to show the
Colombian government it was getting too close to the drug cartel,
officials said. They planned to use the missiles to shoot down
government helicopters in Colombia, investigators said.
   FBI officials said a Stinger on the legitimate arms market costs
about $14,000. The 4-foot, 35-pound missile uses an infrared homing
device to target the heat generated by the engine of a plane or
helicopter.
   Allen McCreight, head of the FBI's Tampa office, said it was not
known whether the negotiations for the weapons were directed by
Escobar.
   Violence linked to Colombia's drug lords has claimed the lives
of three presidential candidates in that country in the past year.

<HEAD>Seven Killed In Beirut's Christian Battles</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rival Christian forces battled with
artillery through the night, setting hospitals on fire and killing
seven people as up to 30 shells a minute rained down on residential
areas, police said today.
   Buildings burned out of control, reddening the night sky, while
howitzer and rocket salvos roared overhead.
   In addition to the battles in east Beirut, the two sides traded
heavy shelling around the port of Jounieh, 12 miles to the north,
police said.
   The barrages eased around 5 a.m. into mortar and machine-gun
clashes between rebel Gen. Michel Aoun's troops and the Lebanese
Forces militia, led by Samir Geagea. Police said 14 people were
wounded.
   In all, 19 people have been killed and 41 wounded since fighting
broke out Monday after a two-week lull in the struggle between Aoun
and the Lebanese Forces for control of the country's Christian
enclave.
   Police said the fatalities included a family of five killed when
a salvo hit their building in the Aoun-controlled town of Fanar in
Metn province north of Beirut.
   A total of 941 people have been killed and 2,497 wounded since
Jan. 30, when Aoun moved against Geagea's forces. Most of the
casualties have been civilians.
   The battles have been some of the worst between Christian forces
since the Lebanese civil war broke out in April 1975. Most of the
war has pitted Christians against Moslems.
   In today's fighting, Aoun's 130mm howitzers fired salvo after
salvo into Geagea's strongholds in the city's Ashrafiyeh and
Karantina neighborhoods, where the Lebanese Forces have their
headquarters, police said.
   Geagea's forces unleashed barrages of 122mm rockets from
30-barrel truck-mounted launchers into the Aoun-held districts of
Badaro and Furn el-Shubbak.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be identified under standing
regulations, said a military hospital in Badaro controlled by Aoun
was severely damaged by a rocket barrage that set it ablaze.
   Aoun's gunners hammered the Hospital de Notre Dame du Liban in
Jounieh, which is controlled by Geagea's fighters.
   ``I was in my room when the shells started falling,'' said an
unidentified patient in an interview on Geagea's Lebanese
Broadcasting Corp. television station.
   ``Despite my wound, I left the bed and hid in the closet. I
stayed there until nurses came and took me to the shelter on a
stretcher,'' he said.
   The station showed the patient's room which, like most of the
hospital, took several direct hits. The man's bed was shredded and
there was a gaping hole in the ceiling.
   The bearded patient was interviewed in the seven-story
hospital's underground bomb shelter.
   Upstairs, a carpet of debris and broken glass covered the
corridors.
   Smoke shrouded several districts as apartment buildings and gas
stations burned. Several trucks carrying food across the the
capital's dividing Green Line were hit late Monday and set on fire.
   The fighting has caused damage estimated at $1 billion and
forced 400,000 of the Christian enclave's 1 million people to flee.
   Civilians who had been trapped in their offices Monday, when the
shelling escalated sharply, took advantage of the lull at dawn
today to race home to check on their families.

   The dollar gained slightly against the Japanese
yen today but declined against the West German mark.
   Gold prices edged higher.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 158.05 yen, up 0.25 yen from
Monday's close of 157.80 yen. The dollar had fallen 1.28 yen in the

<TEXT>
   Jurors convicted a man of eight felony
counts, including assault with a deadly weapon, in an attack on the
daughter of the late John Wayne and her boyfriend.
   Jerrell Hintergardt, 38, who made a surprise confession in court
last week, faces sentencing June 8. He was convicted Monday.
   The prosecution alleged that Hintergardt and private
investigator Oded Daniel Gal were hired by Aissa Wayne's former
husband, Dr. Thomas Gionis, to attack her and boyfriend Roger Luby
in October 1988.
   Gionis allegedly arranged the beatings at Luby's Newport Beach
home because of a custody dispute with Ms. Wayne over their
daughter, Anastasia, then two years old.
   Gionis, who is awaiting trial, has pleaded innocent to charges
of conspiracy and assault.
   Ms. Wayne and Luby were forced into the garage where they were
tied up and beaten. They cut Luby's achilles tendon.
   Prosecutors allege that Gionis paid Gal $43,000 to arrange the
attack and that Gal hired Hintergardt and Jeffrey Kendall Bouey to
carry it out. Gal and Bouey still face charges and are free on bail.
   Gionis, a neurosurgeon, was divorced from Ms. Wayne in 1987, and
the couple went to court in 1988 over who would get custody of
Anastasia.
   The little girl has been kept by her mother, pending the outcome
of Gionis' trial.

<DATELINE>KALAPANA, Hawaii (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The massive outpouring of molten rock
from Kilauea Volcano has come to a temporary halt as a lava flow
that has burned its way through much of this coastal community
finally reached the ocean.
   Officials are keeping a close watch on acid formed when the lava
hits the ocean. Hot lava mixing with salt water produces steam
clouds, known as laze,that contain hydrochloric acid and other
hazardous chemicals.
   Trade winds are blowing the gas out to sea, said Bruce Butts,
deputy administrator of Hawaii County Civil Defense.
   The flow entered the ocean just west of Harry K. Brown State
Park about a quarter-mile north of the town, Butts said.
   Before it stopped at noon Monday, the lava had been gushing from
the Kupaianaha opening of the volcano at a rate of 650,000 cubic
yards a day, feeding the 8-mile-long lava flow that has destroyed
61 homes in this community since April 4.
   Geologists said they do not know whether the halt in the lava
flow signals the end of Kilauea's eruption that began Jan. 3, 1983.
   ``If it holds true to form, it'll be only a pause,'' said Reggie
Okamura of the U.S. Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano
Observatory.
   Instruments monitoring the vent, or volcano opening, and the
earlier primary Pu'i O'o vent show continued tremor, indicating
molten rock is continuing to move in the vent system, Okamura said.
   Drainage from the flow is entering the ocean, and should do so
for the next two or three days, Butts said.
   The flow has destroyed 139 homes in Kalapana since the eruption
began more than seven years ago. Only 34 homes remained untouched,
and most have been evacuated.

<HEAD>Gulf Oil Leak Appears to Disperse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MORGAN CITY, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texaco began skimming more than 37,000
gallons of oil that spilled into the Gulf of Mexico after it shut a
pipeline suspected of leaking.
   The company sent a skimmer to clean the area and requested two
more, although Texaco said it had not determined the cause or who
was responsible for the leak.
   ``Let's just say there's oil in the Gulf. At this time we don't
know if it's ours or not,'' said Texaco spokesman Max Hebert.
   Coast Guard Cmdr. Dave Beach said the leak was discovered Sunday
morning near Eugene Island, about 100 miles off the Louisiana
coast. By Monday afternoon the Coast Guard estimated that 37,800
gallons of oil had leaked into the Gulf.
   Initial indications were that the leak may have occurred in a
pipeline serving 36 drilling platforms in the congested area,
Texaco said. The pipeline is operated by Texaco and is owned by
Marathon, Exxon, Mobil, Texaco, Chevron and Conoco.
   Divers were investigating the 20-inch pipeline to try to
pinpoint the source of the leak.
   Seas were moderate in the area Monday and the oil was expected
to disperse in the open Gulf, Texaco said.
   ``The latest report we got late Monday evening was that the
three heaviest brown patches had decreased in size, mainly into
three streaks covering an area roughly eight by 22 miles,'' Beach
said.
   ``Basically, it's spreading out into a lighter sheen and there's
a lot less heavy oil showing,'' he said.
   After testing all pipelines and platforms in the area, the
Eugene Island Pipeline System was shut down at about 1 a.m. Monday,
Texaco said.
   ``At this stage it's still in the minor category,'' said Beach.
``If everyone has shut down as requested, all you're going to get
from now on is just a minor amount of oil coming from the line.''
   Texaco had notified the companies using the oil line to suspend
operation by Monday, officials said.

   Two moderate earthquakes shook central
Iran, demolishing a school and a number of houses in the village of
Islamabad and surrounding areas, Tehran radio reported today.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, did not say whether there
were any casualties.
   The stronger quake registered 4.8 on the Richter scale of ground
motion, the radio said. The temblors shook the southern township of
Semiran in central Isfahan province once at dawn and again at dusk
Monday.
   The radio said southern villages have been shaken by earthquakes
57 times in the past month.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 4 on the Richter scale can cause moderate
damage in a populated area, and one of 5 can cause considerable
damage.

   President F.W. de Klerk is
seeking support from Western Europe for his white government's
efforts to bring the black majority into the South African
political system.
   De Klerk plans to leave today on a tour of nine nations in
Western Europe, which South African officials call the most
important foreign trip by a South African leader in decades. It
also is an important test of South Africa's bid to end its
international isolation.
   The government's hopes of improving its foreign standing after
years of sanctions were boosted after it reached an agreement last
week with the African National Congress, the leading anti-apartheid
group, after their first talks. The two sides agreed to work
together to end political violence and clear the way for full
constitutional talks on ending white-minority rule.
   ``It is the accord reached ... last week which the world will
see as progress towards a new democratic South Africa,'' said one
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In a sign of a new willingness to deal with South Africa, French
President Francois Mitterrand, who has shunned South African
leaders in the past, will now hold talks with de Klerk. De Klerk
will also see British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, King Juan
Carlos of Spain and many presidents and prime ministers.
   He begins his trip in France and then goes on to Belgium, Italy,
West Germany, Britain, Spain, Switzerland, Greece and Portugal. The
Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it is the most extensive trip by a
South African head of state since the governing National Party came
to power in 1948.
   South African political analysts say the most important aspect
of the trip is de Klerk's hope of easing South Africa's diplomatic
and political isolation. De Klerk, who has launched major reforms
to end the apartheid system of racial separation, will explain his
policies to European governments.
   De Klerk will also be looking for support for his political
plans. West European nations have been an important source of aid
and support for the African National Congress, which de Klerk hopes
will help to control more radical black elements that oppose any
peaceful agreement with the white government.
   De Klerk is also expected to ask European nations to ease or end
sanctions imposed against his country to protest apartheid.
Sanctions have hurt the South African economy.
   While de Klerk has little hope of persuading European nations to
curtail sanctions, he may lay the groundwork for an easing of
sanctions in the future.

   A Los Angeles bank that allegedly was used by
Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos to launder money stolen from their
country has been turned over to the Philippine government.
   The bank, estimated by a defense attorney to be worth $20
million to $30 million, was transferred Monday in a significant
victory for the government of President Corazon Aquino.
   The Philippines is trying to recover more than $220 million
allegedly embezzled by the Marcoses from the country's treasury
during Marcos' 20 years in power.
   A newspaper reported today that the Marcoses doled out about
$8.5 million to politicians, reporters and others in the last 100
days of the Philippine dictator's regime in a desperate attempt to
retain power.
   An accused political assassin who received about $50,000 was
among dozens of cash recipients during the spending spree,
according to a palace ledger the Los Angeles Times said it obtained
a copy of.
   The transfer of all shares in the California Overseas Bank to
the Manila government was part of a March 16 plea bargain in
federal court, where Mrs. Marcos is on trial. The bank had pleaded
guilty to wire fraud.
   The bank was owned by Robert S. Benedicto, a one-time Marcos
crony whom prosecutors charged with conspiring to help Marcos shift
stolen money to secret Swiss accounts and other personal uses.
   Mrs. Marcos is alleged to have participated with her husband in
the embezzlement, using the money to live in luxury and invest in
New York real estate. Co-defendant Adnan Khashoggi, the Saudi
financer, is accused of helping the Marcoses conceal ownership of
the New York properties.
   Marcos was indicted with his wife but died in exile in Hawaii in
September.
   Benedicto, also indicted and listed as a fugitive by the court,
was dropped from the case as part of the plea bargain.
   Two former officials of the bank testified last week that
Benedicto had said he bought the institution for $7 million in 1976
because Marcos ``needed the bank,'' and that he had personally
managed several accounts whose owners were known only to himself.
   Prosecutors said the accounts belonged to the Marcoses and were
used to launder money being funneled to other accounts, to buy a
Manhattan office building and Mrs. Marcos' jewelry, and to provide
two Marcos children with $10,000-a-month allowances.
   The register of cash expenses disclosed by the Los Angeles Times
made no apparent reference to the expenses related to her trial in
New York, but showed that Mrs. Marcos gave generous gifts to
members of the national press corps during her husband's 1986
presidential campaign against Mrs. Aquino.
   Those gifts included watches and envelopes, each stuffed with
the equivalent of about $250.
   Three days after the election but before results were announced,
Mrs. Marcos was host of a dinner for employees of an agency that
investigates election fraud in Manila, the ledger showed. At each
of the 55 place settings was an envelope stuffed with the
equivalent of about $500.
   The ledger also credits Arturo Pacificador, a Marcos associate
and former member of Parliament, with receiving about $50,000 five
days after the assassination of Evilio Javier, director of the 1986
Aquino campaign in Antique province. Pacificador was indicted in
connection with the slaying and is a fugitive.
   The ledger was seized along with other palace documents by the
new Philippine government after Marcos fled a popular revolt on
Feb. 25, 1986 and Mrs. Aquino was installed as president.

<HEAD>Moscow Visit Stirs Emotions of American Legion Band Members</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Muscovites stopped on the street and some leaned
out of windows to clap and try to sing along as an American Legion
marching band played ``God Bless America'' outside a hotel near the
Kremlin.
   ``Let me tell you, it was one of the most emotional times of my
life,'' the band's leader, Dorothy Hill, said today. She said the
two impromptu concerts Sunday and Monday proved that peace is
possible between the superpowers.
   ``The people there watching and listening were shedding tears,
we were shedding tears. I never saw such emotion in my life,'' said
Mrs. Hill, a 74-year-old World War II Coast Guard veteran.
   ``It proved my point right there _ that reaction of your people
and our people _ that peace is possible,'' she told reporters.
   Mrs. Hill charmed and plodded her way through the Soviet
bureaucracy for three years to bring the 70-member, all-male
American Legion band from Waltham, Mass., to Moscow on what she
called a ``peace move.''
   On Wednesday, it will march in Red Square in the Soviet Union's
annual Victory Day parade celebrating the defeat of Nazi Germany.
Mrs. Hill said Soviet officials have told her it will be the first
American band to join the parade.
   But band members have already gotten an emotional charge from
their two concerts outside the Hotel Rossiya, where they struck up
``God Bless America,'' as well as the Soviet and U.S. national
anthems.
   Muscovites who had watched curiously soon began to sing along as
best they could. Some people leaned out of the hotel windows, and
began clapping.
   John ``Jake'' Comer of Quincy, Mass., past national commander of
the American Legion, said the tears ``just came out of my eyes'' as
the band played ``God Bless America'' and he held the Soviet and
U.S. flags during the impromptu concerts.
   ``I've been to 18 countries, to Nicaragua, had an audience with
the pope, visited the Oval Office with Presidents Reagan, Bush.''
he said. ``I've done everything. But nothing as moving as that.''
   Mrs. Hill said she began planning the trip about three years ago
after having a dream ``that we should never see another war.''
   With no contacts in Moscow, she just stayed up through the early
morning hours and dialed telephone operators in Moscow, trying to
find out who to contact.
   After dialing night after night, she finally found one helpful
telephone operator who put her in touch with the Soviet Peace
Committee, ``and once we got them, the show was on the road.''
   The Joseph P. Hill American Legion Band, named for Mrs. Hill's
late husband, arrived Moscow on Saturday on a 10-day trip. Its
members range in age from 17 to 82, and include veterans of wars in
Europe, Japan, Korea and Vietnam.
   At a ceremony today at the headquarters of the Soviet Peace
Committee, its chairman, Genrik Borovik, praised Mrs. Hill as a
``remarkable, wonderful woman.''
   ``I'm happy that she broke American bureaucracy and Soviet
bureaucracy just coming straight to ... the Soviet Peace
Committee,'' he said.
   Borovik called the event unusual, because the American Legion
``always was considered as a very right-wing organization, which
was always, let me say, not the best friend of the Soviet Union.''
   Borovik is a television commentator who, in the years before
Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power, often critized U.S. foreign
policy in his commentaries.

   Estonia today dropped the words
``Soviet Socialist'' from its name and adopted the republic's old
tricolor flag in place of the red banner of socialism as it took
another step toward independence.
   The Estonian parliament, without formally declaring
independence, reinstituted several paragraphs from the Baltic
republic's 1938 constitution, including an opening proclamation
that Estonia is ``an independent republic, with the supreme state
power vested in the people.''
   Nationalist parliamentarians regard the move as another step in
a phased march toward independence and not in itself a formal break
with Moscow.
   The parliament also declared that the step, in large part
symbolic, was intended as a show of solidarity with the sister
Baltic republics of Lithuania and Latvia, which have declared full
independence.
   All three republics were forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in
1940.
   The vote today was 73 in favor, 14 against, with two
abstentions, eight members present but not voting, and eight
absent. The measure passed with three votes more than the required
two-thirds majority of the legislature's total membership.
   Minutes after the vote was taken in the Estonian Supreme Soviet,
the red flag with its hammer and sickle was lowered from the roof
of the ancient parliament building and a new flag with cornflower
blue, black and white stripes was raised in its place.
   A small crowd gathered in the cobblestone square to see what
would follow, but there was no immediate attempt to cover the giant
hammer and sickle crest that has adorned the front of the building
for five decades.
   Estonia, which in November 1988 became the first of the 15
Soviet republics to proclaim its sovereignty from Moscow, has taken
repeated steps in recent months to establish a separate identity
without provoking a confrontation with President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev over the issue of independence.
   The nearby Baltic republic of Lithuania, which declared
independence on March 11, is now the target of an economic blockade
in which the Soviets have cut the flow of oil, natural gas and
other critical raw materials.
   The third Baltic republic, Latvia, declared independence on May
4, and is now waiting to hear whether Gorbachev will impose
sanctions similar to those he slapped on Lithuania.
   The Estonian parliament today adopted a resolution
congratulating Latvia on declaring independence, and declaring
Baltic solidarity.
   ``We congratulate the (Latvian) Supreme Soviet and the whole
population of Latvia on the occasion of adopting the independence
declaration of the Latvian republic,'' said the statement, which
was broadcast on Radio Estonia and monitored by the British
Broadcasting Corp. in Britain.
   ``The path to our own statehood is not easy, but we are
convinced that here, in the Baltics _ acting together _ will arrive
at a restoration of our independent states more fruitfully than if
each were to struggle on its own,'' the statement said.
   Tallinn deputy Mart Laar said Estonia already is feeling the
effects of the Soviet oil and natural gas embargo against
Lithuania, because a Lithuanian refinery processes 50 percent of
Estonia's gasoline.
   The Estonians have been trying for weeks to start talks with the
Kremlin leading toward eventual independence, but Moscow so far has
refused.
   The Estonian Independent, an English-language weekly in the
capital of Tallinn, reported in its most recent edition that
Gorbachev adviser Alexander Yakovlev told Estonian Supreme Soviet
chairman Arnold Ruutel that no negotiations could start unless the
parliament suspended a March 30 ruling that invalidated the Soviet
constitution on Estonian territory.
   The action today carried Estonia a step further and said that
dropping of Soviet symbols was ``guided by the decision'' of March
30. The law adopted today made the offical name ``the Estonian
Republic.''
   Ethnic Estonians make of 64 percent of the overall population of
1.5 million. The ethnic Russian minority makes up 30 percent.

<HEAD>Shiite Leader Fears Western Hostage May Be Slain If Missing
Iranians Dead</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA ABU-NASR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Shiite Moslem leader said today he
believes no more Western hostages will be freed until the Israelis
and their Lebanese militia allies release some 400 Lebanese Shiite
and Palestinian captives.
   Hussein Musawi, leader of the fundamentalist Islamic Amal
faction, also voiced fears that one of the Western hostages in
Lebanon could be killed if four missing Iranians are found to have
been slain by Christian militiamen.
   Musawi's remarks were seen as an effort to pressure Washington
to make a conciliatory gesture toward Iran and the hostage-takers
following last month's release of two American captives.
   Iran and its Lebanese Shiite allies have asked the United States
to help determine the fate of the four missing Iranians who were
seized eight years ago and pressure Israel and its militia allies
in south Lebanon to release their prisoners.
   ``If the kidnappers' mind is sound and their religion is sound,
they will not free any more hostages,'' said Musawi, the reputed
mentor of some of the hostage takers. ``And I think they won't.
   ``If the Americans want to solve the hostage issue, they should
solve the problem of the Moslems and the oppressed held by Israel
and its surrogates,'' he added.
   But Musawi warned that if the four Iranians were found to have
been slain, it could prompt a violent reaction by those holding the
hostages.
   ``If the death of the four Iranians is ascertained, that will
definitely affect the hostage issue. One of the kidnap groups might
react by murdering a hostage,'' Musawi said.
   ``I don't have any concrete information on that. But they've
done it before. What's there to stop them from doing it again?'' he
told The Associated Press in a telephone interview from his
headquarters in the ancient town of Baalbek in east Lebanon's Bekaa
Valley.
   Musawi's pro-Syrian faction is part of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, which is believed to be linked to the
Shiite extremists holding most of the 16 remaining Western
hostages, including six Americans.
   The longest held is American Terry Anderson, Chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped in Beirut
March 16, 1985.
   The four Iranians were seized by right-wing Lebanese Forces
militiamen north of Beirut in July 1982.
   Iran has repeatedly demanded their release. But the four men are
widely believed to have been killed either in civil war shelling or
by their captors.
   Lebanese Forces commander Samir Geagea said in August 1988 that
after he took over the militia two years earlier he found no trace
of the missing Iranians. He blamed his predecessor, Elie Hobeika,
for their disappearance and apparent slaying.
   Last October, Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani said that if
the men are dead, the militiamen can at least ``give us back their
bodies or show us their graves.''
   Musawi is the reputed mentor of the pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad
for the Liberation of Palestine, which holds American professors
Alann Steen and Jesse Turner.
   The group freed American educator Robert Polhill, 55, on April
22 after he spent 39 months in captivity.
   The move was followed by the April 30 release of another
American, Frank Reed, 57, who was held hostage for 42 months by a
group calling itself the Organization of Islamic Dawn.
   President Bush has publicly thanked Iran and Syria for helping
secure their freedom. Bush has said the United States could try to
help determine the fate of the four missing Iranians.
   Israeli officials reiterated that they are not opposed to a
prisoner swap in principle, but stressed that an exchange should
include three Israeli servicemen captured in Lebanon in 1986 and
believed held by radical Shiites linked to Hezbollah.
   ``It is our stated policy that we are ready to contemplate an
exchange for the Israeli prisoners who are held by those
organizations,'' said Avi Pazner, a spokesman for Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir.

   Terry Anderson, the longest held of the 16
Western hostages, helped fellow prisoners make Scrabble and
Monopoly games to amuse themselves, according to a newly freed
captive.
   His guards are giving him and other hostages plenty of
diversions, according to an account given by former hostage Frank
Reed to Anderson's sister, Peggy Say.
   ``They have a lot of things which was encouraging to me; at
least they did at the time Frank was there,'' Mrs. Say said. These
included boxes of books, writing materials and dominoes.
   Although Anderson, 42, the chief Middle East correspondent for
The Associated Press, is in good physical condition from plenty of
exercise, he is tired and needs dental care, Mrs. Say said. She
said the hostages are blindfolded and chained in line with their
preference.
   ``Frank preferred a chain on his wrist,'' she said. ``Terry
preferred a chain on his ankle so that his arms are free to write
and play cards.''
   The closest she and Reed were able to calculate that he last saw
Anderson was somewhere between a year and 18 months ago. Reed spent
20 months with Anderson and Thomas Sutherland in Lebanon. For a
period of time, the three American hostages were together with two
others, John McCarthy and Brian Keenan.
   Reed, the director of the private Lebanon International School,
was freed April 30 after being held for 44 months. He is undergoing
medical checkups at Andrews Air Force Base in suburban Maryland and
met with Mrs. Say Monday night.
   Anderson is in his sixth year of captivity. Sutherland was a
dean at the American University of Beirut. McCarthy is a British
television journalist. Keenan, who is Irish, taught English at
American University.
   ``He is still a vindictive hearts player,'' Mrs. Say said of her
brother. Reed told her Anderson also reads voraciously, a book a
day.
   Reed said Anderson could pick up some things in Arabic from the
radio and have at least some idea of what he thought was going on
in the world. But his guards have made a concerted effort to keep
from him news of the deaths of his father and brother, both from
cancer, within four months of each other in 1986. Mrs. Say said she
believes that he still does not know.
   ``That's very difficult,'' she said. ``Part of you wants him to
have known and dealt with it and part of you believes it might be
too much for him if he found out in captivity.''
   But with his mind still sharp, he thinks of new birthdays
painfully uncelebrated for the two daughters he cares for so deeply.
   He is wracked with anguish at missing more than five years with
them, unable to savor the passage of Gabrielle from child to woman.
In Anderson's sixth year of captivity, Gabrielle turned 14 on April
26.
   He has never held Sulome, who was born three months after he was
kidnapped in Moslem west Beirut on March 16, 1985, by Islamic
Jihad, a group loyal to Iran. She will be 5 on June 7.
   ``He was very verbal about his love of them and that was what he
wanted when he got out, to see his daughters,'' Mrs. Say said.
   Unlike Reed, who said he was brutally beaten by his kidnappers
for trying to escape twice, Anderson was left alone. Mrs. Say said
Reed told her Anderson was not beaten.
   Reed told Mrs. Say that her brother was aware of her tireless
campaign to free him and the other hostages.
   Mrs. Say, 49, shuttles between Washington and her home in
Kentucky. She has made several trips to the Middle East seeking his
release. She has met with President Bush, Pope John Paul II, the
archbishop of Canterbury and PLO leader Yasser Arafat. She fields
phone calls all hours of the day and night.
   ``The guards told him (Anderson) everytime I did something of
major import,'' Mrs. Say said. ``Because it has been a criticism
that I've heard, I said to him (Reed), `Does Terry think what I'm
doing is making him be held longer?' And he said, `Absolutely not.
That only gives him hope.'''

<HEAD>Governor Says Breslin Not Racist</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Language in 8th graf may be offensive to some readers.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Mario Cuomo said Newsday columnist Jimmy
Breslin is not a racist despite an expletive-filled outburst
against a reporter of Korean descent who had criticized him.
   The governor on Monday called Breslin's comments about the
reporter ``dumb and offensive,'' but said his longtime friend
should not be judged solely on the ``outrageous'' way he chose to
talk in the newsroom.
   ``He's certainly not racist, ethnic. He's been a champion of
open-mindedness,'' Cuomo said.
   Cuomo spoke after six state legislators sent telegrams to
Newsday editors Donald Forst and Anthony Marro urging them to
suspend Breslin.
   Chiara Coletti, a Newsday spokeswoman, said the newspaper would
have no response until after a meeting scheduled for tonight with
Forst, Marro and the Asian-American editorial staff.
   On Sunday, three Asian-American groups called for Breslin's
resignation after the outburst of sexual and racial slurs against
staff reporter Ji-Yeon Mary Yuh, 25, who had sent him an internal
computer message calling his May 3 column sexist.
   Breslin wrote in the column that his wife, City Councilwoman
Ronnie Eldridge, devoted too much time to government duties and not
enough time to him or the home. In his Monday column, the
61-year-old Pulitzer Prize winner described the article as
``conscious humor.''
   After receiving Yuh's message, Breslin called her ``a yellow
cur'' and ``slant-eyed'' in a newsroom outburst, New York Newsday
reported.
   In an apology sent to Newsday staff in an internal computer
message, Breslin said: ``I am no good and once again I can prove
it. ... I am sorry. I said things I shouldn't have said. The racial
and sexual insults I spewed are never appropriate.''
   The governor said Breslin ``wrote one of the most elegant and
persuasive apologies I've ever read. How can you beat up on a guy
who says, `I'm no good and I've proved it once again.'''
   On Monday, the New York Association of Black Journalists wrote
to Marro, calling for Breslin's suspension.
   ``We recognize in the past Jimmy Breslin has been a champion of
minorities and the disadvantaged, but these most recent comments
cannot be excused or tolerated in any newsroom setting,'' the
letter said.
   Breslin, who writes about New York City in hard-bitten,
streetwise fashion, won a Pulitzer for commentary in 1986.

   A British military jet participating in a

dawn today, officials said.
   Searchers found plane wreckage, but the pilot of the AV-8

   Officials said the cause of the crash was not immediately known.
The pilot's name was withheld.
   The vertical take-off and landing jet crashed into the sea 10
miles from the British aircraft carrier Invincible.
   The jet was taking part in ``Dragon Hammer,'' an annual NATO
exercise in the central and western Mediterranean involving units
from Italy, Turkey, the Netherlands, France, Spain, Britain and the
United States.

   Thousands of radical students
boycotted classes and held rallies today after dissidents urged
nationwide protests this week aimed at toppling President Roh
Tae-woo's government.
   About 2,000 students armed with firebombs and rocks fought riot
police at the gate of Seoul National University, shouting demands
that Roh resign and dissolve the giant governing party formed by a
three-party merger.
   Violent protests also were reported on at least seven other
campuses in Seoul and two provincial cities, but no overall figures
or details were available. The newspaper Chosun Ilbo reported
anti-government rallies on 30 campuses across the nation.
   ``Destroy the ruling party!'' demonstrators shouted as their
leaders urged students across the nation to join in protests aimed
at forcing the Democratic Liberal Party to disband.
   Dissidents have planned anti-Roh protests in 17 cities beginning
Wednesday, when the newly enlarged governing party holds its first
national convention.
   Also today, taxi union leaders in Seoul decided to stage a
street rally Thursday to press demands for a 17.3 percent wage
increase. Union drivers planned to gather in southern Seoul in
thousands of company taxis and, if police block them, to start
street protests with honking horns.
   Roh, whose party had been losing popularity, secured a majority
of seats in the National Assembly in January with a merger of his
party with two minor opposition groups.
   Dissidents contend the merger was an attempt by conservatives to
prolong their power. They also accused Roh of backpedaling from
earlier promises of reforms.
   Roh warned South Koreans in a nationally televised speech Monday
that the nation is at a crossroads where it can either be ``on a
road toward progress or fall into a road toward chaos.''
   Roh appealed for industrial and social peace to prevent chaos.
But radicals accused him of using concern over the economy as a
ploy to suppress labor activity and political dissent.
   In efforts to reinvigorate the economy, Roh's government ordered
49 major business groups today to sell excess real estate holdings
or face unfavorable treatment in taxes and loans.
   The measure was intended to combat soaring housing prices and
rampant land speculation. Government officials hope companies will
invest more in export industries.
   South Korea's top 30 conglomerates are reported to own real
estate worth at least $18 billion, although it is not known how
much of the total is held for speculation.
   The government also barred the 49 business groups from buying
new land and buildings until June 1991.
   Critics had accused Roh of favoring big companies and of
incompetent policies that triggered inflation and economic
difficulties.

<TEXT>
   On the 45th anniversary of the Allied victory in
Europe, U.S. and British leaders paid tribute today to American
soldier and statesman Dwight Eisenhower for his post-war vision of
a free and united Europe.
   ``He foresaw the unification of Germany and foresaw that we
should come to a stage when a divided Europe would be a thing of
the past. That is what we're working for now,'' said Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher.
   Vice President Dan Quayle, sitting across from Mrs. Thatcher in
the room where Britain's wartime leader Winston Churchill often met
with Eisenhower, said: ``He was a person of great vision and that
vision has come true today.''
   They spoke at a ceremony in the Cabinet Room at the prime
minister's 10 Downing Street residence marking the 100th birthday
of Eisenhower, the supreme commander of the Allied forces and later
president of the United States.
   Quayle credited Mrs. Thatcher and Presidents Bush and Reagan for
achieving Eisenhower's goal of ``peace and freedom'' in Europe.
   ``Now we must carry on with that victory,'' Quayle said. ``The
future is going to be one that presents many challenges. There is
no substitute for NATO. There is no substitute for peace and
freedom.''
   Mrs. Thatcher, sitting beside Churchill's grandson who bears the
former prime minister's name, said Eisenhower ``shared our dark
days and became an architect of our freedom. ... We counted him as
one of us.''
   In a speech Eisenhower made in Washington in 1953, Mrs. Thatcher
said, he saw the United States striving from the firm foundation of
NATO ``to foster a broader European community, conducive to the
free movement of persons, of trade and of ideas.''
   She said he foresaw ``a Europe that included a free and united
Germany, with a government based on a free and secret ballot.''
   She said he also envisioned this ``free community, and the full
independence of the East European nations, spelling the end of the
unnatural division of Europe.''
   Susan Eisenhower, who attended the ceremony with her Russian
husband, presented the prime minister with a pictorial history of
her grandfather's life. ``I am of the generation that remembers a
lot of it,'' Mrs. Thatcher said.
   Quayle arrived in London Monday night from Rome on the second
leg of a European tour commemorating Eisenhower. He flies to Paris
tonight.
   The vice president, who was a dinner guest Monday night at
Chequers, the prime minister's country residence, paid tribute to
the ``special relationship'' between Britain and the United States.
   That relationship has been a preoccupation of political
observers here as the focus of attention in Europe has shifted to
Germany.
   He also praised Mrs. Thatcher at a time when her popularity has
slumped and her Conservative Party is far behind the opposition
Labor Party in opinion polls. ``She continues to have a very
important special relationship with our president,'' Quayle said.

   An 82-year-old ex-convict is mentally unfit
to stand trial in the deaths of two sheriff's deputies who were
shot while giving him a ride in their patrol car, a prosecutor says.
   ``He can't understand the charges against him or assist in his
defense. If he is ever found competent to stand trial, we'll start
the trial process right away. He won't be freed,'' District
Attorney General Paul Summers said Monday.
   Ule Reynolds, a barber from Gary, Ind., is charged with shooting
the two Lauderdale County deputies in January. Authorities say the
deputies gave Reynolds a ride after finding him late at night in a
disabled car. He had been driving to Tennessee to attend a cousin's
funeral.
   Reynolds was armed with a .357-caliber Magnum revolver in a
shoulder holster, but deputies Bobby Nolen, 55, and Kevan Ward, 31,
apparently put him in the back seat of their car without searching
him for weapons, authorities say.
   Reynolds has a criminal record dating from 1927.
   Summers said doctors at the Middle Tennessee Mental Health
Institute in Nashville examined Reynolds and found him to be
senile. A circuit judge accepted that finding Friday and ruled
Reynolds incompetent to stand trial, Summers said.
   Prosecutors have asked that Reynolds be committed to a mental
institution and the court is expected to review his status next
month, Summers said. Reynolds has been in custody without bond
since his arrest.
   Relatives and friends told authorities that Reynolds' mental
ability has deteriorated in recent years. His wife, Minnie, said he
told her after the shooting that he thought the deputies were
taking him to jail.
   Reynolds was convicted of manslaughter in Tennessee in 1927 and
served a two- to five-year prison sentence. He had several arrests
on firearms charges over the years and was convicted in 1975 in
Indiana on a weapons violations and with trying to tamper with a
jury in a criminal case.

<HEAD>Prince Charles Warns East Europe of ``Ecological Armageddon''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's Prince Charles today praised
East Europeans for casting off communism but warned the region
faces an ``ecological Armageddon.''
   Speaking in the shadow of a statue of Karl Marx at a Budapest
university that until recently bore the name of the father of
communism, Charles was strident in his condemnation of Stalinism.
   ``In the name of Karl Marx, Lenin and Stalin charted a course
that divided Russia from Europe and then, after the Second World
War, forcibly removed Hungary from Western Europe, turning half of
Europe into a form of Marxist prison camp,'' he said during his
first visit to a Warsaw Pact country.
   Holding out hope that Russia ``may one day return to the west,''
Charles praised Hungary's role in the revolutions of 1989.
   ``One after another, the nations of Europe rejected an imposed
system which had repressed, impoverished and stultified them,
consistently failing to live up to its promises,'' he said.
   ``All of the re-emerging democracies of Europe owe Hungary a
debt,'' Charles said, noting that Hungary was the first Warsaw Pact
nation to break from the Iron Curtain.
   Hungary ``hammered the first hole in the Berlin Wall'' by
allowing thousands of East Germans to flee West last summer, and it
was a Hungarian pastor, Laszlo Toekes, whose persecution triggered
the revolt that brought down Romania's Nicolae Ceausescu, he said.
   Europeans can now ``reshape the moral and political future of
our continent,'' Charles said.
   But he warned the future is in danger from the grave ecological
damage wrought by developed industry in the West and centralized
planning in the East.
   ``Central Europe has itself been the victim of ideological
experiment and the worst follies of a command economy,'' said
Charles, who is known for his concern for the environment and
traditional architecture.
   ``Its very landscape bears the dreadful scars and so do its
children,'' he said. ``We are only just becoming aware of the
terrible catastrophe you have been suffering. Somehow we must find
a way to help reverse this apparent ecological Armageddon.''
   After his 30-minute speech, the keynote pronouncement of his
four-day visit to Hungary, Charles and his wife, Princess Diana,
moved to a nearby fruit and vegetable market to meet shoppers.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher toured the same market
when she visited Hungary in 1984.
   Britain's royal couple got an enthusiastic welcome from
Hungarian vendors and customers alike, chatting with those who
could speak English and admiring the rich assortment of traditional
salami and other produce.
   The princess, elegant in a pink suit with purple trim, won
universal admiration from the middle-aged Hungarian women straining
to catch a glimpse of her.
   ``She's beautiful,'' cooed Jolan Varga after the princess left
the market. Cries of ``Lady Di!'' rang out from children perched on
a staircase above the market floor.
   The royal couple, who arrived in Hungary late Monday, made
front-page news in all the national dailies today. State radio in
the early morning read extracts from Prince Charles' writings on
the ills of modern architecture.
   Later today, Charles was to meet Imre Makovecz, a Hungarian
architect well known for combining traditional motifs with his
modern designs.
   Diana attended a fashion show, and was later scheduled to visit
a movie set, where Hungarians are making a film about the
short-lived 1956 revolt crushed by Soviet troops.

<TEXT>
   Dr. Carroll Dean Henry Behrhorst, a teacher
at Tulane University who took medical care to poor, isolated
Guatemalans, died Monday in that Central American nation of an
apparent heart attack at the age of 67.
   Behrhorst, who founded the Behrhorst Clinic in Chimaltenango,
Guatemala, moved his family to that mountain town of about 20,000
people in 1962 after hearing that doctors were needed.
   Since 1982, he had taught nine months of each year at Tulane's
School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, where he was an
adjunct assistant professor. His specialty was providing health
care in underdeveloped countries.
   Behrhorst also taught at the medical school of the University of
San Carlos in Guatemala.
   Before moving to Guatemala, Behrhorst had a family medical
practice in Winfield, Kan.
   In Chimaltenango, he not only treated people but also set up a
program to teach villagers about health, nutrition, farming, child
care and family planning.
   The clinic that Dr. Behrhorst started as a one-man, one-room
operation evolved into a model rural hospital. The clinic also
established a safe water system for the village.
   Survivors include his wife, Alicia, four sons and five daughters.
   Burial will be in Chimaltenango.

<HEAD>IMF Committee Approves 50 Percent Quota Increase</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A 50 percent increase in money available for
loans to Eastern Europe and developing countries was approved today
by the International Monetary Fund's policy-making committee.
   At the insistence of the United States, the IMF's Interim
Committee linked the $60 billion increase to a plan to force
substantial economic reforms from 11 poor countries, which are $4
billion behind on their loan payments.
   U.S. officials said Congress had demanded the link before
approving the increase in the U.S. contribution, or quota.
   In exchange for the link, which many debtor countries opposed,
the United States agreed to begin consideration of an additional
increase in its contribution in 1993, two years earlier than
originally planned.
   ``Despite reservations that a number of members had on certain
individual elements of the package, we recognize this was a
consensus. ... Everybody had to give in order to achieve a
compromise,'' said Canadian Finance Minister Michael H. Wilson,
chairman of the 22-member Interim Committee.
   The quota change, which must be approved before the end of 1991
by nations representing 85 percent of the fund's voting power, will
raise the fund's resources to $180 billion from $120 billion.
   ``What you see ... is a package with features that are designed
to strengthen the role of the International Monetary Fund as the
central pillar of the international financial system,'' Wilson said.
   Delinquent countries that agree to adopt economic reforms would
be eligible for money from a special IMF fund. However, nations in
arrears could lose their voting rights. Also, the agency could sell
3 million ounces of gold, roughly equivalent to the members'
original contributions, to meet the obligations of defaulting
debtors.
   The 11 nations in arrears are the Sudan, Zambia, Peru, Costa
Rica, Honduras, Guyana, Somalia, Sierra Leone, Cambodia, Vietnam
and Panama.
   The Interim Committee also agreed to reorder the voting power
within the fund, allowing Japan to vault from fifth place to
second, behind the United States, in recognition of its growing
financial power. West Germany will share the second position.
   Offiials said Great Britain, which had been No. 2, and France
were close to an agreement to share the fourth spot, although that
was not addressed in the Interim Committee's statement.
   The panel reached agreeement on the package Monday night after
debating it most of the day in private sessions. It announced the
pact in a communique released this morning.
   The plan had received an important boost Sunday with the
endorsement by the Group of Seven major industrial nations: the
United States, Japan, West Germany, Great Britain, France, Canada
and Italy.
   On other subjects, the Interim Committee promised to support
reforms in Eastern European countries emerging from four decades of
communism, but not at the expense of developing countries. It
welcomed applications for fund membership from Czechoslovakia and
Bulgaria. Poland, Hungary, Yugoslavia and Romania are already
members.
   The panel also pointed to progress under Treasury Secretary
Nicholas F. Brady's 14-month-old program to reduce the crushing
$1.3 trillion debt burden on Third World countries, noting that
commercial banks have negotiated agreements with six countries:
Mexico, the Philippines, Costa Rica, Venezuela, Chile and Morocco.
   Commenting on recent economic developments, the committee noted
an upturn in inflation, saying, ``Recent price developments point
to the need for continued vigilance and restraint in monetary
policy.

   Federal prosecutors intend to seek additional
drug charges against Mayor Marion Barry, according to sources
familiar with the investigation.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Monday
that U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens wants a federal grand jury to
return up to five additional misdemeanor drug possession charges
against Barry.
   The legal action could come as early as today, the sources said.
   During a neighborhood walking tour today, Barry reacted to the
report, saying, ``I don't lose any sleep over allegations. Justice
is done in the courts. The best answer to a lie is the truth.''
   The mayor already faces five misdemeanor cocaine-possession
charges and three felony counts of lying to a federal grand jury
about his alleged drug use. Barry, arrested in an FBI sting
operation Jan. 18, has pleaded innocent to all eight counts
returned by a grand jury on Feb. 15.
   WRC-TV, also citing anonymous sources, reported Monday that the
new charges would relate to alleged drug use by the mayor in the
weeks before his January arrest.
   Judy Smith, a spokeswoman for Stephens, would not comment on the
possibility of new charges against the 54-year-old Barry.
   When Barry was indicted on Feb. 15, Stephens said he was
continuing to explore a ``broad range of allegations'' against the
mayor. The grand jury that indicted Barry has met regularly since
then, and several social companions of Barry's have testified
before the panel.
   Also, court papers filed on Monday reported that hair samples
taken from Barry on the night of his drug arrest showed that he had
used cocaine repeatedly in the preceding weeks.
   In the filing, Stephens opposed a move by Barry's lawyer to
suppress the hair test evidence.
   R. Kenneth Mundy, Barry's attorney, argued in an earlier filing
that because cocaine residue normally takes one to four days to
reach a suspect's hair follicles, tests taken in the hours
following Barry's Jan. 18 arrest would not be relevant to the case.
   The tests were administered after the mayor was arrested in a
downtown Washington hotel room by undercover FBI agents, who
officials say videotaped him smoking crack cocaine with a female
companion who was cooperating with authorities.
   Stephens argued that the tests should be admitted at Barry's
trial to help the government try to rebut any argument that the
mayor was coerced into using drugs.
   ``It is hard evidence based upon the concrete results of a
scientific test and it directly establishes that the defendant used
cocaine in the weeks immediately preceding his arrest,'' Stephens
wrote.
   In recent years, courts have increasingly relied on hair sample
tests for information on past drug use.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has scheduled a
pre-trial hearing for May 25 on various motions and counter-motions
filed by Mundy and Stephens. The trial is scheduled to begin June 4.

   An organization representing non-Latvian
workers today branded the Baltic republic's declaration of
independence a ``state coup'' and appealed for a protest strike.
   In the neighboring republic of Estonia, parliament took another
step toward independence by dropping the words ``Soviet Socialist''
from the republic's name and adopting the republic's old tricolor
flag in place of the red Soviet flag.
   And in the third Baltic republic, Lithuania sought to cope with
an economic blockade imposed by Moscow after its declaration of
independence by reducing meat supplies to the Soviet Union by 10
percent while it seeks alternative markets, a spokesman for
parliament said.
   The spokesman, Aidas Palubinskas, said the action was not a
retaliatory measure. He said the idea is to establish direct trade
with Soviet cities and regions, bypassing central authorities.
   ``Instead of using a worthless ruble, we'll be starting a market
economy on a small scale,'' he said.
   In Latvia, an appeal printed on the front page of the republic's
Communist Party newspaper said pro-independence leaders ``did not
consider it necessary to ask the people: do they want a return to
unemployment, lawlessness and oppression? Do they want hunger, cold
and bankruptcy as in neighboring Lithuania?''
   The appeal increased concern over how non-Latvians, who comprise
up 46 percent of the population and most of the urban working
class, would react to Friday's declaration of independence.
   Many non-Latvians oppose secession, especially the ethnic
Russians that make up 33 percent of the republic's 2.6 million
people.
   Latvia has pledged to go more slowly than neighboring Lithuania,
which declared itself a sovereign state on March 11.
   But it is unclear whether Latvia's gradual approach, which
includes honoring the Soviet Constitution for an unspecified
transition period, will save it from the sort of economic blockade
that Moscow imposed on Lithuania.
   In Estonia, parliament adopted several measures today intended
as a show of solidarity with Lithuania and Latvia, which have
declared full independence. The Soviet Union forcibly annexed all
three Baltic republics in 1940.
   The parliament, without formally declaring independence,
reinstituted several paragraph's from Estonia's 1938 constitution,
including an opening proclamation that Estonia is ``an independent
republic, with the supreme state power vested in the people.''
   The deputies also voted to drop the words ``Soviet Socialist''
from the republic's name and adopt the old Estonian blue, black and
white striped flag. Minutes after the vote was taken in the
Estoniana Supreme Soviet, the red Soviet flag with its hammer and
sickle was lowered from the roof of the parliament building and the
new flag was raised in its place.
   Nationalist parliamentarians regard the moves as another step in
a phased march toward independence and not in itself a formal break
with Moscow.
   Estonia last month declared its intention to restore
independence and called the Soviet Union an occupying power. But it
set no date for secession and left the door open for negotiations
with the Kremlin. Gorbachev has threatened Estonia, but taken no
concrete actions against it.
   In Latvia, the appeal for a protest strike, printed in
Sovietskaya Latvia, was from the republic's United Council of Work
Collectives, which members say represents about 140,000 workers.
Most of them are not ethnic Latvians.
   It calls the declaration of independence ``an anti-Soviet and
anti-constitutional state coup'' and said the decision was made
``in spite of the wishes of many work collectives and without a
general referendum, not taking into accont the opinion of a
significant number of people's deputies.''
   The appeal did not say when the strike should begin, but leaders
have previously mentioned May 15. It asked all enterprises in
Latvia to start organizing strike committees.
   Anatoly Alexeyev, head of the Interfront Movement that unites
thousand of non-Latvians, said today that he expected a major
anti-independence demonstration on Wednesday during Victory Day
celebrations marking the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II.
   Residents of Riga say they have already observed some panic
buying by people who fear Moscow will impose a partial economic
blockade, as it did against Lithuania.
   ``I don't know what's happened to everything _ now they have
grabbed up all the salt,'' said a retiree who was walking along the
streets of Riga's Old Town with an empty shopping bag.
   Latvian deputies awaited a response from Moscow to documents
they sent the Kremlin on Monday explaining their declaration of
independence and the transition period they envision.
   Deputy Prime Minister Ilmars Bisers, who helped draft the
message, said there had been no response yet and ``we may have to
go there.''
   In a speech to a group of veterans on Monday, Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev condemned ``separatists.'' But the Tass news
agency's report of that meeting did not say whether he mentioned
Latvia directly.
   ``There are forces that would like to use the atmosphere of
democracy, glasnost and freedom to implement their futile ambitious
plans, including separatist plans,'' he said.
   Such a policy was ``irresponsible,'' Gorbachev said.

   Mixing anger with grief, World Jewish
Congress leaders today honored the memory of the 6 million Jewish
victims of the Holocaust at the mansion where high-ranking Nazis
plotted their ``Final Solution.''
   ``I will not pray here, because I personally believe that God
turned his face away from this place, as he did from Auschwitz,''
said congress President Edgar M. Bronfman. ``Neverthless something
must be said.''
   In Hebrew, German and English, participants read words penned by
death camp survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel:
   ``What does a Jew today feel in this place, marked by evil and
malediction? Fear and trembling, anger _ incommensurate anger,
helplessness and grief, infinite grief.''
   The ceremony at the Wannsee Villa came on the final day of the
World Jewish Congress meeting in Berlin, the first time the
organization has met on German soil. Some delegates from around the
world stayed away from the meeting, saying the trip to the heart of
Nazi tyranny would be too traumatic.
   After the ceremony, the congress leaders went to East Berlin for
a meeting with East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere.
   ``There has never been a Germany without Jews,'' de Maiziere
told the Jewish leaders. ``There can only be a Germany with Jews,
or there won't be any Germany.
   ``Yet, the shadow of Auschwitz hangs over us,'' he continued.
   The democratically elected East German parliament, in a dramatic
gesture, last month accepted a share of responsibility for the
Holocaust. For more than four decades, the now-ousted Communist
authorities had denied any responsibility for the deaths of 6
million Jews.
   During his East Berlin visit, Bronfman urged that a memorial be
built at the site of the now crumbling Berlin Wall to recall the
dual significance of the date Nov. 9.
   On that day last year, the Berlin Wall was opened. On Nov. 9,
1938, Nazi thugs throughout Germany started ransacking Jewish
stores and homes and killing dozens of Jews in what has been called
Kristallnacht (Crystal Night), because of all the broken glass.
   The ceremony at the Wannsee Villa was held on the 45th
anniversary of the Nazis' unconditional surrender, ending World War
II in Europe.
   Under brilliant, sunny skies, the congress leaders gathered in
front of the villa, where on Jan. 20, 1942, high-ranking officials
of Adolf Hitler's Third Reich planned the extermination of the Jews.
   Wiesel's words called to mind some of the Jewish victims of the
Holocaust: ``teachers and their pupils, brides and grooms,
intellectuals and workers, rabbis and their disciples, young
revolutionaries and old dreamers of Zion.''
   Heather Harris, 23, read the statement in English before about
300 people, including the congress' leadership. Ms. Harris comes
from San Francisco and now lives in Jerusalem, where she heads the
World Union of Jewish Students.
   Heinz Galinski, head of West Germany's 35,000-member Jewish
community, recalled the horror that the Nazis planned at Wannsee.
   He said the murder of the Jews ``stands alone in the history of
mankind.''
   ``If the Nazis had won, then all the people of the world would
have been enslaved,'' said Galinski, like Wiesel a survivor of the
Auschwitz death camp.
   Before the ceremony, Bronfman and other leaders of the group
toured the inside of the villa, which is in disrepair. West Berlin
plans to turn it into a Holocaust memorial.
   They stood in what is known as the ``Fireplace Room,'' where
Nazi SS boss Reinhard Heydrich and his fellow Nazis planned the
``Final Solution.''
   ``It's mind-boggling,'' Bronfman said. ``I'm sad and I'm angry
too.''
   Introducing the statement by Wiesel, Bronfman called the Wannsee
decision ``the most despicable decision in the history of
mankind.'' Wiesel himself did not attend the ceremony because of
what were termed ``scheduling problems.''
   In the villa 48 years ago, Heydrich detailed plans to use Jews
as slave laborers and to build concentration camps, gas chambers
and crematoria. He said that a total of 11 million Jews would be
wiped out.
   Even before the Wannsee conference, Nazi troops had been
slaughtering Jews in occupied Polish and Soviet territory.
   Outside the villa's high gates, a plaque reads: ``In this house
in January 1942, the infamous Wannsee conference took place. To the
memory of the fellow human beings slain by the Nazi tyranny.''
   At a news conference Monday at the heavily guarded West Berlin
Jewish Community headquarters, the Jewish congress leaders
discussed their concerns about German reunification.
   ``The Jewish people have something to say to the new Germany
that is going to be created in a short time,'' Bronfman said.
   He said Sunday that a unified Germany must ``forever teach''
about the Nazi Holocaust, ``the lowest point ever reached in man's
inhumanity to man.''
   In Jerusalem, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said it was Israel's
duty to demand that ``in a united Germany there would be a
perpetual educational effort, so that the generation growing up
there would remember. In all parts of Germany, the government must
wage a war against anti-Semitism.''
   The Polish-born Shamir escaped the Holocaust, but his parents
and two sisters were killed.
   Of the more than 600 participants at the meeting, 80 were from
nations other than Germany.

<HEAD>Canadian Deportees Sometimes Forcibly Sedated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deportees from Canada are sometimes forcibly
sedated before being expelled to protect other travelers, the
Canadian immigration minister said.
   Any deportee leaving Canada by plane, train, bus or boat who
might be disruptive on the trip is liable to be drugged,
Immigration Minister Barbara McDougall said Monday.
   ``In some cases we provide a medical attendant for some people
who are being deported. Should there be any sedation, that is done
by the medical attendant,'' she told reporters.
   She said under international agreements concerning airlines,
``we have to make sure people's behavior on an aircraft is
appropriate and there's no danger to other passengers.''
   The practice is ``not a violation of anything as far as I can
tell,'' she said.
   But Steve Foster, a lawyer with the Jesuit Refugee Service in
Toronto, said the government is abusing the rights of deportees by
drugging them without consent.
   ``We've got a charter of rights that says you can't do this to
people,'' Foster said in a telephone interview. ``To administer
drugs for a non-medical reason is unethical. To administer drugs
without a patient's consent is unethical.''
   In the United States, the Immigration and Naturalization Service
does not, ``as a matter of policy sedate deportable aliens,'' but
INS officers accompany ``anyone that might be potentially violent
or dangerous,'' spokesman Duke Austin said in Washington.
   On chartered flights, however, deportees have been sedated ``on
a limited basis'' by the INS, said a source, who spoke on condition
of anonymity. The INS has used chartered flights or government
planes to deport Cubans to their homeland.
   McDougall's comments about forced sedations came after
questioning from Canadian member of parliament Dan Heap, who asked
McDougall to halt the deportation of Mohammed Ahmed Said, a Kenyan.
   ``I don't believe there's anything in Canadian law which allows
me to put a needle in you without your permission no matter what,
unless you're mentally incompetent,'' Heap said outside the House
of Commons.
   Said claims immigration officers threatened to sedate him if he
made any trouble, Heap said.
   Said was being held in a detention center in Toronto pending
deportation, which McDougall said she would not halt.

   President Bush sent letters
congratulating Nelson Mandela and South African President F.W. de
Klerk on their historic talks last week, their offices said today.
   The African National Congress, the most powerful black political
organization in South Africa, released the contents of the letter
it said was received today. De Klerk's office confirmed he had also
received a letter from Bush, but did not make the contents public.
   ``Your brave struggle against apartheid and your commitment to
peace and a political solution to South Africa's great problems
have stirred the hopes of many,'' Bush said to Mandela, deputy
president of the ANC.
   ``The American people respect this commitment and support your
efforts to achieve a non-racial and democratic South Africa with
equal opportunity for all,'' Bush said.
   The letter said the great energy shown by Mandela since de Klerk
freed him from a life prison sentence in February had helped the
country move closer to achieving those objectives.
   ``The joint commitment to a peaceful process of negotiations and
efforts to resolve the existing climate of violence agreed to by
the African National Congress and the government is a great step
forward to this end,'' Bush said, adding he looked forward to
discussing those issues with Mandela when they meet later this year.

   Existing home sales declined 1.6 percent
during the first quarter, a real estate trade group said today, as
mortgage rates anchored themselves in double-digits and prices in
many areas continued to rise.
   The National Association of Realtors said sales totaled a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.81 million units during the
January-March period, down from 3.87 million units during the
fourth quarter and 3.90 million during the first quarter of 1989.
   At the same time, the Realtors survey showed the median price of
existing homes rose 5.2 percent to $95,900, up from $91,200 during
the same period of 1989. The median price means half of the homes
cost more, half less.
   Mortgage rates moved up as well, ranging from 9.83 percent as
the year began to 10.22 percent as the quarter ended, according to
the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Association.
   The survey covered sales of existing single-family detached
homes, town houses, apartment condominiums and cooperatives.
   The Realtors said sales are expected to remain stable during the
year.
   The survey showed 29 states with increased sales, led by South
Dakota with a 49.1 percent gain, while Vermont was at the bottom of
the list with a 24.8 percent decline.
   By region, the West posted a 3.0 percent sales increase to an
annual rate of 680,000 units, followed by the South, up 0.7 percent
to 1.46 million units.
   The Northeast has the largest decline, down 5.5 percent to
690,000 units. Sales were down 4.9 percent in the Midwest to
980,000 units.
   The West also experienced the sharpest gain in median prices, up
7.6 percent to $143,700. It was followed by the Midwest where costs
rose 6.9 percent to $74,200.
   Prices advanced 2.0 percent each in the Northeast and South. The
median price in the Northeast was $146,200, while it was $85,800 in
the South.
   Five Western metropolitan areas continued to have the most
expensive homes, led by Honolulu with a median price of $290,400.
It was followed by the San Francisco Bay area, $262,200; Orange
County, Calif., $243,600; Los Angeles, $211,500, and San Diego,
$182,300. San Diego was tied with Boston.
   The least expensive homes were found in Peoria, Ill., where the
median price was $48,000; Oklahoma City, $50,600; Spokane, Wash.,
$52,000; Mobile, Ala., $58,700, Louisville, Ky., $59,300.

   A car packed with dynamite exploded
today outside a government office building in western Colombia,
killing one person and wounding five others, police said.
   The blast damaged the civil register's offices, along with
several houses, stores and vehicles in Pereira, a city of 300,000
residents about 110 miles west of Bogota. No one claimed
responsibility, but police said they captured one suspect who they
believed had driven the car to the site.
   An army communique also reported today that 18 leftist guerillas
and a soldier died in three battles Monday in different regions. It
said the rebels belonged to the country's three main guerrilla
groups _ the National Liberation Army, the People's Liberation Army
and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.
   And in the latest terrifying twist in the drug war, a top police
official said Monday that traffickers are buying up homes near
police stations, intent on turning them into house bombs.
   ``The traffickers are willing to pay five or six times the value
of the houses in order to fill them with dynamite and blow them
up,'' said Col. Oscar Pelaez, chief of the country's investigative
police.
   He told a news conference Monday that some of the homes involved
are adjacent his agency's headquarters in southern Bogota.
   Drug traffickers have been carrying out a terrorist campaign of
car bombings and other attacks in retaliation for a government
crackdown on drugs. Authorities blame traffickers for the
assassinations of three presidential candidates in the last eight
months.
   The Medellin cocaine cartel has targeted police in particular.
Most of the violence has been in the city of Medellin, where more
than 30 police officers and several civilians have been killed the
last two months. On Saturday, Medellin police defused an abandoned
car packed with dynamite and ball-bearings.
   The drug lords have said in communiques that they are
retaliating for alleged police torture and killing of detained
cartel members. At Monday's news conference, the chief of police,
Gen. Miguel Gomez, repeated an official denial of those charges.
   Pelaez said police were tipped off to the house-bomb plot by
informers in the cartel. He said indiscriminate violence by the
cartel had disenchanted some members.
   ``Many people are ready to collaborate in a common crime,''
Pelaez said in an interview after the news conference. ``They are
willing to kill an individual. But when it comes to these
collective massacres, they are sickened and they denounce the
actions.''
   He said police also had received cooperation from private
citizens who live near houses that traffickers tried to buy.
   ``The people realize that their lives are threatened,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, authorities found the bodies of 13 people who they
said had been massacred in southern Guaviare state.
   The state's governor, Wilfredo Ceron, said the killings had
taken place Friday in dense jungle that prevented immediate
confirmation. He told the RCN radio network the killings were
apparently the result of a private feud.

   The lead prosecutor at John M. Poindexter's
Iran-Contra coverup trial says he had ample evidence for telling
jurors that President Reagan lied to the American people about
trading arms for hostages.
   Dan K. Webb said in a court filing that his remark, made during
final arguments, was supported by evidence that Reagan had, indeed,
sold arms to Iran to try to secure the release of American hostages
in Lebanon.
   Webb defended his comment in a brief that he and other trial
prosecutors filed Monday in response to Poindexter's motion to set
aside his five felony convictions.
   The former national security adviser was convicted April 7 of
conspiracy, obstructing congressional inquiries and making false
statements to Congress about the Iran-Contra affair.
   In his summation to the jury, Webb said he couldn't criticize
Reagan's decision to sell arms to Iran in an attempt to win the
hostages' freedom.
   ``You make judgments as president and you carry them out, and
maybe you're right and maybe you're wrong,'' Webb said. ``But you
don't lie to the American public.''
   The defense had previously charged that Webb's statement about
Reagan was an improper expression of personal opinion that was
``clearly designed to inflame the members of the jury, to make them
feel as if they themselves were victims of the alleged crime in
this case.''
   The prosecution responded Monday by saying Webb's statements
were ``fully supported by the evidence and were relevant to the
charges in this case.''
   The evidence ``clearly established'' that a November 1985
shipment of Hawk anti-aircraft missiles to Iran ``was intended as
part of an exchange of arms for hostages,'' said the brief filed by
prosecutors in the office of independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh.
   ``The evidence further establishes that on Nov. 13, 1986,
President Reagan addressed the nation and denied to the American
public the allegation that his administration had been involved in
an arms-for-hostages deal,'' the prosecution filing said.
   Webb's comment was relevant because prosecutors were trying to
show that Poindexter's motive for lying to lawmakers about the U.S.
role in the missile shipment to Iran was to protect the president
from political embarrassment.
   Poindexter, questioned by lawmakers within days of Reagan's
speech, denied he knew anything about the shipment at the time it
occurred.
   Poindexter also was convicted of lying to Congress by denying
that National Security Council staff officer Oliver L. North was
supervising a secret operation to arm the Nicaraguan rebels after
Congress banned U.S. military aid.
   He is scheduled to be sentenced June 11 and could receive up to
25 years in prison and fined as much as $1.25 million.

   Anti-Communist protesters stormed out
of a meeting with Interim President Ion Iliescu today, dashing
government hopes of a quick end to a marathon rally demanding his
resignation.
   The meeting ended just minutes after it began when the
government said the session could not be videotaped and the
protesters' delegation refused a counter-offer of a stenographer
recording the minutes.
   At downtown University Square, site of the anti-Iliescu protest,
about 1,000 demonstrators had gathered by midday, loudly demanding
Iliescu's resignation. They called his National Salvation Front,
which dominates the interim government, a party of
``neo-Communists.''
   The demonstrators, part of a rally that began 17 days ago, vowed
to continue their protest until Romania's first free national
elections in more than 50 years are held May 20.
   Iliescu, a former Communist Party functionary, was relegated to
lesser duties when he became an outspoken critic of former dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu in the early 1970s.
   The Front was catapulted to prominence after Ceausescu was
toppled in December. Iliescu and other former Communist officials
within the Front publicly broke with their Marxist past and
embraced democratic, free-market ideals. But critics accuse them of
adhering to Communist ideals and seeking to reimpose totalitarian
rule if they win the elections.
   Meanwhile, the National Liberal Party said its presidential
candidate, Radu Campeanu, had canceled planned campaign stops in
the northeastern region of Moldavia after being attacked Saturday
by alleged Front supporters in Braila, 180 miles northeast of
Bucharest.
   Liberal Party officials said Campeanu, who suffered facial cuts
in the attack, was considering whether to cancel two other planned
rallies out of concern for his safety.
   Both Campeanu and Ion Ratiu, candidate of the National Peasants'
Party, recently have said they would boycott the balloting unless
political violence by alleged Front supporters abated. Ratiu and
his wife have claimed they also have been the targets of Front
assaults.

   Rural Texans stubbornly stayed by their homes as
the Trinity River _ swollen from the worst northern Texas flooding
in more than 80 years _ rolled southward toward the Gulf of Mexico
today.
   Elsewhere, a reservoir on the Oklahoma line began falling after
hitting a record of more than 27 feet above normal, and snakebites
were on the rise in Arkansas, where flooding has forced the
evacuation of more than 300 homes and driven the reptiles from
nesting areas.
   The Arkansas River hit a record 27.6 feet _ 3.6 feet above flood
stage _ today at Little Rock.
   Thirteen deaths have been blamed on the weather in the past two
weeks, one in Oklahoma and the rest in Texas.
   Northern Texas has had 22.06 inches of rainfall in the first
four months of 1990, the most since 1922. The result: the worst
flooding since 1908.
   Light rain fell today in eastern Texas and there was a chance of
thunderstorms in the Dallas area Wednesday, but National Weather
Service meteorologist John Cockrell said that should not compound
the already severe flooding.
   In Texas, flood warnings for people and livestock were issued
for today as the Trinity River engulfed homes, pastures and fields
south of Dallas.
   At least 150 people were evacuated and main roads closed in
Trinidad, 60 miles southeast of Dallas. Near Palestine, 90 miles
below Dallas, about 50 homes were destroyed or severely damaged in
the community of Long Lake, where the Trinity, usually a few
hundred feet across, had bulged to about two miles.
   ``We can't tell exactly how many residences are affected yet,
because we can't count underwater,'' said Bill Walters, manager of
a Red Cross shelter set up in a campground.
   While about 80 people had been evacuated from Long Lake by late
Monday, many were reluctant to leave, Walters said. ``These people
are pretty stubborn, as all Texans are. They think they can stick
it out, but they really can't do it,'' he said.
   As the flooding moved downstream, the Red Cross sent teams to
prepare shelters. Many farm-to-market roads and some major highways
were closed.
   Lake Texoma on the Oklahoma line fell half a foot Monday after
cresting at a record 644.76 feet above sea level, the first time
since 1957 that water flowed out the spillways.
   Mike McCoy of the Army Corps of Engineers said will take up to
two months for the lake to return to a ``decent'' level as the
Corps plans to lower i by 6 to 9 inches a day.
   A preliminary survey Sunday found 83 homes at least partially
submerged in Oklahoma's Marshall County, which is partly cut off
from the outside by the swollen lake.
   Highway flooding made life strange for Judy Peterson, who works
in Madill, Okla.
   Instead of simply driving the 18 miles from her home on Sand
Point to the office, she and her husband must take a boat a
half-mile and then drive a circuitous 56-mile route around the
northern edge of Lake Texoma and back to Madill. They'd been doing
that for a week as of Monday.
   ``It's really getting old,'' she said.
   In central Arkansas, the rising waters of the Arkansas River
have driven snakes from their homes. A hospital at Pine Bluff,
which normally treats one snakbite victim a week, has treated eight
in the last week. Spokesman Bill Cheatham said most were bitten by
copperheads, but no one was seriously hurt.
   Water was reported up to 3{ feet deep in homes in the Pine Bluff
area.
   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton added two more counties to last
week's disaster declaration Monday, bringing the total to 29. An
estimated 325 houses were evacuated in six counties, officials said.
   Officials said the flooding along the Arkansas River was the
worst since a 1927 rampage that prompted construction of many of
the levees along the river.

   Former West Virginia Gov. Arch Moore
today fulfilled an agreement with federal prosecutors by pleading
guilty to a five-count corruption indictment.
   The maverick Republican, the only West Virginia governor to
serve three four-year terms, entered his plea before U.S. District
Judge Walter Hoffman, brought in from Baltimore because federal
judges in the state asked to be excused.
   Moore faces up to 36 years in prison and fines totaling $1.2
million. Sentencing was set for July 10. U.S. Attorney Michael
Carey said the government agreed to make no sentencing
recommendation.
   Moore, 67, agreed April 12 to plead guilty to extortion, mail
fraud, tax fraud and obstruction of justice after federal
prosecutors revealed they had secretly recorded a meeting in which
Moore allegedly admitted receiving illegal cash donations in his
1988 campaign. The recording also allegedly showed he planned to
hide information from federal investigators.
   After the hearing, Carey said additional allegations against
Moore will be detailed at the sentencing hearing.
   ``Mr. Moore use large sums outside the election process. It was
a scheme to run the election outside the limit of the law,'' said
John Campbell, an assistant U.S. attorney from the Justice
Department's public integrity section.
   ``Any time the franchise of the voters is taken away from them
is a serious offense,'' Carey said.
   The indictment accused Moore of committing acts relating to his
1984 campaign and his term as governor from 1985 to 1989.
   In addition, Moore was accused of blocking a federal grand
jury's investigation of him last year and this year, Carey said.
   The indictment further alleged Moore used his public position to
extort approximately $573,000 in 1985, Carey said. It also accused
him of filing false income tax returns in 1984 and 1985, the
official said.
   It further charged that he schemed to defraud the state of his
salary and benefits by funneling about $100,000 in cash into his
1984 campaign fund, Carey said.
   It was the second time Moore was indicted for improprieties
allegedly committed while in office. He and his 1972 campaign
manager were indicted in December 1975 for allegedly extorting
$25,000 from the president of a shaky financial holding company
trying to get a state charter for a new bank. Moore was acquitted
in 1976.
   Although registered as a Republican, Moore's politics were
flexible in a state in which Democrats outnumber Republicans
2-to-1. He had friends and foes on both sides of the aisle.
   Moore served one term in the state House of Delegates from 1953
to 1954 and was in the U.S. House from 1957 to 1969.
   He won the governor's office in 1968 with a razor-thin election
victory, and defied polls four years later to win re-election.
   The constitution barred him from a third consecutive term, but
in 1984 he returned for a third, nonconsecutive term.
   Budget problems helped undo him in 1988, when voters turned him
out in favor of political novice Gaston Caperton.
   He is the second West Virginia governor to encounter legal
trouble with the federal government.
   Former Democratic Gov. W.W. ``Wally'' Barron, who served from
1961-65, and several of his associates were tried on bribery
conspiracy charges in 1968. Barron was acquitted but later went to
prison for bribing the foreman of the jury that acquitted him.

<HEAD>Communists Suffer Sharp Setback In Local Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italian voters dealt the new-look Communist Party a
sharp setback in regional and provincial elections, while groups
seeking greater local autonomy made surprising gains, according to
results released today.
   ``Earthquake at the polls,'' said the national daily La
Repubblica after the Lega Lombarda, a regional political party in
the Milan area, won 19 percent of the votes, outpolling the
Communists in the wealthy industrial region.
   Results from the voting Sunday and Monday confirmed the early
trends showing the Communists, who had come to the brink of power a
decade ago, getting no more than 24 percent of the vote.
   The Communists, Italy's No. 2 party, won 30 percent of the vote
in the last regional elections in 1985 and 27.8 percent in
parliamentary voting in 1987.
   The Christian Democrats, who have led or dominated all national
governments for four decades, suffered small losses and held on to
about a third of the total votes.
   The Socialists, Italy's No. 3 party, advanced, but with 15
percent of the vote were still a long way from overtaking the
Communists.
   Premier Giulio Andreotti, a Christian Democrat, warned during
the campaign that major shifts in the voting could cause his
coalition government to collapse. The coalition also includes the
Socialists and three tiny parties: Republicans, Social Democrats
and Liberals.
   But commentators said the results didn't appear to pose major
risks for the coalition.
   However, the results were a disappointment for the Communists,
who adopted a ``new course'' at an extraordinary congress in March
in an effort to halt the party's steady electoral decline since the
early 1980s and react to the democratic upheavals sweeping
Communist parties from power in Eastern Europe.
   At their congress, the Communists gave party leader Achille
Occhetto a mandate to restructure the party to try to unite Italy's
fractured left. This would eventually entail changing the party's
name and hammer-and-sickle symbol.
   The proposals were opposed by the party's old guard leaders, who
saw them as a denial of the party's history and roots.
   ``The new course didn't stop the hemorrhage of votes that has
gone on since 1984,'' said the leading Milan newspaper Corriere
della Sera.
   The biggest gains were made by the Lega Lombarda and similar
locally oriented groups in the north.
   These groups have been accused of prejudice toward Italians from
the south and immigrants from the Third World who have come to the
more prosperous north seeking work.
   But the Lega has denied the charge, saying its aim is to reduce
the power of the central government in local matters.
   ``The racist leagues advance,'' headlined Rome's Il Messaggero.
   But Giorgio Bocca, a La Repubblica columnist, said the
mainstream parties would be making a serious error to underplay the
reasons for the success of the new groups.
   ``This is the reaction to a policy which has led to the
bankruptcy of the public administration and handed large areas of
the south to the underworld,'' Bocca wrote.
   Umberto Bossi, leader of the Lega Lombarda, said its success in
becoming the second-largest party in Lombardy exceeded its
expectations.
   ``This is the first step toward our final goal of federalism, to
reduce the power of the central government.''
   Up for election were 15 of 20 regional governments, 87
provincial governing councils and 6,374 city governments. City
elections were not held in such major centers as Rome, Naples,
Trieste, Catania and Bolzano.

   A man told police he was burned, tortured by
electric shocks, put on a hot stove and had hot wax poured into his
eyes after he and another man were abducted in a drug deal that
went sour, police said today.
   Paul Breakwell, 20, said he and Jason Ingani, 19, both of
Monroeville, were held by three men and assaulted for more than
eight hours after the alleged deal broke down, Police Chief Donald
Aubrecht said.
   Breakwell told police he was burned, shocked with electricity
and put on a hot stove before he escaped and summoned police
Saturday; the men said they caught Breakwell and Ingani trying to
burglarize the house, Aubrecht said.
   John Bosack, 20, and John Fritzius, 21, who both lived in the
home where the alleged assaults occurred, and Brian Teets, 19, of
Monroeville were charged with unlawful restraint, terroristic
threats, aggravated assault, reckless endangerment and drug
possession, Aubrecht said.
   Police confiscated what appeared to be cocaine, along with
pills, drug paraphernalia and $1,200 in cash.
   Breakwell was being treated at Forbes Regional Medical Center,
but his family requested no information be released, hospital
officials said. Ingani also was hospitalized after the abduction,
but his whereabouts weren't known.
   The hospitalized men face drug charges when their hospital
treatment is finished, Aubrecht said. They also could be charged
with burglary if Bosack and Fritzius file a countercomplaint.
   Fritzius and Teets were released on $10,000 bond each. Bosack is
being held in the Allegheny County Jail on $10,000 bond. The three
men are scheduled to appear at a hearing Thursday.

<HEAD>Chaos in Gas Supplies Costs Job of Oil Company Director</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Ministry of Industry has dismissed the
director of the state-run oil monopoly, blaming him for a
disruption in supplies that has led to long lines at gas stations,
a ministry spokesman said today.
   Jerzy Szewczyk was fired from his post as director of the
Central Oil Company for failing to predict a need to increase crude
oil imports, said the spokesman, Jan Golab.
   For the last week, gas stations across Poland have been plagued
by long lines reminiscent of the chronic shortages during the
former Communist regime when gasoline had to be rationed.
   The lines dwindled after the market-oriented policies of the new
Solidarity-led government reduced demand by raising gasoline prices
dramatically to match world market prices more closely.
   Golab said that due to a shortage of funds, Szewczyk had kept a
relatively low supply of gas in Poland and had not anticipated
increased purchases last week as a result of two national holidays.
   Supplies to gas stations dried up, causing long lines to appear
and requiring rapid imports, Golab said.
   The failure of the Soviet Union to meet its obligations in crude
oil deliveries has also contributed to the disruption of gas
supplies.
   Some Soviet gasoline bound for Poland is refined in Lithuania.
Moscow has sharply reduced oil supplies to the Baltic republic as
part of an economic blockade aimed at forcing the Lithuanians to
back off their declaration of independence.
   The offical PAP news agency reported that deliveries from the
Soviet Union dropped by 10,000 tons in April as a result of
``general problems in its economy and trade with Poland.''
   Polish newspapers reported today that the situation is likely to
improve in the short term because tankers with foreign oil were
either already docked or on their way to the Baltic port of Gdansk.

<HEAD>Spain Deports Palestinians Who Planned Bombing of Syrian Embassy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spain has pardoned and deported two
Lebanese Palestinian terrorists arrested in 1985 while preparing a
car-bomb attack on the Syrian Embassy in Madrid, a Justice Ministry
spokeswoman said Tuesday.
   The government approved a pardon April 20 for Jihad Ibrahim
Salami and Chassan Ibrahim. They were deported to Lebanon
immediately afterward, said the spokeswoman, who was not identified
in accordance with custom.
   The daily El Pais said Tuesday the pardons coincided with others
granted recently in several Western countries. The newspaper did
not identify the countries. It said the pardons were intended as
goodwill gestures in response to the recent release of Western
hostages held by radical groups in Lebanon.
   It was the second time since 1986 the government has pardoned
and deported Lebanese citizens convicted of terrorist acts in Spain.
   The two men pardoned last month were arrested in July 1985 in a
Madrid apartment where police found 26 of explosives.
   The Palestinians told police they planned to use a car bomb to
blow up the Syrian Embassy in Madrid and assassinate the Syrian
ambassador.
   Police said at the time they believed the men were members of
Force 17, part of PLO leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah organization.
   Force 17 served originally as a special security group to
protect Arafat and other senior PLO leaders. It later took up
special operations against Israeli targets.
   In 1987, a court convicted both men on charges of illegal
possession of arms, explosives and false identification papers and
sentenced each to 10 years in prison.

<HEAD>Angolan Rebels Claim Field Victory, Reports Fighting Closes on
Luanda</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angola's U.S.-backed rebels today
claimed they had routed government forces after a three-day battle
in southeast Angola, while Portuguese media reports said fighting
could be closing on the capital Luanda.
   A statement released in the Portuguese capital said 139
government troopers were killed and remaining government forces
fled trenches near Mavinga, 700 miles southeast of Luanda.
   The Portuguese news agency Lusa reported from Luanda that Gen.
Antonio dos Santos N'dalu was nominated to command the Bengo-Cuanza
front, indicating fighting was as close as 38 miles northeast of
the capital.
   There was no confirmation from officials in Luanda that fighting
was so close to the capital.
   Government troops launched an offensive last December against
UNITA rebel positions in southeast Cuando Cubango province and
claimed they captured the airstrip and a strategic UNITA base near
Mavinga.
   In turn, the rebels stepped up bombing and sabotage attacks in
the capital and other towns.
   UNITA never acknowledged defeat at Mavinga, and today's
statement, signed by Chief of Staff Arlindo Pena, said recent
fighting drove government troops from positions six miles north of
the base.
   But Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos said last week
government columns had advanced south of Mavinga and could soon be
within artillery range of rebel headquarters at Jamba, some 125
miles further south.
   A Western diplomat following the Angolan conflict from Lisbon
said today the UNITA claims seemed ``exaggerated,'' adding he had
no reports of a major battle in the region.
   Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said any government
withdrawal from Mavinga could be to reinforce units in the north,
where UNITA rebels are said to have intensified offensives in small
combat units.
   The reports of fighting came as diplomatic efforts continued to
reach a peaceful end to the 15-year civil war.
   UNITA, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola,
has been fighting to force the Marxist Angolan government to share
power since the country gained independence from Portugal in 1975.

   The accused ringleader in the Bensonhurst attack
gathered a white gang armed with bats because he believed blacks
were coming into their neighborhood to attack them, his attorney
argued today.
   ``You might convict him of being a jerk. He is a jerk,'' Stephen
Murphy, attorney for Keith Mondello, said in his closing statement.
``But it's no crime to be a jerk.''
   Meanwhile, a separate jury deciding the fate of the accused
triggerman, Joseph Fama, resumed deliberating today. They asked to
review several pieces of evidence, including photographs of the
mostly white Bensonhurst neighborhood of Brooklyn and a photo
collage containing pictures of the defendants.
   The jurors began deciding Fama's fate Monday without hearing
that a key witness with a history of hallucinations wanted to
recant.
   State Supreme Court Justice Thaddeus Owens refused to let Fama's
defense lawyer reopen his case to put Franklin Tighe back on the
witness stand to say he did not see the shooting.
   Tighe, 20, also a Bensonhurst resident, has a long record of
psychological problems including visual hallucinations and severe
depression. He was the only witness who said he saw Fama pull a
pistol and shoot 16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins.
   Defense lawyer David DePetris said Monday that after testifying,
Tighe contacted him and said he was not standing next to Fama when
Hawkins was shot, as he told the jury.
   ``In plain, simple language, I smell a rat here,'' Assistant
District Attorney Edward Boyar said. He objected to allowing
DePetris to reopen his case, which he rested last week.
   In his summation Monday in Fama's case, Boyar was highly
critical of ``silent Bensonhurst'' and its numerous residents who
saw much or all of the Aug. 23 attack but refused to come forward.
   He spoke of door stoops ``where the brother and sisterhood of
Bensonhurst sat, watching but not seeing, hearing but not
listening'' when Hawkins was surrounded by a white mob and shot
through the heart.
   ``When the mob turned that corner what did they know about Yusuf
Hawkins?'' Boyar asked. ``They knew the color of his skin. That was
the only thing they knew about Yusuf Hawkins.''
   DePetris told the jury the prosecution witnesses were not
believable and that Fama had not been proved guilty.
   He told the panel that Tighe believed what he was saying when he
testified. But he said the stress of finding Hawkins dying on the
street triggered hallucinations in the mentally unstable man.

Elizeth Cardoso, who in her heyday was known as ``The Divine,'' has
died of stomach cancer. She was 69.
   Ms. Cardoso died Monday at the Bambina medical center in Rio de
Janeiro, a clinic spokesman said.
   Ms. Cardoso's career spanned 50 years. She started out as a
singer in small clubs, and with the release in 1958 of ``Song of
Too Much Love,'' her career took off. She recorded more than 60
records, the last in 1989.
   Composer Dorival Caymmi said Ms. Cardoso's death represented a

<HEAD>Fashion Revolutionary of Britain's Swinging Sixties Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alexander Plunket Greene, who with his wife Mary
Quant helped revolutionize the British fashion scene for young
people in the 1960s, has died, his family announced.
   He died Friday at age 57, his family reported Monday. No cause
of death was stated.
   Plunket Greene and Mary Quant met when they were both students
at Goldsmiths' College of Art in southeast London, and they married
in 1957.
   In 1955, Plunket Greene and a friend, Archie McNair, had opened
a fashion boutique called Bazaar in the King's Road in west
London's Chelsea district.
   Quant was initially the buyer for Bazaar. But with her husband's
encouragement, she began to sell her own trend-setting designs.
   These included the miniskirt that became the symbol of Britain's
swinging sixties.
   The influence of the couple turned the King's Road into the
fashion mecca for young Britons.
   Crowded with clothes boutiques and chic restaurants, its
sidewalks became a perpetual fashion show as young people flocked
there to buy the latest styles and be seen wearing them. The styles
were widely copied abroad.
   Bazaar became one of the first stores to cater almost
exclusively to the new generation of affluent young.
   The couple opened a second store in the nearby Knightsbridge
district of London in 1961, and Plunket Greene opened a restaurant
in the basement of the original King's Road store.
   Tall, witty, elegant and sociable, Plunket Greene in 1963
expanded into the mass market with a new Mary Quant label, Ginger
Group, and launched his wife's designs with considerable success in
the United States.
   During the 1970s, he expanded the Mary Quant licences to include
items such as bed linens, carpets, swim wear, hosiery and jewelry
and secured a place in the Japanese market.
   He is survived by his wife and their 19-year-old son, Orlando.

<TEXT>
   Ohio Rep. Donald ``Buz'' Lukens asked voters to salvage his
scandal-marred career and four North Carolina Democrats fought for
a chance to challenge Sen. Jesse Helms, as five states held primary
elections today.
   West Virginia's Democratic ballot featured Sen. Jay
Rockefeller's shoo-in bid for nomination to a second term, and a
campaign for state treasurer by Dee Caperton, whose divorce from
Gov. Gaston Caperton last fall made headlines.
   The other states with balloting are Indiana, which has
congressional primaries, and New Jersey, where impoverished
Atlantic City and several other communities are choosing mayors.
   Senate candidate Harvey Gantt, the former mayor of Charlotte,
N.C., was joined at the polls this morning by two first-time voters
he could count on for support, his daughters Erika, 19, and Angela,
18.
   Here is a state-by-state rundown of the liveliest races:
   _ OHIO: Lukens, who represents a conservative, rural district in
western Ohio, was disowned by the Republican Party after his
conviction last year on a misdemeanor charge of having sex with a
16-year-old girl. The 59-year-old divorced Lukens says his actions
were ``dumb'' but ``not evil.'' Over the weekend, The Columbus
Dispatch reported the state Tax Department had certified him as
delinquent because of $1,500 in unpaid personal income taxes.
   The leader among his three primary opponents is Thomas Kindness,
who formerly held the seat. Three Democrats seek their party's
nomination.
   Ohio also has a governor's race, with state Attorney General
Anthony J. Celebrezze Jr. facing one little-known opponent for the
Democratic nomination. George Voinovich, the former Cleveland
mayor, is unopposed for GOP nomination.
   In Cuyahoga County, voters decide whether to raise taxes on
liquor and cigarettes to finance a new stadium for baseball's
Cleveland Indians.
   _ NORTH CAROLINA: Gantt, Charlotte's first black mayor, has
emerged in recent polls as the front-runner in the Democratic
Senate primary but appears unlikely to avoid a runoff by winning
more than 40 percent of the vote.
   ``We are not going to win this World Series by dividing
ourselves up in the league championship,'' Gantt said over the
weekend in appealing to voters to unite behind him as the best hope
of beating Helms.
   The three other leading candidates in a six-man field are John
Ingram, a former state insurance commissioner; Michael Easley, the
Brunswick County district attorney, and R.P. ``Bo'' Thomas, a
former state senator.
   Helms himself faces two token challengers in the GOP primary.
   In the 3rd District, 100-year-old Henry Merritt Stenhouse, an
eye doctor, is running in a GOP primary for the seat held by
Democratic Rep. Martin Lancaster. Stenhouse, who campaigns against
``too damned much government'' faces businessman Don Davis, 60, and
oil heater repairman Ken Brosman, 39.
   _WEST VIRGINIA: Rockefeller, an heir to one of America's biggest
fortunes, faces two underfinanced rivals. Republican John Yoder, a
lawyer and onetime aide to former Chief Justice Warren Burger, is
unopposed for his party's nomination.
   Ms. Caperton has cited her management of her own $5 million
portfolio in addition to an estimated $11 million she reportedly
received from her divorce settlement as evidence she can handle the
state's finances. Opponents have characterized her as a socialite
ill-equipped to handle the state's books, which are awash in red
ink.
   The governor has remained neutral as polls show his former wife
in a close race with Larrie Bailey, a former state treasurer. Two
others are also on the ballot.
   In the 4th District, Democratic Rep. Nick Joe Rahall Jr. is
challenged by Ken Hechler, a congressman for 18 years until he gave
up the office in 1976 to run for governor. Hechler, 75, calls on
voters to elect ``a congressman with high moral standards again,''
a reference to Rahall's having faced drunken driving charges in
California in 1988 and being sued in 1984 by a Las Vegas casino for
gambling debts.
   _ INDIANA: A comeback effort is under way in the 1st District,
where Democratic Rep. Peter Visclosky faces Katie Hall, whom he
ousted in 1984. Ms. Hall, who served one term as the state's only
black congresswoman, also lost to Visclosky in 1986. Two others are
also seeking the Democratic nomination in the district, which
includes Gary.
   Indiana has a Senate election this year but no primary.
Republican Sen. Dan Coats, who was appointed to replace Vice
President Dan Quayle, will face Democratic state Rep. Baron Hill in
November.
   _NEW JERSEY: In Atlantic City, incumbent James L. Usry, the
city's first black mayor who is under indictment for bribery, faces
six challengers in a non-partisan primary. If no one gains a
majority, the two front-runners will meet again June 12.

   Six Democrats squared off Tuesday for a chance to oppose Sen.
Jesse Helms of North Carolina, Rep. Donald ``Buz'' Lukens sought to
survive a sex scandal in Ohio, and a former West Virginia first
lady tried to rejoin her ex-husband _ as state treasurer.
   In other highlights of the busiest day of primary voting so far
this year, former Democratic Reps. Katie Hall of Indiana and Ken
Hechler of West Virginia bid for comebacks in their old districts.
Ms. Hall challenged Rep. Pete Visclosky and Hechler went up against
Rep. Nick Joe Rahall Jr.
   In North Carolina, 100-year-old Henry Merritt Stenhouse ran in a
Republican primary for Congress.
   And in Atlantic City, N.J., Mayor James L. Usry, the city's
first black mayor who is under a bribery indictment, faced six
challengers in a non-partisan primary.
   Sen. Jay Rockefeller faced two token Democratic challengers in
West Virginia. Republican attorney John Yoder is the unopposed GOP
candidate.
   Ohio Attorney General Anthony J. Celebrezze Jr. had one
Democratic opponent in his drive for the nomination for governor.
Former Cleveland Mayor George Voinovich is the Republican nominee.
   The race that attracted most attention was North Carolina's
Democratic Senate primary. Late polls showed Harvey Gantt, the
black former mayor of Charlotte, leading, but state law requires a
June 5 runoff unless one candidate gets more than 40 percent of the
total.
   ``We are not going to win this World Series by dividing
ourselves up in the league championship,'' Gantt said in a
last-minute appeal to voters to unite behind him as the best hope
of denying the deeply conservative Helms a fourth term.
   The three other main contenders were John Ingram, a former state
insurance commissioner; Michael Easley, the Brunswick County
district attorney, and R.P. ``Bo'' Thomas, a former state senator.
   Helms himself had token opposition from two challengers in the
GOP primary.
   West Virginia's Democratic primary for treasurer featured Dee
Caperton, whose 23-year marriage to Gov. Gaston Caperton ended last
fall in a highly publicized divorce. The governor has remained
neutral as polls showed his former wife in a close race with Larrie
Bailey, a former state treasurer. Two others also are on the ballot.
   In western Ohio, Lukens faced three GOP primary opponents,
including Thomas Kindness, who formerly held the seat.
   At the other end of the state, voters in Cuyahoga County decided
whether to raise taxes on liquor and cigarettes to finance a new
stadium for baseball's Cleveland Indians.

   Helms has always been a target of liberal and moderate Democrats
because of his strongly conservative stands, including opposition
to abortion and federal funding for art exhibits he considers
obscene. In 1984, with President Reagan heading the GOP ticket,
Helms turned back a strong challenge by former Gov. Jim Hunt by 52
percent to 48 percent.
   Indiana also has a Senate election this year but no primary.
Republican Sen. Dan Coats, who was appointed to replace Vice
President Dan Quayle, will face Democratic state Rep. Baron Hill in
November.
   The Ohio governor's race is expected to be a heated contest this
fall, as the GOP banks on the highly popular Voinovich to reclaim
the post from the Democrats. Two-term incumbent Richard Celeste was
barred by state law from seeking a third term.
   Lukens insisted on running despite party officials' call for his
resignation after he was convicted last year on a misdemeanor
charge of having sex with a 16-year-old girl. His troubles grew
when The Columbus Dispatch reported that the state Tax Department
had certified him as delinquent because of $1,500 in unpaid
personal income taxes.
   Ms. Caperton cited her management of her own $5 million
portfolio in addition to an estimated $11 million she reportedly
received from her divorce settlement as evidence she could handle
the state's finances. Opponents said the former beauty queen and
socialite was ill-equipped to handle the state's troubled finances.

   Lawyers for dissident soldiers
accused of trying to overthrow President Corazon Aquino walked out
of court today after military judges denied their motion
questioning the legality of the tribunal.
   One of the civilian lawyers told the court he would not
participate further in the trial and left the chamber, followed by
the other defense lawyers. They were cheered by 21 officers accused
of participating in the December coup attempt.
   The officers, including two generals, were the first soldiers to
face court martial in the Dec. 1-9 coup attempt, the strongest and
bloodiest of six bids to topple Mrs. Aquino since she took office
four years ago in an uprising against the late Ferdinand Marcos.
   All 21 have been charged with mutiny, murder, attempted murder
and conduct unbecoming an officer. They could receive life
imprisonment if convicted of all charges.
   One of the accused, Brig. Gen. Jose Commendador, declared,
``This is worse than a kangaroo court,'' and said the defendants
would not participate in the trial if they were not represented by
their civilian lawyers.
   Commendador led rebel troops in occupying an air base in the
central Philippines for nine days.
   During the opening session, defense lawyers filed several
motions, including one challenging the authority of military Chief
of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa to appoint the court.
   Defense lawyer Pablito Sanidad argued that de Villa should not
personally have appointed the judges because he was in effect a
``co-accuser'' since his residence was bombed and destroyed in the
coup attempt.
   The defense also argued that the order creating the court and
appointing its members was not signed by de Villa, but the military
judges ruled that the tribunal was ``duly constituted.''
   ``I'm sorry I cannot stand in behalf of my client and could not
be a willing instrument over this illegally assembled body,''
former Appellate Court Judge Alfredo Lazaro told the judges before
leading the walkout of about a dozen lawyers.
   Lazaro represented Lt. Col. Romelino Gojo, a marine commander
who led rebel troops in taking over the suburban Villamor Air base.
   A seven-member tribunal, led by Brig. Gen. Demetrio Camua, is
hearing the case. The defendants cheered with raised fists when the
judges entered the courtroom.
   Lozano said defense lawyers will ask the Supreme Court to halt
the trial and rule on the validity of the military court's decision
to go ahead with it.
   The court adjourned until next Tuesday, but government-appointed
military defense lawyers said they were not in a position to lead
the defense.
   Also in Manila, a suspect in the killing of a U.S. Marine said
that he accidentally shot the American during a hold-up near the
U.S.-run Subic Bay Naval Base last week, police said today.
   Renato Angeles, 38, one of two Filipinos arrested in the case,
made the admission during a lie detector late Monday, police said.
He is accused in the May 4 killing of Gunnery Sgt. John Fredette.
   President Corazon Aquino said today that the Philippines would
be prepared if U.S. military bases here are closed when their lease
expires in 1991, a Cabinet official said.
   Mrs. Aquino asked all government departments for suggestions on
next year's budget to support base conversion plans, said Executive
Secretary Catalino Macaraig, chairman of a presidential committee
advising Filipino negotiators in talks with the United States the
future of the facilities.

   Leaders of the World Jewish Congress stood
outside the villa Tuesday where Nazi leaders plotted the Holocaust
and recalled the 6 million dead, including brides and grooms,
rabbis and students and ``dreamers of Zion.''
   ``I will not pray here, because I personally believe that God
turned his face away from this place, as he did from Auschwitz,''
said Edgar M. Bronfman, president of the World Jewish Congress.
   The solemn ceremony in front of the Wannsee Villa, where Nazi
leaders in 1942 mapped out the ``Final Solution,'' was the most
emotional part of the three-day World Jewish Congress in Berlin,
which ended Tuesday.
   It was the first time the Congress had met on German soil, and
some delegates refused to attend, saying their grief was still too
great.
   Wannsee Villa is now in disrepair, with many of the inside walls
ripped out and dusty scaffolding covering one part of the facade.
West Berlin officials have promised to refurbish the villa and turn
it into a Holocaust memorial.
   A tribute composed by Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel, a
concentration camp survivor, called to mind the Holocaust victims.
   It spoke of ``teachers and their pupils, brides and grooms,
intellectuals and workers, rabbis and their disciples, young
revolutionaries and old dreamers of Zion.''
   ``All were doomed. Simply, solely as Jews,'' said the
declaration, read on the 45th anniversary of the collapse of Nazi
Germany in World War II.
   The declaration recalled how the Nazis ``in the name of their
criminal leadership on behalf of their nation, condemned the entire
Jewish people to death and oblivion.''
   ``What does a Jew today feel in this place, marked by evil and
malediction?'' said Wiesel's tribute. ``Fear and trembling, anger
_incommensurate anger, helplessness and grief _ infinite grief.''
   The statement was read in English, Hebrew and German.
   ``If only the walls could speak. If only the trees and clouds
could testify,'' it said. ``We need to hear them, for most German
men and women, in the past refused to speak, refuse to remember.''
   Jewish leaders for years have said that older Germans especially
have refused to face their past. West German President Richard von
Weizsaecker has drawn acclaim at home and abroad for urging fellow
citizens to frankly deal with the horrors of the Nazi legacy.
   As the two Germanys rush toward reunification, there have been
fears of a growth of anti-Semitism.
   A top-ranking official from West Germany tried to allay these
fears during a speech to the final session of the Congress.
   ``We will continue with all force the fight against right-wing
extremism and anti-Semitism,'' Interior Minister Wolgang Schaeuble
said.
   Before the ceremony, Bronfman and other leaders of the
organization toured the inside of the villa.
   They stood in what is known as the ``Fireplace Room,'' the room
that historians say is most likely the one used for the conference.
   There, Nazi SS boss Reinhard Heydrich and his co-conspirators
planned the ``Final Solution,'' the extermination of European Jews.
   ``It's just absolutely mind-boggling, when you hear that
Heydrich wanted to come here to a secluded spot because he wasn't
sure his colleagues would go along with him,'' said Bronfman. ``He
he was so happy they did, he took a glass of brandy and had a
cigar. What kind of people were these?''
   Later, Congress leaders traveled to East Berlin for a meeting
with Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere.
   ``There has never been a Germany without Jews,'' de Maiziere
told the Jewish delegation. ``There can only be a Germany with
Jews, or there won't be any Germany.''
   The democratically elected East German government, in a dramatic
gesture, last month accepted joint responsibility for the
Holocaust. For more than four decades, the now-ousted Communist
authorities had denied any responsibility.
   Bronfman, during the East Berlin visit, called for a memorial to
be built at the site of the now crumbling Berlin Wall to recall the
significance of Nov. 9, 1938, and Nov. 9, 1989.
   On the date last year, the Berlin Wall was opened. On Nov. 9,
1938, Nazi thugs throughout Germany started ransacking Jewish
stores and homes and killing dozens of Jews in what has been called
Kristallnacht, because of the masses of broken glass that littered
the streets afterward.

   The easiest way for Rep. Stephen Solarz to
become a millionaire is to quit his job. Ditto for Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski.
   Solarz and Rostenkowski, both Democrats, are among 184 lawmakers
eligible to put leftover campaign cash to personal use if they
retire from the House by January 1993.
   They can take the money and not run.
   Until 1979, members of Congress were allowed to convert leftover
campaign funds to personal use when they retired. But Congress
voted that year to halt the practice for lawmakers elected after
January 1980.
   Last year, Congress voted to totally ban the practice. The
measure, however, delayed the effective date of the prohibition to
January 1993, giving those eligible more than two years to decide
whether to retire and take the money.
   The Senate bars members from converting campaign funds, but all
members of Congress are allowed to use their campaign accounts for
political purposes after leaving office.
   House members may keep whatever campaign funds they had as of
Nov. 30, 1989 _ about $40 million for the 184 House members covered
by the clause.
   Sixty of the 184 members had at least $100,000 in their campaign
accounts at the cutoff date; a handful had less than $5,000.
   One, Kentucky Democrat William Natcher, is eligible but reported
a zero campaign balance a month after the cutoff date.
   Most House members are reluctant to discuss whether the deadline
will affect their political plans for 1992, saying they are
concentrating on legislative business and the 1990 elections.
   But the aging of many senior House members and redistricting as
a result of the 1990 census has led to speculation that 1992 will
be a high turnover year.
   ``Retirement in 1992 is going to be attractive to a lot of older
members,'' said William Schneider, a political analyst at the
American Enterprise Institute.
   Older incumbents who see their safe districts shaken up by
redistricting may ``be tempted to just retire and keep their
campaign money,'' Schneider said. ``Of course they'll come up with
any number of other public reasons for deciding not to run.''
   Solarz is among the those whose futures could be affected by
redistricting. New York City probably will lose a congressional
seat and Solarz could end up in a race against a fellow incumbent,
perhaps Democrat Charles Schumer.
   But Solarz, who had a $1.5 million campaign war chest at the
cutoff, repeatedly has said he has no plans to retire before 1993
and that he would not convert his campaign cash if defeated.
   Rostenkowski is unopposed this fall, and many of his colleagues
think the Chicago lawmaker will retire after one more term. He had
$1 million in campaign funds at the Nov. 30, 1989, cutoff and has
been vague about his plans.
   ``We're focusing on this year's agenda and winning re-election
in 1990 and then we'll worry about 1992,'' said Rostenkowski
spokesman Jim Jaffe.
   Rostenkowski has not said whether he would take his campaign
funds with him if he left office before the deadline, Jaffe said.
   ``But it's the law that members can convert, and he supports the
law,'' Jaffe said.
   A handful of those retiring from Congress this year could
convert their campaign funds to personal use.
   One retiring member, Kansas Republican Robert Whittaker, has
said he would not use his $500,000-plus in excess campaign money
for personal purposes.
   Georgia Democrat Doug Barnard, who says his next House term will
be his last, has more than $500,000 and has said he might convert
some for personal use.
   Retiring Rep. Bill Frenzel, a Minnesota Republican who has more
than $300,000 left, plans to refund all 1989 and 1990 campaign
contributions, pay bills and give the remainder to other candidates.
   Most of the others who are eligible avoid the subject.
   ``They don't like to advertise it because it just makes people
angry,'' Schneider said.
   Once lawmakers retire, they don't have to worry about whether
such criticism will cost them votes.
   Former Rep. Samuel Stratton of New York wrote himself a check
for nearly $200,000 from campaign funds last year. Retired Ohio
Republican Rep. Delbert Latta converted $123,000.
   Missouri Republican Gene Taylor closed his campaign account last
year by giving $52,000 to charity and $345,000 to himself.

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl today rejected
Moscow's suggestion that the two Germanys could unite and decide
later which military alliances they will join, and East Germany
said it was also skeptical.
   Speaking to reporters, Kohl said the matter of a united
Germany's military allegiances must be cleared up before the two
German nations are formally merged.
   Kohl said the Germans ``need no singularization,'' meaning that
a united Germany should have its sovereignty.
   The chancellor was referring to a suggestion by Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze at last week's unification talks in
Bonn that formal unity could occur before ``external'' aspects of
the merger process are cleared up.
   East Germany also reacted negatively to Shevardnadze's weekend
proposals.
   Government officials in East Berlin are ``skeptical'' of
delaying a settlement on the ``external'' aspects of unification,
said the East German news agency ADN, and want ``a quick
continuation'' of the six-nation talks.
   During Saturday's meeting of the two Germanys and the four World
War II victors, Shevardnadze also suggested a ``transition period''
during which the four wartime allies would retain postwar rights
even after German unity.
   Shevardnadze's remarks had initially triggered jubilation among
some West German politicians, who sensed the pace of unification
was rapidly picking up.
   But by today that had changed into concern about delaying
settlement of the international aspects of German unification.
   There had even been talk among some politicians of canceling
West Germany's Dec. 2 federal balloting in favor of elections for a
united Germany's parliament.
   But Kohl said today ``without question'' the Dec. 2 elections
will still occur.
   The United States, the Soviet Union, France and Britain jointly
control many matters in the former German capital of Berlin.
   They also have special rights outside Berlin, many involving the
status of the troops they maintain in what once were their post-war
military occupation zones.
   Vernon A. Walters, U.S. ambassador to West Germany, said today
that Washington supports a united Germany with unrestricted
sovereignty and without special rights for any of the World War II
allied victors.
   The question of a united Germany's military attachments has been
one of the greatest obstacles to quick reunification. The Soviet
Union rejects a unified Germany as a member the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization, but the NATO allies insist the new Germany
belong to the Western alliance.
   At the weekend meetings, Shevardnadze said he envisions the four
World War II victors keeping troops on German soil for a few years
after unification until the issue of a united Germany's military
allegiance is settled.
   The Bonn talks were attended by the foreign ministers of the two
Germanys, France, Britain and the Soviet Union as well as U.S.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   The Netherlands, a NATO member, expressed doubts Monday about
the latest Soviet idea.
   ``I clearly see complications if there is a de-coupling of
German unification from the military question,'' Dutch Foreign
Minister Hans van den Broek told reporters.
   ``It sounds like the Germans are cutting a deal'' that would
allow unification while leaving military links undecided, said one
Dutch official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Washington has not reacted to Shevardnadze's suggestion.

   The fire that broke out early Tuesday aboard
the guided-missile destroyer USS Conyngham off North Carolina,
killing one crew member and injuring at least nine others, was the
first serious Navy accident since a six-week string last fall.
   Those accidents, which caused 14 fatalities, prompted the Navy
to review safety procedures in November.
   Here is a rundown of recent serious Navy accidents:
   _Oct. 11, 1989. An officer aboard the helicopter carrier USS Iwo
Jima was killed and a crewman was injured when they were struck by
shrapnel from a shell fired from a nearby cargo ship during an
exercise in the Atlantic Ocean.
   _Oct. 11. A sailor was lost overboard from the frigate USS
Downes 300 miles off Tokyo.
   _Oct. 29. A jet fighter pilot making his first carrier landing
crashed on the deck of the training aircraft carrier USS Lexington
in the Gulf of Mexico, killing himself and four others.
   _Oct. 30. The pilot of an F-A-18 attack jet accidentally dropped
a 500-pound bomb on the cruiser USS Reaves in the Indian Ocean,
slightly injuring five sailors.
   _Oct. 30. A sailor from the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson was
lost overboard in the Pacific Ocean 620 miles from Wake Island.
   _Nov. 1. Three sailors and $4 million worth of aircraft missiles
were swept overboard from the carrier USS Eisenhower off North
Carolina. Two sailors were rescued and one was declared dead.
   _Nov. 1. Nine sailors were injured in a boiler fire aboard the
USS Monongahela 500 miles west of Gibraltar.
   _Nov. 9. A Navy Reserve pilot flying an A-7E attack jet crashed
into an apartment complex in Smyrna, Ga., killing two civilians.
The pilot and one other person were wounded.
   _Nov. 11. One man was killed when the destroyer USS Kincaid
collided with a freighter off the coast of Malaysia.
   _Nov. 14. An F-14 fighter crashed into the Gulf of Mexico 60
miles northwest of Key West, Fla. The two-man crew was not
seriously injured.
   _Nov. 14. A fire aboard the amphibious assault ship USS Inchon
at Norfolk, Va., injured 31 people, eight of them civilians.
   _Nov. 14. A technician at the Naval Surface Weapons Testing
Center in White Oak, Md., was slightly injured in a small lab
explosion.
   _Nov. 22. Two Marines were killed in a crash during exercises
off the Iwo Jima in the western Mediterranean Sea.

   Pope John Paul II said today the
church and state in Mexico are reaching a better understanding
after more than a century of hostility.
   ``The context of the international community is initiating a new
phase of its history, and that will have its repercussions here in
the near future,'' John Paul said in a speech directed to the
teachers of Mexico.
   John Paul was greeted at the airport here by a crowd of more
than 50,000 people doing ``the wave.'' He delivered his speech
under a hot sun for the first time on this trip, and a security
guard held a white parasol over his head.
   Because the pope was only stopping off at the airport here on
the third day of his eight-day journey, the city built replicas of
important downtown colonial buildings as a backdrop.
   ``A new perspective of contacts between the church and the
political community of this country is occurring in this day,'' the
pope said. ``And in this phase of better understanding and
dialogue, the church wants to offer its own support, without
straying from its specific goals and abilities.''
   The church is severely restricted under Mexico's constitution,
although many of the restrictions are ignored. The speech was the
pope's most direct public reference to President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari's moves toward normalization of church-state relations.
   The pope said teachers must strive for a ``leap in quality'' to
move education beyond the basics of reading and writing. He said
the church was not a brake on scientific and cultural progress, but
asked teachers to ``open the world of instruction to Christ.''
   The pope drew wild cheers when he spontaneously saluted the
``corazones calientes,'' or ``hot hearts,'' of Aguascalientes,
which means hot waters and refers to the area's thermal springs.
   ``Come back, come back,'' chanted the crowd, waving thousands of
white flags, pennants and hats. The pope's next stop was a shrine
to the Virgin Mary at the nearby town of San Juan de Los Lagos.
   On Monday, in the port city of Veracruz 200 miles east of Mexico
City, the pontiff had defended plans to celebrate the 500th
anniversary of Christianity in the New World from critics who say
the church came as an agent of conquest, repression and disease.
   ``The discovery, the conquest and the evangelization occupy a
decisive, luminous place taken all together, even though they are
not without shadows,'' John Paul told thousands of people at a
waterfront prayer service.
   In Veracruz, the pope spoke from a raised platform along the
Gulf Coast harbor where conquistadors led by Hernan Cortes first
reached Mexico in 1519.
   They were followed five years later by the first group of
missionaries.
   The celebrations planned for 1992, the 500th anniversary
Columbus' arrival in America, have prompted a fierce debate in
Latin America. Critics charge that the European conquerors
destroyed native cultures, and that Roman Catholic priests were an
instrument of conquest.
   In Mexico, Columbus Day is celebrated as ``The Day of the
(Indian) Race,'' and in recent years Indian activists have attacked
memorial ceremonies at the monument to Columbus in downtown Mexico
City.
   John Paul has used the 1992 anniversary as a banner in his
efforts to launch a ``re-evanglization'' or revival of Catholicism
in Latin America. He plans to open a special conference of Latin
American bishops in the Dominican Republic in two years to
celebrate the anniversary.
   ``The evangelization of America, encouraged by the Lord ...
encountered many limits and difficulties which even today wait to
be seen in their true light through an objective study; but there
were also great successes, as demonstrated by the splendid works
that have served as a model and support for your people's road
during these centuries,'' the pope said.
   John Paul cited the examples of three 16th-century priests who
defended the rights of Mexican Indians. He said the church
``receives from Christ the mandate to go and preach the Gospel to
all nations.'
   The pope then returned to Mexico City and held brief meetins
with two former presidents of Mexico, Miguel de la Madrid and Luis
Echevarria.
   The private sessions were a further sign of the warmer climate
between the Vatican and Mexico, which retains some of the most
restrictive religious laws outside the Communist world though they
are widely ignored.
   John Paul also held talks Monday morning with Salinas. The
president named a personal representative to the pope in February
in a possible step toward re-establishment of diplomatic ties
broken in 1926.
   Opposition politicians have criticized Salinas for what they say
is a cynical attempt to shore up the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party's flagging support through rapprochement with
the church.
   ``The whole world can see the political intentions in all
this,'' leftist opposition leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas observed
after Salinas changed plans at the last minute and personally
greeted the pontiff when he arrived Sunday.
   The pontiff is making his second visit to Mexico and his 47th
papal trip outside Italy.

   Endre Bohem, a producer whose credits include
the movie ``The Night Has a Thousand Eyes'' and the TV series
``Rawhide,'' has died. He was 89.
   Bohem died Saturday at his home in Los Angeles.
   Bohem fled his native Hungary shortly after World War I, when he
was denied a college education because he was Jewish. He became a
scenarist in the United States and began producing films.
   Bohem's early writing credits include the 1927 film, ``Desert
Night,'' starring John Gilbert. He worked for the Metro Goldwyn
Mayer and Columbia studios, and at Columbia he produced short
subjects. Among them was the ``Passing Parade'' series.
   His other producing credits include ``Alias Nick Beal,''
starring Ray Milland, ``House of a Thousand Candles,'' ``The
Redhead and the Cowboy'' and ``The Night Has a Thousand Eyes,''
starring Edward G. Robinson.
   Bohem also produced ``Rawhide,'' the western starring Clint
Eastwood as Rowdy Yates. The series ran from 1959 to 1966. Bohem's
other TV series included ``Revlon Mirror'' and ``Ford Theatre.''
   Bohem returned to Hungary in 1968 so that he could produce, with
the national Hugarofilm company, ``The Boys of Paul Street.'' The
feature was hailed as the first joint production involving
companies from the United States and the Eastern bloc. An anti-war
movie, it was nominated for an Academy Award as best foreign
picture.
   Bohem is survived by his wife, Hilda; a son, a daughter, five
grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
   At his request there were no services.

   The Senate voted today to allow IRS, CIA and
FBI agents to participate in political campaigns, rejecting
Republican attempts to maintain the status quo established in the
51-year-old Hatch Act.
   On a 51-46 vote, the Senate rejected an amendment to exclude
employees in the spy and tax agencies plus the Justice Department
and the Federal Election Commission from a Democratic bill that
removes most current restrictions on political activities by civil
service and postal workers.
   The amendment by Senate GOP Leader Bob Dole of Kansas was one of
three unsuccessful attempts by Republicans today to chip away at
the union-sought revisions in the Hatch Act.
   ``Laws restricting those people and what they can do are already
on the books,'' said Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, the principal author
of the proposed Hatch Act revisions. ``They cannot use information
gained on the job politically.''
   Dole contended that the entire bill amounts to a ``pot of gold''
for the Democratic Party because unionized public employees and
their political action committees overwhelmingly favor Democrats.
   Also defeated today were GOP amendments to maintain a ban on
federal workers holding office in the two political parties and
delaying any changes in the Hatch law until after a campaign
finance reform bill is enacted.
   The first amendment by Sen. William V. Roth, R-N.H., was
defeated on a 64-32 vote and the second by GOP Whip Alan K. Simpson
of Wyoming was rejected 61-36.
   Dole hinted on Monday that Republicans might try to attach major
elements of their proposed campaign finance reform bill _ such as a
total abolition of PACs _ to the Hatch Act revisions later this
week. The Senate already has been debating the bill for a week.
   ``lf we banned all PACs, there wouldn't be much demand for this
bill,'' Dole said of the union-sought revisions in the Hatch Act.
   The Hatch law now forbids the nation's 3 million federal civil
service and postal workers from participating actively in politics.
The Democratic bill would lift some restrictions so that federal
employees could hold party offices and solicit campaign funds from
their co-workers, but not from the general public.
   ``The only purpose of this bill,'' Dole said, ``is to make the
federal employee union PACs fatter, of which 88 percent (of their
campaign donations) goes to the other party. This is a big pot of
gold for the Democratic Party.''
   Democrats have repeatedly denied that intent, saying the bill is
intended to give federal workers the same right to freedom of
expression enjoyed by other Americans.
   While Democrats want the Senate to complete action on the Hatch
law revisions before moving to the campaign finance reform, Dole
indicated that Republicans might not wait.
   He said the GOP campaign finance proposal with its abolition of
all PACs ``could come on this measure sometime later this week.''
   Democrats denied any linkage between the proposed Hatch law
changes and campaign finance reform and tried to forestall a
Republican effort to bring the two issues together.
   Despite repeated assertions that President Bush will veto any
changes, Democrats so far have garnered at least a dozen votes from
GOP senators on several challenges by the Republican leadership to
the bill.
   ``It's going to pass,'' said Senate GOP Whip Alan K. Simpson of
Wyoming. ``I'm sure we don't have 40 votes,'' he said, referring to
the number needed to sustain a filibuster.
   Simpson said the major task for Republican leaders will come
later when ``those of us (opposed to the changes) will have to try
to sustain the veto of the president with 34 votes.''
   The House approved a similar but much broader revision of the
Hatch Act by an overwhelming 297-90 vote more 13 months ago.
   The House measure would permit federal workers to seek and hold
elected public office and solicit campaign contributions from the
general public. The Senate bill would retain current prohibitions
against those two activities.

<HEAD>National Home Sales Slip as Mortgage Rates, Prices Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Double-digit mortgage rates and rising prices
dampened existing home sales in many areas during the first three
months of 1990, while boosting them in others, a real estate trade
group reported Tuesday.
   Overall, the National Association of Realtors said sales slipped
1.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.81 million
units during the January-March period, down from 3.87 million units
during the fourth quarter. Sales totaled 3.90 million during the
first quarter of 1989.
   Association president Norman D. Flynn said rising mortgage rates
had the dual effect of spurring sales in moderately-priced areas
while curbing them in higher-end markets.
   ``Buyers in affordable markets decided to buy before rates rose
further, while those in high-cost areas held back,'' Flynn
explained.
   The trade group's survey showed the median price of existing
homes rose 5.2 percent to $95,900, up from $91,200 during the same
period of 1989. The median price means half of the homes cost more,
half less.
   Mortgage rates also rose, starting the quarter at 9.83 percent
and ending it at 10.22 percent, according to the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Association. Rates have continued to rise, and hit 10.67
percent at the end of last week.
   Nevertheless, the Realtors said resales are expected to remain
stable during the year as economic conditions improve.
   The Realtors survey covered sales of existing single-family
detached homes, town houses, apartment condominiums and
cooperatives.
   Sales were up in 29 states, ranging from a 49.1 percent jump in
South Dakota to a 0.9 percent increase in Nevada. At the same time,
Vermont posted a 24.8 percent decrease, the largest decline in the
nation.
   By region, the West saw sales rise 3 percent to an annual rate
of 680,000 units, dominated by activity in California. Flynn
reported some softening in high-cost coastal areas while sales in
some lower-priced interior areas increased.
   The South had across-the-board increases, up 0.7 percent to 1.46
million units, as many oil-patch areas continued to regain strength.
   But the sales pace in the Northeast continued to decline,
dropping 5.5 percent to 690,000 units.
   ``Last quarter's activity (in the Northeast) reflected high home
prices and rising interest rates,'' according to John A. Tuccillo,
the realtor group's chief economist.
   Sales in the Midwest dropped 4.9 percent to 980,000 units, due
to increased interest rates and poor weather conditions, the
Realtors said.
   Median prices rose sharpest in the West, up 7.6 percent to
$143,700. Costs in the Midwest rose 6.9 percent to $74,200.
   Prices advanced 2 percent in the Northeast to $146,200 and 2
percent in the South to $85,800.
   Five Western metropolitan areas continued to have the most
expensive homes, led by Honolulu with a median price of $290,400.
That was followed by the San Francisco Bay area, $262,200; Orange
County, Calif., $243,600; Los Angeles, $211,500, and San Diego,
$182,300. San Diego was tied with Boston.
   The least expensive homes were found in Peoria, Ill., where the
median price was $48,000; Oklahoma City, $50,600; Spokane, Wash.,
$52,000; Mobile, Ala., $58,700, and Louisville, Ky., $59,300.

<TEXT>
   A cyclone packing winds up to 155 mph
zeroed in on the south Indian coast Tuesday night, and authorites
evacuated 100,000 families from a low-lying plain.
   Live electrical wires knocked down by winds preceeding the storm
killed three people in the southern city of Madras, Indian news
reports said. A building collapse injured eight others in the city,
which is about 1,050 miles south of New Delhi.
   Waves 20 feet above normal crashed against parts of India's
southeastern coast Tuesday night as the storm approached. Weather
officials said the cyclone appeared to be stronger than a 1977
storm that killed thousands in southern India.
   Press Trust of India reported that 2,000 people had been
evacuated from Madras.
   Weather officials said the core of the storm was 87 miles east
of Madras over the Bay of Bengal and would cross into India by
early Wednesday.
   A heavily populated, low-lying coastal plain in Andhra Pradesh
state, just north of Tamil Nadu state, was expected to take the
brunt of the storm. Authorities evacuated more than 100,000
families from the area and placed them in 300 camps inland, news
reports said.
   Meteorologists said they expected ``very heavy damage to houses
and installations and disruption of communications,'' Press Trust
of India said.
   Andhra Pradesh's chief minister, M. Chenna Reddy, said army and
navy helicopters and boats had been prepared for rescue operations.
   Heavy winds and rain were reported in several townships along
the coastal plain, he said. One town, Kota, had seven inches of
rain in the past 24 hours.
   Cyclones are the Indian Ocean's equivalent of hurricanes. They
usually come in the spring just before the monsoon season begins.

<HEAD>Researchers Say New Birth Control Pills and IUDs Safer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New birth control pills, containing
one-fifth as much estrogen as the original pills, are safe for
non-smoking women in their 40s and do not raise the risk for clots
or cancer, researchers report.
   Dr. Daniel R. Mishell, chairman of the Department of Obstetrics
and Gynecology at the University of Southern California School of
Medicine, and other doctors gave the update Monday on the latest
safety studies of the pill and IUDs at the annual meeting of the
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
   It also was reported that the Food and Drug Administration is
expected to approve, perhaps this year, surgically implanted
hormone capsules that provide birth control hormones for five
years. This birth control method, with the contraceptives usually
placed under the skin on one arm, already is used in more than 40
countries.
   The implants are as effective as daily birth control pills, said
Dr. Francine Sinofsky of the University of Medicine and Dentistry
of New Jersey.
   Because of health concerns, most American women stop using birth
control pills or IUDs after their prime child bearing years.
Studies show that they are used by less than 5 percent of women 35
and older, and that sterilization is now the No. 1 method of birth
control among women in the age group.
   Mishell noted that women remain potentially fertile until nearly
age 50, and said, ``It is often a real problem deciding what to do.
   ``It's really up to the woman, but there are many highly
reliable, and generally safe, methods of contraception available.''
   The original pills with strong doses of estrogen were found to
increase a tendency toward blood clots. The new pills use a fifth
as much estrogen and add another hormone, progestin, and studies
show that they present no increased risk of cardiovascular disease
or of breast cancer.
   The new pills have labels which say, with FDA approval, that the
benefits of birth control pills may outweigh the risks.
   But, Mishell said, women who smoke should consider the pills
dangerous because nicotine and estrogen together worsen the risk of
blood clotting.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Science teachers should stop spoon-feeding
facts to students and allow them to ``discover the sheer pleasure''
of understanding science, a report said Tuesday.
   The American Association for the Advancement of Science called
for ``vast reform in science education from preschool to
university,'' but said change is most critical at the college level.
   Science, the report said, should be viewed as a liberal art.
   ``The experience of learning science as a liberal art must be
extended to all young people so that they can discover the sheer
pleasure and intellectual satisfaction of understanding science,''
the report said.
   The report, the result of a three-year study by academics in the
arts and sciences, said conventional methods of teaching science
should be abandoned for more student-conducted experiments,
specific goal setting and group work to allow students to analyze
scientific principles.
   Professors who simply lecture on scientific facts in
conventional courses often leave students with ``underdeveloped
intellectual skills and little awareness of the influences of
science on their lives,'' the report said.
   Among the recommendations in the report, ``The Liberal Arts of
Science: Agenda for Action,'' were:
   _Fifty percent of the instruction in a baccalaureate degree
program should be devoted to liberal education; at least one
quarter of that to liberal education in the natural sciences. In
most institutions, that is equivalent to 15 to 16 semester hours of
instruction in science for all students.
   _Student-student and student-faculty interaction should be
increased.
   _There should be a major reform of national achievement and
professional licensing tests. Scientific and professional societies
must revise their exams to include all the goals of liberal studies
in science.
   _Institutions must set specific targets for increasing the
number of science graduates from minority and disadvantaged groups.

<HEAD>Hearing Officer Recommends 13.2 Percent Profit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supporters of voter-approved insurance rate
rollbacks were stung by a recommendation that insurers be allowed a
13.2 percent profit for last year and up to 19 percent in the
future.
   Proposition 103 supporters said Monday's decision by an
administrative law judge could kill voter-approved rate rollbacks.
   ``This decision stands Proposition 103 right on its head and
says, `It's business as usual,''' said Harvey Rosenfield, chief
author of the November 1988 ballot initiative.
   In his decision, Administrative Law Judge William J. Fernandez
recommended a 13.2 percent profit for the year that ended in
November. The recommendation is 2 percent above the long-term
industry average.
   The profit margin would be allowed before an insurer was
required to roll back its rates for automobile, homeowners' and
other lines of property and casualty insurance covered by
Proposition 103.
   Rosenfield, a frequent foe of state Insurance Commissioner
Roxani Gillespie, said: ``It's about what we expected from a judge
hired by Gillespie. ... We think Gillespie ought to just stop
trying to implement Proposition 103 and leave it for the next
commissioner.''
   Asked to respond to Rosenfield's comments, a spokeswoman for
Gillespie said: ``I don't think it's important enough to.''
   ``The important thing is that we have the judge's decision and
the commissioner is reviewing it now,'' said the spokeswoman, Carey
Fletcher. ``I really think we need to stop this Mickey Mouse
politicking.''
   Tom Aceituno, legal affairs counsel for the Association of
California Insurance Companies, said the industry group was still
analyzing the decision and would take ``a wait-and-see attitude to
see what the commissioner does.''
   Gillespie has 100 days to make a final decision, which could be
challenged in court.
   Fernandez did not propose any firm limits for insurers' profits
after November 1989, when the insurance commissioner took over
approval of all rate increases. But he said the evidence would
support a range of 11.2 to 19 percent.
   Fernandez rejected consumer groups' proposals to limit insurance
executive salaries and subject companies to mandatory efficiency
levels before calculating their allowable profit rates.
   ``Liberal democracy is growing in the nations of the Eastern
bloc,'' he said. ``Communism with its regulatory stifling of
individual initiative is being rejected. We in California should
take heed of what is occurring elsewhere.''
   Proposition 103 mandated insurance rates be cut 20 percent below
1987 levels and frozen for a year unless a company faced
insolvency. However, the state Supreme Court ruled last year that a
rollback could not be used to deny an insurer a ``fair rate of
return,'' leaving it to the commissioner to set standards.
   Consumer groups had sought to disqualify Fernandez from the case
because of alleged bias in favor of the insurance industry. They
said he unfairly limited the hearing, preventing them from covering
issues like ``redlining,'' where rates are pegged to geographical
areas, and cross-examination of industry experts.
   Fernandez, whose wife is an attorney for a law firm whose
clients include three insurance companies, rejected their
complaint, saying he had no financial or conflict of interest.

   Charles and Di wow Budapest. Rock
singer Lou Reed gives a private Prague concert for President Vaclav
Havel and friends. Harvard economist Jeffrey Sachs fixes the Polish
economy.
   For jet-setters, royalty, business people and tourists, the rush
is on to Eastern Europe. Revolution has made a region that was
firmly out of fashion during decades of Stalinist drabness the new
hot ticket in travel.
   Travel magazines feature Eastern European locales on their
covers, and Western tourists cram the streets of Prague and
Budapest.
   For some visitors, the attraction is the money that might be
made in markets untapped for more than 40 years.
   Mark Palmer, the former U.S. envoy to Hungary who resigned to
join Estee Lauder heir Ronald S. Lauder in a new development bank
for Central Europe, has likened the business people flocking to
Budapest's Forum Hotel to the gold miners who rushed to the West a
century ago.
   Others making the foray to the East seem to be searching for
something more: the brave, creative spirit that powered eastern
Europe's democratic revolutions and propelled philosophical
intellectuals into positions of political power.
   As Prince Charles told a Budapest university audience Tuesday,
many in the West ``have no conception of what it means to suffer
invasion, persecution and loss of freedom.''
   The prince, known for his diatribes against the trappings of
modernity, congratulated Hungarians and all East Europeans for
preserving their humanity in adversity and begged them to keep it
intact.
   ``You can give us again a heightened sense of the classical
values of the western spirit ... a new realization that democracy
is not just a ballot box _ it is a wise, mature and exacting state
of mind,'' the heir to the British throne stressed.
   From leader to laborer, East Europeans are basking in this new
attention, heaping praise in return on the visitors.
   Frank Zappa, a 1960s counter-culture hero no longer all the rage
at home, found himself feted at every turn in Prague. His zany
lyrics appeal to the Czech love of the absurd.
   Charles and Di drew rave reviews from Hungarians accustomed to
less regal visitors.
   ``We like what we heard, that they help ordinary people a great
deal and go among ordinary people,'' said Pal Kontra, a hospital
worker in his 50s waiting on a Budapest sidewalk to wave to
Princess Diana.
   ``It's quite a change from the faces we've been accustomed to,''
said Budapest homemaker Juliana Szarka.
   ``For 45 years, we had to applaud somebody else,'' noted
pensioner Ilona Wilnrotter as she cheered the new arrivals.
   At the other end of the social scale, the East's new leaders are
making good use of Western good will and the revived interest of
royalty and nobility in their former domains.
   Prince Karl Schwarzenberg, scion of a family that once owned
much of Bohemia, heads a board of foreign advisers appointed by
Havel to help drum up Western investment and interest in the
new-look Czechoslovakia.
   Long barred by the Communists for championing human rights in
the East from his residence in Vienna, the Czech-speaking prince
now has an office in the Prague castle.
   Otto von Hapsburg, once Crown Prince of Hungary and fluent in
its difficult language, is venturing into the eastern reaches of
the empire his family lost after World War I. His latest trip was
last week, to the first session of the new democratically elected
parliament in Budapest.
   Poland's new Solidarity-led government, determined to kick the
Communist habit of following economic plans devised by ill-educated
former peasants and workers, enlisted Sachs, a Harvard University
economist, to draw up recipes for moving swiftly to a free market
economy.
   Dozens of constitutional lawyers and political consultnts have
made the trip East in recent months, advising those unused to
democracy on everything from drafting new laws to designing catchy
political ads.
   Jane Fonda, one of many stars drawn to Havel's
made-for-Hollywood ascent from political prisoner to president,
perhaps provided the most unusual service to date for the fledgling
East European democracies.
   Reportedly fired up by visits to the students who started
Czechoslovakia's revolution and to the Civic Forum movement that
led it, she invited a Prague activist back to California. There,
she initiated him in the ultimate Western custom _ a political
fundraiser that garnered Civic Forum $25,000 for its current
election campaign.

   President Bush today assured Bolivian
President Jaime Paz Zamora that ``you and your countrymen will not
stand alone'' in fighting cocaine and trying to improve Bolivia's
ailing economy.
   Winding up three hours of talks at the White House, Bush
promised he would seek a substantial increase in economic aid for
Bolivia next year, beyond the $88 million earmarked for this year.
He said Paz, in their private talks, had stressed the importance of
Bolivia receiving development assistance.
   Paz, standing alongside Bush at a farewell ceremony on the South
Lawn, pledged full cooperation in anti-drug efforts.
   ``We are fervent allies and we are ready to give you all of our
efforts and all of our cooperation ... to everything that would be
of a common interest,'' Paz said.
   Bush credited Paz with overseeing the destruction of more acres
of coca production in the first four months of the year than was
eradicated during all of 1989.
   Saying that Bolivia deserves U.S. help, Bush said, ``You and
your countrymen will not stand alone in the fight against cocaine
or in the drive for economic development.
   ``Because we do want what you want and that is economic benefit
for your people,'' Bush said. ``And so together we're going to wage
a strong fight.''
   At the start of their Oval Office meeting, Bush told Paz he had
``great respect for what you have done in your country for the
economy and for the fight against narcotics that means so much to
us.''
   Paz greeted Bush as a friend and said it was fitting they should
meet in the White House, because it symbolized the ``cleanliness
and the transparency of our friendship and of the relationship
between our two countries.''
   The visit comes as U.S. officials tout Bolivia's efforts to
reduce its role as a major supplier of U.S.-bound cocaine.
   A U.S. official who briefed reporters on Monday said the United
States plans to ``double or triple'' the number of U.S. trainers
who are helping Bolivians in the war against coca leaf production.
At present, the number of such trainers rotating in and out of
Bolivia runs between 20 and 50.
   Bolivia is the world's second largest producer of coca, but
lately Bolivian farmers have been eager to experiment with
alternative crops. The prime reason is that the drug crackdown in
Colombia, where coca leaves are processed into cocaine, has led to
a drastic decline in demand for Bolivian coca.
   In La Paz, published reports quoted Bolivian officials as saying
Paz is unhappy with U.S. aid levels and plans to ask for more
during his visit. The Washington Post reported today that he would
ask Bush for up to $150 million a year in new aid.
   The Colombian campaign began last summer with strong U.S.
encouragement.
   Bolivia also has been carrying out what U.S. officials describe
as a highly successful eradication program _ 1,000 hectares of coca
destroyed in April alone.
   The U.S. officials, asking not to be identified, said 3,500
hectares have been eliminated thus far this year. Still, more than
50,000 hectares are being used for coca production.
   Bolivia has been singled out as one of the principal recipients
of U.S. military aid under Bush's anti-drug program.
   The program totaled only $5 million in 1989 but leaped to $35
million this year and is expected to be around the same amount
during the next fiscal year. The total 1991 aid package requested
by the administration, including economic assistance, is $150
million.
   Some of the aid is earmarked for a program under which Bolivian
farmers who agree to stop growing coca leaves are given a $2,000
per hectare credit for switching to an alternate crop. A hectare is
about 2.5 acres.
   Until the mid-1980s, U.S. relations with Bolivia were not good,
a reflection of American displeasure over the alleged involvement
of the Bolivian military in drug trafficking during the extended
periods when generals ran the country.
   Paz, an elected civilian, is the first Bolivian to make an
official visit in a generation, the U.S. officials said.

<TEXT>
   Several rockets slammed into the
Afghan capital of Kabul on Tuesday, killing six people and wounding
13, Radio Kabul reported.
   The state-run radio broadcast, monitored in Islamabad, claimed
the rockets were fired by ``Pakistan-based extremists,'' an
apparent reference to U.S.-armed Moslem insurgents.
   Afghan rebels have been fighting for 12 years to unseat Kabul's
Communist-style government. Most rebel factions are based in
Pakistan.
   Five surface-to-surface rockets battered a residential area of
Kabul, the radio broadcast said, although it was not possible to
independently verify the report.
   The reported attack was the second in as many days. One person
was killed Monday when several rockets hit the city.
   No one claimed responsibility for either attack.
   Rebel fighters claim they target only military installations,
although they admit their rockets misfire occasionally and hit
civilian targets.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Fights to Keep Videotape of Barry Arrest as Evidence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A videotape that federal prosecutors say shows
Mayor Marion Barry smoking crack cocaine should be admitted as
evidence at the mayor's June trial, the government said Tuesday.
   The defense wants the tape barred when Barry faces charges of
drug possession and perjury.
   Meanwhile, sources familiar with the investigation said U.S.
Attorney Jay B. Stephens will ask the grand jury to return as many
as five additional indictments against the mayor.
   The new indictments would likely be misdemeanors, the sources
said.
   The grand jury that indicted Barry on Feb. 15 met Tuesday, but
adjourned without taking any action.
   Barry, who already faces five misdemeanor cocaine possession
charges and three felony counts of lying to a grand jury about his
alleged drug use, has pleaded innocent to all charges.
   In papers filed in U.S. District Court, Stephens argued that the
videotape of the events before Barry's Jan. 18 arrest was made with
the consent of Rasheeda Moore, a government witness who cooperated
with the sting operation.
   Prosecutors say Barry was arrested in Moore's hotel room after
he bought crack from an undercover FBI agent and smoked it.
   Defense lawyer R. Kenneth Mundy has argued that the videotape
should be barred because it was made before other routine methods
of surveillance were tried.
   Stephens said the procedure was valid because Moore authorized
her room to be bugged.
   Stephens also urged Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson to deny
Mundy's request that four of the misdemeanor possession charges be
consolidated, saying each was ``a separate, distinct illegal drug
transaction.''
   Jackson has set a pre-trial hearing for May 25. Trial has been
set for June 4.
   If Barry is convicted of any of the felony charges, he would be
barred from holding office. He has not said whether he will seek a
fourth term in November.

<HEAD>Israel Benefits From Special Long-Lasting US Aid Provisions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With its economy in dire straits, Israel came
to the United States in 1982 for a favor: Would the U.S. pay a full
year's $910 million in economic aid all at once, instead of the
usual quarterly installments?
   The government said yes. Eight years later, the Israeli economy
is in better shape, but the unique treatment for Israel's foreign
aid remains a part of U.S. law.
   Not only does Israel still get its aid money up front each year,
but since it doesn't need it immediately, it uses the money to buy
U.S. Treasury bonds _ lending the United States back its own cash
and earning an additional $76.7 million in interest.
   And to make the immediate payment to Israel each year, the
United States borrows the aid funds, at an additional interest cost
of up to $70 million.
   U.S. law is suffused with such special treatment for its Middle
Eastern ally, with a value this year of $742 million _ on top of $3
billion in cash foreign aid. And the list of special provisions
could grow this week when lawmakers deal with a bill containing
$400 million in loan guarantees to build housing for Soviet Jews
emigrating to Israel.
   The Senate's version of the bill would waive some $25 million in
administrative fees, along with the usual requirements on
eligibility for the housing and auditing of the money. A competing
House version is silent on the concessions, and conferees are
scheduled to meet to work out the differences.
   Dozens of provisions already in the law confer special status to
Israel in business and financial dealings, trade, military
cooperation and global politics. And like the advance aid payments,
many remain in effect even though they have outlived their original
justifications.
   In answer, supporters of Israel note its strategic position in
the unstable Middle East, its valuable sharing of intelligence
information about the region and about global terrorism, and shared
political and religious values between the two countries.
   Much of the aid also is portrayed as a reward for the 1979 Camp
David peace accord with Egypt, in which Israel gave up large tracts
of land.
   But a few members of Congress are beginning to raise questions
about the aid, particularly in light of new competing demands for
scarce aid dollars from emerging democracies in Eastern Europe and
Latin America.
   ``In the long run, I do not think the present high levels of aid
are good for Israel or good for the United States,'' said Rep. Lee
Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
Subcommittee on the Middle East.
   ``It should not be looked on as an entitlement program,'' said
Hamilton, who has sought to change the foreign aid law to eliminate
special-interest provisions dealing not only with Israel but with
other recipients as well.
   Aside from the issue of money availability, Israel's popularity
has been strained recently. Many in the United States, including
some in the Bush administration, resent what they see as harsh
Israeli tactics in quelling a Palestinian uprising in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip. The administration is also frustrated by
Israel's unwillingness to start talks on Palestinian self rule.
   Still, the aid to Israel seems secure. That was demonstrated by
a test vote last week in the House, when a resolution affirming
Jerusalem as the capital of Israel passed 378 to 34. That is the
Israeli government's position, in the face of Arab criticism.
   ``You are not going to see anybody in Congress suggest that the
Middle East get less money than the administration asked for,''
said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., chairman of the Appropriations
foreign operations subcommittee.
   ``Nobody is going to take onto their own shoulders the
responsibility for blowing up what is already a highly volatile
situation,'' he said.
   One of Israel's staunchest supporters, Rep. Larry Smith, D-Fla.,
said that to make any fundamental change in aid now would not only
worsen Israel's internal situation, but would ``send the worst
signal of all'' to neighboring Arab states that are privately
beginning to accept Israel's right to exist.
   A spokeswoman for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee,
which lobbied for many of the special provisions, said continued
aid is important because of instability in the region, including
terrorism and the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons.
   ``Aid helps to maintain Israel as a strong, stable, staunchly
pro-U.S. democratic ally, which is fundamental to America's
interests,'' said the spokeswoman, Toby Dershowitz. ``Aid signals
that the U.S. is willing to invest in peace in a turbulent but
vital region.''
   Israel's preferred status dates to President Harry S. Truman's
recognition of the newly formed state on May 14, 1948. Since then,
the United States has paid out $45.8 billion in direct aid, making
it the top recipient in the world.
   That figure does not include the hundreds of millions of dollars
Israel receives in indirect help from the United States, such as
the advance aid payment provision or the likely waiver of housing
loan guarantee fees.
   The United States imposes few conditions on Israel in exchange
for its aid. Economic assistance, for example, is not tied to
specific development projects as it is in other recipient
countries. Rather, noted a General Accounting Office report, the
money ``serves a budget support and political purpose.''

   The Bush administration has told Salvadoran
President Alfredo Cristiani that the investigation into the murders
of six Jesuits is ``a serious matter'' that could affect U.S.
attitudes on continued aid to El Salvador.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said today that message
was delivered by White House chief of Staff John Sununu. Cristiani
and Sununu met Monday in San Jose, Costa Rica, where both were
attending the presidential inauguration.
   Cristiani sought the meeting with Sununu, the spokesman said.
   Fitzwater said Sununu told Cristiani the killing of the Jesuits
``is a serious matter for the U.S. that must be properly addressed
and ...that prosecution of this case would have a significant
impact in America.''
   Nine Salvadoran military men are accused of murdering the six
Jesuit educators last November in San Salvador. Critics say the
investigation has come to a virtual standstill due to footdragging
on the part of the Salvadoran government.
   Fitzwater said Sununu told Cristiani there were anti-aid
feelings in Congress because of the stalled investigation. When
asked whether the adminisitration would back away from its support
of new aid for El Salvador, the spokesman said, ``The
administration and everyone in America is concerned about the
prosecution of the murders and that obviously would have an impact
on American attitudes.''
   However, he said the administration stands by its request for
$90 million in military aid to El Salvador for next year.
   ``We take him at his word that he's trying to prosecute this to
the best of his ability. There are these complicating matters,''
Fitzwater said, alluding to reports that key evidence in the case
is missing, including the diary of a Salvadoran commander accused
in the case.
   The State Department said Monday that the U.S. embassy in San
Salvador has been asked to confirm whether the diary is indeed
missing.
   Loss of that evidence ``would hurt the efforts to extend the
investigation and could impact on the prosecution of those already
implicated,'' a State Department spokesman said.
   The administration has avoided directly criticizing Cristiani,
but has stepped up pressure on him to get the investigation back on
track.

<TEXT>
   Democrats in Congress on Tuesday urged the
Bush administration to prevent aid for the ``basic human needs'' of
the Chinese people from opening resumed loans to China by the World
Bank.
   ``It would be a very disappointing state of affairs indeed if
basic human needs were used as a loophole'' to allow continued
repression by the Beijing government, said Rep. Nancy Pelosi,
D-Calif.
   Members of the House Banking subcommittee questioned the
administration's policy of no longer opposing World Bank loans to
China for human needs, such as a $30 million credit approved in
February for earthquake reconstruction.
   Deputy Assistant Treasury Secretary John M. Niehuss told the
panel some $750 million in World Bank loans to China are still
delayed as a result of Beijing's 1989 crackdown on democracy
demonstrations, including about $550 million that would meet basic
human needs.
   Niehuss said there was ``increasingly strong pressure ... from
some of our major allies to resume'' lending to China, and stressed
the United States does not have the voting power to block World
Bank loans on its own.
   He declined to name the allies but reports from Beijing have
told of eagerness for resumed lending by Japan and Canada, other
major shareholders of the 152-nation World Bank.
   ``Five hundred and fifty million dollars is a great deal of
money,'' said Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., a member of the
subcommittee on international development. But ``if the basic human
needs standard becomes too broad in interpretation, it will become
a farce, a loophole. And that's what we would like to avoid.''
   The World Bank executive board plans to review Chinese
creditworthiness and commitment to economic reform at the end of
May, Niehuss said, and the United States will ask ``whether
significant lending is appropriate based on the current economic
situation and policies.''
   But Rep. Joseph Kennedy, D-Mass., charged that the
administration was quick to block World Bank loans to smaller
countries crushing human rights or resisting economic reform, ``but
when they happen to be bigger countries all of a sudden we lose our
will.''

<HEAD>U.S. Suggests Soviets Join Ethiopian Food Airlift</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has suggested a joint
airlift with the Soviet Union to provide food for Ethiopia, where
famine threatens hundreds of thousands of people, a State
Department official said Tuesday.
   The department is awaiting a response from Moscow, said Herman
J. Cohen, the assistant secretary of state for Africa.
   Cohen said Secretary of State James Baker III presented the idea
to Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze at their recent
meeting in Bonn, West Germany.
   The famine stems in part from a civil war between the Marxist
government of President Mengistu Haile Mariam and secessionist
rebels in the northern provinces of Tigray and Eritrea.
   Mengistu has long received military hardware and logistical aid
from the Soviet Union, but Cohen said the Soviets' direct
involvement in the war appears to be tapering off.
   Cohen and others told a House Select Committee on Hunger that
the food situation in Ethiopia is better than it was two months
ago, but that the situation remains precarious.
   Eritrean rebels captured the strategically located port of
Massawa in February and agreed to a truce that would allow the food
to pass through the port. The Ethiopians have not agreed to the
truce.
   However, Cohen said the Ethiopians may be ``slowly coming around
to see that food relief is a humanitarian'' issue, not a military
one.
   ``Three million people are still at risk,'' said Andrew Natsios
of the Agency for International Development. ``Until Massawa is
open, none of us can sleep comfortably at night.''
   While recent efforts to deliver food through Sudan and the
government-controlled port of Asseb have helped, the situation
remains grim, Natsios said.
   ``I am very concerned that the success ... has created the
impression that we have met the challenge of moving food into the
north,'' he said. ``We have not.''

<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Tuesday
firmly rejected Moscow's suggestion that settling the military
complexities of a united Germany could be delayed until after the
countries are merged.
   ``It would be a fatal development if the external and internal
conditions of German unity were not completely clear when the day
of German unity comes,'' Kohl told reporters.
   The chancellor was referring to a suggestion by Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze that formal German unity could occur
before ``external'' aspects of the merger are cleared up.
   Such ``external'' aspects would include those issues with
international implications, such as the military stance of a united
Germany. West Germany currently belongs to NATO, while East Germany
is a member of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   The Soviets oppose a united Germany in NATO.
   During reunification talks Saturday in Bonn, Shevardnadze also
suggested a ``transition period'' during which the four wartime
allies would retain postwar rights, even after German unity.
   The United States, the Soviet Union, France and Britain jointly
control many matters in the former German capital of Berlin. They
also have special rights outside Berlin, many involving the status
of the troops they maintain in what once were their postwar
military occupation zones.
   Shevardnadze's remarks initially triggered jubilation among some
West German politicians, who sensed the pace of unification was
picking up.
   But by Tuesday that had changed to concern about delaying
settlement of important issues related to German unification.
   There had even been talk among some politicians of canceling
West Germany's Dec. 2 national election in favor of elections for a
united Germany's parliament.
   But Kohl said Tuesday ``without question'' the Dec. 2 elections
will still occur.
   Vernon A. Walters, the U.S. ambassador to West Germany, said
Tuesday that Washington supports a united Germany with unrestricted
sovereignty and without special rights for any of the World War II
allied victors.
   ``A united Germany should have full control over its entire
state territory, without any sort of new discriminating limitations
of German sovereignty,'' Walters told a Frankfurt meeting of West
German newspaper and broadcast susbscribers to The Associated Press.
   While the United States has promised it won't stand in the way
of full sovereignty for a united Germany, it has also made clear it
wants a merged Germany to be part of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   Kohl has also vowed that a united Germany will be a NATO member.
   Moscow has suggested as a compromise that a united Germany
belong to both NATO and the Warsaw Pact until still-undefined
European ``security structures'' are created.
   Both Washington and Bonn have said they are prepared to allow
Soviet troops to remain on what is now East German territory for an
interim period, but both have rejected a dual-bloc membership.
   East Germany also reacted negatively to Shevardnadze's weekend
proposals.
   Government officials in East Berlin are ``skeptical'' of
delaying a settlement on the international issues involved in
unification, said the East German news agency ADN.
   Kohl said his government is hoping that the six-nation talks on
unification, which began Saturday, will conclude before the end of
this fall. He said the international aspects of German unification
will likely be discussed at the U.S.-Soviet summit at the end of
this month, and at a special NATO summit in London in July.

   Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV sought
nomination to a second term Tuesday, and former first lady Dee
Caperton competed in a Democratic primary for state treasurer.
   Also on the Democratic ballot was a comeback effort by Ken
Hechler, the secretary of state who sought his old congressional
job back. He challenged Rep. Nick Joe Rahall.
   In the Senate race, Democrats Paul Nuchims and Ken Thompson were
attempting to unseat Rockefeller, heir to one of America's largest
fortunes.
   Ms. Caperton, 47, the former wife of Gov. Gaston Caperton, ran
against Larrie Bailey, a former treasurer, Marie Prezioso, a
Charleston investment banker and one of Bailey's former employees,
and Eugene Knotts, a Wood County assessor.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Nuchims, who bills himself as a ``conceptual artist,'' spent
less than $500 on his campaign. Thompson proved elusive to
reporters during the campaign.
   The Republican Senate nominee is John Yoder, 39, a Harpers Ferry
lawyer and former aide to retired Chief Supreme Court Justice
Warren Berger.
   Ms. Caperton, a former beauty queen, said she was qualified to
run the state's finances and pointed to her management of her own
$5 million portfolio in addition to an estimated $11 million she
reportedly received from her divorce settlement with the governor
last fall.
   The new treasurer will finish the final two years of former
Treasurer A. James Manchin's term. Manchin resigned last July to
avoid a Senate trial after being impeached for his part in losses
to the state investment fund. The governor appointed state Sen.
Thomas Loehr as treasurer, but Loehr decided not to run for the job.
   The lone GOP candidate for treasurer is Elvin F. Martin, a
certified public accountant.
   Hechler, 75, was making his third bid to recapture the U.S.
House seat he gave up in 1976 after 18 years in a failed
gubernatorial bid against Rockefeller.

   Wilson County may not seem like the fast

   She was clocked at 90 mph Sunday afternoon on U.S. 264 _ which
has a speed limit of 55 mph, said Sgt. W.M. Gay of the state
Highway Patrol.
   The Oscar nominee, who played a sultry chanteuse in ``The
Fabulous Baker Boys'' and a French temptress in ``Dangerous
Liaisons,'' had to appear before a magistrate Sunday and post bail
of $100.
   She was in Wilson for the filming of ``Love Field,'' the story
of a woman's bus trip from Dallas to Washington to attend President
Kennedy's funeral. It takes it name from the Dallas airport where
the president landed on the morning of the assassination.
   Gay said Ms. Pfeiffer was driving a rented red Mitsubishi when
trooper R.C. Smith turned on his blue lights. Wilson is in central

school President James B. Holderman's lavish spending habits during
the last 1{ years at the school.
   ``If people think that I'm doing a disservice rather than a
service here, then definitely I want to take the effort _ because
it's a sincere effort _ elsewhere,'' said Benson, who has been
artist-in-residence at the school's College of Humanities and
Social Sciences since 1988.
   Benson said Monday he felt compelled to speak out since
questions were raised about his filming here of the newly released
movie, ``Modern Love,'' with the use of some of his students. He
said he was particularly disturbed by a recent letter to a
newspaper criticizing him.
   Eighty-nine South Carolinians were hired to work on the movie,
or four of five of all those hired, Benson said. Of those jobs, 39
were given to USC students and employees, he said.
   Benson lives here with his wife, singer Karla DeVito, and their
daughter, Lyric.

   Sylvester Stallone says the characters Rocky
and Rambo he has made famous are very different from his own nature.
   ``I am afraid of being identified with Rambo or Rocky,''
Stallone said Monday.
   But that's not slowing sequel production. A new installment of
Rocky, the fifth, is in the works and a fourth Rambo film is
planned, Stallone said.
   Stallone unveiled his plans while attending a television awards
ceremony. Stallone said the next installment of Rambo will deal
with ecology ``which is the most important problem at the moment.''

   Actress Victoria Principal filed suit against
CBS, claiming the network breached a contract concerning a
made-for-television movie in which she starred.
   She alleges CBS failed to honor a promise to pay her production
company $300,000 if the network decided not to make a weekly series
out of the movie ``Sparks.''
   ``CBS breached the `Sparks' agreement by failing and refusing to
pay the liquidation fee despite its decision not to order any
episodes of the series,'' according to the lawsuit filed Monday in
Los Angeles Superior Court by attorney Ralph Loeb.
   Susan Tick, publicity chief for CBS in Los Angeles, said she was
not aware of the lawsuit and could not comment about it.
   The TV movie, ``Sparks: The Price of Passion,'' aired on Feb. 25
and featured Miss Principal as the mayor of Albuquerque, N.M., at
odds with real estate developers over growth of the city.

   Actor Billy Barty was ordered to pay $428
to a television show writer who claimed he wasn't paid for creating
several comedy sketches.
   Burbank Municipal Court Commissioner Dennis H. Shanklin on
Monday granted the award to Warren Taylor for sketches he wrote for
``Short Ribbs,'' which aired last year on KDOC-TV in Anaheim and is
no longer in production.
   Taylor already was paid $800 for his work on the show, including
a satirical skit that featured Barty as a crooked judge.
   In a similar small claims dispute two months ago, Barty was
ordered to pay $1,300 to William Winckler, another writer on the
show that featured midgits and dwarfs.
   Taylor, Winckler and a third writer, Len Udes, told Shanklin
they were guaranteed $100 for every script they wrote, even if they
collaborated on sketches for the show.
   Barty, who has starred in such films as ``Rumpelstiltskin'' and
``Willow'' argued the writers didn't identify which scripts they
authored and said it was impossible to determine who should be paid.

<TEXT>
   A string of bullfighting arenas is being
built along Oman's northern coast to encourage the traditional
sport, which differs from the Western version in that bulls do all
the fighting.
   One arena is under construction at al-Miraisi in the Barka
region, about 55 miles from Muscat. Another will be at Sohar, 144
miles northwest of Muscat.
   Barka is famous for its desert bullfighting tradition, and
hundreds of people turn out to watch the spectacle on weekends and
holidays.
   In Omani bullfighting, there is no human participation. A
referee selects a pair of animals from among the scores of bulls
brought to the ring by farmers. The two bulls are pitted against
each other across a sandy arena with no barriers.
   Fans watch the action sitting on gravel piled around the ring.
   In a test of strength often lasting only a few mintues, the
beasts lock horns until one is forced to the ground. The victor
emerges with a higher price tag.
   ``The bulls do not get hurt,'' said Ali Hamdan, a fan of the
sport. ``The only thing damaged usually is the losing owner's
pride.''

   The United States hopes negotiations for a
chemical weapons pact with the Soviet Union can be concluded before
the summit between President Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev, the State
Department said Tuesday.
   Spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said a range of options were being
discussed, but she refused to comment on a Washington Times report
that the administration has offered to halt production of chemical
weapons by a specific date as part of a compromise.
   The negotiations are aimed at reaching a bilateral agreement to
reduce chemical weapons stocks in anticipation of a global ban on
the arms.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze will discuss the issue next week in
Moscow. The May 16-18 talks will lay the groundwork for Gorbachev's
five-day visit to Washington, which begins May 30.
   The Washington Times said in Tuesday editions that Baker has
offered to halt U.S. production of new gas weapons by a specified
date. That would be a shift from the previous position of ending
the manufacture only after a separate multinational treaty banning
such weapons went into effect.

   Americans can now order postage stamps by

   The U.S. Postal Service announced Tuesday that it has set up a
nationwide stamps-by-phone system, operating 24 hours every day.
   Customers can buy stamps using major credit cards by calling
1-800-782-6724, (1-800-STAMP-24).
   The agency tested the concept between 1987 and 1989. It has now
hired the Dallas-based firm, TMI Corp., to handle the operation.
   The system is expected to be most useful to small businesses,
but can also be important to the elderly, the handicapped, and
others for whom a trip to the post office can be difficult or
time-consuming.
   Stamps will be sold at face value plus a $3 service charge, per
order, and mailed to the buyer. They will be available in sheets of
50, rolls of 100 or 500 and booklets. The service also will sell
postal cards and stamped envelopes.

<TEXT>
   While Nelson Mandela was in
prison, he sent a lawyer to his wife's house to remove three men
who had been abducted there and beaten, a witness testified Tuesday
in a murder trial.
   Mandela's wife, Winnie, has not been charged in the case, which
went to trial one week ago. But two alleged victims have testified
that she was the first to beat them, using her fists and a whip.
Members of her bodyguard later joined in, according to testimony
Monday and Tuesday.
   James ``Stompie'' Seipei, a 14-year-old activist, was also
abducted and beaten with the men, the witnesses have said. He was
found dead in a field in January 1989 with a stab wound in the neck.
   Jerry Richardson, one of Mrs. Mandela's bodyguards who lived at
her home in the black township of Soweto, is accused of murdering
Seipei. He also is charged with four counts of kidnapping, five
counts of assault and one of attempted murder.
   One of the alleged beating victims, 20-year-old Barend Mono,
testified Tuesday. He said that it was Mrs. Mandela who began the
beatings after the four were abducted in December 1988 from a
Methodist Church home.
   Mrs. Mandela said last year she was not at home when the alleged
beatings took place, but she said the abductions were justified
because the men were engaged in homosexual activity with a minister
running the church home. The Methodist Church says it has
investigated and cleared the minister of the allegations.
   Mandela, deputy president of the African National Congress, has
made no comment on the case since he was freed in February from his
life prison term for sabotage and plotting the overthrow of the
white government.
   Mono said Mrs. Mandela's lawyer, Krish Naidoo, came to the house
where the men were held one day. Richardson instructed the men to
say they were not abducted but chose to leave the church home
because of homosexual activity, Mono told the court.
   The next day, Mandela's lawyer, Ismail Ayob, visited the house
and said ``he was told by Nelson Mandela to come and fetch us,''
Mono testified.
   He testified that eventually the three men were freed when they
were taken to the medical offices of Soweto community leader Nthato
Motlana.
   Richardson had taken the teen-ager, Seipei, away earlier, he
said.
   Leaders of major anti-apartheid organizations and Soweto
community leaders accused Mrs. Mandela early last year of
``complicity in the abductions and assault'' of the four, including
Seipei. They also said her bodyguards had waged a ``reign of
terror'' in Soweto, a black township outside Johannesburg.
   The anti-apartheid leaders called on the black community to shun
Mrs. Mandela. But a few months later, she began appearing at
rallies with other leaders.
   Since Mandela was freed, she has regularly appeared at his side
during public events.
   On Monday, another alleged victim, Kenneth Kgase, 30, testified
that Mrs. Mandela assaulted all four of the captives, punching and
whipping them and pulling their hair.
   In addition to Richardson, eight other bodyguards for Mrs.
Mandela face separate trials on lesser charges stemming from the
incident.

<HEAD>Watch Your Language: City Seeks Neuter Form for `Manhole'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A manhole by any other name could be a
``person entry,'' ``exit port'' or ``personhole,'' contestants say
in a tongue-in-cheek, city-sponsored bid to find the neuter form
for the scruffy iron fixture.
   Prompted by the sensitivity of the city council's female
majority to feminist issues, the Public Works Department called for
suggestions to replace the familiar appellation. Responses _ much
to the astonishment of city officials _ have come in from all over
the world.
   The winning synonym for Sacramento's 26,379 circular lids is
expected to be announced Wednesday night at a council meeting.
   ``The calls came in from everywhere,'' said Christine Olsen, a
city spokeswoman. ``But it's not really a formal contest. It's just
that some of our Public Works people had ideas for a change and it
got blown out of proportion.'' She said she had no estimate of the
number of entries.
   Many people are calling with ``lewd and offensive suggestions,''
and others angrily want to know about ``the women who are taking
over the city council,'' said a city receptionist. An employee at
the city sewer department, listed in the telephone directory under
``manhole covers,'' said the controversy ``has really had no effect
here. It's all over at the council.''
   Interest in the issue rose after city civil engineer Randy Witt
suggested at a council meeting last month that the city hold a
for-fun Manhole Terminology Change Contest to spur interest on the
engineering staff.
   One newspaper headline said the city was ``Blowing the lid off
sexist `manholes,''' while another proclaimed that a ```Tempest in
a Manhole' sweeps city.''
   A radio station in Hamilton, New Zealand _ Sacramento's sister
city _ held a renaming contest in which ``sewer viewer'' captured
the top prize. Other New Zealand nomenclature included
``peoplehole,'' ``peephole'' and ``underground service access (USA)
hole.''
   The nine-member city council has had a five-member female
majority since last fall's elections, including Mayor Anne Rudin,
who lauded the Public Works Department for ``keeping up with
contemporary standards.''
   But Olsen said the panel did not order any changes in the
terminology used by the department.
   ``We're all just kind of amazed,'' Olsen said. ``We've really
been getting a lot of calls, and they seem to think that the female
majority on the city council ordered the change to non-sexist
language. That's not true. Actually, somebody saw the term `manhole
covers' in an internal report and said, `Hey, maybe it's time we
made this change,' just for fun, and ask around and see if anybody
has any ideas on on what to call them,'' Olsen said.
   For years, Olsen added, many city workers have referred to the
2-foot-diameter lids as ``utility covers.''
   ``For decades, the Public Works Department employees were
largely male, so the department has been making a concerted effort
to have women participate in some of the non-traditional jobs,''
she said.
   ``It's not insignificant,'' said Deborah Franklin, a
fund-raising coordinator for the California chapter of the National
Organization for Women. ``We feel language is of importance. They
are not holes for men, they are holes for sewers.
   ``But if you suggest a change, immediately there is this uproar,
people saying, `Oh, those women. There they go again.' Some people
are threatened in something as simple as changing the names of
manhole covers.''

   At 30-something, Mona doesn't want to stay
in at night. She won't let just anyone do her pedicure. And since
she weighs 4 to 5 tons, nobody at the El Paso Zoo will argue with
her.
   ``When an elephant wants to go somewhere, I usually don't get in
the way,'' said Lea Hutchinson, the zoo administrator and
veterinarian.
   Mona, the zoo's senior resident, has always been headstrong. But
she's become particularly obstinate in recent weeks and Hutchinson
wants to bring Mona's former keeper, Rudy Romero, out of retirement
to retrain her.
   ``He's the one she grew up with,'' Hutchinson said. ``She's had
other keepers, but never developed the kind of rapport she had with
him. He walks in the gate of the zoo, and she knows he's here _
it's instant recognition.''
   Romero, 62, started working with Mona when she was shoulder-high
in the 1950s. He stayed on with the zoo until his retirement in
1983.
   Romero said that when he dropped by the zoo two weeks ago, Mona
became excited and began trumpeting as soon as he was on the
grounds.
   ``She remembered me right away,'' he said. ``It's kind of
embarrassing the way she acts.''

   Old spaghetti may sound cold and clammy, but two
restaurant chains thought it was hot enough to fight over it in
court.
   The Old Spaghetti Warehouse, based in suburban Garland, has
agreed to drop the word ``old'' from its corporate moniker and will
pay $400,000 to settle litigation brought by an ``older''
competitor of nearly the same name.
   About three years ago, the owner of a Portland, Ore.-based chain
called the Old Spaghetti Factory filed two lawsuits against the
Texas chain.
   The owner alleged that the Old Spaghetti Warehouse had stolen a
recipe using mytzithra cheese _ a Greek cheese made from goat's
milk _ and copied the use of trolleys as booths.
   On Monday, Old Spaghetti Warehouse announced it would scrap
``old'' from the signs on its stores and delete any mention of
mytzithra cheese from its menu. But the company, which denies
taking its competitor's sauce recipe, will continue to be able to
use the special cheese.
   ``We are pleased that the litigation is finally behind us,''
Robert Hawke, president of the 15-store, $28 million Texas company
said. ``This removes a cloud over our future and will allow us to
proceed with our franchise plans.''
   Old Spaghetti Warehouse opened its first restaurant in Dallas in
1972 and has since opened 14 other company-owned stores in eight
states. The company went public in 1985.
   The Old Spaghetti Factory chain was established in 1970 and has
28 stores. The lawsuits settled Monday were filed in federal court
in Atlanta, the only market in which both companies have stores.

<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh denied
Tuesday that he has abandoned support for tougher penalties for
white-collar criminals and promised strong recommendations on the
subject after it receives more study.
   ``I stand second to none in pressing for nothing less than the
maximum penalties that we can accommodate under the law'' for
corporate offenders, Thornburgh told the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   He said toughened sentencing guidelines that were withdrawn
recently remain under study and could be reissued later.
   Thornburgh has made cracking down on ``crime in the suites'' a
theme of his rule at the Justice Department. But last month his
aides acknowledged that he withdrew the proposed sentencing
guidelines at White House request.
   The administration reportedly acted after an intense lobbying
campaign by defense contractors, oil companies and others that
envisioned the proposals as something resembling a ``corporate
death penalty'' for a number of firms.
   The guidelines produced by the U.S. Sentencing Commission were
revealed last fall. They would require stiff mandatory fines on
companies convicted of polluting, fraud and other white-collar
offenses.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said that when the guidelines
were withdrawn he was ``concerned that the Department of Justice
has surrendered so easily to pressure from the White House and big
business to go soft on white-collar crime.''
   Thornburgh said the department does ``not repudiate the proposed
corporate sentencing guidelines,'' but that the recommendations had
not been given adequate review. He said they are ``now being given
that review'' with an eye toward eventually issuing something
similar.
   He said there was no deadline for issuing guidelines on
corporate penalties but promised that he would make his
recommendations public at some point. ``I favor strong penalties
against white-collar criminals,'' Thornburgh said.
   Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, however, complained that
white-collar offenders are too often staying out of jail. ``Your
prosecutors are wheeling and dealing constantly without anyone
going to the slammer,'' he said.
   But Thornburgh said: ``I think you'd have a hard time explaining
that to Woody Lemons.'' Lemons, the former chairman of a Texas
savings and loan, was recently sentenced to 30 years in prison, the
stiffest sentence so far in the probe of massive fraud in the
thrift industry.
   Metzenbaum persisted, however, urging the attorney general to
impress government disapproval of corporate fraud on ``the country
club set.''
   Thornburgh promised to get Metzenbaum a list of white-collar
offenders who have been sentenced to prison. ``I will hope to
disabuse you of what is obviously a mistaken view,'' he said.

   North Carolina Democrats on Tuesday
narrowed a crowded field of candidates hoping to take on Sen. Jesse
Helms, and a 100-year-old eye doctor made a bid for Congress in a
Republican primary.
   Helms, the outspoken conservative who is seeking a fourth term,
had token primary opposition from Charlotte businessman George
Wimbish and retired New Bern contractor L.C. Nixon.
   In the six-way Democratic primary, Harvey Gantt, the black
former mayor of Charlotte, emerged as the leader in late polls but
needed to win more than 40 percent of the vote to avoid a June 5
runoff. The three other top contenders were John Ingram, a former
state insurance commissioner; Michael Easley, district attorney in
Brunswick County; and R.P. ``Bo'' Thomas, a former state senator.
   In a 3rd District congressional race, Henry Merritt Stenhouse, a
Goldsboro ophthalmologist who still keeps office hours three days a
week, ran on a ``less government'' platform against businessman Don
Davis, 60, and oil heater repairman Ken Brosman, 39.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The winner of the 3rd District primary will take on Democratic
Rep. Martin Lancaster. No Republican has been elected from that
district since Reconstruction.
   In the closing days of the Senate campaign, Gantt appealed for
party unity and said a divisive primary runoff would hurt chances
of unseating Helms in November.
   No black candidate has been nominated for the Senate in North
Carolina since 1914, when popular election of senators began in the
state.
   Easley and Thomas sniped at each other in television ads and in
public, each demanding apologies for what they said was distortion
of their records. Thomas was under fire from Easley and other
Democrats for vulgar remarks made about women and past state
leaders. Thomas said Easley plea-bargained drug cases instead of
prosecuting them.

<HEAD>Man Who Abandoned Son at Rest Stop Sentenced to 40 Years for
Assault</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who abandoned his emaciated, battered
7-year-old son at a freeway rest stop has been sentenced to 40
years in prison for four counts of second-degree assault involving
the boy.
   Sadism ``fits more aptly than any other term I can think of'' to
describe the behavior of Edward Donald Tuinman, 30, said Yakima
County Superior Court Judge Bruce Hanson.
   The judge reserved judgment Monday on whether the sentence would
run concurrently with a 10-year term for abandonment in Idaho.
   The earlier sentence stemmed from the discovery of Ed ``Little
Eddy'' Tuinman, emaciated, battered and burned by cigarettes, at a
rest stop on Interstate 84 near Boise on Jan. 4, 1989. Authorities
said the boy, who is mute and retarded, was abandoned while
Tuinman, his wife and their other children were moving from
Washington state to Arizona.
   Tuinman's wife, Deborah, was not charged because authorities
said she also had been abused by him.
   Defense lawyer Rick Hoffman said the exceptional sentence, 10
years on each count to run consecutively, would be appealed. The
standard sentencing range for each assault count is 43 to 53
months, Hoffman said.
   Deputy prosecutor Steve Keller recommended the 40-year sentence
for charges covering four types of abuse _ shooting the boy with
BBs from an air gun, holding a hunting knife to the boy and poking
the tip into his feet and legs, choking and hitting the boy, and
burning him with cigarettes.
   Tuinman pleaded guilty and asked to be forgiven by the court,
his family and Eddy.
   ``It hurts down inside me,'' he sobbed. ``I can't believe it
happened.''
   He hung his head while the judge viewed a videotape of a cabin
the Tuinmans occupied in nearby Buena. The tape showed blood
stains, dents where the child was thrown against plasterboard, BBs
embedded in the wall and cords used to tie the boy to his bed at
night.
   ``We don't often see cases where children are repeatedly and
consistently and ... sadistically abused in the manner Ed Junior
was,'' said sheriff's detective Rose Roberson. ``Our outlook of the
human race has been jaded just a bit by what we've seen.''
   Other children in the family were forced to join in beating
their brother, Roberson said.
   The elder Tuinman was abused as a child and may have suffered
brain damage from three head injuries, so he ``did not have all
things working properly for him,'' Hoffman said.
   Since being placed with a family in the Boise area, the little
boy has gained weight and is walking and feeding himself, Roberson
said.

   Postal service finances have perked up a bit,
but an official said Tuesday that a loss of up to $1.5 billion is
likely by the end of the fiscal year.
   The U.S. Postal Service said it had net income of $370 million
in the first half of fiscal 1990, which began Sept. 1.
   That's $289 million better than had been expected for the period.
   Postmaster General Anthony Frank told the agency's board of
governors that an increase in the productivity of postal workers
and lower than expected transportation costs led to the savings.
   Mail volume also increased slightly, bringing in more money.
   Senior Assistant Postmaster General Comer S. Coppie said a
cost-of-living increase for postal workers was due this month and
that other costs were rising.
   Overall, Coppie said, the agency is likely to finish the fiscal
year with a loss of between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion.
   The postal service already has filed for a rate increase,
including a boost to 30 cents for first-class stamps. If approved,
that's likely to take effect early next year.

   The reputed mentor of a group holding two
U.S. hostages said Tuesday he fears that a Western captive could be
executed if rumors are true that four long-missing Iranians are
dead.
   ``If the death of the four Iranians is ascertained, that will
definitely affect the hostage issue,'' said Hussein Musawi, a
Shiite Moslem fundamentalist. ``One of the kidnap groups might
react by murdering a hostage.''
   ``I don't have any concrete information on that,'' Musawi said
by telephone from his headquarters in the east Lebanon city of
Baalbek. ``But they have done it before. What's there to stop them
from doing it again?''
   The four Iranians were seized by right-wing Lebanese Forces
militiamen north of Beirut in July 1982. They are widely believed
to have been killed either in civil-war shelling or by their
captors.
   In a separate interview with the Communist-run Voice of the
People radio station, Musawi did not specifically rule out further
releases. But he said he did not expect the hostage issue to be
settled this year because the United States has made no
conciliatory gesture following the release of two Americans last
month.
   ``This issue has turned into a very complicated one because of
the negative U.S. stand ... The hostage issue will be frozen for a
certain period of time,'' he added.
   Musawi heads Islamic Amal, a pro-Syrian faction in the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God. Hezbollah is believed to
be the umbrella for Shiite extremists holding most of the 16
Westerners missing in Lebanon. The hostages include six Americans.
The captive held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   Musawi also is the reputed mentor of the pro-Iranian Islamic
Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine, the group that freed U.S.
educator Robert Polhill on April 22 after 39 months in captivity.
   The move was followed by the Organization of Islamic Dawn's
April 30 release of another American, Frank Reed, after 43 months
as a hostage.
   The kidnappers and Iranian officials have asked that the fate of
the four Iranians be determined. President Bush has said the United
States could try to help account for them, and he publicy thanked
Iran and Syria for helping secure the freedom of Polhill and Reed.
   Musawi said those who wield influence over the hostage-holders,
especially Iran, will resume their efforts when ``positive
indications appear from the West.''
   But White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater reiterated Monday
that the United States will make no deals for the release of the
hostages.
   ``You cannot let terrorists think they can steal American
citizens and beat them up and just steal more and more and more and
more,'' he said.
   Musawi told the AP he believes no more hostages will be freed
before Israel and its militia allies in Lebanon free some 400
Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners, another key demand made by the
kidnappers and Tehran.
   ``And I think they won't,'' he said. ``If the Americans want to
solve the hostage issue, they should solve the problem of the
Moslems and oppressed held by Israel and its surrogates.''
   There has been growing pressure on Israel to free its Arab
detainees to help win freedom for the hostages.
   Israel says it is not opposed to a swap in principle, but that
such an exchange should include three Israeli servicemen captured
in Lebanon in 1986 and believed held by radical Shiites linked to
the pro-Iranian Hezbollah militia.
   Gen. Antoine Lahad, commander of the Israeli-backed South
Lebanon Army, said Monday he will not release any of the 300 Shiite
prisoners his group holds unless efforts are made to free
militiamen and Israeli soldiers held by Shiite groups.

<HEAD>Survey: Tehran World's Most Expensive City</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tehran is the world's most expensive city in
dollar terms, costing nearly twice as much as it does to live in
New York, according to a survey of 83 cities published Tuesday.
   Despite high levels of inflation, the continual decline of many
currencies in Latin American countries has ensured they remain
financially attractive to expatriates. Quito, the capital of
Ecuador, ranks as the cheapest city, according to the survey
published by a private Geneva-based research and consultancy
organization, Corporate Resources Group.
   Taking New York as the base of 100 and using the dollar exchange
rate of April 9, the survey showed Tehran has a cost-of-living
index of 192. It said an overvalued currency was the main reason
the Iranian capital proved so expensive.
   By contrast, the steady decline of the Japanese yen since the
middle of last year helped bring down the costs of living in Japan
in comparison with other countries, the survey said.
   It said Tokyo, frequently the most expensive city in previous
international surveys, was the second-most-expensive city with a
cost-of-living index of 150. Osaka stands at 133.
   The Gabon capital, Libreville in West Africa, has an index of
143, it said.
   The Norwegian capital Oslo, with an index of 135, ranks top of
the European league and fifth overall. Helsinki, in Finland, is
rated at 130, it said.
   It said the world's ``bargain locations'' were in North and
South America. Only Toronto, with an index of 101, is more
expensive in dollar terms than New York. Other ratings included
Chicago at 96; Washington, D.C., 95; Los Angeles, 94; San Francisco
and Boston, 93; Houston and Miami, 92; and Cleveland, 88.
   It said Quito had an index of 40, the lowest of the cities
surveyed.
   The study was based on a basket of 151 products including food
consumed at home, alcohol, tobacco, clothing, transport, sports and
leisure, but not housing.
   It is aimed at helping international companies determine
cost-of-living differentials for their expatriate employees.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After performing ``God Bless America'' before
enthusiastic Muscovites outside a hotel near the Kremlin, members
of an American Legion band were looking forward Tuesday to marching
through Red Square itself.
   But Dorothy Hill, 74, the leader of the band from Waltham,
Mass., said the musicians have already accomplished their main
mission _ promoting peace, understanding and togetherness between
the Soviet and American people.
   Mrs. Hill single-handedly spent three years working her way
through the Soviet bureaucracy to bring the 70-member, all-male
band to Moscow as a ``peace move'' between the superpowers.
   On Wednesday, the Joseph P. Hill American Legion Band, named
after Mrs. Hill's late husband, will become the first American band
to march in Moscow's annual Victory Day parade, commemorating the
defeat of Nazi Germany.
   The band's members range in age from 17 to 82, and include
veterans of World War II, Korea and Vietnam.
   The band began its 10-day trip on Saturday, and already there
have been some emotional moments, particularly two impromptu
concerts Sunday and Monday outside the Hotel Rossiya across from
the Kremlin.
   The band played ``God Bless America,'' the U.S. and Soviet
national anthems, and other patriotic tunes. And soon, curious
Soviets _ including some bemedaled World War II veterans _ were
clapping, dancing and singing along.
   ``It was one of the most emotional times of my life,'' said Mrs.
Hill, speaking in her thick Boston accent. ``The people there
watching and listening were shedding tears, we were shedding tears.
   ``It proved my point right there _ that reaction of your people
and our people _ that peace is possible,'' Mrs. Hill told a news
conference at the headquarters of the Soviet Peace Committee.
``People. Togetherness. And we've seen it the last couple of
nights.''
   Mrs. Hill, a World War II Coast Guard veteran, began planning
the trip after having a dream ``that we should never see another
war.''
   With no Soviet contacts, she used charm and persistence, staying
up through the night to dial telephone operators in Moscow to find
someone to contact.
   Finally, one operator put her in touch with the Soviet Peace
Committee, ``and once we got them, the show was on the road,'' she
said.
   At a ceremony Tuesday, Soviet Peace Committee Chairman Genrik
Borovik praised Mrs. Hill as a ``remarkable, wonderful woman.''
   ``I'm happy that she broke American bureaucracy and Soviet
bureaucracy,'' said Borovik, who as a television commentator often
criticized U.S. foreign policy before Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to
power.
   Borovik called the band's presence unusual, because of the
American Legion's reputation as a right-wing organization, ``which
was always, let me say, not the best friend of the Soviet Union.''
   John ``Jake'' Comer of Quincy, Mass., a past American Legion
national commander, said the tears ``just came out of my eyes'' as
the band played ``God Bless America'' and he held the Soviet and
American flags during the impromptu concerts.
   ``I've been to 18 countries ..., had an audience with the pope,
visited the Oval Office with Presidents Reagan, Bush,'' he said.
``I've done everything, but nothing as moving as that.''
   Mrs. Hill said she didn't always have warm feelings toward the
Soviet Union, recalling the Cold War.
   ``I was as bad as everbody was in those days. `The Communists _
what are they doing to us?' and so forth,'' she said. Now, however,
``We love 'em. We love 'em. We had the opportunity as people to
prove it.''

   The Florida Lottery wants to be the
nation's first to market its games overseas by selling tickets in
the Caribbean and Central and South America.
   Officials from the Caribbean, Central America and South America
have asked Florida to open ticket outlets in their countries and
let them keep some of the profits. Lottery officials declined to
identify the nations involved.
   Those foreign officials also hope to stop ticket bootlegging
that makes money for foreign scalpers but nothing for the
governments.
   In exchange, Florida would get an enormous base of new lottery
players, bigger jackpots and ultimately more money for its public
schools. On Monday, state lawmakers OK'd the lottery's study of
proposed international sales.
   Federal law bars selling lottery tickets by mail or importing
tickets from other countries, but is vague on selling U.S. tickets
overseas and doesn't address Florida's ticket-selling over
telephone lines through computers.
   New Hampshire also is negotiating with an unidentified country
in the Far East for lottery sales, said that state's lottery
director, James Wimpsatt.

<HEAD>More New Mothers Getting Paid Leave; Fewer Quitting Jobs</HEAD>
<NOTE>For Release 6:30 p.m. EDT</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The share of first-time mothers receiving paid
maternity leave has nearly tripled in recent years, while only half
as many have quit their jobs, the Census Bureau said Tuesday.
   More than 60 percent of new mothers quit working from 1961
through 1965, while only 28 percent did so from 1981 through 1985.
   On the other hand, almost half received paid maternity leave in
the second survey period, up from 16 percent in the first.
   While the study, ``Work and Family Patterns of American Women,''
includes data only through 1985, it does show historical trends
starting in the 1960s.
   The report was released as Congress is considering a bill that
would require employers with 50 or more workers to offer unpaid
time off, with job and benefit protection, for the care of newborn,
newly adopted or seriously ill children, as well as to deal with
personal health problems or ill spouses or parents.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President Bush urges
companies to provide paid parental leaves voluntarily but is
unwilling to force them to do it.
   The report comes just a day after the National Center for Health
Statistics reported that the increase in births in recent years
continued into 1989 with 4,021,000 births, up from 3,913,000 a year
earlier.
   Births have risen steadily in recent years as the giant Baby
Boom generation passed through its prime childbearing years.
   Although this has resulted in an increase in the actual number
of births, birth rates remain well below those of the Baby Boom era
of the 1950s and early 1960s.
   The Census report found that younger women are more likely to
quit their jobs or to be fired when they become pregnant than are
older mothers.
   From the ages of 18 to 22, 43 percent of new mothers left work,
while only 20 percent of those having a first child at age 25 and
over left their jobs.
   Overall, 63 percent of women having their first children from
1961 to 1965 did not return to work, the study said. That fell to
51 percent in the 1971-75 period and 28 percent from 1981 through
1985.
   Those receiving paid maternity or sick leave when having their
first baby totaled only 16 percent in the early 1960s. By the first
half of the 1970s, it was 23 percent and, in the first half of the
1980s, 47 percent.
   The share of women receiving unpaid leave _ meaning they were
promised a job on their return from maternity leave _ rose from 14
percent in the early 1060s to 21 percent in the 1970s, then slipped
to 20 percent in the 1980s.
   The share fired from their jobs was nearly constant, 5.0 percent
in the early 1960s and 4.6 percent in the later periods.
   In the early 1960s, 2.7 percent of first-time mothers said they
never stopped working. That dipped to 1.7 percent in the early
1970s but rose to 2.8 percent in the early 1980s.

   Prosecutors have refused to charge Todd
Bridges with possession of drugs and decided instead to file felony
drug charges against a friend who was arrested with the star of
``Diff'rent Strokes.''
   Bridges, 24, who has had numerous run-ins with the law, and
Steve Mallen, 36, were arrested early Saturday after police
allegedly found 2 ounces of cocaine in their car.
   ``We are rejecting the case against (Bridges) because, after
evaluation, it's rather clear there is insufficient evidence to
show he had any control of the substance,'' Deputy District
Attorney Norm Shapiro said Tuesday.
   Mallen was charged with possession of cocaine for sale.
   Bridges was jailed until Tuesday in lieu of $25,000 bail.
   Bridges faces retrial July 30 on a charge stemming from the
February 1989 wounding of Kenneth ``Tex'' Clay, who was shot eight
times at a crack house.
   A jury last year acquitted Bridges of attempted murder and
attempted involuntary manslaughter in the case. Jurors deadlocked
on assault with a deadly weapon and the charge was refiled. Bridges
has pleaded innocent.
   A conviction could bring six years in prison.

<HEAD>Du Pont Heir Who Wanted to Give Money to LaRouche Says He's
Competent</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A du Pont family heir who has been
declared incompetent to handle his financial affairs testified
Tuesday his family has ``used the court to control me'' because of
his donations to Lyndon LaRouche.
   Lewis du Pont Smith, 33, is trying to overturn a court order
that limits his spending from a $10 million trust set up by his
grandfather to $15,000 a month. He said the order ``offends my
dignity.''
   Smith, an independent candidate for Congress from suburban
Philadelphia running on the extremist political platform of
LaRouche, testified he is ``very upset, even angry, that my family
has continued this action for so long.''
   Smith's parents went to court at the end of 1985 after their son
gave LaRouche $212,000. Since then, LaRouche has been convicted of
conspiracy, mail fraud and income tax charges and is serving a
15-year federal prison sentence.
   ``I don't think my family has respected my right to disagree
with them,'' Smith said.
   Chester County Common Pleas Judge Lawrence Wood, in declaring
Smith incompetent, relied on psychiatrists' opinions. More
psychiatric testimony is expected during the hearing.
   ``Foolishness is not mental illness,'' said Dr. Richard
Lonsdorf, a psychiatrist brought in by Smith's attorney. If a
person has a minimal capacity to understand what he is doing, he
shouldn't be declared incompetent, he said. Smith testified he
bought a house in Leesburg, Va., and sold it for a $40,000 profit.
He also said he bought a $15,000 Cadillac and leased a home in New
Hampshire where two years ago he ran unsuccessfully for Congress.
   He said he has worked closely with the Wilmington (Del.) Trust
Co., trustee for his estate, and persuaded it to make changes in
the investments.
   He said he has never been influenced by LaRouche, that LaRouche
has never asked him for money, and that he works for organizations
connected with LaRouche because he believes in what he is doing.

   Rain and sodden fields are hampering many
farmers as they try to plant corn and other crops this spring, the
government's Joint Agricultural Weather Facility said Tuesday.
   Nationally, corn planting was reported 50 percent complete,
trailing normal progress by three percentage points. Cotton
planting was 39 percent completed, down five points from the usual
pace for this time.
   But corn producers in Iowa, Nebraska and Ohio were able to make
up for earlier delays, planting about one-third of their acreage
during the week of April 30-May 6.
   ``Rain slowed planting in Kentucky and Missouri,'' the report
said. ``Planting lagged 41 points behind the 76 percent average in
Missouri. Plant ing also lagged behind normal in Illinois and
Colorado.''
   Cotton farmers were held up by rain and wet fields in Arkansas,
Missouri, Tennessee and Texas.
   However, cotton planting ``progressed rapidly'' in Georgia,
Louisiana, Mississippi and the Carolinas, and was nearly finished
in Arizona and California, the report said.
   Winter wheat was generally in ``good to fair'' condition, with
23 percent of the crop inn place, six percentage points behind the
five-year average.
   Planting of spring wheat for this year's harvest was 75 percent
completed, 10 points ahead of the normal pace, the report said.
Seeding was complete in South Dakota and almost finished in Idaho.
Planting was 62 percent completed in North Dakota, three percentage
points ahead of normal.

<HEAD>Moammar Gadhafi Says He Considered Missile Attack on U.S. Base</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi said he
considered attacking a U.S. military base on the Greek island of
Crete with missiles if American planes had resumed bombing Libya in
1986, a newspaper said.
   The idea was dropped because of close Libyan-Greek relations and
the danger to civilians, Gadhafi was quoted as telling an
international peace conference Saturday.
   Gadhafi gave a ``fiery'' 35-minute speech via satellite to the
International Conference for Peace in the Mediterranean in
Ierapetra on Crete last weekend, the newspaper Eleftherotypia said
Monday.
   The United States maintains two bases on the Mediterranean
island _ an air force communications station near Iraklion, eastern
Crete, and a supply depot for the 6th Fleet at Suda Bay.
   The Navy base on the western tip of Crete, about 500 miles from
the Libyan capital of Tripoli, is within range of Libyan missiles,
military analysts said. Former socialist Premier Andreas
Papandreou, who governed Greece from 1981-89, maintained close ties
with Third World leaders and had praised Gadhafi for his
anti-American rhetoric.
   In his speech, Gadhafi said U.S. intentions to close the naval
communications station near the Greek capital were a welcome move.
   ``The fact that the (U.S.) base at Nea Makri is closing gladdens
us especially and we hope the same will happen with the U.S. base
at Lampedusa in Italy,'' he said.
   Lampedusa, which houses a U.S. Coast Guard base, came under
Libyan rocket attack in April 1986 after U.S. planes bombed
Tripoli, but the rockets fell into the sea far short of their mark.
   As part of a worldwide austerity plan, the United States has
announced it will close the U.S. Air Force base adjacent to Athens
International Airport. The closing of the two bases will leave the
two on Crete and 20 small units in various parts of Greece.
   The three-day conference was attended mostly by leftist-oriented
participants who called for a denuclearized Mediterranean and an
end to foreign bases and fleets in the region.

<HEAD>Zoo to Mate Again Rare Tiger That Strangled Cub</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zoo officials say they will again mate a rare
Sumatran tiger that apparently accidentally strangled her
2-month-old cub while zoo visitors watched in horror.
   ``It even occurs in the wild. The mother doesn't usually kill
the cub intentionally _ just through accident or neglect,'' said
Ronald Tilson, the Minnesota Zoo's director of conservation, who
studies Asian tigers.
   The cub, named Shere-Kahn, died Sunday at the Lowry Park Zoo
after the mother, Tuka, apparently picked him up wrong. Her jaws
nearly surrounded the cub's neck, cutting off his air supply. An
autopsy showed the cub died because his windpipe was blocked, said
David Thompson, zoo director.
   Shere-Kahn was Tuka's first offspring and zoo personnel
attributed the death to her lack of experience as a mother.
   Shere-Kahn was the first Sumatran tiger born in captivity in the
United States this year. Now, 32 of the rare orange and black
striped animals live in captivity in this country. An estimated 600
to 800 exist in the wild, only on the Indonesian island of Sumatra.
   Zoo officials said they would breed the 11-year-old Tuka again,
but they're considering hand-raising the next litter.
   Witnesses told curator Lex Salibsury that Tuka and Shere-Kahn
were frolicking in a moat when the 150-pound adult cat grabbed her
16-pound cub by the throat, then dragged it through the water.
   Zoo keepers lured Tuka into a cage and grabbed the unconscious
cub, and tried unsuccessfully to revive it with mouth-to-mouth
resusciation.
   ``It was very sad. People were just sobbing,'' said Michael
Hoad, who was visiting the park when it happened.
   The incident prompted zoo keepers to start monitoring another
new mother, Kariz, a Persian leopard who gave birth to three cubs
on March 6.

   The assistant manager of a movie
complex was kidnapped and shot in the throat, leaving him paralyzed
from the chest down, in a robbery that police said netted $1.
   Oscar Zarruck, 19, of San Francisco, was left to die on the
shore of the Oakland Estuary about five miles from the movie
complex, where he was discovered Saturday afternoon by the Coast
Guard.
   Police said Charles Bell, 19, of Oakland, was arrested the next
day, driving Zarruck's car and wearing a movie promotion button
taken from Zarruck's shirt.
   Police Sgt. Bill Gillespie said Bell plotted the robbery for
weeks, anticipating a large haul.
   He spent Friday night in the theater and surprised Zarruck when
he arrived for work Saturday morning, ordering him to open the
safe, Gillespie said.
   Zarruck stalled until other employees arrived, but Bell forced
him, with a hidden gun, to get into his own car and drive around
Oakland, the sergeant said.
   The other employees did not know what was happening.
   Bell shot Zarruck and took his wallet, which contained $1,
Gillespie said.

   Jim Davis, creator of fat cat ``Garfield,'' has
been named Cartoonist of the Year for 1990 by the National
Cartoonists Society.
   After six years as a nominee, Davis, of Albany, Ind., won the
``Reuben'' _ the cartoon world's equivalent of the Oscar _ for the
cynical, overfed Garfield, featured on television specials and many
novelty items as well as newspaper cartoons.
   The award was presented aboard the MS Sunward II in the
Caribbean during the weekend, said Selma Gore, spokeswoman for
Norwegian Cruise Lines.
   The award, a 16-inch bronze statue designed by the late
cartoonist Rube Goldberg, founder of the 44-year-old society, shows
eight people tangled together around an inkstand.
   Awards for excellence also were given in five categories. Johnny
Hart of Endicott, N.Y., who draws ``B.C.'' and ``Wizard of Id,''

<HEAD>Taiwan Removes Welcome Mat for Goddess of Democracy Radio Ship</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By Shirley Lai</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government pulled up the welcome mat
Tuesday for the Goddess of Democracy radio ship, saying it would
not be allowed to broadcast pro-democracy messages to China from
Taiwanese waters.
   Government spokesman Shaw Yu-ming urged the radio ship to
observe international laws that ban unauthorized broadcasts.
   ``The government has not and will not become involved in the
operation'' of the radio ship, Shaw said.
   Shaw made his remarks after top government officials met to
discuss how to handle the touchy problems raised by the radio ship.
   The Chinese government has warned that any help provided by
Taiwan for the ship would be considered ``an open provocation.''
   The ship's presence could jeopardize a recent thaw in the
historically chilly relations between Taipei and the Communist
government in Beijing. Tensions across the 100-mile Taiwan Strait
have eased, marked by increased trade and travel between the two
countries in recent years.
   The ship's spokesman, Xu Tianfang, said the Goddess of Democracy
was scheduled to arrive in the northern Taiwanese port of Keelung
on Friday to refuel and take on provisions before heading to
international waters to begin broadcasts.
   Xu, deputy secretary of the Paris-based Boat for China
Foundation, the ship's main organizer, said the ship's agent would
apply for a port entry permit.
   The government has not received any applications from the ship,
Shaw said.
   ``If that happens, we will make proper decisions based on
humanitarianism, international practices and domestic laws,'' he
said, without specifying whether the ship would be allowed into
Keelung.
   The Communications Ministry has said the ship would be allowed
to dock in Keelung unless the government issues instructions to the
contrary.
   Wang Shih-hsiung, an independent legislator, said he has
organized a flotilla of Taiwanese fishing boats to form a ``boat
wall'' to escort the radio ship into Keelung.
   Xu said the ship's sponsors have dropped plans to have leading
exiled Chinese dissidents board the ship in Keelung to make the
broadcasts.
   But he would not rule out the possibility that at least one
prominent dissident, Yan Jiaqi, might join in the broadcasts if he
chooses to do so.
   Yan, chairman of the Federation for a Democratic China, a
Paris-based Chinese dissident organization, arrived in Taipei
Monday for a weeklong visit.
   Yan, a professor and former member of China's top think tank,
fled China last June following the bloody crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
   The 1,200-ton Goddess of Democracy sailed from France March 17
for international waters off the Chinese coast, from where it plans
to broadcast music, news and pro-democracy messages to the mainland.
   The Chinese government has refused to rule out the use of force
to stop the planned broadcasts.
   The Goddess of Democracy took on provisions last week in
Singapore, but Hong Kong refused to allow the ship to enter its
waters. Officials in the British crown colony are sensitive about
relations with China, which is scheduled to take over Hong Kong in
1997.
   The ship is sponsored by a coalition of press organizations
headed by the French news magazine Actuel, with the cooperation of
the Federation for a Democratic China.
   The Goddess of Democracy is named after the statue erected by
pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square last May. It was
destroyed during the June 4 military crackdown that left hundreds,
perhaps thousands, of demonstrators dead.
   The Nationalist Chinese government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after
losing a civil war to Communist forces in mainland China.

   The International Press Institute said
Tuesday it would ask the United States, Britain and U.N.
organizations to step up efforts to get journalists held hostage in
Lebanon freed.
   Institute director Peter Gallinor noted in a speech that five
years had elapsed since the kidnapping of Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, and British
journalist John McCarthy.
   ``We will send messages from this assembly to U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, UNESCO and the
governments of the United States and Britain asking them to
increase their efforts in getting (the hostages) released,''
Gallinor said.
   He said there was hope U.N. organizations might achieve what
others have not been able to do.
   Two American hostages were recently set free, but six other
Americans are still in captivity along with 10 other Westerners.
The hostage held longest is Anderson, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

   Three young men who spray-painted
``Hitler is Back'' on a high school wall were ordered Tuesday to
learn about the Holocaust by a judge who noted it was the
anniversary of V-E Day.
   Westchester County Judge John Carey ordered the men to return to
court June 25 for a quiz on their history lesson. He also sentenced
them to weekly tours at a hospice for the terminally ill.
   ``I don't wish to punish any of you,'' Carey said. ``I wish to
educate you.''
   Michael Morano, 18, Michael Venturino, 18, and Neville Anthony
Mason, 20, all of Ardsley, were charged with spray-painting
swastikas and writing the words ``Jew,'' and ``Hitler is Back'' on
the walls of Ardsley High School on June 20, 1989.
   Morano, who pleaded guilty to a felony criminal mischief charge,
admitted doing the actual spray-painting. A high school dropout, he
told the judge he learned about Hitler and the war from television
and movies.
   Venturino, who drove the three to the school, and Mason, who
provided the paint, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor criminal mischief
charges.
   Before sentencing the young men, Carey told them that Tuesday
was the 45th anniversary of V-E Day, the day World War II ended in
Europe, saying the sentencing occurs ``in an historical context.''
   He then read about the treatment of Jews by Adolf Hitler _ from
William Shirer's ``The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,'' James
Michener's ``Poland,'' and a pamphlet about a concentration camp in
southern Poland the judge visited five years ago.
   ``I wish as part of your sentence, I could sentence you to go to
the Majdanek concentration camp,'' the judge said. ``It's a
terrible place.''
   As he went through the pamphlet, discussing the horrors of the
gas chambers and brutal experiments on small children, he added
several times, ``This is what your Hitler did.''
   Carey, whose brother was killed in the war, read in the Michener
book that in one day alone, 18,000 Jews were killed at a single
concentration camp.
   ``That's more than the population of Ardsley killed in one
day,'' Carey said of the New York City suburb. ``What had they
done? What were they guilty of?''
   If the three fail to pass the quiz, the judge could give them
the exam again later or consider it a violation of probation and
resentence them.
   Dr. Evan Bellin of the American Jewish Congress' committee on
anti-Semitism for Westchester County, said ``Justice was served''
by the judge's sensitivity.

   The Soviet Union's chief arms control adviser
said Tuesday that continued U.S. opposition to naval arms talks
could damage superpower ties.
   ``We think that this policy is unjust and aimed at undermining
security and gaining military superiority over the Soviet Union,''
Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev said of the American refusal to negotiate
over a ban on short-range nuclear weapons in the superpower navies.
   Akhromeyev made the comments in his first appearance before a
Senate Armed Services subcommittee and his second trip before a
congressional panel in less than a year.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's principal arms control adviser
and a member of the Supreme Soviet, Akhromeyev said U.S. opposition
to naval arms talks could jeopardize significant cuts in armed
forces and weapons down the road.
   ``We consider that sooner or later if we do not want to stop the
negotiations on reduction of nuclear and conventional arms, naval
forces cuts negotiations are unavoidable,'' said Akhromeyev.
   He also said the issue of whether the Soviets should give up
their SS-24 nuclear missile if the United States gives up the
multiple-warhead MX missile on railroad cars should be addressed in
talks once a treaty to reduce strategic weapons by 50 percent is
signed.
   ``It would be good if experts of our countries in this issue ...
really studied this prior to getting into those future
negotiations. That issue is already on the agenda of the day,''
Akhromeyev said.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the projection forces
and regional defense subcommittee, invited Akhromeyev to appear
before the panel to discuss naval arms reductions.
   In a new wrinkle to U.S.-Soviet relations, Akhromeyev said his
country would be willing to include land-based Soviet aircraft used
to protect its naval forces in talks on banning the navies'
short-range nuclear weapons.
   ``We think that nuclear weapons of all kinds of systems at sea
should be the subject of negotiations,'' Akhromeyev said. ``In
other words, the nuclear systems which are deployed on aircraft
carriers, on submarines and on aviation.''
   At the Malta summit last December, Gorbachev pressed President
Bush on such talks and on limiting submarine-launched cruised
missiles.
   Bush rejected Gorbachev's call for naval arms talks, arguing
that the United States is a naval power.
   And members of the Senate subcommittee raised serious doubts
about imposing limitations on U.S. naval forces.
   ``I am opposed to limiting the qualitative or quantitative naval
forces,'' said Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on
the committee and a former secretary of the Navy.
   Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, said any reduction in the United
States' access to sea lanes is ``tantamount to losing oxygen to our
lungs,'' and added the arms control agenda is already overloaded.
   On another issue, Akhromeyev said the Soviet Union did not
violate the U.S.-Soviet agreement in December 1987 to eliminate
short-range nuclear weapons even though some SS-23s have been found
in East Germany, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia.
   Akhromeyev said the weapons, without nuclear warheads, were sold
to those nations prior to the treaty and so they do not violate the
pact.

<HEAD>Lithuania Cuts Meat Shipments to Soviets; Will Try Trading Instead</HEAD>

   Lithuania is cutting meat shipments to Soviet
ministries by 10 percent in hopes of using the scarce food to
barter with Soviet factories for oil and other supplies, a
government spokesman said Tuesday.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has cut off oil and most
natural gas shipments to Lithuania in an attempt to force it to
rescind laws backing its March 11 declaration of independence. The
breakaway republic, which expects to run out of oil by next week,
already has laid off 12,500 people for lack of fuel.
   Lithuania will sell some of the meat to its own people and use
the rest for barter trade, said Aidas Palubinskas of the government
press office.
   Meat is in extremely short supply in the Soviet Union, making it
a valuable item for trade to workers in factories that produce
items Lithuania needs.
   The Soviet government newspaper Izvestia promptly accused
Lithuania of cutting milk and meat supplies to strike back against
the Soviet sanctions.
   ``Lithuania has decided to retaliate,'' Izvestia said. ``It has
nothing to lose. Meat shops in Vilnius now are selling only cow's
hoofs and pig's heads.''
   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis denied that vengeance
played any part in the decision. He cited the Soviet failure to
ship feed grain to the republic.
   Lithuania's anti-blockade committee on Tuesday ordered
preparation of a list of other strategic goods that may be pulled
from export in the future, the press office said.
   The Soviet Union has virtually halted shipments of wood and
certain plastics since the blockade began last month, the press
office said. Metal supplies have been cut by half, paper shipments
by 25 percent.
   At a news conference Tuesday evening, Landsbergis also advised
Lithuanians not to be bothered by Soviet soldiers marching through
the city in Wednesday's parade to mark the end of World War II.
   ``The best way to react is to completely ignore the parade, shut
your windows and even shut the shutters,'' he said, according to
Rita Dapkus of the government's press office.
   Landsbergis added that World War II is continuing in a sense
because the Soviet Union is refusing to give up the territory it
occupied then. Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are all trying to
regain the independence they had until Soviet troops occupied their
lands. They were forcibly annexed to the Soviet Union in 1940.

   A convicted child molester and heir to
the Thompson submachine-gun fortune was charged with violating
probation for allegedly offering a child a $100 to go with him,
police said.
   Russell Ambler Maguire, 65, whose fortune was once estimated at
$100 million, was held without bond at the Pinellas County Jail
since his arrest Friday, following an investigation.
   The probe began when a woman summoned police and said she
overheard Maguire talking to three children in a grocery store
parking lot.
   ``She recognized him and heard him offer one of them $100 to go
with him,'' said Pinellas Sheriff's Sgt. Greg Tita. ``She also
heard him say, `You're a real good-looking boy.'''
   The children, girls 4 and 12 and an 11-year-old boy, had no
physical contact with Maguire in the April 25 incident, Tita said.
   It was the second time Maguire was charged with probation
violation since his conviction in 1986 for fondling an 8-year-old
girl at his Clearwater Beach condominium.
   After the first conviction, Maguire was sentenced to 10 years
probation with psychiatric counseling. He was prohibited from
having unsupervised contact with children as part of his probation,
court records show.
   The first probation violation, for leaving the county and state
several times, brought him a 15-year prison sentence. The judge
ordered him to serve 30 months and to remain on probation for 12{
years.

   Wiesel's statement was read in Hebrew, English and German. The

   Wiesel, a survivor of the Auschwitz concentration camp, did not

<TEXT>
   Wannsee _ a warning,
   Wannsee _ the end _ the final solution.
   The target: Jews, all Jews, everywhere.
   Only Jews.
   What does a Jew today feel in this place, marked by evil and
malediction?
   Fear and trembling, anger _ incommensurate anger, helplessness
and grief _ infinite grief.
   Cry? One must not cry here! If you begin, you will not stop.
   How many tears does one shed for thousands of communities?
   How long does one lament the death of tens of thousands, of
hundreds of thousands of inoccent, abandoned, forsaken victims?
   If only the walls could speak,
   If only the trees and clouds could testify.
   We need to hear them, for most German men and women, in the
past, refused to speak, refuse to remember.
   It is here that, in a businesslike atmosphere of banality and
efficiency, twelve German high government officials, in the name of
their criminal leadership on behalf of their nation, condemned the
entire Jewish people to death and oblivion: teachers and their
pupils, brides and grooms, intellectuals and workers, rabbis and
their disciples, young revolutionaries and old dreamers of Zion.
   All were doomed. Simply, solely as Jews.
   At that time, children were still playing in the streets of
Sighet and Saloniki.
   Others were still begging for bread in the ghettos of Warsaw and
Bialystok.
   Still others were praying for the coming of the Messiah in the
hidden bunkers and attics of Vilna and Lublin.
   Here they were already dead and they did not know it.
   It is Jewish history that the Germans tried to annihilate here.
   It is Jewish memory that Germany tried to eradicate here,
forever.
   That is what a Jew remembers in Wannsee.
   But Wannsee also means for us Jews that memory is stronger than
its enemies.
   It means that Jewish hope has vanquished fear.
   It means that when we Jews visit and listen to the somber and
dark echoes at Wannsee, we aim at preventing future generations
from inheriting our past as their future.

<HEAD>Higher Prices for Less Milk in 1989, Says Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Milk production dropped last year but higher
prices boosted sales receipts of dairy farmers to a record level,
the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   Overall milk output in 1989 declined 1 percent to about 144.3
billion pounds from a record of 145.2 billion pounds in 1988, the
report said. But cash receipts from milk sales rose 10 percent to
$19.4 billion, eclipsing the old record of $18.5 billion set in
1983.
   Milk production has been rising this year in response to higher
prices and may edge up by 1 percent to 3 percent in 1990, possibly
to another record level, according to USDA forecasters.
   The annual report showed that actual marketings of milk in 1989
totaled about 142.1 billion pounds, down from 142.9 billion in
1988. About 2.1 billion pounds were used on farms where produced,
including milk fed to calves and used by dairy producer families.
   About 141.1 billion pounds of the milk marketed was sold to
plants and dealers for more than $19.1 billion, an average of
$13.56 per 100 pounds, the report said.
   More than 497 million quarts (about two pounds each) were sold
directly to consumers for an average of 53.9 cents per quart. Those
receipts totaled $267.9 million.
   The average number of milk cows in 1989 was reported at
10,127,000 head, down from 10,262,000 the year before. But average
milk production rose to 14,244 pounds per cow last year from 14,145
in 1988.

<HEAD>Hussein: Iraq Can Make Devices British Seized as Nuclear Triggers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALAH NASRAWI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Saddam Hussein displayed several
locally-made electric devices Tuesday, which he said were similar
to components seized by British customs agents who claimed they
were triggers for nuclear weapons.
   Saddam held up the devices before about 2,000 Arabs attending a
Baghdad rally, as he accused the West of trying to hinder Iraq's
technical development.
   He refuted charges by Britain and the United States that Iraq
was trying to obtain electric triggering devices for use in a
nuclear weapons program.
   The devices seized by customs officers in March at London's
Heathrow Airport had been manufactured in the United States.
   He also held up what he described as a U.S.-made condenser,
similar to those seized in Britain. He said Iraq had earlier been
able to import some of the same devices produced by an American
company.
   ``The ones they seized were not all what crossed,'' he said
without further elaboration.
   Saddam reiterated Iraq's denial that the devices were nuclear
triggers. He said they were electrical condensers intended for use
by the University of Technology.
   At the rally, Saddam held up two electric devices, which he said
were made by Iraqi technicians at the Ministry of Industry and
Military Industrialization.
   ``Only five days after the Americans said they (seized them) our
young men in the military industry managed to produce two
condensers,'' Saddam told the rally, called to express solidarity
with Iraq.
   ``If the British or the Americans want to import some of these
devices which are labeled `Made in Iraq' they can negotiate a deal
with the Ministry of Industry and Military Industrialization,'' he
said to cheers from the Arab delegates.
   Saddam said the technicians, without being asked, produced two
samples in two different government enterprises.
   The Iraqi leader also accused the West of conducting a campaign
to hinder what he described as Iraq's technical and scientific
advancement.
   He said the West ``chases Iraq wherever it purchased equipment
in order to prevent it, and consequently the Arab nation, from
looking to the future.''
   Saddam said Iraq will not abandon its technical research despite
pressure from the West.
   ``Technical and scientific advancement is the new title of
patriotism. So how can an honest and patriotic man retract from
such a course?'' he said.
   Saddam said the campaign against Iraq started in March after his
government hanged a London-based Iranian journalist, Farzod Bazoft,
accused of spying for Israel and Britain.
   He accused the West of threatening Iraq because of its support
for Arab nationalism.
   Iraq has denied any intention of developing nuclear weapons, but
Saddam created a furor by saying Iraq would unleash its chemical
arsenal against Israel in case of an Israeli attack.
   At the time of the joint U.S.-British customs sting operation in
March, Iraq said the devices described by U.S. prosecutors as
nuclear warhead detonation capacitors allegedly being smuggled to
Baghdad were intended for a non-nuclear university laser project.
   The 40 capacitors seized in March were labeled as air
conditioning units in an effort to get around U.S. bans on export
of militarily sensitive technology, U.S. officials said.
   Three people were arrested in England in connection with the
case after an 18-month investigation by U.S. and British customs
officials.
   Capacitors can be used to create the first electrical spark in
the chain reaction that leads to a nuclear explosion.

   One man was killed and two others

it was unloading fuel, officials said Tuesday.
   Another six people were injured as an explosion ripped through
the crew quarters the Filipino-registered Annette II Monday
evening, starting the blaze, local fire officials said.
   They said the vessel was carrying 83,000 barrels of jet fuel,
gasoline, diesel fuel and kerosene with a total value of more than
$2 million. The cargo was being unloaded at the Esso installation
at the Montego Freeport pier.
   There was no immediate word on any fuel spill into the Caribbean
coastal waters. Montego Bay, on Jamaica's northern shore, is in the
heart of the island's main tourist zone.
   Three fireboats, including two from the U.S. Coast Guard, were
battling the blaze. The ship was towed out to sea.
   The cause of the explosion was not immediately known. The dead
man was identified as a Jamaican stevedore, Herman Stephenson.

   Law enforcement officials worry about
high-tech weapons falling into terrorist hands, Attorney General
Dick Thornburgh said Tuesday.
   Thornburg hailed the weekend arrest in Florida of two Colombians
charged with trying to send Stinger ground-to-air missiles to drug
lord Pablo Escobar, but said the ``success of efforts to frustrate
the use of this technology is ... frightening in itself.''
   The Stinger incident underscored the interest of terrorists in
the use of highly sophisticated weaponry, he said.
   ``This raises the level of concern in law enforcement at all
levels,'' Thornburgh told a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.
``We hope to be able to frustrate these events before some
catastrophe takes place.''
   On another matter, Thornburgh told the committee that the
government is providing around-the-clock protection for 11th
Circuit judges as a result of the Dec. 16 package-bomb slaying of
federal Judge Robert S. Vance.
   Thornburgh said $7.5 million was made available in a recently
approved spending bill to provide U.S. marshal to protect the
judges. The circuit includes Florida, Georgia and Alabama.
   Two days after Vance was killed in his home outside Birmingham,
Ala., a similar bomb killed Robert Robinson, a Savannah, Ga., city
councilman and civil rights lawyer.
   Thornburgh said ``substantial progress'' was being made on the
investigation into Vance's death.

   Deputy Spanish Defense Minister Rafael de la
Cruz met with his American counterpart Tuesday in what a Pentagon
spokesman described as a cordial discussion of arms cooperation.
   Spokesman Bob Hall said de la Cruz had previously met with
Deputy Secretary of Defense Donald J. Atwood during a visit by
Atwood to Spain.
   Hall described the meeting with Atwood here as ``very cordial,
friendly'' and said the Spaniard was also meeting with officials of
the armed services.
   He said de la Cruz and Atwood ``went through a variety of
subjects about arms cooperation, the situation in Europe and
changing defense outlooks.''
   Spain, the United States and Italy are joining to develop an
updated version of the AV-8 Navy Harrier plane to be known as the
Harrier II Plus.
   The program, said to be budgeted at an estimated $485 million,
will develop the next generation of the famed vertical-lifting jets
for use by the navies of the three countries.
   Spain has 11 older models and will purchase 18 new ones; the
U.S. Navy expects to acquire 33 new Harriers; Italy, 17.
   The identically equipped new Navy jets, Spanish Defense Ministry
sources said, will provide the three navies with greater
compatibility in Mediterranean maneuvers and defense.

<HEAD>Environmentalists Criticize Bush For Ignoring Hiking Trail Needs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than $100 million President Bush wants
for building logging roads in national forests should be spent on
trails and recreational facilities that deteriorated in the 1980s,
environmentalists said on Monday.
   ``The U.S. Forest Service wants to spend 10 times as much money
on logging roads as it does on trails. That's an unacceptable
imbalance that reflects the misplaced priorities of an agency with
a `timber-first' approach to forest management,'' said Jay Watson,
The Wilderness Society's forest specialist.
   ``This fundamental imbalance has resulted in a logging road
network that would go around the world more than eight times while
at the same time our trail system has been allowed to fall into a
state of disrepair,'' he said.
   The National Wildlife Federation, Sierra Club National Audubon
Society and Amercian Hiking Society joined in the call to redirect
road contstruction funds into trail maintenance and construction,
wildlife management and recreation programs.
   Susan Henley, executive director of the American Hiking Society,
said trail usage has doubled since 1970.
   ``There's an increased recognition by the American public that
trails are are good, healthfull recreation. The demand is exceeding
the supply,'' she said.
   Fran Hunt of the National Wildlife Federation said the Forest
Service estimates a benefit-to-cost ratio of nearly $10 for every
$1 spent on fish and wildlife management, while the ratio for
logging and roads is less than 2-to-1.
   ``If you want to increase the economic values, you would
increase fish and wildlife spending, not logging and roading,'' she
said.
   Hunt said the roads the Forest Service builds to help harvest
timber would also displace wildlife, degrade habitats and cause
erosion that results in tremendous loss of fishing resources.
   ``In some areas, the damage to the fisheries exceeds the value
of the timber harvested,'' she said.
   Watson said Bush's budget proposals represent cuts from levels
Congress approved last year of 17 percent for trail construction
and 55 percent for maintenance of recreation facilities, including
campgrounds, boat ramps and visitor centers.
   The coaltion said Bush should be held accountable for the
spending blueprint even though much of the deterioration occured
over the past 10 years under the Reagan administration.
   Watson said 360,000 miles of logging roads currently cover the
national forest system's 156 units and another 33,000 miles are
planned in the next decade.
   About 100,000 miles of trails cover the same area, but there is
nearly a $200 million backlog of trail reconstruction and
maintenance in national forests, he said.
   The environmental groups said if $100 million were diverted from
the roads fund toward other programs there still would be $200
million left for logging road construction, enough to build and
reconstruct more than 5,700 miles of roads on national forests.

<HEAD>GAO Says Ticket Tax Increase Not Needed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration can modernize the air
traffic control system without raising ticket taxes to pay for it,
the congressional audit agency said Tuesday.
   ``Increased modernization costs and expanded use of the
(aviation) trust fund to pay for operations expenses ... do not
necessarily require an immediate increase in user fees,'' John W.
Hill Jr. of the General Accounting Office told a House panel.
   The Bush administration has proposed raising ticket taxes from 8
percent to 10 percent to finance the modernization.
   The administration has also proposed that the Aviation Trust
Fund pay a greater share of the operating costs of the Federal
Aviation Administration.
   The trust fund was set up in 1970 to pay for the equipment costs
of maintaining safety in the skies. The fund is financed chiefly
through ticket taxes, but also through fees on cargo and aviation
fuel.
   Despite its name, it is a bookkeeping account which must be
spent according to annual congressional directives.
   Hill testified before the Public Works and Transportation
investigations subcommittee. The subcommittee is trying to
determine if excess balances are building up and if so why Congress
is not spending them.
   Since 1971, the Aviation Trust Fund account has been used for a
share of FAA personnel and administrative costs. The administration
has proposed raising the share from the current 58 percent to 85
percent, arguing that private commercial and general aviation
account for 85 percent of the FAA's costs.
   Hill said the FAA could afford to use the trust fund to cover 75
percent of operating costs, plus pay for modernization, with no
increase in fees.
   Hill referred to the National Airspace System Plan, which was
initiated in 1981 to replace computer, radar and communication
equipment. Major delays and add-ons have caused the estimated cost
to rise from $12 billion to $16 billion.
   ``FAA now acknowledges that modernization will need continuous
funding and not end in 1991 as its preliminary cost-benefit
analysis for the NAS Plan indicated,'' Hill said.
   By being used to purchase government bonds that are not counted
in the deficit, the Aviation and Highway trust funds just mask the
true size of the deficit instead of being spent to clear congested
airways and repair highways, critics say.
   Critics also say other similar trust funds elsewhere in the
government are similarly used.
   The Transportation Department projects a cash balance for the
aviation fund of close to $15 billion by the end of September. It
was expected to take in $5.1 billion during the current fiscal
year, about two-thirds of which is revenue from the ticket tax and
a quarter is interest earnings, but pay out only $3.5 billion.
   Similarly, the department projects a cash balance of $18 billion
in the highway fund by the end of September this year, of which $7
billion is in a mass transportation account.
   Hill said a real surplus of $3.4 billion will exist for new
highway spending when the five-year spending authority for the
highway fund ends in 1991. The highway fund is financed through a
9-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax and 15-cent-a-gallon diesel tax was
well as other fees.
   The highway money goes to states, which administer projects.
Hill said states can afford much more highway spending than
Congress now allows with its spending ceilings.
   He pointed out that in 1989, Congress set a ceiling of $12
billion even though $22 billion was available.
   Kate L. Moore, assistant transportation secretary for budget and
programs, said the highway fund is highly leveraged, with the $11
billion balance supporting $33 in spending commitments through the
addition of state funds.
   She said much of the balance in the funds represents accumulated
interest owed by the Treasury, since the surplus is invested in
government securities. Spending down too much money would add to
the deficit, she said.

<HEAD>HUD Investigators Point Finger Of Blame At Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two veteran HUD investigators told Congress
Tuesday that it ignored warnings and must bear part of the blame
for scandals at the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   Paul A. Adams, inspector general at HUD, and his retired
predecessor, Charles L. Dempsey, told a Senate panel examining the
HUD scandals that they repeatedly pointed to program abuses in
semi-annual reports that went unnoticed by Congress.
   ``I never received so much as a phone call,'' said Dempsey, who
retired as inspector general in 1984.
   ``The information was there _ nobody was reading the reports,''
Dempsey said. ``Frankly, I thought no one up here gave a darn.''
   Adams said he received no reaction to his semi-annual reports to
Congress over five years, until the one last spring that drew
attention to HUD and began unraveling broader scandals of
influence-peddling, fraud and political favoritism at the
department.
   Potential fraud and management problems in some of those
programs were pointed out in previous reports that went unnoticed,
he said.
   ``I believe this inaction allowed HUD's problems to perpetuate
and grow to the point of scandal, as we all have seen,'' Adams said
in his prepared testimony.
   Both Adams and Dempsey spoke to the Senate Banking Committee's
subcommittee on the HUD scandals, which has been holding hearings
on ways to improve congressional oversight and HUD management. The
panel's hearings have gone largely unnoticed while a House
subcommittee drew attention for its investigation into the HUD
scandals.
   Under questioning, Adams said he found ``startling revelations''
in the testimony last week before the House panel by former HUD
deputy assistant secretary DuBois L. Gilliam, who gave detailed
accusations that politics dominated decisions about who got federal
housing grants under former Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr.
   Adams said his office is consulting with Justice Department
officials to ensure all Gilliam's allegations are investigated. In
an interview later, Adams said he would be consulting also with the
court-appointed special prosecutor investigating Pierce.
   Gilliam testified under a grant of immunity from further
prosecution. He pleaded guilty to charges of accepting gratuities
and abuse of HUD programs last year, after his activities were
uncovered by Adams' office.
   Adams declined to say which of Gilliam's allegations over three
days of testimony came as a surprise to him or merited further
investigation.
   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp referred angrily to Gilliam's charges in
a separate appearance before a Senate appropriations subcommittee.
   ``I am outraged that a former HUD official would suggest to a
committee of the Congress _ as DuBois Gilliam did last week _ that
Congress had better watch HUD becaause it's an election year,''
Kemp said.
   ``There is no room for politicking and profiteering at HUD,''
Kemp said.

   Arch Moore, the maverick Republican who
became West Virginia's only three-term governor this century,
pleaded guilty Tuesday to five counts of political corruption.
   Moore, 67, faces up to 36 years in prison and $1.2 million in
fines. He was released on a $10,000 personal recognizance bond
pending his scheduled sentencing July 10.
   U.S. Attorney Michael Carey said the government will make no
sentencing recommendation as part of its agreement with Moore.
   The former governor agreed April 12 to plead guilty to the
indictment accusing him of crimes involving his 1984 campaign and
his 1985-89 term. Moore also served as governor in 1969-1977.
   As other West Virginians went to the polls in the state's
primary election, Moore entered guilty pleas before U.S. District
Court Judge Walter Hoffman to two counts of tax fraud and one count
each of extortion, mail fraud and obstruction of justice.
   ``This is a very serious crime. Any time the franchise of the
voters is taken away from them is a serious offense,'' Carey said.
   Moore, accompanied by his wife, Shelley, answered to each charge
in a firm, strong voice, but he seemed overcome when Hoffman asked
him if he was ``induced'' to plead guilty.
   Moore paused for several seconds, his head down, before
answering in a strained voice, ``No.''
   He then left the courtroom through a side door to be
fingerprinted and photographed by federal marshals.
   Hoffman, who also has sentenced former Vice President Spiro
Agnew on tax charges and former Charleston Mayor Mike Roark on
cocaine charges, was called in from Norfolk, Va., after West
Virginia's federal judges recused themselves.
   The indictment said Moore defrauded the state of his salary and
benefits by funneling $100,000 into his 1984 campaign fund;
extorted $573,000 from a coal operator in 1985; filed false income
tax returns in 1984 and 1985; and tried to block the federal grand
jury investigation of him.
   Moore agreed to plead guilty after prosecutors told him they
secretly tape-recorded a meeting during which he admitted receiving
illegal cash donations in the 1988 campaign and discussed plans to
hide information from investigators.
   ``Mr. Moore used large sums outside the election process. It was
a scheme to run the election outside the limit of the law,'' said
John Campbell, an assistant U.S. attorney from the Justice
Department's public integrity section.
   Moore is the second West Virginia governor to be convicted of
federal charges. W.W. ``Wally'' Barron, a Democrat who served from
1961 to 1965, was acquitted of bribery conspiracy charges in 1968
but went to prison for bribing the foreman of the jury that
acquitted him.
   It also was the second time Moore was indicted. In 1975, he was
charged with extorting $25,000 from a financial holding company
trying to get a state bank charter. He was acquitted in 1976.
   Moore's political craftiness and flexibility allowed him to
survive four decades in a state where registered Democrats
outnumber Republicans 2-to-1.
   He was elected governor in 1968 and four years later held off a
challenge by Democratic Secretary of State Jay Rockefeller, who
later became governor and U.S. senator.
   Moore could not succeed himself after his second term, and he
lost a 1978 bid for the U.S. Senate. In 1984, he staged a comeback
and won a third four-year term as governor. The state's only other
three-term governor was Arthur Ingram Borman, who served from 1863
to 1868.
   Moore could not repeat the success of his 1969-77 terms,
however, and in 1988 was defeated by political novice Gaston
Caperton, a Democrat.

<HEAD>U.S. Gives Soviets Permission to Buy More Grain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has been given another
go-ahead to buy more grain from the United States, the Agriculture
Department said Tuesday.
   Undersecretary Richard T. Crowder said Moscow now has permission
to buy up to 22 million metric tons of U.S. grain without further
consultations, an increase of two million tons.
   A long-term grain agreement between the two countries specified
initially that Moscow could buy up to 12 million tons of grain a
year without further U.S. approval. That limit was raised to 16
million tons last October and to 20 million tons in December.
   The new limit of 22 million tons applies to the 12-month period
that began Oct. 1. The agreement itself runs through Dec. 31.
   Officials said the increase resulted from talks with the Soviets
in recent days and takes into consideration recent large purchases
of corn by Moscow.
   In all, since Oct. 1, the Soviet Union has bought about 18.9
million tons of corn and wheat for delivery in 1989 and 1990.
   Those orders include more than 15.6 million tons of corn and 3.3
million tons of wheat. Purchases also include 342,300 tons of
soybeans, 1.2 million tons of soybean meal and 7,300 tons of barley.
   In 1988-89, sales were a record of more than 21.7 million tons,
including more than 16.3 million tons of corn and nearly 5.4
million tons of wheat.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans.

<HEAD>Chinese Diet Study Challenges Way Americans Eat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major dietary study suggests that humans
are a vegetarian species whose risk of disease is increased by
eating meat and animal products, says a Cornell University
researcher.
   A plant-based diet is more likely to promote good health and
reduce the risks of heart problems, cancer, diabetes, osteoporosis
and other diseases, according to the preliminary findings of the
continuing study in China.
   ``People who eat mostly plant foods and a generous variety of
plant foods ... that is the kind of diet that is most likely to be
associated with reduced risk of the kinds of disease that tend to
kill us in this country,'' said T. Colin Campbell, a nutritional
biochemist who directed the continuing study.
   Other dietary studies reached similar conclusions focusing on
one aspect of a specific disease or on individual foods or
nutrients, but none has taken such an extensive look at ``the total
dietary pattern effect,'' said Campbell.
   ``Animal foods, in general, are not really helpful and we need
to get away from eating them,'' he said.
   Only in the last few thousand years have meat and animal
products become staples of our diet. ``That's not nearly enough
time to evolve new mechanisms to give us protection from those
kinds of foods,'' said Campbell, who is writing a book on the
reasons humans have turned into carnivores.
   The study began in 1983 to explore dietary causes of cancer but
was expanded to include heart and metabolic diseases and a variety
of infectious diseases. Aiding Cornell in the study are scientists
from the Chinese Academies of Preventive Medicine and of Medical
Sciences and the University of Oxford.
   Scientists surveyed 6,500 Chinese, each of whom contributed 367
facts about their diet. The preliminary findings will be reported
in a 900-page monograph to be published next month by Cornell
University Press.
   Campbell said there were several provocative findings regarding
proteins, fat and cholesterol among the roughly 8,000 correlations
that were found statistically and biologically significant in the
study.
   The study found that the Chinese consume one-third less protein
than Americans and that only 7 percent of their protein comes from
animal sources, compared with 70 percent for Americans.
   ``The dietary guidelines that have been formulated in the West
rather incorrectly protect our intake of animal protein.
Consumption of animal protein itself also raises the risk of cancer
and heart disease,'' he said.
   Previous studies have urged reducing dietary fat to less than 30
percent of an individual's daily caloric intake to curb the risk of
heart disease and cancer. But the Chinese study suggests that fat
should account for a maximum of 20 percent _ and preferably only 10
to 15 percent _ of calories.
   Campbell said the Chinese consume 20 percent more calories than
Americans do, but Americans are 25 percent fatter. That's because
Chinese eat about a third of the fat that Americans do and twice as
much starch.
   The study also found that the Chinese had a lower cholesterol
level than Americans, who consume more animal foods and dairy
products. Cholesterol levels in China ranged from 88 to 165
milligrams per 100 milliliters of blood plasma, while the U.S.
range extended from 155 to 274 milligrams.
   In addition to reducing the risk of heart disease, low
cholesterol also protects against colon cancer, the most common
life-threatening cancer among Americans, Campbell said.
   The Chinese diet contains three times more dietary fiber than
Americans', yet the study found no evidence that the high fiber
level interfered with the absorption of essential minerals, such as
iron.
   Campbell said the study showed that Americans don't have to eat
meat to prevent iron-deficiency anemia. The average Chinese adult
consumes twice as much iron as an American adult.
   People also don't need animal products to prevent osteoporosis,
a bone disease resulting from a lack of calcium. Campbell said the
study showed that people need less calcium than previously thought
and that the Chinese received enough from vegetables.
   The findings are only the beginning of the study's benefits,
said Campbell. The second phase of the research involves
resurveying the original participants and including people from 12
counties in Taiwan, which Campbell said is a dietary intermediate
between China and the United States.

<HEAD>Regulators Agree to Cut Prices on Some S&amp;L Properties</HEAD>

   Federal regulators agreed Tuesday to cut
prices on hard-to-sell real estate the government is inheriting
from bankrupt savings and loans.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the administration
endorsed stepping up sales, but withheld comment on the specifics
of the plan.
   The Resolution Trust Corp. voted unamiously to permit regulators
to cut a property's price by 15 percent if it had not sold in six
months _ four months for a single-family home. A further reduction
of 5 percent is allowed after an additional three months.
   The RTC adopted a second policy authorizing auction sales,
allowing no more than a 30 percent discount from appraised value.
   Meanwhile, the Joint Economic Committee said Tuesday that the
1990 budget deficit will swell to $185 billion, up from $152
billion last year, and that thrift-related spending could total $45
billion this year.
   The new sales policy is stirring concern among real estate
professionals who fear that too many cut-rate sales could hurt
already depressed markets in some areas of the country.
   ``It's a fine line that has to be walked. They (the RTC) are not
oblivious to this,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``We are concerned about getting rid of the properties in a way
that helps reduce the burden on the taxpayer,'' he said. ``We
obviously don't want to wreck the economy.''
   Regulators said holding a backlog of real estate off the market,
with the hope that prices will rise, can be just as harmful.
   ``We've become convinced that holding on to property is too
costly both for us and the taxpayer and what we're adopting is
designed to move properties without disrupting markets,'' said RTC
Chairman L. William Seidman.
   The proposal originally came before the RTC board two weeks ago.
The board delayed action at the urging of Comptroller of the
Currency Robert Clarke, who regulates nationally chartered banks.
   Clarke said he feared faster sales could hurt still-solvent
banks and S&amp;Ls struggling with deteriorating real estate portfolios.
   However, Clarke said an analysis by the RTC staff convinced him
the new policy would have little effect on solvent institutions.
   ``We've satisfied ourselves that as far as we can tell, and you
can never tell for sure, adoption of this policy would not have an
adverse effect on any of the institutions not in receivership,'' he
said.
   At the end of February, the last month for which firm figures
were available, the RTC owned $16.4 billion in real estate after
having sold $2.1 billion.
   It expects its portfolio to swell as it repossesses property
posted as collateral for now-delinquent loans.
   A Treasury-led panel overseeing the RTC's work for the Bush
administration encouraged the agency to offer greater price cuts
sooner than permitted in the new policy.
   In a related development, the RTC said it had hired a Miami
company, Auction Co. of America, to hold an unprecedented auction
of $200 million to $300 million worth of commercial properties.
Regulators anticipate holding the auction in late summer.

   The federal fraud and embezzlement trial of
Imelda Marcos recessed abruptly Tuesday for the second time in two
weeks when her blood pressure soared during testimony about her
family.
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, former first lady of the Philippines, began
sobbing when defense lawyer Gerry Spence cross-examined FBI agent
James Trimbach on his testimony about the Marcoses' using allegedly
stolen money for their own ends.
   Spence, apparently referring to the Marcoses' daughter Imee,
asked whether there was ``anything wrong with paying for your
children's education?''
   Mrs. Marcos began to sob, and friends said later that she was
upset by the allusion to her older daughter, whom she has not seen
in four years. Imee lives in Morocco and is not allowed to travel
on a Philippine passport, they said.
   After the judge declared a recess, she was taken to a nurse's
station.
   Aides to Mrs. Marcos quoted her physician, Dr. Rafael Zagala, as
saying her blood pressure had jumped.
   She later left the courthouse, quietly crying, on the arm of a
marshal and climbed into her black van to return to her midtown
apartment. Spence said he hoped Mrs. Marcos could return to court
on Wednesday.
   Earlier, prosecutors used a giant flow chart and Trimbach to
explain how Mrs. Marcos and her late husband allegedly used stolen
money to secretly buy a New York office building.
   They said that through money transfers involving 14 banks in New
York, California, the Bahamas and the Philippines, the Marcoses
paid $51 million for the Crown Building, a gilded tower across
Fifth Avenue from Tiffany's.
   It was the first of four buildings the prosecution says were
bought by the Marcoses with some of the $220 million allegedly
plundered from their country's treasury during former President
Ferdinand Marcos' 20 years in power.
   Mrs. Marcos is on trial in federal court for fraud and
embezzlement, along with Saudi Arabian financier Adnan Khashoggi,
who is accused of helping the Marcoses conceal their purchases.
Marcos died in exile in Hawaii in September.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Debra Livingston used the board covered
with boxes and arrows to show jurors how money moved from accounts
held by the Marcoses and their allies to other accounts and
eventually to the Crown purchase.
   Many witnesses, including several former bank officials, have
testified that Marcos used Philippine banks and government-owned
companies controlled by cronies to launder and conceal money
allegedly drained from the country's dollar reserves or skimmed
from government contracts.
   The chart purported to show that in September 1981, funds held
in five different banks were channeled through intermediate
accounts in six separate transactions, and eventually to the Crown
Building purchase.
   Most of the money, including $30 million from the Traders Royal
Bank of Manila, converged in a $43,128,239.25 deposit to the New
York branch of Banque Paribas of Geneva.
   Prosecutors say that the Banque Paribas account was managed by
Stephane Cattuai, whom they have described as the Marcoses'
personal Swiss banker, and that the money represented the bulk of
the payment for the Crown Building.
   Among the banks listed on the chart was the California Overseas
Bank, which on Monday was ordered by Judge John F. Keenan to be
turned over to the Philippine government as part of a plea bargain
by its former owner, Robert S. Benedicto.
   Benedicto, a Marcos friend, originally was indicted as a
co-conspirator but fled to Spain and then Venezuela. He gave up
ownership of the bank and pleaded guilty to wire fraud in exchange
for being dropped from the case.
   His lawyer, Wayne W. Smith, said the bank was worth between $20
million and $30 million.
   In a related development, the Los Angeles Times said the
Marcoses doled out about $8.5 million to politicians, reporters and
others in the final days of Marcos' regime in a desperate bid to
retain power.
   The ledger was among documents found at Malacanang Palace after
Marcos fled a popular revolt on Feb. 25, 1986, and Corazon Aquino,
who had defeated Marcos in an election days earlier, was installed
as president.
   It showed that Mrs. Marcos gave watches and envelopes of cash to
members of the national press corps during the campaign, and that
as votes were being counted she handed out money gifts at a dinner
for members of a government agency assigned to investigate election
fraud.

<HEAD>Bush, GOP Discuss Tax Increases, Hear Sour Economy Report</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with Darman, Foley, Panetta comment, inserting 8

<TEXT>
   President Bush discussed potential tax
increases with Republican lawmakers Tuesday as Budget Director
Richard Darman suggested deficit-fighting actions totaling as much
as $100 billion may be needed this year.
   A range of suggestions for raising revenues _ including a
national lottery, a one-cent federal sales tax and higher taxes on
alcohol and tobacco _ are ``part of the mix,'' said Assistant
Senate Republican Leader Alan K. Simpson, R-Wyo.
   Darman's figures _ he gave a range of $60 billion to $100
billion _ were two to three times the size of the savings that Bush
said would be needed when he proposed his fiscal 1991 budget in
January.
   The $100 billion figure is an outside possibility but ``I was
citing an extreme case,'' Darman said later in an interview.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said he and other Democratic
leaders would meet Wednesday morning with Bush on the budget.
   He commented after a meeting in which many House Democrats
insisted that Bush be forced to specify the economic conditions
that make major budget cuts necessary.
   ``If this summit is going to come up with very strong proposals
on deficit reduction, we're going to have to lay some groundwork
with the country why it's necessary,'' said House Budget Committee
Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif. He suggested major deficit-cutting
action would ``face a very tough time in the House and Senate on
both sides of the aisle'' in this election year.
   Darman said the scope of the action required depends on the
eventual cost of the saving and loan bailout ``and that's
impossible to estimate reliably at this point.''
   In any event, he said automatic spending cuts of over 20 percent
throughout government loom this fall if Congress and the White
House are unable to agree on a series of major deficit-cutting
steps.
   On whether Bush will support higher taxes as part of a budget
compromise, Darman said: ``He's prepared to talk without any
preconditions.''
   ``There are some ideas we're not prepared to put on the table,''
he added without elaboration.
   Although he won office on a ``no new taxes'' pledge, Bush made
it clear Tuesday he was willing to discuss some form of tax
increase as part of an overall budget compromise, GOP lawmakers
said.
   Simpson, speaking to reporters outside the White House,
suggested Bush had ruled out higher income taxes as part of any
budget compromise.
   But White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater wouldn't even go that
far. Instead, he repeated his day-earlier phrase that Bush had set
``no preconditions'' on budget talks _ not even to rule out raising
income taxes or reductions in Social Security cost-of-living
increases.
   ``We start these negotiations from scratch,'' Fitzwater said. He
said any tax increases that might emerge from a White
House-Congress budget summit were ``up to the negotiators.''
   Bush's opening of the door to tax increases for the first time
in his presidency carried the risk of political repercussions to
Republicans. And Republican lawmakers were clearly uncomfortable
with the phrase ``tax increase.''
   House Assistant Republican Leader Newt Gingrich of Georgia said
Republicans would not agree to any plan that would hurt them
politically in an election year.
   ``We're not going to agree to stupid deals,'' Gingrich said.
   Asked what kind of taxes might be raised, Gingrich said: ``I
don't know. We'll have to wait and see what the Democrats want to
discuss.''
   Participants at the White House session said Budget Director
Darman, at Bush's behest, delivered an unusually pessimistic review
of the economy.
   Darman later told GOP senators at a lunch in the Capitol that it
appeared the $64 billion fiscal 1991 deficit target under the
Gramm-Rudman law would be missed by at least $60 billion, said Sen.
John Danforth, R-Mo.
   The budget official reportedly told both the White House and
Capitol sessions that rising interest rates as well as higher
estimates of the S&amp;L bailout have swollen the predicted federal
deficit.
   The Gramm-Rudman law requires the deficit to be lowered to $100
billion this year and to $64 billion in the fiscal year that begins
Oct. 1. Mandatory spending cuts in both defense and most domestic
programs are triggered if the deficit levels aren't reached.
   Democratic senators, meanwhile, also met Tuesday to discuss
Bush's overture for a no-proposals-barred budget summit.
Participants said there was general agreement that Bush should be
forced to show his hand on what measures he would support to cut
the deficit.
   ``There was some talk that taxes may have to be raised, but
Democrats won't be the ones'' initiating tax hikes, said Sen.
Dennis De Concini, D-Ariz.
   After the White House session, Simpson said that spending cuts
of the magnitude described by Darman, which could slash 20 percent
or more from each program's budget, ``would be totally unacceptable
to the American people and totally unacceptable to the Congress.''
   Bush ``talked about the absolute necessity of no preconditions
and putting everything on the table,'' Simpson said.
   ``Value-added taxes, taxes on booze and cigarettes, a national
lottery, a one-cent national sales tax, all sorts of things like
that are in the mix,'' Simpson said, while adding: ``Nobody's
talking about raising income tax rates.''
   ``The president is fully aware that he's got a country to run
and he's got to do that in a responsible way because lots of
figures have changed,'' Simpson said.

<HEAD>Estonia Drops Soviet Symbols to Show Baltic Solidarity</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Estonia dropped the trappings of Soviet
power on Tuesday, changing its name and its flag, and proclaimed
solidarity with Latvia and Lithuania in the three Baltic republics'
drive toward independence.
   Without formally declaring independence, Estonia's Parliament
reinstituted some paragraphs from its 1938 constitution, including
one proclaiming Estonia ``an independent republic, with the supreme
state power vested in the people.''
   It dropped ``Soviet Socialist'' to become simply ``The Republic
of Estonia.'' And it adopted its old tricolor national flag in
place of the hammer-and-sickle banner of socialism.
   Parliament said the steps were meant to show solidarity with
sister republics Lithuania and Latvia, which have issued
declarations of independence. All three states were independent
until forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940.
   The deputies also adopted a resolution proclaiming Baltic
solidarity and congratulating Latvia on declaring independence.
   ``The path to our own statehood is not easy, but we are
convinced that here in the Baltics, we three _ acting together _
will arrive at a restoration of our independent states more
fruitfully than if each were to struggle on its own,'' said the
statement, broadcast on Radio Estonia and monitored in Britain.
   Lithuania's 3.8 million people are under an economic blockade
imposed by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in an attempt to
force Lithuania to rescind several laws passed since it declared
immediate independence March 11. Estonia and Latvia set unspecified
transition periods for secession from the Soviet Union.
   On Monday, Lithuania's Council of Ministers decided to cut meat
shipments to Soviet ministries by 10 percent in hopes of bartering
scarce meat directly with Soviet factories for oil and other
supplies, said Aidas Palubinskas, of the Supreme Council
legislature's information bueau.
   The Soviet government newspaper Izvestia accused Lithuania
Tuesday of reducing meat and milk shipments to the Soviet Union in
retaliation for Moscow's economic sanctions.
   In Latvia, legislators who oppose independence asked Gorbachev
not to impose sanctions on Latvia, saying that would hurt many
citizens loyal to the Soviet Union.
   The group called for a referendum on independence.
   Activists say the recent parliamentary elections constituted a
referendum on independence. Advocates of separation won more than
two-thirds of the seats in the parliaments of all three Baltic
republics.
   Latvia issued a declaration of independence on May 4 but did not
ask for an immediate break with Moscow or suspend the Soviet
constitution. It is waiting to hear if Gorbachev will impose
sanctions similar to those on Lithuania.
   Latvians make up 53 percent of the 2.6 million people in their
native land, and many Russian and other non-Latvian residents
oppose independence.
   In Estonia, Parliament approved the constitutional changes and
the traditional symbols of state by a vote of 73-14. Eighteen
deputies did not vote or did not attend the session.
   Minutes later, a small crowd gathered on the cobblestone square
outside the ancient parliament building and watched as the red flag
was lowered. It was replaced by the blue-black-and-white striped
flag used by Estonia when it was independent between the two world
wars.
   Matt Laar, a deputy from Tallinn, the Estonian capital, said the
republic already is feeling the effects of the Soviet oil and
natural gas embargo against Lithuania because a Lithuanian refinery
processes half of Estonia's gasoline.
   Estonians have tried to start talks with the Kremlin about
eventual independence, but Moscow has refused.
   The Estonian Independent, an English-language weekly in Tallinn,
reported that Gorbachev adviser Alexander Yakovlev told Estonian
Supreme Soviet chairman Arnold Ruutel negotiations could not start
until Parliament suspended its March 30 decision to cancel the
Soviet constitution on Estonian territory.
   Laar said Tuesday's action followed two days of negotiations
among groups in the legislature, including the Popular Front, the
Communist Party and representatives of the ethnic Russian minority
that makes up 30 percent of the 1.5 million population. Ethnic
Estonians comprise 64 percent of the population.
   In Latvia, the United Council of Work Collectives, which claims
140,000 mostly non-ethnic Latvian members, called for a strike to
protest the declaration of independence. It gave no strike date,
but leaders previously mentioned May 15.
   A front-page appeal in Latvia's Communist Party newspaper said
pro-independence leaders ``did not consider it necessary to ask the
people: Do they want a return to unemployment, lawlessness and
oppression? Do they want hunger, cold and bankruptcy as in
neighboring Lithuania?''
   It called the declaration of independence ``an anti-Soviet and
anti-constitutional state coup.''
   Anatoly Alexeyev, head of the Interfront Movement that unites
thousand of non-Latvians, said he expected a major
anti-independence demonstration on Wednesday during Victory Day
celebrations marking the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II.
   The West has responded cautiously to the independence movements,
fearing they could weaken Gorbachev's attempts at reform. President
Bush has been reluctant to do anything that might affect his May 30
summit with Gorbachev.

   West German Finance Minister Theo Waigel
conferred with President Bush on Tuesday and said afterwards that
there is ``no risk of inflation'' from the union of the two
Germanys.
   Waigel said Bush expressed keen interest in hearing the latest
developments, from the negotiations on a common currency to the
number of East Germans who have resettled in the West.
   Waigel said Bush and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady were
``especially impressed by the fact that the federal central bank,
the Bundesbank, will have sovereignty over all monetary political
matters in the entire German economic zone.
   ``So there will be no risk of inflation due to unification and
monetary and economic union,'' Waigel told reporters on the White
House driveway. He spoke in German, with an interpreter translating
the remarks.
   Waigel said the meetings of Western finance ministers here this
week had confirmed again ``that the monetary union and the economic
community between East and West Germany will make a contribution to
growth and will even reduce imbalances.''
   He said East Germany is undertaking ``radical steps'' toward a
market economy.
   ``The reform there is more radical than anything that's going on
in any other Eastern and Central European nation,'' he said.
   Waigel is also chairman of the Christian Social Union, one of
the parties in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition government.
   The finance minister said he thanked Bush for U.S. support for
German unity. ``These are very difficult but very interesting
times, and the Americans have clearly been on our side,'' Waigel
said.
   Kohl will visit the White House on May 17.

   Rain spread across the south-central section of the nation
Tuesday, while record cold hit the Northwest and snow fell west of
the Rockies.
   Showers and thunderstorms associated with an upper level
disturbance crossing Texas extended from the central and western
Gulf Coast to southern Missouri, with thunderstorms along the Gulf
Coast.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT was 1.57
inches at Galveston, Texas, 1.37 inches at Lake Charles, La., and
1.36 inches at Port Arthur, Texas.
   Record lows were reported at Astoria, Ore., at 34; Medford,
Ore., 31; Olympia, Wash., 30; Pendleton, Ore., 35; and Spokane,
Wash., 31.
   Snow fell across parts of Idaho, Wyoming and Colorado, with up
to 8 inches of snow reported in the Big Horn mountains of
north-central Wyoming.
   Up to 6 inches of snow was possible in the northern and central
mountains of Colorado by Wednesday morning.
   A freeze warning was posted for the Cache Valley and Wasatch
Front of northern Utah, and a frost warning was issued for the
lower agricultural areas of southern Idaho.
   Strong northwesterly wind ushered cold air into the
north-central states.
   Strong southerly wind prevailed from the southern high Plains to
the lower Ohio Valley and the upper Great Lakes, with wind blowing
stronger than 35 mph in the Chicago area.
   Strong southerly wind in the Southwest helped keep temperatures
unseasonably mild in some areas. Morning lows of 51 at Flagstaff,
Ariz., and 73 at Las Vegas, Nev., were records for the date.
   Elsewhere, a few showers were scattered across the northern
Atlantic Coast region.
   Flooding continued in Oklahoma, Arkansas and Texas. The Arkansas
River crested at Little Rock, and Lake Texoma on the Texas-Oklahoma
line was finally receding from its record flood of more than 27
feet above normal. In Dallas' Rochester Park neighborhood, Red
Cross officials said at least two-thirds of the 174 homes affected
by flooding from the Trinity River since early last week were still
inundated.
   Tuesday's low for the Lower 48 states was 23 at Big Piney, Wyo.

<HEAD>Admiral Urges Gorbachev to Maintain Law and Order</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Soviet admiral urged President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev on Tuesday to invoke ``strict law and order'' against
draft evasion, desertion and Baltic insults against World War II
veterans.
   The remarks by Adm. Vasily Grishanov, at a rally in the Bolshoi
Theater marking the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945, drew prolonged
applause from a crowd of veterans, many of them decorated generals
and admirals from the Second World War.
   Gorbachev, addressing the same meeting on the eve of a Victory
Day military parade in Red Square, received tepid applause for a
speech that lauded veterans, but dwelt largely on disarmament and
Josef Stalin's purge of the officer corps on the eve of World War
II.
   Grishanov, a little known three-star admiral, did not directly
criticize Gorbachev or the Baltic republics of Latvia, Lithuania
and Estonia for seeking to secede from the Soviet Union _ the first
of the 15 Soviet republics to take such a step.
   But his speech was one of the clearest public expressions yet of
dissatisfaction among officers of Kremlin tolerance toward the
separatist movements in the Baltic republics.
   ``The heart aches,'' Grishanov said. ``Unfortunately, in recent
years, certain political forces have been persistently forming a
negative attitude toward the Soviet Armed Forces. They are trying
to break down the notion of the motherland for the young people.''
   ``As a result, there is a phenomenon of pacifism, evasion of
military service, and unfortunately even acts of desertion,'' he
said.
   ``We veterans are calling upon the young men to be real men.
Prepare to fulfill your constitutional duty of defending the
motherland!'' he said.
   ``The whole society must take real care of its defenders. In
general, there must be a strict civil law and order in the state,''
he said.
   The veterans nodded their heads repeatedly during the speech,
and burst into spontaneous applause at the mention of law and order.
   The admiral appeared to be in his 70's, but was not introduced
as ``retired,'' as is customary for officers no longer on active
duty.
   ``The way they treat war veterans in the Baltic republics is a
tragedy,'' Grishanov said, alluding to assertions by Baltic
residents that the Soviet soldiers occupied rather than liberated
their nations during World War II.
   The Soviet Union forcibly annexed Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia
in 1940 as part of a pact with Nazi Germany. The Soviet Congress of
People's Deputies in Moscow passed a resolution saying that the
Nazi-Soviet Pact was invalid, but maintains that the annexation was
voluntary.
   Many Russians, particularly in the military, have been critical
of Gorbachev for allowing what they view as the dissolution of the
Soviet Union and its alliance in Eastern Europe, much of which was
consolidated under arms during World War II and its aftermath.
   Gorbachev reiterated his view that the reunification of Germany
would be welcome as long as the security of the Soviet Union and
other countries was ensured. He warned that any effort to change
post-war borders would be a ``great, fatal mistake.''
   The Soviet Union along with wartime allies the United States,
Britain, and France is now meeting with representatives of the two
German states to try to work out the formula for reunification. A
major sticking point is the West's demand that a united Germany be
a part of NATO.
   Gorbachev rejects that demand, but did not directly address the
issue in his speech.
   He sharply criticized Stalin's repression of the Soviet officer
corps in the late 1930s, and the dictator's unwillingness to
believe that Germany was planning an attack.
   Gorbachev credited Stalin with managing the system that turned
the Soviet Union's war fortunes around. But he said the system only
worked because during a war Stalin had to leave many decisions to
the intelligence and initiative of subordinates in the field rather
than managing the war from the capital.
   He sat quietly through Grishanov's speech, twiddling his fingers
on the green baize-covered table in front of him, as he often does
when listening to speeches critical of his policies.
   Soviet authorities were planning a military parade in Red Square
on Wednesday to mark the 45th anniversary of the end of World War
II in Europe.

<HEAD>Deadly Kentucky Blast Blamed on Ventilation Violations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Six alleged violations of federal mine
ventilation rules contributed to a methane explosion that killed 10
Kentucky miners last year, the government said Tuesday.
   A federal investigation into the blast found that some Pyro
Mining Co. managers knew that explosive methane gas was
accumulating in the mine four days before the explosion, but they
did not maintain required records that would have alerted others.
   A report by the Labor Department's Mine Safety and Health
Administration also said that autopsies found traces of marijuana
in one victim and marijuana and cocaine in another, but there was
no evidence that linked the drug use to the Sept. 13 explosion in
Wheatcroft, Ky.
   James Greenlee, executive vice president of Costain Coal, Inc.,
which owns Pyro, said the company had not reviewed the report and
would not discuss its findings yet.
   The company allowed six violations of federal ventilation
requirements to occur in the days and hours before the accident,
said William Tattersall, assistant labor secretary for mine safety
and health.
   ``The combination of violations set the stage for the
explosion,'' Tattersall said.
   The mine safety and health agency does not immediately propose
fines against companies for allegedly violating safety regulations,
but eventually, the company could face up to $100,000 in fines, an
agency official said.
   The report alleged that managers failed to make required checks
for the deadly gas in the hours before the explosion, failed to
keep enough clean air in the mine to sweep out methane and made a
series of changes in air pathways that caused a methane buildup the
day of the disaster.
   The report said mining equipment that did not meet federal
requirements was operated in the mine.
   Federal investigators were unable to determine exactly what
triggered the explosion, although they identified five
possibilities _ a cutting torch, a sccop tractor with multiple
electrical safety deficiencies, detonation of a blasting cap, a
spark generated by falling roof rock or snapping of a steel wire
under tension.

<BYLINE>Federal Agency Puts $582 Million Water Project in Limbo
^By STEVEN K. PAULSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal Fish and Wildlife Service has
recommended a seven-year study of the environmental impact of a
proposed $582 million Colorado water project that would kill the
project, a congressman said Tuesday.
   The agency determined that the Animas-La Plata water project in
southwestern Colorado would have adverse effects on so many other
water projects in New Mexico and Colorado that further
investigation is required, Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell said.
   Campbell, a Democrat, said contracts with the Southern Ute and
Ute Mountain Ute Indian tribes, which have senior water rights in
the region, require that the project be completed in 10 years.
   ``This would postpone it so much that it destroys the
agreement,'' he said.
   The project would irrigate 68,000 acres of farmland, settle a
lengthy government water rights dispute with the two tribes and
provide drinking water for Durango residents. The project would
include two reservoirs, three major pumping plants and a 157-mile
network of pipes and canals.
   Supporters say the project would assure water for the future in
southwestern Colorado and northwestern New Mexico.
   Critics claim the project would ruin the Animas River and
provide water that would be too expensive for farmers, and that
Indian water claims could be satisfied by a cheaper project.
   A spokesman for the Fish and Wildlife Service declined to
comment on the ruling, saying the Colorado and New Mexico
congressional delegations had to be briefed first.
   Groundbreaking had been delayed until June so federal biologists
could complete an endangered species study on possible effects on
squawfish and razorback suckers.
   Campbell said the ruling doesn't make sense because the federal
government previously imposed a program to eliminate the fish it is
now trying to protect.
   Campbell was referring to earlier efforts by state and federal
agencies to eliminate trash fish from rivers in the area in an
effort to make a better environment for trout.
   According to biologists, Animas-La Plata would deplete up to 18
percent of the flows downstream into the San Juan River now relied
upon by rare fish. The San Juan, as it now flows through New Mexico
and Utah, is one of only five rivers believed to be supporting wild
populations of the squawfish.
   In the last three years biologists have discovered 27 squawfish
and 13 razorback suckers in stretches of the San Juan River 90
miles downstream of Animas-La Plata.
   The Colorado squawfish, a silvery migratory fish that grows up
to 5 feet long, was placed on the federal list of endangered
species in 1967. The razorback sucker, a humped fish that grows up
to 30 inches lnog, was proposed for protection on the list last
year.

   Fighting the bout with cancer, from which his brother had died
two years ago, Channell ``was in tough shape,'' Kuykendall said.
``But until he got hit, his spirit was remarkable.''
   Services for Channell were being held in his home state of West
Virginia.
   Channell was sentenced to two years' probation in July 1989 for
using his tax-exempt foundation to funnel millions of dollars to
the rebels. He was accused of soliciting wealthy conservatives for
sums of more than $1 million in some cases. Working with then-White
House aide Oliver North, Channell routed the money to help the
Contras during the time when Congress had banned formal U.S.
assistance.
   Channell was the first person in the Iran-Contra affair to admit
he violated the law. He pleaded guilty in April 1987 to one count
of conspiring to defraud the Treasury of tax revenue. He admitted
falsely advising wealthy contributors that their donations to the
Contras were tax deductible.
   He subsequently assisted prosecutors in the investigation of the
sale of American arms to Iran and the diversion of profits to the
Contras.

<HEAD>Cheney Wants NATO's Nuclear First-Strike Policy Retained</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CALGARY, Alberta (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said
Tuesday he wants NATO to maintain the policy that allows for a
first-strike use of nuclear weapons in the event of a Warsaw Pact
invasion of Europe.
   Cheney, en route to a NATO session reviewing nuclear strategy,
told reporters that the alliance's defense ministers will lay the
groundwork for a lengthy review of NATO strategy involving the use
of conventional and nuclear systems.
   President Bush called for the review last Thursday in light of
the political and military changes that have swept Europe the past
year.
   The president's request came as he announced he had scrapped
plans to replace short-range nuclear missiles in Europe with an
updated version and put aside plans as well to upgrade the nuclear
artillery shells in NATO's arsenal.
   Cheney was to be joined by the defense ministers of 14 other
NATO nations for the first of four sessions leading up to a summit
in London in July of all NATO leaders.
   Cheney said he intended to brief the allies on Bush's
initiative, which comes as the member nations reassess NATO's
political and military significance amid the crumbling of its
longtime foe, the Warsaw Pact.
   Bush's decision on short-range weapons does not signal the
beginning of the removal of U.S. nuclear weapons from Europe,
Cheney stressed.
   ``That does not mean that you want to walk away from the role of
nuclear weapons in the overall defense of Europe,'' Cheney said.
``We think U.S. nuclear capability, both theater and strategic,
will continue to be an important part of our overall alliance
strategy.''
   Cheney said the ``flexible response'' doctrine, allowing for the
first use of nuclear weapons, has provided security for the
alliance for decades ``and I'm not eager to remove one part of it.''
   ``I would not give that up,'' he said at another point.
   Cheney was asked whether the debate will now switch from the
hotly contested issue of the Lance missile to alliance plans to
modernize air-launched nuclear missiles known as TASMs (Tactical
Air to Surface Missile). The secretary said he didn't see ``any
reason'' for the defense ministers to discuss the issue.
   ``There's nothing that's happened within the last few weeks that
... in any way changes our approach to TASM,'' Cheney said.
   NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner, who accompanied Cheney
on the flight, said Monday he expected the defense ministers to
formally issue a statement supporting Bush's initiative on
short-range weapons.
   He said he also expected them to direct the Supreme Allied
Commander in Europe, U.S. Gen. John Galvin, to undertake a
comprehensive study of the alliance need for its nuclear weaponry.
   Cheney said he expected the meeting scheduled for Wednesday and
Thursday to focus on ``both conventional and nuclear forces and
where we will go with respect to arms control.''
   The meeting is with members of the Nuclear Planning Group, which
is composed of the defense ministers of the 16 NATO nations, except
France and Iceland.
   The secretary said it was a ``reasonable guess'' that the NATO
review process may last into next year, given ongoing East-West
talks on reducing conventional forces, but that he wouldn't put a
timetable on the study.

<HEAD>Bill Would Allow Political Activity for IRS, CIA, FBI Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate voted Tuesday to allow law
enforcement, intelligence and tax agents to spend their off time
soliciting campaign contributions from colleagues and taking other
active roles in partisan politics.
   On a 51-46 vote, Senate Democrats rejected a Republican attempt
to exclude employees of the FBI, the CIA, the Internal Revenue
Service, the Justice Department and the Federal Election Commission
from a proposal to relax rules on political activities by
government workers.
   ``The FBI, CIA and Justice Department are still in a special
category,'' said Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas. ``I
do not believe we want to politicize those agencies.''
   Democrats denied trying to politicize those workers or any of
2.9 million civil service and postal employees they claim would
benefit from their proposed relaxation of the Hatch Act.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, said his bill overhauling the
51-year-old law was intended to clarify conflicting rulings on what
political activities federal workers can participate in while
totally forbidding such activities on the job.
   The Hatch Act now forbids the nation's 3 million federal civil
service and postal workers from participating actively in politics
off the job but allows them to wear campaign buttons while at work.
   Glenn's bill would outlaw the buttons but lift most restrictions
on off-the-job activities so that federal employees could hold
party offices and solicit campaign funds from their co-workers, but
not from the general public.
   Dole's amendment to maintain the prohibitions on campaign
activities by IRS, FBI, CIA and FEC workers and career federal
prosecutors was one of several unsuccessful GOP attempts Tuesday to
chip away at Glenn's bill.
   ``Laws restricting those people and what they can do are already
on the books,'' Glenn said. ``They cannot use information gained on
the job politically.''
   Also defeated were GOP amendments to maintain a ban on federal
workers holding office in the two political parties and delaying
any changes in the Hatch law until after a campaign finance reform
bill is enacted.
   The first amendment, by Sen. William V. Roth, R-N.H., was
defeated on a 64-32 vote and the second, by GOP Whip Alan K.
Simpson of Wyoming, was rejected 61-36.
   Republicans have contended the entire bill amounts to a ``pot of
gold'' for the Democratic Party because unionized public employees
and their political action committees overwhelmingly favor
Democrats.
   ``lf we banned all PACs, there wouldn't be much demand for this
bill,'' said Dole, holding open a threat that Republicans later
this week might try to attach to the measure their proposed package
of campaign finance reforms.
   ``The only purpose of this bill is to make the federal employee
union PACs fatter, of which 88 percent (of their campaign
donations) goes to the other party,'' he said.
   Despite repeated assertions that President Bush will veto any
changes in the Hatch law, Democrats so far have garnered several
votes from Republicans on each challenge by the GOP leadership to
the bill.
   The House approved a much broader revision of the Hatch Act by
an overwhelming 297-90 vote more than a year ago.
   But the House bill also would permit federal workers to run for
public office solicit campaign contributions from the public. The
Senate bill would retain current prohibitions against those two
activities.

   Election year discomfort among Republicans was
obvious Tuesday after President Bush's lips moved and taxes
suddenly appeared on the budget negotiating table.
   ``I'm opposed to having taxes be on the table, period,'' said
Rep. Bill Schuette of Michigan, one of the Republican congressmen
challenging a Democratic senator.
   Schuette's comment was typical of GOP candidates who have made
opposition to tax increases a centerpiece of their campaigns.
   As one Republican operative put it, ``There is a clear anxiety
among Republican candidates.'' Speaking on the condition he not be
named, the source said that candidates and activists ``feel there
has been a clear distinction between the parties on the tax issue.
They feel the negotiation would be used by the Democrats to muddle
the distinction.''
   Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, the Democrat who lost to
Bush in the 1988 presidential election, called Bush's ``no new
taxes'' pledge ``a fraud on the American public.''
   ``I know it was effective and the election is over,'' Dukakis
said. ``But to make that kind of commitment given the size of the
federal deficit, this (savings and loan) disaster, which is going
to cost the people of this country hundreds and hundreds of
billions, was irresponsible.''
   Republicans feared the public also would remember the Bush
pledge.
   ``I'm not going to vote for anything which causes us to lose
politically,'' said House GOP Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia after a
White House meeting with the president.
   The initial reaction of Ed Rollins, co-chairman of the House
Republican campaign committee, was that injecting the possibility
of a tax increase this election year was ``a disaster.''
   ``There is something of an anti-tax movement around this country
... and certainly Republicans are on the right side of that at this
stage of the game,'' said Rollins, who added that ``the most
significant contrast between Democrats and Republicans is on the
tax issue. The public feels that the Republicans ... are the party
that's fighting against raising their taxes.''
   A shift in that perception, he said, would ``certainly affect
our candidates who are challenging Democratic incumbents to take
the tax pledge.
   Since 1980, the Republicans have portrayed Democrats as the
``tax and spend'' party.
   ``Read my lips, no new taxes,'' was Bush's most memorable line
from the 1988 presidential campaign.
   When he stood before the 1988 Republican convention to accept
its presidential nomination, Bush predicted this day would come.
   ``And the Congress will push me to raise taxes, and I'll say no,
and they'll push, and I'll say no, and they'll push again,''
declared the presidential nominee. ``And I'll say to them: Read my
lips. No new taxes.''
   The Democratic-controlled Congress refused to push. The word on
taxes sent to the White House from the start of the Bush
administration was ``After you, Mr. President.''
   Then, at a Sunday night summit with congressional leaders in the
White House living quarters, the president agreed that everything _
including taxes _ would be on the negotiating table in the effort
to come up with a way to cut the federal deficit.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Tex., chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, called it ``a question of walking that plank together.''
   But the 1990 campaign trail is clogged with Republicans who
adopted Bush's ``read my lips'' stance.
   For Schuette, taxes is ``a defining issue. It separates Bill
Schuette from (Democratic Sen.) Carl Levin. And I think it
separates many Republicans from many Democrats.''
   But does Schuette suddenly find himself separated from Bush?
   The congressman hopes not.
   ``Do I think he will in the end agree to something that raises
taxes?'' he replied. ``No, I don't think he will.''
   Kelly Mitchell, press secretary for Rep. Robert Smith, R-N.H.,
who is running for the Senate seat being vacate by GOP Sen. Gordon
Humphrey, said Smith ``does not support tax increases. He plans to
maintain that position.''
   Other hard-line anti-taxers were Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill.,
challenging Democratic Sen. Paul Simon and Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa,
challenging Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin.
   ``I am apoplectic,'' said a Republican political operative, who
insisted on anonymity. ``This comes out just in enough time so the
Democrats have a shield around them for the rest of the campaign.''
   Republicans were quick to insist that an increase in income
taxes was not being discussed.
   ``Value-added taxes, taxes on booze and cigarettes, a national
lottery, a one-cent national sales tax, all sorts of things like
that are in the mix,'' said Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming, the
Senate Republican Whip.
   Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island, the third-ranking Senate
Republican, complained the media were getting the emphasis wrong.
   ``Bush thinks news people are making a great mistake to center
it around taxes,'' said the Rhode Island senator.
   ``I don't want him to raise taxes,'' said Bruce Benson, the
Colorado Republican Party chairman. ``I still want him to cut
government. ... I also know we've got a government that if the
Democrats won't work with you without some kind of a switch
sometimes you have to bend and let the Democrats push you into
something.''
   Anticipating the Republican argument that Bush was being dragged
``kicking and screaming'' to consideration of a tax increase, House
Democratic leaders were quick to say they weren't putting pressure
on the president.
   ``Democrats are disinclined to drag them kicking and screaming
anyplace,'' said Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., chairman of the House
Democratic Caucus.
   ``They called us,'' said Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., vice chairman
of the caucus.

   The tales of bikini-clad table-dancers
flashing their breasts at patrons of the Country Cafe and Lounge
were finally too much for the residents, who got the village
fathers to ban go-go girls.
   ``There were a lot more activities going on inside that bar than
just dancing,'' resident Lori Burden said Tuesday, after residents
of this central Illinois community of 440 petitioned the village
board Monday night.
   The petition was signed by 111 of the town's 201 registered
voters. About 75 people packed the tiny Village Hall as the board
voted 4-2 to declare the go-go girls ``lewd and lascivious.'' The
ban takes effect in 10 days.
   Charles Muehlebach, who owns the Country Cafe and Lounge, two
bars and a liquor store in neighboring Decatur, said the girls had
been dancing here since 1983.
   ``They don't strip or dance naked. They just flash. This place
is like a Sunday school compared to places in the cities,''
Muehlebach said. ``I don't know what started this. We've never had
any trouble before this. I don't understand it.''
   Muehlebach said he's considering legal action against the
village to compensate for lost revenue.
   ``This is a town of 400 and all it's got is a laundromat, a
grain elevator and a couple of bars. The other bar owner is
thinking about closing because business is so bad. Now they want to
shut me down.''

<HEAD>De Klerk Leaves for Europe Meetings, Call for End to Isolation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk left
Tuesday on a major European tour aimed at convincing Western
leaders that South Africa has changed enough to justify an end to
international efforts to isolate it.
   ``It is wonderful to go to Europe with the knowledge that South
Africa is busy taking its rightful place in the international
community,'' the South African leader said at an airport news
conference before his departure.
   The first stop on the nine-country, 18-day tour is France, where
President Francois Mitterrand has shunned previous South African
leaders in protest against the system of white minority rule.
   Although apartheid still exists, de Klerk's historic talks last
week to settle differences with the African National Congress have
led the French leader and others to agree to give de Klerk a
hearing.
   In recent months, de Klerk also freed political prisoners
including African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela and had
taken other steps toward reform.
   The evening news on South Africa's government-run television
said a senior government source described the tour as ``a concerted
effort to pull South Africa from the morass the country has found
itself in.''
   ``The visit is not only going to be demanding of the state
president but also of the utmost importance to South Africa,'' the
television said.
   After France, de Klerk will visit Belgium, Italy, West Germany,
Britain, Spain, Switzerland, Greece and Portugal. His exact
itinerary is being kept secret for security reasons, but he is to
meet the heads of government in every country.
   Among his hosts will be British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, King Juan Carlos of Spain and West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl.
   ``I welcome the opportunity for re-evaluating what is happening
in South Africa to the heads of state and heads of government I
will be visiting,'' de Klerk said at his news conference.
   Many Western countries have imposed economic and trading
sanctions against South Africa and cut athletic, entertainment and
scientific exchanges because of apartheid, under which the black
majority of 28 million in this nation of 37 million residents has
no vote in national affairs.
   But de Klerk has pledged to end white rule and share power with
the black majority. In the government's first-ever talks with the
African National Congress, the country's most powerful black
political organization, the two sides agreed to work together to
end political violence and clear the way for formal negotiations on
a new constitution.
   Two months ago, Mandela had been calling for increased sanctions
and complete diplomatic isolation of South Africa. But after last
week's talks he said the ANC would not seek new sanctions.
   Government television reported that Spain is considering ending
its entertainment and sports boycott of South Africa in response to
de Klerk's visit and the talks with the ANC.
   The South African foreign ministry described it as the most
extensive foreign trip by any South African head of government
since the ruling National Party came to power in 1948.
   ``There will be no slipping in by the back door,'' government
television assured viewers. In the past, South African leaders have
visited foreign countries as tourists.
   De Klerk will also be looking for support for his political
plans. Western European nations have been an important source of
aid and support for the ANC and de Klerk hopes they will help to
control more radical black elements that oppose any peaceful
solution with the white government.
   De Klerk said he was visiting European leaders to tell them that
instead of pressure, South Africa needs encouragement.
   ``This does not mean interference,'' he added.
   De Klerk is accompanied by Foreign Minister Pik Botha and other
officials.
   ``We have such a good case to present at the moment that I'm not
worried about the outcome of the tour,'' he said.

   President Bush sent messages congratulating
Nelson Mandela and South African President F.W. de Klerk on their
historic first round of talks, the White House said Tuesday.
   Bush has invited both men to visit the White House. An informed
administration source said Tuesday those visits will probably take
place in the latter part of June. The source spoke only on the
condition of anonymity.
   The White House did not release the texts of the messages, but a
deputy spokesman, Roman Popadiuk, said Bush characterized the three
days of talks as ``very positive.''
   Earlier, in Johannesburg, the African National Congress released
the contents of Bush's letter to Mandela. De Klerk's office
confirmed he had received a letter from Bush but did not divulge
the contents.
   ``Your brave struggle against apartheid and your commitment to
peace and a political solution to South Africa's great problems
have stirred the hopes of many,'' Bush wrote Mandela, the deputy
president of the ANC.
   ``The American people respect this commitment and support your
efforts to achieve a non-racial and democratic South Africa with
equal opportunity for all,'' Bush said.
   The letter said the great energy shown by Mandela since de Klerk
freed him from a life prison sentence in February had helped the
country move closer to achieving those objectives.
   ``The joint commitment to a peaceful process of negotiations and
efforts to resolve the existing climate of violence agreed to by
the African National Congress and the government is a great step
forward to this end,'' Bush said, adding that he looked forward to
discussing those issues with Mandela when they meet later this year.

<HEAD>Jury Finds Magazine Defamed Tennis Star, But Ruling Not Binding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury on Tuesday found a Swedish
magazine guilty of defaming former tennis star Bjorn Borg by
printing allegations he used drugs, but the verdict was not binding.
   A formal ruling was expected in the case next week.
   Borg, a five-time Wimbledon champion, sued the weekly magazine Z
for $58,000 after it quoted his former girlfriend Jannicke Bjorling
as saying he used drugs.
   Z's chief editor, Jorgen Widsell, told the court Tuesday he had
three sources who said Borg had used cocaine. A day earlier, Borg
denied in court that he ever used drugs.
   His lawyer argued that the magazine knew Ms. Bjorling was in the
midst of a bitter child-custody dispute with Borg at the time of
her comments. The two, who were not married, have a son.
   Before Tuesday's verdict by the nine-member jury, Borg stormed
out of the courthouse after the judge denied his attorney's request
to call an additional witness.
   ``This is enough for me. I'm leaving,'' Borg said. He told
pursuing reporters: ``I do not care what you write.''
   Three judges were to deliver a formal verdict in the case Monday.

   East Germany's first democratically elected
Parliament on Tuesday eulogized the millions of people who died at
the hands of Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime.
   Recalling the horrors of the Nazis and the deaths of six million
Jews, in addition to millions of Russians, Poles and others,
Parliament President Sabine Bergmann-Pohl said ``the insane path of
German history found its end on May 8, 1945.''
   Referring to last fall's peaceful revolution that brought down
East Germany's hard-line Communist leadership and opened the way
for the reunification of East Germany and West Germany, Mrs.
Bergmann-Pohl said: ``Today we have the hope that May 8 does not
remain as the last mutually binding date for German history.''
   ``But it will always be closely tied to whatever happens along
our way into the future,'' she added.
   Also on Tuesday, a special ceremony dedicated to the thousands
of Soviet soldiers killed by Nazi troops in battles to capture
Berlin, was held at East Berlin's Treptow Park, the site of a war
memorial to the Soviets.
   Officials say about 5,000 Soviet soldiers died fighting the
Germans in the last few days of the war in Europe and the battle
for Berlin.
   The parliamentary ceremonies coincided with a meeting in East
Berlin's Palast Hotel between World Jewish Congress leader Edgar M.
Bronfman and East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere.
   Bronfman said at the meeting that a memorial should be erected
at the site of the Berlin Wall that was opened last Nov. 9, because
the date had ``dual importance.''
   On Nov. 9, 1938, Nazis killed dozens of Jews and ransacked
Jewish homes and stores in what became known as Kristallnacht, or
crystal night, because of the broken glass that littered the
streets afterward.
   ``Let me suggest that the date Nov. 9 is a really important date
in black distress and golden hope,'' Bronfman said.
   Prior to the meeting, leaders of the Jewish Congress held a
memorial ceremony at the Wannsee Villa in Berlin, where German
leaders met in 1942 to map out their so-called ``Final Solution''
that led to the death of 6 million Jews.

   Carl ``Spitz'' Channell, the first person to
plead guilty to illegal activities in the Iran-Contra case, has
died of pneumonia while recovering from a car accident, associates
said Tuesday.
   The conservative fund-raiser, who was 44, died Monday at George
Washington University Hospital, said hospital spokeswoman Terry
Abdoo.
   Channell pleaded guilty in April 1987 to conspiring to defraud
the government by using his tax-exempt foundation to raise money
for the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. The plea marked the first break
for special prosecutors in their investigation of the Iran-Contra
case.
   He later assisted prosecutors in the investigation of the sale
of American arms to Iran and the diversion of profits to the
Contras.
   Former Rep. Dan Kuykendall, a friend of Channell, said Channell
had been undergoing chemotherapy for lung cancer and had recovered
enough to engage in consulting work.
   But he was struck by an automobile March 15 near his office in
Southeast Washington, according to Kuykendall, who is now a Capitol
Hill lobbyist.
   District of Columbia police spokeswoman Shannon Cockett said the
driver of the car, Donald Parker Jr., had lost control of his
vehicle.
   Parker, a Washington resident was given a ticket for failure to
pay full time and attention, a moving violation, she said.
   Because the accident resulted in a death, the case will be
referred to the U.S. attorney for further investigation, Cockett
said.
   Abdoo said Channell had been admitted to the hospital April 17
and associates said he was being treated for complications from the
car accident and the cancer.
   Channell ``struggled and struggled,'' to recover from massive
injuries that included several broken bones and a crushed pelvis,
said Kuykendall.
   Fighting cancer, from which his brother had died two years ago,
Channell ``was in tough shape,'' Kuykendall said. ``But until he
got hit, his spirit was remarkable.''
   Services for Channell will be held Saturday in Elkins, W.Va.,
followed by burial in Huttonsville, W.Va., said Eleanor McManus,
who is Channell's aunt.
   Channell was sentenced to two years' probation in July 1989. He
was accused of soliciting wealthy conservatives for sums of more
than $1 million in some cases. Working with then-White House aide
Oliver North, Channell routed the money to help the Contras during
the time when Congress had banned U.S. government assistance.
   He admitted in pleading guilty to falsely advising wealthy
contributors that their donations to the Contras were tax
deductible.

   ``John Paul II, the whole world loves you,''
goes the chant heard in the streets during the pope's visit to
overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Mexico. But a few dissenting voices
can also be heard.
   Critics are asking whether the papal visit is a means for the
ruling party to win political mileage. They question church policy.
They complain about the exclusivity of one papal Mass, and skewer
the commercial hoopla surrounding the pontiff's eight-day visit.
   As always in Mexico, some of the most biting commentary has come
from editorial cartoonists. The pro-government newspaper Excelsior
ran a cartoon about church opposition to birth control, which
showed the pontiff's jet approaching Mexico amid a huge flock of
storks.
   Political analyst Adolfo Gilly, in the daily newspaper La
Jornada, criticized the pope for preaching ``submission theology''
as opposed to ``liberation theology,'' a doctrine that holds the
church must actively involve itself in the fight for social justice.
   The pope has also drawn complaints over his support of
celebrations of the 500th anniversary of Christianity in the
Americas, set for 1992. Indian activists say the church served as
an agent of the Conquest, which decimated their population and
shredded their culture.
   El Financiero, Mexico's business daily, noted that only the
well-connected and the affluent got tickets to the pope's Sunday
Mass at the Basilica of Guadalupe.
   The shrine was a sea of lace, pearls, richly jeweled rosaries,
silk ties and soft wool suits. Thousands of others, patient in
their humble clothes, had to stand behind police barricades outside
in the rain.
   ``Do you know what happened in those streets you toured in your
covered car?'' La Jornada rhetorically asked the pontiff. Even the
government daily, El Nacional, took note of the plight of the
masses.
   ``Hours of waiting? Was it worth it to see the pope for less
than a minute?'' ran one of its headlines Monday.
   The pope and President Carlos Salinas de Gortari have been
sharply criticized for striking what some see as a rather unholy
alliance.
   The cartoonist Helguera, for instance, drew a crassly grinning
pontiff holding a crucifix superimposed over the flag of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which has ruled Mexico
for 61 years.
   The PRI clearly hopes to make political points with the papal
visit and the prospect of establishing formal relations with the
Vatican.
   The church, which supported conservatives and opposed social
reform, lost its property and many of its rights between 1859 and
1926. Church officials have said they would welcome amendments to a
constitution that now forbids the church to own property, bans
religious education, outlaws clerical garb in public and bars
priests from voting.
   Most of those restrictions are ignored in practice nowadays, but
opposition politicians have criticized the PRI for what they say is
a cynical attempt to shore up flagging support by engineering a
formal rapprochement with the church.
   There is still enough opposition in Congress to make Salinas
reluctant to try to ram through constitutional changes, but
normalizing relations with the Vatican would not require that.

   Four days before the deadline for filing civil
rights charges, a top Justice Department official said Tuesday no
new evidence has been found to justify re-opening the case of the
bloody confrontation between Philadelphia police and the radical
group MOVE.
   But John Dunne, chief of the department's Civil Rights Division
told reporters, ``The case will have my full attention for the next
72 hours. I am hopeful that we will able to find any new
information.''
   Eleven people died, including five children, when police bombed
a fortified row house occupied by MOVE on May 13, 1985. A fire that
began when the bomb was dropped destroyed 61 homes.
   A group of Philadelphia ministers, lawyers and community
activists is still hoping a federal grand jury could be presented
with evidence and issue indictments before the weekend.
   But after meeting with the group for an hour, Dunne said he
could offer no assurances.
   ``The federal statutes are very strict,'' Dunne said. ``There
must be hard evidence to prove guilt beyond a resonable doubt that
a party or parties intended to deny people within our community
their civil rights which are protected by the federal law.''
   ``To date, it is our conclusion that there is not sufficent
evidence,'' he said.
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who organized the meeting, said the
case could be presented to a grand jury in ``a half a day.''
   Specter has badgered the Justice Department for two years to
take another look at the MOVE evidence. He won a promise at Dunne's
Senate confirmation hearing that the department would keep that
possibility alive.
   A Philadelphia grand jury and a federal investigation previously
have concluded that the evidence would not support indictments.

   One week before 8-year-old Holly Rizzi
was killed by a car that careened through a park in this Chicago
suburb, she walked up the aisle of St. Mary's Catholic Church to
receive her First Communion.
   On Tuesday, her funeral was held there.
   About 300 friends, relatives and classmates from St. Mary's
Catholic School attended the service for Holly, one of three
children killed Saturday when the car plowed through the park and a
game of Little League T-ball.
   Six other children and three adults, including the car's driver,
were injured.
   ``If before we took them for granted,'' Associate Pastor Robert
Burnell said of Riverside's children, ``we will no longer do so.''
   Despite the tragedy, Burnell told the mourners, Holly's friends
and schoolmates would be able to cope with the loss.
   ``Children, too, know about the mysterious, the inexplicable.
They know about death,'' he said.
   ``Many a child has seen a black casket lowered into a grave and
known that grandmother was no longer cooking in the kitchen.''
   Holly's parents, Michael and Julia Rizzi, sat silently with her
brothers, Peter and Nicholas, during the hour-long service. The
parents appeared upset but did not cry when the small white-veiled
casket, surrounded by pink and white flowers, was carried into the
church.
   Later, outside, children wept as the seven-car procession left
for a private burial.
   The funeral for another victim, 8-year-old Ryan Womack, was set
for Wednesday.
   Rites for 7-year-old Colin Anderson were to be held Thursday in
the chapel of a hospital where his father, Bruce, 43, remained in
fair condition, recuperating from a leg injury suffered in the
crash.
   A Cook County grand jury has issued at least a dozen subpoenas
in its investigation into how James J. Harasek's Cadillac came to
plow through the park Saturday afternoon, just as the game was
beginning.
   T-ball is a kind of Little League baseball for young children in
which the ball is set up on a tee, rather than pitched.
   Harasek, 59, was hospitalized in fair condition with a fractured
elbow. He has refused to answer investigators' questions on the
advice of his attorney, Charles G. Levy.
   Levy said tests taken when Harasek was admitted to the hospital
showed no alcohol in his blood.
   Police are seeking medical records and testimony from Harasek, a
retired tavern owner who, state records show, was ticketed five
times for traffic violations over the last 24 years.
   Investigators said they also want Harasek's relatives and
friends to testify about his condition and whereabouts before the
crash.
   On Tuesday, 8-year-old Jacqueline Tuglis remained hospitalized
in critical condition, 7-year-old Kevin Rose was in serious
condition, and 7-year-old Justin Glaredon was in fair condition,
said Michael Maggio, a spokesman for Loyola University Medical
Center.
   Three children and one adult were released from the hospital
after treatment for their injuries.

<HEAD>Bill Passed to Carry Out 1972 Treaty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House approved legislation Tuesday to put
into effect a 1972 treaty against biological weapons.
   By a vote of 408-0, the House approved a bill which makes it
illegal to develop and possess biological weapons. The bill goes to
the White House, where President Bush is expected to sign it into
law.
   Under the legislation, any individual, corporation or government
is prohibited from developing or possessing any biological weapons,
and prohibited from assisting a foreign state or organization from
doing so.
   Biological weapons are harmful forms of bacteria, viruses, fungi
or naturally occuring toxins that could be directed at an enemy. A
biological weapon could be unleashed on an unsuspecting public by
using it in a liquid to contaminate water or in an aerosol that is
dropped by bomb.
   In 1925, the Geneva Protocol banned the first use in war of
biological and chemical weapons, but did not address the
development, production, possession or transfer of the weapons.
   Forty-four years later, President Nixon ordered the Defense
Department to destory its arsenal of biological weapons. The United
States then spearheaded the fight for an international ban on
production and possession of them.
   On April 10, 1972, in Washington, Moscow and London, 111
countries signed the Biological Weapons Convention, which prohibits
production and possession of the weapons.
   The Senate ratified the treaty two years later.
   According to the pact, each nation must take ``any necessary
measures'' to prohibit biological weapons at home. Legislation was
introduced in Congress over the years to include the prohibition in
U.S. law, but the measures never got far, largely because no
administration or powerful congressional group pushed for passage.

<HEAD>Christian Militias Ignore Cease-fire, 19 Injured in Shelling</HEAD>

   Rival Christian forces ignored a call for
a Tuesday cease-fire and pounded each other with artillery and
rocket barrages, devastating residential areas and severely
damaging two hosptitals.
   Nineteen people were injured Tuesday, raising the toll to 19
dead and 46 wounded since fighting was renewed Monday between
renegade Gen. Michel Aoun's army and Christian warlord Samir
Geagea's Lebanese Forces militia.
   According to a police count, 941 people have been killed and
2,502 wounded since the fight began Jan. 30.
   In south Lebanon, meanwhile, four people were killed and six
wounded in artillery duels between the Iranian-backed,
fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God, and their Shiite rivals,
the Syrian-supported Amal militia, police said.
   The two militias have been battling on and off for two years for
dominance of Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiite community, the country's
largest sect.
   In another incident, Israeli soldiers killed two Arab guerrillas
Tuesday in a clash near the border, the Israeli army said.
   The Israeli military said the guerrillas' identity was unknown.
On Monday, Israeli troops shot and killed a guerrilla belonging to
a pro-Syrian organization and captured another in a shootout six
miles north of the border.
   In Beirut's Christian sector, a three-man mediation committee
called for a cease-fire Tuesday evening, but the call went unheeded
as the two rival factions bombarded residential areas at the rate
of 20 shells and rockets a minute.
   Nasrallah Sfeir, patriarch of the Maronite Catholic Church, was
one of the leaders appealing for the cease-fire.
   Aoun and Geagea are Maronites, the Christian community that has
dominated politics in Lebanon since independence from France in
1943.
   ``Our bible does not permit such practices. Enough destruction.
Enough war,'' Nasrallah said.
   ``This shelling only leads to more destruction. ... It doesn't
lead to any outcome. Only the poor population is the victim,''
Sfeir said in his appeal broadcast by all radio stations in Lebanon.
   On Monday, thunderous shelling raged through the night, setting
hospitals and apartment blocks on fire. Huge tongues of flame
licked into the night sky amid the flashes of exploding shells and
rockets.
   The fighting in the Ashrafiyeh, Karantina, Badaro and Furn
el-Shubbak neighborhoods of Christian east Beirut eased off around
daybreak into mortar and machine gun clashes.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said Aoun's military hospital in Badaro was severely
damaged by salvoes of 122mm rockets fired by Geagea's gunners.
   He said Aoun's 130mm howitzer batteries hammered the Hospital de
Notre Dame du Liban in Jounieh, a Geagea-controlled port 12{ miles
north of Beirut.
   One hospital patient was interviewed on Geagea's Lebanese
Broadcasting Corp. television station.
   ``Despite my wound, I left the bed and hid in the closet. I
stayed there until nurses came into the room and took me to the
shelter on a stretcher,'' he said.
   A carpet of debris and broken glass covered the corridors of the
seven story hospital and its owner, Dr. Fawzi Azaimi, appealed to
both sides to stop shelling medical centers.
   ``This is a crime,'' said Azaimi, who heads the syndicate of
private-sector hospitals.
   ``Private hospitals can hardly cope with the difficulties
they're facing. We cannot afford reconstruction costs. I plead with
the government for urgent financial assistance,'' he added.
   The Christian confrontation has caused damage estimated at $1
billion and forced 400,000 of the enclave's 1 million population to
seek refuge in safer parts of Lebanon or flee abroad.

   Talks broke down within minutes
Tuesday between protesters and government, and about 8,000 enraged
anti-Communists crowded into central University Square demanding
that interim President Ion Iliescu resign.
   Another demand is the exclusion of former Communists from
politics.
   The crowd swelled from about 1,000 at noon as protesters
streamed to the square following the talks breakdown.
   The square is the site of an anti-government rally that began 17
days ago. Demonstrators promise to continue their protest until May
20, when Romania holds its first free national elections in more
than 50 years.
   Iliescu and other former Communist officials within his National
Salvation Front, which dominates the provisonal government, broke
with their Marxist past after the December revolution here and
embraced democratic ideals.
   But their critics accuse them of clinging to Communist ideals
and of desiring to reimpose totalitarian rule if the Front wins the
elections.
   Recent polls indicate Iliescu and the Front are well ahead.
   Four protest leaders went to government headquarters at 10:30
a.m. for talks with Iliescu and other leaders of the provisional
Parliament, but stormed out after Iliescu and Vice President Ion
Caramitru kept them from videotaping the proceedings. A government
offer of a stenographer to record the minutes was refused.
   It was not clear whether a dialogue would be resumed.
   Protest groups coordinating the rally said they want a dialogue,
but they want it recorded.
   Iliescu spokesman Paul Financu told a news conference ``a
dialogue is still possible if (protest leaders) clarify their own
position.''
   He said their demand to film the talks ``showed they were
interested in publicity and not substance.''
   Iliescu reversed his earlier position and agreed Friday to hold
a dialogue with a delegation from the demonstrators, but then ruled
out any discussion of their demands to change the electoral law and
delay the balloting.
   The protest delegation Tuesday included Stelian Tanase of the
intellectual Group for Social Dialogue and leading former dissident
Doina Cornea.
   Iliescu, a former Communist Party functionary, fell out of favor
with dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in the early 1970s and was
relegated to lesser posts. He rose to prominence after the December
revolution that led to Ceausescu's ouster and execution.
   A government statement Tuesday deplored the ``reprehensible''
attack on presidential candidate Radu Campeanu of the National
Liberal Party during a campaign stop Saturday in Braila, 180 miles
northeast of Bucharest.
   Liberal Party officials said Campeanu suffered a cut face.
   The statement directed police to ``do their duty to ensure order
and peace at electoral meetings and protect candidates from any
violent acts.''
   It expressed ``confidence no political parties are behind the
violence.''
   But Liberal Party and National Peasant Party officials blamed
National Salvation Front supporters for attacks on their candidates
for Parliament and the presidency, and threatened to boycott the
elections if political violence continues.
   A mile from the rally in University Square, visiting Mother
Teresa, the 79-year old missionary and Nobel Peace laureate, met
students and implored them to ``prayer, love and peace.''
   She is in Romania with four other nuns to set up a permanent
mission in Chitila, eight miles northwest of Bucharest.
   Mother Teresa, who leaves Wednesday, has visited orphanages and
a hospital for AIDS-infected children.

<HEAD>Company Meets Union Anyway</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Greyhound meeting with union officials only
hours after the bus line declared victory in the drivers' strike
shows the company still needs the union's help to rebuild its
struggling company, a union official said Tuesday.
   Union President Edward M. Strait said he met with Greyhound
chairman Fred Currey Monday afternoon, just a few hours after
Currey held a news conference to declare the strike over.
   ``If they continue to hire drivers who don't know where they are
going, the traveling public is the one that suffers,'' Strait said
of the company's pledge to hire non-union replacements for
rebuilding the bus line, which lost $56 million in the first
quarter.
   Greyhound Vice President Anthony Lannie said bus company
officials met with union officials Monday, despite their
declaration of victory in the 2-month-old strike, because they'd
rather give 1,300 remaining jobs to union drivers than spend $5,000
to train each new driver.
   Officials on both sides kept the Monday afternoon meeting under
wraps until Tuesday. In a letter Tuesday to local Greyhound union
presidents, Strait described the meeting as ``less than cordial''
and said it produced ``absolutely nothing.''
   ``My only hope at this juncture is that his creditors will take
the initiative to tell Fred Currey'' to get back to the bargaining
table, Strait's letter said.
   Currey's victory declaration is ``merely another smoke screen to
avoid the real issue _ a fair and equitable contract for the
professional employees who built the company,'' Strait's letter
said.
   Over the weekend, the two sides held their first bargaining
talks since mid-March, but the talks quickly broke down after the
company offered a four-year wage freeze and proposed an elimination
of 4,500 union jobs. The union called the offer an insult.
   The union represents 6,300 drivers and about 3,000 office and
maintenance workers who walked off the job March 2.
   As of Monday, the company said 548 union drivers had crossed
picket lines. It also had hired 2,888 new drivers and had 501
others in school, which would give it 3,937 available drivers by
May 16.
   Greyhound, which is in the midst of scaling backs its services,
has said before it could operate a full system with about 3,200
drivers, although more are needed for the busy summer travel season.
   It told the union over the weekend it had immediate openings for
about 600 union drivers and could probably make way for another 700
within a few months.

   Former Resistance fighters saluted Vice President
Dan Quayle at a World War II victory ceremony Tuesday as angry
motorists blared car horns because Quayle's motorcade was blocking
traffic around the Arc de Triomphe.
   Quayle stopped at the Arc to celebrate the 45th anniversary of
victory over Nazi Germany after flying into Paris from London,
where he pledged that NATO will adjust to the changes of a free and
united Europe.
   ``There is no substitute for NATO,'' he said in London.
   Quayle joined British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher there at
a ceremony marking the 100th birthday of Dwight D. Eisenhower, the
wartime Allied commander who helped create NATO's military force
and later became president.
   In Paris, a score of former Resistance fighters stood in
formation underneath a huge tricolor by the eternal flame burning
at the monument in honor of France's unknown soldier.
   The vice president and his wife, Marilyn, shook hands with each
veteran to the cheers of onlookers out for a late evening stroll
under balmy spring skies.
   Motorists leaned on their horns meanwhile because of the snarled
traffic around the Arc, the capital's busiest intersection. Part of
the motorcade carrying news photographers became lost in the
holiday-weekend traffic.
   The Quayles landed at Orly Airport in Paris aboard Air Force
Two. They were spending the night with U.S. Ambassador Walter J.
Curley.
   Quayle holds talks Wednesday with President Francois Mitterrand,
Premier Michel Rocard and European Space Agency officials before
returning home.
   He will also address a delegation headed by Mayor Jacques
Chaban-Delmas of Bordeaux, a former Resistance leader and chief of
the French committee honoring Eisenhower's 100th birthday.
   The vice president said in London that the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization will work with other institutions to ensure European
security as the Cold War comes to an end.
   Both Quayle and Thatcher paid tribute to Eisenhower's postwar
vision of a free and united Europe.
   ``He foresaw the unification of Germany and foresaw that we
should come to a stage when a divided Europe would be a thing of
the past,'' Mrs. Thatcher said of Eisenhower. ``That is what we're
working for now.''
   Attending the ceremony was Eisenhower's granddaughter, Susan
Eisenhower, and her Russian husband, Roald Sagdeev, former head of
the Space Research Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.
   On the future of the 16-nation Alliance following the downfall
of communist governments in Eastern Europe and the reforms in the
Soviet Union, Quayle said, ``NATO will accommodate itself to the
changes.''
   He said the Western military alliance would work with the
12-member European Community, the 35-nation Conference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe, and other institutions ``to provide for
European security and also to look to trade opportunities.''
   The vice president and Mrs. Thatcher discussed East-West
relations, the Soviet Union, Lithuania, and hostages at a dinner
Monday night at Chequers, her country residence.
   At a meeting Tuesday with Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, both
Quayle and Hurd ruled out any deals to free the 16 Western hostages
being held in Lebanon.
   ``Negotiations were conducted in the past ... and you can see
where we are today. Hostages are still being held,'' Quayle said in
a British Broadcasting Corp. television interview.
   ``President Bush is adamant about this. The prime minister is
adamant about this. We do not negotiate with terrorists. Hostages
should be released.''
   Six Americans are among those held in Lebanon. Held longest is
Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Quayle arrived Monday night from Rome on a European tour
commemorating Eisenhower.
   As Mrs. Thatcher was waiting to greet Quayle at her 10 Downing
St. residence on Tuesday, her husband Denis Thatcher, who had been
on a golfing vacation in Florida, returned home after an overnight
flight.
   ``I am waiting for the vice president. Would you like to meet
him?'' Mrs. Thatcher asked her husband. Reporters and photographers
were standing by.
   ``I need a shave,'' Thatcher said and disappeared.

   A lawyer for three drought-plagued western
states asked a federal judge Tuesday to order the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers to maintain water levels in a crucial reservoir along
the Missouri River.
   But lawyers for the corps, which wants to lower the river's
reservoirs to support shipping downstream, contended a federal
judge has no authority to dictate how the corps should manage its
system of six Missouri River dams.
   Former South Dakota Gov. William Janklow, who is representing
the three states, said lowering the level of Lake Oahe would
destroy this year's hatch of millions of walleye eggs. That would
deal a $20 million blow to North Dakota and South Dakota's tourism
industries, he said.
   Both North Dakota and South Dakota rely on fishing and attendant
tourism to boost their economies, Janklow told U.S. District Judge
Patrick Conmy.
   ``We don't live in wealthy states ... We have very limited
economic opportunities available to us,'' he said.
   South Dakota, North Dakota and Montana are suing the corps in an
effort to block the agency's plans to allow the water level of Lake
Oahe to fall 3 feet before June 1. The lake stretches from
south-central North Dakota into South Dakota.
   The three states are seeking a preliminary injunction to force
the corps to maintain the lake at its current depth until June 1.
On Tuesday, the lake was measured at 1,588.4 feet above sea level.
   The judge said he would rule by noon Wednesday on the request.
The lawsuit was filed Friday, and Tuesday was the only day of
arguments.
   But Charles Findlay, a Justice Department attorney representing
the corps, said Conmy had no authority to intervene in the agency's
management of the river reservoirs.
   A judge may step in only if the corps acted in bad faith, and
the agency has consulted the affected states extensively in making
its management decisions, Findlay said.
   The three states' request would block shipping in the Missouri's
navigation channel, which stretches from Sioux City, Iowa, to St.
Louis, Findlay argued.
   Keeping the river's level low also could disrupt the nesting of
two federally protected rare birds, the piping plover and interior
least tern, he said.
   Janklow countered that the birds would not be affected, and any
harm to the shipping industry was exaggerated.
   Shipping contributes only $14 million in benefits to the system,
compared to $67 million in benefits from fishing and recreation,
Janklow said.
   South Dakota Gov. George Mickelson and North Dakota Gov. George
Sinner attended Tuesday's hearing, as did attorneys representing
Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas and Missouri.
   Officials of the three states said the lawsuit reflects growing
anger at the corps' management of the entire Missouri system in a
lingering drought, now entering its third year in the Dakotas.

<HEAD>Judge Says Camarena Trial Will Be Most Interesting</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The trial of four Mexican men charged in the
murder of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena may be ``one of the most
interesting cases'' a jury could address, a judge told prospective
jurors Tuesday.
   U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie urged the panelists to
``search your hearts and minds'' before asking to be excused from
the case because of hardship.
   The trial, focusing on the internationally sensitive 1985
slaying of the Drug Enforcement Administration agent, is expected
to last about two months.
   More than half of the 250 possible jurors said it would cause
financial or other hardships to be away from their jobs for so
long, but 118 prospects said they could serve and were given a
37-page questionnaire to fill out before actual questioning begins
in court Wednesday.
   The questionnaire asked how much jurors had read or heard about
the highly publicized Camarena investigation.
   They were asked to disclose whether they had read about 150
people, including Mexican drug lord Rafael Caro-Quintero and an
array of alleged participants in Camarena's torture murder.
   The list also included the name of Elaine Shannon, author of a
book on the case, which was turned into a TV movie.
   ``This case will perhaps be one of the most interesting cases on
which you will have the opportunity to serve,'' the judge told jury
candidates.
   Camarena, 31, was kidnapped off a Guadalajara, Mexico, street in
February 1985. Testimony at the trial of three other men convicted
in 1988 showed he was tortured and interrogated by drug lords
before he was killed along with his pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar.
   Their bodies were found a month later on a ranch 65 miles
outside Gudalajara. The killings were said to be in retribution for
DEA seizures of 10,000 tons of marijuana.
   The four men on trial are Ruben Zuno Arce, the brother-in-law of
former Mexican President Luis Echeverria; Juan Ramon Matta
Ballesteros, a convicted Honduran drug kingpin; Juan Jose Bernabe
Ramirez, a former Mexican homicide officer and Javier Vasquez
Velasco, who is accused of murdering two American tourists in an
apparent mistake killing.
   The DEA has vowed to capture every person involved in the
Camarena slaying. So far, 22 people have been charged in this
country and more than 20 were convicted in Mexico.
   Jurors were also asked whether they had read about Antonio
Garate Bustamante, a former Mexican police officer who said he
arranged the abduction of Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain, another
defendant in the Camarena killing.
   The alleged kidnapping strained U.S. relations with Mexico,
where President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has called the action a
violation of Mexican sovereignty.
   Rafeedie, presiding over separate proceedings in the doctor's
case, has demanded to know how Alvarez was brought here from Mexico
and has set a May 25 hearing on the matter. Alvarez's trial has
been indefinitely delayed pending that hearing.

   Roman Catholic Cardinal Tomas
O'Fiaich, the primate of all Ireland and an ardent Irish
nationalist, died Tuesday after falling ill on a pilgrimage to
Lourdes, France, the church announced. He was 66.
   The cardinal, who was head of the church in both the Republic of
Ireland and Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland, died of cardiac
arrest in a hospital at Toulouse, 95 miles from Lourdes, officials
said.
   An announcement of the death, issued by the church's press
office in both Belfast and Dublin, said O'Fiaich had appeared
unwell to doctors accompanying the group of 600 pilgrims from his
seat at Armagh in Northern Ireland.
   Lourdes is a Catholic shrine where a peasant girl reported a
vision of the Virgin Mary in 1858. Miraculous cures have been
reported there.
   The cardinal was admitted first to hospital in Lourdes, then
flown by helicopter to Toulouse. Philippe Giovanni, director of the
Rangueil Hospital there, said O'Fiaich died of a ``brutal cardiac
arrest'' soon after being admitted.
   While calling for a unified Ireland and criticizing British
policy in Northern Ireland, O'Fiaich, whose name was pronounced
O'Fee, also castigated the violence of the Irish Republican Army.
   The predominantly Catholic outlawed guerrilla army seeks to end
British rule in Northern Ireland and unite it with the Irish
Republic.
   ``You can't unite people with bombs and bullets,'' the cardinal
once said.
   He was appointed spiritual leader of Ireland's 4 million
Catholics in in 1977. Two years later Pope John Paul II made
O'Fiaich one of the first cardinals of his papacy.
   Tributes to O'Fiaich poured in from some both sides of the Irish
border.
   In Dublin, Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey said he was
``devastated, ... deeply grieved.''
   Britain's top official in Northern Ireland also expressed
sadness. ``We did not always agree about everything, but he treated
me with the greatest possible courtesy, friendliness and warmth,''
said Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Brooke.
   However, the Rev. Martin Smyth, a legislator in the British
Parliament for the Ulster Unionists, said his party hoped
O'Fiaich's death will give Catholics ``a more positive spritual
leadership and a less Republican stance.''
   In Belfast, Ulster Television suspended scheduled programs for
an hour and aired a religious program and a news program about the
cardinal.
   O'Fiaich was born Thomas Fee in Cullyhanna, in south Armagh,
within sight of the border with the Irish Republic. He changed his
name to the Gaelic form as his love of the Irish language and
nationalist sentiments developed.
   O'Fiaich retained close ties to Armagh, which has been dubbed
``bandit country'' because of the IRA activity.
   From the time he became primate, he spoke publicly of his wishes
for a united Ireland. He visited IRA guerrillas in jail, called the
British Army's fatal shooting of an Irish civilian murder, and said
the border dividing Ireland was ``unnatural.''

<HEAD>Two Americans Reported Arrested in Vietnam</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two Americans, one of them a Hong
Kong-based publisher, have been arrested by Vietnamese authorities
and are being held in Ho Chi Minh City, friends said Tuesday.
   Friends of publisher Michael Morrow, who said they have been in
touch with Vietnamese authorities, said the two were being held on
unspecified charges. Morrow's colleagues spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Official media in Vietnam have made no mention of the arrests.
   State Department spokesman Martin Judge said Tuesday in
Washington that the department had been informed through unofficial
channels of one American being arrested in Vietnam on April 20. He
said he did not have that person's name, and knew nothing of other
arrests.
   The embassy in Bangkok has applied to visit the arrested
American, but Judge knows of no reply yet.
   ``We have had a travel advisory against travel to Vietnam since
May 1988 because we cannot offer consular services and no third
country represents U.S. interests in Vietnam,'' Judge noted.
   Friends of Morrow said he and an unidentified American were on
trip to look into possible investments in Vietnam when they were
arrested.
   A third person, French businessman Terry Rodzynk, was also
arrested but subsequently released and allowed to leave the
country, they said.
   The group was seized in the central Vietnam city of Danang and
taken to Ho Chi Minh City, Morrow's friends said.
   Morrow has an association with Vietnam dating to the war, when
he started a private news service in the country. He was captured
by Communist forces during the war but was released after a short
captivity.
   A longtime resident of Hong Kong, Morrow is the publisher of
Petroleum News, an industry journal focused on Asia's energy
sector. He also heads Asia 2000 Ltd., a publishing house, and a
trading company in Hong Kong.

   The rain-swollen Arkansas River
on Tuesday reached a record level, forcing residents into unusual
living arrangements, such as the 17 people from four families
sharing Sandy Pratt's house.
   ``I'm just glad they all have a place to go,'' said Mrs. Pratt,
whose 13 neighbors moved in last week after the Arkansas River
flooded. ``As long as we're dry on this hill, they have a place to
eat and sleep and get clean.''
   That means eating in shifts, stepping over sleeping bodies,
standing in line for the bathroom and hearing the unending whirr of
washer and dryer.
   The river reached a record 27.6 feet at Little Rock, 4 feet
above flood stage, forcing an estimated 325 families from their
homes.
   In Texas, the Trinity River caused the region's worst flooding
in 80 years, with more than 1,600 people seeking shelter. Tuesday
afternoon, Gov. Bill Clements authorized the Texas National Guard
to send 50 soldiers to shore up a levee on the Red River near
Texarkana that was weakening.
   Oklahoma's Lake Texoma, which crested 27 feet above normal, has
forced hundreds of people to evacuate.
   In the past two weeks, floods contributed to the deaths of 13
people in Texas and one in Oklahoma.
   Officials said the flooding along the Arkansas River was the
worst since a 1927 rampage that prompted construction of many of
the levees along the river.
   Mrs. Pratt, who grew up in the neighborhood where she now lives
with her husband and two children, said she was going grocery
shopping Friday night when she learned relatives and others down
the street were being told to leave.
   ``I told my mother, `Well, I guess I'd better go (to the grocery
store) because it looks like I'm going to have company.'''
   The company included her parents, her sister's family of three
and another neighbor's family of eight. The Wombles, the Irvings
and the Carrolls spent the night packing their belongings into
rented trucks. On Saturday morning, when the trucks were parked on
higher ground, they moved in with the Pratts.
   ``You can imagine trying to cook for 17 people,'' said Mrs.
Pratt. ``We eat in shifts.''
   Her sister, Vicki Carroll, added: ``We all kind of line up
around the coffee pot and at the refrigerator.''
   Many of their meals have been provided by the Salvation Army,
which has a vendor's truck set up at the end of the block. ``As
soon as they see us up, they come down with sausage and biscuits
and coffee,'' Mrs. Pratt said.
   Sleeping bags, the couch and a pop-up camper in the back yard
have been used for bed space. ``There were bodies everywhere,''
said Eunice Womble, Mrs. Pratt's mother.
   Getting into the bathroom also has been difficult. ``It's almost
time to go to bed by the time we all get clean,'' she said. ``We
have two bathrooms, so that helped.''
   The biggest problem has been laundry, she said.
   ``My washer and dryer ... go constantly.''
   The experience has not been unpleasant, they said.
   ``We had a cookout,'' said Mrs. Pratt.
   ``We had a big kickball game in the back yard,'' said Mrs.
Womble.
   ``And my flower bed,'' Mrs. Pratt said with a laugh. ``They used
my flower bed as a base.''
   Officials say it could be Thursday before evacuated families are
allowed to return home.
   ``We were in the midst of remodeling,'' said Mrs. Carroll. ``My
husband took a two-week vacation, and this is what he got.''
   Her husband, Steve, and father, Forrest Womble, helped National
Guardsmen, city crews and other volunteers who worked through the
night Monday to reinforce levees. Mrs. Carroll said she recorded it
all on videotape.
   ``My husband said we can look back on it and laugh,'' she said.
``I didn't think it was too funny at the time, but maybe later.''

   Nineteen European and moderate Arab countries on
Tuesday urged that the PLO's bid to make its self-declared State of
Palestine a full voting member of the World Health Organization be
put on hold indefinitely.
   In a draft resolution to the U.N. agency's annual assembly, the
countries, including Egypt and Morocco, called on WHO's
director-general, Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima, to continue studying the
issue and report back ``at an appropriate time.''
   But Iraq indicated it would try to force a vote on the issue.
   The move followed renewed U.S. threats to cut off all funding to
WHO if its 167-nation assembly approved the application by the
Palestine Liberation Organization. Such a move would boost the
PLO's campaign for international recognition of its state.
   The State Department maintains the PLO is not entitled to full
membership in any U.N. organization because it does not meet
internationally recognized criteria of statehood, including control
of territory.
   ``We should use political means to attain health objectives, but
not health issues to serve political ends,'' Nakajima told
delegates attending the two-week meeting that opened Monday.
   Although the assembly is due to discuss issues such as
nutrition, poverty and health risks from hazardous wastes, the PLO
application topped the agenda. It was scheduled for consideration
Thursday.
   Nakajima has warned that WHO would have to slash all its
important programs if the United States withdrew its funding,
including the fight against tropical diseases, AIDS, and child
vaccination programs.
   The United States is pledged to contribute $78 million to WHO
this year, or 25 percent of the agency's regular budget. Washington
also provides much of the funding for programs outside the regular
budget, such as the campaign against AIDS.
   A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said funds
would stop immediately if the PLO were admitted.
   The draft resolution was sponsored by Austria, Denmark, Egypt,
Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Morocco, New
Zealand, Oman, Pakistan, Portugal, Senegal, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland and Yugoslavia.
   More than 100 countries, many in the Third World, have
recognized the independent Palestinian state declared by the
movement's parliament-in-exile, the Palestine National Council, in
November 1988.
   The Palestinian state roughly encompasses the Israeli-occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip though no boundaries have been declared.
   In a letter to Nakajima last month, the PLO warned the assembly
against yielding to ``pressure and political blackmail by the
United States and Israel.''
   The PLO currently has non-voting observer status with WHO.

   Blacks who paralyzed Selma's school system
after a white-dominated vote to fire the city's first black
superintendant promised Tuesday to keep the protest going, despite
his decision to quit for $150,000.
   Schools Superintendant Norward Roussell, 55, announced his
resignation Monday after accepting $150,000 to drop a $10 million
lawsuit against the white-majority school board contesting his
dismissal as racial discrimation.
   ``This issue in Selma is larger than Dr. Roussell,'' said Dallas
County Commissioner Perry Varner, a black protest leader who on
Sunday completed a five-day jail term for contempt of court.
   ``We don't see this as a sell-out,'' he said of the settlement
in this focal point of the civil rights movement. ``It's a victory
for us.''
   In December, the board voted 6-5, along racial lines, not to
renew Roussell's contract when it expires June 30, the end of his
third year.
   Roussell's supporters contend he was fired because of his race.
His critics cite an evaluation that said he lacked managerial
skills. Roussell said the evaluation was unsubstantiated.
   The months since the board's vote have been marked by marches,
picketing, sit-ins and school boycotts by black adults and students
who said Roussell's firing was racist. All schools in the
6,000-student public system were closed for about a week in
February. Dozens of people have been arrested for violating court
orders limiting the protests.
   But daily the demonstrators have returned to City Hall.
   Varner said he and others would continue to push for an elected
school board to preside over a public school system that now is 80
percent black. The system has shrunk to about 5,700 students after
some 300, mostly white, pulled out amid the racial turmoil.
   The school board currently is appointed by the City Council,
which also has a white majority. This city of 25,000 is about half
white, half black.
   ``The majority of the people here are good people who want the
best for themselves and want the best for their children,''
Roussell said in an interview prior to his resignation. ``But like
any town, you've got politics and racism. Racism feeds the
politics, and politics feeds the racism.''
   Conflict-weary students hoped to be free of both during the
upcoming summer vacation.
   ``It used to be perfect,'' said Carlos Browning, a black,
17-year-old, Selma High School junior. ``Now it seems like white
kids are afraid to talk to blacks.''
   The three-month vacation, which begins June 1, ``will give
everyone time to cool down so things can get back to normal next
year,'' Browning said.
   Jim Walker, a white senior who transferred from Selma High
School to Central High School in Tuscaloosa, said blacks and whites
``got along great'' until the protests.
   ``I had to get away from all this mess,'' said Walker. ``This
was supposed to be my best year and it's been my worst.''
   Roussell's departure left at least one school board member
wondering if anyone can handle the racial conflicts and please the
whole community.
   ``I would be afraid to apply for this job,'' said Sheila Okoye,
a black board member who had opposed Roussell's firing.
   ``Whoever gets the job is going to be in hot water. ... If a
black one comes in and all the white people like him, the black
people are going to wonder what he's selling,'' she said.
   ``If he's a white one, black people are going to feel that he's
getting the job because he'll do what the white community wants him
to do.''
   A white board member, Dick Bean, said he feels the board can now
``move forward in a positive manner.''
   He said an interim superintendent would be chosen and a search
begun for a permanent one.

   Hopes raised by the release of two American
hostages in Lebanon have turned to frustration for families of
British captives, and some are demanding a conciliatory gesture
from author Salman Rushdie.
   David Waite, the brother of hostage Terry Waite, has said
Rushdie should apologize for his book, ``The Satanic Verses,''
which many Moslems consider blasphemous to Islam.
   The father of hostage John McCarthy was quoted as saying ``The
Satanic Verses'' should never have been published.
   Rushdie's defenders say it is unfair to blame the British author
for the plight of the hostages. Most of them were kidnapped before
the publication of the book in September 1988 and the subsequent
decree issued against the author by Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini. The religious decree, or ``fatwa,'' called for Rushdie's
death on grounds the book blasphemed Islam.
   Despite this, a Gallup poll published Tuesday in The Daily
Telegraph found broad public support for some sort of gesture from
Rushdie. Of the people queried, 58 percent said Rushdie should
apologize to Moslems, and 36 percent thought he should withdraw the
book.
   Rushdie has been in hiding since Khomeini's decree was issued in
February 1989. In an interview from hiding last month with BBC
radio, he said it was not his reponsibility to end the controversy
over the book. ``The people who are attacking me have the business
of solving the problem,'' he said.
   He also told the interviewer the question was ``unfair,''
sounding exasperated.
   Iran broke diplomatic relations with Britain after Khomeini's
decree.
   Syria was a broker in gaining the release of the two Americans
last month _ Robert Polhill and Frank Reed. However, Britain broke
relations with Syria in 1986 over the Syrian Embassy's alleged role
in attempting to bomb an Israeli airliner in London.
   The lack of diplomatic ties with Iran and Syria has been cited
as a key obstacle to the release of Waite, the archbishop of
Canterbury's special envoy; journalist John McCarthy; retired pilot
Jack Mann; and teacher Brian Keenan,who has dual Irish and British
citizenship.
   Paul Handley, Archbishop Robert Runcie's press secretary, said
Tuesday night the Anglican leader is considering meeting Sayed
Quddus, a leading British Moslem, who says Waite is alive and well.
   Quddus, president of a Moslem group in Bradford, northern
England, requested the meeting. He said he was told in Iran
recently that while Waite was well and in good spirits, he would be
freed only in exchange for Rushdie.
   Mann, who disappeared May 12, 1989, is the only British hostage
to disappear since the Rushdie controversy erupted.
   Mann's wife, Sunnie, 78, flew to London Tuesday and said she
thought the British government could be doing more to help the
missing Britons.
   ``I think they could be doing a bit more to help the hostages,
but I am not in politics _ it is not my line,'' she said at
London's Heathrow airport.
   Peter Temple-Morris, a Conservative Party lawmaker who chairs
the Anglo-Iranian Parliamentary group, said last week that Rushdie
should consider ``the effect he is having on British-Iranian
relations and also the effect he is having on the British
hostages.''
   He urged Rushdie not to further postpone a decision about
publishing a paperback edition of ``The Satanic Verses'' _ either
publish and get it over with, or cancel it, Temple-Morris said.
   George Foulkes, the opposition Labor Party's foreign affairs
spokesman, said if Rushdie scrapped the paperback and apologized,
it would help the hostages.
   Rushdie has said he wants a paperback, but publisher Viking
Penguin has not announced a decision.
   Frances D'Souza, who chairs the International Committee for the
Defense of Salman Rushdie and His Publishers, said the hostages'
families have been frustrated by the government's lack of a
``strong, energetic, forceful policy.''
   She said she understood the families' ``tremendous
frustrations'' but warned that giving in to Iran's demands on
Rushdie ``would set a dangerous precedent. What will they ask next,
that we extradite Mr. Rushdie?''
   An editorial Tuesday in The Independent newspaper said Rushdie
has already apologized for the ``shock and pain'' caused by his
novel. This was a reference to an essay Rushdie wrote in which he
expressed regret for the tensions the book had caused.
   In the essay that appeared in the Independent on Sunday weekly
newspaper, Rushdie said he never intended to blaspheme Islam but
recognized that many Moslems were shocked and pained by his book.
   Among the scenes Moslems found offensive were one in which
prostitutes are given the names of the wives of the prophet
Mohammed. The book also implies that Mohammed wrote the Koran, the
Moslem holy book, instead of it being dictated by Allah.

<HEAD>Abuses Continue in Turkey, Amnesty International Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Widespread torture and other abuses continue
unabated in Turkey six months after the government proposed new
human rights safeguards, according to a report by Amnesty
International.
   ``In early 1990, thousands of people remained imprisoned for
political reasons, including hundreds of prisoners of conscience
convicted for their non-violent political or religious
activities,'' the international human rights organization said in a
report being released Wednesday.
   ``Among them are members of political organizations, trade
unions and Kurdish groups as well as journalists and religious
activists. The use of torture continues to be widespread and
systematic, in some cases resulting in death.''
   Turkey ratified the United Nations Convention against Torture in
1988, the report said.
   In September and November last year, the government announced
proposals governing length of detention, access to lawyers and
protection for prisoners of conscience. None of those proposals has
been enacted.
   Under the government proposal, the maximum detention period
under police custody would be reduced from 15 days to four to 10
days, though longer detention would be permitted under emergency
legislation.
   The government also proposed abolishing the death penalty for 13
categories of offenses, but not for murder and political offenses
that produce the most death sentences, the report said.
   ``While these draft amendments, if passed, would represent a
step in the right direction, they nevertheless would fall short of
international standards in important respects,'' Amnesty
International said.
   The report included testimony from several prisoners who said
they were tortured with beatings on the soles of their feet,
electric shocks, showers of ice cold water and being hung by their
arms.
   ``Torture is still routine even among those detained for only a
few days,'' Amnesty reported.
   The testimony of prisoners shows ``anyone is at risk from
torture in Turkey, particularly if held on political grounds,'' the
report said.
   ``Many prisoners sign confessions under torture which are then
used as evidence against them, in violation of international
standards,'' it said.

<HEAD>`Hamlet,' Starring Kevin Kline, Opens Off-Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There wasn't much doubt that Kevin Kline could
play Hamlet.
   He did it four years ago at the New York Shakespeare Festival in
an odd, uneven production directed by Liviu Ciulei. Its biggest
plus was Kline, who offered a thoughtful, clear-spoken but
low-keyed portrait of the Danish prince.
   Now ``Hamlet'' and Kline are together again for a second time as
part of the festival's six-year marathon of all of Shakespeare's
plays. In addition to playing the title character, Kline now has
taken on the task of directing the play himself.
   Kline the director may not yet be the equal of Kline the actor,
but he has done a respectable job. This is a no-nonsense, cleanly
performed ``Hamlet,'' done with a minimum of production clutter. In
this version, the text is all, and no one speaks it better than
Kline.
   Kline the actor has improved since his last outing. He's more
relaxed, freer and a little looser with the play's tragedy _ and
moments of comedy _ than he was in 1986. Yet he doesn't neglect the
poetry that is such an important part of the role.
   This Hamlet has more passion than Kline's previous incarnation.
He grieves openly for his dead father. His outrage at his mother's
marriage to his uncle is fiercer. His relentless humiliation of
Ophelia is more unnerving, almost sadistic. His wit and bitter
sense of humor is more sharply defined, particularly in the
gravedigger's scene when he ruminates on the nature of life and
death. And his realization of what he must do to avenge his
father's death is more carefully plotted out. It builds
appropriately to a bloody climax that seems inevitable from what
has gone before.
   Kline has staged the play simply with few props and the barest
of stage sets, just a burgundy curtain hanging on a back wall. The
costumes are modern dress. When Hamlet first appears _ wearing a
buttoned-up white shirt with a high collar and a black suit _ he
looks like a refugee from one of New York's downtown rock clubs.
Claudius, done up in red sash and a blue military uniform,
resembles an admiral in dry dock. And Gertrude wears a ballgown
that would be just as appropriate at the Plaza as at Elsinore.
   There are a few awkward touches. The play-within-a-play is oddly
staged with Claudius and Gertrude on the platform with the actors
who are reenacting Claudius' crime. And the duel at the end of the
evening seems cramped on the Anspacher Theater's small playing
area. The fight almost careens into the audience.
   For the most part, the play has been cast with remarkable care.
Brian Murray is an unctuous Claudius, who nevertheless manages to
generate some sympathy for his nasty predictament.
   Dana Ivey _ in the play's most thankless role _ is a regal,
unyielding Gertrude, while Diane Venora is a vulnerable Ophelia
able to make the character's famous mad scene shattering rather
than silly. Best of all is Joseph Sommer's Polonius, priggish
without being petulant and whose death can be seen as a loss even
by Hamlet.
   Kline is a generous actor-director, allowing each performer,
down to the smallest role, a chance to shine. But what makes this
an enriching ``Hamlet'' is Kline's fidelity to the play itself as
an actor and now as a director.

<TEXT>
   A white teen-aged murder defendant was a
``jerk'' to pick up a bat and go after four young blacks to protect
his neighborhood, but it was not his fault one of the blacks was
shot to death, his lawyer said Tuesday.
   Prosecutors, however, said the defendant, Keith Mondello, was
accountable because he organized the white mob that surrounded and
trapped Yusuf Hawkins, 16, in the moments before Hawkins was shot
Aug. 23 in Brooklyn.
   After final arguments Tuesday, the jury was charged by Justice
Thaddeus Owens of Brooklyn's state Supreme Court. Jurors began
deliberating at 5:30 p.m.
   A second panel already was weighing the case against Joseph
Fama, the accused gunman in the Hawkins killing. The cases were
tried in the same courtroom but heard by separate juries.
   Both juries retired for the night at about 7 p.m.
   Fama and Mondello, both 19, would face 25 years to life in
prison if convicted of murder.
   Outside the courthouse Tuesday, about a dozen protesters
chanting ``Justice for Yusuf'' were arrested for disorderly conduct.
   In his closing argument, Mondello's lawyer Stephen Murphy said
the incident was not motivated by race and sought to place the
blame on a local young woman, Gina Feliciano, for inviting black
and Hispanic ``drug-dealer'' friends to a party in the mostly white
Bensonhurst neighborhood.
   He said Mondello believed the blacks were coming to attack the
local whites.
   ``Everyone's going to say Gina's not the cause of this. That's
garbage,'' Murphy said. ``She put the wheels in motion.''
   But Assistant District Attorney Paul Burns said it was
preposterous for Mondello and the gang he assembled ``to believe
they had the right to arm themselves and go out on a public
street'' to protect their neighborhood.
   Burns said the bat-wielding white mob stalked and surrounded
Hawkins and his three black friends, and pushed Hawkins into a
doorway.
   After one of the whites, allegedly Fama, pulled an automatic
pistol and fired four shots, the white mob scattered without
pausing to help their fatally wounded victim, Burns said.
   ``Like a mob they came, like a mob they left. Group courage
masking individual cowardice,'' he said.
   Burns charged that Mondello organized, armed and set in motion
the actions of the mob.
   ``That's depraved indifference to human life,'' he said, urging
a murder conviction for Mondello. ``He's responsible under the
law.''
   Murphy called Hawkins' shooting ``a horrible thing,'' but argued
that Mondello, who admitted he was at the scene with a baseball
bat, had nothing to do with it.
   ``As they were walking away, some lunatic comes out and shoots
him,'' Murphy said.
   He said Mondello was foolish to believe Miss Feliciano's threat
and foolish to sign a police statement confessing to his role in
the attack.
   ``He is a jerk,'' Murphy said. ``He let her make a jerk out of
him. He let the cops make a jerk out of him. But it's no crime to
be a jerk.''
   Mondello is charged with two counts of murder, two counts of
manslaughter, three counts of unlawful imprisonment, three counts
of menacing, one count of riot, four counts of discrimination and
one count of weapon possession.

<TEXT>
   Anti-Semitism is rising in the Soviet Union in
the age of glasnost, according to two surveys released to Congress
on Tuesday.
   In one survey, 77 percent of the people polled in Moscow said
they thought most of their countrymen were anti-Jewish and 60
percent believed some Soviets harbored such feelings.
   The survey, released by the American Jewish Committee, found 48
percent of the respondents believe anti-Jewish sentiment is
increasing in the Soviet Union, while 44 percent said such feelings
were unchanged. Five percent said anti-Semitism was declining.
   The poll, of 506 randomly chosen Moscow adults, found 91 percent
of the respondents thought Jews should be alllowed to decide for
themselves whether to emigrate.
   The American Jewish Committee, along with the National Science
Foundation, the University of Houston and the Soviet Academy of
Sciences, paid for the poll.
   The likely uncertainty in a sample of 506 people would be more
than four percentage points either way, according to a standard
statistical calculation.
   Another survey, conducted by the Jewish Research Center of the
Soviet Sociological Association in Moscow, focused on about 500
Soviet Jewish leaders.
   About 73 percent said they had experienced or witnessed an act
of anti-Semitism in the last six months of 1989.
   The polls were released at a hearing of the Congressional Human
Rights Caucus.
   Richard Schifter, the assistant secretary of state, said
official anti-Semitism has declined since Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev instituted reforms in 1986.
   At the same time, liberalization inside the Soviet Union has
allowed ``groups pressing the anti-Semitic case'' to become more
visible.
   The number of Jews leaving the Soviet Union has increased
dramatically, with thousands leaving the country each month. In
1989, 71,000 Jews emigrated, up from 914 in 1986.

   Roman Catholic Cardinal Tomas O
Fiaich, the primate of all Ireland and an ardent Irish nationalist,
died Tuesday after falling ill on a pilgrimage to Lourdes, France,
the church announced. He was 66.
   The cardinal, who was head of the church in both the Republic of
Ireland and Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland, died of cardiac
arrest in a hospital at Toulouse, 95 miles from Lourdes, officials
said.
   An announcement of the death, issued by the church's press
office in both Belfast and Dublin, said O Fiaich had appeared
unwell to doctors accompanying the group of 600 pilgrims from his
seat at Armagh in Northern Ireland.
   Lourdes is a Catholic shrine where a peasant girl reported a
vision of the Virgin Mary in 1858. Miraculous cures have been
reported there.
   The cardinal was admitted first to hospital in Lourdes, then
flown by helicopter to Toulouse. Philippe Giovanni, director of the
Rangueil Hospital there, said O Fiaich died of a ``brutal cardiac
arrest'' soon after being admitted.
   While calling for a unified Ireland and criticizing British
policy in Northern Ireland, O Fiaich, whose name was pronounced
O'Fee, also castigated the violence of the Irish Republican Army.
   The predominantly Catholic outlawed guerrilla army seeks to end
British rule in Northern Ireland and unite it with the Irish
Republic.
   ``You can't unite people with bombs and bullets,'' the cardinal
once said.
   He was appointed spiritual leader of Ireland's 4 million
Catholics in in 1977. Two years later Pope John Paul II made O
Fiaich one of the first cardinals of his papacy.
   Tributes to O Fiaich poured in from some both sides of the Irish
border.
   In Dublin, Irish Prime inister Charles Haughey said he was
``devastated, ... deeply grieved.''
   Britain's top official in Northern Ireland also expressed
sadness. ``We did not always agree about everything, but he treated
me with the greatest possible courtesy, friendliness and warmth,''
said Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Brooke.
   But hardline Protestant leader Ian Paisley of Northern Ireland's
Democratic Unionist Party, said O Fiaich was ``the mallet of Rome
against the Protestants of Northern Ireland.''
   He claimed O Fiaich had ``made an outrageous statement that the
majority of bigotry in Ulster stemmed from the Protestant section
of the community'' and added: ``He did not seem to realize that the
IRA, which is carrying out the most atrocious of outrages ... were
the people who needed to be indicted with bigotry.''
   In Belfast, Ulster Television suspended scheduled programs for
an hour and aired a religious program and a news program about the
cardinal.
   O Fiaich was born Thomas Fee in Cullyhanna, in south Armagh,
within sight of the border with the Irish Republic. He changed his
name to the Gaelic form as his love of the Irish language and
nationalist sentiments developed.
   O Fiaich retained close ties to Armagh, which has been dubbed
``bandit country'' because of the IRA activity.
   From the time he became primate, he spoke publicly of his wishes
for a united Ireland. He visited IRA guerrillas in jail, called the
British Army's fatal shooting of an Irish civilian murder, and said
the border dividing Ireland was ``unnatural.''

<HEAD>Frito-Lay Must Pay Singer Tom Waits $2.5 Million for Imitating Him</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Frito-Lay inc. must pay singer Tom Waits
almost $2.5 million for imitating his gravelly style in a radio
commercial hawking corn chips, a federal court jury decided Tuesday.
   ``Now I have a fence and a gate around my voice,'' Waits said
following the verdict.
   The jury deliberated abut eight hours over two days before
deciding Waits should receive $2,475,000. The entertainer's lawyer
had asked for $1.5 million.
   ``This was a humiliation to Mr. Waits. They picked on the wrong
guy,'' said Waits attorney Howard King.
   Waits, 40, was portrayed as a street poet with a loyal following
who had refused all offers to do commercials, turning down such
corporations as Honda, Kraft and Burger King.
   Many of his songs are paeans to gritty life at the margin,
describing nighthawks at the diner, truck drivers, hard drinkers
and prostitutes in dingy worlds filled with cigarette smoke.
   Frito-Lay attorney Anthony Liebig argued Waits wasn't well-known
enough to be imitated.
   ``There is no question he is widely known to extreme insiders in
the rock industry but that has nothing to do with being known by
the broader segment of the population,'' Liebig said.
   Waits sued Frito-Lay and ad agency Tracy-Locke Inc., which hired
Dallas singer Stephen Carter to launch ads for its Salsa Rio Doitos
in September 1988.
   He sued in U.S. District Court under federal trademark laws and
under a California common law, established in a case involving
Bette Midler, that outlaws imitating a professional singer's
distinctive voice for commercial use.
   ``I was shocked,'' Waits testified during the trial when asked
his reaction to hearing the corn chip commercial for the first
time. ``I think he studied me closely. I heard things I do with my
voice that I've never heard anyone else do, a certain intimacy.''
   Waits said Carter copied ``my phrasing, my timbre, my voice, my
approach.''
   ``It embarrassed me,'' he testified. ``I had to call my friends
and tell them, `If you hear this thing, please be informed it's not
me.' I was on the phone for days. And people kept calling me.''
   Waits has been featured on such albums as ``Franks Wild Years,''
``Rain Dogs,'' ``Swordfish Trombones'' and ``Closing Time.'' He has
also been an opening performer for such acts as Frank Zappa.
   The singer-composer also contributed to the motion picture score
of ``One From the Heart,'' and he appeared in the films ``Rumble
Fish'' and ``Cotton Club.''

<TEXT>
   Columbia's scheduled launch next
week with the $100 million Astro observatory could be delayed days
or even weeks because of a problem with the shuttle's cooling
system, NASA said Tuesday.
   Engineers ``need time to assess the situation,'' said NASA
administrator Richard Truly. ``I don't see it to be an
earth-shattering problem.''
   The launch had been scheduled for May 16 or May 17.
   If a valve that doesn't seem to be working properly has to be
changed, NASA would prefer doing that at the launch pad, Truly
said. The procedure has never been performed there, however, and
officials are uncertain how many days that might take.
   Bascom Murrah, a NASA official in charge of prelaunch operations
for Columbia, estimated it would be a ``10-day to two-week hit.''
   ``It's a big job,'' Murrah said. ``You would have to drain the
system (of coolant) and clean it.''
   Rolling the shuttle back to its hangar to change the valve or
another part of the cooling system, such as a filter, would mean an
even longer delay, Truly said. Two shuttles already are in the
hangar _ Atlantis and the newly returned Discovery _ and work on
them would be disrupted, he said.
   ``It's hard for me to speculate because I don't know if we have
to change anything,'' Truly said. But, he added, ``We'll think a
long time before we decide not to fix it on the pad.''
   The valve in question, in one of Columbia's two Freon cooling
loops, controls the proportion and rate of Freon distributed
between the crew cabin heat exchanger and the cooling system for
payloads.
   Engineers on Sunday saw an unexplained change in the flow of
coolant, NASA said.
   ``The system is still operating with a reduced flow, and
engineers are reviewing data on the system and conducting
trouble-shooting activities,'' the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration said in a statement.
   ``In parallel with trouble-shooting, managers are also assessing
what would be required to change the valve and where that activity
would be performed,'' the agency said.
   NASA managers are reviewing the situation at the two-day Flight
Readiness Review meeting, which began Tuesday. The agency had hoped
to confirm a launch date by the end of the meeting Wednesday.
   Columbia's nine- to 10-day flight will be the first Spacelab
mission since 1985. Four astronomers who are part of the seven-man
crew will operate the on-board observatory, which will probe
sources of ultraviolet and X-ray radiation.
   Up to 100 mission managers and other officials, meanwhile, went
through a simulated shuttle accident Tuesday to test emergency
procedures and better prepare for a real-life disaster.
   ``It worked better than we thought it would,'' said William
Lenoir, head of NASA's space flight program. ``There were very few
lessons.''
   During the 1{-hour exercise at Kennedy Space Center, television
monitors showed a shuttle returning to the launch site shortly
after liftoff. The shuttle in the video veered off the runway,
injuring two of five astronauts.
   The simulated problems included main engine shutdown less than
two minutes into the flight, a leaking power unit, inability to
purge the shuttle's hydrogen lines and excessive winds. Such
failures, when combined, are ``extremely unlikely,'' Lenoir said.
   Truly said a series of simulated shuttle accidents are planned
``to make sure the communications loops are in place.''
   An accident on board an orbiting shuttle will be simulated at
Johnson Space Center in Houston around late June, followed by a
mock crash landing at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., in August.

<TEXT>
   Eighty Contra rebels turned in
their weapons Tuesday to U.N. peacekeeping troops on the first day
of their demobilization after nearly a decade of battle. A rebel
leader said glumly: ``We did not have the ending we all wanted.''
   The disarming was the first under an accord reached last week
between the government of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro and
the leadership of the Nicaraguan Resistance, the Contra umbrella
organization.
   Many of the weapons turned in Tuesday were old and rusty, and
some of the fighters were pre-adolescent boys in olive-green
uniforms several sizes too big.
   ``All beginnings are difficult,'' said Jose Pallais, vice
minister of security forces in the new government.
   The U.S.-backed Contras had waged a nine-year insurgency against
the leftist Sandinista government, defeated in elections by Mrs.
Chamorro's coalition. She took office April 25.
   The disarmament process is to continue until June 10.
   Armando Orozco Guzman, 28, was the first Contra to formally
disarm. He turned in a battered AK-47 assault rifle that he claimed
he had used during his five years with the rebels.
   Orozco was photographed for a temporary identification card to
use until he receives permanent identity papers from the Nicaraguan
government. An Organization of American States representative
registered his name and identification number.
   He picked up new, civilian clothes _ blue denim pants, a cotton
short-sleeved shirt, underwear, socks and boots _ and turned in his
uniform, which OAS representatives burned.
   Then he stood in line, waiting for a truck to take him home.
   U.N. officials said there are about 13,800 rebels in seven
security zones that were set up throughout the country for the
demobilization.
   El Almendro, a dozen wooden homes on the banks of a small river,
is the assembly point in Security Zone 5, which straddles Rio San
Juan province, 180 miles southeast of Managua.
   U.N. officials said there were about 1,600 Contras in Zone 5 but
that more were coming in from the surrounding countryside.
   ``We did not have the ending we all wanted _ to do away with the
uncertainty that remains in all the nation,'' Israel Galeano, the
top Contra commander, told troops standing at attention under a
broiling noon sun.
   ``But we will be strong as long as we remain united,'' he added.
   Galeano and other Contra leaders had objected strongly to Mrs.
Chamorro's temporary retention of Gen. Humberto Ortega, brother of
Sandinista former president Daniel Ortega, as commander-in-chief of
Nicaragua's armed forces.
   The Contras had demanded Gen. Ortega and all other Sandinistas
be removed from the military before they disarmed. That demand was
not mentioned in the two-page accord signed Friday.
   ``Today, those who deposit their weapons should not be afraid _
you are not alone,'' Galeano told the troops. ``We are not doing it
in exchange for a ration or a pair of shoes. We are doing it to
help the nation.''
   After fighting the Sandinistas since 1981, the Contras have
agreed to return to civilian life while the Sandinistas remain in
control of the army.
   Galeano told his soldiers those wanting to disarm voluntarily
should step aside and do so. Only 80 of the assembled troops did.
   The OAS will provide non-lethal aid to the Contras after they
hand their rifles over to the U.N. peacekeepers.
   Most of the weapons turned in were Soviet-made AK-47 rifles. In
a warehouse, the rifles were being split into two or three pieces.
Mines and grenades were to be destroyed elsewhere.
   On hand for the disarming were Gen. Agustin Quesada of Spain,
who heads of U.N. peacekeeping troops, and representatives of Mrs.
Chamorro and Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo.

   Oliver North met with then-Vice President
George Bush a few hours after lying to the House intelligence
committee about assisting the Nicaraguan Contras, an entry in
North's White House diaries suggests.
   Portions of the diaries, released Tuesday, renew questions about
whether Bush was more deeply involved in assisting the Contras than
he has acknowledged.
   The 1,400 pages of notebook entries were obtained by a private
group, the National Security Archive, as the result of a lawsuit
filed against the government. U.S. intelligence agencies still are
reviewing the remaining 1,200 pages of North's diaries.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``The vice
president's role in the Iran-Contra affair was completely examined
in the congressional inquiry and we have nothing to add.''
   Among the disclosures in the newly released material:
   _On Dec. 20, 1985, North laid out a ``3rd Country Solicitation
Plan'' in support of the Contras that included trips by Bush to
Honduras for an inauguration there. The plan also called for
President Reagan to meet with Ecuador's president.
   Bush went to Honduras in January 1986 for the inauguration of
President Jose Azcona Hoyo and Reagan met in Washington that month
with Ecuadoran President Leon Febres Cordero.
   There was an elaborate plan in the Reagan administration to
induce third countries to support the Contras, according to
evidence introduced at North's trial last year. Bush has denied
being involved in any ``quid pro quo'' arrangements providing
additional economic and military aid to Honduras in exchange for
allowing the Contras to use base camps there.
   _North's notes refer to a noon ``meeting w V.P.'' on Aug. 6,
1986. That would have been just 3{ hours after North lied to the
House intelligence committee by denying he was supplying military
advice to the Contras. North admitted he had lied when he took the
witness stand at his own trial last year and when he testified in
the recent trial of former National Security Adviser John
Poindexter.
   Shortly before meeting with Bush, according to North's diaries,
the White House aide had a ``meeting w Don Gregg,'' Bush's top
national security aide.
   Gregg, now the U.S. ambassador to South Korea, has said he found
out about North's involvement with the then-secret Contra resupply
network on Aug. 8, 1986. Gregg asserts he didn't tell Bush about
North's involvement until four months later, after the Iran-Contra
affair became public.
   The notebooks provide offer no elaboration on the Aug. 6 meeting
entries. But earlier that day, the diaries show, North got a call
relating to problems in the Contra resupply operation. The call was
about Felix Rodriguez, a former CIA operative sent to El Salvador
with the blessing of Gregg.
   Rodriguez wound up working in North's Contra resupply network,
but had a falling out with him. Rodriguez complained to Gregg on
Aug. 8, 1986 that private operators were getting rich off of
North's network.
   U.S. Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., said he didn't believe Congress
had seen the page referring to Bush and Gregg and Aug. 6 meetings.
   ``It clearly at the very least would raise questions which ought
to have been put at the time to appropriate witnesses,'' Hamilton
said of the Aug. 6 entries. ``I would have if I had seen them.''
   The former House Iran-Contra committee chairman suggested that a
congressional investigation might be in order.
   ``If there is evidence relevant diaries were withheld, redacted
or blacked out then I would want'' the House intelligence or
judiciary committees to ``conduct an investigation,'' said Hamilton.
   ``I would expect the same of the independent counsel,'' he
added, referring to the Iran-Contra prosecutor's office.
   _North and others in the U.S. government who aren't identified
by name in his notes met with Panamanian Gen. Manuel Noriega in
March 1984, where the discussion focused on the role of Costa Rica
as a ``buffer'' between Nicaragua and Panama.
   _A March 6, 1984, entry focused on the ``vulnerabilities'' of
Roberto D'Aubuisson, referring to his ``inability to deliver U.S.
aid,'' saying he was a ``poor military officer'' and alleging he
``bumped off best friend.'' D'Aubuisson is the founder of Arena,
now the ruling party in El Salvador.
   ``What were the quids and the quos with all these countries?''
Tom Blanton, deputy director of the archive, asked at a news
conference. ``What did the vice president know and when did he know
it? How much did Don Gregg know?''
   The Justice Department released the new material from North's
notebooks in response to a lawsuit filed by the group and by Public
Citizen, a group founded by Ralph Nader.
   North still has the notebooks, but he supplied copies of 900
pages in 1987 to the Iran-Contra congressional committees. His
lawyers heavily censored the portions they turned over to Congress.
   Asked whether North attorney Brendan Sullivan had withheld
relevant material from the Iran-Contra congressional committees,
Blanton said, ``You bet.''
   Blanton cited a Jan. 5, 1984, entry stating, ``Costa Rica
project approved,'' a reference to planned military exercises and
other steps designed to counter the threat posed by Nicaragua. One
entry said that then-Costa Rican President Alberto Monge ``needs to
be stroked.''
   Reached by telephone at his office, Sullivan said that he has
not commented in the past on the Iran-Contra affair and would not
do so now.
   ``This material should never have been withheld from Congress in
the first place,'' said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., whose Senate
subcommittee investigated allegations of narcotics trafficking in
connection with the Contras.
   Kerry said the executive branch should produce the remainder of
the material ``without further delay.''
   North turned over copies of all 2,600 pages of his notebooks to
the Iran-Contra prosecutor's office at his trial last year.
Prosecutors did not object to the turning over of the new batch of
material to the private group.

   Indicted Mayor James L. Usry won a
runoff spot against City Councilman Jim Whelan in Tuesday's
non-partisan mayoral election, setting up a June 12 runoff in this
casino city.
   In final unofficial returns, Whelan had 3,481 votes, or 35
percent, to Usry's 2,906 votes, or 29 percent. Five other
candidates split the rest.
   Since no candidate received more than 50 percent of the vote,
the issue will be decided in a runoff. There are 35,400 year-round
residents of the city.
   Usry, the 68-year-old president of the National Conference of
Black Mayors, ran a low-budget campaign that sought to draw on his
longtime strength in the black community.
   He was indicted Jan. 3 on charges he illegally accepted $6,500
in an alleged scheme to bring rolling chairs to the Boardwalk. He
pleaded innocent and countered that the charges were trumped-up, in
part because he is black.
   Usry said he was not disappointed at finishing second. He said
the election proved he could overcome the ``taint and clouds'' of
his indictment, and he predicted victory next month.
   Speaking of the alleged crimes, he said: ``The people know that
did not happen. ... They also know we have a program to revitalize
the city.''
   Whelan, 41, a swimming instructor in a predominantly black
school, came out attacking early in the campaign. He challenged
Usry's record after a six-year tenure, and the was generally
considered a front-runner throughout the race.
   Among the other candidates, Councilman Seth Grossman had 1,546
votes, former City Council President Hank Tyner had 1,105 votes and
Assemblywoman Delores Cooper had 726 votes. Local activists Joseph
Polillo got 172 and John McQueen Jr. had 67.
   Usry first took office in 1984 after defeating then-Mayor
Michael Matthews in a recall election. Matthews later pleaded
guilty to extorting $10,000 from an undercover FBI agent.
   Usry defeated Ms. Cooper in 1986.

<HEAD>Brazil's Environment Chief Vows to Develop the Amazon `Humanely'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brazil's environment czar vowed Tuesday
to curb the destruction of the Amazon rain forest and to develop
the biologically sensitive area in a ``rational, humane and
ecological'' manner.
   ``We can't stop development and growth, but yes, we can make
human occupation compatible with the survival of the planet,'' said
National Environment Secretary Jose Lutzenberger.
   Lutzenberger, 64, outlined a plan for encouraging development
and farming while preserving the unique ecological balance of the
2-million square mile rain forest.
   A world-renown ecologist, he said the government will introduce
a program to revitalize the forest's soil through organic
agricultural methods and to reduce the traditional style of
slash-and-burn farming that has destroyed 200,000 square miles of
the region.
   He said the Collor de Mello administration, which first took
office in March, will also quadruple its fire-fighting efforts.
   ``In this way we will stop small farmers, impoverished by soil
that only gives two or three harvests, from burning other tracts of
the jungle,'' said Lutzenberger. He said the World Bank and the
Inter-American Development Bank had expressed interest in financing
the program but gave no details.
   Slash-and-burn farmers clear large tracts of unused land by
setting fires and then plant crops until the soil is exhausted.
They then move on to fresh land.
   Lutzenberger said the burnings are now monitored by satellites
that can detect even small brush fires. He said forest rangers in
helicopters are used to catch and fine violators.
   He said Brazil will also explore alternative energy sources such
as solar, wind and biomass energy instead of building the huge
hydroelectric dams that were popular in recent decades.
   Environmentalists have opposed the dams saying they flood huge
tracts of Amazon land, killing trees and animals while providing
few benefits for the thousands of Indians and Brazilian farmers
living in the area.
   He specifically singled out the Itaipu dam, built by Brazil and
Paraguay on the Parana River dividing the countries and the Tucurui
project in the Amazon jungle.
   ``Itaipu only produces at 60 percent of its capacity and we
don't even know what to do with so much energy,'' Lutzenberger
said. ``Tucurui generates electricity for large aluminum factories
that export minerals at low cost and the Amazon natives don't see
any benefit.''
   Lutzenberger said Brazil should scrap plans for large dams in
the rain forest and concentrate instead on promoting small
generators and floating river turbines financed and run by local
municipalities and private businessmen.
   The appointment of Lutzenberger, an agronomist educated in the
United States, was seen as a victory for conservationists, who
claim Brazil has traditionally done little to preserve the Amazon.
   ``There are many people who would like to see the jungle
disappear to raise cattle, but they won't do it with my approval,''
he said.

   The 1990 Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion,
one of the richest prizes in the world, was presented Tuesday by
Prince Philip to Indian lawyer Baba Amte and Australian biologist
Charles Birch.
   Amte, 75, a Hindu whose work for the sick crosses India's
religious divisions, and Birch, 72, a retired Sydney professor who
has explored links between science and religious faith, shared the
410,000 pounds ($684,000).
   Amte founded hospitals and centers for lepers, blind children,
the deaf and other handicapped of all India's religions. He also
founded centers for Untouchables, the lowest Hindu caste called
Harijans.
   Birch, a member of the Uniting Church of Australia composed of
Methodists, Presbyterians and Congregationalists, was at Buckingham
Palace for the brief private ceremony.
   He was accompanied by Sir John M. Templeton, the U.S.-born
investment counselor who founded and funds the annual prize. It was
first awarded in 1973 to Mother Teresa of Calcutta.
   The Templeton prize money is adjusted every year to keep it
ahead of the Nobel prize, worth 200,000 pounds ($334,000), said the
Rev. Wilbert Forker, Templeton's press spokesman.
   Amte was unable to travel and Philip handed the check to his
son, Dr. Vikas Amte, a leprologist.
   The son said Amte has not decided what he will do with the prize
but in the past has given about $100,000 in money from prizes ``to
causes for saving the environment.''
   Vikas Amte said his father was not religious, but he believed in
God and saw God in human beings.
   ``He has often said it isn't hard to establish a relationship
with God who is invisible and unknown but it's often very difficult
to establish a relationship with your neighbor,'' the son said.
   The prize citation for Birch called him an ``original thinker
(who) uses modern discoveries in natural science to expand man's
understanding of God as designer and creator of the universe and
its creatures.''
   Birch said he will use his prize partly to fund an annual
lecture at the University of Sydney on human aspects of science and
technology; will help a program on science and faith at the School
of Theology in Claremont, Calif., and a Christian social ethics
project in Geneva.
   Templeton, 77, a Presbyterian elder from Nashville, Tenn., is a
British citizen living in Nassau, Bahamas. He started the prize
because the Nobel prizes neglected religion.
   The Templeton Prize has been awarded to 16 Christians, two
Hindus, a Buddhist and a Moslem.
   Templeton told a news conference the prize was ``not for
saintliness nor good works ... but is limited to people who have
done something of an original nature that led to a great increase
in man's love of God or men's understanding of God.''

<HEAD>Judge Summons Witnesses in Salvadoran Massacre of Priests</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A judge said Tuesday he again
summoned two cadets who may have crucial knowledge involving the
massacre of six Jesuit priests to testify in the trial of nine
military men accused of the murders.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday the Bush
administration has told President Alfredo Cristiani the murder
investigation is ``a serious matter'' that could affect U.S.
attitudes on continued aid to El Salvador.
   Up to now, the only evidence against the accused is testimony by
other suspects in the case. Under Salvadoran law, such testimony is
not considered valid.
   A squad of uniformed soldiers roused the victims _ the six
priests as well as their housekeeper and her daughter _ from their
home at the Central American University campus on the night of Nov.
16. The eight were shot to death.
   The crimes were committed during a monthlong offensive by
leftist guerrillas, in a military-held area which was under a
dusk-to-dawn curfew.
   Col. Guillermo Benavides, commander of the Military School at
the time, and three lieutenants and five soldiers were charged with
the murders. Pretrial evidence purported to show the death squad
left from the school.
   Four cadets were on guard duty at the school that night and may
be able to shed light on who left and who entered the building then.
   But when Judge Ricardo Zamora of the 4th Criminal Court asked
them to appear as witnesses, the army told him they had been sent
out of the country on a study mission.
   Cadets Jose Wilfredo Aguilar Alvarado, Cesar Moises Rivera Perez
and Raul Galan Hernandez are at Fort Benning, Ga., and Erick
Othmaro Granados is at a military school in Panama.
   Zamora said Tuesday he again summoned Aguilar Alvarado and
Granados to testify.
   A court source told The Associated Press Monday that the
military reported as ``disappeared'' a guard logbook at the school
that the court wanted as evidence, and Benavides denied having a
personal diary he was supposed to have kept. The source insisted on
anonymity.
   Zamora said Tuesday that two officers summoned to testify have
not appeared, adding that it has become virtually impossible for
the case ``to be presented to the jury, because of lack of
evidence.''
   At least one retired officer said publicly that Benavides acted
under orders from higher ups to assassinate the Jesuits, whom the
pro-government press had been attacking as leftist sympathizers for
weeks before the murders.
   More than 72,000 people have been killed since guerrillas of the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN, launched a war
for power a decade ago. Most victims were civilians suspected of
being leftist sympathizers, slain by rightist death squads with
links to the military.
   The FMLN announced Tuesday it will continue attacking military
targets until an accord is reached with Cristiani's rightist
government to end the war.
   A rebel news release said the FMLN recently presented U.N.
official Alvaro de Soto, who is acting as a go-between with the
Cristiani government, an outline of their demands for ending the
war.
   In the document, rebel leaders reiterated earlier demands for
political reforms and that the size of the military be reduced and
its command structure purged of rightist officers.

<HEAD>Separatist Party Declares Victory After Preliminary Count</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ZAGREB, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of a separatist party
declared victory Tuesday after preliminary results showed his
Croatian Democratic Union had won at least 158 seats in the
356-seat state legislature.
   The final round of parliamentary elections, held Sunday and
Monday, was Croatia's first free vote in 50 years.
   With about 70 percent of the 2 million votes counted, the Party
for Democratic Reform, which ruled the republic as the Croatian
Communist Party before the elections, had 42 seats.
   A centrist coalition of independents and other smaller parties
won six seats, with distribution of the rest still uncertain.
   Democratic Union leader Franjo Tudjman said his party's first
task would be ``to prepare a new Western-style constitution for
Croatia and to discuss Yugoslavia's future'' with the other five
republics in the Yugoslav federation.
   Tudjman's center-right party advocates Croatia's independence
from the rest of Yugoslavia. Its apparent victory is likely to
exacerbate political and ethnic tensions with other republics,
particularly Serbia, which remains under orthodox Communist rule.
   The 66-year-old Tudjman, who was once the Yugoslav army's
youngest general, spent almost five years in jail in the 1970s for
Croatian nationalism and ``hostile activities'' against the state.
   He said he was once a ``true Communist believer, but now I'm
glad that Croatia is free of Marxist one-party hell.''
   Tudjman's campaign was based largely on nationalist sentiment
and the appeal for independence. Under his formula, Yugoslavia's
six republics would become independent states under a loose
confederation and would maintain relations only in areas of common
interest.
   Croatia followed the neighboring republic of Slovenia in holding
multiparty elections after more than four decades of one-party
rule. Macedonia and Bosnia-Hercegovina are planning free elections
later this year. Communist-ruled Montenegro and Serbia have not yet
legalized opposition parties.

   Pope John Paul II said Tuesday the
church and state in Mexico are reaching a better understanding and
issued a veiled appeal for a repeal of the decades-old
constitutional ban on Catholic schools.
   ``Open the world of teaching to Christ!'' the pope cried in a
speech to a crowd that included many schoolteachers.
   Later, before the biggest throng of the trip, John Paul called
on young Mexicans not to lose hope in the face of injustice and
poverty and to seize faith in Christ as a weapon against despair.
   Many of today's young are ``wounded by despair,'' the pope said,
citing ``evasion, abandon, hedonism, discotheques, drugs,
indifference, pessimism, the artificial paradises in which so many
find refuge.''
   Thousands of youths waved white, yellow and green handkerchiefs,
pennants and caps as the pope spoke to more than 200,000 people
gathered on the slopes of a bowl in the hills at San Juan de Los
Lagos, about 50 miles south of Aguascalientes.
   The pope's talks to the youth of Mexico and their teachers came
on the third day of his second trip to Mexico.
   On Tuesday night, back in Mexico City, the pope met with the
foreign diplomatic corps and urged a more moral approach to the
problems of refugees and the foreign debt.
   ``I feel the obligation to underline ... the ethical dimension
of this imprisoning crisis,'' the pontiff said, speaking about the
foreign debt.
   Mexico has a $93 billion foreign debt, second highest in the
developing world after Brazil.
   In Aguascalientes, 275 miles northwest of Mexico City, the pope
stopped off at the airport before flying on to San Juan. Because
the pope did not enter the city, replicas of downtown colonial
buildings were installed as a backdrop to his speech to teachers.
   John Paul, speaking under a white parasol to ward off the
blazing sun, noted recent increased contacts between the Vatican
and Mexico, whose constitution has harsh restrictions on religious
activity.
   ``A new perspective of contacts between the church and the
political community of this country is occurring in this day,'' the
pope said. ``And in this phase of better understanding and
dialogue, the church wants to offer its own support, without
straying from its specific goals and abilities.''
   It was the pope's most direct public comment on the gradual
relaxation of the church-state relationship in Mexico that was
symbolized when President Carlos Salinas de Gortari met John Paul
at the Mexico City airport on Sunday.
   The 1917 constitution says all schools must be government-run,
with a curriculum set by federal authorities.
   In practice, however, Catholic schools and universities have
long existed and are growing in number. In one of the paradoxes
that characterizes church-state relations, many government leaders
send their children to Catholic schools, which are generally
considered of higher quality.
   The pontiff said he hoped that Mexicans would overcome the idea
raised by critics that the church had obstructed cultural and
scientific progress.
   ``It is enough to remember the secular educative efforts of the
religious and ecclesiastical institutions, from the first
evangelization until the present day,'' he said.
   The church lost the right to religious schools because its
liberal opponents during the late 19th and early 20th centuries
believed it was a regressive force in Mexico that retarded social
progress.
   The pope drew wild cheers when he spontaneously saluted the
``corazones calientes,'' or ``hot hearts,'' of Aguascalientes,
which means hot waters and refers to the area's thermal springs.
   The throng did ``the wave'' and also waved white handkerchiefs
and flags bearing the image of the pope.
   John Paul then traveled to the nearby shrine of the Virgin of
San Juan de los Lagos. The 18th-century sanctuary, in a pink stone
basilica, contains an image of the Virgin made of corn husks.
Millions of pilgrims annually pay homage to the statue, which was
credited with resurrecting a dead little girl in 1623.
   I the afternoon Mass for youth, the pontiff's homily was
interrupted for minutes at a time by cheers and chants. When the
pope asked if those present would allow themselves to be tricked by
drugs, hedonism or false ideologies, they roared ``No.''
   ``Young people, don't lose hope, you are pilgrims of hope,'' the
pontiff said.
   John Paul called the Mass for youth ``the moment of my trip to
Mexico that I have most looked forward to.'' The pope has a special
affection for the young, and in Mexico, about 65 percent of the
population is under 29.
   John Paul appeared sunburned after a day in the sun even though
he spoke from the protection of a canopy. Priests on the temporary
altar at San Juan wore yellow baseball caps to shield themselves.
   John Paul's eight-day visit is his 47th trip outside Italy as
pope and his 10th journey to Latin America.

<HEAD>Ousted Homosexual Cadet Won't Have To Repay Tuition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy has reversed its ruling that an ROTC
cadet discharged for homosexuality will have to repay the
government $38,612 in scholarship tuition, the cadet learned
Tuesday.
   Rob Bettiker, a chemistry major at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, received a letter from the Navy saying the military
would drop its bid to force him to reimburse the government for the
tuition.
   Bettiker, who had been fighting the Navy over the issue, said he
thought the turnaround was ``great.''
   ``I was really surprised. I thought the best case that would
ever happen to me is that the secretary of the navy would just
consider my case indefinitely,'' he said.
   Bettiker said he hoped the Navy's decision would have
implications for other Reserve Officer Training Corps cadets
discharged for their sexual preference.
   ``The way it's worded, they tried to make it as particular to me
as possible _ but I feel its a precedent,'' he said.
   The Navy quit paying Bettiker's tuition after the fall semester.
Bettiker was discharged Jan. 31.
   The 22-year-old Ohio native had planned to enter the Navy's
prestigious Nuclear Propulsion Program after graduation next month
but will now be working in a cancer research laboratory at the
University of California at Berkeley.
   David Carney, a second homosexual cadet, has reportedly also
been exempted from the Navy's demand that ousted homosexual cadets
repay the government for tuition.
   Carney, a Harvard University graduate, is studying in Britain
and could not be contacted for comment.
   In an interview earlier, Carney said, ``In my view, the U.S.
Navy broke its contract with me, not vice versa.''
   A Navy spokesman said the two cases were ``reviewed on their
merits, and the decision was made not to seek recoupment,'' but
that there had been no changes in the Defense Department's policy
barring homosexuals from the armed forces, The New York Times
reported in Wednesday's editions.

   NATO is at a critical phase as it struggles to
adapt to change in Europe and tries to make ``a partner in
security'' out of the Soviet Union, the alliance's secretary
general says.
   ``We are looking at this alliance not as an instrument of
confrontation, but as an element of cooperation in a new security
structure,'' Manfred Woerner said Monday.
   Speaking on the eve of the opening of a new round of NATO
meetings, Woerner also dismissed Soviet suggestions that a unified
Germany become neutral or hold dual membership in both the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact.
   ``Neutrality is no alternative. And to be a member of both pacts
is just neutrality without a word,'' the former West German defense
minister said.

   Terry Anderson, the longest held of the 16
Western hostages, helped fellow prisoners make Scrabble and
Monopoly games to amuse themselves, according to a newly freed
captive.
   His guards are giving him and other hostages plenty of
diversions, according to an account given by former hostage Frank
Reed to Anderson's sister, Peggy Say.
   ``They have a lot of things which was encouraging to me; at
least they did at the time Frank was there,'' Mrs. Say said Monday.
These included boxes of books, writing materials and dominoes.
   Although Anderson, 42, is in good physical condition from plenty
of exercise, he is tired and needs dental care, Mrs. Say said. She
said the hostages are blindfolded and chained in line with their
preference.

   If he quits his job, Rep. Stephen Solarz could
become an instant millionaire. So could Rep. Dan Rostenkowski.
   Democrats Solarz and Rostenkowski are the two could-be
millionaires among 184 House ``grandfathers'' who can put their
campaign cash to personal use if they retire from the House by
January 1993.
   Put more simply, they can take the money and not run.
   Congress last year voted to close the loophole that allows
certain House members to take their campaign funds with them when
they retire, but the new restrictions did not take effect

   The charred remnants of America's
two worst space tragedies, the 1967 Apollo fire and the 1986
Challenger explosion, will soon be united in an abandoned missile
silo miles from any plaque or memorial.
   The Apollo capsule will be moved from NASA's Langley Research
Center in Hampton, Va., where it has been in a shipping container
for 23 years, and buried atop the remains of the shuttle.
   No ceremony is scheduled when the capsule, its heat shield and
31 cartons of hardware and investigative material arrive on a
flatbed truck around May 20. No marker is planned.
   ``It's not as if by putting this in the silo we have forgotten
the contribution these guys have made to the program. There are
memorials'' elsewhere, said NASA spokesman Mark Hess. ``We didn't
think it was really appropriate that we do anything special or make
some kind of a public event out of this.''

<HEAD>Bush Meets With Congressional Republicans on Budget Summit
Proposal</HEAD>

   President Bush met with Republican leaders
today to push his idea for a ``no preconditions'' budget summit
designed to reduce the deficit.
   Democrats were holding separate meetings to map strategy for
their participation in what could be the first formal tax-increase
discussions of Bush's presidency.
   GOP leaders have hailed Bush's ice-breaking overtures on the
budget.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said on Monday he
believed Democrats would join in the process.
   ``I believe the answer will be in the affirmative,'' said Dole.
``We need to do it.''
   Democratic leaders of the House and Senate, meantime, were
meeting with rank-and-file members to gauge their feelings about
budget bargaining in an election year.
   Sixteen top Democrats met for an hour Monday in a closed-door
session.
   ``We've had different views expressed,'' House Speaker Thomas S.
Foley, D-Wash., said afterward.
   Pressure has been building for action on the budget because of
the slowing economy and the increasing cost projections of the
federal bailout of the savings and loan industry.
   The weaker the economy, the less revenue the government can
expect to collect and the greater the federal deficit.
   As a result, the amount of budget cuts the administration says
will be er taxes and cuts in benefit programs.
   ``You sure aren't going to get that without starting this
process and having the right people there arguing all of it on the
table,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, ranking Republican
on the Senate Budget Committee.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said there would be ``no
preconditions'' to holding the negotiations. Republicans denied
that such a statement is inconsistent with Bush's campaign pledge
of ``no new taxes.''
   ``There isn't any president who hasn't tried to make good on his
promises. There's no president who hasn't lived through times that
change, and maybe outdate some promises,'' said Rep. Bill Frenzel
of Minnesota, top Republican on the House Budget Committee.
   Frenzel said he favors a package paring next year's deficit by
$55 billion, including some form of new taxes would be ``the only
way (Bush) can do the job,'' Frenzel said.
   Domenici said he would want to reduce the shortfall by between
$42 billion and $50 billion. Higher taxes should be open to
negotiations, he said.
   Last week, the House passed a Democratic-written spending plan
that includes $36 billion in deficit reduction. The Senate Budget
Committee approved another Democratic plan containing $43 billion
in savings. Both proposals would give the military nearly $10
billion less next year than Bush wants.
   Bush proposed a budget in January that claims to shrink the
shortfall by $36 billion to just under $64 billion. The
Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law requires that next year's budget
gap not exceed $64 billion.

<HEAD>Out There Is an Economic Boom</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Somewhere out there is an economic boom _ in the
Pacific Rim, in Eastern Europe, in Western Europe's unified market
of 1992, in Latin America, even in the United States.
   You can feel it and read about it in daily newspaper reports, in
the economic analyses of brokerage houses, in academic writings.
The world's politics and markets are being restructured.
Opportunity is out there.
   Seizing it, however, may be another matter, akin to reaching for
a rainbow or grasping for a dream or walking into a mirage. Or, as
it has been put, like trying to spend the so-called peace dividend.
   A decade or more ago the boom was to be in Latin America, with
U.S. banks financing the way toward swift industrial development.
Somehow it didn't work out that way; now, some of those nations
can't afford to repay the loans.
   The Pacific Rim was the rage a few years ago. Economies on the
Asian shore of the Pacific Ocean were exporting huge amounts of
products and rapidly raising their living standards. Moreover,
there was China, an awakening giant.
   But the United States got tired of importing so much and began
insisting on freer trade. China lost a great deal of enthusiasm for
Western-style development. The future of Hong Kong once more was
thrown into question.
   The European Economic Community's barrier-free market, scheduled
for 1992, became an outlet for the emotions of economic boomers.
The United States of Europe, that's what it would be.
   What a market, declared the boomers. Europe will produce more
efficiently what they make best, and the United States will do what
it does best, and the two massive entities will trade themselves
into greater wealth.
   It might come true, but experience flashes caution. It could
mean more competition than cooperation. Trade relations always are
touchy; each side feels it gives too much, neither side believes it
receives reciprocity.
   Thank goodness for the East European option, said American
business people. The sudden development of free markets in the
socialist states will provide an enormous opportunity for
industrial and consumer goods, they said.
   Questions: Will people accustomed to governmental paternalism
adjust to the uncertainies, the risks of competition? Who will pay
the bills for cleaning up the polluted environment? What goods can
these nations offer in trade?
   Where will the boom occur? How? Perhaps, some say, right here in
the United States, with the peace dividend being the lever. That
thought had currency for awhile, but the thesis slammed into
reality.
   It probably is true that money will be saved on military
defense, but everyone knows that dozens of new ways to spend
already are waiting for sponsorship, and that every one of them
will be deemed urgent by somebody.
   To date, the peace dividend has been layoffs, not just from cuts
in government spending but from efforts by companies to lessen
their dependency on government contracts. Why, taxes might even be
raised, not lowered.
   The lack of success in finding an economic boom, or the
potential for one, is not discouraging the seekers. Brokerage
houses aren't just looking one year ahead, difficult as that is to
do, but an entire decade _ into a new century.
   The forecasts are laden with terminology such as new era, decade
of globalization, era of change, new world, gay nineties (all over
again), the century of space. Most have a world view, or even a
spatial perspective.
   But when the future becomes history, it might be seen all over
again that the greatest boom of all was created right in the homes,
in the insatiable appetite of human beings for new consumer
products, services and dreams.

<HEAD>Panama Military Questioned for Retaining Pro-Noriega Elements</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People don't fear the military as
they did when Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega was in power, but
deciding on its role and personnel is a problem for the new
government.
   The new Public Forces include officers who were loyal to
Noriega. Many Panamanians question whether high-ranking officials
of the old regime have a place in the new order.
   ``Panamanians won't accept that officers of the old Defense
Forces could be those who, in a democracy, control the police,''
the newspaper Panama-America said. ``To think about putting into
uniform and arming those who for many years oppressed, punished and
tortured is not an easy task.''
   The military's makeup should be submitted to a referendum, said
Alberto Conte, leader of the Civic Crusade, a business and
professional organizaion that led the opposition to Noriega.
   Keeping Noriega's old officers ``doesn't offer any guarantee
that the new Public Forces will be efficient, respectful and
demilitarized,'' he said.
   Eusebio Marchosky, in charge of an effort to recover state
property stolen by Noriega and his cronies, said officers who had
served the dictator were hindering his work and retaining them ``is
against the national will.''
   Ricardo Arias Calderon, who is second vice president, interior
minister and justice minister, has said Panama's leaders chose to
keep Noriega's officers after the U.S. invasion in December because
``to exclude them would be to judge them categorically, and not as
individuals.''
   Officials of the civilian government have accused members of the
new Public Forces of crimes.
   Special prosecutor Rodrigo Miranda charged Capt. Leslie Loaiza,
head of the Judicial Police Academy, with involvement in the
kidnap-killing of Marcos Rodriguez Justines, 3-year-old nephew of
former Col. Marcos Justines, who was Noriega's second in command
and now is in jail.
   Officials say the apparent reason for the abduction was to force
Justines, jailed on charges of helping steal $47 million in a bank
scandal, to share the money. Why the child was killed is uncertain.
   Forty-seven other other Noriega officers are jailed on charges
ranging from misdemeanors to murder.
   Noriega took refuge in the Vatican Embassy, but surrendered to
U.S. forces Jan. 3 and now awaits trial on drug charges in Miami.
   Arias said many Panamanians had suggested ``firing everyone and
recruiting from zero.'' On the second day of the invasion, he said,
the leadership had to decide between that and issuing ``a call to
service on new terms.''
   Forming an entirely new military and police force would have
meant asking U.S. soldiers to remain three to five years while it
was done, Arias said.
   Mario Rognoni, a legislator from Noriega's Democratic
Revolutionary Party, said: ``the idea of demilitarizing the country
is an error because a modern state must have the necessary elements
of security.''
   He said Panama is made vulnerable by its location and the fact
that it will assume control of the Panama Canal at the end of the
century.
   For more than two decades, the Panama Defense Forces were
responsible for all military and police functions, which now are
under civilian control
   This year's military budget is $80 million, about $70 million
less than under Noriega and only 3.5 percent of the total national
budget.
   Several specialized battalions Noriega controlled have been
disbanded, along with six schools or bases generally used for
military instruction. A civilian police academy is in the planning
stages.
   Panama's air force is run by the National Air Service and 12 of
its more costly planes are assigned to the Treasury Ministry. The
navy and marines no longer exist.
   ``There will be nobody in uniform in charge of all services,'' a
role reserved for the civilian president, Arias said.
   He said a commission concluded the ratio of security forces to
citizens should be 4 to 1,000, meaning 8,000 officers, but that
Panama needed 12,000 because of its forests and special maritime
needs. The commission was made up of security officials from Spain,
Argentina and Costa Rica, which disbanded its army more than 40
years ago.
   Noriega's Defense Forces numbered about 15,000.

<HEAD>ROMANCING THE SOUNDS: The Record Industry</HEAD>
<HEAD>Columbia Records' Chief Has an Ear Open for Alternative Music</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICIA BIBBY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The youngest president of the one of the world's
largest record companies has an itchy ear for alternative music and
is pushing those bands harder than such superstar staples as
Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen.
   Don Ienner, 36, became president of Columbia Records a year ago,
after being lured from Arista Records, where he was executive vice
president and general manager. While at Arista, he helped launch
singer Whitney Houston into pop-stardom.
   But within just 48 hours at Columbia, Ienner seized upon the
sound of Poi Dog Pondering, an eclectic folk-ethnic-rock band from
Hawaii and Texas who had two EPs out on the tiny label of Texas
Hotel Records.
   The idea, Ienner said in an interview, was to get alternative
bands and work with them over the years to create a mainstream
following.
   ``We had Bruce Springsteen covered,'' Ienner said. ``The
previous regime had no idea what we were doing with alternative
music. They didn't break the Psychedelic Furs, they didn't break so
many great bands. ... Nothing, nobody. The philosophy before was,
if you can't sell 2 million albums don't work it.''
   CBS Records, which owns Columbia Records, in the past rode high
with mainstream successes such as Jackson's ``Thriller,'' and
mega-hits from Springsteen, George Michael, Barbra Streisand, Billy
Joel, Neil Diamond and James Taylor.
   But Columbia Records was in a slump after Sony Corp. bought the
parent company in 1988.
   ``We needed to change direction,'' Ienner said. ``There was
nothing, just retreading the superstars, just one after another
after another. That's why we were losing market share; that's why
we were losing people; that's why we weren't getting any new
bands.''
   Ienner speaks in a booming staccato about his professional
passion: music.
   ``I'm not a Harvard MBA,'' he said. ``I'm not the accountant and
I never even finished high school. Music has been my life and
that's the thing I love the most.''
   He started his career as a teen-ager working in the Capitol
Records mailroom in 1969. From 1972-77, he was in partnership with
his brother, Jimmy Ienner, in a publishing, management and
production company. He went to Arista from Millennium Records, a
label he co-founded in 1977.
   Besides Poi Dog Pondering, the first band he signed as president
after a heated battle with almost every other major record label,
he picked a young band called Toad the Wet Sprocket from Santa
Barbara, Calif.
   Poi Dog has befuddled music critics trying to describe its
peculiar sound. The ensemble plays everything from the standard
guitar, bass, drums to the not-so-standard accordian, flugelhorn,
tin whistle, wood block, congas, banjo and somebody's used frying
pan.
   Among other things, the ensuing musical mesh has been called
``hillbilly-luau-Earth Mother rock,'' a ``wild stew of global folk
styles'' and a ``blissful aural buzz.''
   Toad the Wet Sprocket relies heavily on an accoustic guitar, has
a sound in the vein of the Smiths and fuzzy, resonant vocals
similar to R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe.
   ``It was important that we get and use Poi Dog Pondering as our
signature band,'' Ienner said. Poi Dog and Toad would ``show our
musical sensitivity.''
   It would also help Columbia cater to a huge audience carved out
in large part by college radio stations looking for an alternative
to Top 40 music.
   The hope is also that the smaller, dormant bands will blossom
into big hits further down the line, similar to the success of
bands and artists such as R.E.M., the Replacements, the B-52s, the
Violent Femmes, New Order, Lou Reed and Elvis Costello, all on the
Warner Bros. label.
   ``If you work the baby bands as hard as you work the big bands
or maybe work the baby bands more than you work the big bands ...
you'll have something that you'll be proud of in the next five
years,'' said Ienner.

<DATELINE>YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It wasn't long after the
first tourists appeared in the valley carved amid granite peaks
that conservationists mourned the impact of humans here.
   Frederick Law Olmsted, a member of the first Yosemite
Commission, wrote in 1865 of ``picturesque rocks stenciled over
with advertisements of patent medicines.'' Naturalist John Muir
complained the ``valley looked like a frowsy, backwoods pasture''
after a visit in 1889, the year before Yosemite became a national
park.
   Yosemite National Park turns 100 this year. So do its problems.
   In Muir's day, no more than a couple of thousand hardy folk each
year trekked through the wilderness to refresh themselves in the
mists of Yosemite Falls and marvel at the park's granite monolith,
El Capitan.
   Last year, 3.4 million people came through the valley, bringing
with them some of the very problems they were trying to escape in
the city. Park officials are struggling with the best way to deal
with the crowding, pollution, development and traffic that threaten
its natural beauty and serenity.
   ``Yosemite, for a number of reasons, really just ranks very
highly in people's level of care,'' said Allan Bedwell, National
Park Service spokesman. ``It goes back to Yosemite playing a major
role in this country as a symbol of wilderness or nature or
primeval heritage.
   ``I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that it's
accessible to people. Those cliffs, those waterfalls, represent
wilderness _ even though you have to view that wilderness in a
fairly urban setting.''
   Visitors can order anything from pizza to prime rib in
Yosemite's snack bars and restaurants, or buy T-shirts, tennis
balls and mugs in park gift shops, then get extra cash from an
automatic teller machine. A beauty shop and video rental cater to
park service and concession employees who live in the valley.
   Law enforcement officers booked 500 people into the jail last
year.
   It was anticipated a decade ago that Yosemite's 100th birthday
on Oct. 1, 1990, also would be a celebration of the ambitious 1980
general management plan that promised to balance convenience with
conservation.
   But 10 years proved too short a time to meet such grandiose
goals as eliminating cars from the valley and removing nonessential
businesses, offices and personnel to locations outside the park
boundaries.
   The park service has acknowledged the failure to fully implement
the plan and is cataloging nearly 4,500 letters of comment from
park enthusiasts as it decides how to plan realistically for
Yosemite's next 100 years.
   ``The plan was formulated at a time when there was a different
administration and different political climate,'' Park
Superintendent Michael Finley said.
   Its implementation was hindered, in part, by a lack of money
and, in some instances, by proposals that proved unrealistic,
Finley said.
   For example, a landscape architect has found there is not enough
suitable land to expand employee housing in the community of El
Portal outside the park, as the plan proposes, Finley said.
   The park service did succeed in eliminating 650 parking spaces
as planned, but a parking garage that was supposed to replace some
of the lost spaces never materialized.
   Pressure to remove facilities from the park has remained
constant from environmentalists, who complain many of the services
interfere with the mandate to preserve Yosemite.
   ``We want to make it accessible to people. But do you need to be
able to buy mugs and T-shirts and a badminton racquet in order to
enjoy Yosemite National Park?'' asked Patricia Schifferle, regional
director of the Wilderness Society.
   Superintendent Finley argues that visitors who soothe their
muscles in a swimming pool after hiking to the top of Yosemite
Falls or spend a night in a $180 room at the Ahwahnee Hotel also
gain an appreciation of the park.
   ``If you look at it one way, you could be shocked and say, `In
John Muir's holy temple there are swimming pools,''' Finley said.
``But if John Muir could keep 200,000 people from churning up the
Merced River, would he do it by putting in three swimming pools?''
   At the heart of the controversy over what services are
appropriate for a national park is the Yosemite Park and Curry Co.,
a subsidiary of MCA, which provides guest services in the park.
   Critics argue that Curry wields too much influence over the
park. Schifferle cites Curry's proposal to remove some existing
employee housing and replace it with dormitories near Yosemite
Lodge. Schifferle says the plan is contrary to the goal of removing
unnecessary employee housing from the valley.
   ``A lot of what's been said critical of the Curry Company is
flat erroneous. They've said we want to build more facilities here.
Not true,'' said Curry spokesman John Poimiroo. He defended the
dormitory plan, saying it would decrease traffic between El Portal,
where it was proposed employees would be moved, and the valley
floor.
   Critics also say the company profits from a 30-year contract
that requires it to pay the government only .75 percent of its
annual sales while not contributing to the goals of the general
management plan.
   The National Park Service revealed that in 1989 Curry paid
$635,000 to provide, without competition, most guest services.
   Poimiroo admits the fee is low. He points out, however, that
Curry's financial commitment to the park does not end with the
concessions fee.
   Curry also has invested $100 million in the park since 1973,
when MCA bought the concessionaire, in maintenance and capital
improvements, which included $8 million to repair and restore the
Ahwahnee Hotel, Poimiroo said.
   But claims that the money represents an investment in the park
are met with skepticism by environmentalists, who say Curry
ultimately makes money on that type of spending.
   ``Are they spending money on the park, or are they spending
money to do business in the park?'' Schifferle said. ``That's why I
find the $100 million is probably more PR hype than reality as far
as actual benefit to the park. It's probably benefiting Curry
Company enormously.''
   Attempts to renegotiate the concessions fee before the contract
expires in 1993 have failed, but many expect the new contract to
include clauses requiring Curry to invest some profits in specific
programs.
   Finley points out that even successfully raising the fee would
not necessarily mean more money for Yosemite itself. The
concessions fee is deposited in the U.S. Treasury where it is
re-appropriated by Congress, leaving the park service to compete
with other interests, Finley said.
   The lively debate on how to protect Yosemite's natural beauty
inevitably leads to the park service's conflicting missions:
preserving the park while making it accessible to the public.
   ``Yosemite always has been on the political hot seat because,
probably more than any other park, it mirrors that tension every
day of every year,'' said Jim Snyder, park historian. ``The issues
have become national because they symbolize what could happen to
the national parks.''

<HEAD>The Dump Quayle Rumor: No One Believes It But Still It Lives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The odd thing about the Dan Quayle rumor is
how few people believe it. Yet it refuses to die.
   Three years in advance of Election Day 1992, President Bush told
The Dallas Morning News that Quayle ``absolutely'' would be his
running mate again. ``He's doing a very good job, an outstanding
job,'' said the president.
   Then why is Washington awash in a new flurry of ``dump Quayle''
rumors?
   The poll numbers certainly have a lot to do with it. Bush enjoys
approval ratings of close to 80 percent, while fewer than half the
people questioned give Quayle passing grades. In a recent Gallup
poll, 54 percent described Quayle as unqualified to be president.
   It all has to do with the news business, said Walter F. Mondale,
who spent four years as vice president without anyone suggesting he
was about to be dumped by Jimmy Carter.
   ``On every national political news reporter's calendar, oh,
about October of the first term of a president, he always writes
the vice presidential failure story,'' said Mondale.
   ``The reason I never had one is we would usually get a hint the
story was coming and Carter would call the reporter personally.
He'd say `I want you to know Mondale is the best vice president
anybody ever had and I'm very happy with him.'''
   But Mondale was the exception.
   Conservatives wanted to dump George Bush. Liberals wanted to
dump Lyndon Johnson. Moderates wanted to dump Richard Nixon.
Conservatives wanted to dump Nelson Rockefeller. In restrospect, it
seems like lots of people wanted to dump Spiro Agnew.
   It's part of the job description for vice presidents:
   Preside over the Senate, attend funerals, and be the target of
rumors the president wishes he'd picked someone else for his
running mate.
   But switches are rare.
   Gerald Ford dumped Rockefeller in 1976 in favor of Sen. Bob Dole
of Kansas, who campaigned at a low growl and shocked viewers of his
debate with Mondale when he blamed Democrats for all the wars of
the 20th Century.
   Dole has quipped that in the 1976 campaign he went for the
jugular and got his own.
   Richard Viguerie, a conservative activist, recalled the ``save
Agnew'' effort mounted by the political right in 1971 when there
was talk that Nixon might dump the former Maryland governor from
the ticket in 1972.
   ``Conservatives made a big effort to make sure Agnew stayed on
the ticket,'' he said. They needn't have bothered. Soulmate Pat
Buchanan later said that Nixon had ``no thoughts or intentions of
dumping Agnew.''
   Viguerie and his ideological comrades would have liked someone
other than Bush as Ronald Reagan's running mate in 1984.
   But, said Viguerie, ``Conservatives never thought there was any
hope of dumping Bush.''
   One near-unanimous view in assessing the Quayle rumor is that
Bush has a highly developed sense of loyalty and would not dump the
man he picked to run with him in 1988.
   ``If anybody really knows George Bush they know he is long on
loyalty,'' said Tom Griscom, who served as White House
communications director during the Reagan presidency.
   ``George Bush is about as intensely loyal a person as you'll
ever find in politics,'' said Viguerie.
   And yet, the rumor continues to have currency.
   A recent version noted that Secretary of State James A. Baker
III had bought a ranch in Wyoming _ and that's a fact. Baker's real
estate deal prompted speculation that he would change his voting
residence to Wyoming so that he could run in 1992 on a ticket
headed by fellow Texan George Bush.
   The Constitution bars presidential electors from casting their
votes for two candidates from their own state. Thus if two Texans
were paired on the national ticket, only one of them could receive
that state's electoral votes.
   ``Absolutely, positively, he has no plan to change his voting
residence,'' said Margaret Tutwiler, a longtime Baker aide who now
is chief State Department spokesman.
   Washington loves a good rumor and even many of those who
shrugged off the Quayle speculation did so in a way that somehow
kept it alive.
   ``The problem with this is the timing is all wrong,'' said a
political consultant who insisted on anonymity. As quickly as he
dismissed a Baker-for-Quayle trade as improbable, the consultant
went on to speculate that Quayle's standing in the polls ``will
never improve. In this age of mass media, once the public has
decided something there's just no way to reverse it.''
   Another consultant pointed to a magazine article about columnist
George Will, who happens to be one of Bush's least favorite people.
Take note, said the consultant, who insisted on being nameless,
that the article was written by Bush friend Vic Gold. Further, said
he, it points out that Will and Quayle have been lunching together
_ a sure sign to the devious of mind that the president is peeved
with his veep.
   Mondale offered a little sympathy.
   ``You can always find someone in any administration who thinks
the vice president should go and usually you can find quite a
chorus if you put in an hour or two,'' said the former vice
president.
   But Mondale also said that Quayle's problem appears ``different
in depth and scope.'' Quayle, he said, ``is a troubled occupant of
that position.''

   The Labor Department issued a report Friday that
created quite a shock. Hardly anybody concerned with the future of
the economy failed to react to it within minutes.
   Many economists were unnerved. After reading the report, they
wondered what had gone wrong with their interpretation of the data,
and why they had not foreseen what occurred.
   Some viewed the new report as indicative of an economy even
weaker than realized. Some saw it as a sign the bottom had been
reached, and that the economy would begin strengthening. The stock
market suddenly came alive.
   Whatever they made of the numbers, hardly an economist who wants
to remain in the public eye failed to offer an explanation,
interpretation or forecast.
   Most significant of all the reactions was the widespread view _
it seemed to sweep through the investment community in minutes _
that the numbers would force the Federal Reserve to reconsider
lifting interest rates.
   What caused this commotion?
   The April jobless rate and numbers that created it, that's what.
What did the rate do? It rose to 5.4 percent in April from 5.2
percent in March. Or, if you include military, to 5.3 percent from
5.1 percent.
   You might wonder how little numbers like that can cause big
reactions like those that occurred, and your wonderment is
justified. After a weekend of reflection, you may be sure that many
people are less excited than before.
   That short period of reflection, for example, might have caused
some of them to realize that the change in the numbers might be a
matter of methodology rather than reality. And that the numbers
might yet be revised.
   Revisions are common, and they include the March numbers. After
studying their data, for example, Labor Department analysts raised
by 103,000 their estimate of payroll increases in that month. The
earlier figure was 26,000.
   A single month's data has always been suspect, simply because it
could be an isolated event. That event could be a real one, an
actual occurrence, but it also could be due to faulty counting or
to seasonal adjusting.
   While realizing this, the economic fraternity nevertheless
reacted as if to a major event, and one conceivable explanation
might be boredom. A look at the statistics over the past year or so
provides the basis for that theory.
   Since last April, that is, the most inclusive monthly
unemployment rate, one that includes military, has varied from 5.3
percent only once. That was last May, when it dipped to 5.2 percent
of the labor force.
   In short, the jobless rate has provided little if any clue to
the economy's direction in that time, a time in which the economic
fraternity was looking far, wide and everywhere for any little
indication of direction.
   Placed in that perspective, therefore, the April jobless rate
represented a big change. And, to be sure, some other elements in
the report were significant, such as a continued decline of
manufacturing employment.
   But even Janet Norwood, commissioner of labor statistics,
thought the report wasn't really of major significance, and she so
informed Congress. She told them that:
   ``... Thus far we can discern no meaningful changes in the
measures that might signal a deteriorating unemployment situation.''
   In particular, Mrs. Norwood said, ``neither the number of newly
unemployed _ those jobless less than than five weeks _ nor the
number of job losers has started to climb.''

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities fell at the latest auction to their lowest level in
several weeks.
   The Treasury Department on Monday sold $8.4 billion in
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.79 percent, down
from 7.91 percent last week. Another $8.4 billion was sold in
six-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.84 percent, down
from 8.03 percent last week.
   The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 7.78
percent on April 23, and six-month bills averaged 7.75 percent on
April 16.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 8.06 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,803.10 and 8.29 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,603.60.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 8.56
percent last week, down from 8.57 percent the previous week.

<HEAD>Analysts Say Cash, Not Service, Important Question For Greyhound</HEAD>

   Greyhound Lines Inc. has resumed most of its
operations, but some analysts question whether the company has
enough cash to avoid bankruptcy as it tries to recover from a
9-week walkout by bus drivers.
   Chairman Fred G. Currey said Monday the strike was ``in effect
concluded from the point of view of day-to-day operations.'' He
said Greyhound is serving areas which brought in 98 percent of its
revenue last year, and will be running at 90 percent of scheduled
pre-strike miles by June 19.
   Union officials challenged the claim, pointing to the company's
recent announcement of a $55.8 million first-quarter loss. They
said Curry was trying to scare striking drivers back to work.
   In addition to the loss, Greyhound has said it would not make a
$9.75 million interest payment due May 15. The company also did not
pay about $5 million in lease payments due at the end of April.
   Some analysts have questioned whether the Dallas-based company
will be able to pay bills to operate even if creditors don't call
in their loans and force the company into bankruptcy _ a
possibility because of the missed payments.
   Greyhound had amassed a strike fund of more than $50 million but
has said the frequently violent walkout, in which some buses have
been hit by gunfire, has cost more than anticipated.
   In documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
last week, Greyhound said it had spent $20 million on beefed up
security, legal fees and extra driver training.
   ``I'm surprised at how much cash they're burning,'' said Leigh
Walzer, an analyst with R.D. Smith &amp; Co. in New York. ``Cash could
become a real bind.'' Walzer gave the company only a 20 percent
chance of surviving the strike without having to file for Chapter
11 bankruptcy protection from creditors.
   Currey would not disclose Greyhound's cash resources in an
interview Monday, but he said money that would have been used to
cover interest and lease costs is being used to help operate the
company.
   Nevertheless, Currey said creditors recognize Greyhound can be
rebuilt and ``we expect and we've received cooperation.''
   Currey said ridership increased last week to its highest levels
since the strike began, although it remains between 65 percent and
75 percent of year-ago levels.
   Revenue is running at about the same level, he said, and remains
less than expenses, although the carrier is near break-even.
   He suggested revenues would be 85 percent to 90 percent of last
year's levels by mid- to late summer. Curry also said the company
could post a profit by next year.
   Union officials have challenged the company's claims of restored
service and said Currey's victory cry was a publicity stunt.
   ``It's a common ploy to try to scare a few more strikers into
scabbing by announcing that there's no hope,'' said AFL-CIO
spokesman Rex Hardesty.
   ``Mr. Currey's claim that the Greyhound strike is over is like
Napoleon claiming victory at Waterloo _ its' both ridiculous and
false,'' said Jim La Sala, international president of the
Amalgamated Transit Union, the umbrella organization for the
Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions.
   The company proposed a contract offer Saturday that would have
eliminated 4,500 union jobs, changed from per-mile wage rates to
hourly wage rates and imposed a four-year wage freeze. Union
officials called the proposal an ``insult'' and refused to put it
to a vote. No further talks were scheduled.
   Currey did not rule out resuming negotiations with the union,
noting it remains the licensed bargaining agent for the drivers. He
said the company would continue to need drivers as it expands.
   The union, which represents 6,300 drivers and about 3,000 office
and maintenance workers, walked off the job March 2.
   As of Monday, the company said 548 union drivers had crossed
picket lines. It also had hired 2,888 new drivers and had 501
others in school, which would give it 3,937 available drivers by
May 16.
   Greyhound has said before it could operate a full system with
about 3,200 drivers, although more are needed for the busy summer
travel season.
   The company also said it would reduce its charter operation
sharply _ from 197 cities to 19 cities _ and cut unprofitable miles.
   Company officials could not provide the number of destinations
that will lose service, but Currey said, ``Local carriers already
have moved on to many of those routes, and Greyhound is trying to
locate new carriers for the others.''
   ``It would appear that the company needed this strike to justify
abandoning bus service to rural communities across the country,''
said the ATU's La Sala.

   MCI Communications Corp. Chairman William G.
McGowan has a surprise for shareholders of the phone company's
common stock: the first-ever dividend.
   MCI, the nation's second-largest long-distance company, will pay
a twice-a-year dividend of 5 cents, McGowan told applauding
shareholders at the company's 18th annual meeting Monday.
   He said the dividend would be payable June 11 to shareholders of
record as of May 21.
   ``That is going to be an MCI policy,'' said McGowan, adding,
``Hopefully, we'll even increase it someday.''
   ``We didn't want to borrow to pay a dividend and we didn't go
cash-positive until the third quarter of 1988,'' said Daniel F.
Akerson, MCI's chief financial officer.
   He said that for nearly two years, MCI paid its bills as well as
financed expansion through internally generated funds.
   That practice was broken last month when MCI said it would
borrow money from banks to buy Telecom USA Inc. of Atlanta, the No.
4 long-distance company, for $1.25 billion.
   ``We didn't want to send the wrong message'' to investors,
Akerson said, adding, ``that's why it's a modest dividend. We still
feel investors that invest in MCI are primarilly interested in
growth.''
   Still, he said the company decided to start paying a dividend in
part to attract institutional investors such as pension funds, many
of which are barred by their own rules from investing in companies
that do not pay dividends.
   McGowan, who ran the 90-minute meeting at the Kennedy Center's
concert hall, appeared in good spirits despite having undergone
chest surgery in April. McGowan, who underwent a heart transplant
in 1987, was released April 16 from a Pittsburgh hospital. The most
recent surgery was described as unrelated to the transplant.
   McGowan said the board of directors approved the dividend
despite having second thoughts about committing the
Washington-based company to the expense while acquiring Telecom
USA. The acquisition, announced April 9, awaits approval by
Telecom's shareholders and several government agenies.
   MCI earned $156 million in the first quarter on revenue of $1.8
billion. For all of 1989, the company's profit rose 58 percent to
$529 million on revenue of $6.47 billion.
   MCI stock was the third-most-active issue Monday in the national
over-the-counter market, gaining 37{ cents to $38.25.

   The jurisdictional turf battle between the
federal agencies regulating securities and futures markets moves to
the Senate panel that oversees one of the rivals, the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission.
   The CFTC has been locked in a war of words with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, the stock market regulator, over which
should oversee financial products that have elements of both a
security and a futures contract. So-called hybrid products include
stock index futures.
   The Senate Agriculture Committee was scheduled to hear this
afternoon from top officials of the four agencies that make up the
White House Working Group on Financial Markets _ the Federal
Reserve Board, the SEC, CFTC and the Treasury Department. The group
was set up in the wake of the 1987 stock market crash to handle
intermarket issues.
   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, SEC Chairman Richard Breeden, CFTC
Chairman Wendy Gramm and Treasury Undersecretary Robert Glauber
were scheduled to appear at the hearing.
   The four already have aired their views before congressional
panels and in numerous speeches and interviews. Breeden and Glauber
are on one side. Gramm on the other with Greenspan somewhere in
between.
   Breeden and Glauber think, at the very least, the SEC should be
given control of stock index futures. These products _ now
controlled by the futures exchanges with CFTC oversight _ allow
investors to speculate on the stock market without buying the
underlying stocks.
   A federal appeals court last year ruled that such hybrid
products come under the purview of the CFTC if they have the
slightest similarity to a futures contract.
   Breeden has complained that the court ruling discourages
financial innovation and drives new products to foreign markets.
   Greenspan says he is ``slightly in favor'' of giving the SEC
control of stock index futures.
   But he is against merging the SEC and CFTC, which has been
proposed in legislation introduced in the House last month.
   Greenspan also says one agency should be responsible for setting
margin limits _ but he doesn't know which one. Margins are the down
payments investors must make to buy securities or futures contracts
on credit.
   Margins for the securities markets, usually 50 percent of the
total price, are set by the Fed. Margins for futures contracts are
set by the exchanges with limited input by the CFTC, and typically
are much lower.
   Critics claim that the disparity in margins limits leads to a
trading strategy known as index arbitrage in which speculators,
trying to take advantage of brief price differences between the two
markets, move huge blocks of stock back and forth.
   That, say critics, leads to wild price swings that frightens
small investors from the stock market.
   But Gramm disagrees with those criticisms. In a speech to a
futures industry conference last week, she said the attempt to grab
CFTC authority over stock index futures is driven by ``jealousy''
on Wall Street and ``regulatory imperialism'' at the SEC.
   In an informal session with reporters last Friday, Breeden said
his bid to acquire control of stock index futures was for the good
of the economy.
   ``This is a policy dispute,'' he said. ``This isn't a question
of turf.''

   Carl Icahn virtually conceded defeat in his
latest battle with USX Corp., but he remains convinced he will
ultimately win his crusade to boost the price of the steel-energy
conglomerate's stock.
   Icahn told shareholders at the USX annual meeting Monday he
might not have the crucial support of several big institutional
investors. He said his plan to break up USX and spin off its U.S.
Steel subsidiary apparently would fail.
   But the takeover strategist, who is USX's largest stockholder
with a 13.3 percent stake, told reporters he found ``a strong
nucleus of shareholders'' who believe management should do more to
improve the company's stock price.
   Icahn said he would keep talking to these shareholders, and he
predicted, ``I think there will definitely be some changes.''
   ``I think we made a statement,'' Icahn said of his non-binding
proposal, which would have separated the lackluster U.S. Steel from
the more robust Marathon Oil Co.
   Icahn may have been undaunted because he knows how to win this
game _ he's done it before.
   In 1988, Icahn lost a fight to unseat Texaco Inc.'s board of
directors at the oil giant's 1988 annual meeting. But several
months later, Texaco management decided to undertake a
restructuring _ including the sales of billions of dollars worth of
assets _ that Icahn had campaigned for as a means of boosting share
values.
   ``We were right at Texaco,'' Icahn told reporters Monday.
   ``We'll stick around to see that (stock) value appreciate,'' he
said of USX.
   Icahn made a hostile takeover bid for USX in the mid-1980s, but
he said another buyout offer is unlikely because the company's
``poison pill'' defense limits the number of shares he could buy.
   Before the meeting, observers said Icahn eventually could force
management to restructure aggressively even if his proposal failed.
The company has said it will continue its 10-year-old
restructuring, but management wants to accomplish it on its own
terms.
   There was no surge of support for Icahn apparent at Monday's
gathering. He received polite applause for his comments, but
shareholders who spoke in favor of management and against breaking
up the company got a slightly more enthusiastic response.
   The 3{-hour meeting was attended by some 600 shareholders, most
of them individual stockholders and retirees of USX subsidiaries.
   The meeting largely was uneventful _ the company's biggest
shareholders, the institutional investors, did not speak, and many
already had submitted their proxies. Results of the vote were not
expected for at least a week.
   Icahn got the most support from the crowd when he complained
about the USX stock price, which he contended would improve if his
plan were carried out and shareholders were issued separate stock
for U.S. Steel and for Marathon.
   The outcome of Monday's vote was being watched as an indicator
of how much strength takeover strategists have in the 1990s, now
that the debt-financed takeover boom has ended.
   In March, takeover strategist Harold Simmons lost a proxy fight
that sought to remove the board of directors at Lockheed Corp. The
biggest winners in that battle were institutional investors who
extracted concessions from Lockheed management.

   USX Corp. may have won its latest battle
with Carl Icahn, but the level of support for the takeover
strategist's break-up plan should keep pressure on management to
bolster the company's stock price.
   ``This is a corporation that has changed and will continue to
change. That is inevitable,'' USX Chairman Charles A. Corry said at
the company's annual meeting Monday.
   Most of the shareholders in attendance showed support for
management's fight against Icahn's proposal. It called for the
company to spin off its U.S. Steel subsidiary to shareholders,
leaving USX as an energy company with its Marathon Oil Co. unit,
which is based in Findlay.
   Icahn conceded his plan was likely to be defeated, but he said
he found a significant amount of support among major shareholders.
   Shareholder Bruce Schoenberger, a Toledo attorney, said he
favored Icahn's proposal because it would force management to
consider taking some kind of action to boost the stock's value.
   ``It requires them to at least look at some alternatives,'' he
said.
   About 600 people, mostly small shareholders and retirees,
attended the meeting in the auditorium of a junior high school.
   Institutional investors, the company's major shareholders, did
not speak and many already had submitted their proxies.
   It will take a week or longer to count the votes, said USX
spokesman William Keslar.
   Icahn contends the relatively weak steel business is hampering
USX's stock price and is a potential drag on the company if there
is an economic downturn.
   He said he was certain he had the support of the holders of
about 80 million shares, nearly one-third of the company's
outstanding common stock. But he said several key institutional
investors had not told him whether they would support his plan,
which Icahn said indicated they might have been leaning towards
management.
   He conceded he may lose the vote but was confident he had
succeeded in forcing management to make future changes to enhance
shareholder value.
   ``If we lose we still have an excellent mandate,'' Icahn said.
``Several of the large investors have said, `We agree with you,' he
said. ``They agree conceptually something has got to be done.''
   Most of the shareholders who spoke at the meeting supported
management, saying U.S. Steel needs the capital provided by the oil
business. They expressed fear the company could become a takeover
target if it sheds the steel business.
   ``I agree wholeheartedly there will be great need for capital
both in the oil and steel business,'' Icahn said in response to one
shareholder. ``But why should USX jeopardize the future of the oil
business, which is a jewel, and use that capital for steel?''
   Icahn received the most applause when he said USX stock is
greatly undervalued. The financier has argued that stock in
separate steel and energy companies would be worth a total of $48 a
share.
   USX closed down 50 cents at $33.50 a share Monday on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Peter Rosko, a shareholder and finance professor at the
University of Minnesota, said it was uncertain whether the stock
would appreciate that much, but he still favored Icahn's proposal.
   ``Neither division should subsidize the other. Neither should
cover the sins of the other,'' he said.
   In response to Corry's upbeat assessment of the company's 1989
results, Rosko asked, ``Why hasn't the stock moved?''
   The audience clapped when Rosko asked Corry to predict what USX
stock will be worth in 1992.
   Corry declined to answer, but said Icahn's analysis of past
growth could be misleading because it is based on certain narrow
periods.
   ``The stock price is what it is,'' Corry said. ``The real
question before stockholders doesn't deal with that.
   ``The question before stockholders is: Does this idea make
sense? Is it likely to improve things?''

   Chrysler Corp. today begins tooting
its own horn in advertisements that say two pairs of its cars beat
two Hondas in consumer testing.
   The campaign is the latest effort by the company to shore up its
declining sales by attacking Japanese competition head on.
   ``We're attacking the myth of complete infallibility of the
Japanese carmakers,'' Chrysler marketing Vice President John
Damoose said Monday at a media briefing on the new television,
radio and print advertising campaign.
   The company's campaign began in March with a television ad
showing Chairman Lee Iacocca pacing around a table of company
executives and saying the No. 3 U.S. automaker's cars are just as
good as their Japanese rivals _ but that no one knows it.
   The campaign also has included a six-city road show that winds
up later this month in Los Angeles with Iacocca reiterating that
theme.
   The automaker also has a safety campaign aiming at Japanese
automakers, which supply far fewer cars with air bags than Chrysler
does.
   Late last week, General Motors Corp. began a campaign enlisting
all of its active and retired employees and dealers to tell
friends, neighbors and acquaintances that the quality of GM cars
has improved during the last five years.
   Ford Motor Co.'s latest automobile advertisements make no
quality comparisons with Japanese products. It began its ``Quality
is Job One'' theme nine years ago and has no plans to change it.
   In its new ads, Chrysler will cite a study it commissioned
involving 200 Southern California owners of GM or Ford cars who
called themselves likely import-car buyers. The study had consumers
compare the Honda Accord with the Dodge Spirit and Plymouth
Acclaim, and the Honda Civic with the Dodge Shadow and Plymouth
Sundance.
   The Spirit and Acclaim are essentially the same car, as are the
Shadow and the Sundance.
   The researchers from U.S. Testing Co. Market Research Inc. of
Wheeling, Ill., found that after quizzing the consumers on 33
facets of the cars' operations, 83 percent preferred the
Spirit-Acclaim over the Accord and 76 percent preferred the
Sundance-Shadow over the Civic.
   Those results certainly are at odds with recent sales figures.
   The Accord was the best selling car in the United States last
year, with 362,707 driven off dealer lots. The best-selling
Chrysler car was the Dodge Dynasty, far down the list with 109,250
sold.
   Dennis Hill, president of the research company, said he didn't
know how many of the survey's participants actually bought one car
or the other. Chrysler spokesman A.C. Liebler and Hill declined to
say how much the study cost or how much the automaker was spending
on advertising.
   The ad campaign comes at a time when Chrysler's U.S. car sales
need a boost.
   Sales of Chrysler's cars slipped 21.8 percent through the first
four months of this year compared with last year. At the end of
April, the company's cars held 8.7 percent of the total car market
compared with 10.7 percent at the same time last year.
   Meantime, sales of Honda's cars have risen 4.4 percent, and
market share rose to 8.3 percent from 7.4 percent last year.
   Part of the slide in Chrysler's market share was due to scaling
back its presence in the fleet market, which Chrysler said was too
costly, and the absence of a subcompact car, a lack caused when the
company shut down a Detroit assembly plant in February.
   ``We knew this would happen,'' Liebler said of the market share
decline.
   Damoose and Liebler declined to say when the effects of the
advertising campaign should begin showing up in sales figures, but
both were confident that the ads would make a difference.

   At the supermarket industry's international trade
show, executives are finding out what it's like on the other side
of the cash register.
   They're taking a four-day shopping excursion, and the emphasis
along the aisles of the marathon McCormick Place convention center
is on the healthy, convenient and environmentally friendly.
   ``In past years, the ... convention has served as a springboard
for virtually all of the industry's significant innovations _ from
scanning to microwaveable foods,'' said Michael Muldoon, an
official of the show's sponsor, the Food Marketing Institute.
   ``In 1990, the convention will continue to play a vital industry
role, taking a hard look at the issues likely to dominate the
business in years to come _ especially food safety, health and
nutrition, environmental concerns and human resources,'' Muldoon
added in a statement.
   The trade show spanning 25 acres is billed as the largest annual
exhibition of its kind and is complete with pyramids of shiny red
apples and the aroma of buttery garlic bread samples.
   An estimated 35,000 visitors are expected to view the stocked
displays featured by about 1,000 companies during the show, which
ends Wednesday.
   Grocers of the 1990s are becoming increasingly concerned about
health, convenience and environmentally sensitive packaging as they
restock their supermarket shelves, said Timothy M. Hammonds, the
institute's senior vice president.
   ``It's happening largely because the baby-boom generation that
built the fast-food industry now have families and don't have
time,'' Hammonds said.
   At the same time, the industry is ``using more recyclable
material and paying more attention to solid waste,'' he said.
   Jerry Greenfield, co-creator of Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream,
typified the marketers' increased consumer awareness.
   On Monday, for example, Greenfield was busy scooping samples of
the company's new reduced-cholesterol Ben &amp; Jerry's Light, an ice
milk that the Waterbury, Vt., company introduced early this year.
   ``You won't get skinny eating Ben &amp; Jerry's Light, but you will
get one-third less fat and 40 percent less cholesterol,'' the
company's promotional material says.
   Like many other Americans, Greenfield said, ``I'm getting
concerned with my fat intake.''
   Among the executives sampling the ice milk was Richard Turici, a
general manager for Entenmann's Inc. The baked-goods company, based
on New York's Long Island, is removing the fat from its products.
   Turici said a new line of about 12 cholesterol-free, fat-free
cakes and cookies has pushed Entenmann's sales up 40 percent.
Healthier food is ``what's hot'' among today's consumers, Turici
said
   Kellogg Co. of Battle Creek, Mich., is promoting its
health-conscious image by offering to measure cholesterol levels in
a booth displaying packaging of two new cereals the company will be
marketing.
   ``It supports our image. Our products have no cholesterol,''
said Bud W. Morgan, vice president of the company's central zone.
Cereal, he said, also fulfills customers' need for convenience.
   The new cereals are Bigg Mixx and Kenmei Rice Bran. Bigg Mixx is
a combination of wheat, oat, corn and rice. Aimed at youngsters,
the cereal is packaged in a box featuring an animal that's a
curiously humorous combination of a chicken, a pig, a wolf and a
moose. Kenmei Rice Bran is a rice flake that Kellogg's hopes will
catch on the way oat bran cereals have.
   Responding to increased environmental awareness, several
companies exhibited recyclable grocery bags. Continental Extrusion
Corp. of Garden City, N.Y., for example, is marketing a re-usable
bag with handles of recyclable polyethylene resin.
   The customer buys a bag for 50 cents and gets 5 cents back each
time he or she brings it to the market. The bag should easily last
the 10 trips it takes to recoup the cost, said Robert Pachelbel, a
sales executive.
   ``The crux of the matter is ... you're reducing the amount of
waste being put out in landfills,'' said Pachelbel.
   The Washington-based Food Marketing Institute is a non-profit
international association with 1,600 members operating about 17,000
retail food stores.

<HEAD>CEO Resigns at Troubled Convenience-Store Chain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Karl Eller, an expansion-minded leader whose name
was synonymous with Circle K Corp. for seven years, has resigned as
chairman and chief executive of the debt-ridden convenience store
chain.
   Eller, 61, presided over an expansion that saw Circle K grow
from 1,200 stores in 1983 to the nation's second-largest
convenience chain with 4,685 in 33 states last November. In the
process, it rang up debts of $1.3 billion.
   No replacement was named Monday, but the company said president
Robert A. Dearth Jr., 45, would manage operations, with oversight
from the board of directors.
   Spokesman Ray Cox said Eller resigned to pursue personal
business opportunities.
   Cox said Eller and Circle K executives agreed not to comment
beyond a statement announcing the resignation.
   Eller said in the statement that with the company in the process
of restructuring, it was time for him to step aside and give the
directors the latitude to establish new objectives.
   Circle K last month halted interest payments to bondholders
under a plan designed to restructure its debt load. The agreement
with its senior creditors and its largest shareholder, American
Financial Corp., gave it a seven-month moratorium on debt and
interest payments.
   Circle K had threatened to file for reorganization under Chapter
11 of U.S. bankruptcy laws if it was denied a reprieve on its debts.
   The agreement gave bank lenders that have extended nearly $800
million in senior debt to Circle K the right to determine whether
the company can pay interest on subordinated debt. Officials have
said the restructuring could include exchanging some outstanding
subordinated debt securities for new bonds, stock or cash.
   Circle K is the nation's second-largest convenience store chain
behind Southland Corp., owner of 7-Eleven. Circle K has announced
plans to sell 350 stores in the Pacific Northwest and another 25 in
Hawaii, but Cox said neither sale had closed.
   Eller, a Circle K director since 1972, became chairman and chief
executive in June 1983.
   The growth in the number of U.S. stores _ in addition to 1,400
licensed or joint ventures overseas _ cost Circle K $850 million,
much of it raised through risky high-yield junk bonds issued by
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   In addition to rising interest payments, company officials have
blamed Circle K's problems on intense competition in the industry,
including the spread of convenience stores run by oil companies
able to sell gasoline more cheaply.
   Circle K in March announced a $40 million operating loss for the
quarter ended Jan. 31.
   Analysts said Eller, who in late 1988 told stockholders
expansion was the key to the company's survival, failed to provide
for stability after growth.
   ``He built the empire, but it's clear there wasn't anybody
beneath him. He didn't build the infrastructure to operate it,''
said Dennis Telzrow, an analyst with the Dallas brokerage Eppler,
Guerin &amp; Turner.
   Telzrow said Eller's departure was expected after Circle K hired
Dearth away from United Brands Co. in January.
   Sheryl Gillett Caudana, granddaughter of Circle K founder Fred
Hervey, also criticized Eller's management.
   ``I felt that he was making some decisions that were not in the
interests of either the long-term survival of the company or the
stockholders,'' she said.
   Eller in 1968 founded Combined Communications Corp. and in the
next decade built the company into one of the nation's largest
mass-media enterprises.
   He sold the company in 1979 to Gannett Co. and spent the next
four years as director of the communications division of Columbia
Pictures Industries and as a financial consultant in Phoenix.

<HEAD>Washington Bancorp To Tighten Management Practices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Washington Bancorporation, the second largest
banking concern in the nation's capital, has agreed to tighten
management practices and procedures after defaulting on about $26
million in short-term debt.
   The agreement with federal regulators includes a special review
of the company's real estate loans, the bank said in a statement
Monday.
   Washington Bancorp's commercial loan portfoilio is heavily
concentrated in real estate, a market that has gone into a slump in
recent months.
   Washington Bancorp, the parent of National Bank of Washington,
reported a $5.7 million loss for the first quarter of 1990 and a
sharp jump in its portfolio of nonperforming loans.
   The default on $26 million in debt occurred when unrelated banks
that had provided backup lines of credit withdrew those assurances,
the company said.

<TEXT>
   The European Community signed accords
Tuesday with East Germany and Bulgaria, virtually completing the
first stage of a bid to boost trade and economic links across a
once-divided continent.
   The EC already signed trade and economic cooperation pacts with
the Soviet Union, Hungary and Poland, and on Monday it finalized an
agreement with Czechoslovakia.
   Romania remains the only East European nation changing to
democracy and free enterprise with which the EC has no such accord.
Negotiations to replace a 1980 pact are expected to open soon.
   The 10-year accords with Eastern Europe provide for economic
cooperation in many sectors, including farming, the environment and
easing curbs on imports of East European goods.
   Currently, trade between Eastern Europe and the European
Community totals $50 billion a year, half of which involves the
Soviet Union.
   On April 28, the EC said it was ready to start a second stage of
economic relations with Eastern Europe: talks for association
accords that also cover political consultations.
   Yet some East Europeans are eager to become EC members quickly.
   Czechoslovakia wants to join by 1999. But the EC, citing
dramatic differences in economic development, has ruled out full
membership for the time being for any East European nation.
   One exception is East Germany, which will join after merging
with West Germany.
   The 10-year EC-East German accord on trade and economic
cooperation signed on Tuesday is a formality. It will be changed
once the two Germanys create an economic and monetary union and
will disappear with formal unification.
   Until then, Irish Foreign Minister Gerard Collins said, ``This
trade and economic cooperation agreement will help to bring the two
parties closer together.''
   Collins, whose country holds the EC's rotating presidency,
signed the East German and Bulgarian accords on behalf of the EC at
two separate ceremonies. Economics Minister Gerhard Pohl signed for
East Germany and Bulgarian Prime Minister Andrey Loukanov signed
for his country.
   Pohl said East Germany hoped to boost exports of machine tools,
textiles, chemicals and electronic products and looked forward to
foreign investments from the EC nations.
   ``Via technology transfer we will be able to get support for our
industries,'' he said.
   The EC-Bulgaria accord provides for ``improved market access
(for Bulgarian products) and commercial cooperation, which is an
important step towards Bulgarian membership of the General
Agreement of Tariffs and Trade,'' Collins said.

   The stock market was mixed in early trading
today as Wall Street awaited the first phase of the government's
record quarterly refunding auction.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose a scant .45 to
2,722.07 in the first half hour of trading.
   Advancing issues were nearly matched by declining ones in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
497 up, 426 down and 535 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 21.66 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Market analysts said stock prices could be affected by concern
about the Treasury's three-day refunding auction this week. The
first phase of the auction was scheduled for later today, when the
government planned to sell $10.5 billion worth of three-year notes.
   Lack of strong demand for the government securities over the
three days could send interest rates higher, hurting stock prices.
That could end the market's six straight days of gains, its longest
unbroken winning streak since October.
   But concern about interest rates was eased by Friday's
unemployment report for April, which said the jobless rate rose to
its highest level in over a year. That makes it less likely the
Federal Reserve would move to raise rates.
   Among blue-chip stocks in early trading, IBM rose &rsqb; to 110~,
Exxon was up &lsqb; to 46, General Electric rose \ to 66 and Philip
Morris was unchanged at 43&rsqb;.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.03 to 186.48. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index gained .32 to 347.65.
   On Monday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 11.26 to
2,721.62.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 3 on the NYSE, with 947
up, 553 down and 492 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 132.76 million shares, against 140.55

<HEAD>Say Star Signs Deal To Do Reebok Commercials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Singer and actress Madonna reportedly has signed a
deal to do commercials for Reebok shoes.
   The deal with the leading athletic shoe manufacturer is for at
least two commercials, the Boston Herald reported in Tuesday
editions, quoting a source it didn't identify.
   Neither Reebok nor its advertising agency, Hill, Holliday,
Connors, Cosmopulos in Boston, would confirm the deal.
   ``The association with Reebok and Madonna is a rumor. We have a
policy that we don't comment on rumors,'' said Bernadette Mansur, a
Reebok vice president in charge of marketing and communications.
   ``As a general matter, we don't talk about advertising until
such time as it is produced or aired,'' said Scott Cheyne of the
advertising agency.
   The star is beginning the United States part of her ``Blonde
Ambition'' world tour. The Dick Tracy movie in which she stars with
Warren Beatty is due out next month.
   Reebok and Madonna have been involved in separate, controversial
advertisements.
   Madonna made a commerical for Pepsi Cola last year that was
shown once and pulled because of viewer's confused it with a
separate music video the Madonna released at about the same time
that mixed sexual and religious imagery.
   Reebok, based in Stoughton, Mass., was criticized this year for
its commerical showing two ``bungee jumpers,'' one wearing Reebok
Pump shoes, the other wearing a competitor's athletic shoes.
   The one wearing Reeboks bounces back on a bungee cord, but the
other apparently doesn't make it, because the cord comes back
without the jumper.

<HEAD>Settle Battle Over Names, Cheese</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Old spaghetti may sound cold and clammy, but two
restaurant chains thought it was hot enough to fight over in court.
   The Old Spaghetti Warehouse, based in suburban Garland, has
agreed to drop the word ``old'' from its corporate moniker and will
pay $400,000 to settle litigation brought by an ``older''
competitor of nearly the same name.
   About three years ago, the owner of a Portland, Ore.-based chain
called the Old Spaghetti Factory filed two lawsuits against the
Texas chain.
   The owner alleged that the Old Spaghetti Warehouse had stolen a
recipe using mytzithra cheese _ a Greek cheese made from goat's
milk _ and copied the use of trolleys as booths.
   On Monday, Old Spaghetti Warehouse announced it would scrap
``old'' from the signs on its stores and delete any mention of
mytzithra cheese from its menu. But the Garland company, which
denies taking its competitor's sauce recipe, will continue to be
able to use the special cheese.
   ``We are pleased that the litigation is finally behind us,''
Robert Hawke, president of the 15-store, $28 million Texas company
said. ``This removes a cloud over our future and will allow us to
proceed with our franchise plans.''
   Old Spaghetti Warehouse opened its first restaurant in Dallas'
West End in 1972 and has since opened 14 other company-owned stores
in eight states. The company went public in 1985.
   The Old Spaghetti Factory chain was established in 1970 and has
28 stores.
   The lawsuits settled Monday were filed in federal court in
Atlanta, the only market in which both companies have stores.

<TEXT>
   J. Richard Munro, who led publishing giant Time
Inc. into a combination with entertainment powerhouse Warner
Communications Inc., said today he is stepping down as co-chairman
and co-chief executive of Time Warner Inc.
   The announcement, which came at the annual shareholders' meeting
of the world's biggest media and entertainment concern, came as no
surprise.
   When Time and Warner announced last year they planned to merge,
Munro said he planned to stay on for only a short time to share the
chairman and chief executive posts with Warner boss Steven J. Ross.
   As part of his employment contract, Munro also had a powerful
incentive to step down. He is eligible for deferred compensation of
nearly $4.3 million if he retires on or before May 31.
   His departure, effective Wednesday, automatically elevates
Nicholas J. Nicholas, the president of Time Warner, into the post
of co-chief executive with Ross. Nicholas, 50, is expected to
become the sole chief executive on Ross's retirement from that post
in July 1994.
   Munro, 59, joined the company in 1957 and became president and
chief executive in 1980. He has been chairman and chief executive
since Sept. 1, 1986, sharing those posts with Ross since Time
acquired a majority of Warner's stock last summer. The buyout was
completed earlier this year.
   Some Time Warner shareholders are unhappy that they were not
allowed to vote on a $200 a share takeover offer from Paramount
Communications Inc. that Time spurned in favor of its $14 billion
deal with Warner.
   Time's stock rose as high as $182.75 a share during last
summer's three-way takeover fight, but the stock of its successor
company, Time Warner, closed Monday at $94.50 a share on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Munro, Ross, and Nicholas have argued that their plans to
combine Time and Warner was a better deal for shareholders in the
long run than Paramount's $12.2 billion offer for Time would have
been.
   The Delaware Chancery Court backed them up, ruling in favor of
management's right to follow its own ``business judgment'' that a
combination of Time and Warner was the better course despite what
shareholders might have wanted.
   That comes as little comfort to some shareholders and their
advisors who note the company's stock is trading for less than half
of what Paramount offered and near its 52-week low of $87.50 a
share.
   ``Why should shareholders risk their money in American companies
when they are treated this way,'' William Steiner, a Time Warner
shareholder from Great Neck, N.Y., asked on the eve of the annual
meeting.
   Institutional Shareholder Services Inc., a Washington,
D.C.-based consulting firm that advises big shareholders,
recommended withholding votes for four former Time Inc. directors
up for election at today's meeting.
   ``Time management was faced here with a choice between a deal
carefully crafted to protect its own managers and one that was not,
but offered a substantial premium to shareholders,'' the consulting
firm said.
   The deal was completed earlier this year.
   The combined company is a leader in magazines, film production,
recorded music, pay television services and cable TV systems
operations.
   Despite a big debt load stemming from the merger, Time Warner
has launched a new weekly magazine, Entertainment Weekly; bought
the West Coast magazine and book concern Lane Publishing, and
acquired a 19.5 percent stake in the theme parks operator Six Flags
Corp. It sold the textbook publisher Scott Foresman and Co.
   The company recently reported a $187 million loss in the first
quarter compared with a loss of $217 million a year earlier. The
losses reflected the costs of the buyout of Warner.
   But it also noted that operating income for the quarter _
excluding interest, taxes and costs of the merger _ was up 16
percent at $536 million, while revenue rose to $2.74 billion from
$2.55 billion.

<HEAD>Republicans Say Bush Willing to Discuss Possible Tax Increases</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Combines pvs; no pickup</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush likely will rule out raising
income taxes but is willing to discuss other tax increases, ranging
from a national sales tax to higher levies on alcohol and
cigarettes, Republican lawmakers said today.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, however, said that the
White House would withhold comment on any specific tax _ including
income taxes _ in an effort to get unbiased deficit-cut talks
launched.
   ``We start these negotiations from scratch,'' Fitzwater said. He
said the type of tax increases that might emerge from a White
House-Congress budget summit were ``up to the negotiators.''
   ``We aren't specifying what's under consideration. There are no
preconditions,'' Fitzwater said.
   Bush, having abandoned his ``no-new-taxes'' pronouncements,
discussed taxes with congressional GOP leaders after Budget
Director Richard Darman delivered a gloomy assessment of the
economy, said participants at a White House meeting.
   Darman told the GOP lawmakers that automatic budget cuts in the
range of $45 billion to $55 billion _ and possibly even more _
could take place next fall in the absence of major additional
deficit-cutting steps, according to both GOP lawmakers and
Fitzwater.
   Republicans said that a range of possible taxes and new ways of
ranging revenue were discussed at today's White House meeting.
   ``Value-added taxes, taxes on booze and cigarettes, a national
lottery, a one-cent national sales tax, all sorts of things like
that are in the mix,'' said Assistant Senate Republican Leader Alan
K. Simpson of Wyoming.
   However, he added, ``Nobody's talking about raising income tax
rates.''
   At the hour-long White House session, participants said, Darman
told the lawmakers that an automatic budget cut in excess of $55
billion was likely this fall in the absence of major new
deficit-cutting steps.
   That could chop about 20 percent across the board in defense and
most domestic programs.
   Despite the president's earlier pledge against new taxes,
Simpson said, Bush ``is fully aware that he's got a country to run.
And he's got to do that in a responsible way because lots of
figures have changed.''
   Simpson, speaking to reporters in the driveway outside the White
House, said Darman had spelled out spending cuts so massive that
they would be ``totally unacceptable to the American people.''
   Participants said Bush listened as GOP lawmakers discussed a
variety of tax options, but that he did not voice his own opinion
on any particular tax.
   However, the president reiterated his position that there be no
``preconditions.''
   ``We're going to see the economic jitters set in unless somebody
assumes some responsibility for the budget,'' said Sen. Thad
Cochran, R-Miss. ``The president is trying to do this. And I
applaud him for it.''
   House Assistant Republican Leader Newt Gingrich of Georgia said
Republicans would not agree to any plan that would hurt them in an
election year.
   ``I'm not going to vote for anything which causes us to lose
politically...and we're not going to agree to stupid deals,''
Gingrich said.
   Asked what kind of taxes might be raised, Gingrich said: ``I
don't know. We'll have to wait and see what the Democrats want to
discuss.''
   GOP leaders have hailed Bush's ice-breaking overtures on the
budget.
   Democratic leaders of the House and Senate, meantime, were
meeting with rank-and-file members to gauge their feelings about
budget bargaining in an election year.
   Sixteen top Democrats met for an hour Monday in a closed-door
session.
   ``We've had different views expressed,'' House Speaker Thomas S.
Foley, D-Wash., said afterward.
   Pressure has been building for action on the budget because of
the slowing economy and the increasing cost projections of the
federal bailout of the savings and loan industry.
   The weaker the economy, the less revenue the government can
expect to collect and the greater the federal deficit.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said erlier there would
be ``no preconditions'' for budget negotiations. Republicans denied
that such a statement is inconsistent with Bush's campaign pledge
of ``no new taxes.''
   ``There isn't any president who hasn't tried to make good on his
promises. There's no president who hasn't lived through times that
change, and maybe outdate some promises,'' said Rep. Bill Frenzel
of Minnesota, top Republican on the House Budget Committee.
   Last week, the House passed a Democratic-written spending plan
that includes $36 billion in deficit reduction. The Senate Budget
Committee approved another Democratic plan containing $43 billion
in savings. Both proposals would give the military nearly $10
billion less next year than Bush wants.
   Bush proposed a budget in January claiming to shrink the
shortfall by $36 billion to just under $64 billion. The
Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law requires that next year's budget
gap not exceed $64 billion.

   The dollar rose against most major foreign
currencies today in moderate European trading. Gold prices fell.
   Dealers said trading was affected by uncertainty over the
outcome of this week's U.S. Treasury refunding auction, the results
of which could influence interest rates and therefore the dollar's
value. Higher U.S. interest rates would make the dollar worth more;
lower rates would make the dollar weaken.
   Some dealers also expressed reluctance to trade dollars too
heavily ahead of the Friday release of the April U.S. retail sales
figures and producer prices, which could provide more insight into
the U.S. economy and also influence the dollar's value.
   The dollar appears to be in a narrow range for the time being,
said Jens-Uwe Fischer, a senior dealer at Manufacturers Hanover in
Frankfurt, but other dealers said there was room for further
declines.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 158.13 Japanese yen from
157.80 yen at Monday's close. Later, in London, it fell to 157.92
yen. By midday in New York the dollar was trading at about 157.90
yen.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.6697 from $1.6710 late
Monday on European markets. London markets were closed Monday for a
national bank holiday. In New York at midday today, the pound
fetched $1.6701.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday:
1.6580 West German marks, up from 1.6550; 1.4332 Swiss francs, up
from 1.4320; 5.5710 French francs, up from 5.5555; 1.8635 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.8590; 1,216.00 Italian lire, up from 1,213.50;
1.1630 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1617.
   Other dollar rates in New York at midday: 1,215.30 Italian lire;
1.6585 West German marks, 1.1630 Canadian dollars and 1.4327 Swiss
francs.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $369.75 a troy ounce,
down from $371.45 bid late Friday. The London gold market was
closed Monday.

   The White House today defended its threat to
veto a bill guaranteeing unpaid leave for workers with family
emergencies, saying that requiring the benefits could drive up
unemployment.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President Bush urges
companies to provide paid parental leaves voluntarily, but he is
unwilling to force them to do it.
   Fitzwater defended the adminstration's stance amid criticism
from the measure's sponsor that it is a rebuff to working families.
   ``It would be most unfortunate if my party, which so strongly
supports family values, were to turn its back on working families,
women, children, grandma and grandpa,'' said Rep. Marge Roukema,
R-N.J.
   At one point in his daily news briefing Fitzwater suggested that
workers ``look for other jobs'' if they or their unions could not
negotiate parental leave with their employer.
   He later backed off that suggestion, saying, ``The high priority
is to make work and family complementary. ... We urge all employers
to find sensitive and flexible leave policies, but the government
should not dictate it.''
   ``These are the kinds of rigidity that cause companies to not be
able to hire people, and cause greater levels of unemployment,''
Fitzwater said.
   ``It's at the point at which it becomes mandatory that we say
the negative risks outweigh the benefits,'' he said.
   White House chief of staff John Sununu assured business leaders
in a private meeting Monday that Bush would veto the family and
medical leave bill scheduled for House action Wednesday. His threat
was recounted by business lobbyists who attended the session and
was confirmed by a Sununu aide who asked not to be identified by
name.
   The bill has bipartisan support but is opposed by business
groups. It requires employers with 50 or more workers to offer
unpaid time off with job and benefit protection for the care of
newborn, newly adopted or seriously ill children, as well as to
deal with personal health problems or ill spouses or parents.
   Roukema, the chief Republican sponsor, called the veto threat
``a complete surprise.'' She earlier had urged the White House to
avoid veto threats or ``rash statements.''
   ``It's a job security issue for working families,'' Roukema said.
   The bill's Democratic sponsors denounced the veto threat and
said the move would be at odds with Bush's 1988 campaign support
for family values.
   ``I can't believe the kinder, gentler president is going to veto
it,'' said Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo.
   She said Sununu took leave from his job as a professor at Tufts
University while he served as governor of New Hampshire _ and kept
job benefits from the university.
   ``Sununu took family leave himself, and I think he has a lot of
nerve,'' Mrs. Schroeder said.
   Mary Tavenner, a lobbyist for the National Association of
Wholesaler-Distributors, said businesses opposed the measure
because of its cost and contended that many employers already offer
better benefits.
   ``There's only so many things an employer can offer,'' she said.
   Tavenner and Christine Russell, lobbyist for the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, were among the business representatives invited to the
White House meeting. Although there have been proposals to change
the length of guaranteed leave, they quoted Sununu as saying Bush
would veto any period that was required by law.
   ``He basically said the president would veto anything that is a
mandated benefit,'' Tavenner said.
   Under the House bill, employers would have to offer up to 10
weeks of unpaid family leave over a two-year period, and up to 15
weeks in one year for a sick worker.
   An employee returning from leave must be restored to his or her
previous job or an equivalent position, and employers would have to
continue health insurance benefits for those on leave.
   Federal workers would have the same guarantees with a longer
unpaid leave: 18 weeks for family leave over two years and 27 weeks
a year for medical leave.

   Stock prices were little changed today as the
market awaited results of the first phase of a record-sized
offering of government debt securities.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose a marginal .90 to
2,722.52 as of 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Declining issues slightly outnumbered advancing ones in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
665 up, 679 down and 550 unchanged.
   Analysts said stock prices were affected by concern about the
Treasury's three-day refunding auction this week of $30.5 billion
in notes and bonds. The first phase of the auction was scheduled
for later today, when the government planned to sell $10.5 billion
worth of three-year notes.
   Lack of strong demand for the notes and bonds could send
interest rates higher, hurting stock prices. That could end the
market's six straight days of gains, its longest unbroken winning
streak since October.
   But concern about interest rates was eased by Friday's
unemployment report for April, which showed less job growth than
expected. The report makes it less likely the Federal Reserve would
act to raise rates as an inflation-fighting move.
   Among most-active blue-chip stocks, IBM rose &lsqb; to 110|, General
Electric gained &lsqb; to 65~ and Philip Morris was unchanged at 43&rsqb;.
   CalFed led the list of most-active stocks, rising \ to 17{ as

index gained .14 to 347.47.

<HEAD>EC Opens Dumping Inquiry on South Korean Car Radios</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Community's executive
commission Tuesday opened an anti-dumping inquiry into car radio
imports from South Korea after receiving a complaint from an
industry group.
   The anti-dumping complaint was brought by the Association for
Legal-Auto Radio Measures, comprised of major European
manufacturers Philips NV, Grundig AG, and Blaupunkt-Werke GmbH.
   The group, which makes more than 70 percent of EC-made car
radios, said that by forcing EC car radio prices down, the South
Korean exporters had caused considerable profit cuts and job cuts
among EC manufacturers.
   According to the complaint, 5.8 million South Korean car radios
were sold in the 12-nation trade bloc in 1988, up from 1.7 million
in 1985, raising South Korea's market share to 32 percent from 14
percent.
   The EC manufacturers' share in their own market fell during the
same period to 33 percent from 49 percent.
   If the South Korean companies are found to have been dumping car
radios on the European market at prices lower than at home, the EC
can impose retaliatory duties on their car radio exports.
   In a statement, the commission said a comparison between
internal South Korean prices for car radios and prices charged for
comparable exports to the EC showed that ``the alleged dumping
margins are important.''
   The South Korean concerns named in the complaint are Sinbang
Electronics Co.; Korea Electronics Co.; Osio Electronics Co.;
Carspec Electronics Co.; Sunkyong Limited; Woojin Electric Co.;
Tongkook Electronics Co.; Hyundai Electronics Co.; Daewoo
Corporation; Haitai International Inc.; Sherwood (Inkel), Dongwon
Electronics Co.; Samsung Electronics Co.; and Shindong Electronics
Co.

   Fewer dollars may be involved, but prosecutors
say the trial of three futures traders concerns offenses no less
serious than those committed by Wall Street felons Ivan Boesky and
Michael Milken.
   ``Cheating is cheating,'' said U.S. Attorney Ira Raphaelson.
   Jury selection began today in the U.S. District Court trial of
Robert D. Mosky, Danny L. Scheck and David Zatz, three traders of
Swiss franc futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. They are
accused of swindling customers.
   They represent one of four groups of Chicago futures traders _
47 in all _ who were indicted last year after an unprecedented
sting. FBI agents posing as corrupt traders secretly tape recorded
conversations that the government contends reveal organized fraud
among traders at the Merc and the rival Chicago Board of Trade, the
world's two largest futures exchanges.
   U.S. District Judge Ann C. Williams decided Monday and today to
allow defense lawyers to introduce evidence of their clients'
lawful behavior to show that the difference between legal and
illegal trading is unclear.
   Also stung by the investigation was a clerk who has pleaded
guilty, along with 15 of the traders, to reduced charges in
exchange for cooperation with prosecutors. None has been sentenced.
   Prosecutors have not revealed how much money they believe was
stolen by traders, saying only that the alleged schemes involved
hundreds of investors and thousands of trades.
   The scandal dealt a black eye to the reputation of the futures
markets, which already were perceived as freewheeling, in much the
same way the insider trading cases of the 1980s tarnished the image
of the stock market.
   The Chicago exchanges and their federal regulators responded
with tougher anti-fraud measures, and Congress is considering
proposals to strengthen the integrity of the markets.
   New York commodities lawyer Thomas Russo said the scandal
probably involves less money and public harm than the Wall Street
insider trading cases, in which Boesky and Milken paid fines and
restitution totaling $700 million to settle criminal charges.
   But Russo said: ``I think the amount of money is not the
material issue in these cases. It goes beyond dollars to the
integrity of the markets.''
   Mosky, Scheck and Zatz are charged with multiple counts of mail
or wire fraud and violations of the federal Commodity Exchange Act.
Each count carries up to five years in prison.
   Mosky also is charged with racketeering conspiracy, for which he
could be sent to prison for 20 years and be forced to forfeit
personal assets including exchange membership.
   In court documents, the government has portrayed Mosky as a
ringleader who persuaded Scheck and Zatz to accept the
responsibility and costs of trading errors he made while executing
customer orders in the Swiss franc trading pit.
   The government contends Mosky later repaid Scheck and Zatz by
manipulating customer orders, sometimes via trades conducted
illegally outside the pit.
   The government's evidence includes the FBI tapes, mountains of
trading records and the expected testimony of two other Swiss franc
traders, each of whom pleaded guilty in August.

<HEAD>Teamsters Chief Praises Strike Bill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Teamsters General President William McCarthy
has warned Congress that the 1.8 million-member union will not
contribute to any political candidates who do not support a bill
that protects strikers' jobs.
   Union officials attending a convention of about 800 union
members that began Monday voiced praise for the bill sponsored by
U.S. Rep. William Clay.
   McCarthy said the bill was critical to the survival of the labor
movement.
   The bill would bar companies from permanently replacing striking
workers with new employees. Clay, D-St. Louis, is one of labor's
strongest allies in Washington.
   In a statement recalling Clay's criticism of former President
Ronald Reagan's firing of striking air-traffic controllers in the
early 1980s, Clay said his bill would ``stop this insanity ... and
save the labor movement from annihilation.''
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-St. Louis, told the Teamsters that such
a law was needed because most U.S. companies had adopted an
attitude that ``greed is good.''
   ``The majority feel that the way to compete is to beat it out of
your workers ... break them if you can,'' Gephardt said.
   Daniel Ligurotis, chairman of the Central Conference of
Teamsters, said the right to strike was being abridged by the
hiring of replacement workers.
   ``This repulsive practice, which in the past was done only by
the most vicious employers, is now the rule rather than the
exception,'' he said.
   The Teamsters union contains five conferences: Central, South,
East, West and Canadian. The Central is the largest, with 491,000
members in 13 Midwestern states, including Missouri and Illinois.
Missouri has 50,000 Teamsters.
   The Central Conference meets every four years. This year's
convention is being held at the St. Louis Sheraton Hotel and runs
through Friday.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed lower
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as traders sold to take
profits despite reports the Soviet Union was in the market for a
major wheat purchase.
   At the opening, wheat prices gained support from reports the
Soviets were buying 550,000 metric tons of wheat under the export
bonus program.
   But technical selling set in with the lack of follow-through
buying by traders.
   Corn was performing well through most of the day as the market
reacted to Monday's announcement that the Soviets purchased 1.75
million metric tons of corn.
   William Biedermann, an analyst with Allendale Inc., said many
traders have concluded there will be no further purchases by the
Soviets.
   Soybean prices drifted lower due to low buyer interest at
current prices, Biedermann said.
   At the close, wheat was 2} cents to 6{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.78 a bushel; corn was 2\ cents
lower to a \ cent higher with May at $2.88{ a bushel; oats were 1\

<TEXT>
   International Paper Co.'s shareholders
overwhelmingly re-elected six directors to the board Tuesday
despite calls from a union representative to bring ``new blood''
into the company.
   Although most of the proxy ballots were submitted before the
morning meeting, a union representative criticized the board's
selection and urged shareholders to withhold their votes.
   ``There's no new blood, no new ideas,'' said Ed Garvey, an
attorney for the United Paperworkers International Union, which has
members who work in International Paper's mills.
   The company, which reported a 19.3 percent drop in its first
quarter earnings, is engaged in a labor dispute involving union
members at several U.S. mills where employees have been working
with a contract, said Garvey.
   The paperworkers union, which represents about 28,000 of the
company's 30,000 hourly workers, is not threatening to strike
because several strikes in recent years at individual mills were
unsuccessful, Garvey said. Striking workers were replaced, he said.
   During the meeting, Garvey said many workers perceive John A.
Georges, International Paper's chairman and chief executive, as the
``Frank Lorenzo of the paper industry.'' Lorenzo, chairman of
Houston-based Texas Air Corp., has been involved in bitter labor
disputes and strikes with that company's Eastern and Continental
Airlines subsidiaries.
   About 250 people attended the 1{-hour meeting during which
several people urged management to negotiate with union locals.
   The six directors were re-elected to the 14-member board by more
than 99 percent of the vote. They were Georges; Roger B. Smith,
chairman and chief executive officer of General Motors Corp.;
Willard C. Butcher, chairman and chief executive of Chase Manhattan
Corp.; Thomas C. Graham, president of the USS division of USX
Corp.; Donald F. McHenry, a Georgetown University professor; and
Edmund T. Pratt, chairman and chief executive of Pfizer Co.
   Purchase, N.Y.-based International Paper is the world's largest
producer of such products as packaging papers, business
communications papers, commercial and magazine printing papers,
corrugated containers, photographic papers and films, lumber and
wood products.
   International Paper also is involved in oil and gas exploration
and drilling and real estate. The company's 1989 sales totaled
$11.4 billion.
   For the 1990 first quarter, International Paper's earnings
declined to $180 million from $223 million for the same period in
1989. First quarter sales were $3.2 billion this year and $2.6
billion a year ago.
   Georges told shareholders that although 1989 was a ``great
year,'' growth was expected to slow.
   ``Our view of the (domestic) economy in 1990 anticipates GNP
growth in the area of 1.5 to 2.0 percent. If this holds true,
operating rates of most of our major businesses should hold up
reasonably well although these rates will be lower than in 1989,''
he said. ``Prices in some product lines have declined, and they
remain under pressure.''
   But Georges also said that recent European acquisitions ``put us
in a very good position to participate in the continent's economic
growth.''
   Shareholders also rejected proposals to divest the company's
investments in South Africa and adopt a confidential voting
procedure.
   The South Africa proposal has been rejected at past meetings.
The board opposed it, saying that Masonite Ltd., a producer of wood
and other fibers, has a ``distinguished record in race relations,''
Georges said.
   In addition, about 92 percent of the workforce is non-white, he
said. The facility is integrated and provides equal pay for equal
work, he said.

   Texaco Inc. said Tuesday that bad weather in
the Gulf of Mexico prevented divers from investigating and
repairing a broken pipeline that has leaked about 37,000 gallons of
oil.
   Texaco spokesman Max Hebert said the leak in the 20-inch
pipeline apparently had stopped and oil was breaking up in rough
seas. The largest slick is about a mile long and 400 yards wide,
though still far from shore, he said.
   The leak from the Texaco-operated Eugene Island pipeline
occurred about 100 miles off the Louisiana coast.
   Winds of 25 miles per hour and four-foot to six-foot seas
prevented Texaco's three skimmers from removing any oil from the
water. More bad weather was forecast for Thursday.
   The 112-mile-long pipeline, which serves 36 drilling platforms,
is operated by Texaco and owned by Texaco, Marathon Oil Co., Exxon
Corp., Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and Conoco Inc.
   The system, in which oil from offshore wells is piped to shore,
was shut down early Monday. The pipeline normally handles about
95,000 barrels a day.
   Texaco Chairman Alfred DeCrane mentioned the spill at the
company's annual meeting Tuesday and said Texaco was committed to
the environment and had has practiced ways to deal with spills.
   Separately, Texaco President and Chief Executive James Kinnear
said the company plans to invest in new technology to increase
reserves from existing fields by 14,000 barrels a day in 1990 and
1991.
   In addition, a total of $365 million will be invested in
refineries to allow production of an additional 85,000 barrels a
day in the United States and 39,000 abroad, he said.

   H&amp;R Block Inc. said Tuesday it prepared
14 million tax returns in its fiscal year ended April 30, a 7.1
percent rise over the previous year.
   H&amp;R Block, which won't report 1990 corporate earnings until
June, said the number of returns prepared by its company-owned and
franchised offices worldwide was up from 13.1 million returns in
fiscal 1989.
   The figures do not include refunds prepared elsewhere but
brought to H&amp;R Block to be filed with the IRS electronically.
   A total of 2.9 million returns were filed electronically under
the company's Rapid Refund program, up from 825,279 the previous
fiscal year.
   Rapid Refund was in operation in virtually all U.S. offices
during the 1990 tax filing season, compared to only one-third of
company-owned and two-thirds of franchised offices during the 1989
tax filing season, H&amp;R Block said.

   Stock prices rose today as the market cheered
the outcome of the first phase of a record-sized auction of
government debt securities.
   The Treasury's quarterly refunding auctioning included $30.5
billion in notes and bonds sold over three days. At the first
segment of the auction, held today, the government sold $10.5
billion worth of three-year notes at an average yield of 8.74
percent.
   The note sale, whose results were released minutes before the
market closed, was considered a success, said Dudley Eppel,
managing director of equity trading at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
Securities Corp.
   Stock prices traded in a narrow range as the market awaited the
auction's outcome. But after the results were made public, prices
jumped in the final few minutes of trading.
   Lack of strong demand for the notes and bonds could send
interest rates higher, hurting stock prices.
   But concern about interest rates was eased by Friday's
unemployment report for April, which showed lower job growth than
expected. The report makes it less likely the Federal Reserve would
act to raise rates as an inflation-fighting move.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 11.94 to 2,733.56.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by about 6 to 5 on
the New York Stock Stock Exchange, with 798 up, 642 down and 529
unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 144.23 million shares, against 132.76
million in the previous session.
   The NYSE's composite index rose .66 to 187.11.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose .25
to 347.58.

<DATELINE>TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. was fined $58,900 for dozens
of safety violations at its two Jeep plants in Toldeo, the federal
Occupational Safety and Health Administration said Tuesday.
   OSHA area director Arnis Andersons said Chrysler was cited for
68 violations, including a lack of machinery and equipment guards,
improperly stored flammable material, inadequate wiring and
employees without protective eyewear.
   The inspection from November through February was initiated
after a Jeep employee complained in October about several alleged
safety problems, Andersons said.
   The plants employ 5,300 people and produce Jeep Cherokee and
Grand Wagoneer models.
   Chrysler spokesman Lee Sechler said that the company had not
reviewed the report, but the company would correct any problems
``that our safety and health people agree need to be corrected.''
   Despite the fines, Andersons said the plants, built at the turn
of the century, did well considering their age and size.
   ``There has been remarkable, remarkable improvement from what we
saw from a safety point of view,'' he said. ``They are really
striving to improve the workplace conditions.''
   Andersons said OSHA the Toledo plants had not been examined in
seven years and had a high employee accident rate in the past.

<HEAD>One-Stop Shopping, More Low-Fat Foods Predicted for Future
Supermarkets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supermarkets will have to offer more low-fat
products, environmentally conscious policies and one-stop shopping
conveniences like banking to compete in the 1990s, industry leaders
said Tuesday.
   The ``mom and pop'' grocery may be taking a step into the past
at the Food Marketing Institute's trade show, which covers more
than 1 million square feet of space and involves more than 1,000
companies, chiefly food retailers.
   Topics of discussion include new-age trends such as
``micromarketing'' to target individual tastes of shoppers and
hiring more minorities to help erase an image of a white-male
dominated business.
   ``The supermarket truly is the microcosm of the lifestyle of
America,'' and must reflect the changes in lifestyle to survive,
said Timothy Hammonds, senior vice president of the Food Marketing
Institute.
   The Washington-based group, whose 1,600 members operate about
19,000 retail food stores nationwide, said a survey of 1,005
shoppers found that fat content beat cholesterol and salt as the
biggest nutrition concern for consumers.
   The nationwide survey, based on telephone interviews, was
conducted in January and released Tuesday, the third day of the
four-day meeting.
   Two years ago cholesterol was the biggest concern, Hammonds said.
   Shoppers surveyed this year said they are buying more fruits and
vegetables, more chicken and fish, and less meat and fatty
products. Store managers are responding to these changes by
stocking their shelves accordingly, Hammonds said.
   An increasing number of supermarkets are addressing the nation's
solid-waste crisis by recycling, said Patrick Collins, president of
Ralphs Grocery Co., a supermarket chain based in the Los Angeles
area.
   Collins said 87 percent of wholesalers and retailers pick up
recyclable waste products from their stores for consolidation at
distribution centers.
   Another trend is one-stop shopping, which has turned the
neighborhood grocery store into a self-contained mini-mall offering
services ranging from in-store restaurants to banking.
   ``All supermarkets will be doing that'' to meet the needs and
time pressures of two-income families, Hammonds said.
   ``It doesn't mean the small store or convenience store is going
to go away, but they'll have to specialize'' to stay afloat, he
said.
   As more women and minorities enter the work force, supermarkets
must make an effort to hire them, and not just for entry-level
positions, said Henry Hailstock, manager of minority affairs for
Giant Food, Inc., a Washington-based supermarket chain.
   Giant has worked with local college placement directors to
recruit minority students, and has established internships designed
to provide on-the-job training for minorities.
   The effort is aimed in part at promoting the retail industry as
a career, and not just as a part-time job, Hailstock said.

<HEAD>MIT Not Only Responsible For New England Growth, But California
Too</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLISON J. PUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, which took credit last year for the explosive growth of
the New England economy in the 1980s, now can point to a new study
that says its graduates have built up Silicon Valley too.
   But the report's author and officials at other schools caution
against reading too much into the work.
   MIT alumni have started some 176 companies in northern
California, accounting for about $22 billion in sales and more than
90,000 jobs, according to a report conducted by Chase Manhattan
Bank for the research university.
   About 90 of the companies are in Silicon Valley, the region
south of San Francisco named for its concentration of high-tech
businesses.
   ``It shows there's been a remarkable concentration of MIT alumni
who have contributed to the formation and growth of Silicon
Valley,'' said John Larson, an MIT fundraiser.
   But the report's author said the findings did not necessarily
point to a single-school domination of the region.
   ``If you added up for all the schools (in the nation) the list
of the companies they considered to be related to the school, the
sum of all those on the list would exceed the population of
companies in this country by a wide margin,'' said Richard
Aspinwall, the Chase Manhattan vice president and economist who
conducted the study.
   Also, many companies have several founders, not all of whom went
to the same school, and many founders may have been educated at
more than one institution. For example, a company might have been
founded by three people who are graduates of MIT, Harvard and
Stanford, Aspinwall said.
   Officials at other schools also discouraged drawing too many
conclusions from the study.
   ``We have an awful lot of graduates too that are walking around
Silicon Valley,'' said a professor of electrical engineering and
computer science at the University of California at Berkeley.
   ``It's very difficult to get in to MIT, students have to be very
bright and ambitious, but exactly the same is true for Stanford,
exactly the same is true for us,'' said the professor, who declined
to be identified.
   ``The tie (in Silicon Valley) to Stanford is much stronger than
to MIT,'' said Karen Bartholomew, a Stanford spokeswoman.
   Jim Aisner, a spokesman for Harvard Business School, echoed:
``I'm sure a lot of Harvard Business grads have founded lots of
firms. A good number of our grads go on to be entrepreneurs.''
   Still, he said, ``there are an awful lot of good schools. This
makes perfect sense that a lot of those firms were founded by MIT
graduates.''
   The Chase report is not the first such study for MIT. Last year,
the Bank of Boston did a study of the companies begun by MIT
graduates in the Massachusetts area.
   That report, released in June, said 636 businesses started by
MIT graduates in Massachusetts accounted for more than 300,000 jobs
in the state and about $10 billion in annual income for state
residents.
   Although the Massachusetts economy has hit hard times, and
growth in California has slowed as well, MIT can point to its
graduates as a driving force in Silicon Valley, Aspinwall said.
   ``The companies started by MIT graduates in Silicon Valley have
been sources of strength,'' Aspinwall said. ``The companies have
grown more rapidly than their industry as a whole, and they've
grown more rapidly than companies in Silicon Valley as a whole.''
   Abe Lederman, who graduated from MIT in 1981 with a master's
degree in computer science, was one of five MIT alumni who founded
Verity Inc., a computer software manufacturer based in Mountain
View, Calif.
   ``MIT prepared you to work really hard and (taught) the
entrepreneurial ethic and stuff. At MIT people are pretty smart and
all that,'' said Lederman, 32. ``What helps being at MIT is having
all these really bright people that work really hard.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar closed mixed in U.S. foreign exchange
trading Tuesday after strengthening slightly in Europe, but money
brokers said the underlying direction of the American currency
remained unclear.
   Gold prices fell. Republic National Bank in New York quoted
bullion at $369.90 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down $1.80 from
late Monday.
   Currency strategists said a few outside influences were
affecting the dollar Tuesday, notably pent-up appetite for dollars
in London after a three-day holiday weekend there and a
surprisingly good sale of new U.S. debt securities at a quarterly
Treasury refunding auction in Washington.
   The dollar demand helped strengthen the currency, but the
Treasury auction discouraged dollar buying because it suggested
U.S. interest rates won't rise significantly, some traders said.
That could make the dollar less attractive to foreign investors
relative to other key currencies.
   Despite the Treasury auction's immediate effect, Zlatko
Glamuzina, chief dealer at the New York branch of Banco di Sicilia,
suggestedthe long-term trend for dollars would remain strong.
   But Scott Greene, chief dealer for the New York branch of
Switzerland's Banco Julius Baer &amp; Co., suggested that the currency
of choice increasingly looked like the West German mark, reflecting
the optimism about the economic dynamism expected from a reunited
Germany.
   ``The vulnerable side is the down side for the dollar,'' Greene
said. ``All we need is a slight push there.''
   Others expressed reluctance to trade dollars, preferring to
await the final outcome of the Treasury auction, which goes through
Thursday, as well as any economic insight derived from statistics
on April U.S. retail sales and inflation, due to be released Friday.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to 158.13 Japanese yen from 157.80 yen
Monday. Later in London it fell to 157.92 yen. By the time trading
closed in New York the dollar fetched 157.63 yen, down from 158.15
yen Monday.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.6697 from $1.6710 late
Monday on European markets. London markets were closed Monday for a
national bank holiday. By the time trading closed in New York the
pound fetched $1.6705, worth more than its $1.6685 value late
Monday.
   Other late-dollar rates in New York compared with late-Monday
levels: 1.6575 West German marks, up from 1.6556; 1.4310 Swiss
francs, unchanged; 1.1639 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1633; 5.5685
French francs, up from 5.5615; 1,216.00 Italian lire, up from
1,214.50.
   In gold trading, bullion for immediate delivery on the New York
Commodity Exchange fell $1.90 a troy ounce to $370.00. Earlier in
London, gold fell $369.75, down from $371.45 bid Friday. The London
market was closed Monday.
   In Zurich, gold fell $1.70 an ounce to $369.00, and in Hong Kong
gold rose 32 cents to $373.42.
   Silver for immediate delivery fell 2.7 cents an ounce to $4.989
on the New York Commodity Exchange. Earlier in London silver fell 4
cents an ounce to $5.01.

   Philip Morris Cos. said Tuesday it will move 500
jobs, almost one third of its Manhattan work force, to a half-empty
building it owns north of New York City.
   The company said its Manhattan offices have become overcrowded
and its lease on additional rented office space in the city expires
in September 1991.
   Moving are Philip Morris International, the company's overseas
tobacco arm, and Philip Morris Capital Corp., a financial services
company.
   The relocation to the former General Foods Corp. headquarters in
Rye Brook in Westchester County will begin this year and should
take about a year, spokeswoman Alice T. McGillion said.
   Philip Morris acquired the building when it bought General Foods
in 1985. Many of the employees there moved to Glenview, Ill., after
Philip Morris bought Kraft in 1988 and formed Kraft General Foods.
   Philip Morris currently employs 1,700 people in New York City.
No jobs will be eliminated as a result of the move, McGillion said.

   H&amp;R Block Inc. said Tuesday it prepared
14 million tax returns in its fiscal year ended April 30, a 7.1
percent rise over the previous year.
   H&amp;R Block, which won't report 1990 corporate earnings until
June, said the number of returns prepared by its company-owned and
franchised offices worldwide was up from 13.1 million returns in
fiscal 1989.
   The figures do not include refunds prepared elsewhere but
brought to H&amp;R Block to be filed with the IRS electronically.
   A total of 2.9 million returns were filed electronically under
the company's Rapid Refund program, up from 825,279 the previous
fiscal year.
   Rapid Refund was in operation in virtually all U.S. offices
during the 1990 tax filing season, compared to only one-third of
company-owned and two-thirds of franchised offices during the 1989
tax filing season, H&amp;R Block said.

   Stock prices jumped Tuesday in the final minutes
of trading as the market cheered the outcome of the first phase of
a record-sized auction of government debt securities.
   The gain extended the market's winning streak to seven trading
days in a row, its longest unbroken rally since last July.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 11.94 to
2,733.56.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by about 5 to 4 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
813 up, 650 down and 518 unchanged.
   The Treasury's quarterly refunding auction consists of $30.5
billion in notes and bonds sold over three days. At the first part
of the auction Tuesday, the government sold $10.5 billion worth of
three-year notes at an average yield of 8.74 percent.
   The sale was considered a success, said Dudley Eppel, managing
director of equity trading at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
Securities Corp. Some market watchers had feared the interest rate
on the notes would go even higher to attract buyers; higher
interest rates tend to depress stock prices.
   But results of the auction weren't released until a few minutes
before the market closed, keeping stock prices in a narrow range
most of the day.
   The Dow average was up 1.13 points on the day as of 3:45 p.m.
EDT. But minutes later the auction results were released, sending
prices climbing. By the closing bell at 4 p.m., the Dow had shot up
more than 10 points, ending 11.94 higher for the day.
   Eppel said the market's real concern over the refunding auction
will come Thursday, when the Treasury plans to sell $10 billion of
30-year bonds. These bonds are considered a bellwether for
long-term interest rates. In between, on Wednesday, the agency will
sell $10 billion of 10-year notes.
   ``We still have another couple of days,'' Eppel said. ``But it
looks like so far, so good.''
   Among most-active blue-chip stocks, IBM rose \ to 110} and
Philip Morris rose \ to 43|. Among other blue chips, American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph was up \ to 40|, General Motors rose { to 46}
and Union Carbide gained &rsqb; to 19~.
   CalFed led the list of most-active NYSE stocks, rising &lsqb; to 17&rsqb;
as 2.5 million shares changed hands. The thrift's shares go
ex-dividend Wednesday, and the trades Tuesday were designed to
capture the payout.
   American General, the second-most-active NYSE issue, rose 1{ to
50{. The Dow Jones Professional Investor Report said Nippon Life
Insurance and Chubb might bid for the insurance company, which has
put itself up for sale. American General said it has had no talks
with either company but otherwise declined comment.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 144.23 million
shares, up from 132.76 million Monday.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 172.95 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000

percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose

<HEAD>Forecasts of Rain Push Cocoa Futures Lower</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cocoa futures prices declined sharply Tuesday on New York's
Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange as rain forecasts improved crop
prospects in Africa and South America.
   On other markets, frozen orange juice futures surged, livestock
and pork futures declined, grain and soybean prices retreated,
energy futures were mixed, and precious metals declined.
   Cocoa futures settled $55 to $68 lower with the contract for
delivery in May at $1,215 a ton.
   Judith Ganes, an analyst with Merril Lynch &amp; Co. in New York,
said cocoa prices in recent weeks had been supported by reports of
dry weather in West Africa and Brazil.
   Weather forecasts call for the end of the dry pattern and the
start of a rainy period.
   Contributing to the drop in cocoa prices was the triggering of
sell stops as futures broke through the $1,250-a-ton support level.
   Frozen orange juice prices surged on New York's Cotton Exchange
as the market reacted to continued tight supplies.
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture crop report due out Thursday
is expected to increase the orange juice crop estimate, Ganes said.
   She said the estimate could be revised upward by 2 million to 3
million boxes, but the increase will not make much difference in
the supply and demand balance.
   Frozen orange juice was 2.5 cents to 4.6 cents higher with May
at $1.968 a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures prices were lower on the Chicago Board
of Trade as traders sold to take profits despite reports the Soviet
Union was in the market for a major wheat purchase.
   At the opening, wheat prices gained support from reports the
Soviets bid for 550,000 metric tons of wheat under the export bonus
program.
   But technical selling set in with the lack of follow-through
buying by traders.
   Corn was performing well through most of the day as the market
reacted to Monday's announcement that the Soviets purchased 1.75
million metric tons of corn, but sold off towards the end of
trading.
   William Biedermann, an analyst with Allendale Inc., said many
traders concluded there will be no further purchases by the
Soviets. But after the close of trading, the USDA announced it has
raised the amount of grain the Soviets can purchase in 1989-1990 to
22 million metric tons from 20 million metric tons.
   Soybean prices drifted lower due to low buyer interest at
current prices, Biedermann said.
   Wheat was 3} cents to 6{ cents lower with May at $3.78 a bushel;
corn was unchanged to 1} cents lower with May at $2.89 a bushel;
oats were 1\ cents to 2 cents lower with May at $1.66 a bushel;
soybeans were 4\ cents lower to a { cent higher with May at $6.33{
a bushel.
   Precious metals prices declined on New York's Commodity Exchange
as the Soviets and other countries sold gold and other metals to
finance their grain purchases, said Richard Levine, an analyst with
Elders Futures Inc. in New York.
   Gold was $1.90 to $2 lower with May at $370 a troy ounce; silver
was 2.7 cents to 3 cents lwoer with May at $4.989 a troy ounce.
   Livestock and pork futures dropped sharply on the Chicago

   Oil prices rose Tuesday, strengthened by
European demand and fears of supply disruptions from a Gulf of
Mexico pipeline shutdown, but traders said a late bout of selling
left the market only slightly higher.
   ``We basically finished not far from where we started,'' said
James R. Fiedler, an energy futures broker at E.D.&amp;F. Man
International Futures Inc. in New York.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the June-delivery price of
West Texas Intermediate, a key grade of high-quality crude, rose 1
cent per barrel to $18.28, after trading as high as $18.58 earlier
in the day. Later-month contracts, however, were mostly lower.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, June-delivery
wholesale home-heating oil rose .9 cent a gallon to 51.34 cents.
Later-month contracts were mixed.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for June delivery rose .62 cent a
gallon to 62.48 cents, and later month prices strengthened as well.
   Natural gas for June delivery strengthened to $1.583 per 1,000
cubic feet, vs. $1.580 Monday. Subsequent month contracts were
little changed to slightly higher.
   Energy futures brokers said the main influences in the market
were pent-up demand in Europe, where the London market was closed
Monday as part of a three-day holiday.
   They also said an apparently broken pipeline in the Gulf of
Mexico, which serves 36 six drilling platforms and handles 95,000
barrels a day, might cause supply disruptions to refineries just as
they are preparing to process large quantities of crude for the
summer driving season.
   Texaco Inc., which runs the Eugene Island pipeline system, said
Tuesday that bad weather had prevented divers from determining the
exact cause of the problem. The pipeline was shut down on Monday.

<HEAD>Mexico Plans To Cut Oil Exports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico is considering a cut in oil exports in
order to take care of domestic industrial needs, the government
said in a five-year energy plan.
   The cut in exports would be to 1 million barrels a day from a
current 1.23 million barrels. Almost all of the exported oil would
go to the United States, Japan and Spain, the plan by the Secretary
of Energy, Mines and Industry said.
   The report said production levels likely will remain at the
current level of about 2.5 million barrels a day through 1994.
   The static production along with domestic needs for refined
petroleum and the existing refining capacity means ``the volume of
crude destined for export necessarily will see a gradual drop,''
the report said.
   The plan, released last week, calls for a more efficient use of
energy and increased energy prices within Mexico. It said Mexico
would save its resources and put money it might have spent on the
oil infrastructure into other areas.
   Mexico said oil prices were not expected to increase
significantly soon and likely would not reach record levels set in
1980-81 before the end of the century.
   Mexico, which is not a member of the 13-nation Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, gets 33 percent of its export
revenue from oil and lists itself as sixth in the world in oil
production.

<HEAD>Columbia Execs Got $4 Million in Bonuses as Thrift Lost $590

   Columbia Savings &amp; Loan
Association's top executives got $4 million in bonuses in 1989,
even as the S&amp;L's vast junk bond holdings led to a $591.1 million
loss for the year.
   The thrift's proxy statement, mailed Monday in advance of the
company's June 5 annual meeting, shows that 17 current or former
Columbia executives received a total $9.5 million in compensation
last year, including the bonuses.
   The statement also shows that government regulators were so
unhappy with the extraordinarily high pay of former Columbia chief
Thomas Spiegel that they forced him to return or forgo at least
$1.1 million in compensation.
   Columbia said Friday it lost $293.3 million during its first
quarter due to continued losses on its $3 billion portfolio of junk
bonds, the biggest collection of the high-yield, high-risk
securities assembled by any S&amp;L.
   Spiegel, who stepped down as chairman and chief executive at the
end of last year, is trying to find a buyer for the bonds. Spiegel
was a close associate of convicted Drexel Burnham Lambert financier
Michael Milken, whose network of junk bond buyers included many
thrifts.
   Spiegel, a former Wall Street bond trader whose father founded
Columbia, once was the highest paid thrift executive, earning $9
million in cash and bonuses in 1985. He earned $898,922 in salary
and other compensation last year.
   In November 1989, under pressure from federal regulators, he
repaid $600,000 he received as part of a $4.1 million pay package
in 1988, the proxy showed.
   The proxy also reveals that Spiegel was to have received
$500,000 per year in return for his efforts to sell the junk bond
portfolio, which were announced when he stepped down at the end of
1989.
   Due to objections from the Office of Thrift Supervision,
however, that amount was reduced to a nominal $1 per year, the
proxy shows. Spiegel continues to receive a benefits package and an
administrative budget of $17,400 per month to cover an office, an
assistant, a secretary and other costs.
   Columbia, once one of the nation's strongest thrifts, now has a
negative net worth of $215.6 million and is in danger of being
seized by federal regulators.
   It is $338.3 million short of the capital it is required to
maintain under the standards adopted last year when the government
bailed out the federal insurance fund for thrifts.
   Besides Spiegel, many of the other executives who received large
1989 bonuses have since left the company.
   The largest amount went to Christopher S. Moore, an executive
vice president in corporate finance who received $1.35 million in
1989, including a $1.15 million bonus. He resigned two months ago.
   Lawrence K. Fish, who resigned as president in August, received
$1.32 million in compensation last year, including a $820,000
payment when he left.
   Edward G. Harshfield, hired to replace Spiegel, is guaranteed a
$500,000 yearly salary but has performance-linked bonus provisions
in his contract that could bring his total pay to as much as $3
million.
   Harshfield also is permitted to continue as a general partner of
a Merrill Lynch-sponsored investment fund he had headed before
joining Columbia in March. The fund was established to bail out
struggling savings and loans. It had hoped to raise $100 million,
but managed to find investors willing to put up only about $30
million.

   USX Corp. said Tuesday it will sell $193
million worth of oil and gas wells to two companies.
   The exploration division of Sonat Inc. will purchase $140
million worth of wells and other facilities from USX, said Thomas
Barker, finance vice president for Birmingham, Ala.-based Sonat.
Most of the assets are in Arkansas, he said.
   Atlantic Richfield Co. will buy 175 working natural gas wells in
southwestern Oklahoma, said Earl Sims, a spokesman for Atlantic
Richfield's energy division. Atlantic Richfield said the wells
produce 14 million cubic feet of natural gas daily.
   Sims wouldn't disclose what Atlantic Richfield would pay for the
wells, but the difference between USX's total sale price and what
Sonat said it would pay is $53 million.
   Officials at both Sonat and Atlantic Richfield said they would
not operate the USX properties as joint ventures.
   Pittsburgh-based USX said it expects to complete the sale in
from two to three months.
   Texas Oil &amp; Gas Co., the USX division that owns the properties,
accounted for about 5.5 percent of the company's 1989 sales.
   USX's sale announcement comes a day after shareholders voted on
New York financier Carl C. Icahn's proposed splitting of the
corporation's steel division and energy holdings, including Texas
Oil &amp; Gas.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The son of a Washington real estate magnate
was accused Tuesday of illegally passing confidential information
about one of his father's deals to a friend who allegedly traded on
the inside information.
   In a civil complaint filed at federal court in Chicago, the
Securities and Exchange Commission accused B. Francis Saul III of
violating the Insider Trading Act of 1984. The SEC also charged
Saul's friend, Peter David Garvy.
   Both men are 28 and Chicago residents.
   In 1988, the SEC alleged, Saul, son of B. Francis Saul II of
Chevy Chase, Md., told Garvy, a former school roomate, about a
proposed tender offer one his father's companies, Westminster
Investing Corp., had made for another Saul concern, the B.F. Saul
Real Estate Investment Trust.
   According to the complaint, Garvy bought 5,500 shares in the
investment trust before the tender offer was made public.
   The complaint also charged that Garvy told his father, Eugene,
70, of Hinsdale, Ill., and a friend, Betsy Perk, 29, of Chicago,
about the pending deal and they purchased shares in the Saul trust.
   The complaint does not accuse the elder Saul, Garvy's father or
Ms. Perk of any wrongdoing.
   ``This kid is totally innocent. He's taken a lie detector test
and passed it 100 percent,'' said Saul's attorney, George Rogers.
``We intend to fight it immediately as soon as we can get to trial
and we expect to win.''
   Rogers said he was surprised the SEC was bringing the case
despite a federal appeals court decision in New York last week that
overturned an insider trading case in which a broker received
merger information from a client whose family owned the company in
question.
   ``Sometimes people have to be told twice. No one's ever accused
the government of being smart,'' said Robert Stephenson, Garvy's
attorney in Chicago, adding that his client also denied the charges
and would seek a quick trial.
   The SEC charged that Garvy, his father and Ms. Perk made a total
of $61,000 in profits using the information supplied by the younger
Saul.
   The SEC is seeking from both Garvy and the younger Saul, who was
not accused of trading for himself, a total of three times the
total illegal profits, or $183,000, in penalties.

   The Bush administration said Tuesday it will
introduce legislation this week stripping the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission of control over stock-index futures.
   The announcement marks a victory for the Securities and Exchange
Commission, which regulates the nation's stock markets, in a turf
battle with the rival CFTC, which oversees U.S. futures markets.
   Treasury Undersecretary Robert Glauber told a Senate panel the
administration wants the SEC to have authority over all
stock-related financial products, including stock-index futures and
stock-index options.
   The committee chairman, Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., after
complaining that the proposal would further delay futures market
reform legislation, said he would ask Senate leaders to bring it to
the floor for action.
   In Chicago, Thomas R. Donovan, chairman of the Chicago Board of
Trade, complained that the proposal ``would solve a perceived
problem only to create a very real one by placing futures markets
under two regulators.''
   Such a transfer of authority ``is clearly just the first step of
creeping regulatory imperialism,'' he added in a lengthy statement
released by the CBOT.
   Glauber said the administration believes that one market
regulator should control all aspects of the financial community,
but that creating a new agency or merging the SEC and CFTC could
take too much time.
   ``Instead, the administration supports a less sweeping approach
that would only unify regulation of the `one market' of stocks,
stock options and stock-index futures under the SEC,'' he said.
   Glauber described the SEC as ``the agency with the greatest
expertise in the combination of these products.''
   While the CFTC and SEC ``are doing a good job under difficult
circumstances,'' Glauber said the answer to the jurisdictional
dispute was to simplify ``regulatory fragmentation.''
   The administration plan also calls for giving the SEC control of
setting margins, the down payment investors must make when buying
stocks or futures contracts on credit.
   Glauber announced the administration plan in testimony before
the Senate Agriculture Committee, which oversees the CFTC.
   The dispute centers on which agency should oversee financial
products that have elements of both a security and a futures
contract. These so-called hybrid products include stock-index
futures.
   Leahy complained the dispute has held up passage of a bill that
adds several market reform measures to the CFTC's reauthorization.
   ``Congress remains blocked from enacting the tough reforms we
all agreed are needed,'' he said. Leahy also said the committee
``should consider responsible, appropriate solutions _ possibly
even the ultimate merger of the SEC and CFTC if this is shown to be
justified and feasible.''
   John Damgard, president of the Futures Industry Association, who
sat in on the hearing, said: ``There'll be no jurisdictional change
this year. But it sure mucks up the reauthorization scene, which I
think everybody will agree is unfortunate.''
   The Senate hearing began as the first trial stemming from a
massive fraud investigation into the Chicago futures exchanges got
under way with jury selection Tuesday.
   Last year, 47 traders and one clerk were indicted on various
fraud charges following an FBI undercover probe at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade, the world's two
largest futures exchanges.
   In the wake of that scandal, the CFTC was criticized roundly by
several members of the Senate Agriculture Committee last fall for
being too lax a watchdog.
   The committee was scheduled to hear from representatives of the
four agencies of the White House Working Group on Financial
Markets, which was set up in the wake of the 1987 stock market
crash to handle intermarket issues.
   In addition to the Treasury's Glauber, other witnesses
testifying were Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, SEC
Chairman Richard Breeden and CFTC Chairman Wendy Gramm.
   The four already have aired their views before congressional
panels and in numerous speeches and interviews. Breeden and Glauber
are on one side, Gramm on the other with Greenspan somewhere in
between.
   Breeden and Glauber have said the SEC should be given control of
stock-index futures, which now are controlled by the futures
exchanges with CFTC oversight. The products allow investors to
speculate on the stock market without buying the underlying stocks.
   Gramm has said the attempt to grab CFTC authority over
stock-index futures is driven by ``jealousy'' on Wall Street and
``regulatory imperialism'' at the SEC.
   Previously Greenspan has said he is ``slightly in favor'' of
giving the SEC control of stock index futures. But he is against
merging the SEC and CFTC, which was proposed in legislation
introduced in the House last month.

   A jury on Tuesday said the Dallas Times Herald
was not harmed unfairly by the loss of 26 comics and features last
fall to its larger rival, The Dallas Morning News.
   The jury voted 10-2 in declining to award damages to the Times
Herald, which contended that the Morning News and its parent, A.H.
Belo Corp., violated anti-trust laws by taking over the features in
a move to drive the Times Herald out of business.
   The Times Herald had asked for $33 million in actual damages and
what its attorneys termed significant punitive damages. The $33
million, under Texas antitrust and conspiracy laws, would have been
tripled if the Times Herald lawsuit had been successful.
   ``We feel strongly we have been vindicated,'' said Robert
Decherd, Belo chairman. ``The law and the facts of this case have
been with us all along. We never doubted the outcome. If you apply
the law to this case, there was no case.''
   Times Herald Publisher John Buzzetta said, ``I'm disappointed,''
then hurriedly left the courtroom with his attorneys.
   ``We'll keep on fighting,'' said Times Herald attorney Wayne
Fisher.
   The Times Herald released a statement later saying, ``We
disagree that the conduct of our competitor was legal or proper in
any way. In fact, it was wrong in many ways _ wrong morally, wrong
ethically, wrong for the profession of journalism and wrong for
Dallas and its people.''
   The lawsuit challenged a Belo joint venture with Universal Press
Syndicate that stripped the Times Herald of features including
Doonesbury, Dear Abby, The Far Side and Erma Bombeck.
   Jurors deliberated five days before reaching the verdict Tuesday
afternoon. The jurors were asked: ``Did A.H. Belo Corp. or The
Dallas Morning News Co. willfully attempt to achieve monopoly power
in a relevant market or markets?''
   Jurors earlier asked about the definition of ``willfully'' and
whether the relevant market in the case was the newspapers or the
features.
   State District Judge David West accepted a response proposed by
Belo and Morning News attorneys and over the objections of Times
Herald lawyers.
   The Times Herald had contended the features transfer violated
antitrust laws, was intended to strengthen Belo and Morning News
market dominance in Dallas and drive the Times Herald out of
business.
   The suit also alleged that Morning News and Belo officials
conspired to get the features and interfered in the Times Herald's
contract with Kansas City-based Universal Press Syndicate.
   Belo and The Morning News defended the deal as a good business
decision. It will use syndicate comics characters in television
programs and commercials to encourage newspper readership.
   A syndicate requirement of the venture mandated that all
Universal Press features in the Times Herald be moved to The
Morning News.
   The Times Herald said the five-year deal and The Morning News'
right of first refusal for any new syndicate features amounted to a
restraint of trade.
   The Times Herald estimated the features loss cost it a permanent
circulation drop of 10,800, which their experts calculated was
worth the $33 million.
   Morning News attorneys repeatedly referred to circulation
figures that showed the Times Herald is in better shape now than it
was before the features were moved.
   Times Herald officials, however, testified that in order to stop
the circulation slide, they began a $1 million reader lottery
promotion to boost circulation. Times Herald witnesses termed the
lottery a short-term and temporary solution.
   The Morning News' daily circulation was an estimated 355,000 and
the Times Herald's 225,000, according to the 1989 Editor &amp;
Publisher Yearbook.

   International Monetary Fund officials approved
a record $60 billion increase in resources Tuesday to meet growing
demands for assistance from emerging democracies in Eastern Europe
and debt-strapped nations in Latin America.
   The authorization from the IMF's policy-setting interim
committee came after the panel adopted a U.S.-backed proposal to
crack down on countries that are delinquent in repaying their IMF
loans.
   The 50 percent increase, which still must be approved by the
voting membership of the 152-nation fund, would boost IMF lending
resources to $180 billion.
   Third World countries had fought to double IMF resources,
contending $240 billion is needed to ensure that economic
assistance to Eastern Europe does not crowd out support for Latin
America and Africa.
   B.T.G. Chidzero, finance minister for Zimbabwe, said greater
support from the IMF and its sister lending organization, the World
Bank, was critical to avert ``falling into a crisis of
international development finance in the present decade.''
   On another matter, the finance officials stopped short of
endorsing a proposal to create an environmental fund in the World
Bank to supply $1.3 billion in low-interest loans over three years.
   The money would be used to address cross-border environmental
problems such as global warming, the growth of deserts, river
system pollution and destruction of the ozone layer.
   France is backing the new fund, but the United States and
several other countries are opposed.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, in remarks prepared for
Tuesday's closed-door sessions of the Development Committee, called
the environmental issue ``of great importance'' to the United
States. But he said approval of the new fund should be delayed
until questions concerning current World Bank environmental
programs were addressed.
   In a statement, the Development Committee said that it had
agreed that ``further work was necessary'' on the proposal and that
in the meantime the World Bank should ``take steps to reinforce its
existing environmental programs.''
   French Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy had pleaded with other
countries to approve the program now and warned, ``time is
passing.''
   Bargaining over the increase in IMF resources at times became
intense, according to participants in the meetings. Arguing for the
U.S. position, Brady noted the administration must win suport for
the proposal from a Democratic-controlled Congress.
   Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson, head of the interim
committee, said that to get the final agreement, ``each country had
to put a little water in its wine'' and accept compromises.
   The United States, which had wanted to delay the next round of
funding negotiations until 1995, agreed to a 1993 date. In return,
the United States achieved a key demand for tougher procedures for
poor countries that owe $4 billion in back payments to the IMF.
   Delinquent countries who adopt economic reforms would be
eligible for money from a special IMF fund. However, nations behind
in their payments could lose their voting rights. Also, the agency
could sell gold roughly equivalent to the members' original
contributions to meet the obligations of defaulting debtors.
   The 11 nations behind in their payments are the Sudan, Zambia,
Peru, Costa Rica, Honduras, Guyana, Somalia, Sierra Leone,
Cambodia, Vietnam and Panama.
   The IMF increase was also tied up with a diplomatic question of
the rankings of the biggest economic powers in the fund. The
rankings govern how much voting power the nations have.
   America's No. 1 ranking and voting strength was left unchanged
at 19 percent. However, Japan vaulted from No. 5 to No. 2, tied
with West Germany. Britain, previously ranked No. 2, dropped into a
tie for fourth place with France.
   On another matter, Polish Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz
told reporters he had held discussions during the two-day meetings
on Poland's efforts to reduce its $41 billion foreign debt.
   Balcerowicz reported progress in negotiations with commercial
banks using debt-reduction guidelines called for by Brady. But he
indicated less success in the effort to cut Poland's debt owed to
other governments.
   Reducing the debt burden is critical for Poland to keep
political support for its crash program to replace four decades of
communism with a free-market economy, he said.
