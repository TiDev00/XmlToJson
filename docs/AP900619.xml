   She rose out of the sea at midnight
and carefully dug a nest in the sand as her ancestors have done for
about 90 million years.
   Only this time, the giant loggerhead sea turtle had an audience.
   Two-dozen flash-popping, oohing-and-aahing beachgoers encircled
the 200-pound turtle and watched transfixed as she slowly deposited
more than 100 eggs the size of ping-pong balls into a hole in the
sand, covered them and lumbered back into the surf, never to see
them again.
   ``It's almost a religious experience. Maybe it's a female thing,
but I empathize with the turtle. All that multiple labor,'' said
Sue Sheehan, 44, a teacher from nearby Jupiter who brought her
mother from Phoenix to see turtles give birth behind the Jupiter
Beach Hilton.
   The women were among thousands of locals and tourists taking
part in turtle watches on Florida's East Coast last week during the
peak of the May-September nesting season.
   Biologists credit the late-night watches with raising awareness
and aiding research about the endangered sea turtles, which seem to
face threats from every corner.
   But the watches also have raised concerns among some biologists
who want to minimize human impact on the skittish turtles and
prevent the excesses of ``swim with the dolphin'' programs and
parks where bears accept handouts from tourists.
   ``You have to be careful when we interfere with nature. Are we
really doing the best thing, or causing more harm?'' asked Maj.
Roger Bennett of the Florida Marine Patrol.
   While scientists aren't sure how many sea turtles remain,
loggerheads are classified as a threatened species, and
leatherback, green and Kemp's Ridley turtles are on the endangered
list.
   Adult turtles can live about 75 years in the wild, and each
female digs up to seven nests a year. The incubation period is
about 60 days. Right after hatching, baby turtles head for the
ocean.
   Pollution, beach traffic, poachers, storms and natural predators
prevent all but one or two of every 100 eggs from surviving the 15
years to maturity, says Marc Lavasseur, a marine researcher
licensed by the state and paid by the Hilton to give lectures and
protect the eggs on the beach next to the hotel.
   Several nights each week, Lavasseur patrols the area. If
leatherback, green or Kemp's Ridley turtles reach the beach, he
keeps everyone away. But when a more common loggerhead begins to
lay eggs, he ushers the crowds in for a look at the primordial
ritual.
   ``I love stuff like this!'' said Mary Lynn Fischer, who brought
her husband and two children along from Naperville, Ill.
   ``With Earth Day and recycling, the consciousness is just
there,'' said Mrs. Fischer. ``All of our friends are going to
Yosemite and Yellowstone. They're not doing the cruises any more.''
   Lavasseur says the odd-looking animals need human help.
   When Miami Beach was just a sand bar and Palm Beach only a
dream, sea turtles nested all along Florida's shores, returning
each year to the same spot to lay their eggs. But now that
condominiums and hotels loom over much of the coast, private
landowners in particular should make the beaches as hospitable as
possible, Lavasseur says.
   ``Man never should have built on the barrier islands,'' he said.
``Now that we have, it's our responsibility to help mitigate the
problems we've put in.''
   The 29-year-old former hotel bellhop has persuaded managers to
dim the lights during the nesting season so that pregnant turtles
and hatchlings won't mistake them for moonlight and become
disoriented. He also relocates nests laid in front of the hotel's
boardwalk to safer areas.
   The ultimate effects of his efforts are unclear, but state
Department of Natural Resources statistics show 931 nests were laid
last year on the }-mile beach Lavasseur patrols. Already this year,
he's documented 235 nests, an indication that nesting is on the
increase.
   Still, state officials are keeping close tabs on the turtle
watches to be sure they don't become too much of a good thing.
   ``We certainly would never permit every area of the beach to
watch turtles every night,'' said Barbara Schroeder, who
coordinates sea turtle programs for the department. ``We have to
weigh the educational benefit against harrassment to the turtles.''

<HEAD>Bake Sales, Bottle Drives Raise Money for Site for Town Offices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY HARKAVY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOOTHBAY, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When a municipal office building goes up
across the road from the town common, it will be a monument to the
drawing power of bake sales, bottle drives and Fourth of July
chicken barbecues.
   Along with car and quilt raffles, turkey suppers, lobster bakes,
fall foliage festivals, boat trips and dinner theaters. Not to
mention a Hawaiian pig roast, a jazz concert and a white elephant
sale.
   Plus letters and door-to-door solicitations that brought in
contributions from 648 people.
   Instead of having taxpayers shell out an average of $15 for each
of the next 20 years, a civic group has staged dozens of
fund-raisers to come up with the $250,000 to buy a site for the
building and then donate it to the town.
   ``It's like a dream,'' said Henry Rowe, one of the founders of
the Boothbay Civic Association and its president. Now only $40,000
away from its goal, the nonprofit association expects to complete
its campaign this fall.
   ``The level of commitment is amazing,'' said Town Manager
Victoria Dyer.
   The association formed after the town initially decided to build
the new town offices, now situated up a steep flight of stairs over
the town garage, at a ball field half a mile down a side road.
   Association members decided to buy the property in the center of
town that now holds an abandoned garage, and turn what many
consider an eyesore into a landmark.
   The central location is at a crossroads, the gateway to Boothbay
Harbor and other villages along a scenic peninsula where thousands
of visitors stream in and out on summer days.
   The association answered protests the site would be too costly
by raising the money on its own. The town will pay for construction
of the building.
   ``I think that every community in the country ought to have a
civic association to do what's right, away from the tax dollar,''
said former boat builder Chetley Rittall, regarded as the moving
spirit behind the project.
   Rittall and his followers organized the association in 1987,
with the first $100 coming from a supper put on by the fire
department. Within months the group had raised $50,000, enough to
secure a $200,000 mortgage on the garage.
   Fishermen donated 1,250 pounds of lobsters for two lobster
bakes. At times, 100 women were enlisted to turn out pies for bake
sales.
   The project has not been without hitches. Association leaders
felt badly served when the town of 3,500 year-round residents sent
a bill for $2,500 for taxes on the garage property despite the
group's nonprofit status.
   Although the association plans to appeal the assessment, its
leaders are amused at the irony.
   ``If we don't pay the taxes, the town will have a lien on the
property, but we're going to be donating it to the town anyway,''
Rowe said.

<HEAD>Engineer Named MIT's 15th President</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Charles Vest, provost of the University
of Michigan, has been named president of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, a post he called ``one of the greatest
bully pulpits'' in science.
   The 48-year-old mechanical engineer was elected unanimously
Monday by the MIT Corporation, the school's governing body.
   The selection of the school's 15th president ends a trying,
year-long effort to replace the retiring Paul Gray in which three
leading candidates withdrew.
   Vest will be leaving a state-supported university with 50,000
students on three campuses for a private research institution with
9,700 students. MIT, founded in 1861, has long ranked among the
world's finest universities.
   ``The presidency of MIT is one of the greatest bully pulpits for
science and technology in the United States and I will make use of
it,'' Vest said Monday
   In a statement, Vest said, ``MIT will lead in the redefinition
of engineering education in light of scientific change, and the new
global and social realities.''
   Vest said the training of engineers needs to be expanded to
include more exposure to the humanities and other areas.
   MIT has long performed research for the Pentagon, and Vest said
he expects that to continue. But as defense needs diminish, Vest
said he hopes more researchers can devote themselves to fields such
as manufacturing, health and biotechnology.
   The choice of the soft-spoken Vest was praised at MIT and at Ann
Arbor, where Vest arrived from his native West Virginia as a
graduate student in 1963 and went on to become dean of engineering
and, in 1989, provost.
   ``MIT made the right choice,'' said James Duderstadt, president
of the University of Michigan.
   Vest has ``extraordinary vision and depth'' and ``that rare
ability to get people to do things by believing they want to do
them,'' Duderstadt said.
   Gray said in March 1989 that he intended to step down next month
after 10 years and become MIT Corporation chairman.
   The front-runner for president, MIT Provost David Deutch,
withdrew after his nomination drew strong opposition from some
faculty.
   Nobel laureate and MIT biologist David Baltimore was viewed as
the probable best alternative to Deutch. But he took a job as
president of Rockefeller University.
   In February, MIT professor Phillip Sharp said he would take the
job, but before the MIT Corporation had a chance to vote on him, he
had a change of heart. Sharp said he preferred to continue his
cancer research and teaching.

<HEAD>University Official, Driver Murdered In Peruvian Andes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HUANCAYO, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The vice rector of Huancayo University, a
Marxist who taught philosophy and literature, was murdered along
with his driver and their bodies were found 10 days after they were
abducted, family members say.
   The bodies of Jaime Cerron and Armando Tapia were found Monday
by farmers in a ravine outside this Andean city 120 miles east of
Lima, according to Cerron's widow, Bertha.
   She said both men had their hands tied and were shot in the
head, and that the hands and feet of Cerron showed signs of torture.
   Cerron and Tapia were kidnapped 10 days ago by six heavily-armed
men who stopped the pickup truck in which the two were travelling.
   Witnesses said the kidnappers may have been soldiers dressed in
civilian clothes. Military officials would not comment on the case.
   Cerron had been arrested six months ago for supposed contacts
with Maoist Shining Path guerrillas, Mrs Cerron said. He was soon
released, she said.
   More than 18,500 people have died in political violence since
the Shining Path took up arms 10 years ago.

<HEAD>Beijing To Evict 102,000 Migrants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beijing will evict 102,000 migrant workers in the
coming months as part of a drive to spruce up its image before it
hosts the Asian Games in September, an official newspaper reported
today.
   The China Daily said only those migrants with special
certificates would be allowed to stay in the capital.
   The newspaper said thorough checks will be made of workplaces
hiring rural labor and those employing unregistered laborers will
be fined.
   The report said the sweep against migrant workers would keep
urban unemployment down and ensure a clean and secure environment
for the Asian Games.
   An estimated 100,000 foreign athletes, sports officials and
tourists are expected in the capital for the games. They will be
the largest international sports event ever staged in China.
   Chinese authorities, trying to improve the nation's image after
the bloody military crackdown on the pro-democracy movement last
year, are intent on making sure the games go off without a hitch.
   In 1987, more than 1 million rural workers flooded Beijing, a
city of 10 million, to work in the construction and service
industries and take manual labor jobs unpopular with city residents.
   The peasant workers, shoddily dressed and carrying all their
belongings on their back, camped out at the overcrowded railway
station and set up makeshift stalls on city streets.
   Chinese are legally allowed to live and work only in places
where they are officially registered with the government.
Authorities previously did little to stop the migrants because they
provided a needed source of unskilled labor.
   The demand for the unskilled workers declined sharply in late
1988 after the government introduced an austerity program that
brought an abrupt end to the construction boom.
   Last year, Beijing asked 284,000 migrant workers to leave the
capital, the China Daily said. It quoted city officials as saying
the desirable number of rural farmers allowed to work in Beijing
should be no more than 350,000.

   1990 is fast becoming one of the worst
years on record for tornadoes and flooding across the middle and
southern sections of the nation.
   So far this year, 726 tornadoes have touched down nationwide,
well ahead of the 640 tornadoes recorded during the first six
months of last year, and the 30-year average of 482 tornadoes
recorded between January and July, said Frederick Ostby of the
National Severe Storms Forecast Center here.
   The nation had 747 tornadoes in the first six months of 1973 _
one of the biggest years for tornadoes since 1950, when the
forecast center began keeping reliable records of the storms. There
were 756 tornadoes reported in 1982.
   ``We seem to be on a pace that would put us up with those two
years,'' Ostby said.
   The culprit in this tornado barrage across the Plains is a
persistent West Coast pattern of low pressure in the upper
atmosphere that is keeping the jet stream anchored at a southern
latitude.
   This year's storms seem particularly violent, as illustrated by
the March 13 tornado that cut a swath a mile wide and brought winds
of 300 mph to a field in Kansas. The tornado was the strongest to
hit the United States since 1985.
   The first weekend in June saw the worst outburst of tornadoes
since 1974. Ostby said 101 tornadoes touched down from Kansas to
Kentucky, leaving nine people dead.
   But a break in the storm pattern may be at hand.
   As summer wears on, the land warms up and cold air from Canada
retreats. This moves the boundary of the jet stream to the north,
Ostby said.
   ``Our longer range computer forecasts are suggestive of that.
There is some kind of a readjustment beginning to take place in the
upper atmosphere,'' he said.
   However, a study of tornado trends indicates parts of the
Midwest, particularly Kansas and Missouri, are heading into a
six-year period of more intense tornadoes.
   The study of tornadoes since early this century shows that they
are concentrated in regions for five- or six-year periods, said
Michael Smith, president of WeatherData Inc.
   But warning of impending storms is becoming more sophisticated,
leading to fewer deaths. Tornadoes have caused 20 deaths this year,
while an average year in the 1980s saw 52 deaths, and in the 1970s
nearly 100, Ostby said.
   ``There are better watches, better warnings and a better
response,'' Ostby said.
   Ostby credited the quicker response to computers that allow
meteorologists to see many sources of data, such as satellite
readings, more clearly.
   Flooding in the South and the Plains has been as destructive as
the tornadoes.
   The death toll from last week's flash floods in Shadyside, Ohio,
rose to 21 on Monday, making the flood one of the most deadly in
recent years. Authorities held out little hope for more than a
dozen others listed as missing.
   Wegee and Pipe creeks overflowed during storms that dumped 5{
inches of rain in 3{ hours. The floods destroyed as many as 70
houses and damaged up to 40, officials said.
   Flooding in Texas has been blamed for at least 16 deaths since
April. An estimated 10,000 people were forced from their homes, and
high water caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage.

   A helicopter swooped into the
exercise yard of a maximum-security prison early Monday and in a
daring maneuver flew two inmates to freedom.
   Officials said a prison guard was shot in the leg during the
escape at Kent prison, about 50 miles east of Vancouver.
   The prison holds some of the most dangerous criminals in Canada.
Almost half the inmates in the all-male facility are kept in
protective custody and about one-quarter are serving life sentences.
   Dianne Brown, a federal corrections spokeswoman, identified the
two escapees as Robert Ford, 32, and David Thomas, 24.
   She said Ford was serving a life sentence for first-degree
murder while Thomas was serving an eight-year term for robbery.
   Ford and two other men escaped from a prison in Victoria in
March 1989 while awaiting trial. They were captured 11 days later.
   Lori Stevens, who lives across the road from the prison,
witnessed the escape from her living room. ``It was fun to watch.
It looked like a bad movie,'' she said.
   The Bell 206 helicopter and its pilot, Fred Fandrich, had been
hijacked from Valley Helicopters Ltd., said a Transport Canada
official. Fandrich owns the company.
   At about 8:40 a.m. the helicopter touched down inside the
prison's inner fence and a man inside the helicopter opened fired
at Corrections officer Ripley Kirby, hitting him in the leg, police
said.
   Police said two inmates emerged from a nearby workshop, ran to
the helicopter and jumped aboard.
   ``I was told to get out of there, so I got out of there,'' said
Fandrich, 50.
   ``There was a lot of gunfire inside the helicopter from the guy
with the gun and it was very, very loud when he's shooting a foot
away from your head,'' the pilot added.
   The helicopter was then flown to Silver Creek, about 50 miles
north of the prison. Police said Fandrich was tied up and the two
escapees and an accomplice left the area in a bluish-gray car.
   Fandrich managed to escape and contact police.
   The escape was the second since Kent opened in 1979. Assistant
warden Judy Croft said two inmates escaped eight years ago by
hiding in a truck as it left the grounds. They were captured less
than an hour later.
   Dennis Finlay, another federal corrections spokesman, said the
situation at the prison was under control. The prison has 260
inmates.
   A similar attempt failed in February in France when three gunmen
hijacked a helicopter and forced the pilot to fly to a
maximum-security prison south of Paris. The hijackers dropped a
rope from the helicopter, but it snapped as prisoners grabbed it.
One man was killed and another was seriously injured.
   Last August in Colorado, two women in a hijacked helicopter
plucked two men from a prison yard. The escape attempt ended in a
shootout with police 400 miles away.
   A similar prison escape in Miami in April ended when the
helicopter crashed inside the prison yard.

   How does a country count more than 1 billion
people _ especially if many don't want to be counted?
   China has started by drafting nearly 7 million census workers,
more than the entire population of Finland.
   Hundreds of thousands of training centers have been set up to
teach the workers how to conduct the world's biggest head-count,
which begins July 1 and will take about 10 days.
   In addition, millions more Chinese have been mobilized to hang
red banners in the streets, beat drums, sing songs and hand out
publicity materials to popularize the slogan, ``The population
census _ everyone is responsible.''
   Most Chinese have responded with the passive acquiesence they
give all government campaigns, such as those calling for killing
flies or studying socialist labor models.
   But the census, last held in 1982, strikes fear in the hearts of
a substantial minority.
   They are the millions of people who have moved to cities without
permission, and millions of others who have violated
family-planning regulations by having more than one child.
   Fearful of being fined thousands of dollars, parents often fail
to register additional children and try to keep them deep secrets _
hence their nickname ``black children.''
   ``It's very possible that there's a black child in each
(apartment) building,'' said census worker Zhang Yuesi, who was
taking part one recent afternoon in a pre-census trial in northeast
Beijing's Zuo Family Village neighborhood.
   She and five other workers visited three households and filled
out questionnaires as a practice run.
   ``We must deeply arouse the masses and do propaganda work among
them'' in order to get a correct count, said Mrs. Zhang, a brisk
woman who usually works in the municipal Statistics Bureau. Like
other census workers, she was temporarily drafted in March to help
make the count.
   Census officials insist they won't punish anyone for having more
than one child or living illegally in a city.
   At a recent news conference, Zhang Sai, deputy director of the
central government's census ``leading group,'' or committee,
promised that data on individual families won't be shared with
police or family planning officials.
   But it is not the census questionnaire per se that worries some
families.
   It is the prolonged glare of official attention, including
pre-census checks of household registrations _ little booklets that
list household members. One copy is kept at home, and one in the
local police station.
   Since spring, officials already have made door-to-door checks to
confirm registrations are up to date, and have quizzed neighbors
about suspect households. If there were any ``black children'' in
Zuo Family Village, they likely were uncovered during this stage,
when there was no confidentiality.
   Zhang Yuesi, the census worker, didn't want to release figures
for her own turf. But she disclosed that in Fengtai, a rural area
of Beijing, more than 300 unregistered children were found ``in
just one census district.''
   Li Honggui, deputy director of the national census office, said
some have speculated the nationwide total of ``black children''
will reach several tens of millions.
   The last census, in 1982, counted 1.03 billion people, and
registered births and deaths since have produced a tentative count
of 1.112 billion, making China by far the most populous country in
the world.
   India is No. 2 with 880 million people.
   Zhang Sai said an exact figure is needed for the smooth running
of China's planned economy. That's why census-takers are going
door-to-door this year, instead of asking residents to visit census
stations as in the other three counts made during four decades of
Communist rule.
   Computers are playing a bigger role, too, replacing the abacus.
First results will be released in October, and a detailed
tabulation in 1992.
   ``Our standard is to be off by no more than one-thousandth,''
said Zhang Yuesi, who is not related to Zhang Sai.
   Peculiarities of China's housing allocation system have created
pitfalls that will test even the best-prepared counter.
   Take the case of Liu Yugui, a retired union official in Zuo
Family Village's East No. 10 Building. His household registration
book shows five people living in a two-room apartment.
   In reality, his son, daughter and grandson have found unofficial
housing elsewhere. But they often visit and spend the night, Liu
said. Where should they be counted?
   There are other special cases. Families swap assigned
apartments, trying to move closer to work. Grown children marry
outside Beijing but stay registered with their parents, hoping one
day to return to the capital. Double-counting seems as much a risk
as missing heads.
   But most problems can be resolved with a simple rule, Mrs. Zhang
said: people will be counted at their place of registration unless
they've lived somewhere else more than one year.

<HEAD>Bush Prods Shamir on Middle East Peace Process</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is prodding Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir to open a dialogue with Palestinian Arabs
as the first step in reviving long-stalled Middle East peace talks.
   Bush, in a lengthy letter, asked the prime minister what his new
right-wing government was willing to do to promote peace, and
whether he still supports a plan for elections of Palestinian
representatives in the occupied territories, officials said Monday.
   The president's letter, sent in the last few days, adds weight
to a warning by Secretary of State James A. Baker III that the
United States will stop trying to get peace talks under way unless
Shamir makes compromises to open a dialogue with Palestinians.
   Confirming receipt of Bush's letter, Shamir said Bush ``asked me
for replies and explanations about our path in the framework of the
peace process.
   ``Naturally we will reply to him,'' Shamir said in a televised
interview in Jerusalem. ``We will explain to him, to the best of
our ability, our attitude, our proposals, and I sincerely hope if,
here and there, there are differences of opinion, we will reach an
agreement.''
   The White House did not release Bush's letter, but presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said it congratulated Shamir on forming
a new government after a three-month political deadlock.
   ``The president asked him for a description of where he stands
on the peace process at this month,'' Fitzwater said. He said Bush
expressed hopes that Shamir remained committed to the plan he
espoused last year.
   The United States and Israel have been deeply divided over steps
to implement Shamir's plan.
   Last week, Shamir's government set restrictive new conditions on
his proposal, darkening prospects that it ever would be implemented.
   Baker, in an appearance before a House committee last Wednesday,
appeared to question whether the Israeli government was genuinely
committed to the peace process.
   He said officials of Shamir's new government had dismissed the
plan for a Palestinian dialogue and were adding new conditions that
Palestinians must meet as a price for talks.
   ``Now, if that's going to be the approach, and that's going to
be the attitude, there won't be any dialogue and there won't be any
peace and the United States of America can't make it happen,''
Baker said.
   He offered the White House telephone number and said, in a clear
message to Israel, ``When you're serious about peace, call us.''
   In May 1989, Shamir proposed holding elections among Palestinian
Arabs who live on the West Bank and Gaza. These Palestinians would
negotiate with Israel the terms for five years of limited
self-rule, to be followed by a second round of talks on an overall
settlement of the Arab-Israeli dispute.
   Baker concluded last fall that Shamir's plan was the best
approach to getting negotiations started. He consulted over several
months with Egypt, Israel and, through Egyptian intermediaries,
with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   A formula devised by Baker to implement Shamir's proposal called
for talks between Israelis and Palestinians in Cairo. It also
provided for the participation of Palestinians expelled from the
territories and others who had residences in East Jerusalem.
   Shamir, evidently objecting to the provisions on the
Palestinians, refused to submit the plan to the Israeli cabinet for
approval.
   Bush, meanwhile, declared East Jerusalem _ which Shamir has
vowed to retain _ occupied territory.
   The Israeli government collapsed in turmoil in March, and the
U.S. initiative went on hold as Israel struggled to form a new
government.
   David Levy, the foreign minister of Israel's new government,
charged last week that Baker's proposal was out of sync with the
plan outlined last year by Shamir.
   ``The Israeli government peace initiative has been changed and
distorted and turned into questions, the Baker questions, to which
Israel was required to answer `yes' or `no,''' Levy said. ``No
nation can be asked to gamble with its own survival.''

<HEAD>Bush Will Tell Mandela Sanctions Won't Be Lifted Prematurely</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is prepared to assure Nelson
Mandela that he won't push for removal of U.S. sanctions against
South Africa until that country meets all the conditions specified
by Congress, American officials say.
   The black leader is due to arrive in the United States on
Wednesday but won't meet with Bush until next Monday, using the
interim period more for ceremonial activities than for substantive
discussions.
   A ticker-tape parade in New York on Wednesday after a ceremonial
arrival at the airport will launch Mandela's three-day visit to
that city. He also will visit Boston before coming to Washington.
   Although he is philosophically opposed to sanctions, Bush is
expected to promise Mandela that his administration will comply
faithfully with the terms of 1986 legislation for ending the
sanctions, said the U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Other analysts said the president also does not wish to inject
controversy into what are expected to be tumultuous receptions for
the deputy leader of the African National Congress as he makes his
12-day U.S. visit.
   In addition, efforts to undercut Mandela's pro-sanctions message
would have the added effect of setting back Republican efforts to
recruit more blacks to their ranks, the analysts said.
   The sanctions deny U.S. landing rights for South African Airways
and ban importation of certain South African products. Also
prohibited are new U.S. investments and bank loans.
   Democrats on Capitol Hill, who generally are strong supporters
of sanctions, contend that the liberalizing measures thus far
adopted by South African President F. W. de Klerk are largely
cosmetic. They detect signs that some in the administration want to
give a boost to de Klerk by scaling back some sanctions.
   The administration says its policy will be guided by the 1986
sanctions legislation. The president can consider lifting any of
the sanctions if South Africa meets four of five conditions set
forth by Congress.
   However, there may be disagreement between the administration
and Congress over precisely what South Africa must do to be in
compliance.
   No one on either side is claiming that South Africa has met the
congressional requirement that all political prisoners be released.
On that basis, Mandela will receive assurances next week there will
be no relaxation of sanctions, the U.S. officials said.
   But a confrontation over that issue may lie ahead because of
differing estimates over the number of South African prisoners
detained for political reasons. The range is between 350 and 3,500.
   Another ambiguity is the status of the U.S. condition that the
state of emergency in South Africa must be lifted. South Africa
announced an end to emergency rules in three provinces on June 8
but they remain in effect in Natal, which has been plagued by a
wave of black-on-black violence.
   The administration is studying the legal implications of what
this partial step means in terms of South African compliance with
the U.S. conditions. The June 8 action was hailed by the White
House as evidence of the ``remarkable progress'' South Africa has
made under de Klerk's leadership.
   One condition on which there has been no progress is the repeal
of restrictions on the movements of non-whites and on where they
can live.
   But as the administration sees it, South Africa has fulfilled
other U.S. conditions by unbanning black groups that previously had
been proscribed and by showing a willingness to negotiate a new
arrangement for the country's black majority.
   Some in Congress say these actions have fallen short of
congressional intent.

<HEAD>`Dick Tracy' Opens Strong But Faces Big Guns in Coming Weeks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   ``Dick Tracy'' debuted on top with $22.5
million in ticket sales over the weekend, but the crime stopper
soon goes up against enough big guns to make nemesis Big Boy look
like small fry.
   Over the next three weeks, ``Dick Tracy'' clashes with such
potential summer blockbusters as ``RoboCop 2,'' ``Days of Thunder''
and ``Die Hard 2.''
   According to figures released Monday by Exhibitor Relations Co.,
Warren Beatty's ``Dick Tracy'' claimed the biggest opening weekend
ever by a film released by Walt Disney Studios.
   So far, ``Dick Tracy'' has received mostly good reviews and
positive word of mouth. But in this crowded movie season, the film
failed to surpass Arnold Schwarzenegger's ``Total Recall'' for the
season's top opening weekend.
   ``Total Recall,'' opening three weeks ago, grossed $25.5 million
its debut. The ``Dick Tracy'' haul included $1.2 million in
T-shirts that served as tickets at midnight openings. The film is
playing on 2,332 screens in North America.
   The best debut ever was that of another comic-book crime
fighter, ``Batman,'' which collected $40.5 million for Warner Bros.
in its first weekend last summer.
   Dropping to second place last weekend was ``Another 48 HRS.,''
revisiting the police adventures of Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy.
The poorly reviewed film collected $10.7 million.
   ``Total Recall,'' Schwarzenegger's sci-fi thriller, fell to
third place with $10.2 million.
   Here are the top movie ticket sales for Friday through Monday as
tallied by Exhibitor Relations, with distributor, weekend gross,
number of theater screens, average per screen, total gross and
number of weeks in release.
   Figures are based on a combination of actual box-office receipts
and studio projections where actual figures are not immediately
available.
   1. ``Dick Tracy,'' Disney, $22.5 million, 2,332 screens, $9,667
per screen, $22.5 million, one week.
   2. ``Another 48 HRS.,'' Paramount, $10.7 million, 2,301 screens,
$4,660 per screen, $37.7 million, two weeks.
   3. ``Total Recall,'' Tri-Star, $10.2 million, 2,095 screens,
$4,880 per screen, $67.6 million, three weeks.
   4. ``Gremlins 2: The New Batch,'' Warner Bros., $9.7 million,
2,075 screens, $4,676 per screen, $9.7 million, one week.
   5. ``Back to the Future Part III,'' Universal, $4.9 million,
2,070 screens, $2,345 per screen, $57.6 million, four weeks.
   6. ``Pretty Woman,'' Disney, $3.3 million, 1,602 screens, $2,077
per screen, $138.8 million, 13 weeks.
   7. ``Bird on a Wire,'' Universal, $3.2 million, 1,620 screens,
$1,945 per screen, $55 million, five weeks.
   8. ``The Adventures of Milo and Otis,'' MGM-UA, $1.7 million,
914 screens, $1,869 per screen, $1.7 million, one week.
   9. ``Cadillac Man,'' Orion, $859,196, 1,141 screens, $753 per
screen, $24 million, five weeks.
   10. ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,'' New Line, $857,317, 1,165

<HEAD>Doctors Warn of Espresso Maker's Wrist</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Add two new dangers to life in the trendy
lane: espresso maker's wrist and choking from eating
ever-so-lightly done California cuisine while wearing a dental
retainer.
   Cases of the two new perils of modern living were reported in
letters published in the June issue of the Western Journal of
Medicine.
   In one case, Berkeley physician Dennis Shusterman said that
during a visit to a restaurant, he noticed an elastic bandage
around the owner's right wrist.
   The restaurateur told the doctor he had suffered increasing
wrist pain for two months.
   ``The pain was exacerbated each time he inserted spigots
containing fresh coffee grounds into an espresso machine with a
rotating motion of the handle _ a maneuver that he repeated 80 to
100 times a day,'' Shusterman wrote.
   The doctor performed tests an determined the restaurant owner
suffered De Quervain's tenosynovitis, an inflammation of the sheath
surrounding a tendon in the wrist. The condition previously was
seen in assembly line workers and in women who spend a lot of time
wringing wet clothes, Shusterman said.
   ``While the prevalence of this disorder among espresso makers is
unknown, the recent surge in popularity of espresso drinking may
place additional persons at risk,'' he wrote.
   The second hazard involved choking ``associated with two
relatively recent trends: adult orthodontics and California
cuisine,'' said a letter by Drs. Albert W. Wu and Haya R. Rubin of
the medical school at the University of California at San Francisco.
   The patient was a 31-year-old woman who had worn braces for an
improper bite, had the bands removed, and then was fitted with a
retainer, which she was told to wear even during meals.
   ``At a lunch meeting, while discussing the benefits of a low-fat
diet over a platter of al dente vegetables, she suddenly stood and
raised both hands to her neck in the international sign of
choking,'' Wu and Rubin wrote.
   ``Her companion did a prompt Heimlich maneuver, ejecting an
intact, nearly 2-inch-long piece of broccoli,'' they said.
   The doctors said the broccoli had lodged in her throat between
her windpipe and the back of the retainer.
   The doctors said that to their knowledge, ``this is the first
report of choking associated with an orthodontic appliance.
Patients should consider removing their retainers before eating.''
   As for the case of espresso maker's wrist, the restaurant owner
recovered almost completely after spending three weeks letting his
right wrist rest and taking nonprescription anti-inflammatory
medicine, Shusterman said.
   ``He adapted to this occupational disability by using his
opposite hand to insert spigots into the espresso machine, taking
care to avoid any abrupt or strenuous maneuvers in the process,''
the doctor said.

<HEAD>Administration Seeking to Prevent New Construction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration wants assurances from
the Senate that a proposed overhaul of the government's housing
programs will not be used to begin a new wave of public housing
construction.
   As the Senate began debating a bill Monday to discard
scandal-plagued Housing and Urban Development programs of the past
20 years, administration officials indicated a willingness to
accept $3 billion more in spending on housing than it wanted, but
only on condition.
   Budget director Richard Darman said the administration wants
sections of the bill rewritten to assure that new construction of
public housing is de-emphasized in favor of renovating and
preserving the current stock of dilapidated and unused units.
   It also wants stronger language on targeting the new aid to the
poor rather than middle-income families. And it seeks a requirement
that buyers using Federal Housing Administration-backed mortgages
put up more of their own money in the closing costs as a
disincentive for walking away from the loans.
   Darman and Housing Secretary Jack Kemp met with Sen. Alan
Cranston, D-Calif., and other Democratic and Republican authors of
the bill Monday morning.
   Their aides continued the negotiations throughout the afternoon,
and Cranston said he doubted that final Senate action on the bill
will be completed this week.
   House Democrats, meanwhile, want to bring similar legislation to
the floor before Congress recesses for the July Fourth holiday at
the end of next week.
   The Senate bill would scuttle or consolidate several existing
programs under a proposed new Housing Opportunity Partnership that
would funnel some $2 billion next year to state and local
governments for rehabilitating affordable housing for the poor.
   Sixty percent of the money would go to cities and 40 percent to
state governments, which would be required to match from their own
tax receipts $1 for every $3 in federal aid they receive.
   In addition, the legislation would extend for two years the
$124,875 ceiling on FHA-insured mortgages that Congress last year
raised from $101,250 in most high-cost areas.
   In his proposed budget for fiscal 1991, beginning next Oct 1.,
President Bush proposed increasing the current $14.5 billion in
federal spending on housing by only $80 million.
   However, Cranston quoted Darman and Kemp as telling senators at
Monday's meeting that Bush would not veto the Senate Banking
Committee's $17.6 billion version if compromises can be found on
new housing construction, how the money is targeted and new
protections for the FHA insurance fund.
   ``If we can work these three policy areas out, we're prepared to
go well over our budget. I assure you we would not veto the bill on
the dollar figures alone,'' Cranston quoted Darman as saying.
   Although Darman offered no specific dollar figure acceptable to
the administration, Cranston said he was confident that Bush would
accept a $3 billion increase.
   Coupled with anticipated increases of $4.2 billion in fiscal
1992 and $4.8 billion in fiscal 1993, the legislation would provide
housing assistance to an additional 730,000 low-income families, he
said.
   Cranston expressed confidence that compromises with the
administration on new public housing construction and targeted aid
to the poor could be found easily.
   More complicated, he said, will be finding an accord on measures
to bolster the security of the FHA insurance funds. He said the
administration's proposal ``in a typical case'' would raise the
upfront closing costs to a young family seeking their first home
with an FHA-insured mortgage from $3,500 to $4,400.
   ``An increase that big would knock many people out of the
market,'' Cranston said. ``We believe we can avoid that and still
assure that the fund remains actuarially sound.''
   The FHA lost $4.2 billion to bad loans in 1988 and now has a net
worth of only $2.6 billion, compared with $8 billion in 1979.
   If housing prices _ which are now flat or falling in much of the
country _ don't rise at least 4 percent a year, the FHA insurance
fund will require an infusion of tax dollars to remain afloat, the
congressional General Accounting Office said earlier this month.

<HEAD>Catholic, Jewish Groups Call for Moral Teachings in Schools</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An interfaith group of religious leaders
called today for a renewed effort to teach children common moral
values in school, ``apart from the context of a specific faith.''
   ``Children lack fundamental values _ like honesty, integrity,
tolerance, loyalty and belief in human worth and dignity,'' the
National Council of Catholic Bishops and the Synagogue Council of
America said in a joint statement.
   ``All of these values are grounded in our respective religious
traditions, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, much of the
world's great literature and ethical business practices,'' the
statement said.
   The two groups said their unprecedented cooperative statement
was prompted by a rash of problems besetting American youth: from
drug addiction, depression, suicide, crime, alienation and AIDS to
academic failure, emotional illness, teen pregnancy, alcoholism,
intolerance and violence.
   ``In our society, parents can use all the help they can get,''
the rabbis and bishops said. ``Therefore, it is urgent that there
be a national effort to implement moral public education in our
schools.''
   The religious leaders condemned what they called a growing
reluctance to teach fundamental values in the public school system
for fear of indoctrinating children with religious beliefs.
   ``We are convinced that even apart from the context of a
specific faith, it is possible to teach these shared values,'' they
said.
   The two groups made several recommendations:
   _State governors and legislators should create committees to
promote values education in public schools.
   _Public schools should introduce moral education into their
curricula, stressing basic civic and personal values.
   _All faiths should work together to bring about systemic change.
   _Foundations should underwrite values education programs in
public schools.
   _The media, especially television, should promote civic and
personal values in their programming.
   The two religious groups asked Roman Catholics and Jews to begin
a widespread dialogue about moral education in the public schools
and said they would emphasize anew their commitment to moral values
in their own educational institutions.

<HEAD>Hungary's Intelligence Head Says American Helped Cause of Peace</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of military intelligence in
Hungary says a former U.S. military man's spying for the East bloc
may have actually helped the cause of peace.
   Retired Army Sgt. Clyde Lee Conrad, 43, was sentenced to life in
prison this month by a West German court that found him guilty of
passing secrets to Hungary and Czechoslovakia from 1975 through
1985 in return for $1.2 million.
   The trial judge in the case said Conrad, who was convicted of
treason, had ``endangered the entire defense capability of the
West.''
   But Brig. Gen. Janos Kovacs, who has headed Hungarian military
intelligence since October, said the spying probably led to better
East-West ties _ because the information Conrad produced made it
clear NATO was not planning to attack the Soviet Union or its
allies.
   Kovacs said in an interview Monday that this knowledge helped
lead to a new approach to East-West relations on the part of the
Warsaw Pact.
   ``The interesting paradox was that Conrad's information helped
prove that there are no offensive NATO plans and this led
sober-thinking people to reassess the situation and to develop a
new approach,'' he said.
   The two military alliances, the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact, are now undergoing
identity crises and discussing taking on a greater political role
now that Eastern Europe has freed itself of Soviet domination.
   Hungarian leaders have said they wish to quit the Warsaw Pact's
military organization by the end of next year.
   Kovacs said that as far as he knows just one person, Istvan
Belovai, is in jail in Hungary for spying for the United States.
Belovai is a former assistant military attache in the Hungarian
embassy in London.
   The news magazine Beszeloe carried an interview with Belovai in
its June 16 edutions that quoted him as saying he contacted the CIA
``because he was shocked at the volume of NATO secrets making their
way to the Soviets via Hungarian intelligence sources.''
   Belovai is due to serve another 15 years. His espionage trial
was secret and the magazine did not say when he was sentenced.
   Asked about the renegade CIA agent Edward Lee Howard, who
defected to the Soviet Union just a step ahead of the FBI and later
moved to Hungary, Kovacs said ``to the best of my knowledge''
Howard left Hungary in January.
   He said he did not know where Howard had gone. U.S. officials
said late last year that they had been trying for months to
persuade Hungary to expel Howard.
   Asked about Roderick James Ramsay, arrested June 7 in Tampa,
Fla., and charged with conspiracy to gather or deliver defense
information to aid a foreign government, Kovacs said ``we knew
nothing of Ramsay.''
   Ramsay, 28, who allegedly worked directly under Conrad, could
face a life sentence if convicted.
   Kovacs said Hungary is seeking to put the Cold War spy era
behind it.
   ``While conducting, among other things, intelligence activities,
we consider it vital to share information on terrorism, narcotics
traffic, and on the transfer of biological, chemical and nuclear
weapons and their components,'' he said.

   When Nelson Mandela visits the Land of the Free,
he might glimpse America's own racial inequities.
   ``Even Africans from the black-dominated countries tend to be
surprised at the level of prejudice and racism that still exists''
in the United States, said Linda Williams, a research fellow in
race issues at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government.
   The South African anti-apartheid activist, who will be in New
York from Wednesday through Friday, will ``come away with a rather
mixed feeling,'' said Daniel Walkowitz, director of New York
University's Urban Studies Program.
   ``There are strong signs of the ways in which blacks are
integrated into American life _ and also the tragic irony of the
way their situation has become polarized at the same time,'' said
Walkowitz.
   The National Commission on Children released a report in April
that said the poverty rate in 1987 was 45 percent for black
children, 39 percent for Hispanic children and 15 percent for white
children.
   A congressional study released in October found that black
males, age 15 to 19, die by homicide, execution or as a result of
police actions at the rate of 51.5 per 100,000. White males in the
same age group die at the rate of 8.6 per 100,000 in the same
circumstances, it said.
   Saskia Sassen, director of urban planning at Columbia
University, agreed that many black South Africans _ despite their
own, complex struggle _ might be ``shocked if they saw what we
see'' in the United States.
   ``There is a growing, physical separation of blacks and whites
in this country,'' said Sassen. ``Part of it has to do with
economy, part of it with the housing market and part of it with
racism.''
   Sassen said 70 percent of the nation's blacks live in the 100
largest cities. ``Public schools, for example, in New York and
Chicago, are increasingly all minority; white public schools are in
the suburbs,'' Sassen said. ``We are creating two societies.''
   AIDS, homelessness, drug abuse, poverty and broken homes also
can spell hopelessness for inner-city blacks.
   The congressional study said that in 1988, less than 40 percent
of black children lived with both parents, compared with 79 percent
of white children. In 1980, the figures were 82.7 percent of white
children and 42.2 percent of black children.
   A January report in the New England Journal of Medicine said
that, partly because of a lack of basic health care, the life
expectancy of a male born and living in Harlem is likely to be
shorter than that of one born in Bangladesh.
   Despite the problems, ``We have a legal system that guarantees
the rights of all people, and that is an incredibly powerful tool _
it's the crucial distinction'' from South Africa, said Sassen.
   Williams noted that Mandela's main goal is to garner support for
blacks in South Africa, not to study American problems.
   ``People should not expect him to be a leader for black
America,'' she said. ``We'll have to have our own, home-grown
Nelson Mandelas. Symbolically, he will raise the spirits of black
America.''
   ``I think that we have had, to a very great extent, similarities
(with black Americans) in our struggle,'' said Walter Sisulu,
internal leadership chairman of the African National Congress, who
was imprisoned with Mandela.
   Sisulu said from South Africa that Mandela will listen to issues
concerning black Americans while asking Americans' help for his own
country.
   ``We know conditions in some areas are quite poor,'' he said.
``No doubt they will derive inspiration from Mr. Mandela.''
   Mandela's New York visit in his first stop on an eight-city U.S.
tour. His U.S. stay is part of a six-week tour of 14 nations in
Africa, Europe and North America that began June 6.
   Mandela, 71, was freed from South African prison in February
after serving 27 years of a life sentence for sabotage and plotting
to overthrow the white-minority government.

<TEXT>
   President Bush is prepared to veto a bill that
guarantees parental-care leave to workers even though as a
candidate in 1988 he endorsed such time off in his appeal for a
``kinder, gentler'' America.
   The White House insisted Monday that Bush's position hasn't
changed. Then, as now, he only supports such protection if it is
voluntary for employers, said presidential spokeswoman Alixe Glen.
   ``He has always been opposed to the federal government dictating
or mandating what every business in this country should do. This
particular bill would badly impact a lot of companies,'' Ms. Glen
said.
   At issue is legislation given final congressional approval last
Thursday that would guarantee workers as much as 12 weeks' unpaid
leave for childbirth, adoption or serious family illnesses. The
measure would apply to all businesses with 50 or more employees.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush stands
ready to cast the 13th veto of his presidency on the leave bill.
``I wouldn't be surprised to see it this week,'' he said.
   The president has yet to have a veto overridden.
   Fitzwater said that as of Monday, the bill had not reached the
White House. But he indicated Bush would deal with it swiftly once
it arrives.
   During his presidential campaign, Bush touched on the issue of
parental care as he spoke to a Republican women's group in
Rockford, Ill., on Sept. 9, 1988.
   Departing from his text, then-Vice President Bush told the
Illinois Federation of Republican Women: ``Look, we also need to
assure that women don't have to worry about getting their jobs back
after having a child or caring for a child during serious illness.''
   Bush did not elaborate at the time on whether the protection
should be voluntary on the part of businesses.
   When asked about Bush's 1988 comment Monday, Fitzwater said:
``I'm not aware of what he said during the campaign. I had not
heard that before.''
   Fitzwater was press secretary for then-President Reagan
throughout 1988.
   The spokesman said Bush opposes the present legislation because
``it is a federally mandated benefit, and we're opposed to
federally mandated benefits.''
   Ms. Glen, who was a 1988 Bush campaign aide and is now a deputy
press secretary, remembered Bush's remarks. But she said he did not
mean to suggest at the time that he favored government-mandated
family leaves.
   Bush ``supports and encourages parental and medical leave
policies that are designed to meet the needs of individual
companies and employees,'' she said.
   She said that since taking office, Bush has urged businesses to
adopt flexible parental-leave programs and has called on members of
his Cabinet to follow such policies in their own departments.
   As an example, Ms. Glen cited a recent directive urging a
liberal leave policy for federal employees who adopt a child.
   The bill approved by Congress last week ``reduces small business
flexibility, reduces U.S. competiveness and really could undermine
the current trend toward flexible policies,'' she said.

<HEAD>US-Soviet Accord on Bering Sea Producing No Bonanzas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Settlement of a 123-year-old dispute between
the United States and the Soviet Union over the maritime boundary
in the Bering Sea is unlikely to prove a bonanza to the fishermen
and oil drillers of either nation.
   ``Neither side can say they beat anybody out of anything,'' says
Clement Tillion, an Alaska commercial fisherman who is chairman of
the American section of the International North Pacific Fisheries
Commission. ``It's a very nice agreement.''
   Tillion and others said that for the fishermen of both countries
the main benefit of the agreement, signed with little fanfare
during the recent U.S.-Soviet summit here, will be that they now
know for sure where the line is supposed to be.
   For oilmen, the effect will be less than for fishermen. There
are lots of fish in the Bering Sea, but nobody has yet discovered
any oil.
   The dispute arose out of the negotiations that led to the U.S.
purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867. The argument has revolved
around whether the negotiators used a terrestrial globe or a
Mercator projection map.
   ``There's a 60-mile difference in the middle because of the
distortion of the Mercator projection,'' Tillion said in a recent
interview. ``We, in effect, split the difference.''
   A State Department official, speaking on condition he not be
identified, said the boundary line did not become an issue until
the 1970s, when both sides claimed exclusive jurisdiction to 200
miles offshore.
   ``Then they started bumping up against each other,'' he said.
   In the most recent of many incidents, the Coast Guard seized a
Soviet fishing vessel on May 11 after authorities said it was
caught with its nets in the water inside the U.S. 200-mile fishery
limit.
   ``Now the fishermen can fish without threat of being harassed
because of the uncertainty of the boundary line,'' the State
Department official said.
   Tillion, however, cautioned against expecting that fishermen
will no longer get in trouble by straying over the border.
   ``Commercial fishermen are larcenous,'' he said.
   As for oil, ``It doesn't really make a lot of material
difference,'' said Susan Hall, a spokeswoman for the Minerals
Management Service in the Interior Department. ``We didn't lose or
gain, resource-wise, by it.''
   ``The advantage of course is that it is settled,'' Ms. Hall
said. ``It does define beyond dispute a sort of western edge to our
planning areas.''
   Oil companies spent hundreds of millions of dollars in the early
1980s on Bering Sea oil and gas exploration leases but discovered
nothing. They generally shied away from tracts inside the disputed
area.
   Despite the agreement, spokesman Bill Smith of Exxon, one of the
leaders in the earlier bidding, said the company had no plans at
present for further Bering Sea exploration.
   ``It is too early for us to say anything about it,'' Smith said.
``We do not know what the effects will be.''
   The Soviets conceded their rights to the United States in three
areas within their 200-mile zone and the United States made a
similar concession regarding an area farther south within its zone,
the State Department official said.
   Tillion said this gives the United States the right to manage
the pollock fishery in the areas that it gains. He said the Soviet
gains were smaller, but on neither side did they amount to very
much.
   ``It's almost a wash,'' he said.
   Giorgi Shchekochikhin, a spokesman for the Soviet Embassy, said,
``The basic provisions of this treaty eliminate a problem between
the two countries in the Pacific.''
   In the past, he said, most official U.S.-Soviet dealings had
been between the East Coast of the United States and the Western
part of the Soviet Union.
   With increasing contacts between Siberia and Alaska, he said,
``it is becoming of more major importance to have no more problems
between our two countries at this point.''

   Inocencio Muniz did not even wait until
the police officer had returned to his patrol car before ignoring a
warning not to drive until he sobered up.
   Muniz's next warning _ about his right to remain silent and have
an attorney _ did not come until after police videotaped him
slurring his speech in response to questions about his age, height
and weight.
   The Supreme Court ruled 8-1 Monday that police did not violate
the Pennsylvania motorist's rights by videotaping his answers to
the routine questions, and it ordered a lower court to consider
reinstating his drunken driving conviction.
   The decision, along with a Supreme Court ruling in a Michigan
case last week that sobriety checkpoints do not violate motorists'
rights, have strengthened police powers to curb drunken driving at
what some civil liberatarians say is too high a price.
   ``There seems to be the continued pattern of the high court
cutting back on the rights we thought we enjoyed,'' said Stefan
Presser, legal director of the Pennsylvania American Civil
Liberties Union.
   But Sherry Walker, executive director of the Pennsylvania
chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, said the benefits of
roadblocks and video cameras outweigh any inconvenience.
   ``The decisions are the will of the majority of Americans who
are fed up with the senseless, daily slaughter,'' Ms. Walker said.
   In 1988, a total 23,351 people died in drunken driving accidents.
   Muniz was arrested by Upper Allen Township police in 1986 after
an officer noticed Muniz's car stopped by the side of the road with
the motor running.
   The officer said he smelled alcohol on Muniz's breath and that
the man's eyes were glazed and bloodshot. The officer said he told
Muniz not to drive until he was in a condition to operate the car
safely, but Muniz drove off anyway.
   The patrolman pursued Muniz, ordered him to stop and told him to
perform some sobriety tests. Muniz failed all the tests.
   The officer took Muniz to a police station where the motorist
was videotaped answering questions about his name, address, height
and other personal characteristics.
   Only after those responses was Muniz read his rights.
   Muniz, convicted previously of drunken driving, was convicted
again and sentenced to 45 days to 23 months in prison. The Supreme
Court action Monday reversed a Pennsylvania appeals court ruling
that threw out the conviction.
   Justice William J. Brennan, writing for the court, said the
judge who convicted Muniz was entitled to hear the slurred manner
in which Muniz responded to the questions.
   Law enforcement officials applauded the decision.
   ``It gives us a couple more tools to work with,'' said Upper
Allen Township Police Chief Richard Hammon. ``It's not acceptable
to drink and drive anymore, and the court says here are a few more
tools.''
   Hammon said if a police officer reads a person their rights
first, ``they will quit talking.''
   Presser said he worried the decision and the one allowing
roadblocks restrict individual rights.
   ``While it looks common-sensical to get these people off the
road, and we want drunks off the road, roadblocks can be used for
lots of purposes,'' he said. ``It's unfortunate to go down this
path, no matter how much to the good it looks like at this moment.''

<HEAD>Tobacco Farms on the Decline</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of farms growing tobacco in the
United States is declining, and an Agriculture Department analyst
says the trend will probably continue.
   In 1987, only 137,000 farms produced tobacco, an average of 4.6
acres per farm. That compared with 179,000 farms and an average of
5.2 acres in 1982.
   The figures were reported in a new outlook report by Verner N.
Grise and Thomas Capehart of the department's Economic Research
Service. The figures were based on the government's Census of
Agriculture, which is taken every five years.
   Going back further, the report said the 137,000 farms growing
tobacco in 1987 represented a 73 percent drop from 512,000 in 1954.
   ``In North Carolina, the major flue-cured state, the drop was 85
percent, from 150,000 to 22,000,'' the report said.
   Consolidations occurred because of 1961 changes in the
government's program that allowed the lease and transfer of closely
guarded tobacco quotas within counties, the report said. That
practice, except under emergency conditions, was abolished in 1987.
   Outright sales of quotas within counties were authorized in
1982, also helping to speed consolidations, the report said. And
there were a number of advances in technology and marketing that
reduced labor requirements.
   The number of producers in Kentucky, the major producer of
burley tobacco, declined but not as dramatically as in flue-cured
areas.
   ``The decline in the number of burley producers has been slower
because labor-reducing technologies have not been adopted as
rapidly,'' the report said. ``There has been little mechanization
of the burley harvest, and only since the late 1970s has it been
sold looseleaf in bales.''
   In 1954, the report said, 29 percent of the U.S. farms that grew
tobacco were in North Carolina. By 1987, that had dropped to 16
percent because the number of grower plunged so steeply, from
150,000 to 22,000.
   Meanwhile, 27 percent of farms that grew tobacco were in
Kentucky, compared with 45 percent in 1987, reflecting a relative
smaller decline in the number of producers _ 136,000 to 62,000.
   ``Similar changes occurred in the other flue-cured and burley
producing states,'' the report said.
   In 1987, the average of 4.6 acres of tobacco grown per farm was
down from 5.2 in 1982 because of the large cutback in production
during the five-year period, the report said. Prior to that, the
average per farm showed steady growth from 1959 when it was 2.7
acres.
   ``Still, the averages tend to hide the diversity in tobacco
growing,'' the report said. ``For example, in 1987 average per farm
varied from 1.6 in West Virginia to 35.4 in Connecticut.''
   The acreage varies by type of tobacco grown, tenure
arrangements, topography, technology, competing crops and
availability of labor, the report said.

   A joint research project by the United States
and Soviet Union will sent 14 scientists into the back country of
Siberia this summer to study climate changes.
   The Agriculture Department said Tuesday the team _ seven from
each country _ then will collect similar information in the United
States. Names of the scientists were not announced.
   The project is sponsored by the department's Forest Service and
Moscow's State Forest Committee. Officials said the objective is to
gather information to assess the possible effects of climate change
on forests.
   The project is organized by the Institute for Resource
Management, a non-profit environmental organization founded by
actor Robert Redford.
   Field research will be coordinated by the University of
California at Santa Barbara under the direction of Daniel B. Botkin
and the Soviet Union's All-Union Scientific Research Center of the
State Forest Committee, directed by Anatoly Z. Shvidenko.
   Patricia Kearney, acting assistant secretary for natural
resources and environment, said in a statement the cooperative
venture is ``a unique opportunity to work cooperatively with the
Soviet Union'' toward improved management of natural resources.
   Kearney and Terrell Minger, president of the institute, are in
Moscow attending a climate change workshop to coordinate procedures
and plans for the project.
   The Soviet research sites are in Yakutsk, in eastern Siberia,
and in the Komi region in western Russia.
   After two months, the team will collect similar information at
the U.S. sites in Caribou Creek, Alaska, approximately 40 miles
north of Fairbanks, and the Boundary Waters Canoe Area in the
Superior National Forest, Minnesota.

   U.S. food exporters might be able to boost
sales in West Germany through in-store promotions, says an
Agriculture Department trade report. That's because Germans are
impulsive shoppers.
   According to a recent survey by the West German Agricultural
Marketing Board, nearly two-thirds of the nation's consumers are
impulsive shoppers, meaning they decide on what to buy after
they're in the store.
   ``This indicates that the trade has the potential to influence
consumers' purchasing decisions through special in-store promotions
and introduction of new-to-market products,'' the report said.

<HEAD>Radio Solidarity Reaches the Airwaves, Legally for a Change</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The once banned and hunted Radio
Solidarity has finally taken to the airwaves legally.
   On Monday, the radio station that operated underground for eight
years began regular daily FM broadcasts to the Warsaw region.
Programming is to feature music and independent news reports.
   At first, the station is to broadcast 6{ hours a day.
Eventually, it plans to have programming 20 hours a day, the
state-run PAP news agency reported.
   The station is a private company jointly owned by the Foundation
of Radio Solidarity, an English company called Radio Trust, the
state Radio Committee and a British citizen, Ludomir Lasocki. All
earnings from the station in its first three years are to be
reinvested in the station.
   The station had operated illegally from March 1982 until April
28, 1989, when it was permitted limited broadcasts on state radio
channels as part of the agreement with then-Communist authorities
to promote Solidarity's electoral campaign.
   The last such electoral broadcast was June 30, and the
underground activists associated with Radio Solidarity immediately
began planning for legal operation on a separate wavelength.
   According to PAP, the selection of topics for broadcasts will
depend largely on listeners, with whom the station hopes to be in
``permanent contact.''
   Radio Solidarity was born four months after the December 1981
martial-law crackdown on Solidarity. It made brief clandestine
broadcasts from time to time on various FM frequencies using hidden
transmitters.
   Occasionally, it would broadcast audio messages on the
frequencies used by state television, interrupting the official
news.
   It was constantly playing hide-and-seek with the police, who
with limited success would track the signal to seize the
transmitters and broadcasters.
   Officials also learned to counter the broadcasts by jamming them
with loud disco music.

<HEAD>Inspections Probably Would Miss Plane Engine Rotor Cracks:
Investigators</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two inspections missed the crack in an engine
rotor disk that led to the crash of a United Air Lines jetliner
last summer, and current inspections probably would fail too,
according to federal safety investigators.
   One hundred twelve people out of 396 on board the DC-10 died as
a result of the crash during an emergency landing attempt at Sioux
City last July 19.
   The National Transportation Safety Board said Monday the flaw
that led to the crack might have been caught if a manufacturing
inspection step using chemical etching had been done on the disk
carrying engine fan blades in its final shape, rather than an
intermediate shape.
   Another in-service inspection should have caught the crack, the
board said, and it's not known why it didn't.
   The new ultrasonic inspection routines ordered by the Federal
Aviation Administration last fall ``are inadequate to detect these
potentially critical cracks,'' the board said in a letter to the
FAA. These methods detect cracks by passing high-frequency sound
waves through the materials.
   The board called on the FAA to require the chemical etching
inspection during manufacturing on the final, instead of an
intermediate, part shape, and called for the agency to substitute
another inspection method such as electrical eddy current testing
for the in-service ultrasonic methods it ordered last fall.
   Computer modeling by the manufacturer has shown that, using one
ultrasonic method, such surface cracks ``could propagate from a
size just below the level of detectability to a critical size in
significantly fewer than 500'' flights, and the second ultrasonic
method ordered may be no better at spotting subsurface cracks, the
board said.
   Before the crash, there was no federal requirement for
inspecting the part in question, but the manufacturer's
specifications called for airlines to look for surface cracks in
ultraviolet light after a special wash every time the engine was
disassembled.
   Such a test was performed 760 flights before the crash, and the
engine passed. ``The safety board's investigation has revealed
evidence suggesting that, at the time of this fluorescent penetrant
inspection, the crack was of detectable size. ...The safety board
has not yet determined if the crack was not detected because of an
inadequate inspection method, an inadequate application of that
method, or a combination of both,'' the board wrote.
   It did not discuss what this evidence is.
   In another recommendation, the board also called on the FAA to
adopt for engines the assumption now used for aircraft structures
when calculating inspection intervals _ not that the part is
flawless originally, but that it contains a flaw just below the
level of detectability.
   There were 227 General Electric Co. CF6-6 engines in service on
early models of the DC-10 containing rotor disks made from a
process changed in 1971. Six made from the same ingot of titanium
were removed from service and regular ultrasonic inspections
ordered for the rest made from different ingots.
   The middle, tail-mounted engine of the three on the DC-10
exploded in flight after a fatigue crack on the inner bore (hole in
the doughnut) surface of the rotor grew so large that it came apart
while rapidly rotating. It was the first time such a disk had
disintegrated.
   The shrapnel-like pieces of the engine severed all hydraulic
lines to the plane's control surfaces, leaving the aircraft almost
impossible to control, and forcing the pilots to try to bring it to
the ground by varying the power on the two remaining, wing-mounted
engines.
   The aircraft manufacturer, McDonnell-Douglas Corp., has added
valves to the hydraulic system to keep some fluid in the lines, and
at least some controllability, in such an accident.

   The Food and Drug Administration is putting
out the word that some models of a device designed to warn parents
that an infant has stopped breathing may not do the job.
   The device, also used to monitor adults who suffer apnea, is
manufactured by Electronic Monitors Inc. of Euless, Texas, the FDA
said. Those who suffer from apnea temporarily stop breathing during
sleep.
   The models involved are RE-134B and Mon-A-Therm Respirate, for
those older than 4 years old, and Models RE-134C and RE-134D for
infants.
   ``Some models may fail to signal an alarm,'' the FDA said in
issuing a first-class alert, its most serious health warning. The
agency said the problem is with a defective time delay switch.
   FDA said the company was recalling the 1,583 monitors it
distributed. Sixty percent went to hospitals and the rest were sent
to home health care agencies that rent or distribute them to the
public.
   ``It is not known how many are still being used by consumers,''
the FDA said.

<HEAD>Businesses Caught Using Child Workers Face Fines Over $1 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 700 businesses caught illegally
employing 3,800 youngsters during a one-day federal sweep this
month face more than $1 million in fines, the Labor Department says.
   Most of the child labor violations involved youngsters working
more hours than is allowed under federal labor law, the agency said
Monday.
   But there were also 490 minors, mostly 16- and 17-year-olds, who
were working at dangerous tasks such as using power-driven meat
slicers or paper-baling machines.
   The June 6 sweep, in which investigators visited 2,033
businesses, uncovered violations in 753 establishments, or at 37
percent of the companies visited nationwide, the department said.
The names of the companies were not released.
   The most recent sweep is part of an ongoing effort to crack down
on employers illegally using teen-age labor.
   In March, investigators working on a three-day sweep visited
3,400 businesses and found that nearly half were in apparent
violation of child labor laws.
   Investigators have found 15,500 violations as a result of the
March sweep. Fines from that effort are expected to total $5
million.

<HEAD>City Building Monument to Famous Ghost</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMPBELLTOWN, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most cities would shun the name
``ghost town.'' Campbelltown embraces it wholeheartedly.
   The city of 140,000 people is growing briskly. But it would like
to see a few more tourists from Sydney, about 25 miles to the
northeast.
   So officials are investing $200,000 to build a special monument
to the city's most famous resident _ Fisher's Ghost.
   ``We want to be known as the liveliest ghost town in the South
Hemisphere,'' Alderman John Hennessey, one of the project's
backers, said today.
   Campbelltown already has a 32-year-old Fisher's Ghost's Festival
two weeks each November. As many as 50,000 people attend the annual
parade.
   Now comes the 20-foot glass monument, which will contain 60 tons
of glass in about 480 sheets. It will feature special lighting at
night and fog machines to enhance the supernatural effect.
   Fred Fisher was a former convict who by 1826 was a wealthy
farmer and builder. He stabbed a man during a fight and, expecting
a long jail term, gave power-of-attorney over his considerable
holdings to his neighbor, an ex-convict named George Worrall.
   On the evening of June 17, 1826, Fisher disappeared. Worrall
said he had sailed for England, but officials got suspicious when
Worrall started selling off Fisher's possessions.
   This is where legend and historians diverge.
   According to legend, a farmer named John Farley spotted the
ghost while walking home one night after a stint at the local pub.
Farley is said to have sparked the murder investigation after
seeing the ghost sitting on a bridge railing, pointing a finger
upstream, where Fisher's body was found.
   But Carol Liston, author of Campbelltown's Bicentennial History,
says in her official version that two boys found bloodstains, a
lock of hair and a tooth on a fence on Worrall's farm. A tracker
then discovered Fisher's remains in a shallow grave.
   Whatever the truth, Worrall was tried and convicted for murder,
then confessed on the gallows before he was hung.
   Hennessey said Fisher's ghost has been seen at least four times
since the farmer's murder, including once 20 years ago on the
anniversary of the death when many in a crowd of 20,000 claimed to
have spotted the specter.

   Nelson Mandela says South Africa is on the

   As the black nationalist leader addressed a rally outside
Ontario's provincial legislature in Toronto, many people stood with

``Mandela!'' and ``Freedom!''
   Mandela, who arrived in the Canadian capital of Ottawa on
Sunday, was flying to Montreal today. On Wednesday, he is to travel
to New York to begin an eight-city U.S. tour.
   The 71-year-old African National Congress leader appeared strong
and fit as he addressed the rally Monday, but he canceled an
afternoon speech at Toronto's city hall, citing fatigue.
   His wife, Winnie, instead attended for him.
   ``We are on the threshold of major change in South Africa,'' he
told the crowd. ``We are confident that victory is in sight, but as
in a steeplechase race, the last hurdles are the most difficult to
jump.''
   Earlier Monday, Mandela addressed Canada's Parliament and called
for maintaining economic sanctions against South Africa to ensure
that reforms continue.
   ``Any move at this stage toward lifting or lessening
international pressure would create a situation in which the white
minority would feel comfortable with the minimal changes which have
taken place,'' Mandela told a joint session of the House of Commons
and the Senate.
   Canada imposed economic and political sanctions on South Africa
in 1986. Like many other countries, it has pledged to maintain the
bans until there is clear evidence of irreversible change in the
apartheid system of racial segregation.
   President F.W. de Klerk of South Africa has argued that the
reforms show that his country is changing and he has urged foreign
countries to lift economic sanctions.
   In his speech, Mandela paid tribute to black South Africans who,
during years of oppression, ``met torture without flinching'' and
``met the hangman's noose with songs of freedom.''
   He was interrupted several times by applause and received a long
standing ovation from lawmakers.
   Mandela is in the midst of a six-week tour of 14 nations in
Africa, Europe and North America that began June 6. He was freed
from prison in February after serving 27 years of a life sentence
for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white-minority
government.
   His release was part of a program of social reforms by the de
Klerk government, including legalizing the ANC and other
anti-apartheid groups.
   De Klerk has also opened talks with black groups on giving a
political voice to the country's 28 million blacks. South Africa's
5 million whites control the government and economy.
   At a dinner speech at a glitzy Toronto hotel, Mandela told a
mostly white audience that whites are not the enemy in the fight
against apartheid.
   ``We are facing a common front _ not against whites, but against
racial oppression,'' he said, to resounding applause.

<HEAD>East German Church Files Lawsuit in Artwork Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An East German church has filed a lawsuit
demanding the return of medieval artwork believed stolen by an
American officer in the final days of World War II.
   After hearing oral arguments by telephone Monday, U.S. District
Judge Sidney A. Fitzwater barred movement of the church treasures
without a court order.
   Fitzwater also ordered that representatives of the Lutheran
cathedral in Quedlinburg be allowed to inventory the cache. The
artwork is believed to be held in a bank in Whitewright, a town of
1,760 about 60 miles north of Dallas.
   The church hopes to recover 15 treasures that had been hidden in
a mineshaft during the war. The treasures disappeared in 1945,
shortly after American forces occupied the medieval castle town.
   Among the treasures, said Thomas R. Kline, the lawyer who filed
the lawsuit, are a rock crystal flask of Byzantine origin; a wooden
box decorated with silver, gold, ivory and precious stones, dating
from the 9th or 10th century and containing relics of Henry I; and
two manuscripts, one from about 1300 and the other from 1515, bound
in precious metals and encrusted with gems.
   Joe T. Meador, a former Army lieutenant who was among the U.S.
troops who entered Quedlinburg in April 1945, is believed to have
stolen the artifacts.
   After he died of cancer in 1980, his brother and sister, Jack
Meador of Whitewright and Jane Meador Cook of Mesquite, obtained
the treasures and stored at least some in a vault at the First
National Bank, The Dallas Morning News said today.
   They apparently sold at least two of the pieces, the bejeweled
illuminated manuscripts, the newspaper said.
   A secretary for Jack Meador told The Associated Press on Monday
night that Meador had no comment on the lawsuit. Mrs. Cook also
declined to comment.
   An affidavit filed with the lawsuit said a church representative
had met with bank President John Farley to demand the treasures.
Farley confirmed that some of the artifacts are at his bank, The
New York Times reported today.
   Farley said he first saw the artworks in 1986 ``when a customer
of the bank brought me two manuscripts to have appraised.'' He
would not reveal the customer's name or disclose the number of
artworks stored in the bank.
   Ely Maurer, a State Department assistant legal adviser for
cultural property, said the lawsuit was filed primarily because
negotiations for return of the collection reached an impasse during
the weekend.
   An unidentified FBI agent was quoted by the Morning News as
saying it was unclear whether charges could be brought in the case.
   He said that the statute of limitations for interstate
transportation of stolen property is five years and that
international treaties governing theft of art and antiquities have
a 30-year statute of limitations.
   Maurer said charges might be pursued under the National Stolen
Property Act, a statute prohibiting interstate or international
transport of stolen art.
   ``The law would extend to heirs who knowingly transferred the
property across state lines,'' Maurer said. ``The fact that they
moved some of the artworks as recently as this year might make the
statute apply.''
   He said there is evidence the family knew for some time that the
art was stolen.

   Despite a setback from the U.S. Supreme
Court, country music star Hank Williams Jr. plans to continue his
fight against a woman who claims to be his father's daughter.
   The high court Monday let stand a ruling that Cathy Yvonne
Stone, 37, a country music performer known as Jett Williams, is
entitled to have her fight for some of the late country music
legend's royalties put before a jury.
   At the same time, the court left intact an Alabama Supreme Court
ruling that declared Ms. Stone an heir to the elder Williams.
   ``The U.S. Supreme Court has refused to hear the case _ this is
not a judgement _ and we're simply going to seek other remedies,''
said Merle Kilgore, Hank Jr.'s manager.
   Ms. Stone was born in 1953, five days after Hank Sr. died at age
29. Her mother, Bobbie Jett, and Williams had signed an agreement
months earlier in which he acknowledged he might be the father of
the then-unborn child.
   Kilgore said representatives for Hank Jr. and other parties
involved in the royalties battle will meet sometime this week to
discuss strategy.
   Ms. Stone said she has won the five-year fight.
   ``I feel it's as big a victory for my father, Hank Williams, as
myself,'' she said. ``This is what should have been done in the
beginning.''

   Donald Trump, mired in marital and financial
problems, faces more trouble in trying to convert his Ambassador
Hotel property into a hotel and business complex.
   The city Board of Education voted 7-0 Monday to use its powers
of eminent domain to seize 17.6 acres of the 23.5-acre property for
a new high school to relieve overcrowding.
   Attorneys for Trump Wilshire Associates, the investment group
headed by the New York billionaire, said the dispute is probably
headed for the courts.
   The vote is the latest in a series of problems facing the
flamboyant Trump, whose marriage fell apart at the same time his
real estate and casino empire hit financial troubles.
   Trump Wilshire bought the property last year for $64 million.
The district estimates it is worth $47.9 million; Trump officials
value it at at least $150 million.
   The now-closed Ambassador Hotel is where Robert Kennedy was
assassinated moments after declaring victory in the California
Democratic presidential primary in 1968.

   Kurosawa, 80, who has made many historical epics among his 28
movies, was honored Monday by the Japan Society for increasing

Kurosawa Production, accepted the award for him.
   Kurosawa won Academy Awards for best foreign film in 1951 for
``Rashomon,'' in 1971 for ``Dodes' Ka'den,'' and in 1975 for the
Soviet-financed film, ``Dersu Uzala.'' He received an honorary

   Cable News Network will cover much of Nelson
Mandela's U.S. visit live, while CBS, NBC and ABC said most of
their coverage will be on their regular news programs.
   The South African anti-apartheid activist's three-day visit to

Airport. He leaves for Boston on Saturday.
   CNN's first-day live coverage will include his arrival, a ticker
tape parade up Broadway and a ceremony in which Mayor David Dinkins
gives Mandela the key to the city, CNN spokesman John Bianchi said.
   The network will also broadcast live such activities as a
motorcade through Harlem and a rally at Yankee Stadium on Thursday,
and Mandela's speech to the United Nations on Friday.
   Mandela will be a guest at a special ``town meeting'' to be
taped Thursday for broadcast that evening on ABC. He also will
appear that night on Ted Koppel's ``Nightline.''
   ABC spokesman Arnot Walker said Monday the network is undecided
on further live coverage.
   CBS spokesman Tom Goodman said CBS will cover the Mandela visit
``if news warrants.''
   NBC will carry Mandela's arrival in New York live on the
``Today'' show but hasn't decided whether to cover live his address
to Congress next week, said network spokeswoman Catherine McQuay.
   Mandela makes two appearances Friday on PBS, a live 15-minute

<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino has turned
to a formula once used by her discredited predecessor in order to
revive the ``people power'' spirit that propelled her to office.
   Last week, Mrs. Aquino unveiled plans for a nationwide movement
to channel government, private business and volunteer organizations
to deliver basic services and improve lives of millions of
impoverished Filipinos.
   The plan is to bypass ``traditional politicians'' in Congress
and the bureaucracy. Those institutions have blocked many of the
grandiose plans for reform promised but not delivered by the
4-year-old Aquino government.
   For the movement, Mrs. Aquino chose the name ``Kabisig,'' a
Tagalog word for people locked ``arm-in-arm.'' She cited the spirit
of the 1986 uprising against Ferdinand Marcos, when hundreds of
thousands of Filipinos stood arm-in-arm to block tanks seeking to
crush a military mutiny against the late president.
   ``We're fast-tracking all of Cory's priorities,'' said Transport
Secretary Oscar Orbos, a former congressman and leading figure in
``Kabisig.''
   The Roman Catholic magazine Veritas said ``Kabisig'' was
designed to circumvent ``traditional centers of power'' and the
``sluggish, energy- and time-consuming bureaucracy grown fat and
complacent with inaction.''
   Mrs. Aquino hopes to bring into the movement the social activist
groups, human rights organizations and labor federations that stood
at the forefront of the struggle against Marcos. Those groups have
been largely disillusioned with Mrs. Aquino's failure to institute
reforms after the ``people power'' revolution.
   At the same time, the ``Kabisig'' movement has drawn fire from
pro-Aquino politicians.
   ``There were statements in Cory's speech which made me feel
insecure, forlorn, dejected and rejected,'' said Sen. Rene
Saguisag, a former human rights lawyer and one of Mrs. Aquino's
most loyal Senate supporters.
   Saguisag said the president appeared to be seeking a
rubber-stamp legislature.
   Another pro-Aquino senator, Wigberto Tanada, pointed out that
Marcos himself used the term ``Kabisig'' to describe an
organization he set up in 1985 to muster political support.
   Use of so-called ``non-political'' mass movements is a
time-tested formula for bypassing established parties. After
declaring martial law in 1972, Marcos banned political parties,
then organized various ``grass-roots'' organizations ostensibly to
invigorate and transform Philippine society.
   His most successful venture was the New Society Movement, which
evolved into a mega-party similar to the largely defunct Communist
organizations that once held sway in Eastern Europe.
   For years, Mrs. Aquino has excused the shortcomings of her
administration by claiming that inefficiency was the price of
democracy after 20 years of Marcos' ``tyranny.''
   She pointed proudly to her new constitution and elected,
bicameral legislature as examples of her ``restored democracy.''
Ironically, at a time when surveys show her popularity declining,
Mrs. Aquino is now bypassing those institutions to deliver reforms.
   ``She already has the entire government machinery at her beck
and call,'' wrote columnist Emil Jurado in The Manila Standard.
``What reason would she have...for depending on Cory loyalists and
non-government organizations for the survival of her
administration? Isn't she admitting that her administration is a
failure?''
   Political analysts cite the controversy over land reform as a
watershed in Mrs. Aquino's political strategy.
   As social activists had predicted, Congress watered down
legislation establishing the land reform program. In April,
congressmen blocked confirmation of her agrarian reform secretary,
Florencio Abad, because of his anti-landlord views.
   ``Kabisig is calculated to save the elite from itself, yank
it...out of high living and make it smell the poverty until it
hurts,'' wrote former presidential spokesman Teodoro Benigno in The
Philippine Star. ``She knows that if she heads in the same old
direction with the traditional politicians, her administration is
due for a train crash.''

<TEXT>
   A man who shot and killed a policeman trying
to arrest him for a double murder said he held ``no grudges''
before being put to death in the electric chair in Arkansas' first
execution in 26 years.
   John Edward Swindler, 46, was pronounced dead at 9:05 p.m.
Monday, three minutes after being given 2,300 volts of electricit
in the big oak chair.
   Arkansas became the 14th state to carry out an execution and
Swindler the 130th inmate put to death since the U.S. Supreme Court
in 1976 let states resume use of capital punishment.
   Swindler was condemned for the 1976 murder of Fort Smith
policeman Randy Basnett, who was shot at a gas station while trying
to arrest Swindler for two murders in South Carolina. Swindler was
later convicted of those slayings as well.
   The U.S. Supreme Court denied a stay of execution on Saturday.
   In final remarks dictated in his cell to Roman Catholic
Monsignor John O'Donnell, Swindler said: ``I have no animosity
toward anyone. No grudges.''
   ``I hope this brings to light the injustice of capital
punishment and the need to abolish it,'' he said.
   Swindler's body was to be turned over to O'Donnell for
cremation. Swindler's family didn't want the body.
   ``He has professed that he believes in Satan, and I hope he gets
to see him real soon,'' his brother, Robert E. Swindler of
Lexington, S.C., said recently.
   The last person executed in Arkansas was Charles Franklin
Fields, who was electrocuted in 1964 for rape. R. Gene Simmons,
convicted of killing 16 people, including 14 family members, is
scheduled to be die Monday by injection.
   Because Swindler was sentenced before Arkansas changed its
method of execution from electrocution to injection, he was given a
choice of either method. He left the choice up to authorities, who
selected the method specified in his sentence.
   Shanon Howard, the daughter of Basnett's widow, Cindy, said
after the execution, ``All I can say is justice has been done.''
   ``This is Randy Basnett's day,'' said Randy Manus, who was
selected as a witness to the execution.
   A handful of demonstrators for and against the death penalty
gathered outside the prison as the execution approached, including
several members of the Fort Smith Police Department, some in
T-shirts decorated with a lightning bolt and the slogan ``Turn Out
The Lights, The Party's Over _ John Swindler, 1990.''
   Some of those opposed to the death penalty sang ``Amazing
Grace.''
   When told of Swindler's death, several police officers cheered,
grinned, shook one another's hands. One broke into song.
   On Sunday, about 50 members of Amnesty International held a
26-minute vigil commemorating 26 years without an execution in the
state.
   The human rights group implored Gov. Bill Clinton ``not to end
the decency of the past 26 years by reinstituting this brutish form
of violence.''

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
has told Central American leaders that the United States is
committed to marshaling international aid for their war-battered
region and will not forsake it for Eastern Europe.
   Baker met Monday with the presidents of El Salvador, Nicaragua,
Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica and Panama a day after a Central
American summit produced a sweeping plan for regional economic
integration and development.
   ``Central America is poised as never before to consolidate
democracy and achieve lasting peace and disarmament and create
conditions for growth and opportunity in which all of the peoples
of this region, particularly the poor, can share,'' he said.
   One of the presidents' concerns going into the summit was
whether the region would lose out to Eastern Europe in its bid for
international assistance. Baker said that would not happen.
   ``That's why we are exploring with Japan, the European
Community, Canada and other industrialized democracies ways to give
more support to democracy and development in Central America,'' he
said.
   Baker outlined plans for coordinating aid, trade and investment
during a two-hour breakfast with the presidents. He also met
privately with each one.
   ``I'm here today at the request of President Bush to make it
very clear that the U.S. will continue to be fully engaged, to be
fully supportive of this regional peace process,'' Baker told a
news conference afterward.
   The Central American economic accord grew out of the Nobel
Prize-winning regional peace plan signed in 1987.
   The idea Baker broached is based on the program adopted by 24
Western nations to help Poland and Hungary nurture free-market
systems and democratic institutions. Baker said it was favorably
received.
   Honduran President Rafael Callejas estimated that Central
America will need $2.5 billion in aid over three years to
revitalize its economies, but said the presidents did not discuss
specifics with Baker.
   ``We didn't talk about sums or structures,'' he told a joint
presidential news conference.
   Central American officials have expressed two main concerns
about the program: who would run it, and whether the net effect
will be less U.S. aid.
   They also made it clear they need and welcome help _ but on
their own terms.
   ``We are going to decide what we want, when we want it, under
what conditions and with whom,'' said Nicaraguan Foreign Minister
Enrique Dreyfus.
   Guatemalan President Vinicio Cerezo said Baker assured the
presidents he thinks Central Americans should have a strong say in
aid matters.
   On Sunday, the presidents of El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras,
Guatemala and Costa Rica _ all elected civilians _ signed accords
for joint action on ending the poverty and underdevelopment that
fueled war and revolution in the region for more than a decade.
   The accords call for the creation of a Central American Economic
Community.
   Attending the meetings as an observer was President Guillermo
Endara of Panama, which considers itself part of South America due
to its former ties to Colombia but is thinking of joining the
Central American Economic Community.
   The three-day Antigua meeting was the eighth Central American
summit, but the first to deal almost exclusively with economic
issues. Seven earlier summits focused on the search for peace.
   The 1987 regional peace plan, authored by former Costa Rican
President Oscar Arias, managed to bring about an end to the civil
war in Nicaragua and the February elections in which the leftist
Sandinistas were defeated.
   The Sandinistas were succeeded by the coalition government of
President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro.
   The peace plan was also the catalyst for talks now under way
between the governments of El Salvador and Guatemala and leftist
rebels in these two countries.

   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell
sharply Tuesday, and the dollar closed slightly lower against the
Japanese yen.
   The dollar ended the day at 153.72 yen, down 0.16 from Monday's
close of 153.88 yen. It opened at 153.45 yen, and ranged between
153.43 yen and 153.80 yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average shed 336.42 points, or 1.04
percent, from Monday's close, ending the day at 32,040.38.
   Traders attributed the Nikkei index's decline to an increase in
U.S. interest rates and a big drop in the Dow Jones industrial
average in New York overnight.
   Higher interest rates tends to discourage stock investment.
   ``A rise in the U.S. interest rate largely discouraged investors
here because they have been expecting the opposite movement out of
their expectation for the slowdown in the U.S. economy,'' said
Masahiro Umemori, an analyst with Nomura Securities Co.
   He said the index started recovering at midmorning as market
players were reassured by the relative stability of the Japanese
bond market.
   The price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese government
bond slipped to 87.58 points from Monday's close of 87.65, boosting
the yield to 7.06 percent from 7.045 percent.
   On the foreign exchange market, dollar-yen trading remained
inactive after the U.S. currency opened lower following its
overnight slip on overseas markets.
   ``Compared to dealings between European currencies and the U.S.
dollar, in which the dollar tended to be weaker, the yen-dollar
trading was small,'' said Masato Hayashi, a dealer with the Bank of
Tokyo.

<HEAD>Dutch Police Arrest Fourth IRA Suspect</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHAAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dutch police arrested a fourth
suspected Irish Republican Army terrorist early today after a
manhunt involving more than 135 officers with dogs and helicopters,
police said.
   The suspect was found hiding in a forest and surrendered without
a struggle nine hours after fleeing a police identity check, said
Dutch National Police spokesman Henk Ketelaar.
   Britain's Press Association quoted Belgian police as saying the
man was Paul Hughes, 26, of County Down, Northern Ireland.
   Ketelaar would only give his initials, P.M.H., in line with
Dutch police practice, and say he is an IRA member.
   Police have declined to comment on Dutch press reports that the
four belong to the IRA group believed responsible for the May 28
shooting deaths of two Australian tourists in the southern Dutch
city of Roermond.
   The IRA later said it ``tragically mistook'' the two Australians
for British soldiers.
   The string of events leading to today's arrest began Saturday
when Belgian police arrested an IRA suspect identified as Donna
Maguire. The woman's two companions escaped police custody and fled
across the virtually unguarded Dutch-Belgian border.
   One was arrested hours later in the Netherlands, while the other
was spotted roaming around this border village Monday, still
wearing Belgian police handcuffs.
   Approximately 20 minutes after the arrest of the handcuffed man,
police saw a British-registered car driving down the same village
street and ordered it to stop. The car's driver accelerated at high
speed immediately after being asked to show his papers, and the car
was later found abandoned in a nearby forest.
   Police sealed off the entire village and deployed helicopters
and tracker dogs to search for the driver of what they believed to
be the handcuffed man's getaway car.
   At about 1:45 a.m. today, the man was spotted hiding behind a
tree by a police dog and surrendered. He was not armed, Ketelaar
said.
   Police have identified the other two apprehended IRA suspects as
Gerard Majella Harte, 27, of Northern Ireland, and a man known only
by his alias, Andrew Edward Thornton.
   The outlawed IRA, which seeks to end British rule over Northern
Ireland and unite the province with the Irish Republic, has waged a
decades-long bombing and shooting campaign against British targets
in Northern Ireland, Britain and the European continent.

   Here is a list of some of the worst recent massacres in the
United States. All occurred within one day or the space of a few
days. Serial killings that occurred over a long period of time are
not included.
   _ July 18, 1984: Twenty-one people were fatally shot in a
McDonald's restaurant in San Ysidro, Calif., by James Oliver
Huberty, an out-of-work security guard. Huberty himself was then
killed by a police sharpshooter.
   _ Aug. 1, 1966: Sixteen people were killed in Austin, Texas, by
Charles Whitman; most were hit by sniper fire after he climbed to
the top of a campus tower at the University of Texas. Whitman was
killed by police.
   _ December 1987: Sixteen people, including 14 members of one
family, are killed. The mass slaying is discovered after R. Gene
Simmons Sr. is arrested Dec. 28 in the killings of two people in
Russellville, Ark. A search of his home near Dover uncovers the
remains of 14 family members, who authorities say were killed by
Simmons just before Christmas. Simmons was convicted of capital
murder on two charges May 12, 1988, and sentenced to death.
   _ Aug. 20, 1986: Fourteen people were shot to death at a post
office in Edmond, Okla., by Pat Sherrill, 44, a postal worker who
authorities said was about to be fired. After police sharpshooters
arrived, Sherrill killed himself.
   _ Feb. 19, 1983: Thirteen people were fatally shot in the head
during a robbery at a gambling club in Seattle's Chinatown section.
Willie Mak and Benjamin Ng were convicted of murder.
   _ Sept. 5, 1949: Thirteen people were fatally shot in 12 minutes
in Camden, N.J. Howard Unruh, who told police, ``I'd have killed a
thousand if I'd had enough bullets,'' was found insane and
committed to a mental institution.
   _ Sept. 25, 1982: Twelve people, including five children, were
killed in Wilkes-Barre and Jenkins Township, Pa. George Banks, 43,
was convicted on 12 counts of murder and sentenced to death.
   _ Easter Sunday (March 30), 1975: Eleven people, including eight
children, were killed at a family gathering in Hamilton, Ohio. A
relative, James Ruppert, was convicted of two killings and found
innocent by reason of insanity in nine others.
   _ Palm Sunday (April 15), 1984: Ten people, including eight
children, were killed in a New York City apartment. Christopher
Thomas was convicted of first-degree manslaughter, the judge citing
``extreme emotional disturbance.''
   _ July 14, 1966: Eight student nurses were stabbed or strangled
in a Chicago dormitory. Richard Speck, 24, was convicted of murder.
   _ Sept. 14, 1989: Joseph T. Wesbecker, a 47-year-old pressman on
disability for mental illness, fatally shoots eight people and
wounds 12 others at a printing plant in Louisville, Ky., before
taking his own life.
   _ June 18, 1990: James Edward Pough, 42, walks into a General
Motors Acceptance Corp. office in Jacksonville, Fla., opens fire,
killing eight and commits suicide.
   _ Aug. 20, 1982: school teacher Carl Brown walked into a Miami
machine shop armed with a shotgun and killed eight shop employees
and wounded three others over a $20 welding job. Brown was then
fatally shot by witnesses while riding away in his bicycle.
   _ Feb. 15, 1988: Seven people are killed and five others are
wounded at ESL Corp., a defense contractor in California's
``Silicon Valley.'' A former employee, Richard Wade Farley, 39, is
arrested. He had been fired for harassing a woman who was among the
injured. Charges are pending.
   _ April 14, 1989: A rampage in Sonoma County, Calif., leaves
seven people dead. Ramon Salcido, a former winery worker, is
accused of killing his wife, his two daughters, his mother-in-law,
her two daughters and a co-worker, and attempting to kill three
other people. Charges are pending.
   _ Jan. 17, 1989: Patrick Purdy, a 24-year-old drifter, opens
fire on a Stockton, Calif., schoolyard with a semiautomatic assault
rifle and other weapons. Five children and killed and 30 other
people are wounded. Purdy then committed suicide.

<TEXT>
   Even before he takes office, President-elect
Alberto Fujimori is staking his power and prestige on a high-stakes
quest for international aid.
   The political neophyte sets off this weekend for the United
States, Japan and South Korea on a trip that represents a dramatic
turnabout for Peru.
   Outgoing President Alan Garcia turned his back on the
international financial community. Fujimori, who takes office July
28, wants to bring Peru back into the fold.
   The president-to-be has a powerful motivation for his effort.
   The Peru he will inherit is bankrupt, battered by 2,000 percent
annual inflation. Thousands of Peruvians are on strike and four in
five lack steady work. A 10-year guerrilla war has claimed more
than 18,500 lives.
   If Fujimori succeeds, it won't be the first time he's overcome
long odds.
   His landslide win over famed novelist Mario Vargas Llosa in the
June 10 runoff election capped a come-from-behind campaign. As
Peru's 86th president, he will join the small minority of
democratically elected leaders in the country's 169-year history
since independence.
   Analysts say the survival of Peru's latest 10-year-old stint of
democracy likely hinges on Fujimori. A restless military is ready
to intervene if the government proves unable to keep Peru from
falling into chaos, they say.
   In Washington, where his 12-day tour will start June 25,
Fujimori is to meet officials of the International Monetary Fund,
the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.
   It may be something of a fence-mending mission.
   Garcia, upon coming to power in 1985, limited payment on the
nation's $20 billion foreign debt to 10 percent of export earnings.
Shortly afterward, Peru stopped payment altogether.
   In the first third of this year alone, Peru missed $1.6 billion
in payments to international lending institutions. The amount
overdue to private banks is believed to be even higher.
   Fujimori will travel next to Japan, which has said it is willing
to resume loans to Peru if the country shows a willingness to deal
with its serious social and economic problems.
   Fujimori's Japanese ancestry has raised hopes of greater access
to Japanese aid. Peru was the largest recipient of Japanese aid in
Latin America in cumulative terms until 1988, but dropped to
fourth-largest after it defaulted on payments and Japan cut off its
yen credits.
   One official in Japan's Foreign Ministry said Peru owes Japan an
estimated $1 billion in government and private debts.
   Garcia contended in a recent interview that Peruvian democracy
has survived because he resisted the austerity measures recommended
by the Peru's creditors. But many believe Peru's economy cannot
survive much longer without the drastic measures advocated by
Vargas Llosa.
   Inflation in the first two weeks of June alone was 25 percent.
Central Bank reserves stand at $900 million, mostly in gold and
silver. Liquid reserves are $134 million, enough to pay for less
than two months of imports.
   During the campaign, Fujimori played on worries about Vargas
Llosa's plans for ``economic shock treatment'' and cultivated poor,
indigenous Peruvians who associated the novelist with the
European-descended elite.
   He said the economy could recover with ``gradual'' measures, but
never fully explained what those would be.
   Vargas Llosa planned to privatize most of the chronically
inefficient public enterprises and cut the bloated bureaucracy.
   But in a country where 40 percent of the population lives in
extreme poverty, Vargas Llosa's proposals raised the specter of
greater suffering. Fujimori was the beneficiary of those fears.
   In order to get anything accomplished, Fujimori's government
will have to court support from other parties. But Garcia's
left-leaning Aprista Party opposes austerity measures, and Fredemo,
the center-right coalition that supported Vargas Llosa, is still
feeling the sting of defeat.
   An Aprista leader, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he
expects serious instability if Fujimori fails to forge a broad
consensus in six months or less.
   Since Fujimori is a newcomer in Peruvian politics, he has no
links to traditional parties, and no established base of support.
   But analysts say he may be able to turn that lack of political
connections into an asset when it's time to compromise _ a time
that could come soon.

   The Purdy School Board has reinstated a ban on
school dances after winning a four-year battle that reached the
Supreme Court.
   ``The board wants to go back to the business of running a good
school and have some quiet,'' board attorney Ransom Ellis III said
Monday.
   In 1986, 21 students and parents sued to overturn the ban,
claiming it was imposed for religious reasons and thus violated
separation of church and state.
   The board in the town of about 1,000 argued dances might lead to
drinking and discipline problems.
   The Supreme Court in April upheld the century-old ban by
agreeing with an appeals court that the rule was not motivated by
religious beliefs.
   Ellis said the dance ban was never taken off the books but had
been suspended while the case worked its way to the Supreme Court.
   ``Tonight's vote reinstates the old rule,'' he said.

   Notes and survivors' stories from the
flash flooding in Belmont County that killed at least 21 people and
left 13 missing:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Jennifer Gulash watched homes near The Three Ks, a Wegee
nightspot, drift off their foundations and float away.
   ``We were eating dinner ... and the lights flickered,'' she
said. ``My husband, who works nights and was getting ready to go to
work, said, `You better get some candles _ you're going to be home
alone in the dark.'''
   After the lights went out, she heard people screaming and looked
out to see a couple who lived in a trailer behind the club put
their children in a truck.
   ``I saw them get into the street, then I just saw the water rip
through,'' she said.
   The family she saw made it to high ground in time, she said.

   Tom Allison watched the storm rage through Wegee Creek on
Thursday night and thought nothing of it. He soon changed his mind.
   ``We were in my back yard ... but when the rain started blowing
in, we went inside,'' Allison said Monday. ``We hadn't been inside
five minutes when somebody looked out the back door and said, `Oh,
my God.'
   ``Some people didn't have a chance to see it coming. ... We did,
or we wouldn't have gotten out. It's simple as that,'' he said.
   Allison and his sister, Vicki, who lived nearby, lost everything.
   ``Who would think of flood insurance for a 10-foot wide creek
that never gets over a foot deep?'' Allison said. ``What would you
need flood insurance for?''
   ``But within a half-hour from the time it started raining,
vehicles and houses and trailers were moving down the creek,''
Allison said.
   ``We watched a minute, a minute and a half, and here comes
another building, and it ripped through the pavilion where we had
been sitting.
   ``Then we saw (Ms. Allison's) trailer start to move, and we
decided it was time to get out of Dodge.''
   They fled to higher ground across the road.

   Chuck Vogt, the Belmont County coroner's investigator, stood on
a railroad trestle and watched National Guardsmen and Coast Guard
divers drag a wrecked car from the mouth of Wegee Creek.
   He watched a moment longer and then scratched his head.
   ``You know, we had a mock disaster drill planned for some time
later this month,'' he said. ``I don't think we'll need it now.''

   ``The house can be renovated, gradually,'' said 69-year-old
Warren Wright of Pipe Creek, as he and his daughter, Inez, of
Steubenville, left the disaster information center at the Jefferson
School in Shadyside.
   ``But the vinyl siding is gone, the furniture is gone, my truck
is gone, my workshop is gone, my tool shed is gone and the yard
looks like a battlefield.''
   His voice grew huskier.
   ``I built the home myself, 33 years ago.''
   Wright said he was reading on his bed when the flood struck.
   ``I wasn't worried ... until I received a telephone call saying
a flash flood was coming,'' he said. ``I thought he was pulling my
leg. ... I headed up the road to check on some disabled neighbors.
   ``The creek came up across the road, and I thought, `Well, I
better go back and move some vehicles.' But when I started back I
couldn't get back.''
   Wright said he lost most of his possessions but no family
members.
   ``I still got off lucky,'' he said.

   Three people hijacked a Soviet airliner
on a domestic flight today and the plane landed in Helsinki, where
it was surrounded by police and negotiations began, Finnish air
authorities said.
   The twin-jet Tupolev 154, with 54 passengers and five crew
aboard, had been flying from the Latvian capital Riga to Murmansk
on the northern Kola peninsula when it was hijacked, said Irmeli
Paavola of the Finnish Aviation Authority.
   The three hijackers had demanded to be flown to Stockholm,
according to spokeswoman Malin Engstedt of the rescue service at
Arlanda airport outside the Swedish capital.
   Instead, the plane touched down at Vanda airport outside the
Finnish capital shortly before 11 a.m. and taxied to the side of a
runway. Witnesses said it was surrounded by police.
   In Stockholm, the Swedish national news agency TT quoted Finnish
aviation officials as saying the hijackers had threatened to blow
up the plane during negotiations with Finnish authorities.
   The agency said negotiations were hampered because the hijackers
spoke only Russian. Details were not immediately available on the
hijackers' demands.
   It was the second hijacking in 10 days of a Soviet airliner on a
domestic flight. On June 9, Dimitry Semionov, a 17-year-old Soviet
youth, hijacked a plane with 114 passengers during a flight from
Minsk to Murmansk.
   The plane was forced to fly to Stockholm, where Semionov
surrendered. He said later through a lawyer that he had acted on
impulse after a family quarrel and wanted to go to a ``free
country.''
   Semionov was arraigned in a Stockholm court and could face up to
four years in prison, depending on results of psychiatric tests.

   A new infrared device that measures a car's
exhaust from the side of the road as the vehicle drives past may
someday replace state testing programs in which emissions are
collected from the tailpipe of an idling auto.
   In a test in Illinois, the device showed that 8 percent of
Chicago's autos produce about half the city's carbon monoxide
pollution and that relatively new vehicles as well as old clunkers
are among the worst polluters.
   In Nevada, the Environmental Protection Agency concluded that
the device, called FEAT for Fuel Efficiency Automobile Test, was an
accurate tool.
   Some officials believe the device, invented three years ago by
University of Denver chemistry professor Donald H. Stedman, could
streamline emissions testing and improve pollution control.
   ``Further down the road the ultimate goal is to identify
precisely that relatively small percentage and require them to come
in for inspection and maintenance rather than requiring everyone,''
said Bill Denham of the Illinois Department of Energy and Natural
Resources.
   In the conventional testing station, the emissions are collected
from the tailpipe.
   With FEAT, the infrared beam source and the detector are placed
on opposite sides of a road and take their reading as the car
passes, Stedman said Monday. A computer calculates the emissions,
and a camera snaps a picture of the license plate to determine the
vehicle's age.
   He said the FEAT can measure 1,000 cars an hour. In contrast,
Illinois testing stations typically check 17 vehicles per hour,
said James Matheny of the Illinois Environmental Protection
Agency's Vehicle Emission Testing Program.
   Marc Pitchford, who was in charge of testing the device for the
EPA in Nevada, said roadside testing would save Illinois $12
million a year on its emissions program, which state officials put
at $21 million to $23 million.
   Stedman said hydrocarbon pollution would be reduced by catching
cars that pollute sooner. He said many drivers tamper with their
cars to pass annual emissions tests.
   But the FEAT has its skeptics.
   Matheny said little research exists on how many sensors would be
needed and on where to locate them for thorough testing.
   And Steven Cadle, a research scientist for General Motors who
developed a test similar to Stedman's, said the roadside tests
assume an auto's output remains constant.
   ``I would not feel comfortable writing that person a ticket,''
he added.

   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell
sharply today, mirroring Monday's lower prices on the New York
exchange, while the dollar closed slightly down against the yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average shed 336.42 points, or 1.04
percent, from Monday's close, ending the day at 32,040.38. Volume
on the first section was 330 million shares, compared with 300
million shares Monday.
   The dollar ended the day at 153.72 yen, down 0.16 from Monday's
close of 153.88 yen. It opened at 153.45 yen, and ranged between
153.43 yen and 153.80 yen.
   Masato Hayashi, chief customer dealer at the Bank of Tokyo, said
trading was active on European currencies but dollar trading was
slow while traders ``wait and see.''
   ``People need news about the dollar,'' he said.
   Traders attributed the stock market decline to Monday's lower
close in New York.
   ``The New York market was down, so the Tokyo market fell, too,''
said Kazuyuki Suzuki, a trader at Daiwa Securities, adding that
high money supply figures published in May also have affected
trading.
   Prices for blue-chip stocks and over-the-counter stocks were
both down, following three days of high prices for OTC securities.
``Prices for blue-chip stocks have been down since the beginning of
June,'' said Yoshiro Inoue, a trader at Nomura Securities. Lower
prices signal a cooling-off after a period of feverish trading that
saw high volume and prices, he said.
   On the bond market, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds fell to 87.46 points at closing, down
from Monday's close of 87.65. Their yield rose to 7.085 percent
from 7.045 percent on Monday.

   The state and U.S. governments have filed a
lawsuit that accuses eight companies of toxic dumping in California
waters and takes the unusual step of trying to force industry to
return the area to the way it was.
   The lawsuit, filed Monday in federal court, contends the
companies dumped hundreds of tons of such chemicals as DDT and PCBs
since the mid-1940s, harming fisheries and births of the bald
eagle, peregrine falcon and sea lion.
   Lawyers called the lawsuit unique.
   ``In the past, the state recovered funds for cleanup of ocean
dumping, but there's never been an attempt to collect money to
restore the marine habitat,'' said Michael R. Valentine, an
attorney for the state Lands Commission.
   Targets of the lawsuit are Montrose Chemical Corp., Atkemix 37
Inc., Stauffer Management Co., ICI American Holdings Inc.,
Chris-Craft Industries Inc., Westinghouse Electric Corp., Potlatch
Corp. and Simpson Paper Co.
   State Attorney General John Van de Kamp said the damages could
run in the millions of dollars.
   ``We are encouraging these polluters to accept the
responsibility to clean up the contamination and to restore the
marine environment for future generations,'' said Van de Kamp.
   The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration also
joined the state in the lawsuit.
   Simpson spokeswoman Maureen Frisch said she knew nothing about
the lawsuit.
   Officials for the other companies could not be reached in calls
made after business hours.
   The lawsuit seeks restoration of an approximately 20-mile
stretch of coast from the northern tip of Santa Monica Bay south to
Palos Verdes.
   It was filed under the 1980 Superfund law and the 1972 Clean
Water Act.
   Under the Reagan administration, the Superfund law was
restricted to ``human health concerns.'' It could not be invoked in
cases of damage to natural resources. The Bush administration,
however, restored $2.5 million to pursue litigation that would
force polluters to restore land and wildlife.

   Nelson Mandela is drawing huge
crowds and garnering accolades at every stop on his international
tour. But at home, the reaction ranges from indifference to
criticism.
   Teacher strikes in black schools, the African National Congress'
rivalry with other black groups, and even the troubled marriage of
a black pop singer have all been judged more interesting by the
editors of the Sowetan, the largest black daily newspaper.
   The Sowetan _ based in the Soweto township where Mandela lives _
generally gives close coverage to his activities. But it has not
published a front-page story or picture of his trip since he left
South Africa on June 4.
   Mandela begins an eight-city U.S. visit on Wednesday, when he
will arrive in New York.
   Mandela's repeated calls for continued economic sanctions
against South Africa have drawn criticism from another leading
black newspaper, one that traditionally backs the ANC.
   ``Sanctions cannot be prolonged any longer,'' City Press said in
an editorial Sunday. ``We do not want to inherit a wasteland.''
   The newspaper, South Africa's largest black weekly, argued that
it might be time for a policy reassessment by the ANC: ``In the
light of the government's reform policy, has the time not come for
the ANC to review the use of sanctions as a strategy to end
apartheid?''
   Mandela, released Feb. 11 after more than 27 years in prison,
has received almost daily coverage in white-oriented newspapers and
government-run television.
   Most of the reports have focused on the sanctions issue and what
the publications perceive as uncritical adulation of the ANC leader.
   ``We do not begrudge the Americans their right to fete him,''
said The Citizen, a pro-government daily. ``But we do feel they
should welcome Mr. Mandela, the man, rather than Mr. Mandela, the
legend, the god, the new Christ...''
   Many South Africans _ both black and white _ believe the
country's political and racial conflicts are largely internal
matters that will be decided by South Africans rather than
outsiders.
   That may be the reason that reports about foreigners' response
to Mandela's message has drawn little interest in the country.
   During Mandela's absence from South Africa, however, his
organization appears to have put some major decisions on hold.
   Mid-level government officials and ANC members last month
produced a joint plan designed to clear the way for black-white
negotiations on a new constitution and ending apartheid.
   De Klerk said the government has accepted the plan and is ready
to implement it. The ANC has asked to wait until July 10 before
responding. Mandela is due back in late July.
   De Klerk lifted the state of emergency in most of the country
June 8.
   ``We are on the threshold of the real negotiation process ...
the ANC must now stop vacillating,'' he said then.

<TEXT>
   The parents of an Illinois man kidnapped
while working for a mining company have arrived in Ecuador to try
to win his freedom.
   Roy and Marge Heimdal of Peoria, Ill., were met by U.S. Embassy
officials on their arrival Monday at Quito's international airport.
   The Heimdals refused to talk with reporters about the kidnapping
of their 27-year-old son, Scott. But before boarding a plane in
Chicago, Mrs. Heimdal said, ``I'm not coming back without my son.''
   Meanwhile, court sources in Quito said Heimdal's supervisor had
filed legal papers suggesting a disgruntled former employee of the
IMINCO mining company may be responsible for the April 28
kidnapping.
   For weeks, officials have been saying the kidnapping was the
work of Communist guerrillas.
   Heimdal was kidnapped while traveling on the Bermeja River in
the jungle near Ecuador's border with Colombia. He was working for
IMINCO dredging river bottoms for gold deposits.
   Officials say a band of armed men attacked his boat, killed the
pilot and took Heimdal and an Ecuadoran student hostage. The
student was later released with a ransom demand.
   The Heimdals, a working-class family, gathered $60,000 in
community donations that they believed to be the ransom demand. But
to their dismay, the kidnappers said last week that they were
demanding $612,000.
   On Thursday, the Heimdals made public a four-page letter from
their son. In the letter, he said he was being moved daily in the
Colombian jungle and surviving on armadillo and monkey meat.
   The letter said the kidnappers became angry and believed the
family to be rich after seeing a television report last week about
the fund-raising in Peoria.
   U.S. Embassy officials had said earlier they were concerned that
the wide publicity the kidnapping has received could complicate
negotiations to win Heimdal's freedom and might jeopardize his life.
   The court sources in Quito told The Associated Press that
Jeffrey Fino, IMINCO's general manager, filed a written accusation
with police on May 1, suggesting a former employee may have
instigated the kidnapping.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
documents accuse the man, who had a contract with IMINCO for
transporting mining equipment to the jungle area, had threatened
Fino.
   Fino, who is representing the Heimdal family in the kidnapping
negotiations, was not available Monday to comment. Since last week,
he has not gone to his office, according to his secretary.
   In an interview last week, Fino said he was beginning to fear
the kidnappers were bandits, not guerrillas.
   The kidnappers have identified themselves as members of the
People's Libertion Army, a Communist guerrilla group from Colombia.

   Government troops today shot their way
into an east coast town that had been in Tamil rebel hands and were
sweeping it for mines and booby traps, military officials said.
   Batticaloa, 140 miles northeast of Colombo in this Indian Ocean
island nation, has been a flashpoint in recent fighting in the war
that has grown out of bitter ethnic rivalries.
   Troops moved in from a nearby airstrip and military camp, the
officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Tamil rebels withdrew from the town on Monday into the
surrounding jungles to continue fighting. Military officials said
law and order in the town had broken down and that looting of
stores was widespread.
   Also today, government forces overran Tamil rebel positions in
the east and repulsed an attack on an army garrison in the north,
officials said.
   The army used helicopter gunships and repeated machine-gun fire
to stave off an early morning attack by rebels on the Jaffna
military garrison, said military officials, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   Jaffna, 190 miles north of Colombo, is headquarters to the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the main rebel milita.
   The officials said the rebels used bulldozers and heavy
earth-moving equipment in their bid to seize the 200-year-old Dutch
fort, where the garrison is located. About 150 soldiers were in the
garrison at the time, they said.
   In the east, government police commandos overran two rebel camps
and freed 75 people who had been held captive, the officials said.
Eight-day-old rebel sieges of two military camps near the town of
Batticaloa were broken when army reinforcements crossed swamps and
jungles to reach the area, they said.
   There were no details of casualties in the latest fighting, but
Deputy Defense Minister Ranjan Wijeratne said Monday that 600
rebels had been killed since June 11. He did not speak of
government casualties.
   In addition, at least 378 people are reported to have been
killed. The figure includes at least 137 unarmed policemen said to
have been massacred by the rebels. The death toll was compiled from
reports by witnesses, military officials and rebel sources.
   The fighting began June 10 after Tiger rebels overran police
stations in the Tamil-dominated northern and eastern provinces,
ending a year-long cease-fire with security forces.
   Two further attempts during the week to stop the fighting broke
down.
   Tamil rebels have been fighting for an independent nation since
1983, claiming their minority community is being discriminated
against by the Sinhalese, who control the army and the government.
   In May 1989, the rebels agreed to a cease-fire with the
government.
   Ten months later, Indian peacekeeping soldiers who had tried in
vain to disarm the rebels over 32 months, withdrew from Sri Lanka.
That left the rebels in control of most major towns in the north
and east.
   At least 11,000 people, including 1,100 Indian soldiers, have
been killed in the war.
   The government and the rebels began talks on the political
future of the regions but the talks had not made much headway
before the fighting resumed.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of the island's 16 million people and
Sinhalese comprise 75 percent.

<HEAD>Rebels Reject Government Amnesty Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of the rebel delegation
to Liberian peace talks has rejected the government's offer of a
general amnesty that would let the insurgents set up their own
political party.
   Thomas Woewiyu, interviewed Monday night, also reiterated the
rebel demand that President Samuel Doe leave the West African
country.
   The Liberian leader announced two weeks ago he would not stand
for re-election. But he has refused to resign immediately, saying
it would leave a dangerous power vacuum during the conflict.
   On Monday, Doe lifted a ban on several opposition political
parties and said the National Patriotic Front rebels could set up a
party with no fear of reprisals.
   ``Doe has no authority to grant anybody amnesty. He is not in a
position to grant amnesty. He can only grant himself amnesty,''
Woewiyu said.
   The two sides adjourned talks Saturday for a week. The rebel
delegation signed an agreement urging both sides to exercise
restraint during the recess and calling for mutual inspections of
troop and supply movements.
   Fighting had virtually ceased before the talks began.
   The church-mediated negotiations got under way in neighboring
Sierra Leone after Liberian government forces inflicted their first
major defeat on the rebels since they invaded from neighboring
Ivory Coast on Dec. 24.
   In that fighting, rebels were driven from the Firestone rubber
plantation and neighboring international airport 35 miles from
Monrovia after their chief military commander was killed in a
skirmish.
   Woewiyu said the restraint agreement ``applies more to Doe's
extramilitary activities, his death squads chopping off people's
heads and throwing away their bodies _ that has nothing to do with
a cease-fire.''
   Survivors who have fled rebel-controlled territory say the
insurgents also committed atrocities. Reporters who have visited
them saw the skulls of dead Liberian soldiers stuck on stakes along
the roadside.
   The talks, mediated by the Liberian Council of Churches, were to
resume June 25.
   Woewiyu said the rebels accepted the recess to give Doe time to
flee.
   ``It is Doe who needs an amnesty and he better take it now
before it is too late,'' he said.
   Doe took power in a violent 1980 coup that ousted descendants of
the freed American slaves who founded Liberia in 1847. They
historically monopolized power and discriminated against indigenous
Liberians in their country of 2.5 million residents.

   A researcher was awarded this year's
World Food Prize for developing a strain of potato resistant to the
blight that caused Europe's Great Potato Famine in the mid-19th
century.
   John S. Neiderhauser, 74, dubbed ``Mr. Potato,'' was named the
fourth winner Monday of the $200,000 prize designed to reward
research in production or distribution of food.
   He developed a strain of potato resistant to late blight
disease. The strain is credited with at least doubling yields.
   ``His achievements toward developing a blight-resistant potato
variety have affected countries from Mexico to Bangladesh,'' said
Norman Borlaug, founder of the prize. ``Without a doubt, Dr.
Niederhauser's discoveries have had a dramatic impact on the
food-deficient regions of the world.''
   ``Today, the annual increase in world potato production is
greater than that of any other crop,'' said Borlaug, winner of the
1970 Nobel Peace Prize for his research fostering the ``green
revolution'' in developing nations.
   Neiderhauser, an American with a doctorate from Cornell
University in New York, has done much of his work overseas. He
founded the International Potato Center in Lima, Peru, in 1971 and
worked for agricultural research foundations in Mexico and Poland.
   Currently, he is based in Phoenix, where he works as a
consultant for Biosphere II, a research program attempting to
develop a system in which food could be produced in a closed
environment. Such technology could be useful on long space flights,
he said.
   General Foods Inc. established the prize in 1986. But Kraft
General Foods, established last year after Philip Morris Companies
bought Kraft Inc. and merged it with General Foods, announced in
December it was withdrawing funding. The company did not explain
why.
   Prize officials announced Monday that beginning next year, the
state of Iowa and private foundations headed by Des Moines
businessman John Ruan will sponsor the prize, which costs $600,000
annually to research and administer.

<HEAD>Raymond Huntley, Actor Who Debunked Pompous Officialdom, Dead at
86</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Raymond Huntley, who specialized in comedy
roles debunking pompous officialdom in a career on the stage, in
movies and on television, has died. He was 86.
   One of his best-known roles was that of Sir Geoffrey Dillon, the
crusty family lawyer in the British TV series ``Upstairs,
Downstairs,'' made from 1970 to 1975.
   Huntley died Friday in London's Westminster hospital. No cause
of death was stated in the family's announcement Monday.
   Huntley was seldom the star of any show but his performances as
a supporting actor were noted for their polish and professionalism.
He made his first stage appearance in 1922 in Birmingham, the
industrial city in central England where he was born.
   A tall man with a mustache, Huntley during his long career
played judges, bank managers, churchmen, bureaucrats and other
figures of authority.
   He could play them straight if necessary but in comedy his
natural dryness of delivery was exaggerated to the point where the
character he was playing invited mockery as a pompous humbug.
   His role as the bank manager in the 1949 movie ``Passport to
Pimlico'' launched him as a noted film comedy actor.
   His other movies included the sharply satirical farce ``I'm
Alright Jack'' by the film-making brothers John and Roy Boulting in
1959 about Britain's disastrous industrial relations at that time;
``Room at the Top'' in 1958; and ``Hostile Witness'' in 1968.
   Apart from ``Upstairs, Downstairs,'' his television work
included his own series, ``Uncle Charles,'' in which he played a
bachelor uncle, and ``That's Your Funeral,'' a comedy about a firm
of morticians.
   His marriage to June Bell was dissolved. Funeral arrangements
were not announced.

   The 13 charged they were the target of physical and verbal

   Somali authorities have arrested more than
40 people for distributing what the government says are seditious
pamphlets criticizing President Mohamed Siad Barre's rule.
   The arrests were announced Monday by Ahmad Sulayman Abdallah,
deputy secretary general of the ruling Somali Revolutionary
Socialist Party party. Twenty-one other people were released after
proving they had nothing to do with the leaflets.
   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights group, last
week claimed that up to 50 prominent people, including the
country's former president, had been arrested for signing a
statement titled ``Mogadishu Manifesto No. 1.''
   The statement, signed by more than 100 people and issued May 15,
expressed concern at the destruction, killings and flow of refugees
from Somalia's civil war, Amnesty International said. It said the
statement also criticized the government for violations of human
rights, corruption and economic mismanagement.
   Abdallah's announcement, broadcast on state-run Somali radio and
monitored in Nairobi, said authorities were holding more than 40
people for distributing inside and outside the East African nation
leaflets ``claiming to advise the president.''
   He described them as ``power seekers'' whose aim was to create
discord between the people and the government. He did not say when
the leaflets first were distributed.

<TEXT>
   A fugitive right-wing leader
has declared war on the government, releasing a videotape from
hiding in which he promises to ``use every means at our disposal''
to overthrow President F.W. de Klerk.
   Police offered a $19,000 reward today for the arrest of Piet
Rudolph, the deputy leader of the extreme right-wing Boer State
Party.
   A spokeswoman, Lt. Nina Barkhuizen, said police had studied
Rudolph's videotape, which was received in the mail Monday by a
radio station and the Afrikaans-language newspaper Beeld.
   Government officials said the threat could incite violence as
the government negotiates to end apartheid. There was no indication
of the degree of support for Rudolph's call, but several right-wing
white groups have warned the government that they would use force
to preserve their privileges under the system of racial segregation.
   ``There is no time to plan a counterrevolution. It is now open
war,'' Rudolph said in the 20-minute videotape, flanked by four
masked men armed with machine guns.
   ``We will use every means at our disposal to fight the de Klerk
government, the overthrow of which is the highest priority to us.''
   Rudolph made his statement in Afrikaans, the language of the
Dutch-descended whites who run the government. It was translated by
the independent South African Press Association.
   Rudolph is wanted by the police in the theft of arms and
ammunition from air force headquarters in Pretoria on April 13.
   In a statement announcing the reward, Minister of Law and Order
Adriaan Vlok said: ``South Africa can't allow people like Mr.
Rudolph to rouse emotions with instigating threats.''
   ``He is flagrantly and absolutely irresponsibly rousing emotions
that can lead to serious incidents of violence,'' Vlok said.
   He said people who threaten violence, whether from the left or
the right, are ``steering people closer to a bloody confrontation.''
   In the tape, Rudolph identified ``the enemy'' as de Klerk, the
African National Congress and the Communist Party. De Klerk
legalized the two left-wing groups in February. They had been
banned in South Africa for 30 years.
   De Klerk has pledged to negotiate a new constitution that would
give the black majority a vote in national affairs.
   Also today, the Communist Party announced plans to formally
re-launch the organization and maintain its close alliance with the
ANC.

<HEAD>Mexico's President Says His Economic Policies Win Japanese Help</HEAD>

   Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gotari said
today that Japanese interest in helping Mexico solve environmental
problems and build its economy were due to his nation's strict
economic policies.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said Monday that Japan would
provide more than $800 million in credits to help Mexico fight
pollution and improve its railways.
   They include $453 million for a heavy oil desulfurization
project, $315 million for a refinery for lead-free gasoline and $40
million for the Mexican national railways locomotive rehabilitation
project.
   Mexico City's pollution, among the worst in the world, is
particularly bad because of the nation's almost exclusive use of
leaded gasoline.
   In a speech today before the Japan National Press Club, Salinas
said the Japanese were receptive to investing in Mexico and that
there were specific plans for 30 projects.
   He said Japan's largest investment banker, Nomura Securities,
was negotiating with a Spanish bank and Mexico to offer a portfolio
of Mexican issues known as the ``Mexican Fund'' on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Salinas attributed Japanese interest in the Mexican market to
what he called his country's successful and consistent economic
policies.
   Mexico has brought its deficit to about 6 percent of the gross
domestic product and reduced inflation from more than 200 percent
to less than 20 percent, Salinas said.
   As a result, he said, ``Confidence has been strengthened,
capital has been repatriated, foreign investment has increased
substantially and domestic interest rates have dropped.''
   Salinas planned to leave Japan Wednesday for Singapore and
Australia. His wife and three children, who attend a private school
in Mexico that emphasizes Japanese studies, were to remain in Japan
through Sunday.

   Moslem militants today fired rockets at
three lakeside hotels used to house security forces, killing at
least two paramilitary soldiers and wounding nine, officials said.
   It was the militants' first use of rockets since their campaign
for independence turned violent in January.
   Militants launched the rockets in a pre-dawn attack from a boat
on Dal Lake, officials said on condition of anonymity.
   The officials said two hotels were extensively damaged and a
third was slightly damaged in the attacks, which led to a gunbattle
between militants and security forces.
   A man claiming to represent a new militant organization, the
Moslem Martyr Force, telephoned local journalists to claim
responsibility for the attacks.
   The hotels were being used to bille
   Minutes after the pre-dawn attack, security forces opened fire
toward the lake, a popular tourist spot. The firing continued for
about 15 minutes but the militants escaped, the officials said.
   Earlier news reports said the fighting lasted 90 minutes.
   At least 575 people have since been killed in the fighting in
Srinagar and surrounding areas of the Kashmir valley.
   The valley forms part of Jammu-Kashmir state, the only one of
India's 25 states with a Moslem majority. The valley has been
disputed between India and neighboring Pakistan since both were
born out of the 1947 division along religious lines of the
British-ruled subcontinent.
   Moslem militants at first demanded union with Islamic Pakistan.
But, of late, they have been agitating for independence and the
status of a neutral nation.
   India accuses Pakistan of fomenting the rebellion, a charge
Pakistan has denied. On Monday, India agreed to high-level talks
with Pakistan in an attempt to defuse the crisis and fears of war
between the two countries.
   In Pakistan on Monday, however, militant Kashmiris declared a
government-in-exile to advance their Moslem secessionist movement
in the disputed region.
   The move complicated already tense relations between the two
countries. Their governments agreed Monday to talks aimed at easing
the threat of war over Kashmir.
   Amanullah Khan, chairman of the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front,
announced the government-in-exile at a news conference in
Muzzaffarabad, capital of Pakistan-held Kashmir. His front is one
of the key groups behind the uprising in Jammu-Kashmir state.

<HEAD>Another `Zodiac?': Police Probe Letters For Link to Three
Shootings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Letters sent to two news organizations by
someone claiming to be the ``Zodiac'' have police investigating
whether three non-fatal shootings may be connected, according to a
published report today.
   A letter to the New York Post, with a drawing of a circle carved
out with three astrological signs, describes three shootings in New
York City since March 8.
   However, the letter doesn't appear to be similar to those sent
by San Francisco's infamous ``Zodiac'' killer, the newspaper said.
   From 1968 to 1987, someone calling himself ``The Zodiac''
claimed responsibility for as many as 40 killings in notes sent to
San Francisco-area newspapers. The case is unsolved.
   ``This is the Zodiac,'' begins the letter to the Post postmarked
June 4. ``The twelve sign will die when the belts in the heaven are
seen.''
   A similar letter was sent to the CBS news program ``60
Minutes,'' whose staffers turned it over to police, police said.
   Police said a note found near one victim said: ``This is the
Zodiac.''
   ``I don't know what I have yet,'' Chief of Detectives Joseph
Borelli said.
   ``If we have a person going around shooting people, I'm worried.
We're obviously dealing with someone seeking publicity,'' Borelli
said.
   The shootings occurred March 8, March 29 and May 31 _ two in the
same Brooklyn neighborhood and one an adjoining neighborhood in
Queens, police said. All three victims survived; one, a 78-year-old
man, is still hospitalized, the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
   East German police have arrested yet another
alleged Red Army Faction terrorist, a suspect in the 1981 bombing
of a U.S. air base and the ninth reputed member of the group
captured in less than two weeks.
   East Germany's interior minister said a tip from a former member
of the country's now-disbanded Stasi secret police had led police
to Henning Beer, 31.
   It has been widely believed that the secret police helped
fugitive members of the left-wing West German terror group resettle
in the East, where they were harbored by the hard-line Communist
government.
   The same tip that snared Beer led authorities to Silke
Maier-Witt, whose arrest was announced late Monday, Interior
Minister Peter-Michael Diestel told reporters in East Berlin.
   Maier-Witt and Beer were both captured on Monday in the East
German city of Neubrandenberg, he said. Both had been living and
working under false names.
   The wave of arrests has led to fears of reprisal by the leftist
terror gang Red Army Faction.
   Diestel said that since the arrests started on June 6, his
office has received up to five anonymous death threat letters per
day aimed at him, Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere and others.
   He said there were no indications that East Germany was used as
a base of operations for attacks in the West, but that harboring
West German terrorists was the ``personal hobby'' of former
Communist leader Erich Honecker and his ousted security chief,
Erich Mielke.
   Beer is suspected in the 1981 bombing of the Ramstein Air Base,
which seriously injured 17 people, said Hans-Juergen Foerster, a
spokesman for the West Germany federal prosecutor's office. Red
Army Faction member Helmut Pohl has already been convicted in the
Ramstein bombing.
   In addition, Beer has been charged in a bungled bombing attempt
in the Spanish city of Cadiz in June 1988, Foerster said.
   The Red Army Faction has been waging attacks against NATO, U.S.
and West German industrial targets since the early 1970s. Among
those killed were a U.S. Army officer and leading West German
bankers and industrialists.
   About two dozen members of the Red Army Faction's old guard are
at large.
   Ms. Maier-Witt, 40, is wanted in the 1977 kidnap-slaying of West
German industry chief Hans-Martin Schleyer, and an attempted rocket
attack that same year against West Germany's federal prosecutor's
office.
   The first of the recent arrests occurred June 6, when East
German officials announced the apprehension in East Berlin of
Susanne Albrecht.
   The 39-year-old suspect is also wanted in the Schleyer case and
for the 1977 killing of prominent Dresdner bank chief Juergen Ponto.
   A week later, officials arrested Inge Viett, 46, in the East
German city of Magdeburg. Ms. Viett has been linked to the murder
of prominent West Berlin Judge Guenter von Drenkmann in 1974, and
the shooting death of a French policeman in 1981.
   On June 15, authorities announced the arrest of four more
suspected terrorists in the East German cities of Frankfurt an der
Oder and Cottbus.
   They have been identified as Monika Helbing, 36, Ekkehard von
Seckendorff-Gudent, 39, Werner Lotze, 38, and Christine Duemlein,
41.
   Ms. Helbing and Lotze have also been linked to the Schleyer case.
   Ms. Duemlein was released shortly after her arrest because the
warrant against her expired in 1985. West German officials said it
would not be renewed.
   On June 16, officials arrested Red Army Faction suspect Sigrid
Sternebeck, 40, who is wanted in the 1985 shooting death of U.S.
Army Spec. 4 Edward Pimental. Sternebeck allegedly lured the
soldier out of a discotheque near Wiesbaden to steal his
identification card.
   The identification card was used the next day to plant a car
bomb at the headquarters building of the U.S. Air Force's
Rhine-Main Air Base. Two more Americans were killed in the Aug. 8,
1985, blast and 20 people were injured.
   Both Sternebeck and Albrecht have told investigators they were
provided help and new identification by East German secret police,
the East German news agency ADN reported.

<HEAD>Prime Minister's Aide Reprimanded for Stock Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An aide to Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu offered to
resign after Kaifu reprimanded him for engaging in stock deals last
year, an official said today.
   Aide Mitsuo Ando offered his resignation on Monday, said Shozen
Kaneishi, Kaifu's private secretary. Kaneishi said he would decide
whether Ando should leave after further investigation.
   Ando said Kaifu harshly reprimanded him for the stock deal. Ando
said he did not believe the deal was corrupt but that it was poorly
timed in light of the Recruit stock scandal.
   Kaifu, who has carefully sought to maintain his own clean
reputation, was named prime minister Aug. 9 after the Recruit and
sex scandals forced his two immediate predecessors to resign.
   The stock scandal involved the Recruit Co. information-services
conglomerate, which made large donations and questionable stock
sales to leading politicians and businessmen.
   Investigators said the practice amounted to influence-peddling,
and 12 politicians, public officials and corporate executives were
indicted on bribery charges.
   Members of Kaifu's Cabinet and other high-ranking parliamentary
officials agreed to refrain from dealing in stocks, real estate and
golf course memberships. That restriction apparently also applies
to top politicians' aides, who played a key role in questionable
stock deals in the Recruit affair.
   Ando confirmed a report in the mass-circulation Asahi Shimbun
that he had bought 8,000 shares in Meitech, a firm specializing in
hiring out computer engineers.
   He said the transaction was worth nearly $194,000. When Ando
bought Meitech shares, the stocks were traded at $24 per share. Now
they cost $40.
   ``I bought the shares on the recommendation of a securities
firm, because I thought (Meitech) was a good company,'' Ando said.
``I have about 20 years of experience in stock trading and used my
own funds, from sales of other shares, and plan to keep the shares
five or six years,'' he said.
   ``There's absolutely nothing to be ashamed of, like insider
trading or anything. But while at the time I didn't see anything
wrong with the deal, now I realize it was careless of me, given the
timing,'' he said.

   If students at Simon Lake Elementary
School leave home without it, they won't be able to say ``charge
it'' when it comes time for a power lunch of soup, sandwich and
milk.
   The school is taking part in a pilot program being tested in
Milford and West Hartford to allow the use of ``debit cards''
instead of cash to pay for lunch in the cafeteria.
   Milford Food Service Director Edward Huff and computer companies
introduced the cards two months ago. The debit cards resemble
automatic bank tellers cars and have proved popular.
   ``This is a tremendous time saver. Collecting money from pupils
each day is a very cumbersome task that takes valuable time away
from the teaching,'' Huff said.
   Under the old system, teachers had to record which pupils paid
for lunch and how many were absent. With the cards, teachers
collect money in advance and that information is sent into a
computer system.
   The students insert the card into a little machine that lights
up red, green or yellow to tell students how much money they have
left to spend.
   One student, first-grader Guy Duarte, said there is a potential
for embarrassment. ``I think it's dumb because what if your ticket
shows up red?'' Guy said. ``You don't get lunch. That would be
awful.''
   But Huff said if the system showed any pupils had run out of
money, they would still get lunch.
   Janet Bantley, school lunch coordinator for the state Board of
Education, praised the new system, saying it not only offers
greater accountability, but guarantees the privacy of children on
assistance programs.
   Huff said he expects the debit cards will be in all 12 of the
city's elementary schools within the next two years.

<HEAD>House Arrest For Israeli Arab Poet In Unusual Crackdown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge said poems by an Israeli Arab incited
violence and today placed him under house arrest. It was one of the
strongest steps against an Arab citizen during the 30-month-old
Palestinian uprising.
   Israel radio said the judge also ordered that any poetry by
Shafik Habib be submitted to the military censor before publication.
   Habib, a 49-year-old accountant, said in a telephone interview
that ``police were trying to set a precedent. We are in a
democratic country. There should be freedom of expression.''
   He called the action ``a very serious move against an Arab
intellectual.''
   An Arab legislator demanded a parliamentary debate on the action
against the poet. ``This regime is very weak if they are afraid of
words,'' legislator Abdul Wahab Darousha said in a telephone
interview.
   Jamal Kawwar, chairman of the Palestinian Israeli Writers'
Union, said Habib was the first Israeli Arab citizen to be arrested
for his writings.
   Most punitive measures by Israel during the uprising have
involved the 1.7 million Palestinians who live under military rule
in the occupied West Bank or Gaza Strip. The 810,000 Arabs who live
within Israel's boundaries have the full rights of citizens.
   A military court has sentenced a Palestinian journalist and
writer, Samaan Khoury, to 45 months in jail after he was convicted
of being an uprising leader active in a Syrian-backed Palestine
Liberation Organization faction, military officials said today.
   Khoury, who is from east Jerusalem and a supporter of the
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, is not an Israeli
citizen. He was accused of writing some of the leaflets espousing
violence in the uprising against occupation.
   He also received a suspended term of 39 months after a yearlong
trial that ended Thursday, the officials said.
   The action against Habib came in the Acco Magistrate's Court,
where Judge Eitan Magen put him under house arrest after he was
charged with identifying with an unspecified terrorist group
because of his poetry.
   The domestic news agency Itim quoted the charges as saying
Habib's poems encouraged readers to violence ``liable to bring
about death or injury.'' It said Habib's passport was seized and he
was ordered to pay a $5,000 bond.
   Magen said Habib must remain in his home in Deir Hanna near Acco
until further hearings could be held on a police request to jail
him until his trial. No trial date was set.
   Habib was jailed on June 13 and then released today by the judge
before being placed under house arrest.
   The arrest came at a time when more of Israel's Arab citizens
have taken part in uprising-related demonstrations, mostly in the
aftermath of a May 20 massacre of Arab workers by an Israeli gunman
near Tel Aviv.
   The Maariv daily said the action against Habib came after a
collection of his poems were confiscated from a Palestinian in the
West Bank city of Ramallah.
   Police claimed the poems called for attacks on Israel using
firebombs, stones and even live ammunition, the newspaper said.
   Habib disputed the claim of incitement.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip today, a Palestinian accused of
collaborating with Israel was gunned down by masked assailants as
he rode in a taxi, Arab reports said.
   The victim, Mahmud Abu Harb, 35, was shot in the head in Rafah,
and masked youths later spray-painted the town's walls with slogans
denouncing Abu Harb as a ``traitor.''
   Harb's death raised to 224 the number of Palestinians killed by
fellow Arabs for similar allegations in the 30-month uprising. At
least 717 other Palestinians have been killed by Israelis, and 45
Israelis have been slain by Palestinians.

   The government of President-elect Ion
Iliescu today announced the arrest of two more opposition leaders
in its continuing crackdown on dissent.
   The wife of another detained opposition figure sought refuge at
the Dutch ambassador's home, and a Dutch official said ``we will
not ask her to leave.''
   Authorities appeared to be adopting a a two-pronged tactic of
talking to opposition groups while detaining their leaders. Foreign
governments, including the United States, have criticized the way
Romania has handled protests.
   The Interior Ministry today said it had arrested opposition
figures Dumitru Dinca and Nica Leon, leader of the small National
Democratic Party.
   The two were being held as part of an investigation into the
53-day anti-government protest on University Square that
club-wielding riot police broke up on Wednesday.
   On Monday, authorities detained Marian Munteanu, a student
leader severely beaten by pro-government miners last week. Munteanu
was removed from his hospital bed to an Interior Ministry hospital
on charges of instigating violence.
   Wednesday's crackdown by police triggered rioting that ended the
next day when coal miners called in by Iliescu cleared the city
center, beating with clubs and iron bars anyone they suspected of
being a government opponent.
   The vigilantes also sacked the offices of opposition parties and
shut down opposition newspapers.
   Munteanu's wife, Claudia, sought refuge at the home of Dutch
Ambassador Coen Stork, The Netherlands Embassy said.
   ``She has been at the residence of the ambassador since
yesterday evening because she fears for her safety,'' said Charge
d'Affaires Kaas Vran Spronsam by telephone.
   Asked how long she would be able to stay, the diplomat replied:
``We will not ask her to leave.''
   Government opponents seek the ouster of Iliescu and the other
former Communists who hold top posts in the National Salvation
Front, which took power in the December revolution and won election
by a landslide last month.
   On Monday, the opposition newspapers said they would resume
publishing. The opposition Romania Libera daily, last published
Thursday and often hard to buy, was not on the streets today. But
its editors said it appeared.
   Student activists were targeted last week by the miners in what
was the worst street unrest since the December revolt that toppled
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. Six people were killed and more than
500 injured in the violence, and the government said more than
1,000 were arrested.
   The Interior Ministry said its chief, Doru Viorel Ursu, was
holding talks with student groups. But at the same time, Prime
Minister Petre Roman said government forces ``had the
responsibility and obligation'' to crack down on dissent.
   Parliament's lower house on Monday gave police and soldiers the
authority to clear from University Square anti-government
protesters who had reassembled there beginning Sunday.
   Most dispersed Monday night, and the square was quiet today.
   In the 377-member House of Deputies, only 72 voted against
Monday's motion to have ``the forces of law and order'' end the
demonstration in the square. The vote split along party lines, with
the National Salvation Front in favor backed by splinter parties,
and the three main opposition parties abstaining or voting ``no.''
Passage was virtually certain in the Senate, where the Front also
holds a majority.
   In a separate measure, the 114 senators present Monday voted for
government and police to ``take immediate measures ... to sanction
firmly all those who trespassed and will trespass'' on public
property.
   However, the Senate also passed a motion critical of the
``excesses that consisted of roughing up people and damaging
political party headquarters and public institutions.''
   Iliescu's inauguration, scheduled for last week, was postponed
amid the turmoil.

<HEAD>Eight Companies Sued for Allegedly Polluting California Coast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal and state officials have sued eight
California companies on grounds that they have been polluting
waters and damaging marine life off Los Angeles and Long Beach
since the 1940's, the government announced today.
   The Justice Department filed the suit on behalf of the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Interior Department and
the State of California, NOAA said.
   NOAA said four of the companies named in the suit were Montrose
Chemical Corp., Westinghouse Electric Corp., Stauffer Chemical
Corp. and Potlatch Corp. The others were not immediately identified.
   The suit alleges that the companies dumped the pesticide DDT and
polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCB's, into Los Angeles and Long
Beach harbors, onto the Palos Verdes Shelf off Whites Point and at
two dump sites in the San Pedro Channel near Santa Catalina Island.
   Fish, marine mammals and sea birds were injured, NOAA said.
   The businesses could be required under federal Superfund
legislation to pay tens of millions of dollars to restore damage to
natural resources and habitat. They could also be required to
remove or treat contaminated underwater sediments, restock fish or
install artificial reefs.
   The firms were informed in January of the government's intention
to sue. A 90-day extension of the time in which they could be sued
was negotiated in March. It expired today.
   NOAA said the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts, another
potential defendant, signed a time extension giving the government
until next April to decide whether to sue.
   NOAA said its biologists have found that both commercial and
sports fish off Los Angeles have high levels of DDT and PCB's.
Particularly, the agency said, bottlenose dolphins and California
sea lions have the highest body fat concentrations of those two
chemicals of any marine mammal it has ever studied.

   The silent gunman who killed eight

Monday at a General Motors Acceptance Corp. office.
   The day laborer from Jacksonville began firing a semiautomatic
rifle almost immediately after entering the large one-room office.
He shot two customers, then went desk to desk, shooting at
employees cowering underneath.
   Seven employees and one customer, ages 30 to 45, were killed.
Six victims were women.
   ``The shots kept coming closer and I kept hearing the moans of
people I know,'' said Rick Langille, a loan manager. ``The guy was
pointing his gun under people's desks and killing them one by one.
I just saw the bottom of the carpet and just prayed.''
   Sheriff James McMillan said Pough has also been identified by
witnesses as the killer of a man and woman in separate shootings on
Sunday. The victims, ages 39 and 30, were killed with the same
.30-caliber rifle used Monday, he said.
   The shootings Sunday occurred near Pough's home, and at least
one stemmed from arguments over ``services of a prostitute,''
McMillan said. He did not elaborate. Before Monday's rampage, Pough
was not a suspect in the Sunday shootings.
   The sheriff also said investigators were trying to determine
where and how Pough got his guns. Pough had been charged with
manslaughter in 1971 and pleaded guilty to a lesser felony.
   Generally, felons may not own firearms. But under an agreement,
Pough's record was to be wiped clean at the end of the five years
if he obeyed the terms of probation.
   A records check showed Pough successfully completed probation,
Asa Higgs, a police spokesman, said today. Authorities were
checking to confirm that the conviction had been removed as
provided for in the agreement. But apparently, ``he does not
qualify as a convicted felon,'' Higgs said.
   GMAC said it had repossessed Pough's 1988 Pontiac Grand Am in
January.
   Whether the repossession was Pough's only motive for the
massacre ``we just don't know,'' the sheriff said.
   The gunman never said a word, GMAC employees told police and
counselors called in after the two-minute shooting rampage. About
80 people worked in the one-story building.
   ``He just shot until he saw no one else to shoot,'' McMillan
said.
   Pough used a clip-fed semiautomatic rifle for the shootings,
then turned a .38-caliber revolver on himself, authorities said.
   ``There's numerous magazines, plus numerous rounds in his
pockets,'' said Deputy Ken Bozeman. ``He was loaded for war.''
   The death toll equaled the worst shooting rampage in Florida
history, a 1982 massacre at a Miami machine shop where nine died
and three were wounded.
   Of those injured Monday, four were in critical condition and one
was in serious condition this morning. Some were shot seven or
eight times, officials said.
   ``I had to keep stepping over bodies to give victims CPR,'' said
sheriff's patrolman Steve Dubberly. ``It's the worst slaughter I've
ever seen in my life.''
   Pough's revolver was registered in 1979, McMillan said. Federal
agents were checking whether the rifle was registered.
   A 9mm semiautomatic pistol registered to Pough was found in his
car outside of the building, McMillan said. He also had a
registered .357-caliber, but no information was given on that
weapon's location.
   In addition to his 1971 arrest, the sheriff said, Pough was
arrested in 1968 ``for dangerously displaying a weapon.''

<DATELINE>CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roy McDonald, publisher of the
Chattanooga News-Free Press, died in his sleep early today, family
members said. He was 88.
   McDonald, who started the paper in 1933 as a weekly shopper
called the Chattanooga Free Press, commonly put in eight- to
10-hour days at the News-Free Press, even into his 80s, checking
ads, news copy and story layout. He had worked Monday, the day
before he died.
   He was known as ``Mr. Roy'' to his staff, his colleagues, his
family and to the city.
   The Free Press went daily in 1936, and three years later
McDonald bought the financially troubled Chattanooga News to create
the current newspaper. The paper now has a joint operating
agreement with The Chattanooga Times.
   McDonald was also a major force in Chattanooga business and
civic affairs, serving on the board at Erlanger Medical Center and
helping create Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Tennessee.
   He was born Nov. 25, 1901, in Graysville, Tenn.
   As a young man, he managed grocery stores for his father before
founding a grocery chain called the Homes Stores in 1924. The chain
grew to more than 70 stores in the Chattanooga area before he sold
it in 1967.
   The afternoon News-Free Press and the morning Times published
jointly until 1966, when McDonald began a Sunday edition to compete
with the Times. The Times responded with an afternoon paper called
The Chattanooga Post.
   The newspapers sued each other, and the Post was discontinued in
1970 after Times officials signed a consent decree in an antitrust
suit filed by the Justice Department.
   The Times also paid a settlement to the News-Free Press that was
reported to be $2 million to $3 million. McDonald used that money
to buy a new press.
   In 1980, the papers entered a new operating agreement in which
the Times, which had lost $2 million over five years, agreed to
give up its Sunday edition.
   Survivors include his wife, Elizabeth; a son, Frank S. McDonald;
daughters Helen McDonald Exum, Dr. Martha W. McDonald, Betsy
McDonald Anderson and Nancy McDonald Reinke; and numerous
grandchildren.

   Oil was taken today from the damaged
tanks of a barge that ran aground in Buzzards Bay near where the
cruise ship Bermuda Star scraped bottom last week, officials said.
   Transfer of some 1.2 million gallons began late Monday night and
continued today at the rate of 50,000 gallons an hour, U.S. Coast
Guard Lt. James Donovan said. The process should be completed
today, allowing the barge owner to move the vessel.
   Four of the barge's 16 tanks were damaged in the accident, but
the spill was estimated to be no more than 10 gallons of the No. 2
fuel, used for home heating and diesel engines, said Donovan.
   ``The slick that went out was almost too small to see,'' Coast
Guard Lt. Peter Keane said earlier.
   The barge, bound from New Jersey to Maine, has a capacity of
5.23 million gallons, was being towed by a tugboat when it hit
Monday, the U.S. Coast Guard said.
   The barge stopped leaking shortly after it hit the rocks, and
Coast Guard crews refloated the barge Monday evening.
   Coast Guard Chief Diego Mello said the barge ran aground on
rocks about a mile from where Bermuda Star, with more than 1,000
passengers and crew aboard, ran aground near the entrance to the
Cape Cod Canal.
   The Bermuda Star accident ripped a 90-foot gash in its hull,
spilling thousands of gallons of diesel fuel. Those on board were
ferried to safety.
   Buzzards Bay fronts the western shore of Cape Cod, about 50
miles southeast of Boston.

<HEAD>Iran Expresses Discontent Over Movie Portrayal of Khomeini</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ZEYNEP ALEMDAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran has asked Turkey to halt screenings
of an American movie that mocks the late Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, a government official said today.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told The
Associated Press that Iran made the request through diplomatic
channels on Saturday, a day after five movie theaters in Istanbul
and one in Ankara began showing ``The Naked Gun.''
   The official said the government was considering the matter and
would see whether it was possible to edit out the brief segment
lampooning Khomeini.
   The Iranian News Agency IRNA reported that the Turkish charge
d'affaires in Tehran was summoned to the Foreign Ministry today and
informed of Iran's unhappiness with the film.
   Turkish Foreign Minister Ali Bozer is scheduled to pay an
official visit to Iran on June 25. The Turkish official said his
country did not want the film to harm relations with Iran.
   Turkey is a predominantly Moslem country but has secular laws.
   Different interpretations of Islam's role in public life has
caused strains between Turkey and neighboring Iran in the past.
   ``The Naked Gun,'' directed by David Zucker, is a spoof and
stars Leslie Nielsen as an incompetent detective, Lt. Frank Drebin.
   In one scene, Drebin punches a character that looks like
Khomeini and reveals a spiked punk hairdo under his turban.
   Others portrayed in the 1988 film include Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, PLO Chairman
Yasser Arafat and former Ugandan president Idi Amin.
   Spokesmen for the five theaters showing ``The Naked Gun'' in
Istanbul said they had received anonymous phone calls threatening
attacks against the cinemas.
   Operators of three theaters said they edited out the parts about
Khomeini after receiving bomb threats. The two others were still
running the film intact.
   Salih Karakus, director of the Atlantik theater, said he planned
to show the movie at least another three weeks. ``It is doing such
a good business,'' he said.
   A spokesman for Metropol Theater in Ankara said no threats had
been made and that the movie would continue to be be shown in its
original form. ``We are against any kind of censorship,'' he said.

   Investigators are trying to trace the
weapons used by a man to kill at least 10 people in two days before
taking his own life.
   Authorities reviewed registration forms and other leads on how
James Edward Pough, 42, obtained the weapons for the rampage that
began Sunday in a Jacksonville neighborhood and ended Monday inside
an auto loan company.
   ``We're trying to find the answer to that right now,'' Sheriff
James McMillan said.
   Pough had been convicted of a felony in the 1970s, and it is
illegal in Florida for convicted felons to own handguns. But a
police spokesman today said Pough would apparently not have been
considered a convicted felon.
   In 1971, Pough was charged with manslaughter in a shooting
death. He pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and was sentenced to
five years' probation, court records show.
   The records show that if Pough obeyed the terms of his
probation, the case was to be removed from his record. An overnight
records check showed that Pough successfully completed his
probation, said Asa Higgs, a police spokesman. Officials were still
checking to confirm that the case was removed.
   Under Florida law, background checks before a weapons purchase
depend heavily on what the buyer discloses.
   Until strengthened gun laws take effect Oct. 1, gun purchasers
are required only to have some identification, such as a driver's
license, and fill out a questionnaire on arrests, mental illness
and drug use.
   Merchants are not required to check the information, and there
is no way for them to confirm it other than by calling police
agencies themselves.
   The new statute requires that all applications be checked by a
central computer in Tallahassee.
   Pough entered a General Motors Acceptance Corp. office Monday
and shot customers and employees, some cowering under their desks.
Pough killed eight people and seriously injured five before taking
his own life.
   GMAC had repossessed Pough's car in January. The sheriff said
that may not have been Pough's sole motive, but he offered no
further suggestions.
   Police said witnesses also identified Pough as the person who
killed a man and a woman in separate shootings Sunday near Pough's
home.
   Police said those killings were done with the same .30-caliber
semiautomatic rifle used on Monday.
   Pough shot himself with a .38-caliber revolver that he had
registered in 1979, McMillan said. Federal agents were checking
whether the rifle was registered.
   A 9mm semiautomatic pistol registered to Pough was found in his
car outside the building, McMillan said. He also had a registered
.357-caliber, but no information was given on that weapon's
location.

<HEAD>Report Questions GOP Candidate's Experience Claims</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 9 grafs to UPDATE with Rinfret's son promising
detailed resume; `no-comment' from state GOP. Picks up 5th graf
pvs: `Nixon did ...</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Republican challenging Gov. Mario Cuomo's
re-election bid may have exaggerated some claims about his
political and education experience, a newspaper reported today.
   Some former Nixon administration officials disputed Pierre
Rinfret's suggestion that he was a major adviser to the president,
The New York Times said.
   The Times also said Rinfret never earned a doctorate, but has
used the title ``Dr. Rinfret'' on resumes, on legal documents and
in his political biography.
   The state GOP nominated Rinfret, 66, last month. The millionaire
economist, a political unknown, was chosen after the party made a
months-long effort to persuade better-known Republicans to run
against the popular two-term Democrat.
   In his acceptance speech at the State Republican convention,
Rinfret said he was ``offered the equivalent of three Cabinet
posts'' by Nixon.
   In an interview, he told the Times that Nixon personally offered
to make him a member of his Council of Economic Advisers in 1968
and secretary of commerce in 1972. Rinfret also said two Nixon
aides asked him if he would be interested in becoming secretary of
the treasury in 1971.
   Calls to Rinfret at his home and office this morning were not
immediately returned. But his son and adviser, Peter Rinfret,
promised to release an information packet ``with primary sources''
that would provide much detail, including his father's World War II
heroics.
   ``I'm not going to respond to that,'' said Peter Rinfret when
asked if his father might have exaggerated his credentials.
   Elizabeth DelTorto, a top aide to state GOP Chairman J. Patrick
Barrett, said the party would have no comment, adding: ``If Mr.
Rinfret wants to say anything, that's up to him.''
   Nixon did not respond to several telephone messages left at his
office, the newspaper said. But top aides in his administration,
including chief domestic policy adviser John Erlichman, Treasury
Secretary John Connally and two chairmen of the Council of Economic
Advisers, Paul McCracken and Herbert Stein, said they did not know
that Rinfret had been considered seriously for any of the posts.
   Several Nixon aides said Rinfret did occasionally have the ear
of the president, but the Times quoted one top Nixon adviser as
saying that Nixon consulted Rinfret ``to placate him,'' because he
was prone to criticizing administration policy.
   New York Times columnist and former Nixon aide William Safire,
however, said he recalled that Rinfret was offered a job on the
Council of Economic Advisers after Nixon's election in 1968. Safire
also said Nixon valued Rinfret's advice.
   Rinfret earned a diploma at the University of Dijon in France in
1946 that university officials said was the equivalent of an
American master's degree.
   After returning to the United States, Rinfret was told by a
French diplomatic official that he could call the degree a
doctorate, the Times said.
   But university officials told the Times he would have had to
study at least four more years and finish a dissertation to earn
the French equivalent of a doctorate.
   Rinfret said that even if the Dijon doctorate does not count, he
can claim a doctorate because of an honorary degree he received
from Pepperdine University in Malibu, Calif., in 1973.
   Rinfret is president of Rinfret Inc., a group of consulting and
financial-futures trading firms.

   Friends of Kerri Polivka say they are not
surprised she put a 9-year-old girl into a bathtub that was whisked
safely away from a trailer home as it was torn apart in a flash
flood.
   The body of 13-year-old Kerri was found Monday in the Ohio
River, bringing to 21 the number known to have died in the
flooding. Thirteen people were listed as missing.
   Kerri, of Wegee, was baby-sitting at the home of Amber Colvin
when a storm Thursday dumped 5{ inches of rain in about three
hours, sending a wall of water rushing down two small creeks that
empty into the river.
   Kerri put Amber in the tub and got in with her. The two became
separated after Kerri was hit on the head as the trailer collapsed,
Amber said Friday.
   Amber said she survived by holding onto logs and was rescued 7{
hours later when she reached the bank of the Ohio River. She
suffered cuts and scratches.
   ``She would have thought of Amber first because she was watching
her that night,'' said Angel Halpin, a sixth-grade classmate and
one of Kerri's closest friends.
   Angel said she believed searchers sifting through debris along
the Wegee and Pipe creeks would find Kerri alive. ``I kept saying
to myself that she had a broken leg or something and was just
sitting somewhere waiting for help,'' she said.
   Rescuers held out little hope that any of the missing would turn
up alive.
   Fifty-five people stood in line this morning outside a disaster
relief application center in Shadyside before it opened. It is one
of three application centers the Federal Emergency Management
Agency planned to open this week. The others are in Adena in
Jefferson County and Dillonvale in Harrison County.
   The FEMA said its preliminary assessment showed that at least
700 homes were destroyed or damaged by the flooding in Belmont,
Jefferson and Harrison counties.
   A National Weather Service official said the storm developed so
quickly there was no time to issue a flash flood warning.
   ``We're dealing with God almighty here, nature itself. Sometimes
nature just isn't predictable,'' said Ed Heath, director of the
weather service office in Akron.
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which
oversees the weather service, said it would investigate its
performance. Such investigations are routine in disasters involving
more than five deaths, the agency said.
   The first funerals were held Monday for victims of the flood.
   About 100 people gathered at morning services for Roger DeNoon.
Funerals were held later in the day for John and Edna Andrecht in
Shadyside and 6-year-old Timmy Gatten in Jacobsburg. Several
services were scheduled today.
   ``I'm not sure any of us can prepare for this type of a
tragedy,'' said Capt. Tim Muir, a Salvation Army chaplain who
delivered the eulogy at DeNoon's funeral. ``The thing we have to
look at is found in Isaiah 38:1 _ `Thus saith the Lord: ``Set thy
house in order, for thou shalt die and not live.'''
   News that Kerri's body had been found will be especially
difficult to accept at Leona Avenue Middle School, where she was an
A and B student who made friends easily, said Principal John Krupa.
   ``She was just the type of girl everyone would like to have as a
daughter. Maybe mine will follow in her footsteps,'' Krupa said.
   He pulled her student file and looked at it. ``There's nothing
anywhere in here that shows she was ever in any kind of trouble and
nothing that shows that she was the smartest girl in the world,''
Krupa said. ``Kerri just did her job.''

   A stowaway cat that shared a shipping
container with a Mercedes Benz for 48 days without food and water
has found a new home _ with the car's owner.
   The black feline, which appropriately has been named Mercedes,
will have to wait 226 days to move into her new home with Marla
Skartvedt because of Australia's strict quarantine regulations.
   Qurantine officials had received dozens of calls about the
animal since her arrival a week ago on board a ship from London. A
spokeswoman for the South Australian Department of Agriculture said
the quarantine costs of $1,623 would be paid by Mrs. Skartvedt, the
South Australia Animal Welfare League, a cat-food manufacturer and
the company that owns the shipping container.
   She said a special ``Mercedes Fund'' would be set up to take
public donations, with anything left over going to cat charities.
   Mercedes was reported Tuesday to be healthy and happy at the
suburban Torrens Island quarantine center.

   Forget rap. Luciano Pavarotti is the new kid on
the block of the British pop charts.
   His rendition of ``Nessun Dorma'' from Puccini's opera
``Turandot'' has jumped to No. 3 on the singles chart, due in large
part to the daily play it receives as the theme for the BBC's World
Cup soccer coverage.
   The single's popularity propelled Pavarotti's album,``The
Essential Pavarotti,'' to the top of the pop album list. Jessica
Atkinson, a spokeswoman for Decca Records, this is the first time a
classical album has hit No. 1 on the pop album chart.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. chose ``Nessun Dorma'' as its
World Cup theme after Pavarotti sang it during the opening ceremony
for the team draw in December, said BBC spokesman Mike Gardner.
   ``Nessun Dorma'' (``none shall sleep'') is a romantic song
expressing the optimism of Calaf that he will marry the
hard-hearted princess, Turandot.

   Activists protesting U.S. immigration
restrictions on people with the AIDS virus surged into the U.S.
Consulate on Tuesday after destroying an American flag and
scrawling graffiti on the building.
   Scuffles broke out between police and the protesters who flooded
the foyer, and seven people were arrested.
   The AIDS Coalition To Unleash Power, or ACT UP, timed the
protest to coincide with worldwide actions marking the Sixth
International AIDS conference, which opens in San Francisco on
Wednesday.
   International AIDS groups, major health organizations and
several governments have boycotted the conference to protest a U.S.
law under which people testing positive for the AIDS virus can be
barred from entering the country.
   ACT UP spokesman Bruce Brown told the protesters, who numbered
more than 100,,that President Bush is ``history's greatest serial
killer'' because of his ``wimpish'' stand against acquired immune
defiency syndrome.
   He said many infected people are homeless and begging on the
streets because of government inaction.
   The travel restrictions are fueling discrimination against
homosexuals and people with AIDS, and they are a political rather
than health measure, Brown said.
   A police spokesman said the arrested demonstrators were charged
with a series of offenses, including malicious damage, assaulting
police, hindering police, offensive language and resisting arrest.
All were given unconditional bail and ordered to appear in court
July 10.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring. The scientific name for
the virus is human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV.

<TEXT>
   Housing starts fell in May for the fourth
consecutive month to their lowest level since the last recession,
the government said Tuesday.
   Analysts, who said the decline was further evidence that the
housing market continues to weaken, attributed the 1.4 percent fall
to high mortgage rates, tight credit, a large inventory of new and
existing homes, wet weather and a sluggish economy resulting in
slackening consumer confidence.
   The Commerce Department said starts of new homes and apartments
totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.21 million units,
the smallest number since 1.17 million units got under way in
October 1982 at the end of the last recession.
   David Seiders, the National Association of Home Builders' chief
economist, said a survey of its members in early June pointed to
continuing weakness.
   Applications for building permits _ often a barometer of future
housing activity _ also have fallen for four straight months, noted
Martin Regalia, chief economist with the National Council of
Savings Institutions.
   Such applications declined 4.6 percent to 1.06 million after
falling 10.1 percent in April. The May level was the lowest since
1.04 million were recorded in September 1982.
   ``It's not a rosy picture at all for the remainder of the
year,'' Regalia said.
   Mortgage rates, which dropped into the single digits toward the
end of last year, rose above the 10 percent level in January and
ranged from 10.33 percent to 10.67 percent in May, according to
surveys by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. Rates fell to 10.12
percent by last Friday.
   David Berson, chief economist with the Federal National Mortgage
Association, said declining rates may help the single-family
sector. But he said builder uncertainty over proposed federal
regulations governing handicapped access to apartment buildings
will continue to slow the multifamily sector.
   John A. Tuccillo, chief economist for the National Association
of Realtors, said many builders have had trouble getting
construction loans because of the constraints of the savings and
loan bailout law and tighter lending restrictions by banks.
   Economist Richard Peach of the Mortgage Bankers Association
noted that May was a very wet month over parts of the nation, but
also cited interest rates and large inventories of new and existing
homes.
   ``It's not an environment in which builders wanted to go out on
a limb and start a whole slew of new units,'' he said.
   Part of the inventory problems, Regalia said, is the effect of
the slowing economy on consumer confidence.
   ``Consumers, rather than spending to the limit, are starting to
increase savings dramatically,'' he said. ``One of the first things
that goes when you have this kind of ... retrenchment is big-ticket
items _ cars and houses, things that people can discretionarily
push off into the future.''
   Construction of single-family homes in May fell 1 percent to an
annual rate of 896,000 units on top of a 9.1 percent drop in April.
It was the lowest number of single-family starts since 862,000 got
under way in December 1982.
   Apartment construction slipped 2.5 percent to an annual rate of
311,000 units after rising 2.6 percent the previous month.
   The building activity means the pace during the first five
months of 1990 was 5.3 percent below that of the same period of
1989.
   Starts slumped 8 percent to 266,000 units in the Midwest and
fell 3.3 percent to 337,000 units in the West.
   Increases were posted in the South, up 3.2 percent to 486,000
units, and the Northeast, up 1.6 percent to 129,000 units.

   The International Committee of the Red Cross will
resume operations in war-torn Ethiopia after an absence of two
years, a spokeswoman said Tuesday.
   Emergency medical teams from the Swiss humanitarian agency are
expected to arrive in Ethiopia by the end of this week to treat
victims of the fighting between government forces and rebels, she
said.
   The spokeswoman, who asked not to be identified, said the
agreement followed long negotiations with the Ethiopian government.
She added that the ICRC will decide later whether to expand its
assistance to non-medical operations such as famine relief.
   The Geneva-based agency withdrew from Ethiopia in June 1988
after the Marxist-led government ordered all foreign relief
agencies to leave the northern provinces of Eritrea and Tigre, home
of the two insurgency movements fighting the government.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today endorsed the
formation of a separate Communist Party in the Soviet Union's
biggest republic, but warned of friction between national leaders
and those in the Russian republic.
   ``I view ... the Russian Communist Party as part of the Soviet
Communist Party. And I sharply disagree with those who seek the
salvation of Russia in withdrawing from the Soviet Union,'' he said
at the opening of a party conference expected to formally
re-establish the separate party.
   The champion of that movement for greater Russian independence
is the newly elected president of the Russian Federation, Boris N.
Yeltsin, who sat near Gorbachev on the dais.
   Radicals, including Yeltsin, view formation of the party a means
of weakening central authority and hastening economic and political
reforms. Conservatives, especially nationalists, see a Russian
party as a vehicle of preserving political and cultural traditions.
   Gorbachev was expected to receive criticism from both groups.
   The speaker after Gorbachev, Ivan Osadchi, said the party
leadership ``has reduced (the party) to crouching instead in the
trenches under massive shelling by anti-socialist forces, which
have rapidly organized themselves.''
   The Russian party session is viewed as a bellwether of the 28th
Congress of the national Communist Party, due to start July 2.
   Russia, with more than half of the Soviet population and
three-quarters of its territory, is home to 58 percent of the
country's more than 18 million Communist Party members.
   The delegates to the Russian conference will also represent the
republic at the national congress.
   The delegates voted 2,607 to 61, with 16 abstentions, to adopt
the agenda proposed by Gorbachev to consider the formation of the
Russian party and to debate the proposed platform of the national
congress, and not to discuss their own platform.
   The separate Russian Communist Party was absorbed into the
national party 65 years ago.
   Of the 15 Soviet republics, only Russia has not had its own
party, in large part because Russians have controlled the national
and regional parties.
   Gorbachev is seeking to steer the conference on a centrist
course between radicals who want to hasten steps toward a market
economy and conservatives who want to slow the reforms.
   He defended his cautious economic and political reforms and
resisted efforts by radicals to open a debate on Russian
sovereignty.
   ``Already we hear the opinion that perestroika has worsened the
situation in the country.'' he said, citing accusations that the
reforms had lowered living standards and raised tensions among
ethnic groups.
   He claimed his reforms had accomplished more at home and abroad
in three years than similar efforts over the previous 30 years. He
cited the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan as a
signficant step toward reducing global tension.
   But he said domestic restructuring ``is hampered by ... an
ossified and conservative public consciousness that was formed
during decades of totalitarian ideology.''
   This conference comes a week after the Russian republic's
parliament approved a resolution calling for further legislation to
declare that Russian laws supersede Soviet laws on Russian
territory.
   The resolution, which did not carry the force of law, opened the
door for the Russian parliament to pass legislation transferring
most political and economic decision-making power from central to
republic authorities.
   Although Gorbachev acted as chairman of the session he was not
among the candidates considered likely to be elected as first
secretary, or leader, of the new party.
   Those in the running were the Soviet premier, Nikolai Ryzhkov;
Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin; Yuri Mananenkov, a secretary of
the national party; said Andrei Girenko, another national party
secretary.
   Delegates to the Russian party conference voted 2,607 to 61,
with 16 abstentions, to adopt the agenda proposed by Gorbachev.
Under it, they will consider the formation of the Russian party and
debate the proposed platform of the national congress.

   Big-city mayors are angrily attacking Congress
after being told by a leading Democrat that they stand little
chance of getting any new federal help _ even if there's a peace
dividend from defense cuts.
   ``If you have a $500 suit and unlimited campaign contributions,
like the greedy and corrupt savings and loans, you can get whatever
you want from Washington,'' Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn said Monday.
``But if you try to get a few dollars for the poor and needy you
are totally ignored.''
   Flynn and other mayors attending the summer meeting of the U.S.
Conference of Mayors went on the offensive after House Ways and
Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski told them cities stood
little or no chance of getting any more federal help in the near
future.
   Today, New York Mayor David Dinkins made his first appearance at
the conference and, despite Rostenkowski's message, led the mayors
in a populist appeal for a city share of the peace dividend.
   ``Peace has brought with it a spendable dividend,'' Dinkins
said. ``And if that money was available to build bombers, it
certainly is available to rebuild our cities. ... It is a challenge
that we _ the mayors of America _ must mobilize to meet.''
   Rostenkowski's assessment came as a blow to the mayors, who
spent the weekend crafting a new urban agenda that depends heavily
on cities getting billions from the government after a decade of
cuts in aid.
   ``There's no money for such programs until the budget blockade
is broken,'' Rostenkowski said in a blunt speech to the more than
200 mayors.
   ``We need movers and shakers in Congress who will stand for the
cities like they stood for the corrupt S&amp;Ls,'' Mayor Sharpe James
of Newark, N.J., said in an interview. ``Being in Congress now is
like getting tenure _ you're not accountable to the people any
more.''
   Not all of the attacks came from big-city, Northeast mayors.
   ``We're trying to control the intense level of frustration that
we have right now,'' said Mayor Lee Robinson of Macon, Ga.
``Congress keeps telling us to man the front line on the war on
drugs and other issues, but while we're out there getting beat up
they're not offering any help and are hiding.''
   Not long after Rostenkowski spoke, the mayors heard a somewhat
more encouraging speech from Democratic Sen. Robert Kerrey of
Nebraska.
   But while supportive of the mayors' causes, Kerrey too said no
funding for them would come from any peace dividend. Instead, he
said mayors would have to take their case to the people much like
Ronald Reagan did in the early 1980s when his proposed military
buildup faced congressional opposition.
   ``If they believe it is worthwhile, they will do it,'' Kerrey
said of the American public.
   Kerrey said Congress has been hiding behind the federal deficit
and brushes off the requests of cities and other constituencies by
pointing to the defict targets contained in the Gramm-Rudman law.
   But Kerrey said Congress could solve the deficit problem if it
had the political courage to defend higher taxes and other
necessary steps.

   After six weeks of searching for 13{ tons
of stolen coffee, this was the break authorities were looking for.
   A police officer became suspicious of a trailer that had been
parked along a freeway for nearly two weeks in this San Bernardino
County city and ran the license plate through a computer.
   The computer found nothing wrong, but the notion that something
wasn't quite right kept percolating in Officer Tim Lane's police
mind.
   Finally, on Saturday, he ran the trailer's vehicle
identification number, and the case of the missing Folgers was
cracked.
   The computer showed the refrigerated trailer was stolen last
April in North Hollywood. Inside, officers found about 9,000
three-pound packages of Folgers, which was unloaded Monday.
   Capt. George Westcott said police traced the lot numbers of the
coffee and determined it had been stolen May 2 in San Francisco.
   It was not immediately known why the coffee was abandoned.

<TEXT>
   Scientists from Mexico and the United States
are launching an intense study of the monsoon-like weather that
brings summer rainfall to the Southwest, the government announced
Tuesday.
   The month-long analysis begins July 8, seeking to learn more
about the wet and dry seasons in portions of the United States and
Mexico.
   The Southwestern climate can contribute to severe weather as far
away as the Great Lakes, said Robert Maddox, director of the
National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, Okla.
   Scientists said it may take about a year to analyze the
information they collect, and they hope to use it to more
accurately predict severe storms.
   Although monsoons are usually associated with the climate of
southeast Asia, they can also occur in climates with sea-to-land
breezes in summer and land-to-sea winds in winter.
   That type of circulation occurs over the southwestern United
States and northeastern Mexico. Summer heat in the region causes
the air to rise, drawing moist air from the Pacific Ocean and Gulf
of California and contributing to thunderstorms.
   Mexican and American scientists will launch balloons to check
upper-air conditions at several sites in the region, and studies
will be conducted from aircraft based in Phoenix, Ariz.
   In addition, scientists will also seek to determine if added
heat generated by the city of Phoenix affects weather nearby,
particularly the summer storms in nearby mountains.
   Taking part in the study are scientists from the NOAA's National
Weather Service and National Environmental Satellite, Data and
Information Service; Arizona State University, the University of
Arizona, the Salt River Project, the Mexican Weather Service, the
NOAA-University of Colorado Cooperative Institute for Research in
the Environmental Sciences and the Mexican Centro de Investigacion
Cientifica y de Education Superior de Ensenada.

<TEXT>
   Ten Albanians arrived in Greece this week
after fleeing their homeland, leading to speculation the hard-line
country has relaxed border controls, a Foreign Ministry official
said Tuesday.
   The refugees included two brothers whose alleged torture in
their homeland last year sparked diplomatic tension between Greece
and Albania, the official said.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with
standard procedures, said the 10 Albanians crossed into northern
Greece on Sunday and Monday. Eight of the 10 are ethnic Greeks, he
said.
   ``The fact that more than 50 Albanians have crossed the border
since January has led to speculation that Albanian authorities are
slackening border controls,'' the official said.
   Albania, the last bastion of Stalinism in Europe, has indicated
it wants to end its international isolation by resuming ties with
the two superpowers and joining the 35-nation Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe.
   Brothers George and Dimitris Prassos, who were among those
arriving in Greece this week, said in an interview published
Tuesday that Albania's secret police repeatedly beat them after an
abortive attempt to escape last October.
   They were tied to a tractor and dragged around border villages
to set an example for possible defectors, the two told the Athens
daily newspaper Eleftheros Typos. They claimed they were jailed
until Dec. 22 and lived on a diet of macaroni and rotting onions in
custody.
   The Orthodox Church of Greece reported in December that the
brothers had been killed after trying to flee Albania.

<TEXT>
   An oil slick lingering in the Gulf of
Mexico remained stalled some 7 to 10 miles offshore today as
cleanup crews readied for the arrival of tar balls for the second
day.
   Coast Guard officials said an early morning flyover showed no
signs that tar balls from the supertanker Mega Borg spill had
washed ashore overnight. Earlier, officials in Louisiana had said
that tar balls were found on some beaches but that it was possible
they were not from the Mega Borg.
   The slick changed direction slightly, with predictions that it
would reach land closer to High Island northeast of Galveston than
Sea Rim State Park farther east, the Coast Guard said.
   ``That's good news,'' said Petty Officer Mark Sedwick. ``That
means it will be away from the marsh areas where we were concerned
about the wildlife.''
   Officials had predicted the 30-mile oil slick would hit the
shore along a 45-mile stretch northeast of Galveston, between High
Island and Sabine Pass near the Texas-Louisiana border. There are
three national wildlife refuges in the area.
   Meanwhile, about 1,200 volunteers in five counties remained on
alert to help clean the beaches if the messy tar balls hit. The
General Land Office expected at least 100 volunteers to arrive at
Sea Rim State Park today for the second day to prepare for the tar
balls.
   On Monday, about 60 volunteers mobilized for the supertanker tar
cleanup instead picked up hundreds of pounds of debris, seaweed and
old oil on a six-mile stretch of the state park beach. Clearing the
beach of debris will make it easier to clean up the oil later.
   ``They said they needed volunteers and I said, `Does that mean
me?' And I said, `Why not me?''' said Jo Krose, who drove two hours
from Kirbyville.
   Offshore cleanup operations from the supertanker Mega Borg
continued today as well, with the oil sheen so faint that it could
only be seen by helicopter crews.
   ``We're getting close to the point where you have to really look
for the oil,'' said Coast Guard Chief Warrant Officer Rick Meidt.
``The cleanup crews have to have a helicopter up there because they
can't see it in the water.''
   The cleanup effort today included the state-of-the-art Mexican
skimmer, ECOPEMEX, and 10 other skimmers, some working within four
miles of the shoreline. Booms and other deflector devices also have
been deployed along a 45-mile area. The Coast Guard had five beach
patrols in areas stretching up to Sabine Pass today.
   Coast Guard officials said 3.9 million gallons of oil has leaked
from the Mega Borg since it was rocked by explosions June 8 some 57
miles off Galveston. Most of that oil has either burned off,
evaporated or been collected. The Coast Guard said it had no good
estimate of how much oil remains in the Gulf.
   The vessel's owner arranged for a tanker to begin transferring
the Angolan crude off the damaged ship today, said company attorney
Robert Klawetter. But Sedwick said crews are continuing tests of
the vessel today before any cargo is transferred.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China has bought an additional 359,775 metric
tons of U.S. wheat under a price subsidy program, the Agriculture
Department said Tuesday.
   F. Paul Dickerson, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said six private exporting companies
made the deals under the department's Export Enhancement Program,
or EEP.
   Delivery of the wheat is scheduled for October, he said.
   The sales were part of 2 million tons authorized for China under
EEP on May 2. Previous allocations had been exhausted except for
5,050 tons. Dickerson said China has 1,145,425 tons remaining in
its current allocation.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The latest sales would be about 13.2 million bushels. At
current prices estimated by USDA at around $3.33 per bushel, the
wheat would have a farm value of around $44 million.
   Under EEP arrangements, private exporters can sell U.S.
commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in
selected overseas markets and then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   Dickerson said the latest subsidies averaged $16.62 per ton, or
about 45 cents per bushel.
   The subsidized sales were handled by Alfred C. Toepfer
International Inc., 100,000 tons; Cargill Inc., 80,000; Bunge
Corp., 50,000; Ferruzzi U.S.A. Inc., 45,000; Tradigrain Inc.,
44,775; and Central States Enterprises Inc., 40,000.
   With the latest sales, China has bought about 2 million tons of
U.S. wheat for delivery in the 1990-91 wheat marketing year that
will begin June 1, compared with 5.6 million tons in 1989-90.

   Marion Barry ``was snorting dope up his nose''
while warning his constituents about the dangers of drugs, a
federal prosecutor said today in opening arguments at the mayor's
trial.
   Barry's lawyer, R. Kenneth Mundy, quickly countered by telling
the jury the mayor was the victim of entrapment and that
prosecution witnesses include ``notorious drug dealers'' who are
not believable.
   Barry was accompanied by his wife, Effi, in court. He said on
his way in that he felt ``fine.'' But he wiped his forehead when
assistant U.S. attorney Richard Roberts said the jury would be
shown an FBI videotape showing Barry ``smoking crack'' on the night
of his arrest.
   The case against the mayor is ``about deceit and deception
designed to keep the police, the public and the government from
discovering'' the truth, said Roberts.
   ``The defendant ... had been smoking crack ... all over town for
years,'' said the prosecutor, sometimes even accepting a supply of
drugs in his office.
   Mundy disparaged the prosecution's witnesses as a ``cast of
characters'' who have struck deals with the government so that they
won't be prosecuted or who have been allowed to plead guilty to
reduced charges.
   Barry, 54, has pleaded innocent to criminal charges alleging
that he possessed cocaine repeatedly over a five-year span and that
he lied to a federal grand jury in 1989 about his alleged
involvement with drugs.
   He could face up to 26 years in prison and $1.85 million in
fines if convicted on all counts.
   The opening arguments were a prelude to what is expected to be a
month-long trial featuring the FBI videotape made in a hotel room
the night of Jan. 18.
   The jurors will see ``black and white video'' of Barry ``smoking
crack ... lighting with a cigarette light ... just like this,''
said the prosecutor, demonstrating for the jury. Roberts twice
extended his arms, inhaled deeply, held his breath for several
seconds and exhaled.
   ``The evidence will show entrapment'' of Barry by the FBI at the
Vista Hotel, said Mundy. The government ``went all the way to
California to bring'' ex-model Rasheeda Moore to Washington as part
of the sting operation, Mundy said.
   But Roberts told a different story. ``You will learn that while
preaching about'' not using ``dope, he was snorting dope up his
nose,'' Roberts said of Barry, the District of Columbia's mayor
since 1979.
   The prosecution will bring a series of friends and acquaintances
to the witness stand to testify about Barry's drug use, said
Roberts.
   But Mundy quickly attacked the credibility of defense witnesses.
He said Charles Lewis, a key government witness against Barry, has
pleaded guilty to drug charges and agreed to play ``any tune the
government wanted him to.''
   Barry's lawyer characterized Lewis as one of the ``notorious
drug dealers'' who will testify in the case.
   Roberts said that Barry's friends and acquaintances ``kept him
supplied with drugs'' over a five-year span and that ``they
conspired with him to keep ... his secret.''
   In his first visit to Lewis's hotel room in December 1988, Barry
took out a matchbox containing ``rocks of crack cocaine,'' said
Roberts.
   ``You took care of me in the Virgin Islands, I will take care of
you up here,'' Roberts quoted Barry as telling Lewis.
   On another visit, Lewis and Barry ``smoked their way all the way
through ``Monday Night Football'' and well into'' Ted Koppel's
``Nightline,'' said Roberts.
   A jury of five whites and 13 blacks was chosen Monday to hear
the evidence in Barry's trial, which is moving into the full trial
stage after plea bargaining discussions failed to produce any
agreement.
   U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ordered the 18
sequestered for the duration of the trial.

   A town's ordinance strictly regulating
signs discriminates against political speech and therefore is
unconstitutional, a Superior Court judge ruled this morning.
   Judge Melanie Famiglietti threw out the case against a
Barrington man who had been convicted of erecting signs in his yard
in 1984 and 1985 without a permit, as required by town ordinances.
   The judge said the signs that James Lemoi, 70, installed in his
yard were appeals for help after the death of his wife and a fire
at his house, and a political statement about town officials, both
of which were prohibited without a permit from the town.
   Barrington allows a variety of signs to be installed without a
permit to advertise a house for sale or a professional business
such as a law firm in a home, or signs in connection with a holiday
decoration. Other signs are permitted only if a permit is obtained
before they are erected.
   Famiglietti said that the town cannot regulate signs by their
content, which was what it did in the case of Lemoi. ``If these
very same signs indicated a doctor's office in (Lemoi's) home or
were a theater marquee or were holiday decorations, Mr. Lemoi would
not be in court today and would not be fined $13,000,'' the judge
said.
   In December 1984, Lemoi's wife died and just a few days later
his house caught fire, causing extensive damage. He was not home at
the time and was not hurt.
   About 10 days after the fire, Lemoi put a sign up in his yard
seeking public help. Seven months later, after he was unable to
obtain police or fire department reports about the fire, he erected
another sign, stating simply: ``Come Clean.''
   It was after that sign that Barrington charged Lemoi in District
Court with violating the town sign ordinance. He was found guilty
and fined $13,000. He challenged his conviction and the American
Civil Liberties Union's Rhode Island affiliate took up the case
when it reached Superior Court.
   An attorney for the town, Michael Mosco, said he did not know
whether he would appeal the ruling to the state Supreme Court. He
said that decision would be made by the town council.
   Mosco defended the ordinance, saying that requiring a permit for
certain types of signs was logical. ``We consider any sign in the
town of Barrington as permissible,'' he said. ``We think it's a
reasonable sign ordinance.''
   But ACLU attorney Elizabeth Colt said Judge Famiglietti's
decision clearly stated that the ordinance is unconstitutional.
``You can't distinguish among signs,'' Ms. Colt said, adding that
sign regulations have to be ``content-neutral.''

<HEAD>Cheney Presents Study of 25 Percent Force Cut</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Top 6 grafs new with figures, comments from Aspin; picks up

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told budget
negotiators today that a 25 percent cut in the nation's military
force over the next five years would reduce Pentagon spending by
only about 10 percent.
   Cheney's figures dissatisfied many congressional Democrats who
attended the talks. House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les
Aspin argued that the defense chief could have made different
decisions in the structure of the military that could have yielded
savings of 18 percent to 27 percent.
   ``They have made a set of policy choices to get there that I
think are awfully cautious,'' Aspin, D-Wis., told reporters.
   According to Cheney's numbers, a 25 percent reduction in Army
divisions, Navy fleets and Air Force wings would reduce the fiscal
1991 defense budget President Bush submitted in January from $303.3
billion to $302 billion. Over five years, it would cut $8.6 billion
from Bush's proposal.
   The 25 percent cut in military strength did not yield a
corresponding dollar savings because it would be phased in
gradually, and because some of the more expensive elements of the
Pentagon budget _ such as weapons development and acquisition _
would not be cut deeply.
   Cheney said his numbers were meant as an illustration, not an
offer to budget negotiators.
   In the budget talks, Bush administration officials and Congress
are searching for somewhere between $45 billion and $60 billion in
new taxes or spending cuts before fiscal 1991, which starts Oct. 1.
   A major source of funds could be the military budget, but Cheney
says he's concerned that spending could be cut too sharply or too
quickly, harming the nation's defense.
   He agreed to present budget negotiators with his study, which
would look at the effect of reducing the military force structure
by 25 percent over a five-year period.
   ``The good news was that Cheney would entertain such a cut,''
Aspin said in his memo. ``The bad news was that he believes it can
be done while cutting the defense budget by only 10 percent over
the same period.''
   Aspin contended that when high-cost items are pared from the
Pentagon's spending list, he could find a cost savings of between
18 and 27 percent.
   Aspin sent the memo to Majority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., and
House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., two of the
most important Democrats in the budget negotiations.
   But Cheney's aides have insisted that his report to the budget
negotiators is not to be taken as a plan for reducing the forces,
or the Pentagon budget, even though those cuts might be in store
for the nation's military.
   Besides the 25 percent pare-down, Cheney also planned to lay out
the effects of far deeper cuts in defense spending called for in
the House and Senate.
   Pentagon officials have said the study would keep spending
levels along the lines that Cheney has projected for the coming
years, which is a proposal for a 2 percent cut in real growth after
inflation is taken into account.
   Along the lines of such a cut, the administration proposed in
January to spend $303.3 billion for the 1991 fiscal year. The House
has passed a more drastic cut to $295.4 billion, while the Senate
Budget Committee has approved an even leaner $293.9 billion plan.
   In testimony on Capitol Hill last week, Cheney said if he were
forced to accept the House proposal, he would be forced to lay off
140,000 military men and women.
   A 25 percent cut in forces, he added, would result in cutting
five or six Army divisions and the same number of Air Force
tactical fighter wings.
   Last week, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams decried the House
and Senate numbers as taking ``a mindless meat ax'' to the defense
budget.
   Cheney's report to the budget negotiators amounts to ``trying to
educate the people who are going to make those budget decisions on
why they should not make big reductions in our budget,'' Williams
said.
   The spokesman accused the House and Senate with coming up with
defense budget figures ``out of thin air,'' dedicated only to
slashing the budget and not taking into account what it would do to
the nation's military force.
   ``Part of the exercise we're going through is to say, guys, if
you swing that ax, this is what you're cutting,'' Williams said.

<HEAD>Man Sets Himself Afire In Police Station Lobby</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TERRELL, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An escaped mental hospital patient
claiming to be Gen. William Westmoreland's son doused himself with
gasoline then set himself afire in a police station lobby this
morning.
   Two police officers rushed the burning man out of the
smoke-filled lobby and rolled him on the lawn to put out the fire.
   The man, Alvin Bray, 45, suffered second- and third-degree burns
over 42 percent of his body, said Colonial Hospital spokesman Mike
Portacci. Bray was expected to be transferred to Parkland Hospital
in nearby Dallas later today.
   ``He said his name was Gen. Westmoreland Jr. and it was a matter
of national security or something like that,'' said Police Chief
David Walker. Westmoreland commanded U.S. forces in Vietnam.
   Bray was sent to the state hospital after claiming to be
Westmoreland's son and attempting to deposit what he said was $1
million into the a bank in Keene on March 30, said Johnson County
Attorney Dale Hanna.
   Walker said Bray tried to deposit $9 million in a local bank
before going to the police station today.
   Walker said Bray already was splattered with gasoline when he
walked into the lobby carrying a bag holding beer bottles and cans
full of gas. He told a woman and a child sitting in the lobby that
they'd better leave, police Sgt. Don Echols said.
   Echols said he went over and tried to calm Bray, then tried to
knock the bag out of Bray's hand as Bray moved to light it. The bag
ignited and flames spread to Bray's body.
   Echols and Sgt. Joe Blair dragged Bray out of the lobby and
smothered the flames. Echols' uniform also caught fire, but he was
not injured.
   Walker said there was some damage to the lobby.
   Bray scaled the hospital fence at about 6:20 a.m. and escaped
officials who chased him, said Don Gilbert, Terrell State Hospital
superintendent.
   Terrell is located 25 miles east of Dallas.

   Volunteer organizations said Tuesday they will
hold simultaneous candlelight vigils in 15 countries this fall to
call attention to the plight of children around the world.
   They are trying to fight preventable diseases that experts say
may kill 100 million children in the next decade.
   ``Over 40,000 children are dying daily of malnutrition and
preventable disease,'' said Sen. Bill Bradley at a news conference
to launch the effort.
   ``The nations of the world must act together to declare that
children are a priority, that they have a right to learn and grow
in peace and freedom,'' the New Jersey Democrat said.
   The candlelight ceremonies are a prelude to the World Summit on
Children to be held at the United Nations on September 29-30.
   They are to begin at sunset Sept. 23 in Australia and other
countries will join in as twilight reaches their part of the world,
ending in the United States in Hawaii.
   ``All the successful communities of the world have become
successful because they have become concerned about the health and
education of their children,'' said James P. Grant, executive
director of the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF), which is helping
organize the summit.
   Nearly 15 million children under five die each year, according
to UNICEF.
   ``One day of the world's expenditures on arms is all it would
take to save the lives of 20,000 children,'' said Grant.
   The summit will bring together heads of governments to develop
solutions to rising child and maternal mortality, malnutrition,
unsafe drinking water and waste disposal, low-birthweight, poverty,
homelessness, inadequate access to basic education and children's
protection.
   The U.S. organizations sponsoring the vigils include Africare,
CARE USA, the Children's Defense Fund, the Child Welfare League of
America, End Hunger Network, Foster Parents Plan, the Hunger
Project, the National Council for International Health, RESULTS,
Save the Children and the U.S. Committee for UNICEF.
   The coalition is urging world leaders to ratify the U.N.
Convention on the Rights of the Child approved last year by the
General Assembly.
   The convention sets minimum standards for the well being of
children and calls for protection from abuse and exploitation and
for certain rights and basic education. It would have the force of
international law if ratified by 20 nations.
   Six countries _ Belize, Ecuador, Guatemala, Ghana, the Vatican
and Vietnam _ have ratified the treaty. The executive branches of
60 others have signed it and are awaiting action by their
legislatures.
   Bradley and other participants urged Americans to launch a
phone-in and letter-writing campaign to urge President Bush to sign
the document and send it to the Senate for ratification.
   Actress Valerie Harper, representing more than 150 entertainers
who plan to participate in the vigils, urged Americans to ``get off
our duff and get this done.''
   ``We are in the course of reviewing the convention to see if it
is in accordance with U.S. law and for other policy aspects,'' said
a State Department spokesman.

<HEAD>Negotiations on East German Reparations for Nazi Crimes Set</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   German and Jewish experts will meet in East
Berlin next week to start negotiating how much East Germany will
pay for the war crimes of Nazi Germany, the World Jewish Congress
announced Tuesday.
   The June 25 meeting follows exploratory talks on the
compensation issue between WJC leaders and East German Prime
Minister Lothar de Maiziere during his visit to New York earlier
this month.
   The negotiations will focus on reparations to Israel and to
Jewish organizations for housing and rehabilitating survivors of
the Nazi Holocaust, said WJC Executive Director Elan Steinberg.
   The scope of the East German payments is uncertain, in large
part because the country is being merged with West Germany which is
assuming responsibility for all East Germany's financial
obligations.
   The talks will not deal with compensation of individual victims
or survivors, just as the 1952 reparations agreement with West
Germany, known as the Luxembourg Agreement, did not address that
issue, Steinberg said.
   The Luxembourg Agreement, which will serve as the model for the
talks with East Germany, only covered West German payments to
Israel and Jewish institutions. The West German parliament later
passed a law providing for compensation of individual claims.
   In all, West Germany has paid more than $40 billion in
reparations over the years. The Luxembourg Agreement stipulated
that West Germany pay two-thirds of the total compensation owed by
the German people.
   For more than 40 years, East Germany's communist leaders refused
to recognize any responsibility for the war crimes and refused to
pay the remaining third of the claims, citing the systematic
persecution of communists by the Nazis.
   One of the first acts of the new democratic East German
parliament elected last March after the communists fell was to
concede a share of the blame for the deeds of the Nazis and their
systematic annihilation of 6 million Jews.
   ``We recognize the very complex nature of these negotiations,''
said Steinberg. ``But we hope they won't be too lengthy.''

   A House Banking Committee member called on
federal regulators today to ``lift the veil of secrecy''
surrounding their investigation of President Bush's son, Neil, in
connection with a Colorado thrift collapse.
   ``If it has brought charges against Neil Bush, it should make
those charges public,'' Rep. Frank Annunzio said, referring to the
federal Office of Thrift Supervision. ``No law or regulation
prevents the agency from revealing the charges.''
   Neil Bush denied any wrongdoing in the collapse of Silverado
Banking, Savings and Loan Association of Denver. He appeared May 23
before the committee, which was probing whether his business
interests in Colorado conflicted with his role as a director of
Silverado. He called allegations of conflict of interest
``frivolous.''
   ``I'm calling on the Office of Thrift Supervision to lift the
veil of secrecy which shrouds this matter,'' Annunzio, D-Ill., said
at the outset of the latest hearing on the Silverado failure.
   Annunzio cited an undated and unsigned internal Office of Thrift
Supervision document which he said contained proposed charges
against Neil Bush. But he said no charges were ever brought, nor
has there been any indication of whether any charges will be
forthcoming from the government.
   ``The last time I checked, Neil Bush's father was the head of
that organization,'' Annunzio said.
   ``Can any agency of the United States fairly and impartially
investigate the son of the president of the United States?'' he
asked.
   Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., defended Neil Bush, noting that he has
declared his innocence and citing a May 22 statement by federal
regulators that they could find no basis for issuing a prohibition
on his further involvement in the banking industry.
   Parris said the document cited by Annunzio ``is undated, it's
unsigned. It was never circulated. It is in fact, a draft. ... Mr.
Bush appeared here voluntarily. ... for eight hours. ... he
believes he is innocent of any wrongdoing.''
   ``I think ... it raises the question, is Neil Bush paying a
penalty because of who he is, not being given some kind of unique
benefits because of who he may be,'' Parris said.
   One focus of the hearings is the length of time it took
regulators to close the thrift after problems developed. The thrift
was closed in late 1988, two years after trouble surfaced.
   ``Nothing has been more costly than regulatory hesitation
through the entire savings and loan crisis,'' committee Chairman
Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, said in an opening statement.
   Meanwhile, the White House blasted Democrats for the S&amp;L crisis.
   ``A big part of the problem here is that in the dead of night a
few years ago, the Democrats pushed through a bill raising the
limits (of coverage for insured deposits) to $100,000 a person,''
said White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater. The increase was
part of a broader, bipartisan bill to overhaul the entire S&amp;L
industry.
   ``I'm saying the Democrats have a big role in it,'' he said.
   Among those subpoenaed to testify were Michael Wise, the former
chairman of Silverado, and Kenneth Good and Bill Walters, Neil
Bush's former business partners.
   Wise was likely to be questioned about his role on the Federal
Reserve Board's Thrift Institutions Advisory Council. Wise was on
the prestigious panel for three years, serving as its president in
1987.
   The advisory group meets with the Fed's board of governors four
times a year to advise it on developments relating to the thrift
industry and other regulatory matters.
   Meantime, Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., acknowledged he wrote
letters in 1984 to Paul Volcker, then the chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board, promoting Wise's appointment to a related panel, the
Fed's Consumer Advisory Council.
   In a handwritten letter to Volcker, Wirth said of Wise: ``He is
extremely able and would be an excellent appointment.'' Copies of
two letters Wirth sent to Volcker were obtained by The Associated
Press from House sources.
   Wirth, who was a House member when he wrote the letters,
received a campaign contribution of $750 from Wise for a Senate bid
in 1985, according to the Federal Election Commission. Wise also
gave to Republicans, including $1,000 to Wirth's 1986 opponent in
the Senate race, Ken Kramer.
   Wirth, who is a member of the Senate Banking Committee, played
down the significance of the letter and blamed its release on
political backbiting.
   He said in a statement that the letter was ``one of hundreds of
letters that I write each year on behalf of my constituents.''
   Wirth recently cosponsored legislation to create a separate
Justice Department division charged with investigating and
prosecuting illegal activity in the savings and loan industry.
   ``We must send a strong message to those in the financial
services industry who violate the law that their actions will be
punished,'' he said last week.
   Meanwhile Monday, Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., called on
President Bush to create an independent commission to investigate
the savings and loan crisis. He said he was disappointed by the
increasingly partisan nature of the debate over how the crisis
occurred.
   Pending in the House is a resolution calling for appointment of
an independent counsel, or special prosecutor, to handle S&amp;L
investigations.
   At an earlier House Banking Committee hearing, Neil Bush, 34,
testified there was no conflict of interest between his business
relationships with Good and Walters and the loans they received
from Silverado.
   But regulators have alleged there was a conflict because Neil
Bush, who had an oil and gas exploration company, didn't tell
Silverado about his separate ties to Good and Walters.

   A New York state trooper bicycling
cross-country to crusade against drunken driving was himself struck
and critically injured by a drunken driver, authorities said.
   Joseph Cyran was less than 40 miles away from his 3,000-mile
goal, Atlantic City, when he was struck by a motorist Saturday
afternoon in this Gloucester County community. He left from Los
Angeles on May 27.
   The motorist apparently fell asleep and crossed the center line
before striking Cyran and carrying him more than 100 feet on the
hood, police said.
   Cyran, 32, of West Seneca, N.Y., near Buffalo, was in fair
condition Tuesday at Cooper Medical Center in Camden, said
spokeswoman Peggy Leone.
   Cyran said Tuesday he hopes to attempt the cross-country journey
again.
   ``You can understand how disappointing it can be pushing every
day, very hard from sunrise to sunset,'' he said in a telephone
interview. ``I'm extremely disappointed that I didn't get to
finish.''
   He suffered a fractured leg, ankle, wrist, thumb, neck and arms.
   ``It could be worse _ I could be paralyzed,'' said Cyran. ``I'll
recover from this.''
   Police said the driver, Ricky Ragunan, 28, of Moorestown, was
charged with driving while intoxicated, careless driving, driving
an unregistered vehicle, using fictitious tags, seatbelt
violations. Ragunan also was issued a summons for failing to have
car insurance, police said.
   ``I hope to goodness that people will read this story and see
what a drunken driver can do to your child or even a loved one''
said Cyran's father, Joseph, in a telephone interview Monday from
his New York home.
   Relatives and friends said Cyran had wanted to raise money for
the victims of drunken drivers. He was unable to obtain sponsors
but decided to make the solo trip anyway, said Trooper Bruce Bell,
Cyran's partner.

<TEXT>
   An Israeli Arab poet was placed under house
arrest Tuesday and faces trial on charges that his poems about the
Palestinian uprising incite violence by Arabs against Jews.
   Shafik Habib is the first Israeli Arab author to be prosecuted
for his writing.
   ``This is a very serious move against an Arab intellectual. This
lit up a red light for all of us,'' said Habib, a father of six who
lives in the northern Israeli village of Deir Hanna.
   Police claimed after Habib's arrest last week that in a
collection of poems titled ``Return to the Future,'' he calls for
the continuation of the uprising and appeals to Arabs to use
firearms and ``kill the Jews.''
   Judge Eitan Magen on Tuesday ordered Habib placed under house
arrest after he was charged with identifying with a terror group
through his writing. Israelis usually mean the PLO when they refer
an unspecified terror organization.
   Magen said Habib must stay at home until further hearings could
be held on a police request that he be jailed until trial. No trial
date was scheduled.
   The Israeli news agency Itim said Habib's passport was seized
and he was ordered to pay a bond of $5,000.
   The charges against Habib come at a time of growing
identification among Israel's 810,000 Arab citizens with the
anti-Israeli revolt of their 1.7 million brethren living in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Last month, after an Israeli gunman killed seven Palestinian
laborers, rioting erupted in many Arab towns and villages within
Israel. Police responded with tear gas and rubber bullets, tactics
they frequently use in the occupied lands but rarely in Israel.
   There are many close ties between Israeli Arabs and those in the
territories. Many in the territories fled from homes that fell
under Israeli control at the founding of the Jewish state in 1948.
   Habib, who defines himself as a ``Palestinian Arab living in
Israel,'' said he used to write love poems until the uprising began
in December 1987.
   Anger over the methods used to crush the revolt prompted him to
change subjects.
   In one of his poems, ``News Bulletin,'' he writes about alleged
army brutality:
   ``The commander has issued an urgent order ... break arms and
legs, smash necks, crush skulls and chase them, leave them as
corpses rotting in the soil.''
   But he denies his work incites violence.
   ``I see something on television, and I write a poem about it.
But it's impossible to encourage stone-throwing. And I know not to
cross the red line. I'm a responsible person,'' he said in a
telephone interview from his home.
   Habib also argued that all the poems in the ``Return to the
Future'' collection had previously been published by Israeli Arab
newspapers, which are subject to censorship.
   The army routinely reviews material submitted to Arabic-language
newspapers in Israel and the occupied lands, and it frequently bans
publication of items.
   Israeli Arab leaders said the charges against Habib violated
free speech and contradicted Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's pledge
that his new right-wing government would seek peace.
   ``This regime is very weak if they are afraid of words. We are
not talking about stones or bombs,'' said legislator Abdul Wahab
Darousha.

   Gunmen demanded money from an armored truck guard
_ and he gave it to them: He swung a bag full of cash at a
shotgun-wielding assailant to foil the robbery, police said.
   The unidentified guard for the Illinois Armored Car Corp. was

Police Sgt. Barbara Matula.
   As two more masked gunmen appeared, the guard swung a canvas bag
filled with $18,000 in cash and coins at the would-be robber,
knocking away his shotgun, Matula said. The guard jumped back in
the truck with his partner and the two put their heads down as the
gunmen fired three shots before fleeing, she said.
   No cash was lost and no one was hurt.
   Company officials praised the guard.
   ``He's to be commended for doing a job well done,'' said Ted
Bone, spokesman for the company.

   A dinosaur roamed the Earth briefly _ or
at least that stretch of Earth that lies between the Sinclair and
Amoco gas stations on U.S. Highway 6.
   The dinosaur _ the familiar brontosaur that is Sinclair's
corporate symbol _ floated loose from its mooring outside the
Sinclair station during Monday's floods and cruised along the
highway in this southeastern Iowa town.
   ``We decided to go lasso it before it got down to Amoco or
something and deserted us for good,'' Sinclair Marketing manager
Dave Arenstdorf said. ``It was something to see, all those cars
honking at the dinosaur.''
   Arenstdorf said the dinosaur was roped and tied to a telephone
pole, where it will remain until it can be moved later this week.

<HEAD>Landsbergis: Lithuania Will Move Slowly on Idea to Suspend
Independence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lithuania's president made clear Tuesday that his
republic's legislature will not rush to consider Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's proposal to suspend its declaration of independence.
   The Lithuanian pro-independence group Sajudis staged a rally
outside the parliament building in the republic's capital of
Vilnius to oppose suspension of the March 11 act of independence,
the news agency Interfax reported.
   In an effort to break the Kremlin's impasse with the Baltics,
Gorbachev last week offered to end his economic embargo against
Lithuania and conduct negotiations. In return, he asked Lithuania
to freeze implementation of its declaration of independence.
   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis told lawmakers the
proposal would not be considered by the full parliament until the
republic's prime minister returns from a foreign trip.
   ``I think that today there isn't such a compelling reason to
begin debates without clarifying (our position) beforehand in
commissions and groups,'' Landsbergis told parliament. His comment
was reported by Haroldus Subacius, a parliamentary spokesman.
   Lithuania's Council of Ministers, or Cabinet, accepted the
moratorium proposal Saturday and asked the Supreme Council, or
parliament, to endorse it as well.
   The Lithuanian government, under Prime Minister Kazimiera
Prunskiene, is considered far more disposed to compromise with the
Kremlin than the parliament, which is headed by Landsbergis and
dominated by members of Sajudis.
   Subacius' account of Landsbergis' comments differed markedly
from a report given by the Soviet Union's official Tass news
agency. Tass quoted Landsbergis as saying in a radio broadcast:
``The Supreme Council of Lithuania will not discuss the proposal of
the government in the form in which it was received, won't vote for
or against it today, this week and perhaps, ever.''
   Subacius denied the Lithuanian president made the remark. He
said Landsbergis made it clear the proposal on the moratorium would
eventually be discussed.
   There was no explanation for the conflicting reports.
   Mrs. Prunskiene was visiting Greece and not expected to return
until Friday, Subacius said in a telephone interview.
   Lithuania was forcibly absorbed into the Soviet Union in 1940,
along with the republics of Latvia and Estonia. Those republics
have declared they want to regain their independence, but they have
taken a slower approach than Lithuania.

<HEAD>White House Says It's Willing To Compromise on Civil Rights Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House said Tuesday it was willing to
compromise on the Civil Rights Act of 1990 to avoid a presidential
veto, but a key GOP senator voiced skepticism that such a deal
could be struck before Nelson Mandela's visit to Washington.
   ``I don't think anybody wants to see the president veto any
civil rights bill. But on the other hand, he's made it quite clear
that he wants it changed and he wants the changes to work,'' Sen.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, told reporters after a meeting with Bush.
   The civil rights dispute dominated the agenda of Bush's Tuesday
meeting with GOP congressional leaders. But participants emerged
from the session suggesting a compromise on the issue did not
appear to be at hand.
   The administration has been discussing possible compromises in
hopes of avoiding a battle over the bill during Mandela's visit.
The African National Congress leader meets with Bush on Monday.
   Hatch, a senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee,
said that because the issue is so contentious, he did not believe a
deal could be struck before Mandela arrives.
   In addition, he cautioned against Democrats bringing the matter
to the Senate floor during Mandela's visit to try to embarrass the
administration.
   ``This deserves more consideration than that,'' Hatch said.
   The legislation, cosponsored by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
and Augustus F. Hawkins, D-Calif, would overcome a series of
Supreme Court decisions last year that made it harder for workers
to bring discrimination suits against employers.
   The administration claims that the bill, as drafted, would in
effect force businesses to resort to hiring quotas to reduce their
exposure to lawsuits; sponsors deny that the bill requires quotas,
directly or indirectly.
   President Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said after
Tuesday's White House meeting: ``He does not want to veto the bill;
he wants a civil rights bill he can sign.''
   But, Fitzwater added, ``We're willing to veto this bill if it is
a quota bill. This is the bottom line.''
   Fitzwater said the possibility that the bill might come up in
the Senate during Mandela's visit came up at the White House
meeting ``but there was no concern about it.''
   Fitzwater said that while ``we're not there yet'' in terms of a
compromise, ``the consensus of everybody'' at the GOP meeting,
including some Republican cosponsors of the bill, was that ``they
want something to be for.''
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh briefed GOP senators at the
White House session on possible administration-backed compromises
in wording that would avoid the quota problem.
   ``We'll be doing some heavy negotiating,'' said Sen. Alan
Simpson, R-Wyo.

<HEAD>Foreign Species Invading U.S. Waters, Experts Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The zebra mussel is one of many exotic species
invading U.S. waters, and a broad strategy is needed to keep them
from wreaking economic and environmental havoc, experts said
Tuesday.
   The river ruffe, spiny water flea and tube-nosed goby soon may
become as familiar to the Great Lakes as the zebra mussel,
witnesses said at a hearing of the Senate Subcommittee on
Environmental Protection.
   Meanwhile, the asiatic clam, Japanese seaweed and the red tide
are damaging shellfish and marine industries along the ocean coasts.
   The newcomers threaten many native species, interrupt the food
chain and pose a danger to the U.S. fishing industry and other
segments of the economy, said Gillman D. Veith, director of the
Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Research and
Development.
   ``Given the rate of technological change and movement of people,
it is likely that the problems resulting from invasions of
non-native species will increase,'' said Veith.
   The city of Monroe, Mich., was forced to ration water for
several days and spend $500,000 removing zebra mussels from its
water intake pipe last year, said Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis. Shipping,
tourism, paper production and other industries could be affected if
such problems become widespread, he said.
   ``There is growing concern that the introduction of
non-indigenous species by ships, particularly through their ballast
water, has affected the ecosystems and economies of countries
around the world,'' said Capt. Thomas E. Thompson of the U.S. Coast
Guard.
   Bills pending in the House and Senate would order the Coast
Guard to develop and enforce regulations on dumping of ships'
ballast water _ the suspected source of zebra mussels, which are
native to fresh-water bodies of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
   The tiny bivalves with zebra-like stripes have spread with
lightning speed through the Great Lakes since their arrival in
1986. They fasten themselves to hard surfaces, such as pipes and
boat hulls, and ingest plankton essential to the aquatic food chain.
   Senators from the region urged quick action and braodening the
scopes of the bills to deal with other natural invaders.

<NOTE>EDs: New throughout with Cheney, Pentagon's revised figures on
wounded</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon revised its figures today on the
number of soldiers accidentally wounded by their comrades in the
Panama invasion, saying 16 of the 310 servicemen wounded in action
were hit by ``friendly fire.''
   On Monday, the Defense Department released figures showing that
two soldiers _ and possibly three _ of the 23 killed during the
Dec. 20 military operation had been killed in such a manner. As
well, the department had originally said 19 of the 324 soldiers
wounded in action had been hit accidentally by their comrades.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams told reporters that the
department had refined the figures in an overnight study of the
death reports. The review was prompted by a Newsweek magazine
report that nine U.S. soldiers had been killed by their comrades
and that more than 60 percent of the casualties had been caused by
friendly fire.
   In his first comment on the issue, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
lamented the deaths, saying such things will occur in complex,
night military operations where high-tech weaponry is used.
   ``I wished it had not happened, on the other hand I don't think
it detracts from the overall quality of the operation,'' he told
reporters after a Pentagon briefing on the budget.
   Williams, in his briefing, said that of the 23 killed in action,
two Rangers were killed by friendly fire at Rio Hato ``during an
intense fire fight with the PDF (Panamanian Defense Force) near
dawn.''
   He added that there was one other possible death due to friendly
fire, and that it was under investigation.
   ``Of the 310 wounded in action, it now appears that 16 were
wounded by friendly fire in several isolated incidents throughout
Panama,'' Williams said.
   ``Yesterday's report of 19 wounded in action included some
accidental injuries that we have now determined were not caused by
hostile fire,'' the spokesman said, adding that since the cases
were being looked at very closely, the numbers could change again.
   Williams added that another 21 wounded during an intense night
fire fight near the Commandancia, the headquarters of Gen. Manuel
Noriega, ``may be the result either of friendly fire from an AC-130
gun ship or PDF mortar fire. It is impossible to distinguish
whether they were wounded by friendly fire or by enemy fire.''
   If those Americans were wounded by the gunship, the incident
might have been caught on the videotape that every AC-130 gunship
shots of its mission. But Williams said he did not know that for
certain and was looking into it.
   Williams said the Pentagon has looked into every case and deeply
regrets any loss of life, for whatever reason.
   ``Nothing can diminish the sacrifices that all these men made to
their country. Casualties caused by friendly fire are an
unfortunate circumstance of war,'' he said.
   The report in the June 25 Newsweek issue quoted unidentified
military officials as the source of its information.
   Williams said confusion over the deaths could have arisen
because Noriega's troops used U.S.-supplied bullets and weapons.

   The value of U.S. agricultural exports dropped
slightly in April from year-earlier levels, an Agriculture
Department report said Tuesday.
   A listing of products shipped to foreign buyers showed their
value at $3.35 billion, down from $3.42 billion in April 1989.
However, the cumulative value since the fiscal year began Oct. 1
was up, totaling $25.3 billion for the seven months against $24.6
billion a year earlier.
   The value of corn exports in April rose slightly, to $577.2
million from $546 million a year ago, with the Soviet Union the
biggest buyer, replacing Japan, the traditional leader.
   Other big corn buyers during the month were Taiwan, Spain, South
Korea and Mexico.
   But wheat exports dropped sharply in April, to $354.9 million
from $514.5 million a year earlier. The Soviet Union remained the
largest market, followed by Japan, China, Algeria, Egypt, Taiwan
and Venezuela.
   The monthly report showed soybean exports dropped to $276.5
million from $314.5 million in April 1989.
   ``Shipments to the (European Economic Community) fell
significantly, accounting for most of the decline,'' the report
said. ``Other major markets included Japan, Taiwan and Korea.''
   Cotton shipments in April were shown at a value of $251.7
million, up from $185.7 million a year earlier.
   Exports of livestock and livestock products in April totaled
more than $538.7 million, compared with $531.4 million in April
1989.
   Total U.S. agricultural exports in the current fiscal year are
forecast at $40 billion, up from $39.6 billion in 1988-89 and the
most since they hit a record of $43.8 billion in 1980-81.

<HEAD>Shevardnadze Blames Soviets for Chemical Arms Buildup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze blamed
Soviet officials for fueling a chemical arms buildup ``to win an
honor banner of socialist competition.''
   The outspoken Soviet diplomat said in an interview with New
Times, a Soviet weekly, that people were correct to point out
imbalances in the weapons stocks of East and West and that those
responsible for Soviet advantages acted irresponsibly.
   ``Those who, apparently not in a struggle with imperialism but
in a drive to win an honor banner of socialist competition poured
barrels' full of chemical poisons at a time when the world had
stopped producing them already, should be called to account,''
Shevardnadze said.
   The edition of New Times containing the interview was scheduled
for release Friday. The Associated Press obtained an advance copy
Tuesday from Soviet sources.
   Shevardnadze's admission that the Soviet side was to blame for
imbalances in chemical weapons stocks came a few weeks after
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Bush signed an
agreement on the issue in Washington.
   The pact, concluded when the U.S. and Soviet foreign ministers
met in Moscow in May, requires the superpowers to destroy 80
percent of their chemical weapons immediately. They would reduce
their stocks to 2 percent of existing levels in the next eight
years, and destroy the rest two years later if all other countries
capable of producing chemical weapons join them in a global ban,
officials said.
   The United States has an estimated 30,000 tons and the Soviets
50,000 tons of the weapons, according to government sources and
independent experts.
   In the interview, Shevardnadze did not identify which Soviet
officials were responsible for the chemical weapons buildup, which
he cited as an example of overall bad policy in the arms race.
   ``Our partners act like a rational hostess who buys only as much
food as she needs to fix a lunch. When the guests leave, she's not
left with a lot to throw away. We had a different psychology: buy
everything and as much as possible, only to discover later a mound
of excess,'' he said.

   Erik Wold, chief of Associated Press
operations in Norway for nearly 19 years, died Tuesday. He was 63
and had served the AP in Norway since 1953.
   Wold's daughter, Jorunn Lie, said he suffered an apparent stroke
at home. He was taken to a hospital and died within 20 minutes.
   Wold, a Norwegian, was born Aug. 4, 1926, in Asker, outside
Oslo. He graduated from Oslo Commercial College and joined the AP
in Oslo in 1953 after working as a free-lance correspondent for
Norwegian newspapers. He became news editor of the Oslo bureau in
1964 and was named chief of bureau in July 1971.
   AP President and General Manager Louis D. Boccardi said, ``Erik
Wold represented a generation of AP bureau chiefs who wrote the
book on how to do the job.''
   ``He knew his territory, his subscribers and his mission. And he
gave every ounce of his energy for all three. We will miss him
greatly.''
   An amateur ski jumper in his youth, Wold retained a lifelong
interest in sports. He was a veteran correspondent for AP at
Olympic Games and world and Nordic skiing championships.
   Wold is survived by his wife, Randi, a brother, four children
and seven grandchildren.
   Funeral plans were incomplete.

   A former landlady was ordered today to
stand trial on charges of murdering nine elderly tenants of her
boardinghouse in order to get their pension and disability benefits.
   Sacramento County Municipal Court Judge Gail Ohanesian,
culminating a five-week preliminary hearing, ruled that the
61-year-old Dorothea Puente should be arraigned in Superior Court
on July 10.
   ``I do find that there is ample evidence that death was by
criminal means,'' she said, in ordering Puente to stand trial on
all the counts with which she had been charged.
   Puente was arrested after a social worker complained that one of
her clients _ a roomer in Puente's home _ had disappeared. In
November 1988, authorities dug up seven bodies from the grounds of
the home, a Victorian-style welling in downtown Sacramento.
   Puente was later linked to two other deaths.
   Prosecutors said Puente had a record of administering stupefying
drugs to intended robbery victims, and contended the matronly
ex-convict killed her victims for their Social Security and
government benefit checks.
   Defense attorneys said the tenants who died, ranging in age from
52 to 80 and mostly poor and alcoholic, did so either by natural
causes or suicide. Among the victim's ailments were a brain tumor,
lung disease, heart disease and diabetes.
   Puente has pleaded innocent. She could face the death penalty if
convicted.
   The judge's ruling came more than seven weeks after the start of
Puente's preliminary hearing on April 27, but two of those weeks
were spent in recess as defense lawyers prepared their case.
   The hearing featured testimony by 70 prosecution witnesses and
at least eight defense witnesses, and more than 100 exhibits.
   Puente displayed little emotion throughout her hearing. She sat
quietly at the defense table, occasionally writing notes to or
leaning over to whisper to her attorneys.

   When it's misty, the chances are not
certain that plans for a celebrity dedication will work out.
   That's what the director of the new Anderson Civic Center found
out Monday at a ceremony to name a street after singer Johnny
Mathis.
   Civic center Director Martin Durham said Mathis was to have
entered the parking lot in a convertible Rolls-Royce to cut the
ribbon for the dedication of Johnny Mathis Boulevard. But he said
Mathis didn't want to come out in the rain, and the owner of the
Rolls-Royce did not want his car driven with the top down.
   ``What are you going to do?'' Durham said. ``The rain ruined
it.''
   The street was named after Mathis because he was the first
person to perform at the center.
   The singer remained in his dressing room during the ceremony to
prepare for Monday night's concert, the first at the 4,500-seat
civic center. He performed with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra
before a crowd of about 2,500.
   A message left with Johnny Mathis' publicist, Skip Heinecke, was
not immediately returned Tuesday.

   Dame Joan Sutherland says she wants to be
remembered for her voice in its prime, so she has withdrawn from
what were to be her last appearances in Covent Garden later this
year.
   The 63-year-old diva had been cast in the lead role of ``Die
Fledermaus'' in December; instead, her final opera appearance will
be in Sydney on Oct. 2 in ``Les Huguenots,'' Royal Opera House
spokeswoman Katherine Wilkinson said Tuesday. The Covent Garden
performance was to be the last of her career.
   ``Dame Joan _ out of respect for Covent Garden and its public _
does not feel able to sing the part of Rosalinde as she feels that
she wishes to be remembered by her past performances and would hate
to disappoint the public by proceeding with `Die Fledermaus',''
said her London manager, Howard Hartog, in a message to the Royal
Opera management.
   ``Dame Joan is one of the great singers of all time, and Covent
Garden was privileged to be her `home' opera house for the early
years of her career, beginning in 1952,'' said Paul Finlay, the
Royal Opera's director.

   Singer Anita Baker and her husband are asking
$950,000 for a historic house that they bought for $575,000 and had
once planned to demolish, the Detroit Free Press reported Tuesday.
   Baker, whose hits include ``Giving Him the Best that I've Got,''
and her husband, Walter Bridgforth, had said they wanted to put up
an unspecified project at the site of the Chene House.
   The house was built in 1855 and most recently home for the
now-closed Little Harry's restaurant.
   The building's historic designation stands in the way of its
demolition, but failure to find a buyer for the house could lead to
a hardship exemption from Detroit's landmark protection laws.
   The couple's attorney, Renee McDuffee, did not immediately
return a telephone call Tuesday to The Associated Press for comment.
   The house was built by the Chene family on land it received from
the king of France in the early 1700s.

   ``It is always a great pleasure for me to return to the country
of my parents, relatives and friends _ especially to take part in
efforts to deepen the friendship between Italy and New York
state,'' Mrs. Cuomo said shortly before signing the documents.
   The wife of Gov. Mario Cuomo is on a weeklong visit to promote

anniversary of Christopher Columbus' discovery of America.
   She signed the accords as the co-chairwoman of the New York
state program that promotes cooperation with Italy.
   Under one of the agreements, Italy's National Research Council
will exchange information and scientists with the New York State
Science and Technology Foundation.
   Through another accord, the Italian council will set up research
fellowships with the Graduate School of Public Health at the State
University of New York and share information on health issues.
   Mrs. Cuomo told reporters she also was working with Italy's hot
line to aid abused children. New York state will participate in
Italy's first national conference on child abuse in May 1991, she

<HEAD>Controllers' Union Say Problems Plague Control Chicago-area Center</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An air traffic control center handling 2 million
flights a year has had more than 500 radio communication glitches
this year, creating a hazard in the skies, union officials said.
   Six of about 40 sectors of airspace controlled by the center
have suffered total radio failure during the last year, leaving
controllers and pilots with no way to communicate, said James
Poole, president of the National Air Traffic Controller Association
chapter at the center.
   Union officials contended Monday that the center is fraught with
aging radio equipment, lack of funding and bureaucratic delays in
making repairs.
   The regional center in suburban Chicago controls planes over the
central Midwest, including those bound for O'Hare International
Airport.
   Mort Edelstein, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation
Administration, acknowledged some problems at the center, but said
the FAA is taking steps to correct them.
   He said agency experts say the center is safe. He contended
there has been no case of loss of proper distance between planes
due to radio problems in the last three years.
   Poole said the duration of the communication blackouts in the
six airspace sectors ranged from about two minutes to about two
hours. They came after failure of three separate communications
systems, he said.
   ``The air traffic system is extremely safe when everything is
working,'' said Mark Scholl, chairman of the union chapter's safety
committee. ``When you can't talk to the airplanes, the system is
not safe.''
   Edelstein said communications improvements at the center have
been extensive since April 1987. The FAA has earmarked $740,000 to
upgrade radio channels and the work is to be completed by November,
he said.

   One of about 30 to 50 Florida panthers
believed to be surviving in the wild was struck and killed by a
car, game officials said Tuesday.
   It was the fourth of the endangered animals known to have died
this year.
   The 50-pound, 10-month-old male was run over Monday while
crossing a remote road about six miles north of the Big Cypress
Seminole Indian Reservation in the Everglades.
   It was the 13th road kill of a panther since July 1984,
commission records show. ``It's the leading contributor to their
demise right now,'' said a commission spokesman, Lt. Jim Huffstodt.
   The previous panther deaths this year were from other causes.
   Walter McGowan, a biologist with the Florida Game and Fresh
Water Fish Commission, said that although the deaths are
disturbing, the panther population seems to have held its own or
grown slightly during the past decade.
   ``The animals we are following are reproducing and having young
consistently, and they seem to be replacing themselves,'' he said.
``But on the larger question of panther survival, we just have no
really hard answers.''

   An Associated Press survey of Congress shows
that the vote on President Bush's anti-flag-burning amendment is
too close to call _ with undecided moderate Democrats in control of
its fate.
   Neither side in the politically charged battle could yet claim
victory, according to the survey. The amendment was short of the
required two-thirds majority in both chambers but still could go
over the top in the showdown just before Congress' Fourth of July
recess.
   The House may vote as early as Thursday and the Senate by the
end of next week.
   ``I don't know what the vote outcome will be. I expect it will
be close,'' Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said
Monday.
   In the Senate, where 67 votes are needed to pass the amendment,
58 lawmakers surveyed favored it or were leaning in that direction,
while 24 were against or leaning against. Of the 18 who did not
take a position, 15 were Democrats.
   Supporters and those leaning in favor outnumbered opponents 254
to 114 in the House, where 289 votes are required for passage. Of
the 65 who were undecided or had no known position, 54 were
Democrats.
   The telephone survey was conducted late last week and Monday.
Some lawmakers responded in person and some through aides.
   House Democratic and Republican leaders were working furiously
behind closed doors to sway the undecideds in the final days before
the vote.
   Both camps said they had won over some of the swing votes even
though they stayed publicly uncommitted, and both sides predicted
the outcome could hinge on the decisions of a half-dozen lawmakers.
   The fact that the survey found so many Democrats still on the
fence illustrates the political difficulty of the issue for the
party.
   Republican campaign operatives have promised to use the flag
vote to portray Democrats opposing the amendment as less patriotic
than their GOP challengers, and it's already an issue in many races.
   In the face of the GOP threat, the Democratic leadership in both
chambers has remained strongly against the amendment as a weakening
of the First Amendment. But in deference to the divisions in the
party and to those members with tough challenges, they have been
careful not to make it a ``party'' position.
   Mitchell kept up his rhetorical pressure Monday, saying that
approval of the amendment would provide a victory for flag-burners
who seek to goad the nation's leaders.
   ``It will be a sad irony if a few obnoxious publicity seekers
... are able to stampede those who love America'' into changing the
Bill of Rights, he said.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., has spoken out repeatedly
against the amendment and has said he would vote against it, making
a rare exception to the tradition of the speaker not voting.
   Even that one vote could make the difference.
   The survey showed that while the amendment is favored by the
vast majority of Republicans in each chamber and has divided the
Democrats, there are many curious exceptions to the ideological
pattern.
   Some of the most conservative Republicans, such as Sen. Gordon
Humphrey, R-N.H., came out against the amendment while many liberal
Democrats supported it.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., has spoken out against the
amendment while his nephew, Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy, D-Mass., said
he was undecided.
   Some Senate Democrats with tough races _ those who might seek
political safety by voting for the flag amendment _ weren't
necessarily doing so.
   Sens. Daniel Akaka, D-Hawaii; Paul Simon, D-Ill.; Claiborne
Pell, D-R.I.; and Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, all came out against the
amendment. Akaka, Simon and Harkin face challengers who plan to
vote for the amendment in the House.
   Pell's challenger, Rep. Claudine Schneider, R-R.I., said she
also would vote against the amendment.
   Flag symbolism was used adroitly by Bush in his 1988
presidential campaign against Democrat Michael Dukakis, and
Democrats still fear it.
   Among congressional Democrats who have been mentioned for the
1992 presidential race, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, put himself in
the ``leaning yes'' category while Sens. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., and
Bill Bradley, D-N.J., listed themselves as uncommitted. Sen.
Charles Robb, D-Va., said yes.
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., has bucked the tide by coming out
strongly against the amendment and accusing Bush of trying to use
the issue to reopen the generational animosities of the Vietnam
war. Kerry won a Medal of Honor in Vietnam.

<HEAD>Proposed Tax Change Would Lessen Mortgage Interest Deduction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Experts who advise Congress on taxes
recommended a simplification package Tuesday that could dilute the
deduction for home mortgage interest.
   Two of three proposals for simplifying the tax treatment of
non-business interest would mean less than a full deduction of
mortgage interest for many homeowners. The third option would
retain the existing deduction for mortgage interest.
   Either of the three recommendations would allow a deduction for
at least some consumer interest, including credit cards. Under
present law, only 10 percent of consumer interest is deductible for
1990; starting next year, no such deduction will be allowed.
   Overhaul of the deduction for non-business interest was the most
dramatic of a series of changes proposed in the name of
simplification by the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation. The
recommendations were made to Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.,
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, who earlier this
year announced a renewed effort to simplify the tax laws.
   Rostenkowski released the proposals from the staff of the Joint
Committee, along with some from the Treasury Department and others
from the Democratic staff of his own committee. The committee also
received hundreds of pages of simplification suggestions from tax
professionals and the public in general.
   ``At the least, we will have hearings on the proposals in the
fall,'' said a spokesman for Ways and Means. Those hearings will
help determine whether an effort will be made to write a
simplification bill, he said.
   Treasury and the Ways and Means staff offered their own
proposals for simplifying the interest deduction, but neither went
so far as the Joint Committee proposal. That proposal included
these options:
   _ Combine all non-business interest, including for mortgages,
consumer debt and investment borrowing, and deduct a set
percentage, perhaps 75 percent.
   _ Deduct interest equal to net income on investments, plus some
additionl dollar amount.
   _ Retain a deduction, as under present law, for mortgage
interest and allow a separate writeoff for other interest, limited
to net investment income. The portion of other interest that could
not be deducted in the first year because of the limitation could
be carried over into future years.
   The Joint Committee staff said either of the recommendations
would minimize complexity of present law. In addition, the first
option would remove the ``incentive for individuals to structure
loans as home-equity debt in order to avoid the present-law limit
on the deductibilty of personal interest,'' the report stated.
   Present law has one set of rules for mortgage interest, another
for investment interest and a third for credit cards and other
consumer debt.
   The Treasury Department said there is a need to simplify the
paperwork burden on families who employ domestics and other
household workers.
   The department said it is not ready to make a specific
recommendation but is exploring the feasibility of requiring
annual, rather than quarterly, tax filings by household employers.

   The defendant in criminal case No. 90-0068
wore a red carnation in his left lapel as he arrived at U.S.
District Court at the last minute. He seemed in low spirits.
   Not a word passed between Marion Barry, mayor of the District of
Columbia, and his wife, Effi, as they walked slowly down the
hallway.
   They seemed in no hurry to get to the courtroom on the second
floor.
   Few events _ save, of course, the verdict _ are as tough on the
defendant in a criminal trial as the opening statements by lawyers.
That's when the gloves come off and the defendant hears the
allegations put in the harshest possible light.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Roberts called Barry a dope
user, a liar and a hypocrite.
   As the mayor looked down at the defense table and fidgeted with
paper and pen, Roberts said Barry was preaching against using drugs
while ``snorting dope up his nose.'' Using hand gestures Roberts
said a videotape would show Barry smoking crack ``just like this.''
   Barry averted his eyes.
   Defense lawyer Kenneth Mundy painted a different picture of the
former Eagle Scout charged with possessing cocaine and lying to a
grand jury. He said the mayor was trapped by prosecutors who
``provided the drugs and the pipe.''
   Mundy was particularly scornful of Charles Lewis, a convicted
drug dealer and the major government witness. Lewis, Mundy said,
``was willing to put to music any tune the government wanted him to
play.''
   In the front row, scarcely five feet behind her husband, sat
Effi Barry, the 54-year-old mayor's third wife.
   Barry is a 1960s civil rights activist who organized lunch
counter sit-ins, demonstrations and boycotts in the South. He first
was elected mayor in 1978.
   The mayor's limousine arrived at a side door of the courthouse
only three minutes before the start of the 10 a.m. trial. Barry was
in the back seat with his coat off.
   News photographers were on all four sides of the building, but
the heaviest concentration had their lenses aimed at the circular
driveway where the limousine pulled up. Barry obliged them with a
wan smile and a wave as he put on his coat.
   The smile vanished in the near-empty courthouse corridor. A
reporter asked the mayor how he felt and Barry managed a ``fine.''
Courthouse guards, whose habit it is to be deferential to celebrity
defendants, cleared a path through a non-existent crowd.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's courtroom is the
same one used by U.S. District Judge John J. Sirica for the
Watergate cover-up trial 15 years ago.
   About 80 people waited to get into the courtroom; only a dozen
made it.
   In the past, as the mayor's case moved toward trial, there had
been demonstrations outside the courthouse, tinged with accusations
that the case against Barry would never have been brought were he
not black.
   U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens is white.
   But there were no demonstrators on this first day. The city's
business went on as usual.
   In Washington's city hall, 10 blocks away from the courthouse,
Councilwoman Betty Ann Kane introduced a resolution calling on
Barry to work for a voluntary early retirement program for city
employees.
   Barry has already announced he won't seek a fourth term, but
pointedly said he would not retire early.

   As it has for the past decade, New York is
importing a dash of genuine ticker tape to give an old-time flavor
to Nelson Mandela's parade on Wednesday.
   About 150 miles of the inch-wide paper ribbon was shipped here
Friday in 85 plastic bags from Trans-Lux Corp. in Norwalk, Conn.,
which believes it is the last supplier in what once was a nation of
stock tickers and tape. Computers have almost completely replaced
tickers.
   The city still calls a ride through its ``Canyon of Heroes'' on
lower Broadway a ``ticker-tape parade,'' although what snows down
on the lionized these days is mainly computer cards and fanfold
printout paper.
   Oldtimers say the cards simply cannot duplicate the look of
streaming ticker tape, the ``blizzard effect'' one sees in film of
the great parade for Charles A. Lindbergh in 1927.
   ``But with a token amount of tape, mixed with all the other
confetti, Mandela will know he's having a ticker-tape parade,''
said Trans-Lux spokesman Matt Brandt.
   City Sanitation Department spokesman Vito Turso suggested that
the best stuff to shower on Mandela, from environmental and
economic points of view, would be shredded old telephone
directories.
   ``Also, fax paper, which is not recyclable,'' he said. ``But
manila stock IBM cards are worth $320 a ton from a recycler,
computer paper $220 a ton and white bond $180 a ton.''
   Among recent ticker-tape parades the Lower Broadway:
   1986 _ New York Mets, after beating the Boston Red Sox in the
World Series.
   1985 _ 25,000 Vietnam veterans, led by Gen. William Westmoreland
and 26 Medal of Honor winners, in a 10-years-overdue welcome-home
tribute.
   1984 _ 221 athletes of the U.S. Olympic team are cheered, but
101 spectators are injured when a construction scaffold on the
parade route gives way.
   1981 _ Welcome home for the Americans hostages freed from Iran.
   1979 _ Pope John Paul II.

<HEAD>Few Teachers Use Alternative Programs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of states with alternative routes
for certifying teachers is growing but few focus on recruiting
older, educated adults with real-life experiences, a study said
Tuesday.
   Emily Feistritzer, director of the National Center for Education
Information, said a study found that most alternative teacher
certification programs _ for people who have not completed a
traditional college teacher education program _ are tied to teacher
shortages.
   Since the shortages have not materialized as educators
originally had predicted, very few teachers are entering the
profession through the alternate routes, she said.
   ``Very few states in this nation have actually designed a
certification path specifically to meet the demand created by the
new and growing market of adults who already have at least a
bachelor's degree and want to teach,'' said Feistritzer.
   Connecticut, New Jersey, Texas, Arizona and Arkansas are the
best at opening their schools to such would-be teachers, because
job offers are available to people who have a bachelor's degree in
any subject, according to the study.
   However, Arizona accepts such teachers only at the secondary
school level, and Arkansas uses them only when there are teacher
shortages.
   The United States has hired about 1 million new teachers in the
last five years, but only about 12,000 have been certified through
alternative teacher certification routes since 1985.
   The center, a private education research organization, conducted
a state-by-state study from December 1989 to May 1990. Thirty-three
states report they are implementing alternative routes to the
state-approved college teacher education program for certifying
teachers _ up from 23 less than two years ago. Eight states were
implementing alternatives in 1983.
   About a third of the states say they use alternative routes only
if a traditionally certified teacher cannot be found, the study
said.
   There is enormous variation in the alternative routes, the study
found. However, it said most states require a bachelor's degree, at
least a ``C&plus;'' college grade average and passage of a basic skills
test and sometimes a specialty area test.
   The study said Connecticut, New Jersey and Texas have about the
best state-designed alternative programs available in all fields at
all grade levels. Arizona, Idaho, Louisiana, Ohio and Virginia
offer programs only at the secondary level.
   States that offer alternative programs only in areas of teacher
shortages are Alabama, Arkansas, California, Georgia, Maine, New
York, Oregon and South Carolina. Hawaii, Missouri and Oklahoma
offer alternative programs only in shortage areas at the high
school level.
   Some states, the study said, favor emergency licensing.
Emergency certificates usually are issued at a superintendent's
request and allow people to begin teaching fulltime while taking
courses in traditional teacher education programs.
   Census Bureau statistics show that in 1970, there were 4 million
more children of school age, 5 to 17 years old, than there were
adults between the ages of 25 and 44 years. Today, there are 34
million more adults in that age category alone than there are
children between 5 and 17 years.
   In 1970, one in 10 of the 110 million adults 25 years and older
had a college degree, the statistics show. Today, one in five of
the 150 million do. The Bureau of Labor Statistics says one in four
college graduates in the work force holds a job that does not
require a college degree.
   Feistritzer said the United States has an opportunity it has
never had before _ ``to bring adults who are educated, who have
experience in the real world and who have a passion for improving
the nation's educational system into its teaching force.''

<TEXT>
   The U.S. ambassador to Romania will boycott
the presidential inauguration in Bucharest on Wednesday to show
concern over the ``government-inspired mob violence'' last week
against peaceful demonstrators, a spokesman said Tuesday.
   Deputy State Department spokesman Richard Boucher also expressed
distress that the Romanian government had taken no action against
coal miners and others responsible for the attacks against the
demonstrators.
   The inauguration of President Ion Iliescu, who has headed an
interim government in Romania since last December, had been
scheduled for last week but was postponed until Wednesday because
of the turmoil.
   Boucher said other envoys in Bucharest were planning to join
Ambassador Alan Green in boycotting the inauguration. He was unable
to say how many may do so.
   Green returned to Romania on Monday after consultations in
Washington. He met Tuesday with leaders of two opposition parties
and with members of a non-partisan organization. One of the party
headquarters had been ``ransacked during the government-inspired
mob violence last week,'' Boucher said.
   Boucher renewed the U.S. government's call for the release of
the more than 1,000 people who he said were arrested for protesting
peacefully.
   ``We call on the government to ensure that fundamental human
rights and the rule of law apply equally to all Romanian
decisions,'' he said.
   Boucher also criticized a Romanian parliamentary chamber for
approving on Monday a proposal to give police and soldiers the
authority to move against anti-government demonstrators assembled
in a Bucharest square, saying that could suppress dissent.
   Boucher also urged that the secret police be dismantled and that
legitimate national security concerns be subordinated to democratic
controls.
   The disturbances last week erupted less than a month after
Iliescu won election to the presidency by a wide margin. His
critics suspect him of continuing to harbor the communist
sympathies he once espoused when he was associated with the regime
of President Nicolae Ceausescu, who was ousted in a bloody revolt
last December. Ceausescu fired Iliescu in 1984.
   Boucher announced last Friday that all non-humanitarian aid
would be withheld from Romania because of the actions against the
protestors. About $80 million in food aid and $1 million in medical
aid were not affected by the decision.

   President Petar Mladenov appealed to all
parties Tuesday to leave their political differences behind, but
opposition leaders reaffirmed their refusal to join a government
with the former Communists.
   The former Communists, who now call themselves Socialists, on
Monday became the only ones in Eastern Europe to win free elections
after four decades of unchallenged rule.
   ``Those who seek to find winners and losers behind the figures
would make a mistake,'' Mladenov said, according to the state BTA
news agency. He said he would convene the new parliament within one
month but gave no date.
   Mladenov repeated his desire to see a ``competent'' government
supported by the entire country, BTA reported.
   But Petar Beron, a leading member of the main opposition
alliance, the Union of Democratic Forces (UDF), said the Socialists
should form a government alone.
   ``It's up to the Communists. They have the majority. So let them
form the government,'' Beron said.
   The Socialists won 211 of the Parliament's 400 seats in two
rounds of balloting, Bulgaria's first free elections in 58 years.
The UDF won 144 seats, or 47 percent of the vote, giving it
considerable sway in the legislature.
   Beron and other opposition leaders spoke to reporters during a
break in a UDF Coordinating Council session, held to discuss future
strategy in Parliament.
   While most UDF leaders seemed adamant in rejecting any kind of
cooperation with the Socialists, informed sources said that
behind-the-scenes contacts were imminent.
   Socialist leaders were said to have already approached the
Social Democrats, one of the strongest parties in the 16-member
alliance, for possible cooperation. However, this could not be
independently confirmed.
   Another UDF official suggested that after municipal elections,
scheduled for the fall, the opposition might consider a coalition
if the former Communists were knocked out of power at lower levels.
   But UDF spokesman Georgi Spasov appeared to rule out any
compromise.
   ``If somebody, as an individual, is invited by the Socialists,
no one will serve as a puppet in my opinion,'' he told reporters.
   A senior member of the independent trade union Podkrepa,
Lyubomir Pavlov, also ruled out opposition participation in a
government.
   ``They (the Socialists) would obstruct real economic reform'' in
a coalition cabinet, Pavlov said. ``They are not for radical
economic reform.''
   The Socialists have said they favor gradual transition to a
market economy, while opposing privatization of agriculture on a
large scale.
   The UDF, of which Podkrepa is a member, favors more radical
economic reforms including privatization.
   In an interview with The Associated Press on Monday, Premier
Andrei Lukanov said ``it is an illusion'' to believe that
privatization would essentially improve agricultural output.
   Pavlov said the possibility of a caretaker government could only
be considered in the event of a prolonged government crisis.
   Meanwhile, in a meeting with the press, Zhivko Stalev, head of
the Central Electoral Commission, said the panel had received a
series of complaints from the various parties competing in the
elections.
   Stalev noted that the majority of complaints concerned problems
with electoral lists, distribution of ballots on election day
outside the polling stations, the representation of political
parties in electoral commissions and inadmissible counting of
invalid votes and empty envelopes.
   Other complaints related to political agitation on election day,
the removal of ballots from voting booths and the sometimes
inadequate privacy of voters.
   Some foreign observers had pointed out that in some cases the
canvas of makeshift booths was transparent.
   Stalev said all complaints would be passed on to a commission to
be set up by the new Parliament for further action.

   Here is a look at the results of
multi-party elections held in Eastern European countries since
democratic reforms began sweeping the region last year:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   BULGARIA _ The Balkan country held its first free multi-party
elections in 58 years on June 10 and 17.
   The ruling Socialist Party, which until April was the Communist
Party, clinched an absolute majority with 211 of parliament's 400
seats.
   The main opposition Union of Democratic Forces, a 16-party
alliance, captured 144 seats. The Agrarian Party, a once docile
ally of the Communists, won 16 seats and the rest went to small
opposition groups and independents.
   Bulgaria is the first Eastern European nation to freely elect a
parliament dominated by the former Communist Party.
   Analysts say the Socialists won because of Bulgaria's deep
Communist tradition, which goes back nearly 100 years, and fears
that a rapid switch to private ownership, as advocated by the
opposition, would cost jobs.

center-right Hungarian Democratic Forum 165 of the 386 seats at
stake. The Socialist Party, created by reformist Communists last
October, won 8.55 percent of the seats.

   ROMANIA _ Free elections were held May 20, the first since 1937.
The National Salvation Front, which includes many ex-Communists,
won a landslide victory with 66.31 percent of the votes and
controls both chambers of the bicameral 387-seat Parliament.
   The traditional pre-World War II National Liberal Party and the
National Peasant Party received 6.41 percent and 2.56 percent of
the votes, respectively.

   SOVIET UNION _ In March of last year, Soviet citizens for the
first time were able to choose candidates in elections for a new
Congress of People's Deputies, electing even some dissidents.
   The Soviet Parliament legalized multiple political parties for
the entire country March 13.
   In February, in the Baltic republic of Lithuania, the Sajudis
People's Front won a two-thirds majority of deputies in the new
Parliament, thus becoming the Soviet Union's first freely elected,
non-Communist dominated, legislature. In March, the parliament
elected the first non-Communist president of a republic, Sajudis
leader Vytautus Landsbergis.
   Free elections were also held in the Baltic republics of Latvia
and Estonia.
   Boris Yeltsin, the populist rival of Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, on May 29 was elected president of Russia, the Soviet
Union's largest and most powerful republic.

   YUGOSLAVIA _ The first multi-party elections in Yugoslavia's
45-year Communist history were held in Slovenia on April 8 and in
Croatia on April 22 and May 6.
   In both, the ruling Communists were defeated by center-right
parties that emphasized the republics' interests over perservation
of Yugoslavia's fragile federation.
   Multi-party elections are planned in Yugoslavia's other
republics of Bosnia-Hercegovina, Macedonia and Montenegro later
this year. The ruling Communists in the largest state of Serbia
have so far rejected Western-style elections.
   Federal authorities have said elections for the national
parliament would be held in the fall. No date has been set.

   ALBANIA _ The last bastion of Stalinist rule has begun to talk
about cautious economic reforms, but still rejects the kind of
broad democratic changes embraced by other Eastern European
countries. The Communist leadership, which broke with Moscow in the
1960s, has made it clear it has no intention of relinquishing its
leading role or allowing free elections.

   An epidemic of dangerous pregnancies in which the
fetus develops outside the womb is afflicting expectant mothers,
many of whom have had a common and often symptom-free sexual
infection, researchers say.
   The number of such pregnancies _ called ectopic pregnancies _
increased fourfold from 1970 to 1985, hitting 78,400 women that
year, researchers reported in Wednesday's Journal of the American
Medical Association.
   A woman's risk of developing an ectopic pregnancy, which causes
11 percent of maternal deaths, more than doubles if she has had the
bacterial infection chlamydia trachomatis, the researchers said.
   They based their conclusion on tests of 306 women with ectopic
pregnancies and 266 women with normal pregnancies.
   Chlamydia is an epidemic in itself, infecting an estimated 4
million people a year, more than any other sexually transmitted
disease, according to the national Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta.
   An unlooked-for finding of the study was that women who douched
had almost as high a risk of developing ectopic pregnancies as
women who had a history of chlamydial infection, the researchers
said.
   The reasons are unclear, but the findings support previous
studies, said the researchers. They speculated that douching may
propel bacteria from the lower genital tract to the normally
sterile upper genital tract.
   When bacteria invade the upper genital tract, the resulting
infection can scar the Fallopian tubes, blocking the normal path
that eggs travel from the ovaries to the womb.
   That is what often happens in untreated chlamydial infections,
said Julius Schachter, a co-author of the study and a professor of
epidemiology and laboratory medicine at the University of
California, San Francisco.
   ``What is dangerous is that it (chlamydia) can cause an upper
genital tract infection without causing symptoms,'' Schachter said
in a telephone interview.
   ``The first time a woman finds out she's had it is when she has
a bad outcome ... either infertility or ectopic pregnancy.''
   In 97 percent of ectopic pregnancies, the fertilized egg lodges
in the Fallopian tubes, where as the fetus enlarges, it can rupture
the tubes or cause severe bleeding.
   Such pregnancies, though dangerous, can now be detected early
and ended surgically.
   ``You can't prevent this by treating a symptomatic woman because
she's never had symptoms,'' Schachter said. ``What we need is a
chlamydia control program to reduce infection and prevent
complications.''
   Such a program _ involving routine screening of sexually active
young people and treating those found to be infected _ already
exists for gonorrhea, Schachter said.
   That disease infects an estimated 1.5 million people a year and
is another major cause of ectopic pregnancy, says the CDC.
   Starting a control program for chlamydia would cost an estimated
$50 million, he said, citing a CDC figure.
   ``That would be highly cost-effective, because chlamydia costs
billions of dollars in complications,'' said Schachter, who has
previously reported that chlamydia infects up to one in 20 pregnant
women, 60 percent of whom pass it to their newborns, who may get
pneumonia or eye inflammation as a result.
   Schachter and his colleagues also recommended further research
into the practice of douching. Changes in douching habits, if they
reduced ectopic pregnancies, could have a quicker impact than a
chlamydia control program, they said.
   However, Dr. Bruce B. Dan of the American Medical Association
disagreed. He called for caution in blaming douching for ectopic
pregnancy and said physicians ``would do better by telling women at
every opportunity how to protect themselves from acquiring
chlamydial infections.
   ``This strategy would also serve to decrease the incidence of
gonorrhea, syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus infection (which
causes AIDS), and hepatitis B infection, something a change in
douching habits is unlikely to do,'' Dan added in an editorial
accompanying the study.
   A related study in Wednesday's Journal found that most of 323
pregnant women with chlamydial infections responded to antibiotic
treatment, and suffered significantly fewer pregnancy problems than
those who didn't respond to treatment.

<HEAD>Amidst Surge of Protests, African Leaders Gather for Summit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL DONNET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LA BAULE, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders from 33 African countries, many
facing growing opposition at home, gathered under tight security
Tuesday for a summit with French President Francois Mitterrand.
   Navy patrol boats, 12 companies of riot police and more than
1,500 regular police officers were deployed in and around this posh
beach resort as delegations arrived for the three-day summit.
   French officials said 22 delegations would be led by a head of
state, two by prime ministers and nine by lesser-ranking Cabinet
ministers.
   French-African summits have been held every two years since the
early 1960s. This year's gathering coincides with unprecedented
political turbulence in French-speaking Africa and unusually harsh
domestic criticism of France's policies in its former colonies.
   On Tuesday, prominent newspapers on the political right and left
said France had persisted too long in supporting corrupt,
repressive African governments.
   ``The French government speaks of democracy and continues to
support dictatorial, bloodstained regimes,'' said L'Humanite,
newspaper of France's Communist Party.
   Mitterrand, in an interview with the prominent daily Le Monde,
accused other Western countries of indifference toward Africa and
said France would never abandon the continent. French aid money was
subject to ``extremely rigorous'' review to ensure it was properly
spent, he said.
   There have been anti-government protests and demands for an end
to one-party rule in many African countries in recent months. In
several countries, leaders have pledged to allow political
pluralism.
   Two of French-speaking Africa's senior leaders _ Felix
Houphouet-Boigny of Ivory Coast and Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire _ are
not attending the summit. Both recently made concessions to
opposition groups by proposing multi-party systems. Mobutu has been
beset by calls for an international inquiry into an alleged
massacre of scores of university students by security forces.
   Mitterrand, during a visit last week to four Indian Ocean
nations that belong to the Organization of African Unity, said
France was committed to remaining a spokesman for underdeveloped
counties.
   ``There is no democracy without development,'' he said.
   During the summit, Ivory Coast, Gabon, Cameroon and Congo are
expected to receive new concessions from France regarding their
foreign debt. Because these countries are classified as
middle-income, they have not been helped by previous moves by
France and other Western countries to write off large portions of
foreign debt for several poor countries.
   After an opening banquet Tuesday night, the summit was to
continue with closed-door discussions Wednesday. The closing
ceremony Thursday is to be followed by a news conference featuring
Mitterrand, Morocco's King Hassan II, who was host of the previous
summit, and the leader of the African country chosen to be host of
the 1992 summit.
   Ten non-Francophone countries are attending the summit,
including first-time participants Mozambique and Namibia.
   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights
organization, issued documents this week alleging serious human
rights abuses in several participating countries _ Mauritania,
Cameroon, Chad, Congo, Ivory Coast, Morocco, Niger, Senegal and
Zaire.

   The importer of the ``Gut Buster'' exercise
device has agreed to pay a $130,000 fine to settle a lawsuit
charging it failed to report a product defect, the Consumer Product
Safety Commission said Tuesday.
   The commission alleged Consumer Direct, Inc. of Canton, Ohio
ignored consumer complaints claiming a defect in the ``Gut Buster''
caused its spring to break and created ``a substantial product
hazard'' which it was legally obligated to report.
   The agency said the company had received many complaints of
cuts, bruises and other injury caused by the breaks.
   Consumer Direct maintains that no substantial hazard existed and
that it did not violate statutory reporting requirements.
   However, the company agreed in November 1988 to a repair program
to retrofit 2 million ``Gut Busters'' with devices that would avoid
the spring breakages.
   The CPSC reminded consumers to discontinue use of the exercisers
until they have obtained the repair kit. Consumer Direct can be
reached at 1-800-325-7292.

<HEAD>Eastern States Told of Quake Threat to Bridges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY BAIR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bridge builders east of the Rockies must learn
the lessons of last year's deadly earthquake in California,
researchers said Tuesday.
   ``A major eastern earthquake will happen, it's just a question
of when,'' James Cooper, deputy chief structural engineer with the
Federal Highway Administration, told about 250 bridge architects
and state highway officials attending the International Bridge
Conference in Pittsburgh.
   Bridges are especially imperiled when built on soft soils and
underlying hard rock, a combination found in many Eastern cities.
Scientists say the condition amplifies tremors.
   ``An earthquake is like an explosion, sending energy in all
directions,'' U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Bob Hamilton said
in a telephone interview from Reston, Va. ``In the East, the energy
waves travel much further. The crust is older and cooler, less
broken up by mountain building.
   ``Out West, the mountain building is still going on. The crust
is busted up, reducing the amplitude of an earthquake.''
   Rocky ground covers most of the West. Exceptions are San
Francisco and Oakland, Calif., parts of which are built on soft
ground known as Bay Mud.
   The sections of the double-decker Interstate-880 in Oakland that
collapsed during the Oct. 17 earthquake was built on Bay Mud.
   Klaus Jacob, a Columbia University seismologist, noted that
other sections of the highway built on harder ground withstood the
quake. Jacob said I-880 was weakened by ``that extra Jell-O pudding
layer under the structure.''
   In the East, major underground faults lie in the central
Mississippi River valley, New England and South Carolina.
   The last major eastern quake, in 1895, was centered near the
junction of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers in Charleston, Mo. An
1886 earthquake near Charleston, S.C., leveled most of the city and
killed 20 people.
   Shock waves from an earthquake east of the Rockies would travel
30 to 40 times farther than waves from the same quake in
California, Jacob said. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates more
conservatively that such a quake would travel 20 times as far.
   For example, three thundering quakes in 1811-12 near the
frontier settlement of New Madrid, Mo., were felt 850 miles away in
Washington, D.C.
   ``We have the luxury in the East of having time between our
earthquakes,'' Jacob said. ``Another New Madrid earthquake may be
around the corner tomorrow. We should use the time we have to make
repairs.''
   After the 1971 San Fernando quake in California, the state spent
$54 million to tie together sections of 1,200 bridges with steel
cables.
   If a bridge isn't tied, ``when it starts doing that wave, it
will bounce off its supports,'' said James Roberts, chief bridge
engineer for the California Department of Transportation
   California engineers also are experimenting with collaring
bridge columns in steel, which could have saved I-880, said Ian
Buckle, deputy director of the National Center for Earthquake
Engineering Research in Buffalo, N.Y.
   Buckle said state transportation officials should consider both
methods when patching up aging bridges or building new ones.
   The Federal Highway Adminstration, in its 1989 report to
Congress, said 41.3 percent of the nation's 577,710 bridges were
either structurally deficient or functionally obsolete.

   A man hijacked a Soviet airliner with
60 people aboard Tuesday and then surrendered to Finnish
authorities and sought political asylum. He asked to be taken to
the United States, the interior minister said.
   It was the third hijacking of a Soviet passenger plane in less
than two weeks.
   The 55 passengers and five crew members safely left the
aircraft, which was parked beside a runway at Helsinki airport and
surrounded by police. The hijacker gave up an hour later after
talks with Finnish officials through a cabin door of the twin-jet
Aeroflot Tupolev 134.
   The passengers, all Soviets, were flown to the Soviet city of
Murmansk later Tuesday.
   The Soviet deputy aviation minister, Mikhail Timofeev,
identified the hijacker as Oleg Kozlov. Timofeev said the man
threatened to blow up the plane. He said a fake hand grenade was
seized.
   Finnish Interior Minister Jarmo Rantanen said no explosives were
found on the plane but that the 20-year-old hijacker ``had a
bomb-like object under his jacket.''
   ``His real aim was apparently the United States,'' Rantanen told
a news conference. ``He wants out. He wants to go to the U.S.A.''
   The hijacker requested asylum, but processing the request could
take weeks, Rantanen said.
   A 1974 Soviet-Finnish agreement aimed at preventing hijackings
says the suspect must be returned to the Soviet Union at Moscow's
request. Some observers said, however, that Kozlov's request for
asylum could be granted or he could face trial in Finland.
   The plane was en route from the Latvian capital of Riga to
Murmansk on the northern Kola peninsula when it was hijacked, said
Irmeli Paavola of the Finnish Aviation Authority.
   ``Nothing terrible happened in the aircraft,'' one passenger
identified only as Anatoli told Finnish TV. ``The crew announced
that the plane had been commanded to divert its route. They said we
are flying abroad.''
   Finnish Radio said two Finnish fighter jets escorted the Soviet
airliner to Helsinki as a precaution.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said a Civil Aviation Ministry
commission would investigate the hijacking, the third since June 9.
   On Monday, a 29-year-old pilot, Valeri Yuricevic, commandeered a
12-seat Antonov-2 aircraft in Izmail, near the Ukrainian port of
Odessa, and flew to Turkey, where he asked for asylum. There was no
one else on board.
   Ihsan Dede, governor of the province of Kocaeli, where Yuricevic
landed, said the pilot told authorities he wanted to escape ``the
undemocratic regime and harsh life conditions'' in the Soviet Union.
   On June 9, Dimitry Semionov, a 17-year-old Soviet youth, used a
fake hand grenade to hijack a plane carrying 121 passengers during
a flight from Minsk to Murmansk.
   The plane was forced to fly to Stockholm, where Semionov
surrendered. He said later through a lawyer that he had acted on
impulse after a family quarrel and wanted to go to a ``free
country.''
   Semionov was arraigned in a Stockholm court and could face up to
four years in prison, depending on results of psychiatric tests.

<HEAD>Pentagon Revises Report on `Friendly Fire' Deaths</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon revised its figures Tuesday on
the number of soldiers accidentally wounded by their comrades in
the Panama invasion, saying 16 of 310 servicemen wounded in action
were hit by ``friendly fire.''
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams also raised the possibility
that another 21 U.S. servicemen might have been wounded by an U.S.
Air Force AC-130 gunship, and that if the incident occurred, it may
have been captured on the plane's video camera.
   Williams said it is presently ``impossible to distinguish''
whether the 21 were injured by the gunship or from mortar fire of
Panamanian Defense Forces during the Dec. 20 military operation.
   He said he'd asked for a review of the video to check whether
the incident might be on tape.
   In his statement, Williams said the Pentagon stood by its
initial count that two _ and perhaps three _ U.S. servicemen had
been killed by friendly fire. The third case was still under study,
Williams said.
   The Pentagon has refused to identify which of the 23 servicemen
killed in Panama died under such circumstances.
   On Monday, the department had said 19 of some 324 soldiers
wounded in action had been hit accidentally by their comrades. The
figures issued Tuesday changed both the number hit by friendly fire
and the total number of wounded.
   Williams said the department had refined the figures in an
overnight study of the death reports.
   The review was prompted by a Newsweek magazine report that nine
U.S. soldiers had been killed by their comrades and that more than
60 percent of the woundings had been caused by friendly fire.
   Williams also disputed the article's contention that there were
more than a dozen ``leaks'' about the military operation.
   ``I know of no so-called leaks,'' Williams said, adding that
there is ``No evidence that information was in the hands of the
PDF.'' The spokesman noted that with the massive movement of U.S.
troops that got under way prior to the invasion, there was much
speculation about the event but that it was not compromised.
   In his first comment on the issue, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
lamented the deaths by friendly fire, saying such things occur in
complex, night-time military operations where high-tech weaponry is
used.
   ``I wish it had not happened. On the other hand I don't think it
detracts from the overall quality of the operation,'' he told
reporters after a Pentagon briefing on the budget.
   Williams, in his briefing, said that of the 23 killed in action,
two Rangers were killed by friendly fire at Rio Hato ``during an
intense fire fight with the PDF (Panamanian Defense Force) near
dawn.''
   ``Of the 310 wounded in action, it now appears that 16 were
wounded by friendly fire in several isolated incidents throughout
Panama,'' Williams said.
   ``Yesterday's report of 19 wounded in action included some
accidental injuries that we have now determined were not caused by
hostile fire,'' the spokesman said, adding that since the cases
were being looked at very closely, the numbers could change again.
   Williams said the Pentagon has looked into every case and deeply
regrets any loss of life, for whatever reason.
   ``Nothing can diminish the sacrifices that all these men made to
their country. Casualties caused by friendly fire are an
unfortunate circumstance of war,'' he said.
   The report in the June 25 Newsweek issue quoted unidentified
military officials as the source of its information.
   Williams said confusion over the deaths could have arisen
because Noriega's troops used U.S.-supplied bullets and weapons.

<TEXT>
   Rival Christian forces fought with
howitzers and mortars across the Christian enclave Tuesday in a
confrontation that killed four people and was the most serious
violation of month-old cease-fire.
   Police said six people were injured in the battles, which began
at 9:45 a.m. and subsided five hours later. A French government
envoy, Francois Scheer, met in west Beirut with President Elias
Hrawi in an effort to salvage a Vatican plan for ending the
Christian warfare.
   The new casualties raised the overall toll to 1,040 killed and
2,780 wounded since the battle for control of the Christian enclave
erupted Jan. 30. The fighting is between troops of Gen. Michel Aoun
and militiamen of Samir Geagea's Lebanese Forces. A cease-fire was
declared May 17.
   The latest battles covered most of the 310-square-mile Christian
enclave. The streets of east Beirut and the surrounding hinterland
were deserted as people huddled in basements and bomb shelters.
   A police spokesman said it could not be determined who started
the clashes but noted that tension had been mounting since Monday,
when Lebanon's president rejected a Vatican proposal for a
permanent settlement to the conflict.
   The Vatican has suggested reconsideration of an accord designed
to end Lebanon's 15-year-old civil war. It was that accord,
supported by the Arab League, that led to Hrawi's election as
president.
   In return for reconsidering the accord, Aoun would agree to
recognize Hrawi's government, the Vatican suggested.
   Prime Minister Salim Hoss and Parliament speaker Hussein
Husseini backed Hrawi in his opposition to the idea.
   ``The French government is helping Lebanon to overcome the
difficulties it is facing,'' Scheer told reporters after the
90-minute meeting with Hrawi. ``The dialogue, led by France, could
help support the mechanism of the Taif accord,'' Scheer added,
referring to the Saudi Arabian city in which the accord was reached.
   Scheer said he also planned to meet the Vatican ambassador while
in Lebanon. The ambassador, Papal Nuncio Pablo Puente, met Tuesday
with Aoun at the general's headquarters outside Beirut. ``We are
seeking peace, through peace,'' Puente told reporters after the
meeting.
   France and the Vatican have been the Christians' main backers
since Lebanon's independence from France in 1943. Neighboring Syria
backs the Moslems.
   The conservative newspaper Ad-Diyar reported Tuesday that Scheer
was promoting a five-point compromise plan that called for
recognition of the Hrawi government by all the warring factions, in
addition to recognizing the Taif accord as ``a frame for a national
settlement.''
   The compromise also called for the formation of an expanded
``national government respresenting all the factions.'' This echoed
the Vatican's suggestion that Aoun be given a government portfolio.
   The French proposal, according to the report, said the Taif
accord should be debated in Parliament and the decision on passing
or rejecting it ``should be left to the house.''
   It called for parliamentary elections ``as soon as possible,''
the newspaper added.
   Aoun has rejected the Taif agreement because it does not include
a deadline for the withdrawal of Syrian soldiers from Lebanon.
Syria has about 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976 mandate to
quell civil war fighting, but Aoun maintains they violated that
mandate by siding with the Moslems in the war.

<HEAD>Government Calls For Talks But Arrests Two Opposition Leaders</HEAD>

   The government appealed for talks with
the opposition Tuesday but also pressed its crackdown on dissent by
arresting two prominent critics of President-elect Ion Iliescu.
   The wife of an Iliescu opponent detained earlier on charges of
involvement in last week's anti-government violence took refuge at
the Dutch ambassador's residence.
   There was no sign of organized protest at University Square,
where demonstrators gathered Sunday and Monday in defiance of the
violent suppression of dissent.
   Riot police June 13 brutally broke up a 53-day anti-Iliescu
demonstration on the square, and rioters later attacked government
buildings with firebombs.
   Thousands of coal miners summoned by Iliescu to help keep order
then poured into the capital from around the nation and roamed the
streets for two days, clubbing anyone they considered opponents of
the president. They left Friday, also at Iliescu's behest.
   Authorities appeared to be adopting a strategy of talking to
opposition groups while detaining their leaders and sanctioning
police action against any further illegal demonstrations.
   A communique carried by the state Rompres news agency said
Interior Minister Doru Viorel Ursu and the Romanian Information
Service had invited student organizations and intellectuals to
discuss ``problems of common interest.''
   The Information Service is the intelligence agency that replaced
the feared secret police of Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu,
who was toppled and executed in the December revolution.
   It was unclear whether demonstrators stayed away from the square
because of the talks. At the University of Bucharest, students of
several departments began or planned strikes.
   Government opponents seek the ouster of Iliescu and other former
Communists who hold top posts in the governing National Salvation
Front. It took power during the revolution and won parliamentary
elections by a landslide last month.
   Iliescu was to be inaugurated Wednesday, and U.S. Embassy
spokesman Virgil Bodeen said no American representative would
attend because of U.S. displeasure over how his government has
dealth with the unrest.
   Parliament's lower house voted Monday to give police and
soldiers the authority to clear protesters from University Square
and urged police to take ``immediate action'' against unauthorized
protests.
   The Interior Ministry identified the opposition figures arrested
Tuesday as Dumitru Dinca and Nica Leon, leader of the small
National Democratic Party.
   It said Dinca was charged with ``larceny and instigation toward
committing major crimes,'' while Leon was accused of ``destruction
of public property.''
   The two were being held as part of an investigation into the
53-day anti-government protest and subsequent unrest, the
government said.
   On Monday, authorities detained Marian Munteanu, a student
leader severely beaten by miners. He was moved from his hospital
bed to an unidentified Interior Ministry hospital on charges of
instigating violence.
   Dutch Ambassador Coen F. Stork said he offered haven to
Munteanu's wife, Claudia, after ``she said that she was very scared
to move about ... after what happened to her husband.''
   Stork said Mrs. Munteanu would likely leave his home soon.
   ``She has not asked for asylum, she is just my guest,'' said the
diplomat, a key Western critic of Romania's human rights record
under Ceausescu.
   The government reacted sharply to the development.
   Munteanu ``is not a political prisoner but a criminal,'' it said
in a statement. ``We have nothing against his wife, and we are
astounded that she chose the Dutch Embassy asking for refuge.''
   The Interior Ministry suggested most of the 1,021 people
detained last week had been set free. It said in a statement that
69 had been charged with major crimes and 182 with petty crimes.
   State television said the violence last week caused $7.5 million
in damage.
   Foreign governments, including the United States, have condemned
the way Romania has handled protests, and numerous countries have
suspended all but humanitarian aid.
   Stork warned against drawing parallels between the Iliescu
government's behavior and the brutal suppression of dissent under
Ceausescu.
   ``There's a little flurry of human rights cases now,'' he said.
``It's not to be confused with the previous period. In those days
people didn't dare to ask for help from Western embassies.''
   The opposition Romania Libera daily published Tuesday for the
first time since miners shut the paper down Thursday, but copies of
the 800,000-circulation daily were difficult to find.
   Editor Mihai Creanga suggested there were some hitches in
publishing but refused to elaborate.
   In an editorial, the paper indirectly criticized the
anti-government rioting and Iliescu's use of miners to crush the
opposition.
   ``In a democratic state there is no room for instigation to
violence, because, as we know, violence breeds violence,'' the
daily said.
   In Paris, the International Federation of Newspaper Publishers
protested Tuesday to Iliescu over attacks on members of the staff
and offices of the newspaper.

<TEXT>
   A woman who ran a boardinghouse was
ordered Tuesday to stand trial on nine murder counts for allegedly
poisoning her mostly elderly tenants to get their pension and
disability benefits.
   Dorothea Puente, 61, was ordered to be arraigned July 10 in
Sacramento County Superior Court. The order by County Municipal
Court Judge Gail Ohanesian culminated a five week preliminary
hearing.
   ``I do find that there is ample circumstantial evidence ... that
death was by criminal means,'' the judge said, adding that there
was sufficient evidence that Puente ``had the opportunity to kill
for financial gain.''
   Puente, who has displayed little emotion throughout her hearing,
sat quietly at the defense table.
   Puente was orderd to stand trial on all the counts with which
she had been charged. She could face the death penalty if convicted.
   Prosecutors said her murder trial could last at least six months.
   She has pleaded innocent, and defense attorneys insisted she
would be aquitted.
   ``There is totally insufficient evidence to convict her or
anybody else based on the quality of evidence that has been
presented in court in this case,'' Assistant Public Defender Kevin
Clymo said.
   Puente was arrested after a social worker complained that one of
her clients _ a roomer in Puente's downtown home _ had disappeared.
In November 1988, authorities dug up seven bodies from the grounds
of the Victorian-style dwelling.
   She was later implicated in two other deaths _ that of a woman
who died of a drug overdose at Puente's house, and that of a man
whose body was found in a wooden box in a neighboring county.
   Prosecutors said Puente has a record of administering stupefying
drugs to intended robbery victims. They contend the matronly
ex-convict killed her victims for their Social Security and
government benefit checks.
   Defense attorneys said the alleged victims, ranging from age 52
to 80 and mostly poor and alcoholic, died either by suicide or
natural causes. Among their ailments were a brain tumor, lung
disease, heart disease and diabetes.
   The preliminary hearing featured 17 days of testimony by nearly
80 witnesses and more than 100 exhibits. Much of the testimony
focused on the causes of death.
   In only one death, the first one, was a cause ever listed. Ruth
Munroe, 61, died April 28, 1982, from an overdose of codeine and
Tylenol. That death was considered to be either accidental or a
suicide until investigators began digging up bodies from the yard.
   A prescription tranquilizer flurazepam, or Dalmane, was detected
in all seven bodies that had been buried in shallow graves on the
boardinghouse grounds.
   The medication's role, if any, in the deaths is unclear. The
bodies, buried anywhere from weeks to years, were too decomposed
for autopsies to determine the cause of deaths.
   A total of nine other drugs were found in the boardinghouse
bodies. All seven people had been Puente's tenants, and their
doctors and fellow boarders have testified that most of them were
heavy drinkers.
   The ninth murder charge was filed in connection with the death
of Everson Theodore Gillmouth, a 77-year-old Oregon man who was
Puente's fiance and roommate when he died. His body was found by
fishermen on New Year's Day 1986 in a wooden box on a bank of the
Sacramento River in Sutter County.

   Heavy thunderstorms and tornadoes crimped cleanup efforts on
Tuesday by Iowa and South Dakota residents who are still reeling
from weekend weather, and Nebraska reported its first fatality from
recent floods.
   After morning rains added 1 to 2 inches to watersheds of flooded
rivers, Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad added 11 counties to 22 already
declared disaster areas. That brings the total to one-third of the
state's 99 counties.
   The National Weather Service said no appreciable additional
flooding was expected. Three deaths in Iowa have been blamed on the
most recent storms.
   Police in Des Moines asked employers to send workers home early
because storm sewers had backed up, clogging major streets leading
out of downtown.
   In the central Iowa town of Jewell, about 55 miles north of Des
Moines, a tornado struck the center building at South Hamilton High
School, where maintenance worker Don Strangeland recounted the
damage: ``I heard the roof just peeling off the school.''
   Just a little north of there in Webster City, another tornado
destroyed outbuildings and killed about 30 hogs on a 700-acre farm.
   ``Two months ago, we were concerned about the drought and now
here we are faced with major flooding,'' the governor said.
   Branstad said agricultural damage could be severe unless flood
waters recede soon. ``There's a considerable amount that's been
flooded, and it's getting very late as far as replanting,'' he said.
   Thunderstorms on Monday night also carried heavy rain across the
central and eastern part of South Dakota, where residents were
still cleaning up from Saturday night's violent weather.
   Cleanup efforts continued in the southeastern South Dakota towns
of Beresford and Alcester where a tornado swept through the area
causing more than $1 million in damage to 24 farms.
   In Alcester, neighbors spent Sunday and Monday helping each
other out, Police Chief Kevin Booker said. Residents with pickups
helped haul away trees that blocked up to one-third of the streets
in town.
   In the country, neighbors helped remove debris so farmers could
get back to their fields to replant crops torn up from the tornado
and high winds.
   A 77-year-old West Point, Neb., man was found drowned,
apparently the first person to die in flood waters that have
plagued northeast Nebraska for nearly a week. A relative found the
body 1{ blocks from the man's home, two miles south of West Point
near the Elkhorn River, said Cuming County Sheriff Larry Thiem.
   More storms ravaged south-central and northeastern Nebraska on
Monday night, causing authorities to ask residents of King Lake in
northern Douglas County to evacuate as the Elkhorn River reached
flood stage.
   Floods also struck further east.
   In Pennsylvania, thunderstorms moved throughout the state
saturating farmland, flooding basements and causing scattered power
outages, authorities said. No injuries were reported.
   The heaviest thunderstorms were reported in Rosencrans, Clinton
County, and Ohiopyle, Fayette County, the weather service said.
   About 200 McKean County residents were without power in several
small afternoon outages caused by lightning and downed power lines,
said Bill Manning, a foreman for Pennsylvania Electric Co.
   And in eastern Ohio, recovery efforts continued in the Ohio
River town of Shadyside, where flash floods last week killed 21
people.

   A town's ordinance requiring residents
to obtain permits before installing political signs in their yards
is unconstitutional, a Superior Court judge ruled Tuesday.
   Judge Melanie Famiglietti threw out the conviction of James
Lemoi, who had been found guilty of erecting signs in his yard in
1984 and 1985 without a permit.
   Lemoi, 70, had been convicted in District Court of violating
Barrington's ordinance and was fined $13,000. He challenged his
conviction and the American Civil Liberties Union picked up his
case.
   Barrington allows a variety of signs to be installed without a
permit to advertise a house for sale, a professional business such
as a law firm in a home or signs tied to seasonal decorations.
Other signs require a permit before they are erected.
   Lemoi installed signs in his yard twice. The first was an appeal
to the public for help after his wife's death and a fire at his
house, the judge said.
   The second, Famiglietti said, was a political statement about
town officials.
   Under the Barrington ordinance, Lemoi should have obtained a
permit both times.
   But the judge ruled that the town cannot regulate signs by their
content.
   ``If these very same signs indicated a doctor's office in
(Lemoi's) home or were a theater marquee or were holiday
decorations Mr. Lemoi would not be in court today and would not be
fined $13,000,'' the judge said.
   In December 1984, Lemoi's wife died and just a few days later
his house caught fire, causing extensive damage. He wasn't home at
the time and was unhurt.
   About 10 days after the fire, Lemoi put a sign up in his yard
asking for help. Seven months later, after he was unable to obtain
police or fire department reports about the fire investigation, he
erected another sign, stating simply: ``Come Clean.''
   It was after that sign that Barrington charged him in District
Court.
   Lemoi described Famiglietti's decision as ``swell.''
   He said he pursued the case for so long because he believed
Barrington was wrong.
   ``I don't know why they treated me this way,'' he said. ``I was
born and brought up in this town.''
   ACLU lawyer Elizabeth Colt, who represented Lemoi, said
Famiglietti's decision came down squarely on the side of free
speech guaranteed by the Constitution.
   ``You can't distinguish among signs,'' Ms. Colt said, citing the
prohibition on political signs. ``It's (sign regulations) got to be
content neutral.''
   A lawyer for the town, Michael Mosco, said he would leave a
decision whether to appeal the ruling to the town council, but he
defended ordinance, saying it was reasonable.

   Yapping at the heels of the 1990
national census, here comes ... the 1990 Marquette pet census.
   For the first time since 1959, this city on Michigan's Upper
Peninsula will attempt to count its dogs and cats. All of them.
   Michigan Youth Corps workers are starting to canvass the city
this week, seeking information on pets from the city's 8,600
households, animal control officer Paula Maslanka said. The effort
is expected to take seven weeks.
   ``The main objective is to find out where the animals live and
get them on file, so when strays come in we can find out who the
owner is,'' Maslanka said. ``A lot of people, especially those who
have cats, don't realize their animal has been picked up for
several days, and I end up keeping them for only so long and I have
to put them down.''
   Maslanka said she also hopes the census reminds owners to get
their pets licensed. She said she has licensed only nine cats in
the past few years, even though city ordinance requires all cats to
be registered. The same ordinance limits pet owners to three dogs
or cats to a house.
   Maslanka said city records show there was a pet census by police
in 1959, but there are no records of its result.

   Sayde Tisch Busch, matriarch of the Tisch family
and mother to the heads of CBS Inc. and Loews Corp., has died. She
was 91.
   Mrs. Tisch Busch died Monday at Victoria Hospital, where she had
been a patient for 10 days, said her daughter-in-law, Wilma Tisch.
She had resided in Bal Harbour since 1960. She was buried Tuesday.
   Mrs. Tisch Busch was the mother of Laurence A. Tisch, president
and chief executive officer of CBS Inc., and chairman and co-chief
executive officer (with his brother), of Loews Corp.
   Preston Robert Tisch is president and co-chief executive officer
of Loews Corp. and a former U.S. postmaster general.
   Sayde Brenner married Al Tisch, a clothing manufacturer in New
York City, in 1920. They later bought two boys' camps in
Blairstown, N.J., which she directed for 11 years.
   The family bought their first hotel, in Lakewood, N.J., in 1946.
In 1950, they bought the first of several Atlantic City, N.J.,
hotels, the Traymore.
   By the mid-1950s, they operated 12 East Coast hotels. As the
family company grew, it acquired stock in Loews Theaters Inc., as
well as interests in, for example, tobacco and watches.
   Al Tisch died in 1960. His widow married S. Harry Busch of
Knoxville, Tenn., in 1969.
   Mrs. Tisch Busch is survived by her second husband, her two
sons, seven grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.

<HEAD>House Will Vote on Balanced Budget Amendment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conservative supporters of a proposed
constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget succeeded
Tuesday in their long-running quest to bring the issue to the full
House for a vote.
   Using a rarely-successful procedure, supporters of the proposal
overcame opposition by the House's Democratic leadership and are
now guaranteed a vote no later than next month.
   ``They can't prevent this now,'' said Rep. Larry Craig, R-Idaho,
one of the measure's sponsors.
   Supporters have long argued that an amendment requiring a
balanced budget is the only way to eliminate the huge deficits of
recent years, which have been stuck in the $150 billion range.
   Opponents argue that such an amendment would not work because
the real problem is the political stalemate over tax increases and
spending cuts that might eliminate the budget gap.
   For years, Democratic leaders have blocked balanced budget
amendments from moving out of the House Judiciary Committee.
   But under House procedures, a measure can be taken away from a
committee and brought to the full chamber for a vote if a majority
of the 435 members sign a so-called discharge petition.
   Craig and his allies announced Tuesday that they had collected
their 218th signature, the number needed.
   The drive to round up those signatures recently had taken a
controversial turn.
   One supporter had threatened to release the names of co-sponsors
of the balanced-budget amendment who had refused to sign the
petition. But the supporter, Rep. Chuck Douglas, R-N.H., said the
matter was now moot.
   Constitutional amendments must be approved by two-thirds votes
of the House and Senate, and then ratified by at least
three-fourths of the states.
   It is rare for discharge petitions to succeed.
   Since the House's current procedure was adopted in 1931, 482
such petitions have been filed, according to Richard Beth of the
Congressional Research Service, the research arm of Congress.
   Just 43 of the petitions _ including Tuesday's _ have succeeded
in collecting enough signatures to force a House vote. The last
time one was successful was in 1986, when a vote was forced on a
measure easing gun control laws.

   Soviet troops sent into two prisons to quell mass
rioting opened fire on escaping inmates, killing one and wounding
another, the official news agency Tass reported Tuesday.
   The inmates were shot in a prison in the Ukrainian city of
Dnepropertrovsk where 2,000 inmates went on a rampage Thursday and
seized hostages, Tass said.
   The hostages were released Friday.
   Tass said several inmates died after taking drugs stolen from
the prison pharmacy.
   The news agency initially reported two prisoners were killed by
gunfire from security forces, but later said troops opened fire on
two escaping prisoners, killing one and wounding another.
   The inmates were demanding better conditions and the relaxing of
prison regulations, the news agency said.
   Soviet television on Monday night showed Interior Ministry
troops and police, many wearing helmets and bullet-proof vests,
sealing off the prison.
   Troops were also deployed to control rioting at a jail in
Chelyabinsk, in the Ural mountains.
   On Sunday, 1,000 rioting prisoners rushed into the jail yard and
tried to escape by ramming the gate with a front loader.
   Tass reported the troops returned to their barracks Tuesday and
that the situation in the prison had returned to normal.

<HEAD>Mayors Bemoan Their Loss Of Clout; City Machines Rule No More</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, a veteran of Chicago's
tough ward politics, was reminiscing about the old days _ when he
checked in with City Hall before voting in Congress.
   ``All of us in Congress now are independent contractors,''
Rostenkowski told the nation's mayors in explaining why cities have
a hard time making their case these days.
   The mayors know that all too well.
   During their summer meeting this week, the more than 200 mayors,
Democrats and Republicans, from big cities and small, have been
virtually unanimous in saying cities have lost much of their clout
in Washington.
   But they are deeply divided over how to get it back. Some
advocate a militant approach in which mayors use their local
organizations against members of Congress who fail to help their
cities. Others say the mayors are to blame for their own decline
and must put their own houses in order.
   Their frustration has spilled over repeatedly these past few
days.
   They talk of losing billions when President Reagan cut domestic
programs to fund his military buildup. When they try to get some of
that back now, they're told the money is needed to reduce the
federal deficit. Yet the government quickly finds $300 billion to
bail out the savings and loan industry.
   The S&amp;L crisis, New York Mayor David Dinkins said Tuesday, ``has
shown us that federal money abounds.''
   The diversity of the mayors, a strength at times, can also prove
to be a weakness. At times the cities are forced to compete with
each other for the declining share of federal aid.
   ``It is hard for us at times to speak with one voice,'' said
Mayor Sharpe James of Newark, N.J. ``But the bigger problem is that
mayors have allowed the Congress to become fat cats, smug, secure,
assured of their positions. They're not fighting the real fights
anymore.''
   James believes mayors could win back some clout ``by holding
some congressmen hostage'' when elections roll around. ``Mayors and
congressman have had a honeymoon for far too long.''
   Many big city Democratic mayors are apoplectic in trying to
explain their setbacks in Washington, where Democrats control the
Congress.
   Two of those mayors, Boston's Raymond Flynn and New York's
Dinkins, said the mayors need to rally more grassroots support for
their causes. They have adopted the multibillion dollar S&amp;L bailout
plan as the centerpiece of their populist pitch.
   ``We, the mayors of urban America, must send a message to
Washington that only after we have housed our people, only after we
have educated our young people, only after we have repaired our
roads, and only after we heal our sick can we commit to the
extravagant bailout of a corrupt system,'' Dinkins said.
   Some mayors speak fondly of the urban heydays, when a Mayor
Daley of Chicago, Curley of Boston or LaGuardia of New York could
strike fear in Congress and at times even the White House.
   Now, Flynn said, cash-rich special interests have taken the
clout once wielded by city political machines.
   ``We've got to go to the people to get it back'' he said.
   Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley, the son of the late Mayor
Richard J. Daley, voiced the frustration of many of his colleagues
in saying too few members of Congress are in touch with residents
of their cities.
   ``It's another world,'' he said of Washington.
   But Milwaukee Mayor John Norquist said the mayors should accept
much of the blame for their declining clout.
   ``We should have a concise, constant message,'' he said in an
interview. ``We need to be more aggressive as an organization.''
   When they do speak as one, the mayors too often appear to be
whining, Norquist said.
   ``The message certainly needs to be more positive,'' he said.
``Pity doesn't get you much. Pity usually leads to contempt.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York's David Dinkins led fellow mayors
Tuesday in a populist appeal for a piece of the peace dividend
despite a warning from Congress that cities likely would not share
in any defense savings.
   ``We are obliged by the needs of the people we represent _ the
majority of Americans _ to put our claim on the liberated resources
of the Cold War,'' Dinkins told the U.S. Conference of Mayors.
``The money that had once financed armament factories can now help
rebuild our cities.''
   Dinkins spent only the morning at the conference because of his
role in planning for South African anti-apartheid leader Nelson
Mandela's visit to New York on Wednesday.
   But his speech was full of rhetoric welcomed by the mayors a day
after House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski told
the mayors they stood little chance of winning more federal aid
soon.
   Dinkins made no mention of Rostenkowski. Instead, he listed a
series of urban problems that he said threatened safety and the
social fabric of urban America.
   ``We do not seek every penny of the peace dividend, only a fair
share for the people of our cities, a fair share that has often
been denied,'' Dinkins told the mayors. ``It is a challenge that we
_ the mayors of America _ must mobilize to meet.''
   In a brief meeting with reporters after the speech, Dinkins said
it was up to mayors to lobby Rostenkowki and others in Congress.
   Dinkins called on fellow mayors to meet with him at an urban
summit in New York in October, and urged them to bring along local
business leaders to draft a strategy for winning more federal aid.
   His address was the highlight of a day that had the mayors
attending a variety of workshops and visiting an economic
enterprise zone in their host city.
   The meeting concludes Wednesday after the mayors formally
endorse a broad new domestic lobbying agenda that calls for major
federal funding increases for housing, education, anti-drug,
anti-poverty and other urban programs.
   The success of the plan hinges heavily on whether the mayors can
win their uphill fight for more federal aid.

<HEAD>Case of Missing Peasants Still Unsolved</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The case of seven Chinese peasants who
disappeared from a New York airport nearly two months ago remains a
mystery, authorities said Tuesday.
   Work continues on the Massachusetts farm that was the peasants'
destination as the group's nine remaining members prepare to
harvest their first crop, an organizer said.
   ``We just try to keep things going; nothing too exciting,'' said
Michael Ming Cui, who is helping Athol resident Molly Aitken run
the training program for Chinese peasants.
   The group of farmers from China's Fujian Province arrived at New
York's John F. Kennedy Airport on April 25. They were on their way
to participate in an effort to build a model Third World village
during an 11-month stay in Athol, a rural town about 50 miles north
of Springfield.
   At the airport, three other Chinese men hustled the seven into a
waiting car, Mrs. Aitken said.
   New York Port Authority police investigated the reported
abduction, tracing leads to the New Jersey apartment of a man who
rented the car.
   But there has been no trace of the farmers.
   The last report of the missing farmers was a letter Mrs. Aitken
received in May that said they had only planned to slip away with
friends to see more of New York City and were too embarrassed to
reappear following the hue and cry.
   The letter, postmarked New York City, said the men felt they had
lost face, and were afraid to return for fear they'd be deported.
   The port authority has said they are interested only in seeing
that the men are safe. Officials with the Chinese Consulate in New
York have also indicated they would urge the missing farmers to go
to Athol and take up their studies.
   Port Authority spokeswoman Lynn Tierney said Tuesday she did not
know of any developments in the case. ``We're keeping it open.
We're investigating and following any leads that come in, but there
hasn't been much activity lately.''
   Cui said he has heard that the farmers contacted their families
in China by telephone around the time of the letter.
   ``They told their families `Don't worry,' or something like
that,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, the project continues, although not without a few
hitches, Cui said.
   The village being built by the peasants from scratch is to be a
model for other governments of poor countries of what can be done.
   Mrs. Aitken is president of World Energy Foundation, whose aim
is transferring solar-power and similar technology to Third World
countries.
   Work on the village has been held up by a problem getting
building permits, Cui said.
   But the farmers have harvested their first crop of lettuce and
strawberries last week, and plan to donate the surplus to a food
bank in nearby Fitchburg, Cui said.
   ``We got some production,'' he said. ``At least they learned
something,'' he said.

   Jack Studdard, a veteran adjuster with
the insurance subsidiary of General Motors Acceptance Corp., went
to work Tuesday, a day after a gunman walked in and massacred eight
people.
   ``He thought he'd be better just to go on,'' said his wife,
Carol.
   He went even though the office is closed for the week and he had
been talking with Denise Highfill and Lee Simonton, two of the
victims.
   Simonton, a 33-year-old father of two young children, and Mrs.
Highfill, 36, died during the two-minute rampage that ended when
the gunman, James Edward Pough, fatally shot himself.
   Simonton, a deacon in the Baptist church, crawled underneath a
desk when the gunfire began. Mrs. Highfill was leaving her desk
when she was struck down by bullets from Pough's .30-caliber
semiautomatic rifle.
   ``He (Simonton) was a real good solid person, a man loved by
everyone who knew him,'' said Rev. Douglas Pigg, who will officiate
at Simonton's funeral Thursday. ``He was the quiet sort, who did
his job.''
   Pigg said he planned to use Simonton's personal Bible given to
him as a gift from his wife in 1980 to prepare for the funeral
service.
   Another victim, Cynthia Perry, 30, had just spent Sunday with
her parents to celebrate Fathers' Day.
   ``I feel depressed. I feel cheated,'' said Gail Perry, her
mother. ``She was a joy to everyone.''
   Jan David, a 40-year-old mother of two boys, was the last victim
killed during the massacre, her husband's law partner said Tuesday.
   ``She worked hard and took care of her family,'' said Jefferson
W. Morrow. ``She liked to be with her kids. Get out and fish.''
   GMAC President William Lovejoy led a team of officials from
Detroit to Jacksonville to counsel victims and their families and
set up an office to handle the company's business, spokesman John
Andrews said.
   The company employs 85 people at its suburban office it moved
into in 1977.
   Another victim, Drew Woods, was remembered by a neighbor as a
quiet, private person who enjoyed neighborhood children.
   ``He played catch with the kids, played ball with them,'' said
Kathy Brauner.
   Woods, 38, is survived by his wife, Davita.
   Two other GMAC employees _ Barbara Duckwall Holland and Sharon
Louise Hall, both 45, also died in the shooting along with Julia
White Burgess, 42, of Keystone Heights who had come to the office
to make a car payment.

   The House Judiciary Committee voted narrowly
Tuesday to send a constitutional amendment protecting the flag to
the House floor for a vote, as an Associated Press survey showed
the measure short of the support needed to pass Congress.
   The 19-17 committee vote set the stage for a showdown in the
House, possibly as early as this week.
   ``The close vote ... indicates that it's going to be a fairly
close vote on the floor,'' said Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, the
committee chairman.
   The AP survey said as much, and indicated that uncommitted
Democrats will play a large role in determining the fate of the
amendment.
   In the House, supporters and those leaning in favor outnumbered
opponents 255-115, with 289 votes required for passage, the survey
showed. Of the 63 who were undecided or had no known position, 53
were Democrats.
   The survey found 58 senators were either committed to or leaning
toward the amendment pushed by President Bush, leaving it nine
short of the 67 needed to pass.
   Twenty-four Democrats and four Republicans were either committed
or leaning against supporting the amendment.
   The top Democratic leadership in the House and Senate are
vehemently opposed to the amendment, but a vote against it is seen
by Democrats and Republicans alike as risky business in an election
year.
   Only a week ago, a Judiciary subcommittee cleared the amendment,
but by an unfavorable 5-3 vote that carried a recommendation
against passage. The full Judiciary Committee voted Tuesday to move
the amendment to the House floor but took no stand for or against
passage.
   Earlier Tuesday, Democratic opponents failed to get an adverse
recommendation and supporters failed to get a favorable
recommendation.
   At Brooks' urging, the panel voted on sending the amendment
forward with no recommendation. That carried by a 19-17 margin.
   During earlier committee arguments, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.,
told his colleagues:
   ``Those who are shocked and revolted and frustrated by the
excesses of the counterculture, the pornography, the obscenities
that inundates or entertainment industry, the drugs, the AIDS
explosion, the high abortion rate, view flag burning as one more
slap in the face at the millions of veterans.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, stood up on the
Senate floor Tuesday to declare: ``I oppose and condemn the burning
of the flag. I find it offensive and obnoxious. I'm proud to be an
American, proud of our flag.
   ``But I do not support changing the Constitution,'' he said.
   A vote on the amendment could come as early as Thursday in the
House and by the Fourth of July in the Senate.
   ``I don't know what the vote outcome will be,'' Mitchell had
said earlier. ``I expect it will be close.''
   The Democratic leadership, which sees the amendment as weakening
the First Amendment, is looking for votes to block the measure
among 18 undecided senators, 15 of them Democrats. They include
Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, who last year wrote the law the
Supreme Court struck down June 11.
   The AP survey was done June 15-18. Some members responded
through aides, some themselves.
   Just four Republican senators _ John Chafee of Rhode Island,
John Danforth of Missouri, Gordon Humphrey of New Hampshire and Bob
Packwood of Oregon _ are opposed.
   Thirty-eight Republicans said they would vote yes and three are
undecided.
   That the survey found so many Democrats on the fence so close to
a vote illustrates the political difficulty of the issue, which
Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., has quipped would make a good ``30-second
campaign spot.''
   But Rep. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., who was undecided last week,
said he found in a visit to his home district that the issue wasn't
pressing with constituents. He said he's now leaning against the
amendment.
   Some of those who said publicly they were undecided said
privately they were opposed to the GOP-backed amendment.
   Biden aides said he planned to offer his own amendment that
would bar physically defacing or burning the flag without
addressing whether the act desecrates the flag.
   Meanwhile, the Emergency Committee to Defend the First
Amendment, a private group that opposes the amendment, said Tuesday
that retired Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell had joined in the
call to reject the measure.
   But Powell told The Associated Press: ``I'd rather you just
state that I am a member of the committee, without any further
comment from me.''

<HEAD>US Not Seeking Doe Resignation, But Doubts He Can Survive Rebel
Attack</HEAD>

   The United States has not asked Liberian
President Samuel Doe to resign, but doesn't believe he can survive
a military battle with anti-government rebels, a top U.S. official
said Tuesday.
   Herman Cohen, the secretary of State for African affairs, told a
House panel the United States has encouraged both Doe and the
National Patriotic Front rebels to end bloody fighting in their
country and seek a political settlement, including free and fair
elections.
   Cohen said the U.S. military warships stationed off the coast of
Liberia are there solely ``for the purpose of protecting the lives
of U.S. citizens, should the level of violence place them in
jeopardy at a time when they have no other means of evacuating''
the country.
   ``There is no intention of using the (U.S) forces for any
political end; they are there to preserve American lives,'' he said.
   ``U.S. forces will not intervene to stop the fighting or to
influence the outcome of the conflict in any way,'' he said.
   The United States have not suggested to Doe that he resign, but
has talked with both sides in the conflict. Doe has said he will
not seek re-election, but he has not quit his post; the rebels say
there can be no elections until Doe is out of office.
   The United States has cut off aid, except for humanitarian aid,
to Liberia because of human rights problems.
   Moreover, Cohen said the United States has called on Doe and
rebel leader Charles Taylor to end human rights abuses and
atrocities that have left more than 1,000 dead and 200,000 homeless
since December.
   Church groups have sponsored mediation talks between Doe's
forces and those rebels headed by Charles Taylor, who is wanted by
the state of Massachusetts on a felony warrant for escaping from
prison.
   Right now, fighting is quiescent with rebel troops gathered
outside the Liberian capital of Monrovia at the Firestone
Plantation, Cohen said.
   But he said the rebels, who number more than 5,000, would likely
overpower the government forces, whose strength has dwindled to
about 1,000.
   The government army, instead of fighting the guerrillas, has
``taken out against the citizens instead,'' he said. Based on the
past performance of government troops, Cohen said ``it's not
likely'' they could defend Monrovia, should rebels attack.
   He said the United States wants the Liberians to ``avoid a
terrible battle for Monrovia.''
   As for Taylor, Cohen said it is unclear whether he is truly
committed to achieving a democratic government because he gives
ambiguous answers to questions.
   In sum, Cohen said the United States believes the Liberians _
not outsiders _ should resolve the country's problems.

<BYLINE>Owner, FAA Officials Defend New Certificate For `Celebrity Airline'
^By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The revival of a small charter airline known
for carrying celebrities but shut down nearly two years ago for
safety violations was defended Tuesday by federal authorities and
the carrier's owner.
   ``You do not fly the class of people that we flew unless you
have a reliable airplane,'' Earl Holtz, president of Northeast Jet,
told a congressional panel.
   The House Public Works oversight and investigations subcommittee
is looking into the Federal Aviation Administration's oversight of
small charter and air taxi services.
   Northeast gained the nickname ``Celebrity Airline'' by ferrying
clients such as first ladies Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush;
presidential candidates Michael Dukakis and Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan.;
and pop singers Billy Idol, Barry Manilow and Bruce Springsteen on
domestic and international flights.
   Holtz said the company still will accept any paying passengers.
His lawyer, Mark Kahan, said most of the passengers are corporate
travelers.
   Three of the airline's former employees told the subcommittee
that Holtz deserved to have his license pulled in September 1988.
   And Susan J. Woodward, a former Northeast Jet vice president,
said the company should not have been allowed to resume flights
last month as Private Jet Services.
   Ms. Woodward said the company's management ``abused license,
privileges and their employees.''
   Former Northeast Jet pilot Thomas Beamer testified that he had
been punished for refusing to fly excessive hours or overweight
planes and said he received inadequate training.
   Joan Szemplenkski, a former aircraft scheduler, said she
witnessed ``screaming matches'' between Holtz and the company's
chief maintenance officer over whether aircraft were airworthy.
   Former chief pilot William Telfer said the company kept records
that showed compliance when ``violations were in fact occurring on
a daily basis.''
   Holtz said the accusation ``that I skimped on safety to enrich
myself is not and never was true.'' He said the company had
well-maintained aircraft and a good training program.
   ``It is grossly unfair for employees with no specific knowledge
of the facts to suggest that I fixed problems illegally,'' Holtz
said.
   Loretta Alkalay, assistant chief counsel for FAA's Eastern
Region, said the FAA punished Northeast Jet by not allowing Holtz
to apply for a new certification for one year.
   She said that was ``a significant sanction, a significant
deterrent.''
   FAA regional operations branch manager Frederick Leonellis said
the airline was given a new certificate only after meeting a long
list of requirements.
   The FAA, which oversees the safety of all aircraft, checks to
see if an airline has proper equipment, qualified personnel and
proper maintenance and training programs, officials said.
   An FAA emergency revocation order grounded the airline. The
19-page order accused Northeast Jet of flying unsafe planes,
overworking its pilots, skimping on training and keeping two sets
of maintenance records: one for its own use and one for FAA
inspectors.
   The FAA cited more than 70 examples of unsafe or unauthorized
practices.
   National Transportation Safety Board records show four crashes
involving the airline and three fatalities since 1980.

<HEAD>EPA Chief Will Recommend Veto If Jobs Aid Provision Stands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William K. Reilly, administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency, said Tuesday that he would
recommend President Bush veto landmark clean air legislation if the
proposal contains a controversial jobs protection amendment when it
reaches the White House.
   ``I consider it bad environmental policy, bad social policy and
bad economic policy,'' Reilly said in discussing a provision that
would assist workers who lose their jobs because of the tougher air
pollution requirements.
   Both the Senate and House are preparing for a conference
committee to work out differences in largely similar bills to
strengthen federal clean air laws for the first time in 13 years.
   One of the differences involves an amendment in the House bill
that would allow for $250 million to be spent in added unemployment
compensation and retraining for workers if forced out of their jobs
by the new legislation.
   The administration says this could force industry spending well
above the $21 billion or so annually called for by the Senate
version, partly because it would be extremely difficult to tell if
a job had been lost because of the provisions of the legislation.
   Reilly said his objections to this jobs proposal, sponsored by
Rep. Bob Wise, D-W.Va., were strong enough that he would recommend
that the president veto the entire bill if that section is not
removed by the conference committee.
   Stressing that the administration is ``not insensitive to people
losing their jobs,'' Reilly said that of the 17,000 to 20,000 jobs
estimated to be lost by the tougher legislation, only 4,000 of
those job losses would occur by 1995.
   He said the major impact would not come until the next century,
giving society time to prepare through use of current job
retraining programs.
   The jobs issues is certain to be one of the main battles in the
conference committee debate. An aid package in the Senate sponsored
by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., lost by only one vote. Byrd's
amendment would have helped only coal miners while the less costly
Wise amendment expands the assistance to workers in all industries.
   Reilly, briefing economics writers on the economic impacts of
environmental legislation, said the United States spends between
$80 billion to $90 billion annually on pollution control, counting
in both government enforcement efforts and clean-up costs borne by
industry and consumers.
   He said the administration projected that environmental
spending, which already amounts to 1.5 percent to 1.7 percent of
the total U.S. economy, would rise to 2.5 percent of the gross
national product by the year 2000. He said this figure would be 3
percent if the costs of cleaning nuclear waste sites is included.
   Reilly said the administration understood the need ``to do all
we can to protect the environment, but to do it in a cost-effective
way.''

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms battered the lower and middle Missouri Valley and
numerous tornadoes were reported Tuesday, as much of the Northeast
got drenched, too.
   The National Weather Service received more than 100 reports of
large hail and damaging winds. The thunderstorms also spawned five
tornadoes in Nebraska and four in North Dakota.
   There were 17 reports of large hail in Nebraska and 33 reports
of damaging winds in New York state.
   In the East, afternoon showers and thunderstorms developed ahead
of a cold front from Pennsylvania to Maine, as well as in southern
Florida.
   Thunderstorms developing along a cold front produced severe
weather from North Carolina to New York state Tuesday.
   Afternoon thunderstorms produced severe weather in the central
Gulf Coast states, and thunderstorms developing along a cold front
in the nation's midsection produced severe weather across the
northern and central Plains region during the late afternoon and
evening.
   Strong southerly winds blew through Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas,
as well as from Missouri to Minnesota. Strong northwesterly winds
buffeted the northern Plains.
   Dry weather prevailed across the rest of the nation; skies were
sunny in the West.
   Temperatures rose into the 90s Tuesday afternoon from the
southern Atlantic Coast to the southern Plains, with readings near
100 degrees in parts of Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas.
   In the San Antonio area, the succession of hot days has caused
water supplies to drop at the rate of about a foot a day, officials
said. Rationing was under consideration in both San Antonio and New
Braunfels.
   ``This is murder, murder, murder,'' said New Braunfels assistant
city manager Hector Tamayo.
   It was 93 degrees in Miami, tying the record for the date set in
1953.
   Afternoon temperatures were mostly in the 70s from the northern
Plains to the Northeast, and in the 60s in the Great Lakes region.
   Temperatures were in the 60s along the northern Pacific Coast,
and soared above 100 degrees in the desert Southwest.
   The low in Lower 48 was 33 degrees at West Yellowstone, Mont.

<TEXT>
   The government on Tuesday asked the Soviet
Union to allow experts from Poland to take part in exhuming the
bodies of Polish officers massacred by the Soviet secret police in
World War II.
   The Foreign Ministry sent a diplomatic note to the Soviet
Embassy requesting Polish Red Cross experts be allowed to join in
the ``exhumation and identification work,'' the official PAP news
agency reported.
   The request followed the disclosure of the probable burial site
of some of the 6,200 Polish officers who were held in a prison camp
at Ostashkov, 120 miles northwest of Moscow.
   For 47 years the Soviets denied involvement in the murders of
nearly 15,000 Polish officers in Ostashkov and two other prison
camps. The crime became known as the Katyn massacre when more than
4,200 bodies of Polish officers were discovered in 1943 in the
forest at Katyn.
   But the burial sites of the rest, the elite of Polish society
called up from the reserves and captured after the Red Army invaded
eastern Poland in September 1939, remained a mystery.
   Soviet authorities acknowledged only in April that the officers
had been murdered in 1940 by Stalin's NKVD secret police and
intelligence agency, not by the Nazis as Moscow had claimed since
1943.
   Last week, the KGB, the NKVD's successor, identified a park
outside the Ukrainian city of Kharkov as the likely burial place of
3,900 of the Polish soldiers who had been held at the Starobielsk
camp.
   On Monday, Soviet officials told a Polish parliament delegation
they had located the apparent burial place of at least some of
6,200 officers held at Ostashkov prison, PAP said.
   The site is in a forest near Miednoye on the Moscow-Leningrad
highway north of Kalinin, about 90 miles from Moscow, PAP said.
   Mass graves of Stalinist victims, most of them Soviets, have
been discovered at the site. PAP, quoting sources close to the
Polish delegation, said that although no Polish remains have been
identified, ``much goes to indicate they rest there.''
   A parliamentary delegation planned to visit the Katyn and
Kharkov graves and discuss the legal and financial consequences,
including claims by the victims' families, PAP said.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Considers Constitutional Amendment To Reverse
Missouri Tax Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY MASSEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conservatives objected Tuesday to a Supreme
Court ruling that directed a local tax increase to correct school
segregation, but some legal scholars told a Senate panel the case
didn't warrant a constitutional amendment to reverse it.
   At issue is a 5-4 ruling in April that a federal judge could set
aside state tax limitations and order local officials to raise
taxes to correct a constitutional violation such as racial
segregation in schools. The case involved public schools in Kansas
City, Mo.
   Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., has proposed a constitutional
amendment to make clear that judges have no powers of taxation.
Danforth and other amendment supporters argued that the court
ruling was a straightforward example of the judiciary exercising a
legislative function by directing a property tax increase in Kansas
City.
   ``The decision is the predictable result of decades of relying
ever more heavily on judicial power to solve social and political
problems,'' Robert F. Nagel of the University of Colorado School of
Law told the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on the Constitution.
``It is the predictable result of power going unchecked.''
   But Nagel and other critics of the Supreme Court decision said
that if an amendment is not approved, legislation proposed by Sens.
Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., and Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., would suffice.
The measure would limit the remedial powers of federal judges by
prohibiting orders ``requiring the federal government or any state
or local government to impose any new tax or to increase any
existing tax or tax rate.''
   Conservative legal scholar Bruce Fein strongly criticized the
Danforth proposal for a constitutional amendment, saying it would
have a ``horrendous effect ... on simple justice'' by not
permitting courts to correct constitutional wrongs in some cases.
   ``I believe these proposals would foster arbitrary government,
throw a dagger at private and economic liberties and subvert the
rule of law,'' said Fein.
   Fein said critics misinterpreted the decision, saying it ``did
not endow judges with ... imperial power'' to raise taxes to any
level.
   Joining Fein in opposition to a constitutional amendment was
Patricia A. Brannan, a Washington attorney for the Kansas City
school district. She said the ruling followed a basic legal
principle that judges must have the power to correct constitutional
violations.
   ``To do less would permit the political reluctance to raise
taxes to deprive minorities of a remedy for demonstrated
constitutional violations,'' Brannan said in a statement.
   She pointed out that the Supreme Court held 9-0 in the Kansas
City case that a judge could not directly impose taxes. The
justices allowed the federal judge to block state laws that
prevented the board from increasing taxes enough to pay the
district's share of the desegregation plan.
   Missouri law requires voter approval before property taxes can
be increased above a certain levy and in some instances a
two-thirds majority is necessary. The locally elected school board,
she said, now sets the actual levy within limits allowed by the
courts.
   The school board supported several tax increases, but the voters
rejected the proposals.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., chairman of the Senate panel, said he
remained undecided on the proposals but was ``reluctant to take the
constitutional amendment approach.''

   A group of humanitarian, religious and
anti-war organizations claimed Tuesday that the U.S. is
strengthening the Khmer Rouge, a militant communist faction in
Cambodia, through its dealings with that nation.
   ``There's a great discrepancy between preachment and practice''
in the Bush administration's policy of condemning the Khmer Rouge
while aiding factions allied with it, Sidney Peck, co-chairman of
an effort to change the U.S. policy, said during a news conference.
   Public opinion is growing in the United States for blocking not
only a return to power but also any form of cooperation with the
Khmer Rouge, he said. Peck said the group has been blamed for more
than 1 million Cambodian deaths during its 1975-78 rule over the
Southeast Asian country.
   That message was stressed by members of the coalition of 45
organizations during a day of lobbying Congress, said Peck, who
heads Mobilization for Survival, a humanitarian aid group. He said
a delegation also discussed Cambodia with Richard Solomon, the
assistant secretary of state for East Asia.
   Coalition representatives said the agony of the Cambodian people
was being prolonged by U.S. insistence on a comprehensive Cambodian
peace package while the country endures deepening hardship from the
cutoff of aid from former communist countries in Europe.
   ``If we continue to say nothing is settled until everything is
settled, we may find we have lost everything ... the comprehensive
approach is at odds with a peace process approach (and) runs the
risk that it won't be settled at all,'' said Jeremy Stone,
president of the Federation of American Scientists, a peace
movement group.
   The campaign was triggered in part by Senate Democratic leader
George Mitchell's recent announcement of Intelligence Committee
oversight hearings to determine if the Bush administration's
Cambodia policy complied with Congress' bar on use of U.S. funds
that had the effect of helping or augmenting Khmer Rouge operations.
   Mitchell charged in a June 11 floor speech that the
administration ``has been slow to realize'' that its current policy
``in effect sanctions the return of the murderous Khmer Rouge.''
   Some lawmakers have talked of stronger restrictions and a House
subcommittee last week considered ending current ``non-lethal''
U.S. aid to the non-communist factions in Cambodia.
   David Elder of the American Friends Service Committee, a Quaker
organization, said U.S. policy, however intentioned, has had the
effect of creating ``a much stronger Khmer Rouge than before ...
visible to every visitor.''
   The coalition said it has documents and press reports showing
that the U.S.-aided non-communist factions headed by Prince Norodom
Sinhanouk and Son Sann have collaborated at the highest military
and intelligence levels with the Khmer Rouge in their joint fight
against the Hun Sen government in Phnom Penh. That government was
installed by Vietnamese troops who in 1979 ended Khmer Rouge rule
and occupied the country for 11 years.

   Dozens of people waited in line outside a
newly opened federal disaster relief center Tuesday to find out if
the government would help them rebuild lives washed away by a flash
flood.
   Nearly 60 flood victims gathered at the Shadyside Community
Center, where federal and state agencies began taking applications
for low-interest loans, grants and deposit money to help them find
temporary lodging.
   Rainstorms dumped 5{ inches of rain in about three hours
Thursday night, swamping two small creeks and washing away homes,
cars and trees in and around this rural eastern Ohio village. At
least 21 people were killed and 13 were listed as missing.
   Few people were insured for the damage caused by raging Wegee
and Pipe creeks. Some who came to fill out disaster relief
applications said they would never recover most of what they lost.
   Ben Otto said he bought $30,000 worth of flood insurance last
September, but estimated his house suffered another $70,000 in
damage that the insurance won't cover.
   ``I got mud up to here in my house,'' Otto said, holding his
hands just below his hips. ``I know I'll never get back what it's
worth from the government. I don't expect to.''
   Ken Gibbons, 41, who crawled into the rafters of his attic when
a 25-floot wall of water crashed into his home, said he sustained
$300,000 in losses. He said he had been told that he could only
recover about $10,400 in government grants.
   Like many of the relief applicants, Gibbons was bitter.
   ``There's too much red tape with the government,'' he said.
``They send money freely overseas to other countries, but don't
want to do anything to help people here. ... I'm going to move to
Florida and live with my daughter and become a beach bum. Let
welfare feed me. To hell with this.''
   In addition to his house, he said, the flood wiped out his
tavern, a Jaguar and a red Corvette convertible and two rental
mobile homes. He said the loss of the bar was the hardest blow.
   ``I had surgery ... to remove a brain tumor, and I wasn't able
to hold another job other than that bar,'' Gibbons said. ``I've had
that 15 years, and everybody in this town came down there for
entertainment. We were the only place around here that had live
bands.''
   Bruce Connor, 33, and two fellow members of the Sentinels
Motorcycle Club showed up in biker gear to file applications for
money to replace Harley-Davidson motorcycles they lost to the flood.
   ``I don't know if they'll accept it or not, but we're going to
try, just like everybody else,'' Connor said. ``Some of those bikes
were collectors' items, probably worth a lot of money. We had
Harleys from the 1920s and '30s, bikes my father and his father
had, and tools they used to work on them.''
   Gene Neiditch of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, who
manages the local application center, said the Sentinels might be
reimbursed.
   ``If those bikes were their primary source of transportation and

<HEAD>Taiwanese Businessmen Learn Hot Dog Business</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHERINE SCOBEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you want to learn, consult an expert. So three
Taiwanese entrepreneurs came to the Windy City to study the art of
making the classic, Chicago-style hot dog.
   ``We think that the era of hot dog is now,'' said Ko Sheng Yaw,
the 32-year-old president of Chicago Foods Co. Ltd. in Taipei.
   After five days behind the counter at Wolfy's, a hot-dog joint
on the North Side, Ko and his two associates will take their new
skills home Wednesday with the plan to open five or six hot-dog
outlets by year's end.
   Western fast food is well established in Taiwan; McDonald's,
Wendy's, Hardees, Burger King and Pizza Hut all have operations
there, according to Ko.
   But to Taiwanese, a hot dog is a pork or chicken sausage,
normally without condiments or bun.
   ``What I've got to do is introduce the way the real hot dog is
to my country fellows,'' Ko said.
   That means a beef hot dog on a bun, topped with onions,
tomatoes, mustard, peppers and a bun-length pickle wedge.
   But Ko said he'll leave behind the bright green relish
Chicagoans favor.
   To Taiwanese, he said, the color is ``too vivid to be true.''
   The men planned to shop for souvenirs to decorate their
restaurants _ Chicago Bears paraphernalia, pictures of the Sears
Tower _ ``to make it Chicago-connected,'' Ko said.
   To steep themselves in American marketing and fast-food service,
the men visited supermarkets and hot-dog stands, then spent five
days working for 65-year-old Mickey Becker, who's run Wolfy's for
24 years.
   In white plastic aprons and white paper chef's hats, Ko, his
sales manager and deputy manager took their places behind the
stainless-steel counter.
   ``We learn how to make the best quality for the customer,'' said
the sales manager, Yang Yuncheng, 31, who manned the french-fry
vats at lunch hour Tuesday. He has nearly mastered the wrist action
necessary to flip the fries in the basket to check for doneness.
   At about noon, a school group of about 150 teen-agers jammed the
restaurant. And the orders started coming.
   ``This is real rush hour,'' said Ko, who has picked up the
jargon, if not the precise syntax, of American English.
   Ko told Chao Ming, his deputy manager, to put more hamburger
buns in the toaster, then pulled a stack of cheese slices from the
refrigerator. Yang salted french fries and scooped them into
cardboard containers.
   ``Two tomatoes, two tomatoes,'' reminded Rita Rosenthal, a
13-year Wolfy's veteran, when Ko _ by now splattered with ketchup
and mustard _ put just one tomato slice on a hot dog.
   Ko also is vice president of Vienna Enterprise, which last year
contracted with the Chicago-based Vienna Sausage Manufacturing Co.
to sell Vienna Beef hot dogs in Taiwan.
   Vienna Sausage arranged the 10-day Chicago visit for Ko and his
staff.
   ``They have to do it themselves and see the importance of having
fresh ingredients and cooking the hot dog to the right temperature,
the whole nine yards,'' said Vienna Chairman James Eisenberg.
   Ko plans to sell hot dogs to grocers and through restaurants.
   A hot dog fan himself, he plans to promote his product with free
samples.
   ``Of course it will cost a lot, but it will be worth it _
otherwise they won't have their first bite,'' he said.

   About 1,000 supporters of the
Slovak National Party rallied Tuesday in downtown Bratislava to
celebrate the party's showing in this month's elections.
   ``Slovakia to the Slovaks, Slovaks arise,'' the crowd chanted
during the one-hour rally in the capital of the Slovak republic.
   The Slovak National Party, which advocates an independent Slovak
state, captured about 11 percent of the overall vote in the June
9-10 elections, winning 15 seats in the country's 300-seat
bicameral federal parliament. The party ran only in Slovakia.
   The winner in Slovakia was Public Against Violence, the sister
organization of the Civic Forum in the Czech republic, founded by
President Vaclav Havel. The two movements, which led last
November's peaceful revolution that overthrew the orthodox
Communist regime, won a total of 170 seats in the national
Parliament.
   The Communists came in second and the Christian Democrats a
disappointing third in the predominantly Catholic and rural
republic in the eastern part of the country. Slovaks represent
about a third of the country's 15.5 million people.
   The election's biggest surprise was the showing of the Slovak
nationalists. But they will be excluded from the coalition
governments being formed in the republic and at the national level,
according to Civic Forum and Public Against Violence.
   The Slovak nationalists are suspected by their opponents of
harboring sympathies for the Nazi-allied Slovak state created
during World War II.
   Party leaders deny these allegations.
   ``Our program is to create spiritual and material well-being in
Slovakia, with the perspective of joining confederated Europe as a
developed independent Slovak republic,'' party chairman Vitezslav
Moric told The Associated Press.
   The current Slovak Interior Minister, Vladimir Meciar, a member
of Public Against Violence, was entrusted last week with the task
of forming the new Slovak government.
   ``We do not want to join their coalition and they do not want to
work with us either,'' Moric said.
   A leading Public Against Violence official, Peter Tatar, accused
the Slovak National Party of exploiting ``the natural patriotic
emotions ... which can be stimulated in Slovakia through the
inferiority complex of a small nation.''
   ``Their image is built on the search for an enemy and they found
this enemy in the Czechs, the Hungarian minority and in fact any
ethnic group,'' Tatar said in an interview.

   Convicted drug dealer Charles Lewis,
testifying on the first day of Marion Barry's drug and perjury
trial, said Tuesday that he and the mayor repeatedly used drugs in
the Virgin Islands and smoked crack cocaine in Washington.
   Lewis described using cocaine with Barry and model Rasheeda
Moore once in June 1986 in a hotel room. ``We were all standing in
line. We were using straws,'' Lewis said.
   Prosecutors opened the trial charging that the three-term mayor
was ``smoking crack and using cocaine all over town for years.''
   Defense attorney R. Kenneth Mundy countered that Barry was a
victim of entrapment and said the trial would reveal ``the depths
to which the government was willing to go and did go'' to bring
down the mayor of the nation's capital.
   The two lawyers sparred before the jury while Barry watched
intently from the defense table. He wiped his forehead when he
heard Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Roberts say jurors would see
a government videotape made the night of Barry's arrest showing the
mayor ``smoking crack ... lighting with a cigarette lighter.
   ``Just like this,'' he added, extending his arms and inhaling
deeply.
   Barry has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor cocaine possession
charges, one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge and three felony
counts of lying to a grand jury about his alleged drug use.
   He could face up to 26 years in prison and fines of $1.85
million if convicted on all counts. The trial is expected to last
upwards of a month.
   ``While the defendant was preaching `down with dope' to the
community, he was putting dope up his nose,'' Roberts told jurors
in his opening statement. ``This case is about the other side, the
secret side, of Marion Barry.''
   Mundy told the 12 jurors and six alternates, ``This is a case
about deals the government made with the devil. Approximately seven
years ago, the government made a determination that it was going to
get Mr. Barry ... and that it was prepared to go to any lengths.''
   Lewis, a former city employee who pleaded guilty to cocaine
conspiracy charges last November, portrayed the mayor as an
experienced drug user. In a Dec. 16, 1988 visit to Lewis'
Washington hotel room, Barry shook rocks of crack cocaine out of a
matchbox and he returned the next night with crack cocaine hidden
in his pants leg.
   The two men fashioned a homemade pipe to smoke the crack, said
Lewis.
   The mayor told him when he ``was in the Virgin Islands, I take
care of him, when I was in D.C. he takes care of me,'' Lewis
testified.
   At one point, said Lewis, the mayor sent him out to buy crack
cocaine on the streets, which Lewis called a ``very easy'' task.''
   Lewis also said the two men used drugs at two Virgin Islands
hotels and aboard two boats in trips the mayor made to the islands
in 1986 and 1988.
   ``How many packets (of crack) did you and Mr. Barry smoke during
his trip to the Virgin Islands'' in 1988? asked Assistant U.S.
Attorney Judith Retchin.
   ``I would say somewhere near two dozen packets,'' replied Lewis.
   ``Who smoked more, you or Mr. Barry?''
   ``The mayor did,'' said Lewis. ``He smoked more than I do.''
   Lewis told of using cocaine supplied by Barry in a Virgin
Islands hotel room in June 1986 and was asked whether anyone else
used the drug.
   ``The mayor, Miss Moore,'' Lewis said.
   Lewis testified Barry also smoked marijuana on a boat trip later
that day.
   Lewis said he encouraged Moore, who cooperated in Barry's Jan.
18 arrest at a Washington hotel, and the mayor to use cocaine in
the boat's bathroom, out of sight of another couple on the cruise.
They made repeated trips to the lavatory, Lewis testified.
   He said that during a March 1988 trip, the mayor gave him $300
and asked him to buy crack cocaine.
   Lewis, Barry and several others consumed ``between 15 and 18
bags'' of the cocaine that had been bought with the $300, Lewis
testified.
   ``Then I went and bought some more,'' he said.
   When Retchin asked Lewis how crack cocaine had made him feel,
Lewis said, ``You feel good. You feel great, as a matter of fact.''
   Barry smiled broadly as Lewis further described the cocaine high.
   Lewis' testimony that he obtained drugs for the mayor, got money
from the mayor, and used drugs with him all relate to the felony
perjury charges against Barry. The mayor told a grand jury in
January 1989 that he had never given anything of value to Lewis,
used drugs with him or seen Lewis use or sell drugs, according to
the indictment.
   In his opening argument, Roberts portrayed Barry as a regular
drug user whose friends and acquaintances brought drugs to him even
at his City Hall office.

<HEAD>East German Leaders Get Death Threats After Red Army Captures</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   East German leaders have been receiving death
threats since the start of a sweep against leftist terrorists
sheltered by the former hard-line Communist government, an official
said Tuesday.
   East Germany's interior minister said a tip from a former member
of the country's now-disbanded Stasi secret police led police
Monday to Henning Beer, 31, suspected in the 1981 bombing of a U.S.
Air Force Base in West Germany.
   Beer was the ninth suspected member of the left-wing West German
Red Army Faction terrorist group captured since the sweep began on
June 6.
   It has been widely believed the secret police helped fugitive
members of the Red Army Faction resettle in the East.
   East Germany Interior Minister Peter-Michael Diestel said since
the arrests began, his office has been receiving up to five
anonymous death threat letters each day.
   Diestel said the threats are aimed at him, Prime Minister Lothar
de Maiziere and other officials.
   Red Army Faction members often claim responsibility for their
actions in the name of killed or imprisoned leftist terrorists.
   There are believed to be several dozen active members and
supporters of the Red Army Faction still at large.
   In an interview with West German television Diestel said: ``We
will continue to do our job.''
   Interior Minister Dietmar Schlee of West Germany's
Baden-Wuerttemberg state told reporters in East Berlin he fears
reprisal attacks in West Germany as a result of the crackdown.
   The Red Army Faction has been waging attacks against NATO, U.S.
and West German industrial targets since the early 1970s. Among
those killed were a U.S. soldier and leading West German bankers
and industrialists.
   The most recent victim, Deutsche Bank chief Alfred Herrhausen,
was killed in a November bombing attack.
   Terrorists claimed responsibility for the Herrhausen killing in
the name of the ``Commando Wolfgang Beer.''
   Wolfgang Beer, brother of the suspected terrorist arrested
Monday night was a Red Army Faction member killed in a July 1980
automobile accident. Leftist radicals have claimed that authorities
engineered his death.
   Diestel said that harboring West German terrorists was the
``personal hobby'' of former Communist leader Erich Honecker and
his ousted security chief, Erich Mielke.
   Diestel said there were no indications the terrorists used East
Germany as a base of operations for their attacks in West Germany.
   Beer and fugitive suspected terrorist Silke Maier-Witt, 40, were
both arrested Monday in Neubrandeburg, according to Diestel. He
said that for the first time a member of the disbanded Stasi secret
police give key information aiding in the capture, but provided no
further details.
   Both Beer and Ms. Maier-Witt had been living in East Germany
under false names.
   Diestel said he expects both to be tried in West Germany, along
with the others recently captured.
   In Karlsruhe, West Germany, a spokesman for the chief federal
prosecutor's office said Henning Beer is suspected in the Aug. 31,
1981, bombing of Ramstein Air Base. That attack in West Germany
seriously injured 17 people.
   Helmut Pohl, a member of the Red Army Faction has already been
tried and convicted of taking part in the Ramstein bombing.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney expressed
irritation Tuesday that his months-long review of the Pentagon's
costliest aircraft programs failed to turn up problems in the
Navy's planned new attack plane, the A-12.
   ``I was not happy to discover that the contractors were having
problems with the A-12. I have had sessions in which I've expressed
my views on that subject,'' Cheney told reporters following a
budget briefing at the Pentagon.
   Cheney was queried about the Navy's decision to order a special
review of the secret program, which came after the plane's joint
developers announced a delay in its progress _ a delay widely
interpreted as foreshadowing extra costs.
   Officials at McDonnell Douglas Corp. and General Dynamics Corp.,
had reported that the first flight of the plane would be delayed
until late 1991. The problems reportedly involve the plane's
composite materials, which save weight and lower radar reflections,
but are very difficult to fabricate into aircraft parts.
   The plane is considered to be the Navy's top aircraft priority,
given that it is destined to replace the service's aging fleet of
A-6 Intruder all-weather attack planes, a point Cheney stressed.
   ``We need the A-12 soon as we can get it into the force. So it
remains a priority program,'' he said.
   In a concession to congressional budget cutters, Cheney
announced in April that he was sharply cutting the proposed A-12
purchase. Although the Navy had originally planned to buy 858 of
the long-range, carrier-based aircraft, the secretary said he
envisioned buying only 620.
   No cost for the super-secret program has been made public, but
it has been reported that the plane was being developed under a
$4.8 billion fixed price contract. Extended production would cost
tens of billions more.
   The secretary was asked whether he was unhappy that the problems
with the aircraft had not surfaced during the review, which
supposedly included top-to-bottom looks at the B-2 Stealth bomber,
the C-17 transport plane and other advanced tactical fighter
programs.
   ``We're going to continue to work the problem to see if we can,
in fact, get better data than we've had to date,'' Cheney replied.
   ``One of the problems you're faced with from time to time in
this business, is ... the problems of cost overruns and slips in
schedule,'' Cheney said, adding, ``But, obviously, I was not happy
with the way the A-12 thing was handled.''
   The secretary, pressed why the problems didn't emerge in the
review, said, ``That's the question I've asked and I don't have all
the answers yet.''
   He said he's made his dissatisfaction known ``in terms of my
personal conversations with the people who work for me, but I
prefer to keep those matters personal.''
   Cheney met last week on the A-12 with the chief executive
officers of McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics, as well as
Deputy Secretary Donald Atwood, Undersecretary of Defense for
Acquisition John Betti and Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III.

   The prosecution rested its case Tuesday in the
federal fraud trial of former Philippine first lady Imelda Marcos
and Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi, and defense lawyers said they
planned to call no witnesses.
   The jury is to begin deliberations next week following motions
and closing arguments.
   ``In our view, the government has utterly failed in its case.
You only call witnesses if you have a case to rebut,'' said Mrs.
Marcos' attorney, Gerry Spence.
   The prosecution called 95 witnesses during the three-month trial
in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
   They included former Marcos associates who described a pattern
of corruption they said enriched Mrs. Marcos and her late husband,
Ferdinand E. Marcos, during his 20 years in power.
   Other witnesses traced the flow of more than $220 million in
allegedly stolen funds from secret Manila bank accounts through
Swiss and U.S. banks to the purchase of four New York commercial
buildings, jewelry and art works.
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, is charged with racketeering, racketeering
conspiracy, mail fraud and obstruction of justice. If convicted,
she faces a maximum of 50 years in prison and a $1 million fine.
   Khashoggi is accused of helpingn, Peterson said Khashoggi told
him in January 1986, two months before the court order, that he had
acquired ``an interest'' in several New York buildings.

   The new president of Namibia, a socialist who
spent 30 years in exile, asked President Bush Tuesday to increase
aid to his newly independent nation.
   President Sam Nujoma said Bush was ``quite positive'' in his
response when Nujoma asked for an increase in the $10 million in
assistance already promised by the United States.
   However, administration officials said no further aid was
immediately envisioned for the southwest African nation although
Bush told Nujoma that the United States wants to provide moral
support for the emerging democracy and its move to a free market
economy.
   The U.S. assistance is less than that promised by Britain, India
and the Nordic countries. But neither the Soviet Union nor South
Africa has pledged any money yet, Nujoma said.
   He did not say how much more money he was seeking from the U.S.
He will travel to the United Nations later this week to seek
support from the international community. In particular, the 1.5
Namibians need help in education, housing, health care and
agricultural and rural development.
   ``We would do whatever we could to be helpful,'' said an
administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Another official said the main purpose of Bush's meeting with
Nujoma was to encourage the new president's efforts toward a mixed
economy and moderation of his socialist views.
   The White House also announced Tuesday that Bush will name Genta
Hawkins Holmes ambassador to Namibia. Holmes is the deputy chief of
mission at the U.S. embassy in Pretoria, South Africa, and
previously served as deputy chief of mission in Haiti and Malawi.
   Namibia formally gained its independence from 75 years of South
African rule on March 21 when power was turned over to an
independent government headed by Nujoma. Namibia was under South
Africa's control as a trusteeship until U.N. supervised elections
were held last November.
   The independence process occurred after a guerrilla war lasting
nearly 30 years that was waged by black nationalists. Nujoma heads
the South West Africa People's Organization, the rebel group that
fought the war and won the most votes in the balloting last fall.
   U.S. officials see Namibia as an example of a general trend
toward democratic rule in Africa. Namibia is one of the first
African countries to gain independence with an elected government,
and independent judiciary and curbs on the power of the executive.
   Nujoma is focusing his attention on economic reform.
   ``We have requested the U.S. government to increase financial
support the agricultural, rural development, education, health care
... in order to uplift the standard of living for the people of
Namibia,'' Nujoma told reporters after his meeting with Bush.
   He said his country is grateful for the $10 million offered by
the United States, but needs more to help cope with debts left by
the South African government.
   Namibia's per capita income of $1,000 a year is among the
highest in Africa, but it is partly based on South African aid,
which is ending with independence.
   The country faces a $191 million budget deficit this year on an
overall budget of just over $766 million.
   The Bush administration lifted economic sanctions against
Namibia when the country became independent.
   The sanctions were directed against South Africa and were
carried over to Namibia because it was under South African control.
The sanctions remain in place against South Africa.

   The FBI has documented at least 25 cases of
harassment and intimidation of Chinese students by their own
government in the United States, but the State Department does not
believe that is grounds for sanctions against Beijing, a department
official said Tuesday.
   Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., reacting to information given in a
closed-door FBI briefing, called the administration's position
``shocking'' and bluntly told the official: ``I'm not sure we're
living in the same universe.''
   Solarz said the briefing clearly showed a consistent pattern of
intimidation that requires sanctions under a law he wrote nine
years ago.
   ``It's going on in every region of the country,'' said Solarz,
who added that he believed the evidence points to hundreds of cases
in which Chinese Embassy officials have threatened students in the
United States.
   The Bush administration has announced its intention to renew
most-favored-nation trading status for China, almost exactly a year
after Beijing's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in
and around Tiananmen Square.
   Kent Wiedemann, director of the State Department's office of
Chinese affairs, said the contacts with students involved
relatively few of the Chinese Embassy and consular officials in the
United States and represented ``a very sporadic pattern.''
   ``They were mostly in 1989, in the summer and fall, and have
dwindled to basically nothing by the beginning of this year,''
Wiedemann told a joint hearing of Solarz's Asia subcommittee and
the human rights subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee.
   The contacts usually involved threats or implied threats of
consequences for students when they return to China, or to their
families, if they continued pro-democracy activities, he said.
   But they were ``sufficiently few in number and sufficiently
indirect as to not be a consistent pattern'' as the law defines it,
he said.
   Solarz bristled at the testimony, saying the administration
``seems to be more interested in kowtowing to China than in calling
a spade a spade.''
   He pointed to documents produced by Lin Xu, a former Chinese
Embassy official in Washington who sought political asylum in the
United States on May 2. The papers, which Wiedemann said he
believes authentic, describe a plan to pressure the most activist
students into inaction by threatening not to renew passports or to
deny their families in China permission to come to the United
States for visits.
   Xu, testifying later before the subcommittees, said the
harassment has intensified this year.
   Speaking through a translator, he said the Embassy's activities
included keeping dossiers on activist students, videotaping
protests, enlisting ``professional students'' to spy on their peers
and warning students not to lobby Congress on behalf of legislation
protecting them from deportation.
   He said about 200 students were placed into ``Category Five,''
the group of the most active pro-democracy leaders who were
subjected to the greatest intimidation.
   There are about 40,000 Chinese students in the United States.

   A Soviet official said it could take
more than 200 years to clean up damage from the 1986 Chernobyl
nuclear accident and asked for international aid to help 2 million
people affected by the disaster.
   The sudden plea _ more than four years after the accident _
comes after Soviet scientists said the situation was much worse
than Moscow had portrayed.
   One-fifth of the republic of Byelorussia's more than 10 million
people have to be moved from areas contaminated by radiation, said
Victor Borovikov, a Byelorussia diplomat. He said that includes 27
cities and more than 2,600 villages.
   Byelorussia, which has no nuclear power plants, was hit by 70fallout
from the nuclear power plant at Chernobyl,
in the Soviet Republic of Ukraine.
   Borovikov said 25,000 people were ev
percent of the acuated after the April 26,
1986, nuclear plant disaster. But, he said, ``then Moscow said
there was no panic, no danger. In the past four years we've
realized the situation was not so simple.''
   He said the republic had planned to spend $14 billion to move
180,000 people from the high-radiation zone by the end of 1995 but
would now try to do it by the end of 1991.
   Borovikov was in Brussels for the departure Wednesday of a truck
convoy carrying donated children'He said experts now say it could take
up to 200 years ``to
totally wipe out'' effects of the accident, so authorities are
focusing on reducing the damage.
   ``We have no experience in this field, which is why we're asking
for international help,'' said Borovikov, the republic's U.N.
ambassador in Vienna.
   Borovikov said immediately after the accident people were paid
by the Soviet authorities to stay in the contaminated zones but
they now are demanding immediate relocation.
   He said people in uncontaminated areas don't ``want to accept
the newcomers. They tell their children not to play with the
children of the newcomers.''
   At least 31 people were killed after a nuclear reactor exploded
at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. It was the worst nuclear
accident in history.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Francois Mitterrand said in an interview
published Tuesday that the European Community and other wealthy
Western countries should consider extending financial aid to the
Soviet Union.
   Mitterrand told the newspaper Le Monde that he hoped the EC and
other wealthy nations would consider the possibility of
``financial, commercial and technical aid'' to the Soviets.
   He said he would make a proposal to this effect at the upcoming
EC summit meeting in Dublin, Ireland, and the subsequent summit in
Houston of leaders of the seven major Western industrial
democracies.
   ``If (Soviet President) Mikhail Gorbachev succeeds, that would
be in the interest of all,'' Mitterrand told the newspaper.
   ``That would mean that he would have improved the quality of
life for the Soviets and had relaxed, decentralized and adapted the
Soviet Union's constitutional and political system. I believe he is
capable of this, although it is a terribly difficult task.''

<HEAD>Groups Claim U.S. Policy Helps Khmer Rouge</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of humanitarian, religious and
anti-war organizations claimed Tuesday that the U.S. is
strengthening the Khmer Rouge, a militant communist faction in
Cambodia, through its dealings with that nation.
   ``There's a great discrepancy between preachment and practice''
in the Bush administration's policy of condemning the Khmer Rouge
while aiding factions allied with it, Sidney Peck, co-chairman of
an effort to change the U.S. policy, said during a news conference.
   Public opinion is growing in the United States for blocking not
only a return to power but also any form of cooperation with the
Khmer Rouge, he said. Peck said the group has been blamed for more
than 1 million Cambodian deaths during its 1975-78 rule over the
Southeast Asian country.
   That message was stressed by members of the coalition of 45
organizations during a day of lobbying Congress, said Peck, who
heads Mobilization for Survival, a humanitarian aid group. He said
a delegation also discussed Cambodia with Richard Solomon, the
assistant secretary of state for East Asia.
   Coalition representatives said the agony of the Cambodian people
was being prolonged by U.S. insistence on a comprehensive Cambodian
peace package while the country endures deepening hardship from the
cutoff of aid from former communist countries in Europe.
   ``If we continue to say nothing is settled until everything is
settled, we may find we have lost everything ... the comprehensive
approach is at odds with a peace process approach (and) runs the
risk that it won't be settled at all,'' said Jeremy Stone,
president of the Federation of American Scientists, a peace
movement group.
   The campaign was triggered in part by Senate Democratic leader
George Mitchell's recent announcement of Intelligence Committee
oversight hearings to determine if the Bush administration's
Cambodia policy complied with Congress' bar on use of U.S. funds
that had the effect of helping or augmenting Khmer Rouge operations.
   Mitchell charged in a June 11 floor speech that the
administration ``has been slow to realize'' that its current policy
``in effect sanctions the return of the murderous Khmer Rouge.''
   Some lawmakers have talked of stronger restrictions and a House
subcommittee last week considered ending current ``non-lethal''
U.S. aid to the non-communist factions in Cambodia.
   David Elder of the American Friends Service Committee, a Quaker
organization, said U.S. policy, however intentioned, has had the
effect of creating ``a much stronger Khmer Rouge than before ...
visible to every visitor.''
   The coalition said it has documents and press reports showing
that the U.S.-aided non-communist factions headed by Prince Norodom
Sinhanouk and Son Sann have collaborated at the highest military
and intelligence levels with the Khmer Rouge in their joint fight
against the Hun Sen government in Phnom Penh. That government was
installed by Vietnamese troops who in 1979 ended Khmer Rouge rule
and occupied the country for 11 years.

   An eerie calm marked the conversations between
the copilot and air traffic controllers before a Colombian jetliner
ran out of fuel and crashed last January in New York, according to
tapes played Tuesday by federal regulators.
   Avianca Flight 52 plowed into a hillside in suburban Cove Neck,
Long Island, killing 73 of 158 aboard, including the three-man
cockpit crew. The disaster occurred Jan. 25 after the plane missed
its first approach to Kennedy International Airport and was going
around for another attempt.
   On the tapes played at Federal Aviation Administration
headquarters, the copilot sounded almost blase as he told air
traffic controllers the plane was running low on fuel.
   ``Climb and maintain 3,000 and, uh, we're running out of fuel,
sir,'' the copilot told a controller after the plane missed its
first approach to Kennedy in heavy fog and wind.
   Asked whether the plane had enough fuel to fly 15 miles to the
northeast and turn around for another approach, the copilot said
almost timidly, ``I guess so. Thank you very much.''
   Nor was there a trace of panic when, minutes later, the Avianca
copilot radioed: ``Avianca zero-five-two, we just, ah, lost two
engines and we need priority, please.''
   The controller then told the plane to turn left, but Avianca 52
never replied. In between giving instructions to another plane, the
controller calmly called twice again for Flight 52.
   No answer.
   Then the controller said evenly, ``Avianca zero-five-two radar
contact lost.''
   By then, the plane had crashed in Cove Neck, an affluent New
York City suburb. The flight had originated in Bogota and Medellin,
Colombia.
   The National Transportation Safety Board scheduled hearings
Wednesday and Thursday in Melville, N.Y., into the cause of the
crash.
   The tapes played Tuesday confirmed earlier reports that the
copilot never used the word ``emergency'' in describing the plane's
situation. According to transcripts of the cockpit conversations,
released in March, the pilot told the copilot twice in Spanish to
tell air traffic controllers the plane was in emergency.
   Had the copilot used the word ``emergency,'' the plane would
have gotten immediate clearance to land. Instead, it was kept in a
holding pattern for more than an hour before starting its first
landing approach.
   The tapes also underscored how many flights were stacked up
outside Kennedy that evening. Another flight, on American Airlines,
also reported having ``enough fuel for the approach and landing and
that's it.''
   Several flights reported encountering wind shear, a dangerous,
unpredictable crosswind.
   At one point, a controller in the Kennedy tower got confused as
to whether he was talking to an Avensa flight or the doomed Avianca
jet.

   East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere said
Tuesday that a unified Germany cannot belong to NATO unless the
organization's structure and strategies are ``radically modified.''
   De Maiziere said the unification of East Germany and West
Germany should be seen as part of a pan-European process and
stressed that the future security of Europe should be based on
``collective'' structures.
   One must not ``displace the blocs but go beyond them,'' he said.
But he added that ``intermediary structures'' were necessary.
   ``A united Germany belonging to NATO would not be acceptable to
our neighbors to the East unless the structures and strategies of
NATO are radically modified,'' de Maiziere said. He was speaking at
a news conference at the end of a two-day visit.
   He expressed hope that at the July meeting of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization progress would be made on this issue.
   De Maiziere also expressed concern that West German companies
were exporting products to East Germany and not moving factories to
produce such goods into the East.
   ``This evolution risks dividing Germany anew,'' he said, ``a
rich one and a poor one. ... There, history has already left us a
heavy heritage.''

<HEAD>Appeals Panel Says FEC Ruled Improperly In Campaign Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court panel ruled Tuesday
that the Federal Election Commission ruled improperly that spending
limits had not been exceeded in the 1983 Senate campaign of Dan
Evans in Washington State.
   The court reversed an earlier U.S. District Court decision
approving of the FEC's action. The case was sent back to the lower
court for reconsideration.
   The citizens lobby group, Common Cause, had complained to the
election commission that two Republican political action committees
were affiliated and had ``coordinated'' their spending on Evans
behalf. Together the funds exceeded the federal limit.
   The groups were the Republican National Independent Expenditure
Committee (RNIEC) and the National Republican Senatorial Committee
(NRSC).
   Evans, who had been appointed to fill the seat left vacant by
the death of Sen. Henry M. Jackson, won a full term in a special
election in November 1983. He has since left the Senate.
   ``We are unable to uphold the commission's decision ... because
it gives no indication that the agency considered whether the NRSC
and the RNIEC were affiliated,'' said the appeals court. ``The
brief lacks any discussion of the affiliation issue that is
independent of the analysis of the separate coordination issue.''
   Under the law, affiliated political action committers are those
that are established, financed, maintained or controlled by the
same person or group.
   In the course of the 1983 campaign, Democrats had complained
that RNIEC, which had been set up by Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., spent
$185,000 in ``electiongrams' to Republicans in Washington State
urging them to turn out to vote in the special election. The RNSC
already had put the maximum $260,000 into Evans' race.
   Common cause claimed Rodney Smith served as financial director
and treasurer of the NRSC until two months before he became a
co-founder of the other group and that Heinz continued to be a
member of NRSC a short time after he became involved with RNIEC.
   The appeals court said ``there is simply no indication'' that
the FEC ever considered whether Smith or Heinz had authority or
influence over the two committees.

<HEAD>Safety Board Scores Railroad, Pipeline Company In Double Accident</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Federal safety investigators blamed both a
railroad and a pipeline company Tuesday for inadequate procedures
in a May 1989 derailment and resulting pipeline explosion that
killed six people in San Bernardino, Calif.
   The National Transportation Safety Board said the Calnev Pipe
Line Co. gasoline pipeline was damaged by earth-moving equipment
clearing the 69-car Southern Pacific train that ran off the rails
into several houses after speeding out of control down an incline.
   Four people were killed in the May 12 derailment and two in the
petroleum pipeline explosion and fire nearly two weeks later.
   The board said the probable cause of the train derailment was
failure to determine the accurate weight for the train on that
run,; failure to communicate to communicate to the engineer that
fewer engines than he thought had working dynamic brakes and the
inadequacy of Southern Pacific rules on allowable speed and brake
operation down the incline.
   Dynamic braking is the running of the electric motors on the
engine as generators and dissipating the electrical energy thus
produced in a bank of resistors.
   The NTSB blamed the pipeline accident on inadequate testing and
inspection of the line following the derailment. It said Calnev's
failure to inspect and test check valves on the 14-inch pipe also
contributed to the accident.
   The four-member board, which investigates all major
transportation and pipeline accidents, issued 23 recommendations
for federal and local action.
   The independent board. which held a hearing on the accident last
year in San Bernardino, has no regulatory powers but its
recommendations often lead to new procedures to improve safety.
   The board advised Southern Pacific to require train dispatchers
and train operators to improve communication on condition of the
train, the number of locomotives with functioning dynamic brakes,
the tonnage of the train and other items critical to safety.
   Investigators determined that only three of the six locomotives
on the Southern Pacific train had functioning dynamic brakes while
the engineer in the lead engine thought he had four.
   The train's total weight was incorrectly estimated in Southern
Pacific's computerized system at 6,150 tons when it was actually
9,000 tons, board staff investigators said, and the railroad's
computers could still list the wrong weights for operating crews
even after changes made by Southern Pacific following the accident.
   ``Based on actual tonnage, available dynamic brakes and Southern
Pacific operating rules, (the train) should not have been permitted
to operate down the 2.2 percent grade,'' the board said in its
conclusions.
   ``The head-end engineer may have been able to bring the train
safely down the hill had he crested the hill at 15 mph, which he
would have been required to do if the dispatcher had informed him
of the correct trailing tonnage.''
   It said the railroad's operating rules provided ``inadequate
guidance to the head engineer on the allowable speed'' and air
brake settings down the grade.
   It recommended that Calnev test all mainline check valves
annually.

   The Bush administration responded coolly on
Tuesday to an Israeli peace overture to Syria and dealt cautiously
with the new government in Jerusalem.
   The administration kept talking to the Palestine Liberation
Organization, even as it withheld a judgment on the way Chairman
Yasser Arafat has handled an attempt by guerrillas to raid a Tel
Aviv beach last month.
   A State Department spokesman, Richard Boucher, said he knew of
no plans to invite the new Israeli foreign minister, David Levy, to
Washington.
   The usually warm relations with Israel turned chilly last week
when Secretary of State James A. Baker III questioned Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's commitment to peace talks. ``The phone
number (of the White House switchboard) is 202-456-1414,'' he said
in remarks during a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing. ``When
you're serious about peace, call us.''
   On Monday, in another thrust at Shamir's hard-line Likud
government, the White House disclosed President Bush had written
the prime minister to find out whether he supports his own plan for
Palestinian elections.
   In the letter, Bush urged Shamir to open a dialogue with
Palestinian Arabs. Shamir, who last year proposed negotiations with
elected Palestinian representatives on the West Bank and in Gaza,
said Monday he would reply to Bush.
   Despite the tensions in U.S.-Israeli relations, a senior
administration official said that Washington ``is not going to turn
its back on the Middle East situation, no matter what happens. We
have a lot of friends out there, both in Israel and in Arab
countries.
   ``We will work every hard to stay engaged,'' the official said,
insisting on anonymity. The official added, ``There is absolutely
no daylight between the president and Secretary Baker'' on the
Middle East.
   On Tuesday, the State Department commented tersely on Shamir's
invitation to President Hafez Assad of Syria to visit Jerusalem for
peace talks.
   ``The U.S. supports contacts between Israel and its neighbors,''
Boucher said at the daily State Department briefing.
   He used the same word _ ``contacts'' _ to describe the talks
Robert Pelletreau Jr., the U.S. ambassador to Tunisia, has held
with PLO officials even after the Palestine Liberation Front
claimed responsibility for the attempted May 30 raid on Tel Aviv.
   ``There have been continuing contacts ... but I don't have any
details to add,'' Boucher said.
   Abul Abbas, leader of the PLF, is a member of the PLO Executive
Committee. The State Department has been urging Arafat to denounce
the raid and discipline Abbas.
   ``When we have something to say, we'll say it,'' Boucher said to
a question about the 16-month U.S. dialogue.
   Shamir's invitation to Assad appeared to be an attempt to show
the Bush administration the new government in Jerusalem seeks peace
with its Arab neighbors.
   Last Tuesday, the Israeli Cabinet secretary, Eliakhim
Rubinstein, flew to Washington to inform the Bush administration
the Shamir government is determined to come to peace terms with its
neighbors.
   Rubinstein met with Robert Kimmitt, the under secretary of state
for political affairs; Dennis Ross, the head of the State
Department's policy planning staff; and John Kelly, the assistant
secretary of state for the Near East.
   Meanwhile, U.S. Ambassador William Brown met in Israel with
Shamir and with Levy, who is recovering from a mild heart attack.
   Boucher said he knew of no invitation to Levy, who is largely an
unknown figure to U.S. policy-makers, to visit Washington. Nor,
Boucher said, did he know of any telephone contacts between Baker
and Levy.
   ``We have an embassy there and we're in very close touch with
the Israeli government all the time about a variety of issues,''
the spokesman said.
   Baker dealt closely with Levy's predecessor, Moshe Arens, the
American-educated engineer who has shifted to defense minister.
Unlike Arens, who grew up in New York City, and most prominent
Israelis, Levy does not speak English.

<DATELINE>CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Publisher Roy McDonald, who turned a
free weekly newspaper into one of Tennessee's most successful and
distinctive papers, died Tuesday at age 88.
   McDonald, founder and owner of the Chattanooga News-Free Press
and the Chattanooga Publishing Co., died in his sleep at his home
on nearby Lookout Mountain, family members said.
   Known to friends, family and the city as ``Mr. Roy,'' McDonald
had a reputation as both a hard-nosed businessman and a generous
boss who earned his employees' loyalty.
   The publisher, who even in his 80s remained a daily fixture in
the News-Free Press newsroom, worked in his office as usual Monday,
the day before he died.
   McDonald was remembered for his circulation battles with The
Chattanooga Times, which ended in an antitrust settlement and a
joint operating agreement with the other paper.
   ``I knew him both as a formidable competitor and as a fair and
collegial partner,'' said Ruth S. Holmberg, publisher of The
Chattanooga Times.
   ``His wit and personal charm, his strongly held views, his
faultless memory, his fierce loyalty to family and friends, his
devotion to his craft all combined to create one of the most
memorable persons in my life.''
   McDonald, who proudly called himself ``a merchant, not a
journalist,'' started the Free Press in 1933 as an advertising
circular delivered door-to-door at no charge.
   In 1936, it became a daily paper with afternoon and Sunday
editions, and three years later McDonald bought the financially
troubled Chattanooga News to create the current paper.
   The News-Free Press has a conservative editorial policy and a
style that includes a standard streamer headline on the front page
and many photographs.
   ``I always felt that running a picture was cheaper than setting
type,'' said McDonald, who routinely spent part of each afternoon
laying out ads for the next day's paper. ``The only thing you were
out was newsprint.''
   Funeral services were set for Friday.
   Survivors include his wife, Elizabeth McDonald, and five
children: Frank McDonald, the newspaper's president; Helen Exum,
Betsy Anderson, Dr. Martha McDonald of Memphis and Nancy Reinke of
Arlington, Va.

   Government troops blasted and burned
rebel bunkers Tuesday, pushing Tamil Tiger guerrillas into jungles
in the east, the military said.
   Deputy Defense Minister Ranjan Wijeratne told Parliament the
offensive would crush the rebels. ``There is no escape for the
Tigers. ... They will have to die here,'' he said.
   In other eastern areas and in the north, the rebel force _ known
as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam _ launched its own
offensive and relentlessly rained government positions with mortars
and rockets, military officials said.
   The military officials, who cannot be named under briefing
rules, said at least three rebels were killed and three policemen
injured when commandos clashed with the Tigers near Tirrukkovil in
eastern Ampara district.
   They said a rebel leader, identified only as Dayaparan, was
fatally shot by soldiers in northern Vavuniya district, where the
guerrillas stepped up rocket and mortar attacks on a military camp.
   According to reports by witnesses, military sources and Tiger
officials, about 1,000 people have died in fighting that began June
11 when a 13-month-old cease-fire collapsed. The guerrillas have
been fighting since 1973 for a separate homeland.
   The Tigers apparently remained in control of the predominantly
Tamil north.
   But the government attack on their bunkers drove them from
Batticoloa district in the east.
   The Tigers alleged Tuesday that the government offensive had
forced more than 100,000 Tamils and Moslems to flee their homes in
the district.
   Batticaloa town, 136 miles from Colombo on the eastern coast,
had been the flashpoint in the week's fighting.
   Sri Lankan military officials in Colombo said dozens of armored
personnel carriers and soldiers on foot moved out of an air base
and a military camp Tuesday and blasted their way into Batticaloa
town.
   Residents contacted by telephone said they heard bombs explode
and could see columns of smoke. The residents, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said civilians stayed inside when the
soldiers moved in.
   The military officials said soldiers first cordoned the town,
then destroyed rebel bunkers and cleared land mines and booby traps.
   Hundreds of troop reinforcements Tuesday reached the besieged
military camps at Kiran and Kalawanchukudi in Batticaloa district,
forcing the Tigers to retreat into the jungles, the officials said.
   In the northern Jaffna peninsula, soldiers used helicopters and
armored cars to repulse a rebel attack, they said.
   In the Indian city of Madras, six unidentified gunmen burst into
a house where moderate Sri Lankan Tamil leaders were staying and
opened fire, killing 13 people, including at least seven of the
leaders, the Press Trust of India reported.
   Madras, the capital of India's Tamil Nadu state, has been used
as a base by several Sri Lankan separatist groups.
   Most of India's 60 million Tamils live in Tamil Nadu, which is
separated from Sri Lanka by a narrow sea strait.
   The cease-fire was called in May 1989 after the two sides opened
negotiations to end the Tamil revolt against the
Sinhalese-dominated government.
   At least 11,000 people have been killed in fighting since 1983.
   During negotiations, the government had pledged to delegate
provincial autonomy to the Tamils in the north and the east, where
the rebels control most of the major towns. At the same time, it
allowed the Tigers virtually a free hand in the region.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people, and
they claim they are discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese
who make up 75 percent of the population.

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's largest hotel _ a giant castle with
court jesters, friendly dragons, slot machines and poker tables _
opened with medieval fanfare Tuesday on the Las Vegas Strip.
   The 4,032-room Excalibur is the latest effort to lure middle
America to this gaming capital. It was built for a modest $290
million, less than half the pricetag of the recently-opened Mirage
hotel. Rooms start at $45 a night.
   An estimated 30,000 tourists and local residents swarmed into
the sprawling resort for the ribbon-cutting, and a flood of the
curious swept through the main entrance before the ceremony was
done.
   Hotel executives stood aside as customers lined up by the
hundreds at check-in counters and set slot machines whirring.
   ``This shows that bigger can be better,'' Gov. Bob Miller said.
   Hotel officials expected a full house Tuesday night.
   Hundreds of Las Vegas business, political and social figures
received a sneak preview Monday night.
   ``Isn't this the most sensational thing you've ever seen?''
actor Ernest Borgnine enthused as he watched a knight on a white
horse prance across a lobby. ``Just look at this. What can you
possibly say?''
   Minstrels, jugglers and harpists entertained guests, a 10-foot
dragon cavorted and a man in a suit of armor walked stiffly amid
the guests. The entertainers will be standard fare at the hotel,
which mixes some of the aura of a theme park with the glitz of a
casino.
   Tuesday's formal opening marked a milestone for Circus Circus
Enterprises Inc., the gaming-hotel operation that has carved a
niche for middle America in Nevada.
   The $1.6 billion Circus Circus company, which started with a
single struggling Strip hotel-casino 16 years ago, has become the
envy of the gaming industry with a strategy focusing on low-rollers
rather than coveted high-rollers.
   Chairman William Bennett announced to stockholders last week
that the company planned to reduce its $500 million debt by about
$200 million in the coming year, largely on added revenue from the
Excalibur.
   Glenn Schaeffer, chief financial officer for Circus Circus, said
the company could probably pay off all its debt in three or four
years from Excalibur revenue, but may opt to look at new projects.
   Schaeffer said the company, which once eyed Atlantic City, now
has no interest in expanding to New Jersey. ``Our desire is to have
the strongest balance sheet in the industry,'' he said.
   The Excalibur is anchored by four 28-story towers and covers 70
acres. It has about 500,000 square feet of public entertainment
space, including a Renaissance village, 12 food outlets and a
casino the size of four football fields, with 2,630 slot machines.
Shows will feature a medieval flair, with live jousting.
   An arcade will feature a dozen themed game booths such as
archery and electronic crossbows.
   The hotel has 4,300 workers, enough wallcovering to paper an
area 10 acres in size, enough carpeting to blanket 11 football
fields.
   It will replace another Las Vegas property that held the title
of the world's largest hotel _ the 3,530-room Flamingo Hilton.
   Tuesday's opening will give Circus Circus a total of 11,320
rooms in Nevada, with hotels in Las Vegas, Reno and Laughlin. By
comparison, Atlantic City's 12 major hotels total 8,100 rooms.
   With the addition of the Excalibur, Las Vegas now has 75,000
hotel rooms.

<HEAD>Oil Slick Stalls in Gulf, Volunteers Maintain Tar Ball Vigil at
Beaches</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA TOLLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>GALVESTON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 30-mile oil slick from the wrecked
supertanker Mega Borg lingered 10 miles off the Texas coast
Tuesday, and the Coast Guard backed off predictions of where or
when it might reach land.
   ``I think predicting anything at this time is probably very
premature,'' said Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Frank Whipple. Coast Guard
officials had predicted that it would float ashore near Galveston
on Tuesday.
   ``I think what's very good news is the fact that it's not coming
closer to the beach right now; it's staying offshore,'' Whipple
said. ``That allows more evaporation, allows the contractors more
time to pick the oil out of the water. We've been trying all along
to remove as much of it from the water before it got to the beach.''
   Whipple said crews have recovered 463,000 gallons of an oil and
water mixture skimmed from the Gulf of Mexico.
   The spill of 3.9 million gallons of the 38 million gallons of
oil aboard the Mega Borg followed a June 8 explosion aboard the
supertanker about 57 miles from Galveston.
   Most of the oil spilled has burned off, evaporated or been
collected. Coast Guard officials have been hesitant to say just how
much oil remains in the slick and sheen.
   ``We're kind of staying away from those figures,'' Chief Warrant
Office Rick Meidt said. ``We've already picked up something like
five times more oil than we thought was in the water. But, I should
point out, what we're picking up is an oily water mixture that is
about 20 percent oil and 80 percent water.''
   Coast Guard officials said the slick could come ashore closer to
High Island 30 miles northeast of Galveston, rather than Sea Rim
Park, which is further to the northeast.
   ``That's good news,'' said Petty Officer Mark Sedwick. ``That
means it will be away from the marsh areas where we were concerned
about the wildlife.''
   About 1,200 volunteers from five counties were on alert to clean
up beaches should the tar balls arrive.
   State officials also wrapped up tests on oil-eating bacteria
that was poured into the oil during the weekend.
   ``We've got some good samples,'' said Blanton Moore of the Texas
General Land Office. ``We know some change occurred, but what that
change is we don't really know until we run some lab samples.''
   The Mexican skimmer Ecopemex and 10 other skimmers continued to
skim oil off the water. Booms and other deflector devices have been
deployed to protect the shoreline.
   Two crew members died in the explosion, and two others are
missing and presumed dead.

<HEAD>Rebel Leader Says Insurgents Demanding Exile of Liberia President</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Liberia-Victims, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of the rebel delegation
to Liberian peace talks has denied accepting a cease-fire and said
the insurgents continue to demand the exile of President Samuel Doe.
   Thomas Woewiyu, interviewed Monday night, also spurned Doe's
offer of a general amnesty that would permit the insurgents in
Liberia to set up their own political party.
   Doe on Monday legalized several opposition political parties and
said the National Patriotic Front could set up a party without fear
of reprisals.
   ``Doe has no authority to grant anybody amnesty. He is not in a
position to grant amnesty. He can only grant himself amnesty,''
said Woewiyu.
   He added, ``Our ultimate leader (Charles Taylor) controls the
military machine and whatever Doe says will not stop our military
leader's military planning.''
   The rebel delegation signed an agreement calling for both sides
to exercise restraint during the recess in the talks.
   Fighting had virtually ceased before the talks began after
government forces inflicted their first major defeat on the rebels
since Taylor's forces invaded from neighboring Ivory Coast on Dec.
24.
   The rebels were driven from the Firestone rubber plantation and
neighboring international airport 35 miles from Monrovia after
their chief military commander, Elmer Johnson, a former Boston area
resident, was killed in a skirmish.
   Woewiyu said the agreement ``applies more to Doe's extramilitary
activities, his death squads chopping off people's heads and
throwing away their bodies. That has nothing to do with a
cease-fire.''
   Survivors who have fled rebel-controlled territory say the
insurgents also committed atrocities. Reporters who have visited
them saw the skulls of dead Liberian soldiers stuck on stakes along
the roadside.
   ``The reason for the recess is for further consultation. We have
an unnegotiable precondition to be met and Doe's people at the
peace talks were not in a position to discuss the subject of Doe's
departure from government.
   ``It is Doe who needs an amnesty and he better take it now
before it is too late.''
   Woewiyu said the rebels accepted the recess to give Doe time to
flee.
   The talks, mediated by the Liberian Council of Churches, are
scheduled to resume June 25.

<HEAD>Kidnapped American's Employer Says Abductors are Guerrillas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MONTE HAYES_</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer_</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>QUITO, Ecuador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The employer of a young American kidnapped
in the Ecuadoran jungle said Tuesday he believed the abductors were
guerrillas from neighboring Colombia.
   Jeffrey Fino, general manager of IMINCO, the small gold mining
enterprise that employed Scott Heimdal, said a Peoria, Ill.,
television station was mistaken in reporting a former contractor
had orchestrated Heimdal's kidnapping.
   Fino said a legal complaint filed by the company against the
contractor has been misinterpreted by the news media.
   ``This is an old document and an old action that the company
filed against a contractor'' Fino said.
   ``He supplied us with information that there may be a
kidnapping. We don't know where that information came from. That's
the only thing that ties him to the kidnapping. I can't say he
collaborated with the kidnappers,'' he said.
   Fino described the contractor as an Ecuadoran who had become a
naturalized U.S. citizen.
   The man mentioned in the civil and criminal complaint filed by
IMINCO on May 1 had a contract with the company to transport mining
equipment to the jungle area where IMINCO was searching for gold,
Fino said.
   The Associated Press obtained a copy of the document Tuesday.
   The complaint accuses the man of attempting to extort $48,000
from Fino in return for not harassing him with legal actions
against the mining enterprise.
   The document also says he told the company he had information
that Fino might be kidnapped or killed.
   The complaint asks the police to investigate the contractor's
``possible complicity or cover-up of the crimes of kidnapping,
assassination and ... attempted extortion.''
   But Fino said Tuesday he believed Heimdal's kidnappers were
Colombian guerrillas.
   ``According to communications from Scott and other evidence, we
feel the kidnappers are Colombian guerrillas,'' he said.
   The armed men who seized Heimdal April 28 as he traveled along
the Bermeja River near the Colombian border identified themselves
as members of the People's Liberation Army, a Communist guerrilla
group in Colombia. The kidnappers killed the boat's driver in the
attack.
   In an interview last week with The AP, Fino showed photos taken
of Heimdal in the guerrilla camp. The rebels wore camouflage
uniforms and had automatic weapons.
   Fino, who has been closely involved in negotiations to win
Heimdal's freedom, said the kidnappers have behaved erratically in
their meetings with his go-between.
   Heimdal's parents, Roy and Marge Heimdal of Peoria, arrived in
Quito Monday night to try to win their son's release. They refused
to talk to reporters.
   The Heimdals, a working-class family, gathered $60,000 in
community donations to pay ransom for their son's release. But they
learned last week they had been mistaken and the kidnappers had all
along demanded $612,000 _ that the $60,000 was only to
``guarantee'' they wouldn't kill Heimdal.
   ``It looks like I'm going to have to go and get him out,'' Mrs.
Heimdal told the Peoria Journal Star this weekend. ``I'm tired of
just sitting and doing nothing about all this.''
   U.S. Embassy officials have said they are concerned that the
wide publicity the kidnapping has received may complicate
negotiations to win Heimdal's release and could endanger his life.

   President Bush urged a group of outdoor
enthusiasts Tuesday night to pressure Congress for funds to plant a
billion trees a year.
   ``Take this message with you, please, to the legislative
branch,'' Bush said. ``Don't leave our tree-planting initiative out
on a limb.''
   Bush made the remarks at a black-tie dinner where he was honored
as an outdoorsman. He received the Sheldon Coleman Great Outdoors
Award, named for the man whose name is emblazoned on camping
equipment.
   He joked that his award should have gone ``to a more
accomplished outdoors person. It probably should have gone to the
only person I know who can fish and read at the same time _ Barbara
Bush.''
   Reflecting on time in the outdoors, Bush said, ``these are
special moments ... very, very special. So, preserving nature for
future generations demands special effort.''
   The president has asked Congress for $175 million for the first
year of a multi-year initiative to plant a billion trees and launch
a community program to plant another 30 million trees.
   ``I've seen too many budgets frittered away on other
priorities,'' the president said. ``We all agree that trees are
good for our water, good for our air, good for our communities.''

   Libya's official news agency said the country's
leader, Moammar Gadhafi, did not call on Arab scientists to develop
an atomic bomb and accused the West of distorting Gadhafi's weekend
speech.
   ``The leader of the revolution asserted America had prevented
Libyan students from studying space and the atom,'' the British
Broadcasting Corp. monitors quoted the JANA news agency as saying
in an English-language commentary. In Libya, Gadhafi is referred to
as ``the leader of the revolution.''
   ``America is hostile to Arab and to Libyans. It bars them from
studying sciences and from reaching technical standards. ... The
Israelis had made more than one nuclear rocket aimed at every Arab
city. America is sending above our heads artificial satellites and
this is provoking us,'' JANA added.
   JANA said there was ``no hinting at any atomic bomb or
missiles'' in the speech.
   On Sunday, the BBC monitors quoted Gadhafi as exhorting students
to ``intensify efforts to reach space and manufacture the atom in
defiance of America.''

<TEXT>
   An army of police, 100 tow trucks, 150 miles of
ticker tape, hawkers of $15 T-shirts and every last dog in the bomb
squad _ all were ready for Nelson Mandela's arrival Wednesday in
the United States.
   No one seemed readier than the man who will put Mandela up for
three nights, Mayor David Dinkins.
   Speaking Tuesday at a national mayors' meeting in Chicago, New
York's first black mayor said that Mandela comes to America ``as a
transcendent symbol of freedom, and as a solitary person who is
altering world history.''
   He also promised to alter life in New York, accustomed though
the city is to gridlock-wreaking visitors.
   A security effort, code named ``Operation Topaz,'' enlisted
thousands of city police officers and federal and state agents in
an attempt to make sure the first visit to an American city by the
leader of the African National Congress is a safe one.
   A key weapon was what police call the ``Mandelamobile,'' a
flatbed truck outfitted with a bulletproof glass bubble large
enough for Mandela and several others.
   There are concerns about the health of the 71-year-old Mandela,
whose 27 years in a South African prison included stretches of hard
labor. Ambulances will be stationed at cross streets along the
route, and the city's Emergency Medical Service has been given a
detailed medical history.
   Given the geographic breadth of his schedule and the police's
determination to keep his travel route clear, Mandela's visit was
expected to cause particular difficulties for motorists during the
next three days. ``This is more of a headache than when the
president comes,'' said Stephanie Pinto, a spokeswoman for the
Traffic Department.
   City workers had painted New York's official colors _ blue and
orange _ in a line down the middle of Broadway, filled potholes
along the route of Mandela's motorcade, and _ in a move that one
observer described as unprecedented _ washed the windows on City
Hall.
   Mandela, whose stop in New York is the first on a 12-day tour of
eight U.S. cities, will sleep at Gracie Mansion, the mayor's
residence. The place has only three bedrooms, which meant the
mayor's son David was evicted. Or, as his father put it, ``He's
been kind enough to relocate.''
   But is the maple, imitation-bamboo bed in the state bedroom big
enough for the 6-foot-4 Mandela? ``Our measurements say it will
work,'' insisted Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch.
   Mandela arrives Wednesday morning at Kennedy International
Airport and stops in Brooklyn to speak to a group of young people
before proceeding to Manhattan for a ticker-tape parade up lower
Broadway's concrete ``Canyon of Heros.''
   For an old-time flavor, the city imported genuine ticker tape.
About 150 miles of inch-wide paper ribbon was provided by a
Connecticut company that claims to be the nation's last ticker-tape
supplier. Computers have almost completely replaced tickers.
   The rest of Mandela's New York City visit has plenty of
contrast, ranging as it does from a street rally in Harlem on
Thursday to a $2,500-a-person reception on Friday night catered by
actor Robert De Niro's new Tribeca Grill.
   The latter is part of an effort to raise funds for Mandela's
African National Congress and the battle against apartheid in South
Africa. The tour's organizers also have licensed the sale of
various items, including a Mandela tour poster ($5), a ceramic cup
with Mandela's picture ($8) and a T-shirt bearing ``amandla,'' the
Zulu word for power, and Mandala's name ($15).
   This being New York, there were several developing controversies
amid the preparations.
   At Gracie Mansion on Tuesday evening, about 100 Jewish
protesters condemned Mandela's support for the Palestine Liberation
Organization while supporting his cause in South Africa.
   ``We ask our black brothers and sisters to understand our pain
in being here,'' said Rabbi Avi Weiss. ``Nelson Mandela is a hero
in the anti-apartheid struggle. We join as one in this struggle.''
   Weiss' group planned another demonstration for Wednesday near
City Hall, where Mandela is to receive the key to the city.
   Rock promoter Bill Graham pulled out as organizer of a concert
and rally scheduled for Thursday night at Yankee Stadium, citing
disagreements with city officials. They, in turn, blamed Graham's
failure to promote the event for poor ticket sales.
   About 20,000 of 45,000 tickets have been sold, and Graham has
been replaced by another well-known producer, Ron Delsener.

   A federal grand jury on Tuesday indicted the
retired head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's generic
drug division on two counts of perjury in a corruption scandal
involving the division.
   The indictment accuses Marvin Seife of lying to government
investigators about meetings with generic-drug company executives
and about whether he let them buy him meals, said U.S. Attorney
Breckinridge Willcox.
   Seife, who prosecutors said lives in San Antonio, did not have a
telephone listing in that area. His lawyer's name was not available.
   FDA spokeswoman Faye Peterson said the agency had not seen the
indictment and declined to comment.
   The indictment was the latest development in the investigation
into corruption in the generic-drug industry and among its
regulators, which began in the summer of 1988.
   So far, four of Seife's former subordinates have been convicted
on corruption and racketeering charges. Five generic-drug company
executives, three pharmaceutical companies and one industry
consultant have been convicted on similar charges.
   Seife, 66, retired Dec. 31 after 17 years as director of the
generic-drug division, where he was responsible for reviewing
manufacturers' applications to market generic drugs to the public.
   According to the indictment, Seife gave a sworn statement Oct.
25 to an FDA investigator in which he falsely denied meeting with
two generic-drug company executives on Dec. 11, 1987, to discuss
FDA matters.
   The indictment alleges that Seife made a similar false statement
July 11 to the House of Representatives' Subcommittee on Oversight
and Investigations.
   The second count of the indictment charges that Siefe also lied
in the statement to FDA investigators when he said, ``I have made
it a practice never to have meals with the regulated industry.''
The indictment alleges Seife accepted numerous lunches, dinners and
drinks paid for by generic-drug companies.
   If convicted on both counts, Seife faces a maximum of 10 years
in prison and a $500,000 fine.
   The case has been handled by federal prosecutors in Baltimore
because the FDA's headquarters are in Rockville.

   Nelson Mandela appealed to Canadian students
Tuesday to raise funds to help black youth in his South African
homeland who must deal with harsh police repression and an inferior
educational system.
   ``A reign of terror is being launched by the police,
specifically against students,'' the black nationalist leader told
about 1,000 teen-agers at a Toronto high school before flying to
Montreal, the last stop on his three-day Canadian visit.
   On Wednesday morning, he is to travel to New York to begin an
eight-city U.S. tour.
   ``I ask you, as students, to raise funds for the black students
in South Africa who are facing such enormous difficulty,'' said
Mandela, the deputy president of the African National Congress.
   Concluding his visit to Toronto at Central Technical School,
Mandela, 71, was flanked by his wife, Winnie, and External Affairs
Minister Joe Clark.
   His speech began more than an hour late because Mandela, who was
released in February after spending 27 years in prison for his
anti-apartheid activities, needed ``a little rest,'' a member of
his entourage told the crowd.
   The racially mixed audience at the inner-city school remained
upbeat as they waited, chanting ``Freedom power!'' and ``Viva
Mandela!''
   Mandela beamed and waved as the students gave him a standing
ovation.
   During his 20-minute speech, Mandela asked for the creation of
``a special fund'' to help black students in South Africa.
   They receive an education ``far inferior to whites,'' he said,
and those who have spoken out against the system ``have been
crushed with force'' by the white-minority government.
   ``They have arrested students who have protested. Others have
been crippled for life. They have confiscated their books. It's an
intolerable, brutal reign of terror.''
   Many black students have fled the country to seek an education,
depriving the black majority of future leaders, he said.
   Tony Silipo, chairman of the Toronto board of education, later
told the audience a nearby high school had already pledged some
money.
   While the students remained hushed during Mandela's appeal, they
cheered wildly when he grinned and joked with them.
   He mockingly worried that his many years in prison may have left
him ``old and ugly.
   ``Now, I want you to tell me if that is true?''
   ``No, no!'' came the response.
   Students leaving the school's auditorium said they were inspired
by Mandela's message. Many referred to racial tension in the city
following recent police shootings of blacks.
   ``He speaks for everyone, not just black people,'' said
Katherine Duncan, a black 12th grader.
   In Montreal, 20,000 people jammed into a square behind city hall
to listen to the South African leader, who appealed to Canadians to
maintain economic sanctions against South Africa.
   Prior to the address, Mandela visited Quebec's Premier Robert
Bourassa, who called Mandela ``a living symbol of freedom.''
   Mandela described as ``absolutely fantastic'' the reception he's
been given during his Canadian tour, which began Sunday in the
Canadian capital of Ottawa.
   ``It is for that reason that we admire you, that we respect you
and that we love you,'' he said.
   Mandela is in the midst of a six-week tour of 14 nations in
Africa, Europe and North America that began June 6.
   Mandela's release from prison was part of a program of social
reforms by the government of President F.W. de Klerk that included
legalizing the ANC and other anti-apartheid groups.
   De Klerk has also opened talks with black groups on giving a
political voice to the country's 28 million blacks. South Africa's
five million whites control the government and economy.

   Florida needs more regulatory
powers to control ``outlaws'' and ``pirates'' who provide
abortions, a prosecutor argued Tuesday as the state tested the
limits of a federal injunction.
   The state Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services has
proposed new rules to regulate abortion clinics.
   But any change would have to be approved by U.S. District Judge
Jose Gonzalez, who rejected similar efforts with the injunction in
1982.
   State Assistant Attorney General James Peters argued Tuesday
that new rules are warranted, citing a U.S. Supreme Court decision
last summer and the potential for AIDS transmission in unsanitary
clinics.
   But Charlene Carres, representing Florida clinics which filed a
class-action lawsuit opposing the state's effort to revise the
injunction, said existing regulations are sufficient and that
attempts to go further would violate a patient's right to privacy
and drive up the average $300 cost of an abortion.
   It is ``the exceptions in the industry _ outlaws, pirates or
whatever _ who need this type of protection,'' Peters said. ``What
happens here, judge, is that we are frozen. We are standing on our
own tail.''
   Carres, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer, countered that
no new rules are justified and noted that the state's own
statistics show first-trimester abortions to be much safer than
childbirth.
   Gonzalez promised to rule within a month.
   In 1982, Gonzalez ruled the state could check on licenses,
records and disposal of fetal remains and make sure only physicians
perform abortions.
   Placed off limits to government regulators were staffing,
equipment, medical-care standards and transportation of patients
during emergencies.
   The state claims it is entitled to re-enter those areas, in part
because of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in July that upheld a
Missouri law requiring viability tests for fetuses after 20 weeks.
   That decision was the first limit backed by the nation's high
court since abortion was legalized in 1973.
   Florida's latest move asks Gonzalez to revise his injunction so
clinics can be further regulated.
   The state cited ``intolerable conditions'' found at south
Florida clinics last fall after The Miami Herald detailed
bloodstained wrappings and leaking oxygen tanks at one clinic.
   Gov. Bob Martinez, a vocal opponent of abortion, has repeatedly
tried unsuccessfully to control abortions in Florida through
legislative, administrative and judicial means.
   The state Supreme Court threw out a parental consent law in
October. Days later, the Legislature adjourned a special session on
abortion regulations without passing a single bill. And state
regulators say snap inspections of abortion clinics last fall
failed to correct problems.
   The attorney general's office says it is trying to guarantee
abortions under safe medical conditions.
   But abortion rights advocates claim the state is trying to
impose harsher rules than are required for comparable procedures
like vasectomies.

<HEAD>Five European Countries Sign Accord to End Border Checks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT J. WIELAARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SCHENGEN, Luxembourg (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five EC nations on Tuesday signed an
accord under which they will end border checks for their nationals,
apply a joint visa and asylum policy and share data on illegal
aliens, suspected criminals and missing persons.
   The long-awaited accord between Belgium, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, France and West Germany was hailed as an example for a
no-borders pact among all 12 European Community nations.
   ``Our agreement is a model ... for the free movement of people
in the Community,'' Dutch Deputy Foreign Minister Piet Dankert told
reporters on behalf of the signatory nations.
   Yet he doubted all 12 EC nations were ready to remove their
borders after Dec. 31, 1992, under the EC's single-market scheme.
The 12 EC states have not even found unanimity for an accord on
handling of asylum-seekers in the EC.
   The five-nation pact will be extended to include East Germany
after its expected merger this year with the Federal Republic,
making it the first international treaty viewing East and West
Germany as a single entity.
   Negotiations are to open this week with Italy, which wants to
join the Schengen accord, named for this village on the
Luxembourg-German-French border where it was signed.
   The accord, in the works since 1985, must be ratified by the
national parliaments to take effect. Ratification may take two
years.
   Under the accord, the five signatory nations will:
   _Remove internal border checks for their citizens and legal
residents and let legally admitted people from outside the five
nations move within their boundaries for three months without a
visa.
   _Apply a joint policy to prevent ``asylum shopping,'' whereby
refugees go from one nation to the next to get residency visas.
   _Intensify cooperation between police and justice officials and
allow police to chase suspected criminals across national
boundaries.
   _Simplify extradition procedures and harmonize gun-control
legislation.
   _Share information on people wanted or missing or who are
considered dangerous. Such a databank will also keep tabs on such
items as stolen cars and passports.
   The Schenger agreement primarily benefits passenger traffic. On
road transport, the five EC nations pledged to keep border checks
``at the lowest possible level'' by removing some of the red tape
that hampers road transporters.
   The agreement allows any state to revert to full-fledged border
checks on national security grounds.
   Reflecting the sensitive nature of dropping border controls,
Tuesday's signing ceremony was three years behind schedule.
   In past negotiations, the issue has encountered several hurdles,
ranging from Luxembourg's refusal to water-down its bank secrecy
laws to concerns elsewhere that the computer databank may lead to
an invasion of privacy.

   Police released dramatic tapes on
Tuesday of terrified office workers pleading for help from police
as a gunman roamed through the building and shots rang out in the
background.
   ``We're being killed!'' whispered a General Motors Acceptance
Corp. employee as James Edward ``Pop'' Pough methodically made his
way through the auto loan office. ``Send the, send the SWAT team
now!''
   `` ... He's killing everyone,'' another panicked caller
whispered as the workers waited for police to arrive.
   In the tape recordings of calls to the police 911 hot line, the
callers' voices reflected the terror of the situation as the gunman
fired under desks, killing eight and wounding five others before
turning the gun on himself.
   ``He's still in there shooting ... shooting everybody! Come
on!'' implored Barry Kimbal, an employee who ran to a neighboring
business to call for help.
   As police were dispatched, emergency operators asked workers for
a description of the gunman, his shirt color and what kind of car
he was driving as rapid firing could be heard over the phone.
   ``All I know is he came in and starting shooting,'' said another
panicky voice.
   Authorities said the 42-year-old Pough _ who had a violent past,
a failing marriage and an arsenal of deadly weapons _ entered the
office Monday morning, and blazed away with a clip-loaded
.30-caliber carbine.
   In just a few minutes, seven employees and a customer died; five
other people were critically wounded.
   The gunman then killed himself with a .38-caliber revolver.
   Authorities could suggest no motive other than that Pough had a
1988 Grand Am repossessed by GMAC. The last time GMAC had contact
with Pough was in March, when they mailed him a letter telling him
he still owed money, GMAC President William Lovejoy said.
   The families of the eight dead, still in shock, were planning
funerals and mourning the loss of their loved ones.
   ``What a waste. What a damned waste,'' said victim Janice
David's husband, Ray David, tears on his cheeks and the couple's
son in his lap.
   ``I feel depressed. I feel cheated,'' said victim Cynthia
Perry's mother, Gail Perry. ``She was a joy to everyone.''
   Mayor Tommy Hazouri called the shootings ``the darkest moment in
Jacksonville history.''
   Police said Pough had shot and killed a man and a woman Sunday
morning in a prostitution-related dispute. Police confirmed Tuesday
that he shot and wounded two teen-agers about 10 minutes later.
   Ballistics tests completed Tuesday confirmed that the rifle used
in the GMAC killings was the same gun used in the Sunday shootings,
Sheriff Jim McMillan said. Pough also had a 9mm machine pistol
which authorities found in his car.
   ``We will be following up today and talking to his relatives to
see if anything happened that might have caused this or if he gave
any kind of indication,'' police spokesman Asa Higgs said Tuesday.
   Questions surfaced about Pough's background and how he could buy
a handgun after pleading guilty to an aggravated assault charge in
which he shot and killed another man in 1971.
   Duval County Circuit Judge Warren Jones withheld a guilty
verdict, pending completion of five years' probation with the
condition that Pough not own a weapon.
   When Pough completed his probation, that condition was lifted,
Chief Assistant State Attorney John Delaney said Tuesday.
   ``He was not technically a convicted felon,'' Delaney said.
   That made it legal to own a gun under Florida law.
   But McMillan said it was illegal for him to own a gun under
federal law. ``It's a loophole we need to plug up,'' the sheriff
said.
   The prosecutor couldn't give the details on the 1971 crime or
why the charge was reduced from manslaughter, because the file has
been destroyed.
   In 1968, Pough was fined $75 for displaying a knife in a
threatening manner, and an arrest warrant was outstanding in a 1982
unemployment compensation fraud case, according to court records.
   Pough, who was separated from his wife, lived in a run-down
duplex in Jacksonville's predominantly black Northwest Quadrant.
   Neighbors described him as quiet, pleasant and helpful. But in
March, a circuit judge granted Pough's wife, Theresa, an injunction
to keep him away. The protective order prohibited Pough from
communicating with her, and meant he had to stay away from where
she worked and lived.
   For the last year, Pough had been doing maintenance work for the
W. W. Gay Construction Co. at the Anheuser-Busch brewery.
   A team of GMAC officials led by Lovejoy flew into Jacksonville
to counsel victims and their families and to set up a temporary
office to handle GMAC business.
   ``The first step for us is the mental health of our employees,''
said Lovejoy, who announced that GMAC was establishing an
assistance fund for the families of those killed or wounded.
   The company is contributing $100,000, and Lovejoy said it would
solicit donations from other General Motors employees.
   The victims were identified as Drew Woods, 38; Denise Highfill,
36; Sharon Louise Hall, 45; Barbara Duckwall Holland, 45; Lee
Simonton, 33; customer Julia White Burgess, 42; Mrs. David, 40; and
Ms. Perry, 30.
   The wounded were Ron Ecchevaria, 49; Jewel Belote, 50; Nancy
Dill, 31; Phyllis Griggs, 42, and David Hendrix, 25.
   Ecchevaria's condition has been upgraded from serious to fair
and Ms. Belote is listed in serious but stable condition, both at
University Medical Kenter. At Baptist Hospital, Ms. Griggs is in
stable but serious condition, Dill is in very serious condition and
Hendrix is critical but stable.

<HEAD>Irish Politicians Return from Hostage Talks in Tehran</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Three Irish politicians returned home
Tuesday from hostage talks in Iran, and said conciliatory gestures
by the United States and Israel could help win the release of
Western hostages in Lebanon.
   The three said they discussed the fate of Irish teacher Brian
Keenan and the other 15 Western hostages believed held by
pro-Iranian Shiite extremists in Lebanon.
   ``We discussed all the hostages, both those (Westerners) being
held in Lebanon and the Islamic hostages held by the Israelis,''
Niall Andrews, a representative of Irish Prime Minister Charles
Haughey's Fianna Fail party in the European Parliament, told
reporters at Dublin airport.
   ``The Iranians are not looking for ransom, or for money. They
are looking for peace and a proper humanitarian settlement to the
hostage problem,'' he said.
   ``The Iranians seemed to have the impression that if there was
reciprocation on the side of the Israelis and the Americans, they
could bring about very easily and very quickly a resolution to the
hostage situation on all sides.''
   Andrews' brother, David Andrews, a Fianna Fail representative in
the Irish Parliament, said Iranian officials wanted the United
States to reciprocate for Iran's role in helping obtain the release
in April of two American hostages, Robert Polhill and Frank Reed.
   The Andrews brothers said their visit to Tehran with Irish
senator Eoin Ryan was privately organized and not sponsored by the
government or any other organization.
   The three said they planned to brief Haughey on their talks and
report to Keenan's family on the latest moves to obtain his release.
   David Andrews said he suggested to Iranian officials that
members of the Keenan family might meet in Tehran or Dublin with
families of Iranians held in the Middle East. He said the Iranian
officials promised to consider the proposal.
   The three politicians did not name the Iranian officials with
whom they met.
   Keenan, 39, from Belfast in Northern Ireland, holds dual Irish
and British citizenship. He was working as an English language
teacher at the American University of Beirut when he disappeared
while walking to work April 11, 1986.
   The longest held hostage is American Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, seized by
gunmen near his home in west Beirut on March 16, 1985.
   The most prominent prisoner Israel holds is Sheikh Abdul-Karim
Obeid, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem cleric captured in July 1989.
   Israel holds more than 5,000 Palestinians detained during the
2{-year-old Arab uprising against Israeli occupation of the Gaza
Strip and West Bank.
   In addition, more than 300 Arab prisoners, mostly Shiite
Moslems, are held by the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army at
al-Khiam just north of the Israeli-Lebanese border.
   Israel has said it would free some of its Arab prisoners in
exchange for the release of three Israelis held by Shiites in
Lebanon.

   A freight train rammed a tanker truck
loaded with alcohol Tuesday, touching off a fireball that engulfed
the front of the train and killing three of the freight's crew
members, authorities said.
   ``I would say they suffocated from the fire, but I can't prove
that,'' said fire Capt. Lester Blaylock.
   The tanker exploded on impact and the CSX Corp. train continued
for several hundred yards, trailing flames and leaving burning
puddles in this western Tennessee city, Blaylock said.
   Killed were the train's engineer, reserve engineer and head
brakeman, said a CSX spokesman. Their names were withheld until
relatives could be notified.
   The truck driver, John Gilboy, 25, of New Jersey, was treated
for minor injuries at a hospital and released, said Police Chief
Lucion English.
   Gilboy was issued a misdemeanor citation for failing to stop at
a railroad crossing, said Sgt. Leon King of the state Public
Service Commission, which oversees the trucking industry.
   Eleven firefighters were overcome by heat and fumes. Employees
of several small businesses near the tracks left the area until the
fire was brought under control about 30 minutes after the 8:05 a.m.
crash, said Ed Ellington of the Haywood County Emergency Management
Agency.
   No other injuries were reported.
   City police dispatcher Patsy Crutchfield said the front of the
train was destroyed, but did not know how many of its 50 to 75 cars
were affected. The flames did not spread beyond the train and truck.
   The accident occurred in an industrial area on the east side of
town, where a farmer's cooperative, several factories and other
businesses are located.
   English said the crash was being investigated by local, state
and federal officials.
   Warning lights at the crossing apparently were working at the
time of the crash, said Ellington.
   ``From all reports, the truck driver just crossed the track and
the train struck the tank of the trailer he was pulling,''
Ellington said. ``Apparently he didn't see the signal or
something.''
   The tanker was owned by Linden Bulk Transports of New Jersey,
and was loaded with ethylhexanol, an industrial alcohol, he said.
   Cleanup crews mopped up several small spills but most of the
tanker's cargo burned away, he said.
   The train had been headed to Memphis from Nashville.
   The crossing was cleared by late afternoon.
   Brownsville is 40 miles northeast of Memphis.

   A judge ruled Tuesday that an art gallery and
its director must stand trial on at least one charge stemming from
an exhibit of sexually graphic photos by Robert Mapplethorpe.
   ``This court will try to make a decision of what, in Ohio,
constitutes the definition of obscenity,'' Hamilton County
Municipal Judge David Albanese said. ``It has been an awesome
judicial effort in the past and will continue to be so.
   ``Obscene material is not protected by the First Amendment. This
case is not about the rights of the curious to view an exhibition.''
   Albanese rejected several defense motions to dismiss two
misdemeanor charges against the Contemporary Arts Center and its
director, Dennis Barrie.
   The first charge, set for trial Sept. 24, involves photographs
of two children. In one, a boy's genitals are exposed; in the
other, a girl's genitals are exposed. The arts center and Barrie
were charged with illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented
material or performance.
   The second charge, pandering obscenity, involves five photos
showing homosexual acts. Albanese said he wanted an evidentiary
hearing on that charge before ruling whether it should go to trial.
He scheduled the hearing for Aug. 20.
   The exhibit ``Robert Mapplethorpe: A Perfect Moment,'' included
175 photographs. The defense contends all of them should be
considered in determining whether the entire exhibit is obscene.
Prosecutors want the judge to consider only the five photos.
   ``This court is not presumptuous enough to believe that it has
the background and information necessary to try to rationalize
whether these pictures can be taken as a whole or independently,''
Albanese said.
   According to court records, the photos cited in the indictment
included pictures showing a hand and other objects inserted into
anuses.
   If convicted, Barrie could be sentenced to six months in jail
and be fined $1,000 on each charge. The arts center could be fined
$5,000 on each charge.
   In his ruling, Albanese said he considered the arts center to be
a gallery rather than a museum, and noted that a museum is
permitted more latitude in displaying art.
   A county grand jury indicted the art gallery and Barrie on April
7 after secretly attending the public opening of the exhibit that
day. According to art gallery figures, the exhibit drew 80,000
people during its seven-week run.
   One of the defense motions rejected by Albanese alleged that
prosecutors improperly sought a biased judge to issue a search
warrant allowing them to enter the art gallery to videotape the
exhibit.
   ``This court believes that any judge on the Hamilton County
Municipal Court at any time, under the proper procedures, can and
should authorize the issuance of a search warrant; `judge shopping'
simply does not exist in this cause,'' Albanese wrote.
   He noted that the indictments were returned before the search
warrant was obtained.

<HEAD>NBC President Calls FCC Rules Reverse Protectionism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC's president assailed federal syndication
and financial interest rules Tuesday as ``reverse protectionism''
that favors foreign-owned media conglomerates and hurts the three
major U.S. networks.
   The assertion by Robert C. Wright, made at a speech at the
Center for National Policy, came less than a week after NBC, CBS
and ABC urged the Federal Communications Commission to drop its
20-year-old rules.
   Their action came after they and Hollywood producers and studios
failed to reach a compromise last week on ways to alter the rules,
which the FCC originally adopted as a means of curbing network
power.
   Wright said the rules are outdated due to changes in television,
including the growth of cable, the establishment of 300 new
independent stations, the 4-year-old Fox network and home
videocassette recorders.
   The rules ``have fostered concentration and inhibited
competition in the 20 years since they were adopted,'' he said,
adding that they ``constitute nothing less than reverse
protectionism.
   ``They are domestic trade barriers aimed only at three U.S.
companies, but which leave our foreign competitors alone. Even more
absurd, the rules restrict us from competing against the foreign
studios in the foreign markets...
   ``Can anyone imagine Japan giving NBC or Time Warner access to
its markets while at the same time restricting Sony?''
   The FCC rules bar the networks from a financial interest in
shows they don't wholly own, and prohibit them from doing business
in the lucrative program syndication market in the U.S.
   The producers and the studio have asked the FCC to strengthen
the rules, and investigate the networks for possible violations of
them. The Justice Department has sided with the networks' position.
   The Center for National Policy is a policy institute involved in
trade and related issues, according to a corporate press release
from NBC.

   Former dictator Anastasio Somoza's
family will be allowed to return to Nicaragua under a recent
amnesty declared by President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro's new
government, a presidential spokesman said Tuesday.
   A niece and nephew of Somoza, exiled since his overthrow by the
leftist Sandinistas in July 1979, said they were flying to Managua,
the capital, Saturday to become the first members of the old ruling
family to return to Nicaragua.
   Presidential spokesman Antonio Lacayo said the government ``knew
absolutely nothing'' about the planned arrival of Luis and Julia
Sevilla Somoza.
   But he said, ``All Nicaraguans can come back and begin a new
life if they want to under the new law.''
   Mrs. Chamorro's U.S.-backed administration, which took power
after defeating the Sandinistas in February's elections, decreed an
unconditional amnesty on May 10 ``for all the political and related
common crimes committed by Nicaraguan citizens up to the date of
publication of the current law.''
   A previous amnesty for political offenders declared by the
Sandinistas only covered crimes committed after the fall of Somoza,
leaving his family unprotected.
   Luis Sevilla Somoza, one of about 100 Somoza family members
living in exile in the United States and Europe, said he and his
sister Julia planned to spend a week in Managua, meeting with
ministers of Chamorro's government and Cardinal Miguel Obando y
Bravo.
   Sevilla Somoza said he wanted to explore ways to help rebuild
the country and investment opportunities during his upcoming trip.
   ``Basically it's a trip to see what's going on and find out how
we can help the government and the church,'' he said.
   Lacayo was cautious in commenting about the intentions of the
Sevilla Somozas.
   ``Although they are covered by the broad amnesty declared, their
coming to work with the government or recover property is another
thing,'' Lacayo said. The Sandinistas confiscated Somoza family
holdings after the revolution that brought the guerrilla movement
to power.
   About a half-million Nicaraguans, or 17 percent of the country's
citizens, are living abroad.
   Thousands fled immediately following Somoza's ouster, and many
more abandoned their homeland during the Sandinista's rule to
escape hard times caused by U.S.-backed economic sanctions and the
civil war with Contra rebels.
   Since Mrs. Chamorro's election visit, the United States has
restored normal economic relations with Nicaragua and the Contras
have mostly demobilized as part of a peace plan. But the economy
has continued to worsen, with the new administration devaluing the
currency 11 times in less than two months.
   Despite the amnesty, few Nicaraguans have returned home from
abroad.
   The 1978 assassination of Mrs. Chamorro's husband, La Prensa
newspaper publisher Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, was one of the events
that sparked the overthrow of Anastasio Somoza by the Sandinistas.
Mrs. Chamorro later broke with the Sandinistas over their leftist
policies.
   Anastasio Somoza fled to Paraguay, where he was assassinated on
an Asuncion street by bazooka-wielding assailants in 1980.
   Sevilla Somoza said his family believes that the sore feelings
have subsided and it is safe for them to return to Nicaragua.
   ``We were never in the government, in politics or the army,'' he
said. ``We are good people with much to offer.''

   A second group of amateur astronomers will be
given a chance to use the Hubble Space Telescope, the telescope's
operators announced Tuesday.
   They said an earlier offer to amateurs was such a success that
they decided to do it again.
   ``I think it shows we were so pleased with the types of
proposals, the imagination, creativity and thought that went into
the first ones that it justified doing it again,'' said Ray
Villard, a spokesman for the Space Telescope Science Institute at
Johns Hopkins University.
   The Hubble Space Telescope was launched into orbit April 25
aboard the space shuttle Discovery. Free from the distorting
effects of Earth's atmosphere, the $1.5 billion telescope is
designed to study the furthest reaches of the universe.
   Five amateur astronomers were chosen from hundreds of
applications the first time. They have been allocated 17 hours of
telescope time, about 1 percent of the time granted to
professionals, Villard said.
   The number of applicants in the second group and the amount of
time they will be given has not been decided, he said.
   ``I would expect it would be comparable,'' Villard said. ``It
might not sound like a lot, but considering the competition there
really is a lot of science that could be done with that much time.''
   The group of five astronomers chosen the first time will be
allowed to use the Hubble telescope in 1991. The next group will be
given access in 1992, Villard said.
   ``It's the opportunity of a lifetime. Not for professionals, but
for the average person,'' said John Hewitt, one of the first five
amateurs selected. ``The program is very unique. As far as I know,
no other observatory director has in a sense opened the door like
this.''
   After a rigorous selection process, the finalists are flown to
Baltimore to work with institute scientists and technicians to
refine their observing requirements and are then scheduled along
with professional programs. The amateurs are invited back to the
institute to observe the incoming data and use the institute's
computers to analyze it.
   ``Frankly, astronomy is one of the areas where an everyday
person can do some exploration and discover something and make a
meaningful contribution,'' Villard said.
   Several of the proposals made by the original five astronomers
are unique applications of the telescope that had not been proposed
by professional astronomers, he said.
   Ana Larson of Seattle plans to look for planets being formed
around stars by using the telescope's infrared capabilities.
Planets being formed, known as protoplanets, are brighter than
normal planets in the infrared range while condensing, Villard said.
   Hewitt, a science museum educator in Berkeley, Calif., has
access to the telescope as soon as the next star is observed going
nova. Hewitt plans to use the light generated by the nova to
discover literally billions of comets that astronomers believe may
surround stars.
   ``The whole idea is an amateur at home might just come up with
something creative and different, yet scientifically feasible,''
Villard said. ``They might approach a scientific question from a
different angle.''

   A federal judge on Tuesday ordered the small-town
bank that has been holding a cache of stolen medieval art to open
its vault for inventory by the East German cathedral that claims
the treasure.
   U.S. District Judge Sidney A. Fitzwater also ordered that the
time and place of the inspection be kept secret to protect the
inspectors and the objects.
   The art is believed to have been stolen from a German mine shaft
at the end of World War II by a U.S. soldier from Texas. German art
experts have said the treasures are worth millions of dollars, but
no specific estimate is available.
   The president of a First National Bank branch in the town of
Whitewright said he never knew the art had been stolen and has been
trying to mediate the dispute over its ownership.
   ``We wanted to do what was right,'' branch President John Farley
said in an interview published Tuesday in The Denison Herald.
   The Lutheran cathedral in Quedlinburg, East Germany, is suing to
recover the artwork from First National and the family of Joe T.
Meador, a former Army first lieutenant who is believed to have
stolen the objects and stashed them in his hometown of Whitewright,
about 60 miles north of Dallas.
   The treasure disappeared in 1945 from a mine shaft in
Quedlinburg, a castle town occupied by U.S. troops at the end of
World War II.
   Meador died of cancer in 1980, and his family put the objects in
the bank for safekeeping, Farley said. He oversees the Whitewright
branch but is based at Denison, about 70 miles north of Dallas.
   Farley told The Associated Press the bank will ask to be dropped
from the lawsuit because First National never claimed to own the
relics. He declined to answer further questions about the case.
   A church representative met with Farley on May 7 to demand
return of the treasures. The lawsuit alleges at least 14 objects
were taken by Meador, including a silver, ivory and gold reliquary
from the 9th or 10th century, a 10th century Byzantine rock-crystal
flask with sides shaped like birds and an ivory comb inlaid with
precious stones.
   Farley and his attorney, Timothy Powers, told The Denison Herald
the bank had been negotiating with the church and the Meador family.
   The talks broke down last week when the story broke and
international attention focused on the bank and Whitewright,
population 1,760, Farley said.
   He said keeping the treasures did not affect the bank's daily
business or financial status.
   ``We're on the sidelines,'' he said. ``I'm sorry that we were
not able to get the parties to agree. It's not in anyone's best
interest to incur litigation costs.''
   Fitzwater revised his inventory order Tuesday after conference
calls with attorneys on both sides of the dispute.
   He also ruled on a defense request that had been informally made
Tuesday, but his office declined to reveal the nature of the
decision or the request until the request is formally filed with
the court Wednesday.
   Fitzwater dictated the circumstances of the inventory down to
the placement of cameras and a requirement that all inspectors wear
cotton gloves.
   Attorneys for the defendants did not return phone calls seeking
comment.
   Meador's brother and sister, Jack Meador of Whitewright and Jane
Meador Cook of Mesquite, have declined to comment.
   Government officials have said it is unclear whether criminal
charges could be brought in the case because of statutes of
limitations on thefts of art and antiquities.
   Ely Maurer, a State Department assistant legal adviser for
cultural property, said criminal charges might be pursued under the
National Stolen Property Act. The law prohibits interstate or
international transport of stolen art or artifacts.
   The law might be extended to heirs if they knew the art was
stolen and transferred it across state lines, Maurer said.

<HEAD>Tyrannosaurus Skeleton Emerging From Montana Badlands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JORDAN, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The largest carnivore ever to roam the
Earth is emerging from the badlands of eastern Montana _ after
being buried for 65 million years.
   A museum crew's careful digging has uncovered most of an intact
skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus rex, only the eighth ever found. The
remains exposed so far include the skull, tail, pelvis area, arm
and back.
   The lower arm bones are the first ever found for any T-rex.
   The Tyrannosaurus is perhaps the most fabled of all dinosaurs
because of its size _ nearly 35 to 40 feet long and up to 12 feet
high _ and its meat-eating diet.
   ``If you like ferocity ... ferocious things, the T-rex has got
to be at the top of the list,'' said Jack Horner of the Museum of
the Rockies in Bozeman, Mont. ``It has a whole mouth full of steak
knives, which it almost exclusively used to eat meat.''
   Tyrannosaurus rex teeth were up to 6 inches long. The skull
being unearthed is 4 feet long, with eye sockets 4 to 5 inches in
diameter. The socket hole in the pelvis where the leg attached is
10 inches across.
   Horner, head of paleontology at the museum, said the scientific
value of the T-rex skeleton is limited, but it will be a big
drawing card for the museum.
   ``It's a real showy thing,'' he said Monday. ``Then we'll show
them things they might not have driven so far to see, but I think
are better.''
   Horner is known internationally for his discoveries of dinosaur
fossils in the northern Plains and the Rocky Mountain foothills, as
well as his theories on dinosaur behavior.
   His work has shown that dinosaurs tended to care for their
young, more like birds than modern-day reptiles. Among the museum
displays is a dinosaur nest, with fossilized baby dinosaurs just
emerging from their fossilized eggs.
   Horner said the Tyrannosaurus rex will be studied and a
scientific description written.
   Nicholas Hotton, a curator of paleontology at the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington, D.C., said any new knowledge about the
giant carnivore would help.
   Tyrannosaurus rex was discovered early this century.
   ``It was described in a paper three pages long and that's all
there is. Nobody has ever described it in detail,'' Hotton said.
   The newly discovered skeleton still has all the vertebrae from
the back and tail fused together. The skull broke off at the neck,
but is only several feet away from the neck and back. Leg bones
have been found near the skull and more are thought to be buried
beneath the other bones.
   It will take a dozen people several more weeks to finish the
painstaking task of exposing the bones, which will then be put in
plaster casts and loaded on trucks to be hauled to the museum.

   As thousands of scientists gather at an
international conference on AIDS, a matching army will fill the
streets with demonstrations to protest how the U.S. government is
dealing with the lethal illness.
   Protesters from around the country have arrived along with the
estimated 10,000 researchers attending the Sixth International
Conference on AIDS, which runs from Wednesday through Sunday.
   The protesters are led by the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power
(ACT UP), a militant group founded three years ago in New York. The
demonstrations are designed to call attention to what ACT UP member
Arawn Eibhlyn calls the ``complete lack of government response'' to
the epidemic.
   The protests began Tuesday afternoon when more than 1,000 people
marched 10 blocks through downtown to demonstrate at the offices of
the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, protesting the
1987 law barring people with the human immunodeficiency virus from
entering the country.
   The march was orderly. Eight people were arrested after going
through a police barrier in front of the building.
   One marcher was arrested by city police and seven by federal
police, all on misdemeanor charges, said San Francisco police
spokesman David Ambrose.
   As the arrests were made, the crowd chanted, ``The eyes of the
world are watching.''
   About halfway along the marchers' route, a huge cloth banner
reading ``Stop AIDS. Stop INS Terror,'' was unfurled from
scaffolding on a building.
   Later, about 100 people demonstrated inside the Marriott Hotel,
where part of the conference is being held, chanting, ``It's our
conference too.''
   Conference co-chairman Paul Volberding warned earlier Tuesday
that the 1992 conference is scheduled for Boston but may have to be
held outside the United States if the immigration restrictions are
not lifted.
   ``The policy has people riled up and angry,'' ACT UP member
Jorge Cortinas said. ``The pressure is really on.''
   ``These policies have nothing to do with stopping AIDS,'' San
Francisco AIDS Foundation member Rene Durazzo said of the
immigration law. ``They are to punish and abuse, it's that simple.''
   The INS in April agreed to grant 10-day visas to people with the
virus so that they could attend this and other professional
conferences.
   The grassroots ACT UP, known for its noisy demonstrations, has a
high-tech plan to coordinate the week of protests. Computers,
cellular phones, beepers and fax machines fill a sophisticated
media center, and the group plans to spend at least $40,000 during
the week, according to New York ACT UP member Cindy Acosta.
   Funds have been raised by a variety of means, from T-shirt sales
to auctions. A New York art auction raised $250,000, she said.
   ACT UP is among more than 100 international groups officially
boycotting the conference because of the immigration laws. However,
40 members of the New York ACT UP chapter will be attending anyway.
   ACT UP member Peter Staley, a former Wall Street bond trader, is
one of the conference speakers.
   ``I think it's really important for the scientific community to
realize that we are not against them,'' Acosta said. ``We're here
protesting the fact that the conference is being held in this
country.''
   On Wednesday, ACT UP members plan to protest the exclusion of
people with AIDS from research and treatment plans and the limited
seating available at the conference for those with the disease.
   Fewer than 400 seats have been reserved for patients, Costa
said, compared with over 2,000 seats for the media. Protesters are
expected to try to enter the conference.
   Outside the Moscone Center, protesters will hold a mock trial
focusing on what they see as the exclusion of patients from the
research process.
   On Thursday, activists plan to protest the so-called ``San
Francisco model'' of care for AIDS patients, which is heavily
dependent on volunteers. Protesters will march from City Hall to
the nearby federal and state buildings, then symbolically crumple
in exhaustion to symbolize the fatigued San Francisco AIDS network.
   Although the network has been recognized as one of the finest
examples of AIDS care in the world, increased caseloads and funding
conflicts have caused the organization to deteriorate.
   On Friday, activists will protest the exclusion of women,
children and minorities from research, treatment and services.
   On Saturday, the protests will focus on all people affected by
HIV and AIDS.
   ``We expect it to be one of the largest AIDS marches ever,'' ACT
UP member Josh Gameson said. More than 10,000 people, including
many conference participants, are expected to march, he said.
   On Sunday, the final day of the conference, demonstrators will
protest a speech by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan. The annual Lesbian and Gay Freedom Day parade, which
draws thousands of marchers and spectators, is also scheduled that
day.

<HEAD>Seven People Plead Innocent to Charges of Enslaving 100 Mexicans</HEAD>

   A flower grower pleaded innocent Tuesday to
charges of enslaving more than 100 illegal aliens at a ranch where
the laborers suffered beatings and were cheated, the U.S.
attorney's office said.
   Innocent pleas also were entered in U.S. District Court for six
other defendants and the corporation that owns the ranch near
Somis, about 50 miles northwest of Los Angeles.
   A federal grand jury indicted rancher Edwin M. Ives, 54, and the
six others on 15 counts, including violating labor and civil rights
laws and a federal anti-slavery statute, Assistant U.S. Attorney
Gregory Jessner said.
   If convicted on all counts, each defendant could face 52 years
in prison and up to $2 million in fines.
   Prosecutors allege smugglers lured Mexican workers, promising
good pay at the ranch. Ives then kept the illegal aliens corralled
behind a 7-foot fence to harvest flowers until they could each pay
$435 in smuggling fees, prosecutors contend.
   The workers toiled 16 hours a day for a fraction of the
$4.25-per-hour minimum wage, and had to buy necessities from a
company store at inflated prices, prosecutors said.
   The indictment alleges the flower farm operators beat the aliens
and threatened to alert immigration authorities if the workers
tried to leave.
   One worker apparently suffered permanent head and back injuries
during a beating. Ives refused to pay for treatment in the United
States and instead gave the worker $100 toward payment for
treatment in Mexico, the indictment says.
   Defense Attorney Robert M. Talcott said the case has been blown
completely out of proportion.
   ``Anyone who has had the opportunity to visit the ranch can see
with their own senses it is absolutely impossible to confine
someone against their will on those premises,'' he said.
   ``The ranch is 50 acres. It is accessible to a main highway
within walking distance to a small town. We know that people
desirous of working in the United States from Latin America walk
hundreds of miles, swim streams, crawl under fences and over fences
to get here,'' Talcott said. ``To say that they could not walk away
from this facility is ludicrous.''
   Named in the indictment in addition to Ives were Griffith-Ives
Company, foremen Pedro Pinzon-Juarez, 30; Rony Havive, 30; Alvaro
Ruiz-Santiago, 39; Josue David Pinzon-Juarez, 23; Paringer Singh,
age unknown, and an alleged alien smuggler, Mauro Casares-Padilla,
64.
   Authorities arrested the defendants on April 27. They were
released on $150,000 bond apiece. At earlier court appearances, the
bond for Ruiz-Santiago was reduced to $50,000 and for David
Pinzon-Juarez to $25,000. The bond for Singh, not one of the seven
original defendants, was reduced to $15,000.

<TEXT>
   The Air Force and Northrop Corp. lifted
the B-2 stealth bomber secrecy curtain another notch Tuesday,
allowing reporters a peek at the sprawling factory where the
radar-dodging planes are built.
   The 800,000-square-foot plant where Northrop performs final
assembly from parts provided by itself, Boeing, LTV and other
subcontractors was far quieter than a normal aerospace plant.
   Part of the technology that hides the B-2 from radar is the
plane's smooth surface, which is achieved by using a minimum of
rivets, nuts and bolts. That in turn makes for an eerily quiet
manufacturing process.
   The second through fifth of the flying wings _ their graphite
skins covering a honeycomb composite structure _ could be seen on
their assembly lines in the plant in the desert city north of Los
Angeles.
   Flanking them were terminals to a computer system whose
sophistication Northrop says far exceeds any ever used to build a
plane. Company officials predicted it will find wide use in
civilian manufacturing.
   The first B-2 is performing beyond expectations in initial
flight testing, completing stability control, in-flight refueling,
landings and other tests with few problems, said Bruce Hinds,
Northrop's chief test pilot.
   ``The airplane is maturing and we're able to operate efficiently
much earlier than we thought,'' he said.
   The plane, which Hinds said can turn sharply _ more like a
fighter than a bomber _ has been taken up to 35,000 feet and flown
at 373 mph. It has won praise from all the pilots who have flown
it, Hinds said.
   The tour came amid continuing efforts in Congress to kill the
B-2, which critics contend is far too expensive, especially as the
Cold War is ending.
   If the program were stopped with the construction of 15 planes,
as some favor, construction costs would be $35.4 billion.
   Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard M. Scofield, the B-2 program
director, said 15 planes would not be enough to provide a
significant military deterrent.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has suggested building 75 B-2s,
which would bring the total cost of the bombers to $62.4 billion.
   Ron Fraser, an analyst for the dovish Center for Defense
Information in Washington, said the real cost of building 75 planes
would be more than $110 billion, including $48 billion to operate
and support the bombers.
   ``So cutting it off now, the savings are huge,'' Fraser said.
``It's a bomber we don't need at any price and the price is pretty
darn stiff.''
   Northrop Chief Executive Kent Kresa and Scofield said such
concerns were shortsighted and that the United States should not
give up on a plane that will be useful decades into the 21st
century. They also argued that the manned bomber provides a needed
complement to a U.S. defense system that includes nuclear armed
submarines and land-based nuclear missiles.
   Kresa and Scofield disputed reports that stealth technology
could be counteracted by some radar systems.
   One of those systems, reportedly in Australia, was among 40
supposed stealth-busting techniques that the bomber was tested
against, Scofield said.
   He said the test showed the system had as much chance of
locating a stealth bomber as an individual equipped with a
flashlight would have of finding one person among a crowd of
thousands in the Rose Bowl at night.
   Marion McHugh, vice president of operations for Northrop's B-2
division, said 11 of the bombers are now 50 percent or more
complete.
   The 10th and 11th will take about 1.2 million worker hours to
construct. That's compared to 3.5 million for the first bomber,
which McHugh acknowledged took substantially longer to build than
anticipated. But he said officials are happy with the progress
being made.

<TEXT>
   The speaker of the Arizona House stripped two
committee chairmen of their posts and threatened to resign Tuesday
as she struggled for control of her rebellious Republican caucus.
   Speaker Jane Hull stripped Reps. Don Aldridge and Jim Skelly of
their chairmanships, of the Public Institutions and Rural
Development and House Judiciary committees, respectively, for
voting against her.
   Mrs. Hull has clashed with conservative Republicans over a
proposal to freeze the state's property tax rate and to pass along
an income tax windfall to taxpayers.
   The proposal was offered by fellow Republican Margaret Updike,
who said she wanted to ensure the Legislature didn't use the $170
million windfall or a property tax hike to balance a deficit budget.
   Majority Whip Chris Herstam tried to kill the proposal on a
procedural motion. Ten Republicans joined Democrats in voting
against him.
   But after Mrs. Hull threatened to replace any chairman who voted
against Herstam, all Republicans except Aldridge and Skelly fell
into line, giving Herstam a 32-25 margin.
   Rep. Brenda Burns sent Mrs. Hull a note during the debate,
saying the conservatives would back down if she promised to allow a
vote on Ms. Updike's proposal later.
   But Mrs. Hull refused to promise and tore up the note on the
floor. She challenged the conservatives to try to remove her as
speaker, and said she might resign.
   Later, after a three-hour closed caucus, Mrs. Hull said she had
come ``pretty darned close'' to resigning, but decided against it
``because we were able to sit and rationally discuss the budget.''
   House and Senate leaders have been trying for two weeks to drum
up votes for a bipartisan budget and tax package, but conservative
Republicans and a few Democrats in each chamber have balked.
   There has been talk of passing the $3.5 billion budget, which
includes a deficit of about $400 million, without a tax package to
fund it.
   Without specific legislation to the contrary, the windfall _
which has been passed on to taxpayers in past years _ would revert
to the state, and the property-tax rate would be increased from its
current 47 cents-per-$100 assessed valuation to whatever level
would cover the deficit.
   Skelly, a 20-year veteran of the Legislature, is not seeking
re-election and said losing his committee chairmanship was not
significant because the session is almost over and no more
committee meetings were scheduled.
   Aldridge said he was unwilling to give in to save his
chairmanship.
   House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Mark Killian, a leader
of the conservative faction, said the conservatives still opposed
the budget but recognized they could not block its passage.
   ``Some of us went and talked to the speaker and kind of put up
the white flag,'' he said. ``There's another day and another war.
Maybe we can do better next year.''

<HEAD>U.S. Military to Return Land to Japan</HEAD>

   The United States has agreed to return to Japan
2,500 acres of land used by the U.S. military on the southern
Japanese island of Okinawa, officials said Tuesday.
   The timetable for the return of the land is subject to
negotiations and further discussions by the two governments, the
Japanese Foreign Ministry announced.
   An interim report from the U.S.-Japan Joint Committee on
Realignment and Consolidation of U.S. Forces Facilities on Okinawa
said the land is in 23 sites.
   The land being returned makes up 2.5 percent of the 62,000 acres
used by U.S. military bases on Okinawa, a U.S. territory from 1945
until its reversion to Japan in 1972.
   American bases take up 20 percent of Okinawa prefecture's, or
state's, main island, and until the mid-1970s was Okinawa's main
source of income.
   Of 50,000 U.S. troops in Japan, about 35,000, mostly Marines and
Air Force personnel, are stationed on Okinawa, which has a
population of 1.2 million.
   The ministry listed part of a practice area at the northern end
of the island, part of Camp Hansen in central Okinawa, and part of
the Kadena ammunition storage area and Yaedake communications
facility in northeastern Okinawa among the sites to be returned.
   ``I see the agreement as a success to some extent, but it is not
enough for people of the prefecture,'' Okinawa Governor Junji
Nishime said. ``I strongly request the early return of the sites
excluded from the list this time, and further effort by both the
Japanese and the U.S. governments.''
   Japan and the United States have been conducting studies on the
possible realignment and consolidation of the U.S. bases since a
request to return more land was made by Nishime in April 1988.

<TEXT>
   Government troops recaptured a
state-owned aluminum plant Tuesday in a mining town after rebels
blew up an office building and a harbor dock, the army said.
   Army spokesman Bradressein Sital said initial reports indicated
there were ``a few wounded,'' but he had no further details on
casualties.
   Government forces have been battling Jungle Commando rebels for
three days for control of the Suriname Aluminum Co. plant near
Moengo, about 50 miles east of the capital Paramaribo.
   After the plant's recapture, fighting continued late Tuesday in
the Moengo region, where the rebels have set up a temporary base,
Sital said. He added that troops were advancing slowly on other
rebel positions because of roads boobytrapped with mines.
   Earlier, the army reported that the ethnic Bush Negro rebels had
blown up the aluminum plant's administrative building and its
harbor facilities on the Cottica River.
   After setting off the explosions, the Jungle Commando rebels
demanded to speak by radio telephone with President Ramsewak
Shankar, but the president refused, the army said.
   Communications between Moengo and Paramaribo have been
disrupted, and there was no immediate word from the Jungle Commando
on Tuesday's action.
   On Monday, the army said soldiers had surrounded Moengo and
warned its 8,000 residents to stay indoors. The warning came after
rebels threatened to blow up the aluminum company's smelter they
seized two weeks ago.
   Government forces, supported by two aircraft and a helicopter,
launched an offensive against the Jungle Commando rebels on Sunday.
   The army would not discuss troop movements, but reporters saw
200 to 300 soldiers with personnel carriers boarding a commercial
ferry early Tuesday to cross the Suriname River. The army
reportedly requisitioned the ferry to reinforce the troops already
in the mining district.
   The army has not disclosed how many troops are involved. The
country's armed forces have a strength of about 3,000.
   In Paris, meanwhile, French officials said Jungle Commando
leader Ronnie Brunswijk was arrested Monday night at the airport in
neighboring French Guiana. The officials said he was headed for the
Netherlands, Suriname's former colonial ruler, with false identity
papers.
   French Guiana Television quoted Brunswijk as saying he was tired
of fighting and wanted to give up his campaign.
   The government here declined comment on the report.
   Brunswijk's Jungle Commando, thought to number no more than 300
guerrillas, has been waging a hit-and-run war against the army the
past four years. The group seeks an improvement in conditions for
the South American nation's Bush Negro minority.
   Rebels seized the aluminum plant in an apparent attempt to
pressure President Ramsewak Shankar to implement a tentative peace
plan reached last summer with the Jungle Commando.
   Lt. Col. Desi Bouterse, the army chief and Suriname's former
military ruler, opposes the accord on the grounds it fails to
disarm the rebels and gives them effective control of the jungle
interior.
   Suriname, with 415,000 residents, is on the northeast coast of
South America.

<HEAD>Dissident Surfaces After 3 Weeks, Two Others Still Missing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An outspoken government critic who disappeared
nearly three weeks ago has surfaced, but two others remain missing,
a relative of one of the men said Tuesday.
   The three disappeared May 31, hours before they were to hold a
news conference to issue an open letter to Chinese leaders calling
for the release of political prisoners.
   Relatives and friends of the three _ folk singer Hou Dejian,
university newspaper editor Gao Xin and former university lecturer
Zhou Duo _ said they believed the men were in police custody,
although authorities refused to confirm it.
   A relative of Hou, Hou Yongwen, said Zhou visited her briefly
Monday and told her he expected the other two to return home soon.
   Ms. Hou said Zhou did not tell her whether he had been in police
custody or where he had been. He said he was separated from Hou and
Gao.
   ``He told me to just stay at home and keep waiting. He thinks
(Hou) will be back in a few days,'' she said.
   Efforts to reach Zhou were not successful.
   Zhou, 43, was in police custody for 10 months after joining Hou,
Gao and university lecturer Liu Xiaobo in staging a hunger strike
in the final days of last year's pro-democracy movement.
   Gao also was arrested after the movement was crushed in June
1989 and held for six months. Hou, who was born in Taiwan and
defected to the mainland in 1983, hid in the Australian Embassy for
more than two months last summer until the Chinese promised he
would not be arrested.
   Liu remains in prison without charge. In demanding the release
of political prisoners in their open letter, the three men
specifically asked for Liu's freedom.
   Hours before the planned news conference to announce the letter,
Hou called two foreign journalists to say it was canceled because
he had personal affairs to take care of.
   The three men were the only Chinese to continue publicly calling
for democratic reform after last year's June 3-4 military crackdown
on the democracy movement.
   After securing permission from police, Hou, Gao and Zhou
separately gave many interviews to foreign reporters the past few
months about their activities during the movement.

   President Bush is prodding Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir to open a dialogue with Palestinian Arabs
as the first step in reviving long-stalled Middle East peace talks.
   Bush, in a lengthy letter, asked the prime minister what his new
right-wing government was willing to do to promote peace, and
whether he still supports a plan for elections of Palestinian
representatives in the occupied territories, officials said Monday.
   The president's letter, sent in the last few days, adds weight
to a warning by Secretary of State James A. Baker III that the
United States will stop trying to get peace talks under way unless
Shamir makes compromises to open a dialogue with Palestinians.
   Confirming receipt of Bush's letter, Shamir said Bush ``asked me
for replies and explanations about our path in the framework of the
peace process.''

   President Bush is prepared to assure Nelson
Mandela that he won't push for removal of U.S. sanctions against
South Africa until that country meets all the conditions specified
by Congress, American officials say.
   The black leader is due to arrive in the United States on
Wednesday but won't meet with Bush until next Monday, using the
interim period more for ceremonial activities than for substantive
discussions.
   A ticker-tape parade in New York on Wednesday after a ceremonial
arrival at the airport will launch Mandela's three-day visit to
that city. He also will visit Boston before coming to Washington.
   Although he is philosophically opposed to sanctions, Bush is
expected to promise Mandela that his administration will comply
faithfully with the terms of 1986 legislation for ending the
sanctions, said the U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.

   The silent gunman who killed eight

repossessed his car also killed two people on a street the day
before, police said.
   James Edward Pough, 42, shot himself to death after his rampage
Monday at a General Motors Acceptance Corp. office.
   The day laborer from Jacksonville began firing a semiautomatic
rifle almost immediately after entering the large one-room office.
He shot two customers, one fatally, then went desk to desk,
shooting at employees cowering underneath.
   ``The shots kept coming closer and I kept hearing the moans of
people I know,'' said Rick Langille, a loan manager. ``The guy was

manner.
   Twenty-three American servicemen were killed during the December

   A man who shot and killed a policeman trying
to arrest him for a double murder said he held ``no grudges''
before being put to death in the electric chair in Arkansas' first
execution in 26 years.
   John Edward Swindler, 46, was pronounced dead at 9:05 p.m.
Monday, three minutes after being given 2,300 volts of electricit
in the big oak chair.
   Arkansas became the 14th state to carry out an execution and
Swindler the 130th inmate put to death since the U.S. Supreme Court
in 1976 let states resume use of capital punishment.
   Swindler was condemned for the 1976 murder of Fort Smith
policeman Randy Basnett, who was shot at a gas station while trying
to arrest Swindler for two murders in South Carolina. Swindler was
later convicted of those slayings as well.

   The House Judiciary Committee voted narrowly
Tuesday to send a constitutional amendment protecting the flag to
the House floor for a vote, as an Associated Press survey showed
the measure short of the support needed to pass Congress.
   The 19-17 committee vote set the stage for a showdown in the

   ``The close vote ... indicates that it's going to be a fairly

   Convicted drug dealer Charles Lewis,

   Lewis said he and Barry used the cocaine with model Rasheeda
Moore once in June 1986 in a hotel room. ``We were all standing in
line. We were using straws,'' Lewis said.
   Prosecutors opened the trial charging that the three-term mayor
was ``smoking crack and using cocaine all over town for years.''
   Defense attorney R. Kenneth Mundy countered that Barry was a
victim of entrapment and said the trial would reveal ``the depths
to which the government was willing to go and did go'' to bring
down the mayor of the nation's capital.

   A hard-line Communist from Siberia demanded

Tass reported.
   Kemerovo party chief Alexander Melnikov told the Russian
Communist Party conference on Tuesday that Gorbachev ``is sliding
toward the cult of personality'' and that he and the entire party
leadership should quit, the official Soviet news agency Tass said.
   The call by Melnikov came at the end of a day of heavy criticism
from conservatives at a meeting of Russian Communists that is
considered a dress rehearsal for a July 2 national party congress.
The congress is expected to overhaul the Soviet party leadership.
   Gorbachev, in power since March 1985, is the party's general
secretary and president of the Soviet Union, a post that earlier
this year he was elected to for five years.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On a Sunday morning 40 years ago,
North Korea sent thousands of troops across the 38th parallel into
South Korea, starting a war that killed more than a million people,
including 54,000 American soldiers.
   It is the only war the United States has entered in this century
that remains unresolved. The Korean peninsula, divided after World
War II, still is split between the communist North and the
capitalist South.
   The invasion stunned and enraged the West. The North Koreans
occupied Seoul, the South Korean capital, in three days and overran
most of the southern half of the peninsula in six weeks.
   Fifteen nations sent soldiers to fight for South Korea under the
U.S.-led United Nations Command. Twenty-five others provided
medical aid, food and weapons.
   China, with war just across its border, sent hundreds of
thousands of soldiers to help the North.
   When a cease-fire took effect 37 months later, the losses were
staggering: an estimated 2.4 million soldiers and 4.4 million
civilians killed or wounded. Military dead totaled more than
800,000. A land of remarkable beauty lay ravaged, treeless, burned
and barren.
   The Korean War was a traumatic chapter in American history and
its impact on succeeding generations has been profound.
   It was an inglorious war without victory, often nearly
forgotten, patched into history between World War II and Vietnam.
No peace treaty has been signed.
   ``It was a war in which we turned the tide against communism for
the first time, in a victory regrettably sometimes ignored by
history,'' President Bush said at a dinner for veterans of the war.
   Korea was the first confrontation of the big powers in the
nuclear age. It intensified hostilities between East and West, and
spurred a U.S.-Soviet arms race that only now is ending.
   From it grew the notion that communism in East Asia could be
contained with help from the U.S. military. That led to American
intervention in Vietnam a decade later.
   Forty years after the battle, North and South Korea watch one
another from behind barbed wire and concrete bunkers on either side
of a demilitarized zone 2{ miles wide and 155 miles long.
   The single telephone line between them is in Red Cross offices.
There is no mail, radio or television communication, no direct
travel without the permission of both governments, which is hardly
ever given.
   Nearly 9,000 American military personnel still are unaccounted
for or listed as prisoners.
   Last month, in a gesture seen as a political overture to
Washington, North Korea returned what it said were the remains of
five American soldiers. It was the first such action since 1954.
   The American Korean War Veterans Association says it has reports
from witnesses indicating some Americans still may be alive in
North Korea or other communist countries.
   Sporadic dialogue has occurred between the Koreas over the
years, but little progress has been made in lessening tension,
mutual suspicion and distrust. They have accused each other of more
than 1 million violations of the armistice agreement, an average of
75 a day since the war ended.
   Reunification of the peninsula, long a dream of Koreans on both
sides, remains elusive.
   The United States keeps 43,000 soldiers in South Korea to deter
another invasion. There are plans to reduce the number, but some
U.S. forces are expected to remain indefinitely.
   For Washington, the conflict of 1950-53 was a war in which the
politicians wrenched control from the generals. It is remembered as
much for President Harry Truman's firing of Douglas MacArthur as
for the general's bold strategy of pushing the enemy back with an
amphibious landing at Inchon, a western port.
   Historians divide the Korean war into the first year of
dramatic, far-reaching maneuvers and the next two years of static,
positional battle.
   Americans were not prepared mentally or physically for a war
fought in foxholes and trenches on rugged, mountainous terrain that
was freezing in winter and scorching in summer.
   No place was so cold, so dirty. Grease from a hundred C rations
was frozen to parkas and gloves. Underwear wasn't changed for
months. Perspiration in boots turned to ice in winter. Blood froze
on wounds before it could coagulate.
   Men fought hand-to-hand for small pieces of territory called
Punchbowl, Hamburger Hill, Heartbreak Ridge, Bunker Hill. Each
changed hands many times.
   More than 5 million men and women served in the American forces.
Their casualties were 103,284 wounded and 54,246 dead, including
33,629 killed in combat. The infantry bore the brunt of the
fighting.
   What began as a crusade to save South Korea from communism
enjoyed only brief public popularity. Soldiers returned home not to
a hero's welcome, but to a public dissatisfied with an unpopular,
unsatisfactory war.
   Weary soldiers, disheartened and dispirited, faded into the
placid, properous American society of the 1950s, keeping their pain
to themselves.
   Not until Vietnam veterans received public attention did the
Korean vets begin to organize. They formed an association five
years ago and are trying to raise $10.5 million for a memorial.
Korea is the only war without a memorial in Washington.
   In South Korea, the war is called the 6-25 incident, reflecting
the date it began and the Korean preference for numbering rather
than naming events.
   Some South Koreans feel shame that the country needed help to
defend itself and the anniversary is not a cause for celebration.
   Many people who remember those days remain deeply grateful to
the Americans. Monuments have been built in rice paddies and town
squares to all nations that sent soldiers and aid.
   The relationship between South Korea and the United States has
changed dramatically in the past 40 years. South Korea's booming
economy and growing pride in its own accomplishments make it less
tolerant of pressure from Washington on economic, trade and
political issues.
   Anti-American sentiment continues to grow. Visiting
Korean-Americans say relatives and others scold them for wearing
American-style haircuts and clothes, and for speaking Korean with
American accents.
   Most Koreans disapprove of militants who burn U.S. flags and
shout ``Yankee go home,'' however, and polls indicate they want
American troops to remain.

   Millions of soldiers and civilians
were killed or wounded in the 37 months of the Korean war, but
exact figures may never be known, military experts and scholars say.
   Some estimates run as high as 2.2 million in the military on
both sides and 4.4 among civilians. The communist side did not
provide casualty figures and many bodies were buried in mass graves.
   American military casualties were 33,629 killed in combat,
20,617 dead from other causes and 103,284 wounded. More than 8,500
GIs were listed as unaccounted for or as prisoners of war.
   Statistics compiled by the U.N. Command in Seoul indicate at
least 200,000 Chinese soldiers, 225,000 South Korean soldiers and
300,000 North Korean troopers killed. Hundreds of thousands were
wounded.
   Casualties of the 15 other nations that fought under the
U.S.-led United Nations Command totaled 14,501.

from gunboats through surgical teams to tons of food and medicine.
   Fifteen nations sent soldiers to fight under the U.N. Command,
which was led by the United States.
   Records of the U.N. Command dated January 1951 show five nations
gave medical assistnce. Denmark sent the hospital ship Jutlandia;
India, Italy and Sweden provided field hospitals and ambulances,
and Norway sent a mobile surgical hospital.
   India provided 400,000 jute bags to hold rice donated by
Thailand, Ecuador, Nicaragua, and the Philippines.
   From Mexico came tons of chickpeas and beans. Belgium, Cuba and
Denmark gave more than 3,000 tons of sugar.
   Iceland sent 125 tons of cod liver oil. Other gifts included
70,000 blankets from Uruguay, 1,000 units of plasma from the
Philippines, 5,000 tons of wheat from Pakistan and 150 tons of
powdered milk from New Zealand.
   Soap arrived in the hundreds of tons from Australia, Greece, New
Zealand, the Philippines and Venezuela.
   The 15 nations that sent soldiers to join the U.S. Army in
fighting for South Korea were Australia, Belgium, Britain, Canada,
Colombia, Ethiopia, France, Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
New Zealand, the Philippines, South Africa, Thailand and Turkey.

<HEAD>A Korean Orphan's Search for a GI Named Billy</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Korea-Forgotten War</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Baik Sung-hak was a 12-year-old orphan
and felt lucky to be taken on by a U.S. artillery unit as a
``washy-washy boy.''
   He was not paid in money, but in food, candy, gum and the
friendship of a GI he called Billy, who also had been an orphan.
   Thousands of children were orphaned or separated from their
families in the three years of the Korean war, which began in 1950.
   American soldiers often gave the children food, candy and coins,
but the GIs always moved on.
   ``Billy stayed in my heart,'' said Baik, now a wealthy,
50-year-old hat manufacturer.
   An enemy shell landed beside Baik on a riverbank one day. He was
enveloped in burning gasoline and jumped into the river, screaming.
   ``Billy jumped in after me, got me out, rushed me to the
hospital,'' he said. ``When I woke up after 18 hours, Billy was
there. Billy was kind to all the orphans, but especially to me. We
orphans usually ate the leftovers, but Billy would always save a
plate of food for me.''
   Baik was sent to an orphanage after the war. He ran away, worked
at odd jobs and began what would be a 30-year search for Billy
through newspapers, veterans organizations and military listings on
two continents.
   Eventually, he became a successful businessman and established
Billy House, a home for orphans and the handicapped northeast of
Seoul.
   In 1986, he was invited to a reunion in Kansas City of 14 men
from Billy's old unit.
   ``At the reunion, I went through files and files of pictures,''
he said. ``I remember screaming, `That's Billy!' and the others
just stared at me.''
   ``That's not Billy, that's David Beattie,'' someone said. No one
knew where Beattie lived. ``Billy'' was what ``Beattie'' had
sounded like to a 12-year-old Korean orphan.
   In September 1989, a friend telephoned Baik and told him Beattie
had been located in Philadelphia. That was where they met, later
that month, for the first time in nearly 40 years.
   ``The minute I saw him, I knew he was Billy,'' he said.
   A few weeks ago, Beattie, 59, returned to Korea for the first
time since the war as Baik's guest.
   ``Hak was a strong boy and he was always willing to help me,''
he said, referring to Baik by one of his given names. ``I never
thought of looking for him. After the war was over, I went back
home and that was it.''
   ``I recognized Hak as soon as I saw him. I didn't know what to
say. When we first met, we just stared at each other for a few
minutes.''
   Baik says he wants their children to meet. He has two and
Beattie has four.

<HEAD>Palo Alto Computer Giant Announces New Workstation Series</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hewlett-Packard Co. unveiled a line of
products that for the first time blends its workstation technology
with that of Apollo Computer, which Hewlett-Packard bought for $500
million last year.
   The success of the new Series 400 computer workstations will
help determine whether Hewlett-Packad's biggest acquisition will
give the Palo Alto-based company a competitive edge in the $5.8
billion worldwide workstation market.
   So far, competitors say the acquisition of Apollo, which is
based in Chelmsford, Mass., has caused Hewlett-Packard to lose
market share.
   ``HP has gone AWOL since the Apollo acquisition,'' said Scott
McNealey, president and CEO of Sun Microsystems Inc. of Mountain
View, Calif., Hewlett-Packard's leading rival in the workstation
market.
   Hewlett-Packard on Monday introduced a set of workstations based
on Motorola Inc.'s 68030 microprocessor. The company also planned
more advanced workstations, but delays in production of a computer
chip will keep it from shipping those systems until later in 1990.
   The workstations will cost $5,000-$14,000, and they will offer
performance levels that match Sun's market-leading SPARCstation,
according to Bill Kay, general manager of Hewlett Packard's
workstation group.
   The introduction comes as Hewlett Packard restructures in an
effort to reverse a four-quarter trend of falling profits despite
rising revenues.
   The company's earnings fell 8 percent to $186 million, or 78
cents a share, in its second quarter ending April 30, while sales
rose 16 percent to $3.3 billion.
   The industry of the 1990s requires a strong position in
workstations _ systems that are more powerful than personal
computers but less powerful than minicomputers.
   Minicomputers, fast becoming an industry dinosaur, are the core
of Hewlett-Packard's business and yield the highest profits of its
product lines.
   Although the Apollo acquisition briefly vaulted Hewlett-Packard
to No. 1 in workstations, Sun quickly regained the lead with
faster, cheaper and more advanced products. Others also are
fighting for a piece of the market.
   Since the Apollo acquisition, Hewlett-Packard's share of the
workstation market slipped to 26 percent last year from 30 percent
in 1988. Sun controlled 30 percent of the market at the end of last
year.
   ``Everybody says that because of the merger we lost the lead,''
said Lew Platt, executive vice president for Hewlett-Packard's
computer products. ``But that lead has been handed off a number of
times in the last few years. Nobody's had it consistently.''
   Hewlett-Packard's new workstations aren't expected to close the
gap, according to analysts and competitors.
   The company's competitors have been selling workstations based
on a more advanced technology called reduced instruction set
computing, or RISC, in the same price range for more than a year.
RISC speeds up computers by cutting the number of instructions they
have to complete to perform a task. Hewlett-Packard is the only
major workstation vendor that hasn't come out with a low-cost
RISC-based workstation.
   Kay countered that the company's new workstations will match the
performance of RISC-based machines. He also said the company will
have its own competitive RISC workstations on the market at the end
of this year.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of First Executive Corp. told
Congress that former junk bond chief Michael Milken did not dictate
investment strategy to the California insurance concern, a big junk
bond buyer.
   Fred Carr also told a House subcommittee Monday that while a
Milken-controlled company had a major stake in a First Executive
subsidiary, neither Carr nor First Executive invested in any
partnerships run by the former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. banker.
   ``This is a chance for me to clear the record,'' Carr told the
investigations subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee in a statement.
   The panel has been investigating some 400 limited partnerships _
controlled largely by Drexel employees _ that bought significant
stakes in hot junk bond issues underwritten by Drexel before they
were made available to the public.
   Critics have said the activity drove up the price of those
issues at the expense of Drexel customers, but the transactions'
legality has never been resolved.
   Under questioning by the subcommittee chairman, Rep. John
Dingell, D-Mich., Carr denied Milken had authority to trade on
behalf of any First Executive accounts.
   Dingell said the subcommittee had information that Milken used
to dictate trades on Friday afternoons to an assistant who would
pass them on to First Executive.
   But Carr said, ``I have no knowledege of what he dictated to
anybody.''
   The subscommittee also plans to call Milken and disgraced stock
speculator Ivan F. Boesky as witnesses.
   The subcommittee authorized a subpoena for Boesky last year. And
the panel voted unanimously last month to subpoena Milken, who
pleaded guilty in April to six felonies and agreed to pay $600
million in penalties.
   But the Justice Department is concerned about Milken's
testifying, under immunity, before he is sentenced Oct. 1.
   Dingell, the subcommittee chairman, has said he wants to hear
from Milken before Congress adjourns Aug. 3 for a month-long summer
break.
   William McLucas, head of enforcement for the Securities and
Exchange Commission, and Alan Cohen, chief of the securities fraud
unit of the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan, declined to
discuss the issue.
   But sources close to the case have said the Justice Department
is concerned that if Milken testifies under immunity before
Congress and then withdraws his guilty plea, it could make it
difficult to prosecute him.
   Carr testified without immunity Monday.
   Dingell said the purpose of the hearing was ``to determine
whether the regulatory system is properly addressing the increasing
use of junk bonds as security for insurance policies that people
depend upon to be safe and sound.''
   Junk bonds are high-yielding corporate bonds with low investment
ratings, meaning they carry a high risk of not being paid. Junk
bonds were used to finance many mergers, takeovers and leveraged
buyouts in the 1980s.
   Dingell noted that insurance companies account for about 30
percent of the junk bond market and junk bonds constitute between
45 percent and 60 percent of First Executive's holdings.
   First Executive suffered a $836 million net loss in the fourth
quarter of 1989 because of a writedown in the value of its junk
bond portfolio. The company rebounded to post a profit of $45.5
million in this year's first quarter.
   ``A proper regulatory system should assure that insurance
companies do not face insolvency because they overdose on junk
bonds,'' said Dingell. ``The collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert and
defaults by some issuers have forced First Executive to write-down
its portfolio by more than $1 billion during the past several
months,'' Dingell added.
   But Carr insisted in his opening statement that ``Executive Life
is an example of a life insurance company that has managed to
remain sound and solvent despite the recent massive turmoil in the
so-called junk market, despite extreme adverse publicity.''

<HEAD>Chicago Options, American and Cincinnati Stock Exchanges Plan Late
Trading</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The move toward off-hours trading to compete
with foreign exchanges got another boost as three exchanges agreed
to cooperate on a computerized system to trade stock and stock
options through the night.
   The American Stock Exchange, the Chicago Board Options Exchange
and the Cincinnati Stock Exchange on Monday announced plans to
implement an automated nighttime system in two to three years.
   The New York Stock Exchange announced a different after-hours
plan last week. London and Tokyo have been getting more of the
business in U.S.-listed issues while markets in this country are
closed.
   ``This agreement is a milestone in the internationalization of
securities markets, and we welcome other securities exchanges to
join us in this endeavor,'' said Duke Chapman, chairman and chief
executive of the CBOE.
   Officials of the exchanges, speaking at simultaneous news
conferences in New York and Chicago linked by television, said they
had asked the NYSE and Tokyo exchanges to join them. But the Big
Board indicated it didn't want to give up its leading role in U.S.
stocks.
   ``The New York Stock Exchange today has the largest, most cost
efficient computer system in the world and we would like to invite
the CBOE and AMEX into our system ... which was announced last
week,'' said NYSE spokesman Richard Torrenzano.
   The AMEX, CBOE and Cincinnati exchange plan to operate their
electronic trading system between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. Eastern time.
Stocks now trade from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. and options from 9:30
a.m. until 4:10 p.m. or 4:15 p.m.
   The CBOE would build and maintain the electronic exchange's main
computer while Reuters Holdings PLC would provide the network to
link dealers with the computer.
   Reuters currently provides electronic dealing networks for
foreiggn exchange and bond dealers and also is a leading supplier
of financial market news.
   The CBOE and AMEX would provide a market in their stock options,
while the Cincinnati exchange would offer stocks listed on that
regional exchange.
   The New York Stock Exchange last week revealed plans to begin
limited after-hours trading this year with an eye to 24-hour
trading by the end of the decade. The plan calls for thrice-nightly
auctions of Big Board-listed stocks at 8 p.m., midnight and 5 a.m.,
beginning next year.
   The deal announced Monday represents a major cooperative effort
at a time when competition is heating up among exchanges that
handle stock options. A new federal rule allows for multiple
listings of stock options, which now are assigned to particular
exchanges.
   Under the computerized nighttime system, the marketplace that
establishes itself as the primary exchange for a particular issue
will handle the stock option in the after-hours session.
   ``The American Stock Exchange and the Chicago Board Options
Exchange will still compete,'' Jones said. But, he conceded, ``In
the newly carved-out trading hours we will put aside some of
today's competitive battles.''
   The precise number of issues that will be traded have yet to be
determined. The Cincinnati exchange trades about 500 issues, while
the American exchange and CBOE account for about 80 percent of the
nation's options trading.
   The exchange executives said it was possible that other
products, such as stock index options, could be traded through the
system.
   ``The CBOE and AMEX would have to agree to make their products
available,'' said Richard DuFour, the executive vice president for
product development at the CBOE. ``We'll choose products that are
most attractive to overseas customers.''
   Options are financial instruments that give holders that right
to buy or sell 100 shares of a stock at a designated price for a
certain amount of time. The three exchanges and Reuters announced
their intention to work on a common system in March 1989. They said
they reached a definitive agreement about a month ago, and the
boards of the companies finished approving the plan late last week.

   LTV Corp. says it cannot afford to resume
responsibility for $2.3 billion in pension liabilities despite a
U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding a government agency's effort
to force the company to fund the plans.
   LTV Senior Vice President Julian Scheer said the decision Monday
in favor of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. will delay the
company's efforts to emerge from bankruptcy court protection.
   ``LTV filed for Chapter 11 protection four years ago because,
among other things, we could not afford to make payments into these
three pension plans,'' the company said in a statement. ``That
situation has not changed. We still cannot afford the plans. It
will be the company's objective to continue to seek a resolution
which recognizes the fact.''
   LTV, which has sold off much of its steel operations, plans to
reorganize as a streamlined company.
   Chriss Street, a bankruptcy expert at Seidler Amdec Securities
Inc. in Chicago who has dealt with many of LTV's creditors, said
the company probably has enough cash to pay the claims, ``but in
paying the pension claim they would have to turn the keys to the
company over to the PBGC and all the other creditors would
essentially be left holding the bag.''
   The Supreme Court ruling ``assures that LTV will be mired in
further litigation,'' Street said.
   Gary Heinz, an analyst at Delaware Bay Co. in New York, said he
would expect creditors to push the bankruptcy judge to end the
company's exclusive right to come up with a reorganization plan.
   By an 8-1 vote, the Supreme Court said the PBGC acted within its
authority when it ordered LTV and its subsidiary, LTV Steel Co., to
restore the pension plans with unfunded liabilities of $2.3 billion.
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, who chairs the PBGC's board of
directors, said the ruling would help the agency protect the
pensions of 40 million American workers and retirees.
   ``While pensions as a whole are healthier than ever, some
companies in certain industries have seriously underfunded
pensions,'' Mrs. Dole said. ``PBGC's victory in this case will help
discourage unwarranted termination of pension plans and encourage
better funding of pensions.''
   After filing for bankruptcy reorganization in 1986, Dallas-based
LTV and its Cleveland-based LTV Steel subsidiary advised the PBGC
that they could not fund their pension plans. The plans were ended
in 1987.
   But in a later deal with the United Steelworkers union, LTV
Steel agreed to make up any benefits promised under the old plan
but not covered by the federal pension insurance program.
   The PBGC, a government agency that takes over pension plans that
end with insufficient money to fund benefits, objected and ordered
LTV to reassume responsibility for the pension plans. Monday's
court ruling backed the agency.
   ``We're not happy with the decision, (but) it's certainly is not
considered a back-breaker,'' LTV's Scheer said. ``The question is
how do we handle this tremendous obligation. We don't have an
answer.''
   ``Retermination certainly is something we'll have to look at,''
he said. ``We hope and we believe that there is room for
negotiations with the PBGC, taking into consideration the fact that
they understand our economic realities.''
   Michael S. Gordon, a Washington pensions lawyer, said the
ruling's impact may be limited.
   ``While companies might be tempted to rid themselves of pension
liabilities through the bankruptcy code ... I think that's a pretty
harried course for most major corporations. I don't know that it's
impact is as cosmic as some would have you believe,'' Gordon said.
   ``Nonetheless, it was a loophole that could be exploited. It's
closed now and it's a good thing,'' he said.
   LTV has returned to profitability after posting billions in
losses, much of it tied to its bankruptcy costs and accounting for
pension funds. In 1988 alone the company lost $3.15 billion on
sales of $7.3 billion.
   Last year, LTV earned 264.9 million on sales of $6.36 billion.
Earnings in the first three months of 1990 slipped to $44.2 million
from $76.6 million a year earlier. Sales dropped to $1.49 billion
from $1.61 billion.

   Pollution damage claims against Ashland
Oil Co. soared to $2.725 billion as hundreds of people joined a
lawsuit against the company over alleged refinery discharges.
   Ashland, however, asked a judge Monday to overturn a $10.3 jury
award that forms a basis for the other claims. The company said the
trial was riddled with errors and added that the judge and jury
foreman did not disclose past relationships with the plaintiffs'
attorneys.
   ``In the collective experience of Ashland's counsel, they have
never encountered a trial afflicted by errors as numerous or as
grievous as those committed in the trial of this matter,'' the
company's motion said.
   Rod Jackson, the plaintiffs' lead attorney, dismissed Ashland's
motion as ``desperation.''
   Kanawha County Circuit Court Judge Tod Kaufman, who presided
over the trial, is to hear the appeal June 29. He is out of the
country on vacation and was unavailable for comment Monday, his
office said.
   Late last month, a jury awarded $10.3 million to four residents
living near Ashland's refinery in Catlettsburg, Ky.
   The residents alleged that a caustic white substance emitted
from the refinery had damaged their property and affected their
health. The exact nature of the substance was not established at
the trial, and Ashland argued that residents presented no evidence
of illness or property damage.
   On Monday, 681 more current and past area residents filed suit
in Kanawha Circuit Court against Ashland, bringing the total number
of suits pending to more than 1,100, Jackson said. He is
representing 912 residents in one suit, he said.
   The new claims raise the total compensation sought to $2.725
billion from $840 million previously, Jackson said. Most of the
plaintiffs live in western West Virginia, across the Ohio River
from the refinery.
   Ashland reported profits of $85 million last year on sales of
$8.5 billion.
   Ashland spokesman Roger Schrum said the allegations in the
latest suits are without merit.
   The company has requested affidavits from each person filing a
suit because ``Mr. Jackson has gotten carried away with his numbers
in the past,'' Schrum said.
   In their motion to overturn the May verdict, Ashland's lawyers
said Charleston lawyer Rudy DiTrapano, a partner of Jackson's in
the law firm that represented the plaintiffs, once represented
Kaufman's family.
   The judge's parents and brother were killed in a 1980 car
accident. DiTrapano filed two lawsuits on behalf of their estates,
later settling them for $40,000.
   DiTrapano and Jackson each made contributions to Kaufman's
general and primary election campaigns in 1988, according to the
company's motion.
   Jackson, partner in the firm DiTrapano &amp; Jackson, said a law
firm is under no obligation to reveal past legal relationships with
a judge.
   ``This is just another red herring across the judicial path. It
has nothing to do with the case,'' Jackson said.
   Ashland Oil also said jury foreman Lou Henri Hunt in 1987 was
represented in two different cases by Jackson and by a law firm run
by the father of plaintiff's attorney D.L. Hamilton.
   Hunt should have disclosed her relationship with the lawyers and
should have been dismissed from jury duty, the company said. But
Jackson said Hunt's relationship with the Hamilton firm came up
during jury selection.
   Hunt declined comment Monday.
   ``The trial is over. I'm just tired of this,'' she said.

<HEAD>Excalibur Prepares for Tuesday Grand Opening</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's largest hotel _ a gargantuan castle
designed to entice a growing legion of Middle America gamblers _
opens today, and a full house is expected to enjoy mock medieval
pageantry at the 4,032-room property.
   ``Isn't this the most sensational thing you've ever seen,''
actor Ernest Borgnine enthused as he watched a knight on a white
horse prance across a lobby area of the Excalibur Hotel and Casino
in a pre-opening VIP party Monday night. ``Just look at this. What
can you possibly say.''
   Hundreds of the Las Vegas business, political and social elite
milled about the $290 million property. Minstrels, jugglers and
harpists entertained guests, a 10-foot dragon cavorted and a man in
a suit of armor walked stiffly amid the guests.
   The entertainers will be standard fare in what promises to be
one of the country's more unique properties.
   Tuesday's formal opening will mark a milestone for Circus Circus
Enterprises, Inc., the gaming-hotel operation that has carved a
niche in Las Vegas and Nevada for Middle America.
   Chairman William Bennett said he was pleased with Monday night's
turnout, and with his latest property.
   ``Everything seems to be going just fine,'' he said.
   Glenn Schaeffer, chief financial officer for the company, said
the Excalibur was getting 4,000 reservation calls a day. ``People
think we have a hit,'' he said.
   The $1.6 billion Circus Circus company, which started with a
struggling Strip hotel-casino 16 years ago, has become the envy of
the gaming industry with a unique strategy focusing on small-time
players rather than coveted high-rollers.
   Bennett announced to stockholders last week that the company
planned to reduce its $500 million debt by about $200 million in
the coming year, largely on added revenue from the Excalibur.
Schaeffer said Monday the company could probably pay off all its
debt in three or four years from Excalibur revenue, but may opt to
look at new projects.
   Schaeffer said the company, which once eyed Atlantic City, now
has no interest in expanding to the New Jersey market where the
likes of Donald Trump are struggling.
   The giant castle at the south end of the glitzy Las Vegas Strip
is the brainchild of Bennett, who amassed a personal fortune of
$500 million catering to families in a gaming environment.
   The Excalibur is anchored by four 28-story towers, covers 70
acres and has a staff of 4,300.
   It will replace two other Las Vegas properties that have held
the title of the world's largest hotel.
   Tuesday's opening will give Circus Circus a total of 11,320
rooms in Nevada, including two hotels in Las Vegas, one in Reno and
two in Laughlin. By comparison, Atlantic City's 12 major hotels
total 8,100 rooms.
   The Excalibur will give Las Vegas 75,000 hotel rooms.
   The success of Circus Circus has nudged Las Vegas toward other
family-oriented features, transforming the gaming capital into a
total resort destination.
   Circus Circus rooms average $33 a night, while the Excalibur
will average $45.
   Some 500,000 square feet of public entertainment space includes
a Renaissance-era village, 12 food outlets and a casino the size of
four football fields, with 2,630 slot machines. Shows will feature
a medieval flair, with live jousting.
   An arcade will feature a dozen themed game booths such as
archery and electronic crossbows.

<TEXT>
   For the McMahon family in Aliquippa, Pa., a
Supreme Court ruling on retired steelworkers' pensions means an
extra $120 a month.
   For the federal agency that insures the pensions of 30 million
American workers, the ruling means a savings of up to $8 billion in
potential pension liabilities.
   The court on Monday broadened the authority of the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corp. to order employers to restore terminated
pension plans in a case involving LTV Corp. and its subsidiary, LTV
Steel Co.
   ``We feel like justice was done. We weren't asking for miracles.
We only want what we're owed and to keep other retirees from having
this happen to them,'' said Carole McMahon, who said her husband's
$950 monthly pension was shortchanged $120 a month after LTV filed
for bankruptcy protection in 1986 and its pension plans were
terminated.
   Federal officials called the ruling a victory that benefits all
Americans because it helps keep solvent the nation's system of
insuring pensions.
   Not only will the ruling keep the PBGC from having to pay LTV's
unfunded liabilities of $2.3 billion, it also might save another $8
billion because companies will be discouraged from following LTV's
lead, said James B. Lockhart, exeutive director of the agency.
   ``It removes a major cloud that has been overhanging the agency
for 2{ years,'' Lockhart said. He added the agency knew of a
handful of companies that were considering terminating their
pension plans through bankruptcy proceedings.
   However, Michael S. Gordon, a Washington pension lawyer, said
the LTV case was ``a relatively isolated example.''
   ``While companies might be tempted to rid themselves of pension
liabilities through the bankruptcy code ... I think that's a pretty
harried course for most major corporations. I don't know that its
impact is as cosmic as some would have you believe,'' Gordon said.
   ``Nonetheless, it was a loophole that could be exploited. It's
closed now and it's a good thing,'' Gordon said.
   The PBGC takes over a pension plan's assets and liabilities when
a company ends the plan with insufficient money to satisfy promised
benefits. The agency then pays the pensions, but sets limits on
some types of benefits.
   Ultimately, taxpayers shoulder the burden of PBGC liabilities.
   Mrs. McMahon, who is part of a union retirees' activist group,
said the ruling would protect other retirees across the country.
   ``If this had not happened, all of these other companies would
have seen LTV escaping and taking these losses from their
retirees,'' she said.
   Though retirees are pleased to have their pensions fully funded,
they are worried LTV might make up the difference with decreased
health care benefits, Mrs. McMahon said.
   ``People are scared right now because we don't know what's going
to happen,'' she said.
   Alice Lynd, a Youngstown, Ohio, lawyer representing LTV
retirees, said the average LTV pensioner received $40 a month less
after LTV terminated its pension plan.
   The PBGC has money problems of its own _ a $1 billion deficit.
It currently lists assets of about $3.2 billion and liabilities of
about $4.2 billion.
   The Dallas-based LTV and its Cleveland-based LTV Steel
subsidiary, after filing for reorganization under federal
bankruptcy law in 1986, advised the PBGC that they could not fund
the pension plans they sponsored. The plans were ended in 1987.
   In a deal with the United Steelworkers union, however, LTV Steel
agreed to what government lawyers called a ``follow-on''
arrangement. Under it, LTV agreed to make up any benefits lost to
retirees that are not covered by the federal pension insurance
program.
   The PBGC contended such arrangements are abusive, and the agency
ordered LTV to reassume responsibility for the pension plans. When
LTV refused, the agency sought to enforce its order in federal
court.

<HEAD>Midland Cogeneration Plant Sold for $2.3 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF HOLYFIELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Midland cogeneration power plant, once
an aborted nuclear plant seen as a white elephant, has been sold
for $2.3 billion, CMS Energy reported.
   The deal was believed to be the largest sale-leaseback in U.S.
history, the company, based in Dearborn, said Monday.
   Paul Knopick, a CMS spokesman, said 65 percent of the plant _
built as a nuclear facility but later converted to a gas-fired
cogeneration plant _ was bought by a group of major companies that
did not want to be identified.
   The remaining 35 percent was bought by a CMS subsidiary, with
the plant leased back to the original partnership that converted it
into a gas-fired facility. The deal is for 25 years.
   The original partnership included CMS and Dow Chemical Co.
Michigan's largest utility, Consumers Power Co., a CMS subsidiary.
   The partnership halted construction of the plant in 1984 after
spending $4.2 billion. It was 85 percent complete when the facility
became mired in financing and regulatory wrangles.
   The Midland Cogeneration Venture partnership spent $600 million
to convert the plant to a gas-fired cogeneration facility, the
nation's largest. The plant now makes steam for industrial use and
also produces electricity. It began producing power for Dow in
March.
   About $380 million of the $2.3 billion deal was in cash, Knopick
said.
   The partners also agreed to form a second partnership to
investigate expanding the Midland plant, he said.
   ``We know the Midwest, Canada, and Michigan are going to need
more electricity in the 1990s and we see the Midland Cogeneration
Venture as being a key provider of that power,'' he said.
   Knopick said the capacity of the facility, which produces 1,370
megawatts of electricity and 1.35 million pounds per hour of steam,
could be doubled.

<HEAD>Arthur Andersen Announces Joint Venture With Soviet Companies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. has announced it will set
up a joint venture with two Soviet businesses, becoming the first
U.S. public accounting firm to do audit work in the Soviet Union.
   The Soviet Ministry of Finance has approved the joint venture,
called Arthur Andersen in the U.S.S.R., according to a statement
issued Monday by the Chicago-based accounting firm.
   Andersen has a 70 percent stake in the venture, with
Promstroybank of the U.S.S.R., the largest bank in the country,
having 30 percent and NPO Dinamo Moscow, an engineering industrial
company, having 5 percent.
   ``As part of the Arthur Andersen audit, tax, financial and
business consulting unit, this joint venture will provide
assistance to Soviet state and other enterprises in adapting
themselves to free market management techniques,'' according to the
company statement.
   ``It will also consult with Soviet Western joint ventures and is
the first western organization to audit such ventures.''
   Andrea Von Knoop was named general director of the new venture.
Von Knoop is a former employee of the Deutsche Bank.
   According to the statement, the joint venture, based in Moscow,
marks the re-emergence of Andersen operations in the Soviet Union.
After eight years of activity there, the firm suspended Soviet
operations in 1983, the statement said. But it also said that for
more than a year, teams from Andersen have been working in the
Soviet Union on various projects.

<HEAD>Heinz Earnings Up in Fourth Quarter, Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   H.J. Heinz Co. said today its earnings
increased 15.5 percent in the fourth quarter as price increases and
sales gains boosted income.
   The maker of ketchup and other food products reported
fourth-quarter net income totaled $135.3 million, or 51 cents per
share, compared with $117.2 million, or 44 cents per share, in the
same period of 1989.
   Fourth-quarter sales increased 3.9 percent to $1.69 billion from
$1.63 billion a year earlier. Heinz said strong growth in sales of
ketchup and tuna was offset by declining sales of other products.
   Net income for the year ended May 2 increased 14.6 percent to a
record $504.4 million, or $1.90 per share, from $440.2 million, or
$1.67 per share, in fiscal 1989, Heinz said.
   Sales for the year increased 4.9 percent to about $6 billion
from $5.8 billion in 1989.
   Heinz Chairman Anthony J.F. O'Reilly said the year's increase in
operating profit reflects the company's continued strength.
   ``Our big brands _ ketchup, tuna, frozen potatoes, baby food,
and Weight Watchers brand food products _ continue to prove their
market strength and brand leadership, providing a solid foundation
for the future,'' he said.

   The newspaper industry is witnessing new
technologies that will turn problems into opportunities, but those
new systems are only as good as the people who run them, according
to industry executives.
   ``Without the right well-trained people, all the technology in
the world won't do us much good,'' Lloyd G. Schermer told delegates
to the 62nd annual technical exposition of the American Newspaper
Publishers Association on Monday. ``That's why, in this decade as
never before, we must develop our people.''
   Schermer, chief executive officer of Lee Enterprises, Inc.,
Davenport, Iowa, said newspapers will need technology, training and
teamwork to meet the competitive challenges of the 1990s.
   Schermer also warned that proposed new postal rates pose a
threat for publishers. First, second and third class mailers face
double digit postal rate increases while the rate would drop 10
percent for third class mailers who can demonstrate 75 percent or
more ``saturation'' coverage, he said.
   Only one or two third class mailers that specialize in direct
mail advertising would be able to take advantage of the lower rate,
Schermer said.
   ``The monopoly postal service clearly sees its future as a
distributor of advertising hard copy rather than first class
letters,'' Schermer said.
   Madelyn P. Jennings, senior vice president of personnel for
Gannett Co. Inc., said people are a critical commodity for
newspapers wishing to realize the most from new technologies.
   ``If we leave out the people quotient, we can't possibly get the
return on the investment promised,'' she said. ``We are pioneers in
a new territory. Our success depends on a skilled and motivated
workforce.''
   ``You wouldn't put up with a press operating at 75 percent of
capacity,'' she said. ``You shouldn't put up with employees working
at 75 percent of capacity. People and presses don't work very well
unless they're cared for.''
   In the decade ahead, the quality of people will make the
difference in America's newspapers.
   ``Developing our people isn't a cost, it's a blue chip
investment,'' she said.
   Two Las Vegas newspaper executives, Review-Journal general
manager David Osborn and Sun president Brian Greenspun, delivered
welcoming addresses at Monday's opening general session.
   Some 14,000 newspaper executives are focusing on changing
newspaper technology at the convention, which runs through
Wednesday.
   The event features the largest display of newspaper equipment in
the world, with 350 exhibitors displaying their wares over 365,000
square feet of exhibition space.
   The show provides an opportunity for manufacturers and suppliers
to the newspaper and graphics arts business to present their
products and services to an international audience of top newspaper
executives.
   Recycling, desktop publishing and telephone technology, along
with other advances in the industry, will be the topics at general
sessions and workshops throughout the three-day event.

   The stock market recovered from its worst drop
since January to open slightly higher this morning.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which was off 53.71
Monday, gained 4.45 to 2,886.63 in the first half hour today.
Monday's fall was the worst loss since it dropped 77.45 points on
Jan. 22.
   Losers and gainers were about even in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 466 up, 478 down and 516

   Volume on the Big Board came to 16.41 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   One analyst said the market was showing signs that Monday's drop
was not the beginning of a large selloff, but rather the start of a
near-term correction. Ralph Acampora, of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. said
there might be some volatity and trading in a 50 to 60-point band
on the Dow, but said the market needs to come down somewhat.
   Many market watchers have noted that the recent rise may not be
supported by corporate earnings.
   Occidental Petroleum, whose debt and preferred stock were
downgraded by Standard &amp; Poors late Monday, was the most active
stock on the NYSE, down ~ at 25}.
   Software Toolworks, which dropped 4~ to 19 in the

A Barron's magazine article raised questions about the hopes behind
the stock's steep rise since last year.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
increased .20 to 195.13. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .21 at 360.55.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances Monday by about 7 to 2 on

<HEAD>Motorola Reports Judge's Ruling in Chip Dispute as Temporary
Setback</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge today ordered Motorola Inc. to
pull a key computer chip off the market, dealing a setback to the
company in a legal battle over trade secrets with former partner
Hitachi Ltd.
   The order also will prevent Hitachi from selling its own
microprocessor in the United States.
   Motorola said it would immediately appeal the decision by U.S.
District Judge Lucius Bunton of Midland. Bunton's order was
released in Austin, where the Motorola's MC68030 microprocessor is
made.
   A microprocessor is a computer chip that handles the processing
functions in a computer.
   In a statement from its Schaumburg, Ill., headquarters, Motorola
said it expected a patent appeals court to stay Bunton's order. The
company said it is confident it would continue to provide an
uninterrupted supply of its market-leading microprocessor to
customers.
   Bunton banned the sale of the chips on March 29 and fined both
companies, saying they violated each other's patents.
   But he stayed the order a day later after Motorola argued that
the chip ban could devastate outside computer makers that depend on
Motorola microprocessors to run their machines.
   Today's order lifts the stay. The judge said the companies had
been given enough time to settle on their own.
   ``The parties have chosen not to forge a settlement in the
interim, and this court is not inclined to continue its
indulgence,'' Bunton said.
   Motorola contends that Bunton's order gives Hitachi unequal
bargaining power in any settlement negotiations because, as Bunton
said in his order, Motorola's processor is more ``commercially
viable'' than Hitachi's.
   Hitachi said it needed the injunction because Motorola could
continue to design around the MC68030, which would eliminate any
incentive for Motorola to settle the patent infringement dispute.
   Tim Kellogg, spokesman for Motorola, said the company would file
its appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
The court is a special appeals court for patents and customs in
Washington.
   ``We are confident that the CAFC will promptly stay the lower
court's decision, pending appeal,'' Motorola said in a statement.
   ``We are dismayed that Judge Bunton made this decision knowing
full well that the two parties have been engaged in earnest
attempts to settle this matter,'' the company said.
   The companies received word of the order Monday, but it was not
released until today.

<HEAD>Japan's GNP Grows 5 Percent in Fiscal Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's economy grew 5 percent in the past fiscal
year, boosted by brisk fourth quarter activity, the Economic
Planning Agency announced Tuesday.
   It was the third straight year in which Japan's gross national
product, the country's total output of goods and services, expanded
5 percent or more. The government had forecast a 4.6 percent rate
for the year.
   In the fourth quarter, which ended March 31, the agency said the
GNP grew an inflation-adjusted 2.5 percent. For the first time in
five years, exports contributed slightly more to economic growth
during the quarter than did domestic demand.
   But increased domestic demand, rather than exports, accounted
for most of the year's economic expansion. Domestic demand
contributed 5.7 percent to total growth, compared to a negative 0.7
percent for exports.
   An agency official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the results showed that Japan's economic expansion, now in its 43rd
month, continues to be led by domestic demand as Japan's economy
shifts away from its past dependency on exports.
   The official said the healthy growth rate in the January-March
quarter showed that the sharp instability in Japan's stock and
currency markets during the period had little impact on the economy.
   From January through March, Japanese stock and bond prices
plunged sharply and the yen weakened to 157.65 yen to a dollar from
143.40 yen.
   However, personal consumption and private capital expenditures,
the main pillars of Japan's current economic expansion, continued
to grow, although at a less rapid rate than during the previous two
quarters.
   GNP growth fluctuated sharply in fiscal 1989, and averaged
slightly lower than the 5.3 percent registered in fiscal 1988 and
the 5.4 percent in fiscal 1987.
   Analysts disagreed about the significance of the 8.5 percent
surge in exports during the fourth quarter, which overwhelmed a 2.1
percent rise in imports.
   The government official said temporary factors such as a sharp
jump in auto exports to the United States in March to fill the
unused portion of Japan's quota under its voluntary export
restraint agreement were mainly responsible for the increase in the
contribution of exports to growth.
   Toshiaki Kakimoto, chief economist with Sumitomo Bank, said
statistics from April should show a return to strong domestic
demand. ``The external sector should become negative again,'' he
said.
   But Kenneth Courtis, strategist and chief economist with
Deutsche Bank in Tokyo, said temporary factors cannot explain all
of the external sector's rebound from a negative 1.0 percent
contribution in the October-December quarter to a positive 1.3
percent in the last quarter.
   Courtis said the yen's weakness together with strong economic
growth in Asia and Europe are more fundamental reasons behind the
surge in exports.
   Now that Japan's markets have calmed down, the Japanese consumer
is back on the street spending at a strong clip, Courtis said.
   ``Japan's economic expansion has been running on two motors:
capital spending and consumer spending. Now exports are starting to
kick into gear,'' he said.

   The stock market recovered slightly today from
its steep drop Monday with buy programs and institutional investors
helping prop up the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
   The average of 30 industrials, which was off 53.71 Monday,
gained 10.64 to 2,892.82 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street today. Monday's
fall was the worst loss since it dropped 77.45 points on Jan. 22.
   Losers and gainers were about even in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 661 up, 547 down and 538
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 45.52 million shares as of 11
a.m. on Wall Street.
   ``There's no place to go but up after a day like yesterday,''
said Thomas Walsh, head of equity trading at Nikko Securities Co.
International Inc.
   Walsh said today's gains were mostly the result of technical
factors and buy programs, which start when stock index futures rise
to high premiums to the cas indexes.
   Institutional investors were sitting on the sideline mostly, he
said. However the stocks institutions were buying were mostly among
the Dow industrials, helping push the average upward.
   Another analyst said the market was showing signs that Monday's
drop was not the beginning of a large selloff, but rather the start
of a near-term correction. Ralph Acampora, of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
said there might be some volatity and trading in a 50 to 60-point
band on the Dow, but said the market needs to come down somewhat.
   Many market watchers have noted that the recent rise may not be
supported by corporate earnings.
   Occidental Petroleum, whose debt and preferred stock were
downgraded by Standard &amp; Poors late Monday, was the most active
stock on the NYSE, down ~ at 25}.
   Software Toolworks, which dropped 4~ to 19 in the
over-the-counter market Monday, gained &rsqb; as the most active stock.
A Barron's magazine article raised questions about the hopes behind
the stock's steep rise since last year.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
increased .56 to 195.49. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .06 at 360.82.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, defying
predictions for an extension of the strong gains posted in the
previous session.
   The early weakness appeared to be centered in the corn market
following Monday's weekly Agriculture Department crop-progress
report showing 97 percent of the nation's corn crop planted as of
Sunday. Soybean planting was 79 percent complete.
   Forecasts for rain in the Midwest today and Wednesday were
considered bearish for the newly planted crops.
   Wheat futures were narrowly mixed after the USDA announced this
morning it had accepted exporters' bids to sell nearly 360,000
metric tons of U.S. wheat to China at subsidized prices.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1{ cents lower to \ cent
higher with the contract for delivery in July at $3.30 a bushel;
corn futures were \ cent to 1{ cents lower with July at $2.85} a

<HEAD>Belgian Airline Sabena Posts New Operating Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Belgian national airline Sabena
Tuesday confirmed it had suffered an operating loss of more than
$36 million in 1989.
   Announcing the results before the group's annual stockholders
meeting, Sabena chairman Carlos Van Rafelghem said: ``We won't be
able to go on living through such situations.''
   Sabena, British Airways and Dutch KLM last year set up Sabena
World Airways. BA and KLM each have 20 percent stakes in the new
operating company.
   The company's senior vice president, Gerard Spinnox, said the
outlook for 1990 was not good, saying the airline could be heading
for an overall loss of $42.8 million for the year.
   Rafelghem said Sabena's flight operations had been ``marginal''
for the year. He said the company may have to ``disinvest'' in the
coming year.
   Although Sabena was adversely affected by both strikes and the
strength of the Belgian franc during 1989, the chairman said that
all European carriers were going through ``a dire patch at the
moment.''
   Commenting on the European Commission's inquiry into the effect
on competition of the Sabena-BA-KLM linkup, Rafelghem said that if
the Commission could prove that Sabena World Airways would hurt
competition, he would have to make changes.
   However, he said that it was not Sabena's intention to interfere
with Dutch and British airline business.

<HEAD>Bahrain Stock Exchange Gearing to Move Into International Phase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bahrain's year-old stock exchange has
recorded satisfactory progress and is gearing to move into the
international phase, its director Fawzi Behzad said Tuesday.
   Speaking at a news conference marking the first anniversary of
the stock exchange, Behzad also announced that the stock exchange
will start issuing in July its ``Awal'' index, emulating such
well-known barometers as the Dow Jones indusrial average.
   Arab Banking Corp., the island's largest of more than 60
offshore banking units, has opened the way for international
dealings by allowing trading of 25 million shares it recently
offered to investors.
   The Arab Banking offering soon will be traded on the Bahrain and
Paris stock exchanges, and later in Kuwait and London.
   ``We're very happy to have ABC, a Bahrain-based company, acting
as a window to foreign investors,'' Behzad said. ``We're opening
the way to the international investors to participate in the local
market.''
   The Bahrain Stock Exchange is expected to seek permission for
resident foreigners to own and trade shares indirectly through
mutual funds and other trusts, he said.
   Only Bahrainis and citizens of the other five Gulf Cooperation
Council member states are allowed to trade on the Bahrain stock
exchange.
   The GCC is an alliance seeking a common market. It groups
Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and the United Arab
Emirates.
   Aside from Bahrain's stock exchange, Kuwait has one that has
been slowly reinvigorated after the 1982 crash of the non-official
Manakh stock exchange under the weight of $94 billion in post-dated
checks. Oman also has a fledgling stock exchange.
   Behzad said the GCC stock exchanges were cooperating to create a
strong capital market in the wealthy Gulf states which sit on
two-thirds of the world's proven oil reserves.
   Behzad said that the first year saw 77.6 million shares traded
and worth the equivalent of about $78.8 million through 3,160
transactions. Transfer of ownership involved 11 million shares
worth $8.1 million through 177 transactions.
   A total of 29 companies are so far listed on the exchange and
ABC will be the 30th.

   Northwest Airlines today named Frederick B.
Rentschler president an chief executive officer to take over duties
handled by co-owner Frederic Malek.
   Rentschler, president and chief executive officer at Beatrice
Co., will manage operations at the nation's fourth-largest airline.
Like Malek, Northwest Chairman Alfred Checchi and co-owner Gary
Wilson, he has no previous airline management experience.
Rentschler also will be a director of Northwest.
   Rentschler, who starts Monday, said he has no fears about coming
from outside the industry. He said the job of chief executive
officer is the same, regardless of what kind of company you run.
   ``It's strategy and direction and deciding how to finance
things,'' Rentschler said at a news conference.
   He said he will be surrounded by 4,000 experienced middle and
upper managers who know the airline industry thoroughly.
   Checchi said Rentschler will bring ``strong consumer marketing
experience'' to the carrier. Checchi and Malek have said they
intend to change Northwest's reputation as a poor performer with
vastly improved service in an attempt to make it America's most
preferred airline by 1995.
   Malek, whose new title is vice chairman, said he is stepping
aside to devote more time to outside commitments. He said he would
continue to play a role in strategic planning.
   ``I have always felt it critical to have a top executive full
time at the helm,'' Malek said in a statement. ``We have that now
in Fred Rentschler, a man who brings added skills and experience to
strengthen our collective leadership.''
   Rentschler is available because Beatrice has agreed to be
acquired by ConAgra Inc. for $1.34 billion. The buyout was
announced June 7.
   Rentschler, 50, is credited with turning around the Swift
Hunt-Wesson foods division of Esmark Inc. before Beatrice acquired
that company. He was forced out in 1984, but returned in 1986, when
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. acquired Beatrice in a $6.1 billion
leveraged buyout.
   In the past three years, Rentschler has overseen numerous
divestitures that included the sale of Avis rent-a-car, a Coca-Cola
bottler, Tropicana Products Inc. and other prominent brands.
   The food business sold to ConAgra is all that remains. Before
working at Beatrice, Rentschler was president and chief executive
of Armour-Dial Inc.
   Investors who put $420 million of equity into KKR's Beatrice
buyout reaped a total of about $2.2 billion from the selloff of its
businesses.
   Beatrice, ranked 25th in the Forbes magazine list of the 400
biggest privately held U.S. companies, had $4.3 billion in sales in
its most recent year. Its brands include Hunt's, Wesson, Orville
Redenbacher's, Manwich, Peter Pan, Snack Pak, Swiss Miss, La Choy,
Swift Premium, and Butterball.
   Northwest ranks 11th on the same list, with annual revenues of
$5.6 billion. Rentschler would go from overseeing a company of
16,400 workers to a company with a work force of 37,000.
   Northwest has been without experienced airline industry
executives in its highest ranks since former NWA chief executive
officer Steven Rothmeier and his four top executives resigned in
October. A group led by Checchi and including Malek and Wilson had
led a $3.65 billion buyout of Northwest in June 1989. All three men
are former executives of Marriott Corp.
   Checchi and Malek said in October the airline will spend $422
million over the next five years to lure customers with better
service. Since Northwest Orient Airlines acquired Republic Airlines
in 1986, performance at the new airline suffered and excessive
complaints about lost baggage and late arrivals continued for
months after Checchi's group bought Northwest.
   Government-issued performance ratings have improved in the past
six months.

<HEAD>Keating Used Lincoln To Finance Real Estate Speculation,
Government Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: New throughout with morning arguments. Also moved on general
news wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Charles H. Keating Jr. used his Lincoln
Savings and Loan Association as a tool to funnel federally insured
deposits into his speculative real estate ventures, government
attorneys argued today.
   ``It was not a true savings and loan association,'' attorney
James Murphy, representing the Office of Thrift Supervision, said
in final arguments to U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision wants the judge to dismiss
Keating's suit, which seeks to revoke the April 1989 seizure of his
Irvine, Calif.-based S&amp;L.
   ``In its essence, it was a real estate investment and
development company and it was being operated in a very high risk
strategy and what was being used were federally insured deposits,''
Murphy said.
   In advance of the closing arguments, Keating said he was
``extraordinarily optimistic'' based on the evidence regulators
presented.
   ``The government took their best shots and there weren't any
shots. There was no powder in their barrel, no bullets in their
gun,'' he said.
   Murphy said the April 1989 seizure of the thrift was neither
arbitrary nor capricious, as Lincoln claims. Nor was the government
out to get Keating, who has an ``almost palpable'' antipathy to
federal regulations and regulators, he said.
   In fact, the thrift office's predecessor, the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board, went out of its way to ensure its examiners were
unbiased, in 1988 switching jurisdiction over Lincoln from its San
Francisco office to Washington.
   ``In retrospect, I think it's fair to say the bank board got
taken in,'' he said.
   Closing arguments from Keating's lawyers were scheduled for
later today, capping 30 days of hearings spread over six months. On
the eve of the session, Keating said in a telephone interview he
believes he has received a fair hearing.
   ``We sure feel we've had our day in court,'' he said. ``I can't
think of anything that to me would have been more fulfilling.''
   Separately, Keating is the target of a federal grand jury probe
in Los Angeles and a defendant in a $1.3 billion civil fraud suit
filed by federal regulators in Arizona, headquarters of his
American Continental Corp. holding company.
   The proceedings before Sporkin, former enforcement director of
the Securities and Exchange Commission, have become Keating's first
chance to present the facts of the case as he sees them. Keating
himself took the stand for eight days.
   The House Banking Committee heard lengthy testimony on the case
last fall, but Keating denounced the hearings as one-sided and
refused to participate.
   The Sporkin hearings began on Dec. 7, less than a month after
the congressional sessions ended, and were originally scheduled for
only two days. But each witness offered and each of the nearly
1,000 documents introduced seemed to raise more questions than they
answered and the court proceedings dragged on.
   In ruling on the government's motion for dismissal, the judge
could uphold the seizure, find it invalid or order a full trial on
the matter, which could take several years.
   Although they were held to help decide a preliminary motion, the
proceedings have, in effect, become a mini-trial for Keating's
claims that he was the target of vindictive regulators who ran his
business into the ground.
   The testimony has focused on four transactions that regulators
said will prove their April 1989 takeover of Lincoln was justified.
In essence, the government contends that Keating arranged for
Lincoln subsidiaries to earn phony profits from fake land and stock
deals in order to funnel the money to his Arizona holding company
via a tax-sharing agreement.
   The four transactions examined at the hearings include the
tax-sharing agreement between Lincoln and American Continental, two
land transactions in Arizona and a stock sale.
   Lincoln's failure will cost taxpayers about $2 billion,
regulators estimate, making it the nation's costliest thrift
collapse.
   The Senate Ethics Committee is examining allegations that five
legislators _ Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz.; Donald W. Riegle, D-Mich.; John Glenn, D-Ohio, and John
McCain, R-Ariz. _ improperly intervened with federal regulators
after accepting political contributions from Keating.

   Share prices finished little changed on London's
Stock Exchange after a sluggish session Tuesday.
   There were few developments to inspire investors, dealers said.
   The lack of British economic indicators and major corporate
news, combined with the Royal Ascot horse race meeting, kept
investment interest at a minimum, dealers said.
   The London market opened nearly 25 points lower because of a
sharp drop on Wall Street Monday. But dealers said there was no
outright selling and the lower levels inspired some genuine
institutional interest.
   ``Institutions are reluctant to sell any stock so close to the
end of the quarter,'' one market maker said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 0.8
point, or 0.03 percent, lower at 2,369.7, near the day's best level
of 2,372.9.
   The low for the day was 2,348.9 and came early in trading.
   The Financial Times 30-share index fell 4.5 points to close at
1,907.4. The Financial Times 500-share index fell 1.67 points to
close at 1,284.16.
   Volume came to a light 408.3 million shares, little changed from
403.4 million shares Monday.

<HEAD>Report: GM to Manufacture 1,000 Natural Gas-Powered Trucks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. plans to become the first
major automaker to produce a fleet of natural gas-powered vehicles,
the Houston Chronicle reported Tuesday.
   A consortium of pipeline companies and producers will help pay
for and purchase the 1,000 light trucks, the Chronicle said.
   The half-ton trucks will be built at GM's plant in Troy, Mich.,
and converted to natural gas by PAS Inc., a Detroit-area supplier,
the newspaper said.
   Quoting industry and state sources, the newspaper said the
announcement had been planned for Wednesday, but would come instead
at July's Economic Summit in Houston.
   GM officials did not immediately return telephone calls this
morning to the Associated Press. The newspaper said GM would not
comment.
   ``This is a way to speed up GM's research,'' said Vicki Cho, a
spokeswoman for Southern California Gas Co., the nation's largest
gas distribution company. ``We need to be involved in making this
happen.''
   The Chronicle said the consortium has agreed to provide as much
as $1 million in funding for the final researching and testing of
the vehicles.
   The consortium _ also expected to purchase many of the GM trucks
_ is composed of about 10 companies in Texas, California and
Colorado.
   Besides Southern California Gas, it includes Entex and Enron
Corp. of Houston; Southern Union Gas Co., Lone Star Gas Co.,
Pacific Gas and Electric and San Diego Gas and Electric.
   Executives representing the companies say the auto giant has
reached a preliminary agreement to produce about 1,000 natural
gas-burning trucks in 1991.
   David Polletta, general manager of PAS Inc., said the vehicles
will be sold under the GM name and guaranteed by a GM warranty
program.
   Industry officials say the GM move is the biggest boost yet for
a natural gas vehicle movement that has been slow to materialize.
   ``From the industry's standpoint, this is something we've been
trying to do for a long time,'' said Susan Syler, a spokeswoman for
Entex, a Houston natural gas distribution company. ``We think that
if we can get one of the Big Three out with these vehicles, the
others will follow.''
   Officials with the Texas General Land Office have been
coordinating the project and had scheduled a briefing for Wednesday
to discuss the GM project. However, spokesman Mark Glick said
Monday that the announcement will be made in July during the
Economic Summit in Houston.
   Officials say an announcement on the project has been delayed
because GM is considering expanding the venture beyond light
trucks. They say GM is may produce a wide range of natural
gas-powered vehicles _ something that gas producers have urged for
years.
   ``That's where the discussions are going,'' said Jack Smith,
natural gas vehicle marketing development manager for Southern
California Gas. ``This could be part of a much larger effort.''
   Because of its environmental advantages over oil-based fuels,
natural gas has in the past year won the favor of Congress and
several state legislatures, which have passed laws requiring use of
the fuel in some of the nation's most polluted cities.
   In many states, lawmakers have instructed public transit systems
and utility companies to begin converting to natural gas.
   Last fall, GM, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. announced a
plan to work with the nation's major oil companies in investigating
the cost of using alternative fuels. The automakers, along with 14
U.S. oil companies, agreed to spend $11.3 million on the research
effort.

a recommendation to ensure that all students leave school with a
high level of basic skills.
   The report, ``America's Choice: High Skills or Low Wages!'',
recommended that no one under 18 be allowed to work unless they
earned a ``Certificate of Initial Mastery'' demonstrating basic
skills, or were enrolled in a program aimed at earning such a
certificate. The AP article did not take note of this second option.

<HEAD>Agreement Reached on Listing All Import Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   World trade negotiators on Tuesday tentatively
agreed that countries should list all charges in addition to fixed
tariffs that importers must pay.
   A spokesman for the 96-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade said the proposed measure would help importers and exporters
by increasing the clarity of import duties.
   Implementation of the accord is dependent on a successful
conclusion to the GATT-sponsored Uruguay round of trade
negotiations. The talks are scheduled to end in December with a
package of new rules to liberalize trade in 15 sectors, including
an agreement to cut tariffs.
   According to the text of Tuesday's agreement, governments would
have to list all ``other duties and charges'' in their schedules of
bound tariff items. A tariff is ``bound'' under GATT rules once a
government gives a commitment not to increase it.
   GATT members would also have to freeze these ``other duties and
charges'' at the rates existing when negotiators reach agreement on
a Uruguay round tariff accord.
   Examples of such charges include fiscal taxes, stamp taxes, port
improvement taxes, import surcharges and landing taxes, according
to a GATT statement.
   Currently governments are under no obligation to publish such
charges. As a result many traders are unaware of their existence
until they import a product. Bound tariffs, by contrast, have to be
listed.
   GATT spokesman David Woods said the proposed measure would yield
``worthwhile, practical results for traders.''
   The GATT statement said the text of the decision was based on a
proposal submitted last year by New Zealand.

   Stock prices inched up in quiet afternoon
trading today and market watchers said many were waiting to see
whether Monday's fall was the start of a downward correction.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which was off 53.71
Monday, was up 0.99 to 2,883.17 by 2 p.m on Wall Street today.
Monday's fall was the worst loss since it dropped 77.45 points on
Jan. 22.
   Analysts said today's quiet activity suggested a collapse was
not likely, but a near-term correction was possible.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 9 to 8 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 650 up, 734 down and
569 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 95.41 million shares as of 2
p.m. on Wall Street.
   ``It's been pretty quiet action. Basically the market is just
buying time,'' said Jon Groveman, a stock market analyst at
Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp; Co.
   Others said the market would likely hover in a range as broad as
2,850 to 2,950 points in the Dow industrial average.
   ``I don't think we're going to see a collapse, but an absense of
buying interest until we get an indication of where the (federal)
budget talks are going,'' said Alan Ackerman, market strategist at
Gruntal &amp; Co.
   Occidental Petroleum, whose debt and preferred stock were
downgraded by Standard &amp; Poors late Monday, was the most active
stock on the NYSE, down 1\ at 25&rsqb;.
   Among other actively traded issues on the Big Board, Chrysler
was up 1 at 16{, International Business Machines was down { at 118\
and Philip Morris was up } at 43{.
   Software Toolworks, which dropped 4~ to 19 in the
over-the-counter market Monday, was unchanged this afternoon as the
most active stock. A Barron's magazine article raised questions
about the hopes behind the stock's steep rise since last year.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
increased 0.15 to 195.08.

<HEAD>Ames Restructuring Brings Substantial First-Quarter Losses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET L. CAPPIELLO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ames Department Stores Inc., struggling
under the weight of bankruptcy proceedings, reported first-quarter
losses of more than $430 million Tuesday, due mainly to its plans
to close nearly one-third of its 679 stores.
   The nation's fourth-largest retailer, based in Rocky Hill, said
it lost $430.9 million, or $11.56 per share, in the quarter ending
April 28. In the first quarter last year, Ames lost $16.5 million,
or 52 cents per share.
   The loss includes a $225 million charge to cover expected costs
of closing the stores, a $104.5 million charge to cover additional
anticipated markdowns, and an $18 million writeoff for deferring
financing costs.
   Net sales for the first quarter were $934.8 million, compared to
$1 billion for the period last year.
   The results are not surprising, given the company's struggle to
stay afloat through bankruptcy proceedings, a retail analyst said.
   ``Clearly this is a gigantic number, but it is typical of the
process,'' said Howard Davidowitz, chairman of Howard Davidowitz
and Associates, a retail consulting firm in New York. ``You try to
identify unprofitable operations and wipe them out. ... That
doesn't come free.''
   Ames filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on April 25.
   A hearing is scheduled Thursday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New
York on Ames' plan to close the stores, which employ about 17,500
full- and part-time employees. Most of the stores being closed are
former Zayre stores, which Ames acquired in 1988.
   The company employed about 55,000 people at the time of the
bankruptcy filing.
   If the court approves, Ames plans to conduct inventory
liquidation sales and close the stores in August or September.
   ``The majority of our loss in the first quarter reflects actions
which are absolutely necessary to stabilize our business and reduce
losses,'' Stephen L. Pistner, chief executive officer of the
department store chain, said in a prepared statement. ``The store
closings and write-down of inventory represent an important first
step toward our objective of emerging from Chapter 11.''
   The stores being closed are in 16 states: Connecticut, Florida,
Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New
Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode
Island, Virginia and West Virginia.
   Ames also plans to close distribution centers in Plant City,
Fla., and Worcester, Mass. A center under construction in Leesport,
Pa., will be completed if the court approves.
   Davidowitz said it will take another six months to determine
whether the steps Ames has taken will save the company.
   ``The big question is, can Ames really go forward? Is there a
viable company left? The book's out. Nobody knows,'' he said.
   ``It really is a new Ames,'' Davidowitz said. ``They've
addressed all their problems. Now we're going to see how they go
forward.''

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Slip; Grains End Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices fell modestly Tuesday on
the Chicago Board of Trade after the government reported generally
favorable crop conditions.
   Corn and wheat futures ended mixed, though, with selling
interest offset by news of a wheat sale to China and reports of
further rain damage to newly planted corn in soggy central Iowa.
   Monday's weekly Agriculture Department crop-progress report
showed corn planting 97 percent complete as of Sunday and soybean
planting 79 percent finished, about the same as a year earlier.
Conditions of those crops generally were rated fair to good.
   Corn futures rallied late in the session amid reports that
overnight showers had washed away more young corn in central Iowa,
but traders did not consider the reported losses to be critical.
   ``If there has been some corn acreage in Iowa flooded out, they
may come back if they get a week of dry weather and plant soybeans
on that acreage,'' said Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research
Department Inc. in Chicago.
   Wheat futures were supported by the USDA's announcement Tuesday
morning that it had accepted exporters' bids to sell nearly 360,000
metric tons of U.S. wheat to China at subsidized prices.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1 cent lower to 1{ cent higher
with the contract for delivery in July at $3.31{ a bushel; corn was
\ cent to 1 cent lower with July at 2.85} a bushel; oats were 1{
cents to 3\ cents lower with July at $1.40\ a bushel; soybeans were
5\ cents lower to 1 cent higher with July at $5.91{ a bushel.

   The energy futures market ended mostly lower
Tuesday in choppy trading, with unleaded gasoline losing more than
a penny a gallon as dealers cashed in on a recent price runup.
   The July contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline tumbled 1.64
cents to settle at 59.92 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, after gaining 0.05 cent on Monday. Other contract months
also declined.
   Unleaded gasoline was a hot commodity in recent weeks. The
near-month contract has risen about 6 cents a gallon since early
June on seasonal demands and amid reports of tightening supplies.
   But James Steel, an analyst with Refco Inc., said, ``The market
has recognized that gas is overbought.''
   He said dealers eager to cash in on the sharp price increase
decided to dump their gasoline contracts.
   Among other refined petroleum products traded on the exchange,
wholesale heating oil settled 0.43 cent lower at 47.43 cents a
gallon, after losing 0.51 cent on Monday. Other contract months
declined.
   Meanwhile, the July contract for West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, fell 29 cents on the Merc to
close at $15.65 a 42-gallon barrel, extending Monday's 68-cent
decline.
   Steel attributed the drop in crude to the fact that the July
contract was set to expire on Wednesday.
   Other contract months posted smaller losses. The August
contract, for instance, had been up around $17 a barrel before
settling at $16.92 a barrel, down 3 cents.
   In natural gas trading, the July contract closed at $1.536 per
1,000 cubic feet, down from $1.540 on Monday.

<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Maryland families have filed a
lawsuit against Kawasaki Motors Corp. and a West Virginia farm
after their sons were injured in an all-terrain vehicle accident.
   The suit filed Monday in Kanawha County Circuit Court, which
seeks $11 million in compensatory damages and $55 million in
punitive damages, lists the defendants as Kawasaki Motors Corp.,
Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. and Kawasaki Motors Manufacturing
Corp.; and Canfield Farms Inc. of Montrose, W.Va., and owners Loyal
and Donald Canfield.
   According to the suit, Timothy Clark of Baltimore and Brian
Cunningham of Pasadena, Md., sustained severe head injuries when
they were thrown off a four-wheel all-terrain vehicle at the farm
on Sept. 1, 1988.
   The suit claims the Kawasaki companies negligently designed and
manufactured the all-terrain vehicles without adequate printed
warnings. It also claims Kawasaki's advertisements for the vehicles
promoted unsafe uses.
   The suit also alleges the farm owners did not heed warnings from
Kawasaki not to allow children under 16 to ride without supervision
or helmets. Cunningham was 11 at the time and Clark 15.
   Calls to Kawasaki Motors Corp. headquarters in Santa Ana, Calif.
on Tuesday were not immediately returned.

   The dollar continued to fall against major
foreign currencies Tuesday in a market once again dominated by
technical factors.
   Meanwhile, gold prices slipped lower.
   There was no news to affect foreign exchange dealings, and
analysts said the dollar's slide was caused by technical factors,
which also brought the U.S. currency lower on Monday.
   ``A lot of people don't understand why we're down here,'' said
Robert Ryan, chief foreign exchange dealer for Bank of New York Co.
``But it's hard to fight a trend.''
   The British pound rose to a 15-month high against the dollar in
London, a move dealers said was helped when sterling broke above a
chart level of $1.7150.
   Traders also reported some concerns that U.S. interest rates _
which support the dollar when they're at higher levels _ might
decline because of the slowing economy in this country.
   The pound rose to $1.7198 from $1.7130 late Monday in London. In
later New York trading, the pound rose to $1.7225 from $1.7145 late
Monday.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 153.72 yen, down 0.16 from
Monday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 153.65
yen, and in New York, it fell to 153.485 yen from 153.65 late
Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
prices, included: 1.6725 West German marks, down from 1.6760;
1.4090 Swiss francs, down from 1.4157; 5.6230 French francs, down
from 5.6395; 1,227.25 Italian lire, down from 1,230.00; and 1.17385
Canadian dollars, down from 1.17455;
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's
levels were: 1.6712 West German marks, down from 1.6770; 1.4100
Swiss francs, down from 1.4165; 5.6177 French francs, down from
5.6390; 1.8800 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8865; 1,226.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,230.00; and 1.1738 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1727.
   Gold edged 20 cents lower on the Commodity Exchange in New York,
closing at $349.10 a troy ounce. Republic National Bank later
quoted a bid of $347.90 a troy ounce, down 35 cents from Monday.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $348.25 a troy ounce
from $349.45 late Monday.
   In Zurich, gold fell to a closing bid of $347.80 from late
Monday's $348.75.
   In Hong Kong, gold closed at $350.45 an ounce on Tuesday. The
market was closed Monday for a holiday.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid price of $4.84 a

<HEAD>Speculators Sell into Collapsing Orange Juice Futures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Speculators continued to sell heavily into the orange juice
futures market Tuesday, extending to three days a collapse that
analysts attribute almost entirely to bearish chart patterns.
   On other commodity markets, oil and pork futures extended recent
losses; cattle futures advanced; grains and soybeans were mixed;
and precious metals retreated.
   For the third straight day, all contracts for September 1990
through May 1991 delivery of frozen concentrated orange juice fell
the permitted daily limit of 5 cents on the New York Cotton
Exchange. The limitless nearby July contract plunged 9.6 cents to
$1.667 a pound, the lowest close since Dec. 29, the last trading
day of last year.
   The plunge of 23.45 cents, or 12 percent, in the July contract
since Thursday represents the most dramatic retreat to date from
the record high of $2.065 a pound reached on Jan. 22 after a
Christmastime freeze destroyed about one-third of the Florida
orange crop.
   Analysts said the collapse was triggered Friday when the July
price slipped below $1.885, breaking a major trend line and
creating a bear market in the eyes of chart-driven speculators.
   ``Once we broke that, it was Katie-bar-the-door,'' said Ernie
Thomas, commodity specialist with Merrill Lynch Consumer Markets in
Winter Haven, Fla.
   Both Thomas and analyst Esther Eskanasy of Cargill Investor
Services Inc., said hedgers representing various sectors of the
Florida orange juice industry joined the selling in significant
numbers Tuesday, perhaps indicating they either cannot or will not
pay the increases in margin required to maintain bullish futures
positions.
   ``There's not a lot of confidence that prices will be able to
recover,'' said Ms. Eskanasy.
   She said the market may find no substantial support above $1.50
but Thomas said the trade selling could give speculators pause. He
predicted a leveling-off at around $1.60 a pound followed by a
rebound.
   The energy futures market ended mostly lower Tuesday in choppy
trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange ahead of the American
Petroleum Institute's weekly stocks report.
   The report showed a smaller-than-expected decline of 1.2 million
barrels in U.S. supplies of crude oil last week, a
smaller-than-expected drop of 464,000 barrels of gasoline and a
2.9-million-barrel increase in distillate stocks, which was within
expectations.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 29 cents lower to 1
cent higher with July at $15.65 a barrel; heating oil was .43 cent
lower to .19 cent higher with July at 47.43 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .15 cent to 1.64 cents lower with July at
59.92 cents a gallon.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, pork futures extended their
recent losses due to continuing slack demand. Cattle futures were
narrowly mixed ahead of the Agriculture Department's monthly
cattle-on-feed report for the seven largest cattle-producing states.
   The report showed 1 percent more cattle on feed June 1 than on
the same date a year ago. May feedlot placements were even with the
year-ago number while May marketings were 3 percent higher.
   Live cattle futures settled .17 cent lower to .15 cent higher
with June at 77.12 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to
.18 cent higher with August at 85.55 cents a pound; live hogs were
.18 cent to .80 cent lower with June at 60.47 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were 1.13 cents to 1.95 cents lower with July at 63.10
cents a pound.
   Soybean futures prices fell modestly on the Chicago Board of
Trade after the government reported generally favorable crop
conditions.
   Corn and wheat futures ended mixed, though, with selling
interest offset by news of a wheat sale to China and reports of
further rain damage to newly planted corn in soggy central Iowa.
   Wheat futures settled { cent lower to 2\ cents higher with July
at $3.32\ a bushel; corn was unchanged to 1 cent higher with July
at 2.86{ a bushel; oats were { cent to 1 cent lower with July at
$1.41{ a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents lower to 1 cent higher with
July at $5.93\ a bushel.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold futures settled 20 cents
lower across the board with June at $349.10 a troy ounce; silver
was 0.9 cent to 1 cent lower with July at $4.827 a troy ounce.

   Big Board volume totaled 134.93 million shares, up slightly from
133.47 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 163.12 million shares.
   The market fluctuated in a narrow range for much of the day,
breaking free in the afternoon.
   Many market watchers said investors were waiting for indications
of where stocks were headed following Monday's 53.71 point drop in
the Dow Jones industrial average.
   ``It's been pretty quiet action. Basically the market is just
buying time,'' said Jon Groveman, a stock market analyst at
Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp; Co.
   Program trading helped push the market up in the closing hours
as arbitragers tried to take advantage of differences between stock
index futures and the cash value of the stocks that make up the
index, said Thomas Walsh, head of equity trading for Nikko
Securities Co. International Inc.
   Tuesday's close was the ninth highest for the Dow industrials,
but all of the top 10 closes have come since June 1.
   ``I don't think we're going to see a collapse, but an absence of
buying interest until we get an indication of where the (federal)
budget talks are going,'' said Alan Ackerman, market strategist at
Gruntal &amp; Co.
   Citing the light volume this week, Walsh said Tuesday's gain
``was no more of an upbeat than yesterday was a downbeat. ...
Nobody's in the game.''
   Occidental Petroleum, whose debt and preferred stock were
downgraded by Standard &amp; Poors late Monday, was the most active
stock on the NYSE, down | at 26. Occidental said from its Los
Angeles headquarters late this afternoon it would not lower its
$2.50 per share annual dividend.
   The ratings agency said it lowered Occidental because of high
fixed costs.
   Among other actively traded issues, Chrysler was up 1&lsqb; at 16| as
speculation continued over talks about a possible link between the
third-largest U.S. automaker and Fiat SpA of Italy.
   Neither company would confirm details of the talks.
   Boeing was down &rsqb; at 58| and Philip Morris was up 1{ at 44\.
   On the over-the-counter market, Telephonos de Mexico was the
most active stock, unchanged at 1 11-16, Software Toolworks was up
1{ at 20{ and Oracle Systems was up | at 23&lsqb;.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $9.938 billion, or 0.29
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed stocks rose 0.68 to
195.61.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 2.11 to 420.01 and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index rose 1.59 at 358.47.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
0.26 to 460.53. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 360.83, up 0.07.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Slip</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices slipped Tuesday in light trading as
the market shrugged off news that growth in the nation's housing
market dropped to its slowest pace since the last recession.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond lost 7-32 point, or $2.19
per $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which rises when prices fall,
climbed to 8.47 percent from 8.46 percent late Monday.
   The market did not have the expected reaction to the Commerce
Department report that housing starts fell 1.4 percent in May to
the lowest level since October 1982.
   Usually, signs of economic weakness lead to an upturn in bond
prices on the belief that the news will prompt the Federal Reserve
to lower interest rates. Falling rates can boost the value of
fixed-return investments such as bonds.
   But the bond market ``acted perversely,'' said Robert Brusca,
chief economist at Nikko Securities Co. in New York. ``Bond prices
fell on the news.''
   Brusca said the market's reaction may be explained by the fact
that it already was well known that the housing market is weak.
   The reaction also shows the market is more concerned with other
factors, such as upcoming economic reports that include the revised
first-quarter gross national product Thursday and durable goods and
personal income Friday _ and upcoming government bond auctions,
Brusca said.
   William Sullivan, director of money market research at Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc., agreed there was concern among traders about
a possible oversupply of Treasury securities. The government on
Wednesday was expected to announce details of its upcoming auction
of two-year and four-year notes.
   The market's downward path began Friday, when the government
issued a report showing industrial production rose at a
greater-than-expected pace in May. The market interpreted the
report to mean it was unlikely the Fed would ease interest rates
soon, since the report indicated inflation may be rising.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds Tuesday, prices of
short-term governments fell from 1-32 point to 1-16 point,
intermediate maturities fell from 3-32 point to &lsqb; point, and
long-term issues fell as much as \ point, according to Telerate
Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a
bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 0.98 to 1,157,29.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills auctioned Monday traded at
were slipped to 7.98 percent as the discount fell 1 basis point to
7.73 percent. Yields on six-month bills auctioned Monday remained
at 8.06 percent as the discount held at 7.64 percent. Yields on
one-year bills rose to 8.12 percent as the discount rose 4 basis
points to 7.57 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was quoted at 8&lsqb; percent, down from 8\
percent late Monday.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell 3-32 point to 91 16-32. The average
yield to maturity rose to 7.52 percent from 7.51 percent late
Monday.

<HEAD>Chapter 11 Retailers Lose $99.5 Million Last Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied
Stores Corp. lost $99.5 million during the quarter ending May 5,
but the loss was less than expected, the retailers said Tuesday.
   ``Federated and Allied's first quarter results were surprising
only in that they exceeded our expectations for how the business
would perform in the period immediately following the Chapter 11
filings,'' said chairman Allen Questrom.
   ``The companies' strengthening performance during the quarter
indicates that we clearly are moving in the right direction,''
Questrom said.
   Federated lost $57.6 million on sales of $1.01 billion in the
quarter, compared with a loss of $62.2 million on sales of $1.02
billion during the comparable period a year ago, the company said.
   Allied lost $41.9 million on sales of $581.4 million, compared
with a loss of $40.3 million on sales of $572.5 million during the
same quarter last year.
   Federated's chains include Abraham and Straus and Bloomingdale's
of New York, Burdine's of Miami, Lazarus of Cincinnati, Rich's of
Atlanta and Goldsmith's of Memphis.
   Allied's chains include The Bon Marche of Seattle, Jordan Marsh
of Boston, Jordan Marsh of Tampa, Maas Brothers of Tampa and
Stern's of Paramus, N.J.
   The two divisions, which cited $7.7 billion in debts in filing
for U.S. Bankruptcy Court protection in January, operate 260 stores
in 28 states.
   Spokeswoman Carol Sanger said that more important than the $99.5
million loss was the $419 million cash Federated had on hand on
June 6, and the $189 million Allied had on hand that date. At the
same time last year, Federated had $18.8 million in cash, and
Allied had no cash, she said.
   Although Federated received a bankruptcy judge's permission to
obtain up to $400 million, and Allied up to $300 million, in
debtor-in-possession financing, neither company has used any of
that credit, Sanger said.

   Getty Petroleum Corp. said Tuesday that the
U.S. government intends to indict a Getty subsidiary and one of the
company's officers for allegedly conspiring with a customer to
evade federal gasoline excise taxes in 1985.
   Getty said in a release that it was advised by the U.S.
Attorney's Office in Brooklyn that the government intends to seek
the indictment against Getty Terminals Corp. and an unnamed company
official.
   U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney was not available for comment late

   Getty said the allegations are without merit and, if indicted,
the company would defend itself.
   Getty Petroleum Corp. markets gasoline, heating oil and
petroleum products in 13 states.

<HEAD>Amoco, French Both Unhappy With Ruling in Tanker Spill Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for Amoco Corp. and French plaintiffs
both are unhappy with a judge's ruling that Amoco should pay nearly
$160 million in damages for a 1978 oil spill off northern France,
indicating a final settlement is still far away.
   U.S. District Judge Charles Norgle on Monday issued a seven-page
order in the case, spelling out recommended damages for the massive
spill from the Amoco Cadiz tanker. He set July 24 as the date he
would specify final judgments and instructed parties to the lawsuit
to calculate interest owed them.
   Norgle's order says he is in basic agreement with damage
recommendations made last year by former U.S. District Judge Frank
McGarr, who was appointed a special master in the case.
   ``We don't expect to have to pay it,'' Frank Cicero, a lawyer
representing Chicago-based Amoco, said of the expected judgment.
   ``We think Judge McGarr erred on both his legal rulings and his
evidentiary rulings. We believe we'll get it reversed.''
   Cicero said the company believes the shipbuilder, not Amoco, was
at fault in the spill. He said the company will appeal to the 7th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals after the July 24 hearing. The
appeals process could take two years, Cicero said.
   Warren Marwedel, a lawyer for the French plaintiffs, said his
clients will appeal because they believe Amoco is liable and that
the award was too little.
   The order specifies amounts in French francs and British pounds,
which come to about $123.5 million to be paid to the French
national government, local governments and businesses. About $35.9
million would go to the Royal Dutch-Shell Group, the company that
paid for the supertanker's cargo.

<TEXT>
   On Colorado Boulevard, where the little
old lady from Pasadena terrorized other drivers, motorists no
longer have to leave their cars to grocery shop.
   They can cruise instead to a drive-up window for the eggs,
detergent or some of the other 1,400 grocery items, fast food or
household goods at the Drive-Thru Express Store opened by the
supermarket chain Vons Cos.
   The window isn't just another car-crazy California trend. It's
more an example of how supermarkets are trying to compete with
convenience stores, fast-food restaurants and vast ``hypermarkets.''
   ``We think that somebody who's tired today can swing by the
store and pick up dinner for tonight, they can pick up their
detergent to do the laundry, and even pick up a fresh fruit tray
for their breakfast tomorrow,'' said Phil Hawkins, Vons' vice
president of sales. ``And it's all at a good price.''
   Similar setups have been tested at convenience stores in such
cities as Edgeworth, Pa., and Springville, Utah.
   ``There's even a drive-through newsstand in Lancaster,
Pennsylvania,'' said Sheri Aguirre, a spokeswoman for the National
Association of Convenience Stores.
   Markets across the country now include everything from post
offices to bank branches to cafes. Vons, Southern California's
largest retail supermarket chain with 328 stores, is a regional
leader in such experiments.
   In its Hispanic-angled Tianguis markets, for example, mariachis
play on weekends and shoppers can purchase pigs' heads, hand-rolled
tortillas, cactus, and Mexican sweetbreads.
   At its upscale Pavilions stores, you can buy a $50 bottle of
Opus One, the Napa Valley red wine produced in collaboration by
California's Robert Mondavi and Bordeaux's late Baron Philippe de
Rothschild, or some fresh sushi, chocolate amaretto mousse or tiny
red teardrop tomatoes.
   Three Vons stores have convenience stores built into the
supermarket, and more of them are planned, according to spokeswoman
Mary M. McAboy.
   It's one of those Express Stores that has been expanded with the
drive-up window experiment. Ms. McAboy said windows likely will be
tried at other locations, although no final decision has been made.
   Hawkins, the vice president of sales, said that when the
drive-through opened in March, Vons officials estimated
conservatively that 100 drivers per day would use it. The number as
of May was about 200 per day, mostly at mealtimes.
   Express Store items range from corn flakes, cat food and condoms
to specialty pizzas _ the Santa Fe version is topped with blue corn
tortillas and peppers and bean sprouts and ginger top the Chicken
Oriental type.
   On one recent morning, there was no waiting in line at the
unostentatious window. It took 55 seconds for a clerk's voice to
come over the speaker, then 95 seconds to fill the simple order:
some antifreeze, motor oil and mints. The store was out of one
item, a Barron's weekly business newspaper.
   ``It's not that busy during the day,'' said Mieko Becker, an
employee. ``There's a lot more at night when the moms line up for
milk, things like that.''
   No alcoholic beverages are sold through the window, and for now
there's no fresh meat or produce available. ``We think people want
to touch, smell and look at the fresh products,'' Hawkins says.

<TEXT>
   In yet another move to give Northwest
Airlines consumer-oriented leadership from outside the industry,
the company Tuesday named Frederick B. Rentschler president and
chief executive officer.
   Rentschler, president and chief executive officer at food giant
Beatrice Co., will join Northwest Chairman Alfred Checchi and three
other airline novices in top management at the nation's
fourth-largest carrier.
   ``Hopefully one of the strengths that we will bring is that we
will cross-fertilize the company with the expertise derived from
many industries and we feel that that will be our strength,
ultimately,'' Checchi said.
   Rentschler, 50, replaces president Frederic Malek, a co-owner
who will play a smaller role as vice chairman.
   Checchi, Malek and Gary Wilson, all former Marriott Corp.
executives, took control of Northwest last August in a $3.65
billion buyout. Since then, eight of the top 11 posts at Northwest
have been filled by Checchi, members of the buyout group, or
outsiders hired by Checchi.
   Three of the outsiders had no airline management experience,
including chief financial officer John Dasburg, another former
Marriott executive.
   Mark Daugherty, an airline analyst with the securities firm Dean
Witter Reynolds, said Northwest could be making a mistake.
   ``I think it's important to try to get people within the
industry,'' Daugherty said. ``It's a very competitive cut-throat,
low-margin business. I don't think the companies have the liberty
or luxury of breaking new people in.''
   Checchi said he doesn't have an ``ounce of reservation'' about
Rentschler's lack of airline experience. Checchi said Rentschler
will be backed up by 4,000 experienced middle and upper managers,
including two top executives from the regime of former chairman
Steven Rothmeier.
   Rentschler said the job of every chief executive officer
includes strategic direction, setting objectives, communicating
clearly, selecting good employees and motivating them.
   ``Those are leadership qualities which are essential I would say
in any chief executive position _ be they packaged goods, marketing
driven organizations or be it an airline,'' he said.
   Wilson said British Airways PLC Chief Executive Sir Colin
Marshall _ a former Avis Rent-a-car executive _ has proven that an
outsider can run an airline. Wilson said that not having
pre-conceived notions about the industry can give birth to
refreshing ideas.
   Candace Browning, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co. Inc.
in New York, said the hiring of Rentschler fits with Northwest's
emphasis on service.
   ``I think strategically that was the right thing to do,'' she
said.
   Checchi said Rentschler was primarily hired for his ``strong
consumer marketing experience'' in an attempt to improve
Northwest's poor service image. Rentschler is available because
Beatrice has agreed to be acquired by ConAgra Inc. for $1.34
billion. The buyout was announced June 7.
   Rentschler is credited with turning around the Swift Hunt-Wesson
foods division of Esmark Inc. before Beatrice acquired that
company. He was forced out in 1984, but returned in 1986, when
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. acquired Beatrice in a $6.1 billion
leveraged buyout.
   In the past three years, Rentschler has overseen numerous
divestitures that included the sale of Avis, a Coca-Cola bottler,
Tropicana Products Inc. and other brands. Before working at
Beatrice, Rentschler was president and chief executive of
Armour-Dial Inc.
   Beatrice, ranked 25th in the Forbes magazine list of the 400
biggest privately held U.S. companies, had $4.3 billion in sales in
its most recent year. Northwest ranks 11th on the same list, with
annual revenue of $5.6 billion. Beatrice had 16,400 workers while
Northwest has 37,000.
   Malek said he is stepping aside to devote more time to outside
commitments. He has been busy assembling a seven-nation economic
summit in Texas next month for President George Bush. He also is
co-chairman of Coldwell Banker Commercial Group and an investor in
Caterair International, an airline catering business.

<TEXT>
   Governors of the six New England states and
the premiers of five eastern Canadian provinces have agreed to form
a cross-border partnership to promote the region's goods,
especially in Europe.
   The Mystic Covenant, as it is dubbed, pledges the governors and
premiers to work together to market the region, its companies and
its products overseas through joint trade missions and trade shows.
   ``It's clear that increasingly our fates and our destinies are
going to be intertwined,'' said Vermont Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin.
``We've got a head start at being global players by our association
with the Canadian premiers. This lesson can now be applied on a
global scale.''
   The agreement was signed Tuesday at the end of the 18th annual
conference between the governors and premiers.
   The two-day meeting was dominated by discussions about
opportunities in Europe, particularly the plan of the 12-nation
European Community to form a single market in 1992 and the budding
free markets of Eastern Europe.
   Also at the meeting, the six governors reached a separate
agreement to develop a regional strategy on international trade for
New England.
   Neither trade agreement will diminish competition between the
states or between the United States and Canada for foreign capital,
the officials said.
   ``When it comes to attracting foreign investment, we're going to
be competitors and we're going to be healthy competitors against
each other,'' said William Herman, an economic development official
for New Hampshire.
   ``But for the export promotion it makes sense that we try to do
it as a region,'' Herman said.
   The meeting gathered the executives of Massachusetts, Vermont,
Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Maine, Quebec, Nova
Scotia, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick and Newfoundland.
   The governors also accepted a bleak economic forecast from
Nicholas S. Perna, chief economist for Connecticut National Bank.
Perna predicted the region will create few new jobs over the next
30 months and forecast that housing starts will not rebound at all
during the period.
   ``There is light at the end of the tunnel, but it's flatness,''
he said. ``It's not a traditional rebound.''
   The governors also urged Congress to extend funding of the
federal Clean Water Act, which is scheduled to be phased out by
1994. They asked for grants of $2.4 billion a year to build modern
wastewater treatment plants.

<HEAD>Company To Eliminate 1,100 Jobs, Take $35 Million Charge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AKRON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. said it will
eliminate 1,100 jobs and take a charge of $35 million against
second quarter pre-tax profits as part of a restructuring of its
U.S. tire sales and support staff.
   The job cuts will come over the next several months mainly
through layoffs but also through some early retirements, spokesman
Walter C. McClenny said.
   Gene Culler, executive vice president of North American tire
operations, said the reductions would result from the realigning of
operations into 28 sales regions that will report directly to the
company's Akron headquarters.
   Currently, the company has 43 sales districts reporting to five
regional offices.
   Culler said high-tech improvements in Goodyear's tire ordering
and distribution system ``make many of our traditional operations
obsolete in a new era of quality and cost consciousness.''
   Goodyear's earnings have been under pressure recently, with the
company blaming pricing competition, sluggish North American
vehicle production and difficulty containing its own costs. Its
earnings plunged 78 percent in the first three months of this year
to $20.9 million despite a 2 percent gain in sales to $2.69 billion.

   The dollar was higher against the yen Wednesday
morning and share prices rose on the Tokyo Stock Exchange after an
opening slip.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average rose 140.27 points, or 0.44
percent, ending the morning session at 32,180.65. The index lost
336.42 points on Tuesday.
   The dollar was changing hands at 153.93 yen at late morning, up
from 153.85 yen at the opening and 153.72 yen at Tuesday's close.
   The dollar inched up against the yen and the West German mark
following an unsubstantiated market rumor that Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev was forced to step down, dealers said. Prior to
the rumor, the dollar had traded softer against the mark, they said.
   ``The dollar has been weaker against major European currencies,
but it does not lead to the currency's decline against the yen
because there is no specific reason to buy the yen against the
dollar now,'' said Koichiro Amaya, a dealer with Chemical Bank in
Tokyo.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei eased slightly at the outset
because of uncertainties over the foreign exchange market, but it
soon recovered as participants made arbitrage purchases in an
attempt to take profits from price gaps between the spot and
futures markets, said Minoru Shimizu, a trader with New Japan
Securities Co.

   Donald Trump and his bank lenders reached a
tentative agreement Tuesday to restructure the $3 billion debt load
the developer ran up in assembling his real estate empire, a
newspaper reported.
   The New York Times reported in an early edition of Wednesday's
paper that Trump's four lead banks agreed to lend him $65 million
and defer interest and principal payments on about $850 million of
the developer's nearly $2 billion in bank debt.
   The agreement hinges on the four banks getting other lenders,
particularly Japanese banks that are involved in loan syndicates
for Trump, to agree to the deal, the newspaper said. The new loan
package will be secured by nearly every asset in Trump's real
estate and gambling empire, it said.
   The Times cited unidentified people involved in the talks.
   The banks and Trump's spokesman, Dan Klores, refused to comment
on the status of the talks. The four banks are Citicorp,
Manufacturers Hanover Corp., Chase Manhattan Corp. and Bankers
Trust Co.
   Last week, the parties reportedly were close to agreement on a
plan under which Trump would receive a $60 million loan that would
enable him to keep making debt payments. But over this past
weekend, the deal began falling apart as bankers argued over the
contribution each would make and the collateral each would receive.
   Trump has yet to make a roughly $43 million payment due last
Friday on junk bonds used to finance the purchase of Trump Castle,
one of the developer's three Atlantic City hotel-casinos.
   Trump is in technical default on the bonds, but is within a
grace period during which he can still make the payment.
   The developer also has not yet made a $30 million debt payment
due Manufacturers Hanover Corp.
   Trump has about $1 billion in junk bond debt outstanding in
addition to roughly $2 billion in bank debt.
   Trump, who has tried to downplay his problems as they became
public in recent weeks, continued that campaign Tuesday. He put out
a statement announcing the Trump Shuttle _ the northeastern air
service he bought last year from Eastern Airlines _ had made its
monthly interest payment on time.
   Investors, meanwhile, showed some optimism that Trump would be
able to iron out his difficulties and meet his debt payment
obligations.
   Traders reported that Trump casino bonds, which have fallen
sharply recently, recovered some ground Tuesday. The Trump Castle
bonds were trading at about $58 per $100 face amount, up about $2
from Monday, in late afternoon transactions.
   Bonds used to back the Taj Mahal casino were up more than $1 to
$52.50, and Trump Plaza bonds were trading at about $82, unchanged
from Monday.
   The debt restructuring plan is aimed at helping Trump to keep
making his debt payments while waiting for his assets to rise in
value so some eventually could be sold.
   The assets, which include hotels and office and apartment
buildings in New York, have fallen in value due to the slumping New
York real estate and Atlantic City casino markets. Trump Shuttle
also has posted disappointing results.
   The four major banks last week reportedly agreed to provide an
additional $60 million in loans and to temporarily suspend interest
payments. In exchange, the banks would have gotten equity in some
of his properties.
   Bank creditors also reportedly were seeking to force Trump to
give up some of his authority over the day-to-day operations of
Trump Organization.
   If Trump is unable to make the payment on the Trump Castle
bonds, bondholders could claim the property or the casino could be
forced into bankruptcy.
   If Trump went into full default, he could lose his licenses to
operate the casinos.
